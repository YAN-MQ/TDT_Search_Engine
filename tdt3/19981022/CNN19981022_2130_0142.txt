First lady Hillary Clinton campaigned in Detroit today. She's stumping 
for democratic gubernatorial candidate Geoffrey feiger and other candidates. 
Feiger is best known as the lawyer for retired pathologist Jack Kevorkian. 
He has also raised eyebrows for saying outrageous and sometimes offensive 
things in public. Democrats worry his presence at the top of the ticket 
will turn off voters. The first lady's visit is intended to rally 
Michigan democrats.
