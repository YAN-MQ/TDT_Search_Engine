Some people were not at all pleased, though, with our reports on the 
arrest of Augusto Pinochet. Jerry Baustien of La Mesa, California 
wrote in to say that he was outraged by our coverage. Your reporter 
repeatedly referred to him not as former president or ex-leader or 
even former autocrat, but as dictator. If you want to be consistent, 
you'll always refer to the ruler of China as the dictator, likewise, 
the rulers of dozens of other nations who gain power without the benefit 
of free and democratic elections.
