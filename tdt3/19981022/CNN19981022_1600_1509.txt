It's sort of "poltergeist" meets "the wizard of Oz." Two teenagers 
get whisked into the television, and suddenly, the world isn't so 
black and white anymore. Mark Scheerer reports on the new movie "Pleasantville." 
Morning, kids. Better get a move on or you'll be late for school. 
I don't believe this. Either do I. It's a nightmare of Nick at nite 
proportions for two contemporary kids, played by Reese witherspoon 
and toby maguire. Don Knotts, as a strange TV repairman, has somehow 
sucked them into a '50s sitcom called "Pleasantville," where everything's 
not only perfect, it's all black and white. In first-time director 
Gary Ross' screenplay, witherspoon's Mary sue introduces something 
alien to this world. Oh, skip, you can pin me anytime you want to. 
Or maybe I should just pin you. She's the troublemaker who starts 
all the bad stuff in pleasantville, doesn't she? Well I think she 
would seemingly be the troublemaker if what she does isn't so well-received. 
You know, she brings sex to this town, and everybody's thrilled about 
it. But color starts to bleed into "Pleasantville," along with trouble, 
and it's metaphors away! It's about finding out who you are. Who you 
really are. And there's a line in the movie I have where I say to 
Joan Allen, "you shouldn't cover that up." I really think it's about 
tolerance and prejudice and allowing people to be unique, and -- embracing 
those whole variety of feelings. I think the fable says this -- if 
you want to be happy, you've got to be willing to be sad. If you love 
beauty, there's got to be ugliness. If you want success, you've got 
to fail. If you want freedom, there's got to be oppression. One of 
the things it says is that we need to have change. Change is good. 
We need to break out, in a sense. It's really a great metaphor for 
finding yourself and finding your identity. Wasn't that just brilliant? 
It's such a metaphor he stumbled on here. You could mine it forever. 
Ah, but it can't go on forever. Boom! Right there! What do you call 
that? You don't deserve this place. You don't deserve to live in this 
paradise. "Pleasantville" reverses the once-controversial practice 
of colorizing old black and white films. Even fiona apple gives it 
a try in her song from the "Pleasantville" soundtrack. Mark Scheerer, 
"CNN Entertainment News," New York.
