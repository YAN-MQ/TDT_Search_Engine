A newspaper report says controversial baseball team owner Marge Schott 
is being prevented from regaining full control of the Cincinnati Reds. 
"The Cincinnati Post" newspaper says Schott will not resume daily 
operations of the team under a new agreement with major league baseball. 
The report says Schott has signed a letter of intent to sell controlling 
interest in the Reds by the end of the year. Schott was suspended 
from running her team two years ago for making racially insensitive 
remarks. Her ban expired at the end of the World Series. An agreement 
to sell would end Schott's 14-year reign with the Reds.
