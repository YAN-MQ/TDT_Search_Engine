Indonesian President B.J. Habibi has rejected calls for his resignation, 
vowing to stay in office until at least the year 2000. The official 
Antara news agency quotes Mr. Habibi as saying that if he steps down 
in response to street protests, it would open the door for the end 
of democracy. The Indonesian president has said parliamentary elections 
will be held next May, and a new president then will be selected several 
months later. Mr. Habibi took over for former President Suharto five 
months ago.
