Liz, this is not a goofy story. Before Walt Disney gave the world 
Mickey Mouse cartoons, he made a series of short films that combined 
live action and animation. They were about a girl named Alice. A number 
of children played Alice. At least one of them is still alive, and 
recently she was honored at a ceremony held by the Disney Company. 
Virginia Davis is now 79 years old. She was 4 years old in 1923 when 
Disney put her in early Alice cartoons. He went on to make dozens 
of them. Eventually Mickey Mouse made his debut and became a bigger 
star than Alice. Today most of the general public is unaware of the 
Alice films, but the current successors of Walt Disney didn't forget. 
Virginia Davis was honored at a ceremony marking the 75 anniversary 
of the Walt Disney Company. your goofy story for next hour.
