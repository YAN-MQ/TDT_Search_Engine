Ukraine's parliament on Thursday approved the state privatization 
chief, signaling the possible end to a long-running dispute between 
the government and lawmakers over privatization in the country. Lawmakers 
voted 230-112 to appoint President Leonid Kuchma's nominee, Oleksandr 
Bondar, to head the State Property Fund. Under Ukraine's constitution, 
parliament approves the state privatization chief nominated by the 
president. Kuchma has been in a non-stop feud with parliament over 
how to conduct privatization since he was elected president in 1994. 
Lawmakers, whose vote on Thursday followed their rejection of Bondar 
last month, earlier turned down Kuchma's previous nominee for the 
top privatization post, Volodymyr Lanovy, four times. Lanovy served 
only as an acting State Property Fund chairman, which allowed the 
legislators to frequently find fault with his work and limit his authority. 
In addition, parliament has introduced a number of measures in the 
past that seriously hampered the State Property Fund's efforts to 
quicken privatization. Privatization in Ukraine, which showed signs 
of revival at the beginning of 1998, has slowed down sharply. Foreign 
investors have fled the region due largely to the continuing financial 
crisis in neighboring Russia. The State Property Fund has already 
canceled dozens of privatization tenders this year that failed to 
draw at least one bidder. The country's stock market has dried up 
in recent months because there is no demand for shares in Ukrainian 
enterprises. The former Soviet republic has earned about 360 million 
hryvna (dlrs 99 million at the current rate) from privatization since 
the beginning of the year, remaining far behind the 1998 target of 
1 billion hryvna (dlrs 292 million).
