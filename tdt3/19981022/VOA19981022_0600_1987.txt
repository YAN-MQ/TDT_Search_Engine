Turning to news from Asia, Indonesian President B.J. Habibi has vowed 
to stay in office until at least the year 2000, despite calls for 
his resignation. The official Antara news agency quotes Mr. Habibi 
as saying if he steps down in response to street protests, it would 
open the door for the end of democracy. Many student activists have 
called for Mr. Habibi to quit his post immediately because of his 
handling of the nation's economic crisis. The Indonesian president 
has said parliamentary elections will be held next May, and the People's 
Consultative Assembly will select a new president several months later. 
Mr. Habibi took over for former President Suharto five months ago. 
Massive rioting forced Mr. Suharto to resign after 32 years in power.
