And with that we turn to concerns arising from reconciliation. China 
says its friendship with Russia is growing. But adds that the relationship 
should not be seen as a threat to any other country. As VOA's Stephanie 
Ho reports from Beijing the Chinese comments come as Russia defense 
minister is in the midst of a three-day visit to Beijing. Russian 
Defense Minister Igor Sergyev met with Chinese military leaders Thursday 
and gave a speech at the People's Liberation Army National Defense 
University. At a regular news briefing Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Tong Wochong speaking through an interpreter said military 
ties were part of improved political relations between the two former 
enemies. Mr. Chong stressed though that military cooperation between 
China and Russia is not a threat to regional stability. The cooperation 
in between is also conducive to method of peace and stability of this 
region and the world. This kind of cooperation is not directed against 
any third country. Although Mr. Chong did not name any countries specifically, 
his comments appear to address concerns that Chinese military ties 
with Russia are aimed at providing a strategic counter balance to 
US and Japanese influence in Asia. Meanwhile, Mr. Chong said Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin will go to Russia before the end of the year 
on a visit that was postpone because of flooding in China. CHONG We 
believe the visit by President Jiang Zemin to Russia will further 
promote the friendly relations and cooperation between China and Russia. 
Western news reports say members of the Russian defense minister's 
delegations will also discuss the sale of high tech Russian arms to 
the Chinese military. The report says China has expressed an interest 
in Russian submarines and surface naval technology. Russia earns more 
than $1 billion annually from weapon sales to China. More than 70 
percent of the sale so far have been of advance combat aircraft and 
air defense systems. Mr. Segyev's visit comes on the heels of defense 
consultations in Beijing between officials from China and the United 
States. During those talks, the Chinese government warned Washington 
against given toxic military support for rival Taiwan. Stephanie Ho,
