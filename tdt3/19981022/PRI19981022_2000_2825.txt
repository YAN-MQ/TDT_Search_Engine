From THE WORLD's back pages come these noteworthy nuggets. The latest 
volley in the long battle for control of the Himalayan region of Cashmere 
has gone cyber. This picturesque and populous region has been the 
setting for a decade-old standoff between Pakistan and India. Now 
Muslim guerrillas fighting for independence for the region have set 
up a Web site to win support for their cause. And opponents belonging 
to the Indian Army set up their own site for a counter response. That 
second Web site called armyincashmere.com has become the latest battleground 
with comments alternately praising the Indian Army or condemning it.
