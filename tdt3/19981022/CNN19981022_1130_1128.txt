Back on Wall Street -- the Dow is down about 70 points. The NASDAQ 
composite up about 1 1/2. That's "Dollars & Sense." Back to you, Catherine. 
Thank you, Kitty. The Yankees are crowned world series champs again. 
Highlights next, in "Headline Sports." These days, seems like everybody's 
got a Cherokee or an explorer. me? I like to stand out a bit. That's 
why I drive a Subaru outback. With a big cargo bay and all-wheel drive, 
you get all the sport-utility you need. With a smooth ride and better 
gas mileage, the outback is far from ordinary. Like me, really. What 
a weird looking bunch that was.
