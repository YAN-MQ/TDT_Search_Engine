In other European news, former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher 
is calling for the immediate release of General Augusto Pinochet, 
who is being held in London on a Spanish extradition request. In a 
letter published in today's "Times" newspaper, Mrs. Thatcher says 
the general was a good friend to Britain during the 1982 Falklands 
War with Argentina. Mrs. Thatcher writes that the former Chilean dictator 
helped shorten the conflict, saving many British lives. She says Chile 
was one of the few South American countries to support Britain in 
the campaign to regain the Falkland Islands.
