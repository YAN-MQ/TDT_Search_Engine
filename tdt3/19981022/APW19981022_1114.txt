Dmitry Bulykin scored twice in the first half Thursday to lead Lokomotiv 
Moscow to a 3-1 victory over Braga of Portugal in a UEFA Cup Winners 
Cup second round, first leg game. Lokomotiv, semifinalists in last 
season's tournament, dominated throughout. Bulykin opened scoring 
in the 22nd minute on a header from a cross from the left, and kicked 
in his second 13 minutes later when the ball bounced off a Braga player. 
Braga had only one scoring opportunity in the first half, when Karoglan 
Mladen of Croatia fired from 18 meters, but Russian goalkeeper Ruslan 
Nigmatullin saved the goal. Brazil's Odair Borges scored the only 
goal for Braga in the first minute of the second half on a free kick 
from 55 meters (yards) when the ball bounced off the ground and Nigmatullin 
couldn't help his team. Igor Chugainov scored the third goal for Lokomotiv 
on a penalty kick in the 60th minute when Alexander Borodyuk was kicked 
down in the box. Albert Sarkisian, who came in as a substitute, missed 
a prime scoring opportunity for Lokomotive in the 88th minute when 
he found himself in a one-on-one position with the Braga goalkeeper, 
Silva Quim, who was sent off with a red card for holding the ball 
outside the penalty box. Playing a 10-man squad, Braga hardly stopped 
Lokomotiv in the last minutes of the game. About 8,000 fans, including 
200 from Portugal, were at Lokomotiv Stadium.
