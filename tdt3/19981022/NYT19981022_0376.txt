The world's largest initial public offering in dollar terms got off 
to a soaring start Thursday as shares of NTT Mobile Communications 
Network Inc., Japan's largest mobile telephone company, jumped more 
than 19 percent in their first day of trading. The widely anticipated 
new stock closed 750,000 yen above its 3.9 million yen issue price, 
ending at 4.65 million yen, or $39,500. The offering raised 2.13 trillion 
yen, or more than $18 billion, which NTT Docomo, as the company is 
known, will use to pay down debts and make capital investments. The 
biggest initial offering before NTT Docomo belonged to its parent, 
Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Co., which raised $13.6 billion in 
1986. While the issue price was high, about $33,200, analysts said 
the stock was deliberately offered at a discount to insure a successful 
offering and allow individuals, who were allotted 45 percent of the 
initial shares sold, to profit handsomely. Japanese institutional 
investors accounted for much of the stock's jump, according to analysts. 
They were allotted just 25 percent of the offering, but because many 
of them gauge their performance against the Topix index of stocks 
listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, they needed 
to buy more. The Topix is weighted according to market capitalization, 
and NTT Docomo is now Japan's third-largest company by that measure 
behind NTT, which owns 67 percent of NTT Docomo after the offering, 
and the Toyota Motor Corp. Because of its size, the only way institutions 
can hope to match the index is by owning at least some shares of NTT 
Docomo. The rest of the shares were allotted to foreign institutional 
investors. Keiji Tachikawa, the president of NTT Docomo, said the 
company would consider splitting its stock to make it more accessible 
to individual investors. The stock is likely to continue to perform 
well, analysts have said. NTT Docomo controls 57 percent of the Japanese 
cellular telephone market, which continues to grow, and it is poised 
to control a large chunk of the market for cellular data transmission 
if it succeeds in transforming its money-losing PHS voice service 
into a conduit for digital information. In addition, after the stock 
market closed here, the company announced that it expected consolidated 
earnings for the six months that ended Sept. 30 of 85 billion yen, 
a 97.9 percent increase compared with results from the period a year 
earlier. Revenue is expected to rise 11.9 percent, to 1.4 trillion 
yen. Tachikawa said the company would spend 40 percent of the money 
it raised through the offering to pay down debt, while an additional 
40 percent would go to write off debts taken on by its regional units 
to invest in PHS. The rest will go toward capital investment, he said.
