Paul (Gazza) Gascoigne still has a few fans in Rome. The English soccer 
star spent three mostly fruitless years with Lazio of Rome in the 
Italian League earlier this decade. But Thursday, he was offered some 
encouragement by a banner hung from the rafters at the club's Olympic 
Stadium. ``The (fans) are with you in the toughest game ... C'mon 
Gazza,'' read the sign, posted during Lazio's Cup Winners Cup game 
against Partizan Belgrad. Gascoigne entered a drug and alcohol clinic 
earlier this month. His brashness was never appreciated by most Italians, 
and it didn't help that he was sidelined for 12 months while recovering 
from a fractured right leg after a reckless tackle on a Lazio teammate 
during practice.
