Some people may be surprised to find out the CIA is playing a role 
in the mideast peace process. David Ensor reports. For several years 
now, with little publicity, the central intelligence agency has been 
training Palestinian security forces in espionage techniques and information 
gathering against suspected terrorists. CIA director George Tenet 
has made several trips to the region in the last 15 months, and his 
station chief in Israel has sometimes acted as a Mediator in disputes 
between Palestinian and Israeli security services. Now, officials 
say the U.S. proposal at the wye talks would give the CIA an even 
bigger role, as a referee between the two sides. It is a role some 
former intelligence operatives say the agency is well suited for. 
Both sides have already come forward to say that they would like this 
arrangement. We didn't select it. And they like it because they can 
trust the CIA. Under the U.S. proposal, sources say Palestinian terrorist 
suspects wanted in Israel would not be extradited there for trial, 
but the cIA would make sure the Palestinians tried them and punished 
them if there was enough evidence to convict. Critics say the new 
role would involve CIA agents in policymaking and politics. This new 
role would require the United States to play advocate, Ally and judge 
all at the same time, a very difficult juggling act for any outside 
party. The answer from U.S. policymakers is, "what's the alternative?" 
They find that the two sides do trust the CIA enough for it to be 
an effective mediator in these security disputes. So the deal the 
president has returned to the wye plantation in hopes of making includes 
a much bigger role for the agency. David Ensor, CNN, the White House.
