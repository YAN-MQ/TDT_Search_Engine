White House officials meet today with top U.S. oil company executives 
who oppose the U.S. plan for transporting Caspian Sea oil to the West. 
Richard Morningstar, the special adviser to President Clinton on Caspian 
Sea oil, says he is certain there can be what he called a win-win 
situation. The White House wants construction of a $2 billion oil 
pipeline from the Azerbaijani capital of Bhaku to the Turkish Mediterranean 
port of Saihan.
