President Clinton was back at the peace talks in Maryland today. It's 
been a week now. There is progress reported tonight on a package of 
security arrangements to satisfy Israel in exchange for further withdrawals 
of Israeli forces from the Palestinian West Bank. The sticking point 
still is the Palestinian charter, which is still including language 
calling for the destruction of Israel. The hope is for a signing ceremony 
at the White House tomorrow. The U.S. brokered an Israeli/Palestinian 
agreement was nearly two years ago. Then it had to do with the city 
of hebron in the West Bank. ABC's Gillian Findlay has been back to 
see how it's going. There have been some dramatic changes since the 
hebron agreement was signed. Palestinian police now patrol the city. 
In much of hebron it's the Palestinians who have full control. But 
many things have not changed at all. In the last month alone, hebron, 
has seen a Rabbi murdered, an attack on an israeli command post. Palestinian 
who confess who had throwing grenades into this bus station was a 
known militant from hebron. The debate here over who is to blame mirrors 
the debate taking place at the U.S. talks. The Israelis say the Palestinians 
aren't doing enough to prevent terrorism. The Palestinians say it's 
the Israelis that provoke attacks. They complain that Israeli soldiers 
are still quick to harass and arrest palestinian suspects, but ignore 
the crimes committed by hebron's Jewish residents. Many Israelis say 
even though 1,000 of their own soldiers are still here, they feel 
more vulnerable than ever, knowing the Palestinians control the other 
side of town. "They don't fight terror, they encourage it. They incite 
violence." Possess six is one of the few things he shares with his 
neighbor. He has turned his terrace into a cage to protect himself 
from the rocks and bottles he says his Israeli neighbors show. It 
doesn't matter what they decide at the wye plantation, he says, I 
live this reality daily. And you talk about peace. Nearly two years 
after their much-celebrated agreement, neither Israelis nor Palestinians 
here feel secure. Jillian Findlay, ABC News, hebron.
