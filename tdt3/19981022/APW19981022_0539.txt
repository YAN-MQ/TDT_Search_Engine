No arrests will be made in connection with the gasoline pipeline that 
erupted into an inferno over the weekend, a top state official said 
Thursday, but Nigeria's state petroleum corporation has reportedly 
said it will demand that charges be pressed. ``There is absolutely 
no truth in rumors that anybody will be arrested in connection with 
this,'' Walter Fejhabo, the military administrator of Delta State, 
told local leaders in Jesse. The explosion and fire tore through Jesse 
on Saturday while up to 1,000 people were trying to collect gasoline 
spilling from the damaged government-owned pipeline. At least 700 
people were killed, state radio has said. A newspaper report said, 
however, that Nigeria's state petroleum corporation would ask for 
charges to be filed. ``Anyone implicated in the vandalisation of the 
oil pipeline leading to last Saturday's fire tragedy is to be arraigned,'' 
Dalhatu Bayero, chief executive of the Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporation, told the Vanguard newspaper. The article indicated the 
company would demand that charges be pressed against people implicated 
in initially opening the pipeline, not the hundreds who later came 
to scoop up the gasoline. It was not immediately clear whether the 
powerful petroleum company could force the military administrator 
_ the equivalent of a governor in Nigeria's military regime _ to reverse 
his decision. Nigeria's ruling junta has not said if it has plans 
to file charges, though it issued a statement Wednesday saying the 
incident was sparked because of ``the greed of some of the people 
in the community.'' Pickup 6th graf previous, `Meanwhile, medical
