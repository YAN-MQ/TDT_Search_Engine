This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather" 
forecast for Friday. It'll be quiet in the eastern United States, 
a bit on the cool side, but things will warm up as the day goes on 
and we begin to see some southerly winds on the back side of that 
high-pressure area. Meanwhile, showers will continue in the southwest 
in west Texas and we could see some snow above about 10,000 feet in 
some of the southwestern mountains of Colorado. There is a front pushing 
toward the northwest. It will bring not only cooler temperatures but 
some rain as well. Highs on Friday across much of the country, 60s 
and 70s. Across the northeast, just 40s and 50s. We will see a few 
80s in the desert southwest. Looking ahead to Saturday, wet and windy 
weather moves into the northwest. It's dry elsewhere except for some 
thunderstorms that are possible in southern Florida. The northern 
half of the country will see 50s and 60s. We'll see 70s and 80s in 
the south. Sunday, showers move toward the rocky mountains. And on 
Monday, showers into the central plains and continuing in the northwest. 
Don't forget, four-day forecast, 7,200 cities at CNN.com.
