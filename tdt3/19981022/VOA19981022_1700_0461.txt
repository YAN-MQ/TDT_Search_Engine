Terrorism has been a key issue in the Wye Mills talks and there was 
more on terrorism today. This time in The New York Times newspaper. 
The paper reports prosecutors believe there is a link between a group 
of New York-based militants and the international terror network suspected 
of bombing two US embassies in Africa. The Times says Islamic militants 
convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City 
and other plots have links to the terror network led my Saudi exile 
Osama bin Ladin.
