For anyone who fears that heaven is out of reach, here is some consoling 
news about the other place. It seems the gates of hell aren't that 
heavily guarded, and escape is a distinct possibility. The strained 
concept of ``Brimstone'' is that 113 of hell's most vile souls (some 
dead for centuries) have escaped and returned to earth. The man Satan 
chooses to haul them back is Ezekiel Stone, who landed in hell because 
he murdered the man who raped his wife. Stone also happened to be 
an ace New York City detective in the 1980s. Now he can redeem himself 
by bringing the evil dead back home. This show is so high-concept 
that its many concepts collide. Invulnerable to bullets, Stone is 
part detective, part Superman. The show is partly ``The Fugitive'' 
and partly about time travel. It's about good and evil and ``The Twilight 
Zone.'' But always, it is dull. Taking Stone's name literally, Peter 
Horton plays him as stony-faced. After 15 years in hell, you'd think 
he'd show a little more enthusiasm about being alive. And the plots 
are lugubrious and slow, even when they try to be lurid. The escapee 
who is the focus of this week's episode is a priest who is kidnapping 
altar boys, not for sexual purposes but because his insane reading 
of the Bible has convinced him that their deaths will hasten the Second 
Coming. It's icky and boring at once. So is an episode to be shown 
in two weeks, in which a young woman from medieval days tries to have 
sex and incinerates her lovers every time she touches them. (OK, so 
you can run from hell but you can't hide.) Even John Glover, who seems 
ideal for the Devil's role, is low-energy here. Maybe he's trying 
not to overact, but on this show a little scenery-chewing, or any 
sign of life, would have been an improvement. BROADCAST NOTES: `BRIMSTONE'
