..The Mid East peace summit telling Israel and the Palestinians it's 
time to make those hard decisions that will lead to a permanent peace. 
We'll here from our correspondent at the summit site. And we'll visit 
Buxter, Egypt where the ugly scars and memories of terrorism remain. 
The London-based International Institute for Strategic Study says 
a world survey shows an increase in defense spending and the arms 
trade especially in the Middles East. As its friendship with Russia 
grows, China says that relationship should not be seen as a threat 
to any other country. I'm Tom Crosby. And I'm Susan Yawkey. We've 
got those stories, the latest in sports and business news and much 
more, all coming up in this hour of VOA News Now. First, a summary 
of world news. I'm Pat Boder, VOA News.
