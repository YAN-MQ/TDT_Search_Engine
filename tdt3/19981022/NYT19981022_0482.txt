Experts on chemical and biological weapons met here on Thursday to 
examine whether Iraq loaded deadly nerve gas on some of its missiles. 
The meeting took place as the United Nations is set to consider on 
Friday questions posed by Iraq about what it can expect if it reopens 
the country to U.N. weapons inspectors. Neither development holds 
out any sign of a breakthrough in the impasse that began on Aug. 5, 
when Iraq boycotted the United Nations because it wanted to see some 
hope of ending the sanctions imposed on it after it invaded Kuwait 
in 1990. Iraq is now angling for a ``comprehensive review'' of its 
cooperation over the last eight years in destroying its nuclear, chemical 
and missile weapons. It charges the United Nations Special Commission, 
which conducts the inspections, with engaging in a political vendetta. 
Iraq has accused the commission, known as UNSCOM, of being subservient 
to the United States, which is opposed to lifting the sanctions as 
long as Saddam Hussein remains president of Iraq. A senior Western 
envoy described Iraq's attempt to obtain a pledge of some leniency 
as ``a foolish move that makes them look like they are imposing conditions.'' 
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, ``We 
are not willing to do anything until they come into compliance.'' 
If anything, exchanges on Thursday suggested further escalation of 
this confrontation. Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapon inspector 
and head of UNSCOM, accused Iraq of diverting attention from its manufacture 
of the deadly nerve gas VX. ``They are calling us spies,'' he said 
in an interview with Reuters Television. ``The real issue is VX. They 
have never, ever told us the truth of how much of that hideous nerve 
gas they made.'' The United States has reported that in June its military 
laboratory at Aberdeen, Md., found traces of VX on some metal fragments 
of shells taken from a weapons-demolition site in Iraq without UNSCOM 
supervision. Similar tests were conducted on other samples in French 
and Swiss laboratories when Iraq questioned the objectivity of the 
American report. The results of the French tests are unclear; the 
Swiss said they found no trace of the nerve gas in their tests. The 
18 scientists gathered here for an examination of the tests are expected 
to end their meeting on Friday and results are expected to be released 
on Monday. However, the senior Western official said the results might 
not be conclusive. Banking instead on a new and separate comprehensive 
review _ which the Security Council hinted it will accept _ Iraq is 
exploring the possibility of having inspections resume on different 
grounds. The questions raised by Iraq include, among other things, 
whether new inspections could begin immediately after its allows U.N. 
inspectors into the country. The United States had suggested a waiting 
period of six to eight weeks. Iraq also asked whether ``some degree 
of uncertainty will be acceptable'' in evaluating its efforts to destroy 
its weapons, noting that different experts could interpret tests in 
different ways. Iraq also asked whether experts other than UNSCOM 
officials can be included in the effort. And it asked ``in which manner 
would Iraq be invited to participate in the review,'' and what role 
the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, would play. 
In the past Iraq has favored a greater role for Annan.
