Many of our local F.M. and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. You're listening to VOA NEWS NOW. We are here 
to give you a world of information. VOA NEWS NOW takes you wherever 
the news is happening, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. We'll make sure 
you're up to date on the latest activities by Boris Yeltsin, or Boris 
Becker. And we'll keep your interest whether the word "prince" makes 
you think of Britain's Prince Charles or the American recording artist 
formerly known as Prince. You can help us focus in even more on the 
news you want to know about. Write to us with your comments about 
our programming, mailing your postcard or letter to VOA NEWS NOW, 
Washington, D.C., 20547, USA. Or use this e-mail address on the Internet, 
newsnow@voa.gov, with "newsnow" written as one word. It's coming up 
on 11 hours Universal Time. We are now signing off on our short-wave 
service to the Caribbean. Thanks for joining us, and tune in again 
tomorrow at 0 hour Universal Time, when VOA NEWS NOW resumes on 5.995, 
6.13, 7.405, 9.455, 9.775, 11.695, and 13.74 megaherz shortwave. Meanwhile, 
if you're a listener in East Asia or the Pacific, we invite you to 
stay with us as VOA NEWS NOW continues on shortwave on most of our 
present frequencies, and these additional ones, 6.16, 9.645, 9.76, 
and 15.16 megaherz shortwave. It's 11 hours Universal Time. From Washington, 
this is VOA NEWS NOW.
