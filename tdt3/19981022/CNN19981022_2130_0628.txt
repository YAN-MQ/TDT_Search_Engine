Monkey see, monkey do. Researchers are giving rhesus monkeys some 
basic math lessons and getting surprising results. Ann Kellan explains 
in today's "tech trends." Here's the drill -- touch these squares 
in order from one to four. This rhesus monkey can -- one, two, three, 
four. Researchers at Columbia University have taught these monkeys 
the concept of counting, defying what scientists thought monkeys could 
do. It is probably one of the most complicated kinds of performance 
that's been observed with monkeys. Unlike animals that perform tricks, 
researchers say these monkeys actually understand that certain numbers 
are greater or less than others. Monkeys understand, for example, 
that seven is more than six. The way we figured this out was by using 
a video game procedure where we show monkeys pictures. First, the 
monkeys had to learn to touch the pictures in ascending order from 
one to four. If they did it correctly, they got a banana treat. If 
the monkey makes an error, suppose it presses one and then three, 
the screen blacks out. In this way, it can learn by trial and error 
what the correct order is. They made lots of mistakes. And they get 
very frustrated when they get it wrong. Occasionally, for example, 
they try to shake the monitor when they get it wrong. Or bite it. 
Once they learned one through four, researchers tested to see if they 
could apply what they had learned to the numbers five through nine. 
And they did. Susan Carey works with human infants. So this shows 
an abstract understanding of number and the capacity to learn a rule, 
which I think that many people would have been surprised that any 
nonhuman would be able to do. Researchers say the testing done on 
monkeys will help develop experiments on how babies learn. We're very 
interested in how a baby learns to count. Researchers think monkeys 
have a natural knack for numbers and want to test this theory on monkeys 
in the wild. Ann Kellan, "Headline News."
