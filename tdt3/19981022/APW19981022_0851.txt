The Mozarteum school of music has been temporarily closed after cancer-causing 
agents and other life-threatening substances were found in the wallpaper, 
floors and acoustic paneling at the internationally renown center. 
More than a week after the closure on Oct. 15, it was still unclear 
what exactly caused the contamination of the building. Experts said 
the in-house ventilation system may have spread the dangerous materials. 
Interior Minister Caspar Einem ordered the entire building closed, 
raising concern over the possible threat to teachers and students 
after medical investigators found a hgh incidence of leukemia among 
the Mozarteum staff. Professors and students had to move out immediately 
and are being gradually relocated in different university, government 
and other public buildings around town in Salzburg, the birthplace 
of Austria's best known composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Investigations 
into suspected health hazards began in July after reports about a 
large number of leukemia cases among staff members. Chemical and other 
experts discovered on the premises the presence of PCBs, polychlorinated 
biphenils, a toxic substance formerly used in insulating material. 
The day the Mozarteum was closed, its rector, Klaus Ager, said he 
was looking for 20,000 square meters of new floor space, including 
sound-proof halls, for more than 1,500 students, 430 teachers and 
80 other staff members. Government officials in Salzburg said earlier 
this week blood tests would be taken on 20 Mozarteum staff and students 
to determine the extent of possible infestation with what experts 
said are carcinogenic chemicals, including substances that can change 
a person's genetic makeup. The foundation of the famed music school 
dates back to the year 1841. Forty years later, the school was taken 
over by the International Mozarteum Foundation. In 1914, the Mozarteum 
was made a conservatory. The school prospered in particular before 
and after World War II under the directorship of Bernhard Paumgartner, 
a musicologist who specialized in and conducted countless performances 
of music by Mozart. Under Paumgartner, the Mozarteum became an Academy 
for Music and Performing Arts, and in 1970 it was elevated to a university 
of the arts. Its most prominent graduate to date is the late Austrian 
conductor Herbert von Karajan.
