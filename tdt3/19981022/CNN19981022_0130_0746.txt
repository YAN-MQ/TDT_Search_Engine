A look at our top stories in two minutes. Then in consumer news -- 
the NFL kicks off a new project on Wall Street. And later -- actor 
Kurt Russell becomes a military machine for his latest role. These 
days, seems like everybody's got a Cherokee or an explorer. me? I 
like to stand out a bit. That's why I drive a Subaru outback. With 
a big cargo bay and all-wheel drive, you get all THE SPORT-utility 
you need. With a smooth RIDE AND better gas mileage, the outback IS 
FAR from ordinary. Like me, really. What a weird looking bunch that 
was.
