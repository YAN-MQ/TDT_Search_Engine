Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has withdrawn his threat 
to walk out of the Mideast summit, extending the marathon talks at 
least one more day. From Wye Mills, Maryland, VOA's Kyle King reports. 
A statement from the prime minister said Israeli officials want to 
achieve an agreement at the talks and hope there is a similar desire 
on the part of the Palestinians. The dramatic announcement came just 
minutes before the deadline the Israelis had set to walk out. The 
Israelis say there can be no agreement at the talks until the Palestinians 
remove anti-Israeli sentiments from the PLO Covenant and fulfill security 
obligations, including the transfer of suspected terrorists. State 
Department officials say the negotiations will continue. The Clinton 
administration has prepared a written text that it says brings together 
all the points of agreement between the two sides and contains proposals 
for bridging the significant gaps that remain. Kyle King, VOA NEWS, 
Wye Mills. U.S. officials say that the United States still believes 
that it's possible for Israel and the Palestinians to reach an agreement 
on the land for peace issues.
