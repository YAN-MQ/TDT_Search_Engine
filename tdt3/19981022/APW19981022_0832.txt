With Germany soon to be governed from the prewar capital Berlin, outgoing 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned the nation in an interview published 
Thursday against flexing its muscle. Kohl, who championed the idea 
of embedding Germany firmly in Europe during his 16 years in power, 
said Germans must remain committed to the goal. ``We must take our 
task very seriously, but stay far away from any fit of megalomania,'' 
he told the business monthly Capital. The interview was conducted 
last month, before Kohl's resounding defeat in Sept. 27 elections. 
Kohl's successor, Gerhard Schroeder, is the first German chancellor 
with no personal memory of World War II, feeding speculation that 
he will view ties with other European nations, especially France, 
less emotionally than Kohl. Schroeder will lead the government's return 
to Berlin next year. Kohl said young Germans are ``open to the world'' 
and view life in a Europe without war or borders as normal. But he 
acknowledged that a common European foreign policy is still far off. 
``I wouldn't talk about years but decades, human nature being what 
it is,'' he said.
