In Colorado this morning, several news organizations got an E-mail 
from an environmental group that claims it set the fires which destroyed 
parts of the vail ski resort this week. Other environmental groups 
say they heard of the earth liberation front, but they certainly don't 
approve of what they've done. ABC's Tom foreman is in vail tonight. 
The earth liberation front says it started the fires to protest expansion 
of one of the nation's premier ski resorts. Even though the lynx has 
not been seen here for 25 years. We can't deny it. We can't take it 
lightly. We just have to look into it to verify it. That's what we're 
doing now. Little is known about the earth liberation front except 
that it is associated with the animal liberation front. Together they 
have been accused of escalating violence. In Utah, a fur breeding 
company was bombed. In Oregon, forest service property was spray painted. 
In Washington, logging companies have been burned. We've seen pipe 
bombs in Salt Lake City. We've seen attacks, arsons, where there are 
people in the building. Things we have not seen before. So I think 
the earth liberation front is very dangerous, and I'm very worried 
about them. But militant environmental groups such as "earth first" 
say it is fair game to attack property. I think when things that are 
lifeless are damaged, I think that is vandalism. And I think when 
life is lost through violence, that's terrorism. Many environmentalists 
here in vail are frankly terrified that environmental extremists are 
now taking credit for these fires, afraid it will turn the public 
against their cause. Radicalism and violence is not something that 
I believe a majority of the environmentalists believe in. Indeed, 
they say jail is the only place for the people responsible for this.
