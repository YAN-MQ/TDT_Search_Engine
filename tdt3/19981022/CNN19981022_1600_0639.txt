This week on the cold & flu report. Every year experts stress the 
importance of getting a flu shot for the elderly or those with weakened 
immune systems. But doctors say many of the same people may not know 
they could benefit from a pneumonia vaccine, too. Serious pneumococcal 
disease claims some 40,000 lives a year in the United States. The 
vaccine is about 60% effective in warding off pneumonia. It's usually 
given only once in a lifetime. But some may require periodic booster 
shots. Your doctor can help decide if you should get the pneumonia 
vaccine.
