Valerenga slowly regained control over Besiktas and edged the Turks 
1-0 in the first leg, second round of the Cup Winners' Cup Thursday. 
Valerenga's weapons were fast transition and long balls. Three minutes 
into the second half Besikta's goalkeeper Fevzi Tuncay cleared the 
ball in a duel with Valerenga's single forward John Carew. But the 
clearing was not good enough and Bjorn Arild Levernes made it 1-0 
in front of 6,284 fans. ``This was a tactical victory, and the most 
important was not to get any goals against us,'' Valerenga coach Lars 
Tjarnas said. ``I think Besiktas was a little surprised by us, and 
they played as we thought they would. I feel we were well prepared, 
and we deserved the victory, and I counted 7-5 in goal chances for 
us,'' he said. Tjarnas thinks Valerenga has a decent chance to advance 
to the quarter final. ``We have flow in our game, and we have a realistic 
chance of advancing,'' he said. Valerenga started the second half 
with a higher pressure than in the first. The Turks had excellent 
ball control, and dominated the first part of the game, but Valerenga 
slowly regained control. In the last minutes of the game Besiktas 
desperately tried to tie the game, but Valerenga was able to ride 
off the storm.
