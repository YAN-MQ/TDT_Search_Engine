We are Africa bound for today's GeoQuiz and scaling the heights of 
the Sahara as we truck along a mountain range in the northwest corner 
of Chad. This range is might imposing with its highest peak rising 
more than 11,000 feet above the desert floor. But it's the ancient 
paintings and not the peaks that have made these mountains famous. 
Prehistoric rock paintings and carvings were discovered here. Scenes 
of elephants and hippopotami grazing on open plains have intrigued 
scientists for decades. UFO fanatics get excited about them, too, 
since some human figures are dressed in what sure do look like space 
suits. To get here safely, you may need more than a space suit. Visitors 
have to battle temperatures as high as 120 degrees, and the local 
inhabitants work hard to keep travelers out. So what is the name of 
Chad's mountain range that seems utterly alien to this world? The 
answer is just around the corner.
