The European Union has released its economic forecast, saying growth 
remains strong for this year but will slow next year. VOA's Ron Penstein 
in Brussels reports the E.U. revised its forecasts because of economic 
troubles in Asia and Russia. The European Union believes the economy 
of the 15 member countries is sound, but it is not immune from instability 
in Russia and Asia. While its forecast for the rest of 1998 is slightly 
better than the one it issued six months ago, the Union's forecast 
for 1999 has been revised downward. Reduced demand for European exports 
to Asia and Russia, as well as the weakness in the American dollar, 
is expected to make it harder for Europe to sell its products abroad. 
While Europeans are not as exposed to the stock market as Americans 
are, the lack of investor confidence is another factor in the Union 
predicting growth next year will be 2.4 percent, down from its previous 
estimate of 3 percent. Ron Penstein, VOA NEWS, Brussels.
