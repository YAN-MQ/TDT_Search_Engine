Russia's Federal Security Service has detained a man it accuses of 
spying for Estonia, a news agency reported Thursday. Estonian citizen 
Ville Sonn was arrested at a military facility in the western Russian 
city of Pskov, where he was allegedly doing ``visual reconnaissance,'' 
the Interfax news agency said, citing an unidentified source in the 
Federal Security Service (FSB). The FSB did not say when he was arrested. 
The FSB, one of many successors to the Soviet Union's KGB, said Sonn 
confessed that he had been on a mission with Estonia's secret service. 
Estonian embassy officials in Moscow have been informed, Interfax 
said. But Maj. Riho Uhtegi, the head of Estonia's Department for Intelligence 
and Counterintelligence, denied that Sonn was connected with the Estonian 
military intelligence services. The FSB said it would simply expel 
Sonn and not press charges against him. ``The Russian side, taking 
into account insignificant damage (by the alleged spy) and wishing 
to maintain good-neighborly relations with Estonia, has made the decision 
not to initiate criminal proceedings,'' the FSB spokesman said, according 
to Interfax.
