TOKYO (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday that 
he hoped for a breakthrough in the Middle East peace talks now being 
held in the United States. ``I think it is essential we try to make 
some progress in the talks,'' he told reporters while in Japan to 
attend an international conference on African development. Annan said 
he visited the Middle East earlier this year and met with Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. 
The talks in Maryland appeared to be running into trouble. Netanyahu 
threatened to leave in the middle of the night Wednesday unless the 
Israelis won more Palestinian concessions. Netanyahu later agreed 
to stay and work with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 
CIA Director George Tenet on a West Bank security proposal that Israel 
could accept. Annan said Middle East leaders were ``extremely concerned'' 
about rising tensions in the area because of the continuing impasse 
in the peace process. ``I hope we will have a breakthrough in the 
talks,'' he said at a news conference. Annan also chided the United 
States for being behind in dues payments to the United Nations, totaling 
nearly dlrs 1 billion. ``This obviously is a disappointment,'' he 
said. But Annan welcomed the U.S. decision to provide dlrs 17.9 billion 
for the International Monetary Fund. Annan, who is from Ghana, was 
one of the main guests at the three-day Tokyo International Conference 
on African Development, which drew representatives from more than 
80 nations and 40 organizations. Annan was scheduled to leave Tokyo 
for South Korea Thursday. On the conference's closing day Wednesday, 
Tokyo announced new aid for Africa totaling 90 billion yen (dlrs 764 
million) over the next five years for new schools, better medical 
services and cleaner water. The money is part of Japan's official 
assistance for Africa and other developing nations, which totals nearly 
1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.5 billion) a year. Japan is one of the top 
aid-givers in the world. Japan's economy is in recession because of 
a credit crunch caused by debt-laden banks. But its national coffers 
are far from depleted, a major factor that differentiates Japan's 
economic problems from those of poorer Asian nations. Tokyo has repeatedly 
promised to continue aid to Africa, which totals about 80 billion 
yen (dlrs 679 million) a year.
