Lions in south Africa are being killed by something other than hunters. 
The culprit is tuberculosis, a fatal disease they pick up feeding 
on infected Buffalo. It weakens the lie unauns, making them easier 
targets for rivals. 0% of the lions are infected in one part of the 
park. Wildlife officials are considering slaughtering cape Buffalo 
to stop the disease from spreading.
