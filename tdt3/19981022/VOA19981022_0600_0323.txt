The commander of U.S. forces in the Gulf says Iran could have nuclear 
arms within five years and poses a much greater threat to the region 
than Iraq. Speaking in Washington Wednesday, General Anthony Zinni 
said moderate forces do exist in Iran, and added it is not clear they'll 
prevail over political hard-liners who want to go to nuclear arms. 
The general also criticized the U.S. congressional plan to give military 
aid to the Iraqi opposition. I'm Bill Hazard, VOA NEWS.
