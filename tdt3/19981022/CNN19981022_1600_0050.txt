U.S. leaders are calling the mideast peace talks a work in progress. 
With President Clinton on hand, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators 
reached an agreement on security issues today which could include 
CIA intervention in future disputes. Now they will focus on an interim 
agreement for peace. Other issues on the table include revisions in 
the Palestinian charter, the redeployment of Israeli troops and the 
release of Palestinian political prisoners. And many other issues, 
including an airport in Gaza. Jordan's king Hussein has also joined 
the talks. U.S. leaders say there's still work to be done. It covers 
the elements you would expect. It's going to address the question 
of the security, the land, the interim issues. We're very close on 
the subject to the airport. That's something that's been of substantial 
interest to the Palestinians, that is getting the Gaza airport open. 
There are other issues of concern that may or may not be reflected 
in the text.
