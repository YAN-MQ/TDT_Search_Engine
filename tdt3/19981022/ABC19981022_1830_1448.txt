Of all the things we might put honey in, the best may be new honey 
cough. Introducing the first line of cough drops and cough syrup combining 
effective medicine with real honey. To relieve even the worst coughs. 
New honey cough. From the makers of robitussin, mmmm! Naturally. I 
can't afford to have rough hands. Not with my patients. It's a great 
thing that this hospital uses keri. Keri works three ways. It soothes... 
it moisturizes... and protects against dryness. Keri. It's trusted 
therapy for dry skin.
