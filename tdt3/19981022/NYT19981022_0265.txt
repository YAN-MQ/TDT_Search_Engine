``Batman'' meets ``Boogie Nights'' via Hong Kong-style kung fu in 
``Orgazmo,'' Trey Parker's flat-as-a-pancake spoof of superheroes, 
the pornography industry and religious conservatives. In writing and 
directing ``Orgazmo,'' Parker, a creator of ``South Park,'' faced 
an insoluble problem: how do you make a boundary-shattering gross-out 
farce about the porn business that isn't itself pornographic? Having 
the actors wear silly costumes embellished with sex toys just won't 
do the trick. Parker, who was one of the great minds behind the slightly 
more amusing ``Baseketball,'' stars as Joe Young, a squeaky-clean 
Mormon missionary doing door-to-door religious salesmanship on the 
streets of Los Angeles. Barging onto the set of an X-rated film-in-progress 
one afternoon, Joe fends off some menacing guards with an impressive 
martial arts display that prompts the movie's producer, Maxxx Orbison 
(Michael Dean Jacobs), to make Joe an offer he can't refuse: $20,000 
for two days' work if Joe will step into the role of the movie's comic 
superhero, Captain Orgazmo. Because the character wears a mask, Joe 
assumes he won't be recognized. And the use of a stunt double for 
the close-up sex scenes will ensure he won't have to perform any dirty 
deeds that conflict with his puritan values. In a typical scene from 
the movie, which becomes a crossover megahit of Spielbergian proportions, 
the superhero and his sidekick, Choda-boy (Dian Bachar), crash through 
a wall in the nick of time to rescue scantily clad women on the verge 
of being raped. They are immediately rewarded with a voracious orgy. 
Life eventually imitates art. When Joe and Ben (the chirpy young actor 
playing Choda-boy) discover their producer is in cahoots with thugs 
who have been terrorizing the proprietor of their favorite sushi bar, 
they step into their movie roles to wreak justice. Their chief weapon, 
invented by Ben, is a workable real-life version of the superhero's 
magic toy, an orgazmorator, a ray gun that disarms an opponent by 
producing an instant and intense orgasm. Well, as they say, when you've 
seen one orgasm you've seen them all. Once the pair have tested their 
device on a little old lady in a walker and on a vicious guard dog 
that becomes tenaciously amorous, the movie's main running gag is 
exhausted. Late in ``Orgazmo,'' nice, sweet blushing Joe gets to splutter, 
``I'm not a superhero, I'm a Latter-day Saint!'' It's the film's one 
genuinely witty line. ``Orgazmo'' is rated NC-17. There are no hard-core 
sex scenes, but the dialogue leaves nothing to the imagination. PRODUCTION
