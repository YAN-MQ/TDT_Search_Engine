A former Rwandan mayor suspected of murder and violations of the Geneva 
Convention will go on trial before a Swiss military court in November, 
a senior army official said Thursday. Fulgence Niyonteze, 34, is also 
accused of inciting murder while head of the community of Mushubati 
in the Rwandan province of Gitirama, 50 kilometers south west of the 
capital Kigali, during the country's 1994 genocide, army chief auditor 
Dieter Weber said. Niyonteze applied for asylum after arriving in 
Switzerland in 1994. He lived with his family in the western city 
of Fribourg before Swiss authorities arrested him in August 1996. 
If found guilty of the charges, he could be sentenced to a maximum 
of life in prison. The trial begins on November 30 and is expected 
to last two weeks. Several dozen witnesses will testify against Niyonteze 
and some are expected to be flown from their homes in Rwanda. Members 
of the court may visit the country to see the scene of the alleged 
crimes and hear witnesses. The case represents the first occasion 
on which a Rwandan suspected of war crimes has gone before a national 
court. Previously, such cases have only been heard by international 
courts in Arusha, Tanzania and The Hague in the Netherlands. More 
than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus were massacred 
in the Hutu government-orchestrated genocide in 1994. The genocide 
ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994.
