A dozen Vietnamese officials were injured in a second major clash 
with villagers over a land-compensation dispute involving a new golf 
course, a local official said Thursday. Five were hospitalized, and 
two were still being treated a week after the incident, said the official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The clash occurred over a two-hour 
period at Kim No village, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Hanoi, 
when 15 men and five women attacked local officials with spears, swords 
and hoes and vandalized public property, he said. The officials were 
surveying the land to compensate villagers for development of a proposed 
18-hole golf course. The villagers tried to halt clearing of the site. 
No arrests have been made, although five people have been identified 
as suspects, the official said. He described some of the participants 
as drunks, drug addicts and people who had been stripped of Communist 
Party membership. Of the 443 families with land in the proposed golf 
course project, 341 already have been compensated, he said. The rioters 
issued unreasonable demands for the remaining 18 hectares (45 acres), 
including changes to the project and direct negotiation with the investor, 
South Korea's Daewoo Corp., he said. The dispute began in March 1996 
when villagers clashed with authorities over land compensation, leaving 
an unspecified number of officials injured. Three attackers were jailed 
but have since been released, the official said. Police also suspended 
investigation of 25 other people. The official said the local government 
is trying to persuade the villagers to hand over the land by this 
weekend.
