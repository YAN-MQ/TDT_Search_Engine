In the spring of 1994, 60 teen-agers in and around Washington volunteered 
for a theater project based on their lives and conflicts. Black, white 
and of mixed blood, from drifters and prostitutes to prosperous preppies, 
they came together for a year to write and rehearse a musical production 
that was performed in the ornate Warner Theater, not far from the 
White House. Their story forms the basis of ``City at Peace,'' a commendable 
and intermittently captivating documentary directed by Susan Koch 
and produced by Christopher Koch, a team whose extensive television 
credits include ``Blacklist: Hollywood on Trial'' and ``Normandy: 
The Great Crusade.'' Reminiscent of productions ranging from ``A Chorus 
Line'' to ``Small Wonders,'' the splendid 1996 documentary about a 
dedicated violin teacher and her East Harlem pupils, ``City at Peace'' 
makes a strong case for creating harmony and tranquility by bringing 
together people of differing backgrounds in a common enterprise. As 
they tell their confessional stories of broken homes, emotional deprivation, 
murder, rape, hustling, struggle and teen-age pregnancy, these youngsters 
begin to overcome the barriers between them by achieving understanding 
of what their lives have in common. The film's thesis is buttressed 
by the violent reality of life on the city's streets. Two young men 
involved in the production _ D'Angelo, a drifter who is the film's 
most intriguing focus, and Rickey Payton Jr., the son of Rickey Payton 
Sr., the composer of the musical _ are shot during the making of the 
film. And while the results of the overarching enterprise appear worthwhile, 
the documentary also makes clear that an ideal society is not easily 
achieved. But ``City at Peace,'' whose executive producers are Barbra 
Streisand and Cis Corman of Ms. Streisand's Barwood Films Ltd., breaks 
no new ground in expressing its argument. Sensible as it may be and 
sharp-eyed in its choice of focal figures in the musical's cast, the 
film surges only intermittently with emotional power. Coverage of 
the actual performance of the musical seems hurried and muted, although 
an epilogue devoted to the maintenance of bonds among the teen-agers 
and an explanation of what has happened to some of them since the 
performance proves satisfying. Nevertheless, ``City of Peace'' remains 
film in a noble cause. PRODUCTION NOTES: `CITY AT PEACE' Directed

Werner; music by Rickey Payton Sr.; produced by Christopher Koch.
