LONDON (AP) _ ``Bond _ James Bond.'' As introductions go, that one 
by Sean Connery in the 1962 film ``Dr. No,'' went down as smoothly 
as a vodka martini _ shaken, not stirred, of course _ and now tops 
a list of the most famous movie quotes ever. Agent 007's signature 
line beat out memorable deliveries by Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, 
Groucho Marx and Greta Garbo to top the list, drawn up by 10 film 
critics and experts to mark the publication of ``The Guinness Book 
of Film.'' Al Jolson's first words _ ``Wait a minute! Wait a minute! 
You ain't heard nothin' yet!'' _ in the first talkie, 1927's ``The 
Jazz Singer,'' set the stage for the greatest movie quotes. That means 
compilers had 71 years and thousands of movies from which to glean 
the top 10. ``We were looking for quotations that were accessible 
and that had popular appeal on a global scale,'' said Karen O'Brien, 
the book's editor. ``We were also looking for wit and delivery. Delivery 
is important.'' Picking No. 1 was easy, she said, not only because 
Bond's introduction was the first utterance by Connery as 007, but 
also because it is repeated in the 17 subsequent Bond films. The compilers 
reached back to Hollywood's early history for most of the screen gems 
_ six of the 10 are from the 1930s and '40s _ and flipped ahead to 
1994 for the most recent, Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump noting how ``Life 
is like a box of chocolates ...'' The earliest is Greta Garbo in 1930's 
``Anna Christie'': ``Gimme a visky with a ginger ale on the side _ 
and don't be stinchy, beby'' _ her first words in her first talkie. 
``The Guinness Book of Film'' summarizes 1,000 movies by decades, 
and is available now in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, 
Singapore and India. It may be published in other countries later.
