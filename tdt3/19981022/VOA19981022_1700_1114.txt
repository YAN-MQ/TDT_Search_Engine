It sure is. And the fans will be celebrating because the New York 
Yankees have won the World Series for the 24 time in franchise history 
with a 3 to 0 victory over The Padres in San Diego. New York's victory 
Wednesday completed a four game sweep of San Diego in Major League 
Baseball's best of seven championship series. The Yankees scored in 
the sixth inning when Bernie Williams grounded out allowing Shortstop 
Derrick Jeter to cross home plate. New York picked up two more runs 
in the eighth inning, Scott Brosur drove in Jeter and Ricky Ledase 
sacrifice fly gave Paul O'Neill the chance to score. The World Series 
title caps a tremendous season for the Yankees. The team set an American 
League record with 114 wins in the regular season and posted an impressive 
12 and 2 record in the post season. Many fans have already ranked 
the 1998 edition of the Yankees among the best teams in the history 
of Major League baseball. And those New York fans are planning to 
celebrate the victory as VOA's Martin Bush reports. The New York Yankees 
swept the San Diego Padres in four straight games to win Major League 
Baseball's World Series. And on Friday the players will reap their 
tumultuous reward. They'll be honored by a parade up the co-called 
Concrete Canyons of Lower Broadway the same route traveled by past 
heroes. New York's Mayor Rudolph Guiliani will lead the celebration. 
It will come up the Canyon of Heroes and then they'll be a ceremony. 
The ceremony will be at City Hall Park. The most valuable player in 
the 1998 World Series was the Yankees' Scott Brocus who led the team 
in hits and belted two key home runs. I look forward to going back 
and going on that parade. This is the second baseball championship 
the Yankees have won since 1996 and the 24th in their history. Martin 
Bush, VOA News, New York.
