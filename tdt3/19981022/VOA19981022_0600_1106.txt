The New York Yankees have won the World Series for the 24th time in 
franchise history with a 3 to 0 victory over the Padres in San Diego. 
New York's victory Wednesday completed a dominating four-game sweep 
of San Diego in major league baseball's best of seven championship 
series. The Yankees scored in the sixth inning when Bernie Williams 
grounded out, allowing shortstop Derek Jeeter to cross home plate. 
New York picked up two more runs in the eighth inning. Scott Broches 
drove in Jeeter, and Ricky Liddy's sacrifice fly gave Paul O'Neill 
the chance to score. Padres slugger Tony Guinn made no excuses for 
the series sweep, saying his team just faced a much better opponent. 
I think they did everything they needed to do to win. You know, we 
gave them our best shot, especially in games one and three, where 
we had them down, and they bounced back and put runs on the board. 
And so injuries, the flu, you know, any other excuse you can come 
up with, I can't take anything away from them. They played great. 
Scott Broches was named the World Series most valuable player and 
says it was a nice diversion from dealing with his father's bout with 
cancer. This right here is just kind of a culmination of just a lot 
of people's dreams. There's been some very special people in my life, 
you know. I lost my mom to cancer a few years ago, and, you know, 
for my dad to be going through this, you know, it's just been a great 
thing for us to go through to kind of take our minds off, you know, 
some real serious stuff. The World Series title caps a tremendous 
season for New York. The team set an American League record with 114 
wins in the regular season, and posted an impressive 12 and 2 record 
in the post season. Many fans have already ranked the 1998 edition 
of the Yankees among the best teams in the history of major league 
baseball.
