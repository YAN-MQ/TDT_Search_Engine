NBC news "in depth." Tonight, the golden child of the 1996 Olympics. 
The tiny gymnast with the huge talent. Now, Dominique Moceanu is suing 
her parents, seeking what she calls "Emancipation." She was born in 
1981 in Hollywood, California. She got her start in gymnastics just 
three years later. By the time she was 12, she was junior all-national 
champion. Now on the road to the 2000 Olympics, Dominique has run 
away from home. What went wrong? NBC's George Lewis begins tonight's 
"in depth" reporting. The question -- where is Dominique Moceanu? 
On Sunday, the 17-year-old Olympic gold medalist ran away from her 
home in houston, got a lawyer and filed a lawsuit asking to be declared 
an adult, charging that her father has mismanaged her earnings, that 
her trust fund is insolvent. She wants the right to act as an adult 
person, which she will be in accept of 1999. Now she doesn't want 
to be broke at 18. As to where Dominique is right now, neither her 
lawyer nor her court-appointed guardian, Ellen yarrell, will say where 
she is. She is with friends and she is safe. The lawsuit alleges that 
Dominique's earnings went into building this Houston gym, run by her 
father. One of her former coaches calls the place a money pit. I think 
that he definitely took her money and sort of did what he wanted to 
do with it without her knowledge of what he was doing. But last year 
Dominique said she needed the gym. It is not only for me. We have 
training and a lot of kids are coming in there gefting training because 
I needed somewhere to train that was not too far away. This coach 
was fired over the weekend by the gymnast father, and he says this 
was one of the persons that caused his daughter to leave home. Sob 
is after her money, after her estate. a family's friend describes 
her mother as physically sick over this. Camellia is a wonderful mother 
and this is tearing her apart. She told me this morning this isn't 
the Dominique she knows. But the lawyer disagrees. Dominique is not 
being influenced unduly by anyone. There will be a court hearing December 
11th to determine whether the lawsuit goes forward. The parents have 
been ordered not to try to contact her rngs an order they are trying 
to overturn. George Louis, NBC news, Los Angeles.
