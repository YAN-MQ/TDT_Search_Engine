There's a scene in ``Apt Pupil'' in which an old man, a former Nazi 
war criminal, literally takes his marching orders from a clean-cut 
high school boy. The old man moves his feet reluctantly at first, 
then displays a mocking, puppetlike compliance. But as he moves faster 
and faster, something terrible happens: long-dormant evil is rekindled 
and the old man begins to stomp as fiercely as he did for the Third 
Reich. ``Boy, be careful,'' he hisses to his teen-age taskmaster. 
``You play with fire!'' That's the hook for Bryan Singer's first film 
since ``The Usual Suspects,'' adapted from the Stephen King novella 
collection that seems to have been written under a lucky star. (``The 
Shawshank Redemption'' and ``Stand by Me'' come from the same volume, 
``Different Seasons.'') Singer brings his same dazzling craftsmanship 
and clinical precision to another story in which shrewd wickedness 
knows no bounds. And Ian McKellen, Hollywood's improbable It Guy of 
the moment, is irresistible enough to minimize another similarity 
to ``The Usual Suspects'': there's much cruel fascination here, but 
there's nobody to like. ``Apt Pupil'' certainly begins on a hateful 
note, with the discovery by the schoolboy Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) 
that a notorious Nazi is hiding in his town. The boy's next move is 
to confront Kurt Dussander (McKellen), a recluse living under a pseudonym, 
with a blackmail threat. If Dussander doesn't follow orders, Todd 
plans to blow his cover. And what does Todd want in exchange for his 
silence? ``I want to hear about it,'' he says. ``The stories. Everything. 
Everything they're afraid to tell us in school.'' Todd is full of 
questions. (``And once they were in the chamber, how long did it take? 
Like a minute? Five minutes?'') Dussander, for his part, lets down 
his guard and becomes the enthusiastic raconteur. (``And it still 
wasn't enough for Himmler,'' he muses about some awful deed.) But 
rather than dwelling on the past, ``Apt Pupil'' soon evolves into 
a war of nerves as Todd begins realizing he's in for more than he'd 
bargained for. The old Nazi begins to manipulate and haunt him. And 
as the title indicates, Todd is a quick study when it comes to misanthropy. 
``The boy proved to be a very good student,'' Dussander remarks mischievously 
one day, ``but perhaps not in the way his mother and dad envisioned.'' 
Drawing on much of the impressive technical talent behind ``The Usual 
Suspects,'' Singer makes this a handsomely shot (by Newton Thomas 
Sigel), stunningly edited (by John Ottman) feat of gamesmanship. McKellen 
works all of his considerable wiles as a man who keeps his monstrousness 
under wraps. And if Renfro (``The Client,'' ``Sleepers'') can't match 
his complexity, he can put a diabolically wholesome face on Todd's 
budding viciousness. Both actors play their roles so trickily that 
tensions escalate until the horror grows unimaginatively gothic. By 
the time somebody is wielding a shovel as a murder weapon in the basement 
and there's an exclamation of ``Now we'll see what you're made of!,'' 
the story's cleverness is noticeably on the wane. Far from being a 
claustrophobic two-character piece, ``Apt Pupil'' (adapted by Brandon 
Boyce) is full of secondary characters and artful visual contrasts. 
Thus Dussander's lair is a place that time has forgotten, while Todd 
lives the epitome of a privileged, squeaky-clean suburban life. Among 
the film's other characters are Elias Koteas as a mysterious derelict 
who glimpses Dussander at his most outrageous; David Schwimmer as 
the school guidance counselor whose brown shirt and thick mustache 
suit a tale of Nazi evil; Bruce Davison as Todd's clean-cut, oblivious 
father, and Joe Morton as proof that the past will not be denied. 
``Apt Pupil'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or 
adult guardian). It includes profanity, violence and brief nudity 
in the locker-room shower scene that drew fire from the parents of 
teen-age extras while the film was in production. It's a discreet 
sequence that is indeed important to the overall plot. PRODUCTION
