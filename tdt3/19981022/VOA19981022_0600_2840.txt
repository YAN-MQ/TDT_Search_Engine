A recent report points to a major new gender gap in technology. The 
American Association of University Women finds that boys clearly outnumber 
girls in higher-skilled computer courses. Janice Weinman, the association's 
director, told the "USA Today" newspaper that there are subtle messages 
for girls interested in computers, such as video games with violent 
and sports themes aimed at boys. She adds the technology is now the 
new boys' club in our nation's public schools. While boys, she continues, 
program and problem solve with computers, girls use computers for 
word processing, the 1990s version of typing, she says.
