service. We don't raise revenue here by selling advertisements and 
we don't make a profit. We're a public service radio station. We raise

I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come on THE WORLD, on board with the Serbian 
police patrol in Kosovo. And on your car stereo, music inspired by 
one secret agent and a familiar cast of characters. Seven killers, 
a voodoo witch doctor, a living corpse, a gorgeous double agent, 12 
cars, five planes, ten acres of land, a wedding reception, a double 
decker bus, a fleet of speed boats. First though, this news.
