A few last-minute reshuffles as astronauts prepare for a historic 
flight next week. U.S. space officials say Senator John Glenn will 
not participate in one of the medical experiments originally planned 
for him during his upcoming space shuttle flight. The official said 
in Washington yesterday the 77-year-old senator failed to meet all 
the 200 criteria that would qualify him for the test. I don't think 
very many people would make that. They refused to provide specifics. 
Senator Glenn is scheduled to make his historic return to space abroad 
the shuttle "Discovery" October 29.
