Toymaker Fisher-price is recalling up to 10 million battery-powered 
"power wheels" cars and trucks. It's been determined electrical components 
in the vehicles can overheat and cause fires even when they are not 
in use. The consumer product safety commission says the toys have 
caused 150 fires and 9 injuries. Fisher-price says people should remove 
the toys' batteries immediately. Repairs can be scheduled by calling 
1-800-977-7800 or by accessing the company's web site at www.powerwheels.com.
