Criminals beware. You can run but you cannot hide from the cell phone 
police. U.S. law enforcement officials are lobbying to track down 
suspects by using the alleged crook's own cell phone. Police already 
can legally listen in to cell phone conversations but not every cell 
phone company has to the technology to provide the caller's whereabouts. 
Despite some concerns about privacy, law enforcers want the nationwide 
system that would help them stop suspects in their tracks.
