A national survey finds women's sleeping patterns suffer from conditions 
unique to their gender. The national sleep foundation polled more 
than 1,000 women between the ages of 30 and 60. 27% said their work 
suffers and 34% admitted their relationships do, too. 14% of tired 
women say they have fallen asleep while driving. Some women report 
using drugs to get to sleep.
