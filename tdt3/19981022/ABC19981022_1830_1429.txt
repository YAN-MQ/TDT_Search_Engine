One more political note this evening. In Tennessee, the mystery of 
the murdered candidate in Monday's encumbent state senator's Tommy 
burkes was found shot dead in his pickup truck. Tonight, his opponent 
in the race, Byron looper, is wanted for questioning. Police say looper 
is not a suspect, but point out he has not been seen since the night 
before the killing.
