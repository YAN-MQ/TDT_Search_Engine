The NFL is trying to keep in playing form by tackling Wall Street. 
Susan Lisovicz reports on the league's unique money-raising endeavor. 
Set, hike! The national football league needs cash. Faced with surging 
signing bonuses and a rising salary cap, the NFL is forced to borrow 
money to remain competitive. So the league is going to Wall Street. 
At least nine clubs in the league are pooling their debt and offering 
a First of its kind -- an NFL bond. This is a lot more efficient in 
terms of how quickly you can access the market. And, also, probably, 
the rate this collective enterprise will get versus what some teams 
get has to be a positive. The NFL is primarily using its unprecedented 
$18 billion TV contract over seven years as collateral for the bonds, 
which carry a Maturity of ten years. But football ratings are down. 
And while S&P has given the NFL bonds an investment-grade "bbb" rating, 
investors say they have concerns. The two main risks would come from 
the collective bargaining agreement that's due up in 2004, I believe, 
which is before the maturity of the bonds. And also the television 
contract revenues, which are very strong. You know, we've had the 
record-level contracts recently. However, they are due also before 
the maturity of this bond. Those are exactly the kind of concerns 
that could prevent other professional sports leagues from courting 
Wall Street. The NBA has already lost part of this year's season because 
of labor problems. And major league baseball is enjoying its first 
good TV ratings following its disastrous 1994 players strike. Susan
