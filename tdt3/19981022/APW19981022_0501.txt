BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament agreed Thursday to 
release the European Union's humanitarian aid budget for 1999 despite 
recent fraud allegations. The EU assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, 
France, voted 421-81 to unblock 330 million European currency units 
(dlrs 396 million) in humanitarian aid for next year. There were eight 
abstentions. Recent fraud allegations have focused the disappearance 
of 540,000 ecu (dlrs 594,000) from aid contracts earmarked for ex-Yugoslavia 
and Rwanda in 1993-1994. Last month, the Parliament's committee on 
budgetary controls voted in favor of freezing 1999 funding for the 
EU's Humanitarian Office until the fraud suspicions had been cleared 
up. But the Parliament eased its stance after it received assurances 
by Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, that further 
efforts would be made to monitor spending. Santer proposed to create 
an anti-fraud unit that would be independent from the Commission. 
The EU Parliament had raised suspicions that the EU executive body's 
in-house fraud unit helped hide corruption.
