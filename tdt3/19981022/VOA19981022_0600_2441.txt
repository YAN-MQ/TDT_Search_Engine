The presidents of Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe have pledged to launch 
an offensive in the rebel-held eastern section of the Democratic Republic 
of Congo. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe made the announcement 
after one-day strategy talks in Karara among the allies of Congo Kinshasa 
President Lauren Kabila. Mr. Mugabe admitted yesterday that the war 
in the Congo could be a protracted one, but he said the security of 
the people in the region is more important than the resources needed 
for the war. Defense analysts say the allies' threat to move into 
the east could spark a regional war, pitting the government alliance 
against Rwanda and Uganda. Rebel leaders seemed to shrug off the news 
of the threatened offensive against them. The rebels now control about 
a third of the country, which is twice as large as Western Europe.
