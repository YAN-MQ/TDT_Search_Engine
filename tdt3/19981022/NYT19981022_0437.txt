In a mirrored cafe on Palestine Street in Ramallah, the Palestinian 
men smoking water pipes, playing cards and talking politics were deeply 
wary. In a sleek coffee bar in the business district of Tel Aviv, 
the Israeli young professionals sipping espresso were skeptical. And 
in a hilltop market in the West Bank town of Ofra, the Jewish settlers 
buying diapers were not nearly as alarmed as their leadership proclaimed 
them to be. As peace talks between Yasser Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu 
entered their eighth day, Palestinians and Israelis, be they religious 
or secular, found themselves in complete accord today on one thing: 
Wye was not Oslo in their eyes. A legal agreement signed at the Wye 
Plantation in Maryland by two Middle East leaders who deeply mistrust 
each other would not be cause for either the panic or the celebration 
engendered by the Oslo peace accord in 1993. ``I can't believe anything 
I hear when every two minutes, they tell me something else,'' said 
Gilad Reich, 29, a lawyer in Tel Aviv. ``Whatever they decide at Wye 
Plantation, if the attitude is not one of cooperation, it will not 
work.'' From Gaza to the Golan, the waiting game has been excruciating, 
and excruciatingly boring. During the eight days of talks, as their 
leaders hovered between a handshake and a walkout, Israelis and Palestinians 
found themselves engaged in speculations trivial and large: How much 
did Sara Netanyahu's visit by the hairdresser cost? Would Ariel Sharon, 
the new foreign minister, finally consent to shake Arafat's hand? 
Would Netanyahu emerge politically strengthened or weakened by a deal? 
(The consensus: Strengthened, with a realigned, centrist constituency.) 
Mostly, they waited for Wye to be over so they could return to a daily 
routine, putting aside their own hopes and anxieties about the peace 
effort, which were brought to the surface by the lengthening talks 
in Maryland. Israeli and Palestinian radio reported with near certainty 
all day that an agreement was at hand. Supporters of peace were reluctant 
to rejoice, and opponents were hesitant to take to the streets, although 
almost everyone said they had wanted movement of some sort. The 19-month 
stalemate in talks has been a frustration for those who wanted some 
resolution to the issues raised by Oslo. ``They say the longer the 
pregnancy, the more beautiful is the child,'' said Motti Cohen, 43, 
the manager of a falafel shop in Jersualem. ``So apparently it will 
be a beautiful peace because it has been so difficult to deliver.'' 
Cafe Brazil sits opposite the vegetable market on the main street 
of Ramallah on the West Bank, and all day long the men come and go, 
drinking sweet hot tea and talking of deceptions. ``What is a piece 
of paper?'' said Abu Othman, 61, a farmer from a nearby village. ``Netanyahu 
will not implement anything.'' His cafe companion, Abu Ahmad, 38, 
a laborer, said: ``When he returns, he will surrender to the right 
wing in his coalition. He wants to gain time now. His goal is to blow 
up the process.'' After the Oslo accords and after Israeli troops 
withdrew from their town, they took to the streets with Palestinian 
flags. They whooped and plastered the walls with pictures of Arafat. 
Then many experienced unanticipated hardships: They were locked into 
the territories by frequent Israeli border closings, denied work permits, 
subjected to humiliating harassment at checkpoints. ``We were enthusiastic 
after Oslo until we discovered it meant very little _ or worse,'' 
Abu Ashraf, a physical therapist, said as he dealt a hand of cards. 
``But I think anything we get from Netanyahu will be a victory, because 
it is like water from a stone.'' Many Palestinians said they tried 
to stifle the hope they feel when they dream about a state of their 
own. Steady work, a stable life and a secure future are the more pragmatic 
aspirations they proclaim now. But, at the cafe, when they got talking, 
they acknowledged that some things promised in the agreement would 
change the lives of many. ``In the past our expectations were very 
high,'' said Odwan Nimr, 35, a teacher. ``Arafat talked about our 
becoming the next Singapore. Now we will be content with some more 
land and the small steps of progress. A Palestinian airport, an industrial 
park, safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank, these would be 
a big deal. And here we have to put our hopes in the Americans.'' 
The cafe owner, Abu Ali, came by and smirked. ``The Americans?'' he 
said. ``Only Islam can solve our problems.'' Early Thursday morning, 
the leadership of the Jewish settlers, anticipating a peace agreement, 
threw a protest, but not very many people came. They tried to blockade 
the roads in the West Bank at many key junctures by wrapping themselves 
in prayer shawls and praying on the highways. But at most crossroads, 
they were far outnumbered by the police, and their human fence was 
so porous that Palestinians drove their cars right through. The words 
of the leaders were harsh. Aharon Domb, the director of the settlers' 
umbrella group, called an agreement ``a death sentence for dozens 
of settlements, which will be surrounded by the terrorists of the 
Palestinian Authority.'' But the mood at a typical settlement, Ofra, 
a sprawl of red-roofed homes in the rock hills north of Ramallah, 
was quite calm Thursday. ``Am I happy? No,'' shrugged Yehuda Wiener, 
62, the settlement's treasurer. ``It's a threat, but people here are 
strong. They're not worried.'' The settlers in Ofra, a community of 
about 2,000 religious Jews that is a flagship of the settler movement, 
feel that they have been down this road before. The watershed moment 
was after the Oslo accord was signed, and Israeli troops withdrew 
from the major cities in the West Bank. Suddenly, they were traveling 
to and from home on newly built roads that bypassed Arab towns, but 
the rhythm of their daily lives went unchanged then, as they expect 
and hope it will be now. They are not thrilled. ``If the road connecting 
us north and south will be transferred to the Palestinian Authority, 
life will be worse,'' Leah Hoffman, 52, a teacher, said as she carried 
groceries to her house. ``It won't be pleasant to drive on the road.'' 
And Tali Hass, 25, an English teacher, painted a nightmare scenario 
as she pushed a baby stroller through the quiet streets. ``The Arabs 
will take over land and come and go here as they please,'' she said. 
``There will be shooting on the road.'' Still, like others, she sounded 
more confused than anything else by the prospect of a new reality 
that would startle her preconceptions. ``How will I be able to trust 
a Palestinian police officer?'' she said. ``If he approaches me with 
a gun, is he stopping me for speeding? Is he coming to kill me? Or 
to protect me?'' Far from Maryland, six shopkeepers pushing retirement 
age held their own peace negotiations over a backgammon board in a 
funky pedestrian mall in the Nahalat Shiva neighborhood of Jerusalem. 
Longtime conversational sparring partners, they knew everyone's political 
positions, but no one's last name. ``Ezra, he's a peacenik,'' said 
Baruch Eliyaz, pushing a chip. ``Baruch, he's no Arab lover,'' said 
Ezra Harel, pushing another and claiming a conquest. Harel, 51, a 
gas station owner, said: ``I'm not political, but you feel the tension 
in the air, and enough already. I'm working with Arabs. I feel their 
reaction. I want this agreement because it's better than continuing 
this way, on the path to explosion.'' ``Let me tell you about Arabs 
culturally,'' Eliyaz said to his friend. ``They go to Washington and 
pretend they're Western. But later they never keep their word. The 
paper they sign is as good as toilet paper.'' ``What do you want then?'' 
Harel asked. ``You don't want peace?'' ``I don't want peace,' his 
friend said. ``I want a cease-fire.''
