Brian Cashman was still an assistant general manager with the Yankees 
when an official from the Oakland Athletics raised the possibility 
of trading Scott Brosius to New York last fall. ``I don't think so,'' 
Cashman told Billy Beane, then assistant general manager for Oakland. 
``But let me check with my people.'' Cashman was negotiating, of course, 
immediately responding with lack of interest. But Cashman had communicated 
his own instincts as well: No way. He knew Brosius was coming off 
a bad year, and he knew Brosius would be in line to make a decent 
salary. After Cashman and Bob Watson, then the Yankee general manager, 
checked with their scouts, others assured them that Brosius was worth 
having _ and the rest is history. Brosius hammered two home runs Tuesday 
night in Game 3 of the World Series and singled home the third run 
of the game Wednesday night to help the Yankees wrap up their 24th 
title. It also helped Brosius nail down the Series most valuable player 
award; he finished with 8 hits in 17 times up (.471), including two 
homers and six runs batted in. For the 13-game postseason, Brosius 
batted .383 with six homers and 15 RBI. When the game ended, a jubilant 
Brosius leaped in the air, then joined the swarm of teammates who 
jumped on top of each other. Later, in a jubilant Yankee clubhouse, 
he said, ``To come over here like this, I just feel privileged to 
be a part of this team.'' Holding his MVP trophy, he said: ``I don't 
know what to do with this thing. It's bigger and heavier than anything 
I've ever gotten.'' Brosius batted .300 and drove in 98 runs during 
the regular season. In the estimation of his teammate Derek Jeter, 
he has been the team's MVP _ a pleasant surprise to club executives, 
who had hoped only that Brosius would play solid defense and contribute 
a few hits. ``We didn't know exactly what Scott Brosius was all about,'' 
said Joe Torre, the Yankee manager. ``You pick up a press guide and 
you see numbers, and last year he wasn't that good.'' An understatement: 
Brosius was terrible for Oakland in 1997, a year in which ``everything 
that could go bad did,'' he recalled. ``Everything from just at times 
swinging the bat horribly to other times swinging the bat pretty good 
and being unlucky, and just not feeling real healthy, either,'' Brosius 
said. ``It was just one of those things that kind of snowballed, and 
I was never able to come out of it.'' Brosius batted .203 with 11 
home runs and 41 RBI, with others on the team feeling as if Brosius' 
quiet intensity hampered him as his slump deepened. He had batted 
.304 in 1996, hitting 22 home runs, but given his age of 31, it was 
easy to speculate he was in decline. When Beane called Cashman after 
the 1997 season and told him the Athletics were intent on trading 
Brosius before the Nov. 18 expansion draft, Cashman had his doubts. 
But the Yankees needed a third baseman, having determined to allow 
the aging Wade Boggs to depart as a free agent, and to exile Charlie 
Hayes. Cashman called Ron Brand, the Yankees' West Coast scout. ``This 
guy can play,'' Brand told Cashman, noting Brosius' strong defense 
and the fact that he always played hard and was well liked by teammates. 
Even if Brosius doesn't hit enough to be the everyday third baseman, 
Brand told Cashman, he could be an exceptional utilityman, because 
he could play just about any position. Wednesday, Brand said: ``I 
heard some guys talk about how he was complaining, but I never saw 
that in the way he played. I never saw him complaining in the paper. 
He was always very gracious. He's a model citizen. I figured he just 
had an off year.'' The deal was arranged: The Yankees sent Kenny Rogers 
and $5 million to Oakland for Brosius, who agreed to a $2.5 million 
contract for 1998. But the Yankees wanted protection, as well, and 
signed Dale Sveum to a two-year contract; they knew, too, that the 
minor leaguer Mike Lowell could be an option. By the end of spring 
training, Brosius had won the third-base job and Torre was talking 
about how Brosius was the best he had ever seen at charging in and 
barehanding grounders and throwing to first. He batted .263 in April, 
but on April 22, he drove in five runs against Toronto's Roger Clemens 
with three hits. This is a guy, Cashman thought to himself, that can 
get big hits, and Brosius exploded in May, batting .396. Brosius can 
be a free agent after this season, and his agent had cursory talks 
with the Yankees in June and July. Lowell is waiting for his chance, 
coming off an exceptional season with Class AAA Columbus, but re-signing 
Brosius appears to be a priority in the off-season. He figures to 
be in line for a three-year deal, perhaps for something in the range 
of $4 million to $5 million a season, and has indicated he would take 
less than his market value to remain with the Yankees. ``I anticipate 
we'll knock it out,'' said Cashman, who must also negotiate with free 
agent-to-be Bernie Williams. ``Ultimately, we'd like to keep him, 
though we're protected with Lowell coming up.''
