President Clinton left Washington today to join the Middle East peace 
talks in Maryland. The negotiators are looking over a 20-page draft 
of an agreement. The land for peace deal still needs work according 
to state department spokesperson, James Rubin. The president would 
not rejoin the talks unless there was significant progress. The hardest 
decisions now, at last, are on the table. Israel, the Palestinians, 
the region and the world have very much at stake today. I hope the 
parties will seize this opportunity and not retreat from the clear 
moment to capture the momentum of peace and keep it moving forward. 
The talks were only scheduled to last four days, but are now in their 
eighth day. The Oslo accords call for a permanent peace agreement 
by May 4th, 1999.
