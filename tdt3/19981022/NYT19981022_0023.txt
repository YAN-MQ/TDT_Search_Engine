The night before Game 3 of the World Series here, Yankee pitcher David 
Wells had an unexpected reunion with a group of his friends and former 
teammates from Point Loma High School. ``His old baseball buddies 
arranged it,'' Don Cameron, Wells' brother-in-law, said of the Monday 
get-together at the Brigantine in Point Loma. ``I listened to all 
the great stories these guys remembered from the 1981 and '82 seasons. 
Normally, when David's in town, we get together in Ocean Beach, where 
he grew up. But I think it would have been too big a scene.'' Ocean 
Beach has remained much the same as when Wells grew up there in the 
'70s and '80s. It is a ragged little beach neighborhood that ends 
at the Pacific Ocean and is set apart from hipper Pacific Beach and 
upscale La Jolla by the San Diego River bed. Today, the main street 
of Newport Avenue has the same buildings from 40 years ago, only the 
storefronts have changed to a '90s look, with antique shops, pizza 
parlors, coffee shops and bars like Cheswicks West and the Sunshine 
Co. Wells had been drinking at Cheswicks West the night he broke his 
pitching hand in a fistfight in December 1996, soon after signing 
with the Yankees. ``Cheswicks, Sunshine Co., they are meeting places,'' 
said Antonio (T.J.) Johnson, a 46-year-old actor, Wells' friend since 
they played basketball at the O.B. Recreation Center in the late '70s. 
``Everything about this town comes through here. We don't work hard 
at life in Ocean Beach.'' On any day or night in O.B., as the regulars 
call it, different types of people can be found along Newport Avenue. 
It is not unusual to see teen-agers dressed like flower children mixing 
with a Hell's Angels motorcycle gang, or a Little League team eating 
ice cream nearby. ``People say it's a rough crowd in O.B.,'' said 
John Holmes, 47, a salesman in Ocean Beach and Wells' friend from 
the O.B. Bums basketball league. ``That's overrated. O.B. isn't a 
community; it is an attitude that has its own rules. If a car is stopped 
in the middle of the street on Newport, an Obeatian doesn't honk. 
They wait. Go with the flow. It's so cool. David floats in here and 
doesn't flaunt his greatness. He's the same today as back then _ and 
that was a brash, cool kid, who was super street-smart and spoke his 
mind at 15 years old. No one told him what to do. Except Attitude 
Annie.'' Annie, Wells' mother, died in 1996. ``Unlike the stories 
printed,'' Cameron said, ``Annie was a good mother. She knew David 
was special in baseball. She stayed on him and got him to practice. 
He always had food on the table. It's true she had attitude _ she 
ran with a rough group of guys, the Hell's Angels. On any day, you 
could see 20 bikes outside David's house. He grew up with them. ``But 
David Wells is what he is today because of his childhood. He wasn't 
arrogant; he had confidence that the Hell's Angels buddies would back 
him up on the street. At his high school games, you visualize parents 
watching their kid play. Well, David's crowd was different. Twelve 
or 15 bikers would motor up for the game with Annie. David was never 
embarrassed. He loved his mother, just like he loves his friends. 
And his talent, well, he was a major leaguer at 9 years old, with 
the best arm any of us ever saw.'' It is clear that Wells, 35, who 
was scheduled to pitch Game 5 of the World Series on Thursday if necessary, 
has never forgotten his roots. David Camara, 34, was a center fielder 
on Wells' Point Loma High Pointer team that won a county championship 
in 1982. He accompanied Wells and Wells' 6-year-old son, Brandon, 
to Disneyland last summer when the Yankees were playing the Anaheim 
Angels. ``In high school, we did all the teen-age things,'' said Camara, 
a bread distributor in San Diego, ``cruised the beach, played basketball, 
went to the senior prom. David used to ride his bike to school each 
morning or we'd pick him up. He was always a natural pitcher, but 
he didn't dominate until high school. He could throw the football 
70 yards. Sports was his life.'' The other day, Wells and a friend 
cruised the beach and had lunch at a delicatessen. It seems that all 
of Wells' friends have remained in contact with him throughout his 
baseball career. And all of them have stories to tell that have made 
Wells a legend in Ocean Beach. ``I remember we were in the '82 season 
playing an important game,'' Camara said. ``It was the fifth or sixth 
inning and Dave walked off the mound and brought me in from center 
field. `Hey,' he said, `I'm going to walk the first three guys and 
strike out the next three.' `No, don't,' I said. He walked the first 
three, then turned and gave me a nod. He struck out the next three 
and laughed. That's the O.B. attitude. New York's got to know that 
you can't take the O.B. out of Dave.''
