Brawn without brains can't accomplish much beyond wreaking glorious, 
mindless destruction. That's the message that leaks through ``Soldier,'' 
a high-testosterone science-fiction fantasy starring Kurt Russell 
as a professional fighter trained from birth to be nothing other than 
an efficient killing machine. In the movie's grim opening scenes, 
we watch the education of Russell's character, Todd, who is nurtured 
in an incubator at a special hospital devoted to producing lethal 
warriors. As a boy, Todd learns to watch with unblinking calm while 
attack dogs tear apart a man. He is indifferent when a classmate, 
lagging behind in a long-distance race, is deemed useless and casually 
executed by an instructor. By age 21, Todd's face has frozen into 
an expressionless glare. His name and number are tattooed on one cheek 
and a bicep is inscribed with his war record. Like most science-fiction 
movies, ``Soldier,'' directed by Paul Anderson from a script by David 
Webb Peoples, is much better at the windup than at the pitch. The 
drama begins when Todd, in his 40s and battle-scarred but still one 
of the toughest men alive, suddenly finds his generation of soldier 
about to be replaced by a new genetically enhanced model. In a chilling 
demonstration of technological progress, Todd and two fellow soldiers 
are ordered to fight Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee), the sleek younger 
leader of the new breed, while all four are clinging to rope chains. 
Caine quickly dispatches Todd's cohorts, then Todd collapses, but 
not before putting out one of Caine's eyes. Severely wounded and assumed 
to be dead, the middle-aged warrior is whisked by space-age garbage 
scow to a remote planet that serves as a junkyard and dumped onto 
a giant scrap heap. But the planet, assumed to be uninhabited, turns 
out to have a secret life. The dying soldier is discovered and nursed 
back to health by a colony of hardy, peace-loving space pioneers whose 
ship crashed and left them stranded. In only a few weeks, Todd is 
strenuously working out with a metal punching bag and having flashbacks 
while he bloodies his fists. ``Soldier'' quickly becomes as sticky 
and predictable as a mediocre episode of ``Star Trek.'' Befriended 
by a gentle pioneer settler and his beautiful blond wife, Sandra (Connie 
Nielsen), who discreetly ogles the hunky warrior, Todd has his first 
experiences of human warmth. The couple's little boy, who hasn't spoken 
since he was bitten by one of the nasty green snakes that infest the 
planet, also takes a shine to Todd. But soon the new generation's 
troops, deployed by the arrogant, power-mad bureaucrat who is promoting 
them, show up for a training exercise in which they have orders to 
destroy anyone who happens to be on the planet. The new generation 
is physically stronger and faster than the old, but not as smart. 
The last third of ``Soldier'' is a dull, phony-looking series of fiery 
scenes culminating in an inevitable showdown between Todd and Caine. 
The action is strictly routine. ``Soldier'' is rated R. It has violent 
scenes, including an eye-gouging. PRODUCTION NOTES: `SOLDIER' Directed
