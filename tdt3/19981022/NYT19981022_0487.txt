The Boeing Co. reported third-quarter earnings Thursday that were 
higher than expected, but it warned that the recession in Asia would 
cause it to lose more airplane orders than it had previously estimated. 
Boeing, the aerospace giant based in Seattle, became profitable during 
the quarter after facing production problems and other difficulties 
last year that forced it to take a $1 billion charge. But with the 
economic downturn in Asia threatening to spread to Europe and the 
United States, it appears that Boeing's internal troubles caused it 
to miss out on one of the biggest airplane booms in history. By the 
time next year when the company's airplane division is expected to 
be fully recovered, demand for new jets is expected to be declining. 
For the quarter, the company earned $347 million, or 36 cents a share, 
on $12.7 billion in revenue. The per-share figure was well above the 
average estimate of 27 cents forecast by Wall Street analysts surveyed 
by the First Call Corp. In the period a year earlier, Boeing reported 
a loss of $696 million, or 72 cents a share, on revenue of $11.4 billion. 
``There were puts and takes that got you to the slightly better number 
than expected,'' said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; 
Co. in New York. ``Most of it was driven by other income and tax benefits.'' 
Boeing executives said the company was re-examining its market forecasts 
in light of Asia's economic turmoil. Airlines serving Asia are responsible 
for a large part of the sales of Boeing's 747 jumbojet, its most lucrative 
civilian airplane. But many airlines have reduced their flights in 
the region over the last year or are switching to smaller planes. 
Boeing recently increased production of the 747 and the newer 777 
widebody to five and seven a month but was planning to reduce production 
in the middle of next year. Now, it is considering cutting the production 
rates even further. The company says it is holding 34 completed planes 
in storage while its customers try to come up with the money to pay 
for them or Boeing tries to line up alternate buyers. Meanwhile, the 
company is still struggling to meet its production schedules. To meet 
its target of delivering 550 commercial airplanes this year, it must 
produce 182 during the fourth quarter, more than ever before. Alan 
Mulally, who was named head of Boeing's commercial airplane division 
last month after the ouster of his predecessor, Ronald Woodard, said 
Thursday that Boeing was delaying previously announced plans to begin 
production of 737 narrow-body jets in Long Beach, Calif., so the company 
could focus on meeting its delivery schedule. Boeing was dealt a new 
setback recently when it learned that one of its suppliers had shipped 
it thousands of defective electrical connectors. Mulally said that 
no planes containing the faulty parts had been delivered to customers 
and that enough functioning parts were available to allow production 
to continue. But workers must spend hours inspecting recently completed 
planes to find out which ones were affected and then fix them. Despite 
all its travails and weakening demand for its commercial airplanes, 
some analysts think Boeing, which has seen its stock fall 35 percent 
since April, has turned the corner. Nicholas Heymann, the aerospace 
analyst at Prudential Securities who was one of the first on Wall 
Street to turn bearish on Boeing last year, upgraded his advisory 
on the stock Thursday to ``accumulate'' from ``hold.'' He said that 
Boeing executives were beginning to cut costs and that the company 
would start generating a large amount of cash next year. Indeed, Boeing 
announced a stock repurchase plan in August and said Thursday that 
it spent $364 million to buy 10.6 million of its own shares in September. 
``At this point, we believe people will have to revise upward their 
estimates after having revised them down for six quarters,'' Heymann 
said. Boeing shares closed Thursday at $36.4375, up 43.75 cents, on 
the New York Stock Exchange.
