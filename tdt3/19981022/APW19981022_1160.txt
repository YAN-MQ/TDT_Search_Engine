Lazio of Rome dominated the action but, with a slew of strikers injured, 
failed to find the target Thursday and settled for a 0-0 draw against 
Partizan Belgrade in a Cup Winners Cup second round, first leg game. 
Veteran forward Roberto Mancini came closest to scoring for the Italians 
with 16 minutes left. He took a pass from Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved 
and flicked a lob from just outside the penalty area that hit the 
underside of the crossbar and bounced down just in front of the goal 
line. In the first half, Mancini fed Nedved for an eight-meter (yard) 
shot that Partizan 'keeper Nikola Damjanac deflected away with his 
foot. Lazio had 10 shots on goal to just one for Partizan, but the 
hosts missed the finishing touches of hurt forwards Christian Vieri, 
Chilean Marcelo Salas, Croatian Alen Boksic and Roberto Rambaudi. 
``We played a good game and probably deserved to win. At least we 
did not allow any goals, but the next game will be tough now,'' Lazio 
'keeper Luca Marchegiani said. The site for the return leg is to be 
decided next week and may be moved away from Belgrade because of the 
situation in Kosovo.
