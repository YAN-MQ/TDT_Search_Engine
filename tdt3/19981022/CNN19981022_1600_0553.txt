Authorities in California are using a new device to stop dangerous 
high-speed car chases. The high-tech tire spikes are triggered by 
remote control, like a garage door opener, by a deputy standing well 
out of the way. The spikes pop out to softly puncture only the tires 
of the car being pursued. Good for one use only, the spikes don't 
interfere with other motorists.
