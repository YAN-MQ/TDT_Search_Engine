North Korea says joint military exercises planned by the United States 
and South Korea next week are jeopardizing the four-way peace talks 
under way in Geneva. In a statement, Pyong Yang called on Washington 
and Seoul to cancel the war games. The latest round of four-way peace 
talks began in Geneva Wednesday with North Korea repeating its demand 
for U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea. The same demand led 
to the collapse of the last round of talks in March.
