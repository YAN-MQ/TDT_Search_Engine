He looks just great! For infertile couples, it's the answer to a dream. 
In vitro fertilization has helped many start the family they've always 
wanted. But why is it that one-third of these couples end up with 
twins or more? When an egg and sperm are joined in the laboratory, 
an embryo is created. Many clinics will create several embryos and 
transfer all of them to the mother. It increases her chances of having 
a successful pregnancy. It also increases her chances of having multiple 
births. A study in "the New England journal of medicine" shows transferring 
only two embryos may be the answer. You're not diminishing the patient's 
chance of having a baby by putting back only two embryos, all you're 
doing is diminishing her chance of having a multiple birth. Most infertility 
clinics say they're not yet ready to accept such a limit. But they 
hope new technologies will someday mean it will only take one embryo 
transfer to assure a successful test tube pregnancy. For the latest
