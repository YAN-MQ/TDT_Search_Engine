And speaking of champions, the two-time Major League Soccer Champion 
DC United has defeated the Columbus Crew 3 to 0 to win the Eastern 
Conference Finals and advance to the MLS cup. As VOA's David Bird 
reports, the United will have to battle fatigue as well as a tough 
Chicago team to win its third Major League Soccer title. The DC United 
took the lead in the 12th minute on a goal by Jeff Agus. Then, in 
the 43rd minute, Roy Lassiter scored his third goal of the playoffs 
firing the ball passed Crew Goaltender Yurgen Summer. The game was 
2-0 at half-time and remained that way until the 79th minute when 
Lassiter picked off a Columbus pass and scored again. The United now 
takes on the Chicago Fire which defeated the Los Angeles Galaxy last 
week to earn a birth in the final. DC Coach Bruce Serino says his 
team will have to battle fatigue to over come the tough Chicago team. 
All we can possible do between now and Sunday is try to get our legs 
back. It's all we can possibly do. And believe me we have been preparing 
this week for Chicago. And that's the job of the coaches. And with 
the travel and everything else, we're handicapped big time going into 
this game. That's all part of it, I guess. A win Sunday would give 
DC United its third consecutive Major League Soccer Championship. 
The MLS Cup is Sunday in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. From 
RFK Stadium, I'm David Bird, VOA Sports.
