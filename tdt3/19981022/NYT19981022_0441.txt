WYE MILLS, Md. _ ``Welcome to Day 8 here at the Wye River Middle East 
Peace Conference,'' intoned James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, 
with just a hint of the cabin fever that everyone was beginning to 
suffer. The conference, pitting the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin 
Netanyahu, against the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, with Americans 
as active umpires, had already gone twice as long as anyone intended. 
But then exhaustion has always been the real grease of hard negotiations, 
and there was ample evidence that President Clinton's tactic was to 
keep the two sides cooped up until they gave in or gave out. Netanyahu's 
attempt to foment a crisis by threatening to walk out on Wednesday 
seemed only to make it less likely that he or Arafat could cop out 
on Thursday. Officials disclosed that Secretary of State Madeleine 
K. Albright had anticipated such a move, though she did not know whether 
it would be Netanyahu or Arafat _ both masters at brinksmanship _ 
who would try it. In any event, when asked directly about the onset 
of cabin fever, Rubin issued the mandatory denials. ``I don't think 
`cabin fever' would be appropriate,'' he said. ``What we've tried 
to do is create a balance between having people in the same location 
_ that is, the Wye River facility _ but not on top of each other. 
So the times that they've spent together, there's a lot of walking 
that's done _ walking along the river, walking in the woods _ between 
the key negotiators, and time to look out over nice vistas, time to 
meet in very small rooms.'' Even as he talked, Rubin noted, Clinton 
was meeting with leaders of the two delegations _ in a large room, 
``where there is room to move around.'' The day's main negotiations, 
he said at his next briefing, were in fact in the main dining room, 
with the supporting cast of technicians and experts in an adjacent 
tent. ``It has a little of the flavor of a legislative session drawing 
to a close,'' he said, and quickly warned reporters, ``Don't overinterpret 
that.'' In fact, Rubin's repeated references to the main actors as 
``the president,'' ``the king,'' ``the prime minister,'' or ``the 
chairman,'' all moving in and out of ``the Tent,'' evoked the image 
of a Mideastern court or bazaar more than a congressional cloakroom. 
Furthermore, the picture of Arabs, Israelis and Americans wandering 
two by two among the oaks and sycamores or gazing out serenely over 
the Wye River as they pondered how best to bring peace to their peoples 
was charming, but not entirely convincing. Leaks from the ``plantation,'' 
as the conference center was more commonly referred to, offered a 
somewhat different account of how the delegates spent their time. 
In the first days, when time seemed short, many delegates gravitated 
in their spare time to a nearby outlet mall. Three senior Palestinian 
negotiators, Ahmed Qrei (or Abu Ala), Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and 
Yasser Abed Rabbo, accompanied by American bodyguards, were spotted 
at a men's clothing store. (``Abu'' in Arabic means ``father of,'' 
and both names are pseudonyms adopted by the men in the Palestinian 
underground.) As they prepared to leave, a guard leaned over and quietly 
asked a clerk, ``Now, where can they buy perfume?'' Speaking of Abu 
Ala and Abu Mazen, a Palestinian described an early photo session 
at which Ms. Albright posed with the two senior negotiators, and someone 
suggested that they form a rock group called ``Albright and the Two 
Abus.'' The shopping forays presumably supplied delegates with enough 
clothing for the extended stay, though Rubin himself said he had sent 
home for fresh shirts. Though by all accounts walks were taken _ notably 
when Netanyahu wanted to brief his new foreign minister, Ariel Sharon 
_ delegates said golf carts were the preferred means of cruising around 
the 1,000-plus-acre complex. According to one report, Arafat took 
an extended cruise around the grounds, with American and Palestinian 
bodyguards jogging alongside. There were conflicting reports that 
Arafat made the tour on a bicycle, but these were deemed inherently 
less reliable. Trying hard to supply reporters' hunger for color, 
the trade name for cute tidbits with which to pack the space left 
open by lack of real information, spokesmen doled out reports like 
the one that Clinton had brought his dog ``Buddy'' to the farm and 
had shown him to Arafat. As a rule, dogs are considered unclean beasts 
in Islam, but Arafat was said to have appreciated this particular 
specimen. Then there was Netanyahu's 49th birthday on Wednesday. The 
first to congratulate him was Ms. Albright, who called him at 2:15 
a.m. Though Netanyahu was not yet asleep, he was reportedly taken 
aback, and said, ``Is that really why you called?'' But these images 
of harmony failed to conceal the fact that there was tension galore. 
For one thing, the occasional reports that Arafat and Netanyahu had 
conferred by phone suggested that these two, at least, were not yet 
prepared for regular strolls into the setting sun. After Clinton's 
first meeting with Netanyahu a week ago, one official overheard the 
president say to an aide: ``Might as well watch the World Series. 
This isn't going anywhere fast'' _ or words to that effect. There 
was also some grousing about the food. Though Rubin described a mouth-watering 
menu including rack of lamb, rockfish, and mango ice, Israelis who 
did not want to be named reported that it was not that tasty. Nobody 
suggested, however, that this was another American gambit to push 
the participants to agreement. Chesapeake College, a community college 
a couple of miles from the plantation where reporters kept vigil, 
also seemed to be getting a bit weary of the television vans parked 
on their lawns and the reporters occupying their theater. A sign reading 
``Welcome to the International Press'' on the front field went down 
after a few days, and officials said several events planned for the 
theater, which Rubin used for his briefings, had to be rescheduled. 
But Murray K. Hoy, the executive vice president of the college, gamely 
insisted said that the experience was ``very interesting'' for the 
student body. ``To host the international press was certainly the 
responsible thing to do,'' he said gamely, noting that the students 
went out and bought cookies, apples, soda and fruit for the reporters 
when they first arrived.
