Underlining how times have changed, the British are laying on a lavish 
welcome for Carlos Menem, the first Argentine president to visit since 
Argentina and Britain went to war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands. 
Trade is booming, a reconciliation service is planned at St. Paul's 
Cathedral and _ something really different _ Britain's sole Latin 
American ally in the Falklands War, former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet, is under arrest in a London clinic. Not quite everything 
has changed, though. Margaret Thatcher, who as Conservative Party 
prime minister dispatched the British fleet 8,000 miles (12,900 kms) 
to recapture the wind-swept archipelago in the south Atlantic, won't 
be at the reconciliation service. She has a longstanding previous 
engagement out of the country, her office says. And the widow of Lt. 
Col. Herbert Jones, the daredevil paratroop commander killed at Goose 
Green _ a pivotal land battle in which British troops who were outnumbered 
2-to-1 captured 1,400 Argentine soldiers _ has also said she is too 
busy to come to the service. It takes place Oct. 28, the first full 
day of a five-day visit in which Menem will lay a wreath for the 970 
people killed _ 255 of them British soldiers. Prince Andrew, Queen 
Elizabeth II's son who flew combat missions as a helicopter pilot 
during the 74-day war, will be there, along with Labor Party government 
officials, veterans' organizations and representatives of families 
of slain British and Argentine soldiers. Prime Minister Tony Blair's 
spokesman said Thursday that Menem's visit will not be overshadowed 
by either the Falklands or the presence nearby of 82-year-old Pinochet, 
under armed guard at a clinic in London's West End. British police 
arrested Pinochet, who was on an announced visit, Oct. 16 at the instigation 
of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of murder, 
genocide and torture of victims killed during his 17-year rule. Linking 
the Menem visit and the Pinochet arrest, Lady Thatcher said Thursday 
in a letter to the Times of London that it would be ``disgraceful 
to preach reconciliation with one, while maintaining under arrest 
someone who, during that same conflict, did so much to save so many 
British lives.'' Blair's government rejected her demand for Pinochet's 
immediate release, calling the arrest a legal, not political, issue, 
and objecting to the link. ``President Menem is simply not General 
Galtieri,'' Blair's press secretary said, referring to Leopoldo Galtieri, 
the military dictator who invaded the Falklands. The visit _ despite 
the continuing dispute over the sovereignty of the Falklands _ reflected 
the ``maturity'' of Argentina's democratically elected government, 
added Blair's spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
Representatives of the 2,200 British-descended islanders also will 
not be taking part in any of the ceremonies. ``We are happy for the 
trip to take place because it strengthens the relationship between 
Argentina and the United Kingdom and therefore makes our position 
more secure,'' said Suki Cameron, spokeswoman for the Falkland Island 
office in London. ``But we regard it as purely a matter between the 
governments.'' Unlike the Pinochet arrest, the impending Menem visit 
has received scant publicity in Britain. Before 1982, many Britons 
were unaware the remote British colony existed, and the issue has, 
for most, long since faded.
