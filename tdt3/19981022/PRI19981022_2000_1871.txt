Truck engine manufacturers will spend hundreds of millions of dollars 
to settle federal charges that they have violated clean air regulations. 
NPR's Dan Charles reports. The government claims that the manufacturers 
of diesel engines for trucks set those engines to pass federal emissions 
tests in the laboratory but not while driving on the open road. When 
cruising on highways, the engines were set to maximize fuel economy, 
burning a so-called lean mixture of fuel and air. That causes a drastic 
increase in emissions of chemical compounds that turn into smog. Seven 
engine companies will pay $83 million in fines. They'll spend hundreds 
of millions more developing cleaner engines and rebuilding old ones 
when they come in for major overhauls. That usually happens about 
every three years. Engine builders also will have to meet even tougher 
emission standards by the end of the year 2002. Truckers said the 
settlement would raise their operating costs. Environmentalists called 
it long overdue. Dan Charles, NPR News, Washington.
