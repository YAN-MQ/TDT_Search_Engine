Germany's new leader isn't going to a World War I Armistice Day ceremony 
in France because of scheduling problems, not because he wants to 
avoid the past, his spokesman said Thursday. Chancellor-elect Gerhard 
Schroeder informed French President Jacques Chirac ``in all friendliness'' 
that he could not attend the Nov. 8 ceremony because his calendar 
was already full, said spokesman Michael Juerdens. ``He's in the middle 
of the very difficult process of assuming office,'' Juerdens said. 
Schroeder and his new Cabinet are to be sworn in Oct. 27. Juerdens 
dismissed as ``rubbish'' and ``simply nonsense'' reports from Paris 
that quoted a French official as saying Schroeder turned down the 
invitation because he wanted ``a new face'' for Germany that wasn't 
tied to the past. But his failure to attend is likely to be perceived 
as a serious snub in France. While France and Germany have worked 
together to build a united Europe, fears of German economic domination 
still haunt France. About 3.2 million French and German soldiers were 
among the 10 million killed during World War I, which ended with a 
truce on Nov. 11, 1918. Schroeder already has made trips to Paris 
and Washington since the Sept. 27 elections, and Juerdens said he 
will visit Moscow on Nov. 16-17 to meet with President Boris Yeltsin. 
``No topics in a broad sense have been established yet,'' he said. 
Schroeder also will attend an informal European Union summit in Austria 
on Saturday, and his first trip as chancellor is scheduled Nov. 2 
to London.
