Law enforcement officials say Los Angeles has some 1,000 car chases 
a year. Now, authorities have a way to deflate even the most determined 
suspect's escape plan. Susan Reed reports. O.J. Simpson's slow-speed 
freeway chase was the first time most people heard of the phenomena. 
But for those living in Los Angeles, police pursuits are a regular 
spectator sport. We probably lead the nation in the number of pursuits, 
the severity of them and the potential for crashes. With over 1,000 
pursuits a year, plain vanilla car chases are rather passe. What really 
gets people's attention now is the man who held his infant child hostage 
as he ran for the Mexican border, or the Van loaded with explosives 
that crashed into a police vehicle. Or the guy who stole a seven-up 
truck and plowed through red lights in the san Fernando valley. For 
L.A. sheriff's deputies who have to stop the fleeing vehicles, this 
isn't funny. They're saying enough is enough. They've purchased state 
of the art remote control road spikes sheriff's deputies carry around 
in their cars. Instead of damaging other vehicles, they are raised 
to hit a single car. Even at high speeds, there are no blowouts. There 
is no loss of control. And actually, the tires just go to mush over 
a period of 40-50 seconds. I felt like I had to slow down because 
I didn't have the steering ability. Sheriffs deputies hope the spikes 
will save the lives of innocent bystanders threatened by fleeing criminals. 
They range from bank robbers and murderers to people who, believe 
it or not, have expired driver's licenses. Most people who run are 
facing a third-strike conviction. They have nothing to loose, because 
in California they're facing life in prison. Susan Reed, CNN, Pomona, 
California.
