Even George Steinbrenner, who likes to brag about his baseball team, 
was not ready to say outright that the 1998 Yankees are the best ever, 
even after they completed their stunning 125-victory season with a 
World Series sweep of the San Diego Padres on Wednesday night. ``I 
won't say anything about us being the greatest,'' Steinbrenner, wet 
from Champagne, said. ``But there hasn't been anybody better.'' Perhaps 
Steinbrenner was being a little cautious because he was aware that 
there is no easy way to assign the 1998 Yankees their rightful place 
in history. Baseball's rules have essentially remained the same during 
the course of the 20th century, but the sport has evolved. Players 
are bigger and stronger and faster, and 51 years ago, baseball's segregation 
ended. Multiple expansions may have diluted the quality of players 
_ particularly the pitching _ but at the same time, the worldwide 
talent pool has mushroomed over the last two decades. The World Series 
used to be the only post-season drama in baseball, but now a team 
has to survive two rounds of playoffs just to get there. Still, if 
a basic standard for being the greatest is winning baseball games, 
than perhaps the 1998 Yankees are the best ever, for they won 125 
games, nine more than any other team that has won the World Series. 
And if another basic standard for being the best is dominating the 
competition _ something that can be measured statistically _ then 
the 1998 Yankees clearly are the greatest. By winning this year's 
World Series, the Yankees certainly validated their 114 victories 
in the regular season. ``The thing that concerned me the most,'' said 
Yankees Manager Joe Torre, ``was not winning the World Series and 
having someone look down their nose at what we accomplished this year.'' 
Many great teams did not win the World Series, did not survive their 
ultimate test of greatness: the 1906 Chicago Cubs won a record 116 
games during the regular season and then lost to the Chicago White 
Sox in the World Series; the 1954 Cleveland Indians won 111 games 
during the season only to be swept by the New York Giants; the 1969 
Orioles, with 109 regular-season victories, lost to the upstart Mets. 
Before this year's playoffs began on Sept. 29, Bob Feller, a pitcher 
with the 1954 Indians, said the 1998 Yankees could never be called 
a great team until they won the World Series; Reggie Jackson said 
the same thing this summer, on a visit to Yankee Stadium. Now that 
they have won, they have leapfrogged beyond the likes of the 1906 
Cubs, the 1954 Indians and the 1969 Orioles, to be compared with those 
teams that did win it all. The 1927 Yankees have been regarded as 
one of the greatest teams ever, and perhaps the best. They won 110 
games during the regular season and swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in 
the World Series; their winning percentage of .722 in the regular 
season and post-season combined is the best ever. They had the game's 
biggest star, Babe Ruth, who hit 60 home runs that season, more than 
every other American League team. First baseman Lou Gehrig, just 24 
years old, hit 47 home runs and drove in 175 runs. Second baseman 
Tony Lazzeri drove in 102 runs, outfielder Bob Meusel drove in 103. 
The Yankees batted .307 and scored 6.3 runs a game. The pitcher Herb 
Pennock, who would be inducted into the Hall of Fame, won 19 games, 
and Waite Hoyt won 22. The Chicago American Giants won the Negro National 
League that year, with a record of 56-29. They did not play the Yankees, 
none of the great Negro League players, such as Oscar Charleston, 
played the Yankees; no team with black or Hispanic players played 
the Yankees. Major League Baseball was not open to non-whites until 
1947, Jackie Robinson's rookie year with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and 
the obliteration of the color barrier had an immediate and dramatic 
impact on the caliber of baseball being played. Imagine the roll call 
of players who would not be a part of the 1998 Yankees if the color 
barrier still existed: Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, 
Jorge Posada, Orlando Hernandez, Hideki Irabu, Ramiro Mendoza, Chili 
Davis, Tim Raines, Darryl Strawberry, Homer Bush, Ricky Ledee and 
perhaps Tino Martinez, a player of Latin descent who looks white. 
Their absence obviously would affect the majesty of the 1998 Yankees, 
or for that matter, any league. Could the 1927 Yankees be considered 
the greatest team ever? For that matter, could any team before 1947 
_ the 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates with Honus Wagner, the 1939 Yankees 
with Joe DiMaggio and Bill Dickey, the 1929 Philadelphia Athletics 
with Jimmie Foxx and Al Simmons and Mickey Cochrane? In the context 
of baseball's history taken as a whole, the 1927 Yankees were the 
best of an exclusive club, a team that dominated a members-only tournament. 
So consider this: The 1998 Yankees rank third among the top 10 championship 
teams for total winning percentage, regular season and post-season 
combined. The other nine teams in that category accomplished their 
achievement before the 1947 season. The bottom line, Torre suggested 
last week, is winning games. Among all teams that won World Series 
titles from 1947 to the present, the 1998 Yankees won the most number 
of games in the regular season, 114. They had the best regular-season 
winning percentage (.704) of any team after 1946. They compiled five 
more victories than any other team since Major League Baseball shifted 
from the 154-game schedule to the 162-game schedule in 1961. There 
have been modern dynasties that demonstrated their greatness in the 
World Series: the Oakland Athletics won three consecutive titles from 
1972-74, and yet the most victories they compiled in any of those 
regular seasons was 94 _ or 20 fewer than the 1998 Yankees. The 1989 
Athletics were a dominant team that won 99 games, or 15 fewer than 
the 1998 Yankees. Joe Morgan, a member of baseball's Hall of Fame 
following his exceptional career with the Cincinnati Reds and others, 
and now a baseball broadcaster, has argued that the Cincinnati teams 
he played on were better than the 1998 Yankees. The 1975 Reds that 
won 108 games and beat the Boston Red Sox in seven games in the World 
Series had more star quality, with the career hit leader Pete Rose, 
catcher Johnny Bench, the two-time most valuable player Morgan and 
the first baseman Tony Perez. They were immortalized as the Big Red 
Machine. But the debate over the best team ever is not based on which 
team had players with better careers; rather, the argument is over 
who had the best team in a given year. Perez batted .282 that year, 
hit 20 home runs and drove in 109 runs; Tino Martinez hit .281 for 
the Yankees this season with 28 home runs and 123 RBI. Bench hit 28 
home runs and drove in 110 runs; Paul O'Neill slugged 24 home runs 
this season and drove in 116. Morgan batted .327 with 17 home runs 
and 94 RBI and won the most valuable player award; the Yankees' Derek 
Jeter batted .324 with 19 home runs and 84 RBI. The third baseman 
Rose hit .317 with 112 runs scored; the Yankees' Brosius hit .300 
with 98 RBI. Morgan has said the Reds could win in many different 
ways, and he is correct. They hit 124 home runs and stole 168 bases. 
The 1998 Yankees stole 153 bases and slugged 207 home runs. The Reds 
ranked first in the National League in runs (840), second in hitting 
(.271) and third in ERA (3.37); the 1998 Yankees ranked first in runs 
(965), second in hitting (.288) and first in ERA (3.82). Fewer runs 
were scored in the Reds' era, and relative to the rest of the league, 
Cincinnati's offense was better. Averaging 5.2 runs a game, they scored 
26 percent higher than the league average; the 1998 Yankees scored 
19 percent higher. But the Yankees' pitching is far and away more 
dominant than the Reds. The cumulative earned run average in the American 
League this year was 4.65, and the Yankees' ERA was 18 percent lower; 
the ERA of the 1975 Reds was just 7 percent lower. The Yankees' roster 
is clearly deeper than that of the Reds. Cincinnati's bench _ those 
players beyond their regular lineup _ contributed 242 hits and 14 
home runs. The Yankees mustered 282 hits and 42 home runs. The bottom 
line is winning. The 1998 Yankees won six more games than the 1975 
Reds in the regular season. The 1998 Yankees went 11-2 in the postseason, 
the 1975 Reds were 7-3. The 1986 Mets won 108 games in the regular 
season and eight more in the post-season, beating Houston in the NL 
playoffs and the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. They had a deep 
roster, graced by the likes of Darryl Strawberry, Keith Hernandez 
and Gary Carter, and excellent pitching. But the 1998 Yankees are 
a far superior defensive team, and again, relative to their peers, 
the Yankees fare better. The Mets scored 15 percent more runs than 
their opponents and their ERA was 16 percent lower. The Yankees: 19 
percent and 18 percent, respectively. And winning is the bottom line. 
The 1998 Yankees won six more games in the regular season than the 
Mets did, and the Mets' cumulative winning percentage is 51 points 
lower than that of the Yankees. The 1970 Baltimore Orioles had perhaps 
the best defensive team ever, with Mark Belanger at shortstop, Brooks 
Robinson at third, Davey Johnson at second. They had star pitchers 
in Jim Palmer and Mike Cuellar. But the Yankees are a better offensive 
team, with more speed and a deeper bullpen. The 1970 Orioles finished 
with 115 victories _ 10 fewer than the 1998 Yankees _ a .676 winning 
percentage nowhere near this year's champion. The 1961 Yankees, loaded 
with power, hit 240 home runs; Mickey Mantle hit 54, Roger Maris 61, 
and the Yankees won 109 games during the regular season before beating 
Cincinnati in five games in the World Series. But in a year when run 
production increased dramatically with the American League's first 
expansion, the Yankees' pitching staff compiled a 4.02 ERA, or 14 
percent better than the rest of the league. They scored 13 percent 
more runs. Add those two figures together for 27 percent, the lowest 
among the five most successful teams since 1946 _ the 1986 Mets (31 
percent), the 1970 Orioles (32 percent), the 1975 Reds (33 percent) 
and the 1998 Yankees (37 percent). Merv Rettenmund, the San Diego 
hitting coach, has been a first-hand witness to some of the best teams, 
playing with the 1970 Orioles and the 1975 Reds, coaching the 1989 
Athletics and in the last week, coaching against the 1998 Yankees. 
Torre's team, Rettenmund said, does not have the offense of the 1975 
Reds, but has better pitching and more depth. The Yankees have more 
offense than the 1970 Orioles, he believes. ``Are the Yankees the 
best ever?'' Rettenmund said aloud. ``I don't know. They're above 
average in every phase of the game. They've got the whole package.'' 
Rettenmund said that if he could pick one team from one year for one 
seven-game series, he would pick the 1989 Athletics, with Jose Canseco 
and Rickey Henderson and Mark McGwire _ a team that won 15 fewer games 
than the Yankees. And yet, there are those Yankee numbers: 114 victories 
in the regular season, 125 in all. ``That's incredible,'' Rettenmund 
agreed. ``That tells you something about the type of team they have. 
That tells you a lot.'' That's the bottom line. The 1998 Yankees, 
the best ever.
