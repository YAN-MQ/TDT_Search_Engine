"You may want to check out the map. King Cove is a long ways away 
from the Alaskan panhandle." Another listener, Y.J. Rosen, pointed 
out that another wayward fact was in our Geography Quiz. He sent us 
an E-mail saying, "Congress did not authorize a road to be built between 
King Cove and Cold Bay through designated wilderness. Congress did 
authorize about $37 million in funds for improved medical services 
in King Cove." Apparently, some of that money was earmarked to help 
create the road, but in a last minute federal budget compromise, the 
plan for the road was abandoned.
