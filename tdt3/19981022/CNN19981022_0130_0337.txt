President Clinton has declared disaster areas in 20 Texas counties. 
Storms and accompanying floods have killed 22 people since Saturday. 
Emergency authorities estimate the damage will top $400 million. In 
Victoria and Cuero, two cities swamped by the guadalupe river, the 
waters slowly are receding. Curfews are being enforced in both towns. 
500 homes in Victoria have been flooded. As we're able to go in with 
the utility people and make sure that the electricity is safe, the 
utilities -- gas, natural gas and other things -- we'll be trying 
to release areas as the water goes down in grids or in sections to 
the citizens to let the citizens know what -- I know they want to 
get back in and see their property, but it's going to be a while yet. 
The national weather service says light rain and drizzle will continue 
to fall over the flooded areas, but no heavy rain is forecast.
