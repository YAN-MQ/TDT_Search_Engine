Up ahead, a Japanese giant stumbles on PRI, Public Radio International. 
There are 91 reasons to support 91 FM. Here's a good one. Hi, my name 
is Fayaza. I live in Wayne. 91 FM is programmed at the number one 
button in my car radio, and I don't even know why I bother to program 
it because it's the only thing I ever listen to in my car. I get "Morning 
Edition," "All Things Considered," Terry Gross, Tony Kahn, "The World." 
I get "The World" with WHYY is what I get and why I enjoy being a 
member. Well, if you're that excited about 91 FM and THE WORLD, then 
why don't you pick up the phone and become a member of this terrific 
public radio service. The number to call is 215-923-1234. Call collect 
if it's long distance. 215-923-1234. Programs like THE WORLD and "All 
Things Considered" and "Talk of the Nation" exist here on this station 
because people like you become members of WHYY and give their financial 
support. The number again is 215-923-1234.
