HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _Soldiers, armored personnel carriers and artillery 
pieces left Harare on Thursday, apparently headed for Congo for a 
promised new offensive against Congolese rebels. U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's special envoy to the region called for restraint and more 
impetus for peace talks. ``We are anxious to get a cease fire in place...we 
do not want to see the situation there get out of control,'' said 
the envoy, Howard Wolpe, after meeting Zimbabwe's President Robert 
Mugabe on Thursday. Congo President Laurent Kabila's allies _ Angola, 
Namibia and Zimbabwe _ agreed Wednesday to attack the rebels in their 
jungle stronghold in eastern Congo. Rwanda and Uganda reportedly back 
the rebels. The proposed offensive represents a major escalation in 
the conflict threatening the Great Lakes Region. Until now, Kabila's 
allies have been defending the government in the western Congo, where 
rebels started their drive against Kabila in August. Civilian hospital 
officials in Harare reported being asked to assist in an inoculation 
program for soldiers believed destined for the steamy, insect-infested 
jungles. Coming rains are expected to close many roads and hamper 
the allies' advantage of air support. Harare-based defense analyst 
Michael Quintana said the allied troops will be hampered by longer 
supply lines than the rebels, who are close to their bases in the 
vast mineral rich country. ``The rebels ... are likely to roll with 
the allied punch, bide their time and then come back with a sting,'' 
he said. Quintana said allied reinforcements would be needed to hold 
Kinshasa and other government-controlled areas as the offensive proceeds 
toward rebel-held territory. Residents on the main route to Harare's 
Manyame military air base reported seeing convoys of troops, munitions, 
armored cars and trucks towing artillery headed toward the base Thursday. 
Military transport airplanes were seen taking off, witnesses said. 
There was no official word on how many reinforcements were on their 
way to join about 3,000 Zimbabwean troops already in the Congo. ``We 
are working in line with what the heads of government decided yesterday,'' 
said Col. Chancellor Diye, spokesman for the Zimbabwe National Army. 
He would not elaborate. Namibia now has between 600 to 1,000 troops 
in Congo, according to past media reports. Angola has about 1,000 
troops. The number of troops to be added in the new offensive was 
not known. Rwandan Vice President Gen. Paul Kagame, meanwhile, met 
with South African President Nelson Mandela on Thursday in Pretoria, 
South Africa's capital. Mandela has been trying to broker a peace 
accord for Congo. No details about the discussions would be released 
to the media, said Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana.
