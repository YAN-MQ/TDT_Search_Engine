The two-time Major League soccer champion D.C. United club has beaten 
the Columbus Crew 3 to 0 to earn a berth in Sunday's MLS Cup and a 
shot at its third straight title. VOA's David Bird was at RFK Stadium 
and has details of the match. In front of 21,453 fans, the United 
took the lead in the 12th minute on a goal from Jeff Agus off a direct 
kick from Marco Echeverry. Then in the 44th minute, Roy Lassiter scored 
his third goal in the playoffs to put D.C. ahead 2 to 0. Lassiter 
added another goal in the 79th minute to put D.C. United ahead 3-0. 
The United had won the first game of this best-of-three-game series 
2 to 0 here at RFK. Columbus evened the series with one game apiece, 
a 4-2 win in a driving rain on a narrow field in Ohio last Sunday. 
But tonight's result put the United into the MLS Cup for the third 
year. They will take on the expansion Chicago Fire October 25 at the 
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. From RFK Stadium, I've Dave Bird,
