The U.S. warns of trade retaliation against Europe today. This time, 
the issue: banana imports. I'm Patrick O'Connell at the business desk 
in New York. America's banana firms have been fighting the European 
unions' import policy since 1992 when regulations were changed which 
they believe put them at a disadvantage. The concerns were taken to 
the World Trade Organization which ruled against Europe but has since 
taken no action to enforce its ruling. Now with the final deadline 
approaching, the U.S. is concerned that new arrangements suggested 
by the European union will be as discriminatory as the first. It threatened 
to take unilateral trade retaliation, a threat which Chris White, 
trade expert from "Euro Fruit" magazine in London thinks should be 
taken seriously. The U.S. sees the question of trade retaliation very 
much a test case. Bananas isn't the only one. Beef Foreman is another 
instance where they really want to test whether the WTO, the World 
Trade Organization Settlements Body has in fact any teeth or not. 
If the WTO doesn't settle it, you know, then it begs the question: 
Well, what is the WTO really for. And I think therefore, the ramifications 
of this dispute on bananas and in fact, on the dispute on beef, and 
there are others, are really pretty enormous.
