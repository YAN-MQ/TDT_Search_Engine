They were cast with their shirts off and that's how fame came to the 
ANSKY boys, five screwy characters with large letters painted on their 
fleshy chests who embody the passion of Yankee fans in commercials 
for Adidas America. Now, thanks to national television exposure during 
the Yankees' World Series sweep, the quintet of shirtless wonders 
are nearly as famous for their stripped-to-the-waist fanaticism as 
Scott Brosius is for his hitting heroics. ``They're hot, they make 
people laugh,'' said Brandon Steiner, a Manhattan sports marketer. 
``The guys are unusual-looking. New Yorkers think they live in the 
capital of unusual-type people. And that's the nerve they tapped into.'' 
Scott Wild, the campaign's copywriter for the Leagas Delaney advertising 
agency, remembered the casting call. Any actors unwilling to doff 
their shirts were eliminated from consideration. ``It was big, meaty 
and sweaty,'' Wild said. ``We probably saw 80 fleshy bodies. Mr. S 
is especially hairy.'' Wild recalled the day last year when the five 
actors taped their most famous spot, climbing over each other in the 
back seat of a crowded taxicab to change their misconfigured human 
anagram from A-N-S-K-Y to Y-A-N-K-S. ``It was the hottest day of the 
year,'' Wild said. ``One thing you don't hear is one guy saying, `Is 
that a puddle of sweat?' The nice thing is they got along. Most people 
wouldn't want to touch themselves the way they did.'' Why ANSKY? Why 
not SANKY? Or SNAKY? NASKY? ``We mixed it up so the five of them would 
have the most difficulty moving around,'' said Peter Nicholson, the 
campaign's art director. ``And it was the funniest anagram, it made 
them do the most twisting around in the cab.'' The commercials are 
the most visible element of a controversial 10-year, $95 million Adidas 
sponsorship that George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, 
signed in 1997. The Yankees disputed Major League Baseball's contention 
that the deal violated its rules and sued all other teams in federal 
court. Eventually, the suit was settled. The first advertising spots 
last season excluded using any Yankees because of the litigation. 
But once it was settled, Adidas drafted pitchers David Cone and Hideki 
Irabu. Irabu's spot ends with skinny Mr. K being hung by his ANSKY 
mates beside a series of strikeout K placards at Yankee Stadium. ``I 
don't want to be the K anymore,'' Mr. K complained, pathetically. 
In Cone's spot, he is cautioned by Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach, 
to rest his arm. The ANSKY's hold his cell phone, feed him, sign his 
autographs and provide unspecified assistance in the men's room. The 
commercials don't sell specifically shoes, apparel or anything else 
Adidas manufactures. The campaign is a bonding experience for the 
Yankee and Adidas names, one that may be more lucrative, at least 
for the Yankees, than the neurotic link between George Costanza and 
George Steinbrenner. Harry Cocciolo, the agency's creative director, 
added: ``It was a recognition that there's a uniqueness to the Yankees, 
that they're legendary. It's a shared acknowledgment of a partnership 
and shared values.'' The spots are so removed from selling products 
that they could be mistaken for a pure Yankee campaign. But recognizing 
the spots' appeal, Adidas is selling T-shirts with the key line from 
the ads: ``What the hell is ANSKY?'' ``We've even seen some bootleg 
copies being sold,'' said Travis Gonzolez, an Adidas spokesman. ``Some 
national retailers are very high on them.'' The campaign may have 
started in 1997, but it achieved its most notice this season, as the 
Yankees rolled to their 24th World Series title. Until the playoffs, 
Adidas paid to run the spots only in the New York market. But the 
campaign was seen nationally since the division series. A 30-second 
World Series spot on Fox cost about $250,000. ``We expected a reaction, 
but not this much,'' Gonzolez said. ``When the Yankees played Cleveland, 
we got calls from Cleveland fans wanting us to do this for the Indians. 
People are getting jealous the Yankees have these fans.'' During a 
visit by Messrs. Y, A, N, K and S to Yankee Stadium last Saturday 
for Game 1 of the World Series, the shirtless superfans were besieged 
by fully clothed fans seeking their autographs (which they ink with 
their initials). ``We caused a riot,'' Gonzolez said. Once seated 
in the upper deck, the ANSKY boys spied another shirtless group carrying 
a stuffed Mr. K mannequin. They are expected to return in new commercials 
next season, Gonzolez said, and may co-star with the other Yankees 
who wear Adidas shoes, including Orlando Hernandez, Ricky Ledee, Shane 
Spencer and Ramiro Mendoza. Next time, maybe the Yankees will go shirtless.
