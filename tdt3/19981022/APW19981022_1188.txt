Chelsea's Marcel Desailly scored three minutes into second-half injury 
time on a shot from 18 meters (yards) that went in off the upright 
to salvage a 1-1 draw against FC Copenhagen Thursday in the second 
round, first leg of the Cup Winners Cup. In the 81st minute, Bjarne 
Goldbaek appeared to get the winner for the Danes when he scored on 
an 18-meter (yard) shot. Goldbaek hammered in the goal after Chelsea's 
Dennis Wise failed to control the ball as it was cut back near the 
end line. Chelsea, despite a wide margin of play _ particularly in 
the second half _ now faces a difficult game in two weeks in Copenhagen 
in the second leg. The English side, stocked with a high-priced talent 
from a dozen countries, carried much of the play _ hit the post twice 
_ but failed to break down a well-organized Danish defense. FC Copenhagen 
had the best chance to score early when David Nielsen missed an open 
net from just six meters (yards) in the 23rd minute. Chelsea's Gianfranco 
Zola came back 10 minutes later with a shot off the goal upright and 
Denmark's Brian Laudrup also shot wide late in the half from a sharp 
angle. Chelsea, on a windy, rainy night, pressured in the first 10 
minutes of the second half, the best chance coming as Pierluigi Casirahgi 
hit the upright in the 55th minute from eight meters (yards). Chelsea 
remains unbeaten in all European competition at home. The English 
side also is now unbeaten in 11 games this season and is trying to 
become the first team to win the Cup Winners Cup in back-to-back seasons 
_ and the last. This cup disappears next season as it's merged with 
the UEFA Cup.
