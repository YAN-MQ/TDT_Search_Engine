China expressed outrage Thursday over a meeting between India's prime 
minister and the Dalai Lama, saying Delhi violated commitments to 
limit the exiled Tibetan leader's activities. Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Tang Guoqiang, reiterating China's criticisms of the Dalai Lama, said 
the Buddhist leader has ``long engaged in activities to split the 
motherland and undermine national harmony.'' Worried about separatism 
in Tibet, China has put pressure on Delhi over the Dalai Lama ever 
since he fled to India amid an abortive uprising against Chinese rule 
in Tibet in 1959. He remains popular among Tibet's fervently Buddhist 
people despite decades of religious repression by China's rulers and 
recent campaigns to ban his photographs and discredit him. The Dalai 
Lama, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, met Prime Minister 
Atal Bihari Vajpayee earlier this month, their first meeting since 
Vajpayee became prime minister in March. No announcements followed 
the meeting and the Indian Foreign Office and a Dalai Lama aide refused 
to divulge details. ``It's nothing unusual. He meets all the prime 
ministers,'' said Tenpa Tsering, a spokesman for the Dalai Lama. Still 
Beijing objected, as it often does to any forums that seem to confer 
legitimacy on the Dalai Lama. ``The meeting by the prime minister 
of India with Dalai violated the commitment by the Indian side of 
not allowing the Dalai to engage in anti-China political activities 
in India,'' Tang said at a routine media briefing. He added that the 
meeting ``interfered in the internal affairs of China and hurt the 
feelings of the Chinese people. The Chinese side hereby expresses 
its deep resentment and regret over this.''
