Felix Magath was hired and Wolfgang Sidka fired Thursday as coach 
of Werder Bremen, the Bundesliga's last-place club that was a league 
powerhouse until three years ago. Magath, a 45-year-old former German 
World Cup player, was signed until June 30, 2000 and will be on the 
bench Friday against Hamburger SV, a club he once coached. Sidka's 
release had been widely expected because of the club's desolate Bundesliga 
performances, and came despite a well-played 1-1 draw against Olympique 
Marseille Tuesday in the UEFA Cup. Magath, known as a strict disciplinarian, 
is expected to receive far-reaching authority to run the club, with 
management hoping he can reverse the slide of a team that was the 
Bundesliga's best in the early 1990s. ``Bremen is one of the most 
solid best-run clubs in the league,'' said Magath. ``I see rosy times 
approaching.'' Sidka, who held the job since September of last year, 
is the third coach in as many years for the troubled club, whose problems 
began after Otto Rehhagel resigned in 1995. Rehhagel, now FC Kaiserslautern 
coach, was a towering presence at Werder Bremen. He led the regional 
club up from the second division to several Bundesliga titles and 
a regular presence in international competition during his 14-year-stint. 
Magath, a player on Germany's 1982 and 1986 World Cup runner-up teams, 
carried Hamburg into the UEFA Cup during his two years with the Bundesliga 
club. He gained Bundesliga promotion with FC Nuremberg last year, 
but resigned as coach after a squabble with the club president.
