Lawyers for former Chilean Dictator Augusto Pinochet have launched 
a legal challenge to his arrest in Britain. They want a court to decide 
if there is enough evidence to hold their client. The 82-year old 
general was arrested at the request of Spanish judges last week as 
he recuperated from surgery at a London clinic. Human rights groups 
say he should face justice for abuses during his regime.
