Time now to talk politics. Port Alexander, Alaska has about 100 residents 
and it appears none of them wants to be mayor for very long. Port 
Alexander is a remote fishing town where people give high priority 
to their jobs and to their families. Earlier this year, the mayor 
stepped down so she could spend some more of her time earning money 
for house payments. Since then, the seven members of the Port Alexander 
Town Council have taken turns as mayor one month at a time. This month, 
the mayor is Laura Rydell. Mayor Rydell admits that the rotating mayor 
system is not the best way to manage the town. But so far, things 
have been rather stable. Political philosophies of the different mayors 
have not varied all that much. Mayor Rydell says Port Alexander is 
such a small town that there's much room for anyone to have a private 
agenda. I like that form of democracy-- a rotating mayor every month. 
That's not such a bad idea. It would be interesting for the presidency, 
wouldn't it?
