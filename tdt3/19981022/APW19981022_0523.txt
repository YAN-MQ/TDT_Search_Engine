After months of talks, Hong Kong will open the territory's international 
direct dial telephone market to competition, officials said Thursday. 
Beginning in January, an ``unlimited number of operators'' can try 
to sell long-distance services to telephone users in the territory, 
said K.C. Wong, secretary for information technology and broadcasting. 
Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., which formerly held a monopoly 
over the services, recently agreed to surrender its lock on the market 
for 6.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 858 million) in compensation. 
Any new operators will use infrastructure set up by Hong Kong Telecom.
