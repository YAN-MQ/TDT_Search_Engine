Soldiers, armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces left Harare 
on Thursday, apparently headed for Congo for a promised new offensive 
against Congolese rebels. Congo President Laurent Kabila's allies 
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe agreed Wednesday to attack the rebels 
in their stronghold _ the dense jungles of eastern Congo. Rwanda and 
Uganda reportedly back the rebels. Civilian hospital officials in 
Harare reported being asked to assist in an inoculation program over 
coming days for soldiers believed destined for the steamy, insect-infested 
jungles. Coming rains are expected to close many roads and hamper 
the allies' advantage of air support. The announcement of the offensive 
is expected to lead to a major escalation of the conflict that began 
on Aug. 2 when rebels started their drive to topple Kabila. Harare-based 
defense analyst Michael Quintana said the allied troops that fended 
off rebel advances on the western Congolese capital of Kinshasa will 
have to contend with extended supply lines in their offensive. The 
rebels will be closer to their supply bases. ``The rebels ... are 
likely to roll with the allied punch, bide their time and then come 
back with a sting,'' he said. Quintana said allied reinforcements 
would be needed to hold Kinshasa and other government-controlled areas 
as the offensive proceeds toward rebel-held territory. Residents on 
the main route to Harare's Manyame military airbase reported seeing 
convoys of troops, munitions, armored cars and trucks towing artillery 
headed toward the base Thursday. Military transport airplanes were 
seen taking off, witnesses said. There was no official word on how 
many reinforcements were on their way to join about 3,000 troops already 
in the Congo. ``We are working in line with what the heads of government 
decided yesterday,'' said Col. Chancellor Diye, spokesman for the 
Zimbabwe National Army. He would not elaborate. Rwandan Vice President 
Gen. Paul Kagame, meanwhile, met with South African President Nelson 
Mandela on Thursday in Pretoria, South Africa's capital. Mandela has 
been trying to broker a peace accord for Congo. No details about the 
discussions would be released to the media, said Mandela's spokesman, 
Parks Mankahlana.
