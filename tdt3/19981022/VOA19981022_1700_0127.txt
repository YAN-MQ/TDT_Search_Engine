Rebels in Congo Kensasha say they are fighting government forces around 
the diamond rich city of Abugimai which provides vast wealth to government 
coffers. Rebel radio says President Laret Kabeila has deployed 7000 
Hutu miltian man, 10 jet fighters, and three helicopters to defend 
the city which is 700 kilometers east of Kensasha. There's no independent 
confirmation of the rebel radio report.
