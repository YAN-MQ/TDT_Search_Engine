Other news this evening -- a new study is sending a wake-up call. 
It shows 56% of women in the United States lack adequate sleep. And 
according to the research, female health issues are the cause. 79% 
of those surveyed say their sleep is disturbed by pregnancy. 71% have 
problems because of their menstrual cycle. And 56% of the women studied 
say menopause disturbs their sleep. The national sleep foundation
