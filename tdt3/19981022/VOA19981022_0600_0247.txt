Officials say the death toll in the weekend gasoline pipeline explosion 
in southern Nigeria may reach 1,000. Some of those injured in the 
fire aren't leaving hospitals because they fear they may be arrested 
for theft of gasoline. Pipeline company officials blame the disaster 
on a growing pattern of vandalizing pipelines for theft.
