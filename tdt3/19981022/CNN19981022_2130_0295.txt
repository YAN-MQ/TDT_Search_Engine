The national church arson task force says there is no evidence of 
a National conspiracy to burn houses of worship. The task force was 
created because of the numerous highly publicized attacks, especially 
on black Churches in the south. Of 670 suspicious church fires, bombings 
or attempted bombings, 225 targeted black Churches. Today's report 
says incidents are declining. 208 suspicious fires were investigated 
last year. This year, 114 such fires were reported through September 
8th.
