North Korea sounded a protest Thursday over the U.S. military in South 
Korea, but joined in day-long talks on the nuts-and-bolts of drafting 
a permanent peace for the Korean peninsula. A U.S. official said after 
morning and afternoon sessions that there is a possibility of a ``significant 
procedural'' agreement on organizing the talks by the time the current 
round ends, tentatively scheduled for Sunday. The delegations from 
the two Koreas, China and the United States have failed in two previous 
rounds _ last March and December _ to overcome the hurdle. Only then 
will they be able to begin talking about a peace treaty to replace 
the armistice that has been in place since the end of the 1950-53 
Korean war. Discussions Thursday were on the proposal of South Korea, 
which is chairing the current round, to form two ``subcommittees'' 
to deal with key issues, officials said. North Korea has demanded 
that the four sides agree on an agenda before they decide how to discuss 
it. But U.S. officials said North Korean delegates participated actively 
with the other sides in the talks Thursday even though they stuck 
to their position. Under the South Korean proposal, one panel would 
discuss replacing the armistice while the other formulates confidence-building 
measures. Officials noted that the atmosphere was good enough for 
all sides to attend an evening reception at the U.S. Mission to United 
Nations offices in Geneva. ``We've made quite a bit of progress in 
narrowing the differences, but the North Korean position remains quite 
firm,'' said U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Charles Kartman. Chinese Ambassador 
Qian Yong-nian said the four sides would continue ``probing.'' To 
underscore its position, North Korea issued a statement on its official 
Korean Central News Agency denouncing U.S. and South Korean plans 
for joint military maneuvers to begin Monday. The exercises have been 
held annually since 1961, but North Korea said the timing the day 
after the current round is to end is ``seriously provoking.'' ``The 
war exercises are patent proof that the United States and the South 
Korean authorities have no interest in discussing'' ensuring peace 
on the Korean peninsula, it said. Park Kun-woo, leader of the South 
Korean delegation, said, ``We had a constructive meeting, and I underline 
the word `constructive.'' He gave no details. His North Korean counterpart, 
Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan, declined to comment. Chinese Ambassador 
Qian Yong-nian said the four sides would continue ``probing.'' The 
border between the Koreas is the world's most heavily armed, with 
nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides. A technical state 
of war has continued since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice 
instead of a peace treaty. The United States and China were the other 
main combatants in the war.
