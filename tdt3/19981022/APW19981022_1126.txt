The U.N. Security Council called for an immediate end to military 
offensives in the Congo Thursday as forces from three southern African 
nations prepared to attack rebels in the country's eastern jungles. 
Allies of embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila _ Namibia, 
Zimbabwe and Angola _ decided Wednesday to help him oust rebel forces 
entrenched in the eastern Congo. Forces from the three nations have 
been concentrated in western Congo, where they fended off a rebel 
advance in August. After a briefing from Undersecretary General Sir 
Kieran Prendergast, the Security Council called for all troops in 
the country to remain where they are and stop fighting. Council members 
also ``urged all parties involved not to take action which would lead 
to escalation of the conflict'' and to respect the Congo's territorial 
integrity, said British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the council's 
current president. The Congolese rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted 
members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ accuse Kabila 
of corruption, mismanagement and promoting tribalism. Kabila says 
the rebels are puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, his erstwhile allies 
who installed him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month war against 
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. The Security Council expressed support 
for efforts by the Organization of African Unity and regional organizations 
to arrange a ceasefire and welcomed a meeting in the Zambian capital, 
Lusaka, on Oct. 26 of foreign and defense ministers from a number 
of countries to try to resolve the crisis. Council members urged all 
parties involved in the Congo conflict to attend the talks ``and to 
use this major opportunity in a spirit of realism and compromise to 
help bring a destructive cycle of violence in the region to an end,'' 
Greenstock said. Once the results of the Lusaka meeting are known, 
the council said it intends to discuss the Congo again ``and, if necessary, 
to consider urgently what further role the U.N. might play in encouraging 
a peaceful and lasting settlement,'' Greenstock said.
