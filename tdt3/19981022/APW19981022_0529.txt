Sugar cane acreage is up in Vietnam, but production is expected to 
be roughly the same as last year due to serious drought earlier this 
year, an Agriculture Ministry official said Thursday. The official 
declined to detail financial damage from the drought, but the newspaper 
Investment estimated it at about 300 billion dong (dlrs 21.4 million). 
He said the total area under sugar cane cultivation this year rose 
to 270,000 hectares (667,000 acres) from 250,000 hectares (618,000 
acres) for the last crop, but the increase barely makes up for the 
drought-related losses. Overall production is estimated at just over 
10 million tons of cane. This will probably worsen the situation of 
excess sugar mill capacity around the country. The mills already face 
chronic shortages of raw sugar cane to process. Vietnam expects to 
put more mills in operation, bringing the number to 41 by the end 
of this year, up from 37 in 1997. Most mills, which produced 330,000 
tons of sugar from the last crop, already are running well below capacity.
