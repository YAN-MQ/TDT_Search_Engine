Darryl Strawberry was watching the Yankees celebrate their World Series 
title on Wednesday night when the telephone rang and he was verbally 
transported from Fort Lee, N.J. to San Diego. It was Derek Jeter and 
some of Strawberry's closest friends on the line. About 24 of them. 
Every time a different teammate squealed into the phone, every time 
the Yankees chanted ``Darryl, Darryl,'' and every time someone mentioned 
his name during a television interview, Strawberry was pulled closer 
to a scene that he missed because of colon-cancer surgery three weeks 
ago. ``It means the world to me being part of what this team was all 
about this season,'' said Strawberry. ``In the playoffs, I got sick. 
But I felt good about what we accomplished. I feel good about my whole 
situation. Being healthy and watching them win last night was one 
of the greatest moments of my life.'' Strawberry was answering the 
phone and feeling lively because he is eating three meals of solid 
food per day and because he is about to receive his third World Series 
ring. The Yanks wanted Strawberry to participate in Friday's ticker-tape 
parade or at least meet up with them afterward at city hall, scenes 
which would have rivaled an airplane hangar for the amount of noise 
yielded. But Strawberry, 36, conceded he is still weak and at first 
thought he would not be be in Manhattan Friday. ``Realistically, from 
a physical standpoint, it could be too much for my body,'' he said 
earlier. ``I've told them that.'' Apparently he changed his mind later 
in the day. Colleen Roche, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's press secretary, 
said Thursday night that Darryl Strawberry might be present at Friday's 
parade or at city hall ceremony. ``We're very hopeful, and the possibility 
looks good,'' she said. Manager Joe Torre called Strawberry a few 
hours before Game 4 on Wednesday and asked him what he was doing. 
So Strawberry replied, ``I'm about to take a nap so I can stay up 
and watch us win.'' Torre laughed at Strawberry's confidence, but 
all of the Yankees were supremely confident. After sweeping the Padres 
in four games and finishing with 125 victories, the Yankees can argue 
that they are the best team in major league history. Strawberry, who 
also was on the 1996 Yankees and the 1986 Mets, cast his vote for 
these Yankees. ``I would have to say we were the greatest team ever,'' 
said Strawberry. ``I heard all the comparisons and I don't know about 
the older teams, but in the last 10, 20 or 30 years no one has won 
125 games. It's not easy to win 100. This team cannot be overlooked.'' 
With Strawberry's number 39 embroidered on their caps and thoughts 
of him in their minds, the Yankees never forgot about him during the 
post-season. Moments after their clubhouse celebration began, David 
Wells gathered the Yankees together and they hoisted bottles of Champagne 
in a toast to Strawberry. Strawberry's name was chanted more frequently 
than Scott Brosius, who was the Most Valuable Player of the series. 
``This is for Darryl,'' said Wells. ``We dedicated it to him. It's 
too bad that he can't be here, but he's in our hearts.'' Chili Davis 
added, ``Darryl Strawberry will always be a part of this ballclub. 
I hope next year he's a part of this ballclub. I love Darryl Strawberry. 
Not just because he's a ball player. He's a great guy. He's like my 
brother.'' Strawberry claimed that he came close, but did not cry 
as he watched the Yankees rejoice on television, but indicated that 
his wife, Charisse, used enough tissues for both of them. ``I followed 
the doctor's orders and tried not to get too emotional about it,'' 
said Strawberry. ``My heart and soul was with that team.'' Strawberry 
will return to his permanent home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. next week 
to begin six months of chemotherapy treatment because the cancer spread 
to one of 36 lymph nodes that were removed from his abdomen in surgery. 
Strawberry said he also needs to be in warmer weather for the walks 
that are part of his recuperation. The fight on the field is over 
for the Yankees, but the fight off the field is still in progress 
for Strawberry. ``I'm all set to go,'' said Strawberry. ``I'm looking 
forward to getting completely healthy again and then getting back 
out there in the middle of another championship next season.''
