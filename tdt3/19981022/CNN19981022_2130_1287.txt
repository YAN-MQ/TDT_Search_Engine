Jerome Jurenovich, "Headline Sports." Now that the baseball season 
is over and hockey's is under way, we will ever see basketball anytime 
soon? That's what the NBA players are asking in Las Vegas as they 
continue to map strategy to counter the owners' lockout. We have to 
protect the foundation of what the players before us have done. This 
thing's not about just us today. We have to protect the past, a lot 
of those guys made great sacrifices for us. But also, we have to protect 
the future.
