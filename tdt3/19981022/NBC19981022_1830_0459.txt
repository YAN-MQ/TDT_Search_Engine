Tonight, terrorism is front and center at the Middle East peace talks 
at that Maryland retreat. President Clinton is pushing hard for a 
breakthrough, and the American CIA could be a surprising new player. 
NBC's Andrea Mitchell. Tom, the talks were supposed to last maybe 
three days. Now they have gone nearly three times as long. Tonight 
the president is meeting with both leaders. Talks officials describe 
as the most intense so far. The president returned to the talks after 
a major breakthrough overnight. Tentative agreement on the biggest 
obstacle to a deal, Israel's demand for more protection against terrorist 
attacks. The hardest decisions, now at last, are on the table. Mr. 
Clinton's Arrival and the first three-way meeting since Monday night, 
signs of real progress after a roller-coaster night. On the phone 
to Arafat and Netanyahu, Jordan's king Hussein pushing for compromise. 
The most important negotiator the kroi director, George Tenet. His 
plan -- CIA officers at listening posts in the field to monitor terrorist 
groups and mediate disputes over arrests of suspected terrorists, 
complaints about border checkpoints, investigations into past terrorist 
acts. It's a very controversial position for the CIA to be in, but 
unfortunately, it's become a necessary one, precisely because trust 
has broken down. Last winter, Arafat met with the CIA director in 
this Virginia hotel. Netanyahu has agreed to trust the CIA as well. 
But today Netanyahu is under fierce pressure from home. Right-wing 
settlers don't want any agreement. To satisfy them he must at least 
win more concessions -- a Palestinian announcement canceling their 
long-standing threat to destroy Israel. Any success tonight will still 
be hard to implement and the toughest issues will not be dealt with 
here. Thanks very much. Andrea Mitchell.
