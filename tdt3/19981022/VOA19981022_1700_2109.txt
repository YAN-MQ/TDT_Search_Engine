Cambodian King Nordan Seminoc has decline requests that he organize 
another summit of the country's top political leaders. The king sent 
a letter to his son, opposition leader Prince Nordan Reneric, saying 
he sees no point in sharing another meeting. The leaders met last 
month, but could not agree on a government coalition.
