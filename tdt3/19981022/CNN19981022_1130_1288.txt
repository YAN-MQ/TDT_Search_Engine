The Yankees ride the broom to a world series title. I'm Anthony Keith 
James and this is "Headline Sports." The Yankees brought down the 
curtain on the greatest season in baseball history with their 24th 
world series crown. Wednesday, the Bronx bombers beating the padres 
3-0, completing a world series sweep. Scott brosius was named the 
series MVP, hitting 471 with two homers and six rbis. It's every player's 
dream to get to the world series and feel like you played, you know, 
you played a part of the team getting there and the team winning. 
So there's certainly some satisfaction in how this has worked out. 
But I also just feel very lucky, I mean, to be in this position. They 
will hold a victory celebration Friday at 11:30. Fidel Castro has 
permitted the family of Hernandez to leave Cuba to attend the festivities.
