The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies has 
issued its annual report on the military capability and defense spending 
of 107 countries. The world survey shows an increase in defense spending 
and the arms trade especially in the Middle East. VOA's Laurie Kessman 
reports. The military balance report this years sees a growing problem 
with how the west is dealing with conflicts that erupt around the 
world. The study says US military resources are being stretched thin 
by deployments in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, and other areas of 
potential conflict. But, the Institute's Director John Chipman says 
the study also shows a new trend towards using the threat of force 
as a diplomatic tool. In the case of Yugoslavia, Mr. Chipman says 
the strategy actually has forced President Slovin Milsovicz to accept 
an international presence in Kosovo, something the Yugoslav president 
had always opposed. Mr. Chipman says the only way to achieve full 
compliance is to include the threat of sending in fully armed ground 
troops. The annual survey also shows that defense spending is on the 
increase, up 12 percent from last year. But, Russia's arms sales have 
dried up largely because of the economic downturn in Asia where most 
of its customers are based. Laurie Kessman, VOA News, London.
