Japan, you're in one of your worst recessions ever, so where are you 
going? How about Disneyland again. The Walt Disney company started 
construction today on a nearly $3 billion ocean-themed park next to 
Tokyo Disneyland. They're calling it Disney sea and hope it will draw 
more than 10 million visitors a year when it opens in 2001. That would 
follow the success of Tokyo Disneyland which had 17 million visitors 
last year, despite Japan's deep recession.
