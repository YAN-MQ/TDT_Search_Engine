North Korea's protest over planned U.S. military exercises with South 
Korea hung over negotiators Thursday as efforts resumed to reach a 
permanent peace treaty for the Korean peninsula. But delegates from 
North and South Korea, China and the United States had little or nothing 
to say to reporters as they began a second day of talks after a break 
of more than six months. Park Kun-woo, leader of the South Korean 
delegation which is chairing the current round, said he was unable 
to go into detail about what the the four sides were discussing. The 
North's official Korean Central News Agency said U.S. and South Korean 
officials were ``seriously provoking'' by scheduling the maneuvers 
to begin the day after the current round of talks ends Sunday. ``The 
war exercises are patent proof that the United States and the South 
Korean authorities have no interest in discussing an issue of ``ensuring 
peace on the Korean peninsula,'' it said. This year's maneuvers will 
be the 37th the two countries have held since 1961. U.S. and South 
Korean officials termed them ``routine and defensive.'' Most of the 
exercises, involving the 650,000-strong South Korean military and 
the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed there, will be held well south of 
the border with the North, U.S. officials have said. Their border 
is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly 2 million troops deployed 
on both sides. North and South Korea have been in a technical state 
of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace 
treaty. The United States and China, the other two parties to the 
talks, were the other main combatants in the war. Diplomats said the 
first round of the talks Wednesday appeared to be making progress, 
but they declined to elaborate. The South's Yonhap news agency reported 
that the negotiators were still bogged down in conflicting stands 
on the agenda and other procedural matters. South Korea has proposed 
forming committees to deal with different issues, but the North has 
demanded that the agenda be arranged first, Yonhap said. Officials 
said North Korea also insists that the United States withdraw its 
troops and reach a peace treaty with Pyongyang, excluding South Korea. 
The United States and South Korea have indicated willingness to discuss 
the troop withdrawal, but the South opposes having it as a formal 
agenda item. Both also have ruled out discussions on a Washington-Pyongyang 
peace treaty. The United States maintains that any Korean peace treaty 
should be signed between the two Koreas. The first two rounds _ last 
December and March _ failed to overcome the procedural differences.
