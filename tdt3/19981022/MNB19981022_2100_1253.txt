yet. The river is expected O crest sometime tomorrow. Still hours 
away, the death toll from the floods now stands at over two dozen.

half a billion dollars so far. More now from NBC's Jim Cummins. This 
is the 1,200 block of milam street in Wharton, Texas, today. It's 
now part of the Colorado liver. Flood waters are up to roof gutters 
in some places. The people of Wharton are just if latest victims of 
runoff from torrential rains that have driven dozens of rivers and 
streams to record levels. Today, the police and national guard are 
using boats, trucks, and horses to rescue hundreds of flood victims. 
This woman is going back in to get clothes and rescue her dog, but 
the water is rising too fast. They can't drive in there. Most of the 
flood victims are eager to be evacuated because those who stay behind 
face a danger of higher water after dark. But there are the usual 
holdouts. Rene Lathan is content to sit on her Porch and watch the 
water rise for now. Still it gets as high as my rubber boots. Then 
I'll get out. Wharton is under a dawn-to-dusk curfew. The business 
district is prepared for high water. The fire chief says the flood 
water is full of raw sewage. It's going to come right back out of 
a manhole. Today the grim recovery of a car and four members of the 
same family in a Creek south of San Antonio, the latest flood fatalities. 
Richard Hartman, his mother, Donna, a sister-in-law, and their baby 
girl were caught in the floods Saturday night. That means at least 
2 of the 26 victims of these floods zied when trapped in their vehicles.

The fire chief in Wharton expects his city will keep taking on water 
from the Colorado river until sometime tonight. Jim Cummins, NBC news,
