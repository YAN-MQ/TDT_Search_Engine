The tattoo parlor in the next block caught fire a half-hour ago, and 
I dropped everything and went to watch the spectacle. We don't get 
a lot of spectacles in Burgville, my hometown. I was composing something 
fancy about the good old Republican Party being taken over by Bible-thumpers 
when the sirens started rending the air. I know: Nobody says ``rending 
the air'' anymore. It's quaint. ``Corny,'' people used to say. Nobody 
says ``corny'' anymore either. This antediluvian language comes out 
of me because of the tattoo-parlor fire, which makes me think of fires 
of long ago. I ought to be thinking of Bible-thumpers destroying the 
good old Republican Party, but why bother? You know all that: Parsons 
Robertson and Falwell luring sappy young Republicans down the sawdust 
trail. Parsons Gingrich, Starr and Hyde trying to dis-elect a fully 
elected president so as to improve the country's moral tone. You know 
all that. ``They must have a death wish,'' I was going to say. In 
a country notorious for loving sin, they are going to throw out a 
whole presidential election because the winner is a sinner? And so 
on. I can't believe I ever meant to write about that, now that I think 
about it here in the wake of the tattoo-parlor blaze. It is dull, 
dull, dull and, also, has been thoroughly chewed over already by every 
cud-chewer in the land. Was it Henry James who said, ``The civilized 
man knows when the cud has been amply chewed''? Probably not. It was 
definitely Peter DeVries, however, who said Henry James ``chewed more 
than he bit off.'' Burgville will miss the tattoo parlor. It was a 
touch of raffishness in a town that's being obliterated under an onslaught 
of ``antique'' shops. I won't explain those quotation marks around 
``antique,'' as it would hurt the feelings of good Burgvillers who 
run them. I'll just say that when a town like Burgville loses its 
only tattoo parlor it's not like New York losing a corner hot-dog 
stand. It is, as they say in learned circles, a quantum loss. The 
bumper sticker on the tattoo artist's car said, ``You Think It, We 
Ink It.'' It's hard to say why that was so much more enjoyable to 
read than ``My Child Is An Honor Student At Egmont Elementary School'' 
or ``Dole For President,'' which are standards of Burgville's bumper-sticker 
literature. Does it seem that the tattoo-parlor fire has unnerved 
me? Perhaps it has. I detest fires. As a police reporter, I once had 
to go to fires and phone stories to the rewrite desk. Do you know 
how little there is to be said about a fire? A fire in which nobody 
is hurt is the hardest story in town because after you've said the 
fire lit the night sky fetchingly, or grotesquely, or whatever, what 
is left to say? If somebody is hurt, it is dreadful to stand there 
and watch. It is horrible, when people are burned, to see the bodies. 
Later I worked the rewrite desk. Do you know how many synonyms there 
are for ``fire''? After ``blaze'' and ``conflagration'' you've exhausted 
the dictionary. Maybe my fire hatred stems from a childhood afternoon 
when my grandmother's henhouse caught fire and spread to an abandoned 
blacksmith shop adjacent to the house. I was age 5 or 6 or 7 and spending 
summer with my grandmother in a village where the women all took an 
afternoon nap, the men having left for work at dawn. As the only person 
awake that summer afternoon, I watched uneasily while the fire got 
a good firm grip on the henhouse. Why did such things have to happen 
to me? Did I dare wake the women? Absolutely not. Not, at any rate, 
until the henhouse was gone and the flames had a good grip on the 
blacksmith shop and were groping for the house. Hesitantly, I woke 
my grandmother, urging her not to be angry with me, but suggesting 
that the house might burn down. The humiliation ensuing from that 
afternoon has haunted my life. Such a timid spirit, I knew, would 
always disqualify me as a leader, a boss, a star, a great killer CEO. 
And it has. The tattoo-parlor conflagration brings that melancholy 
memory back from the depths. So sad. Not as tiresome, though, as a 
sermon on the Republican descent into Puritanism and _ speaking of 
fire _ brimstone.
