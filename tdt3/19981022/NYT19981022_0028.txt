The Earth Liberation Front, a shadowy group that has taken responsibility 
for a series of arson fires in the Northwest, declared in an e-mail 
communique Wednesday that the fires atop Vail mountain on Monday were 
carried out ``on behalf of the lynx.'' ``Putting profits ahead of 
Colorado's wildlife will not be tolerated,'' read the brief statement, 
which was sent electronically to several Colorado news organizations. 
``We will be back if this greedy corporation continues to trespass 
into wild and unroaded areas.'' The seven fires caused about $12 million 
worth of damage to buildings and chair lifts along a 11,200-foot-high 
ridge that overlooks a National Forest area where the Vail ski area 
started clearing trees on Friday as part of a controversial expansion. 
Earlier this year, environmentalists, back country skiers and many 
residents of Eagle County had spoken out at public meetings to block 
Vail's plan to expand into an area seen as potential habitat for the 
reintroduction of the lynx in the Colorado Rockies. Vail, which plans 
to open for skiing on Nov. 6, is the nation's busiest ski area, selling 
1.6 million lift tickets last winter. Addressing the nation's skiers, 
the communique warned: ``For your safety and convenience, we strongly 
advise skiers to choose other destinations until Vail cancels its 
inexcusable plans for expansion.'' Wednesday evening in Vail, the 
Eagle County sheriff's office said after receiving the two-paragraph 
statement by fax: ``Currently investigators are reviewing the origin 
and the content for credibility and will continue its investigation 
using this communique as a source for information.'' Paul Witt, spokesman 
for Vail Resorts, said, ``We are aware of the facts and are letting 
the proper authorities investigate.'' Although the fires here appear 
to be in response to a local dispute, security was tightened this 
week at other ski areas around Colorado, the nation's most popular 
skiing state. Barry Clausen, a Northern California researcher who 
studies terrorist acts claimed by environmental extremists, said Wednesday 
that the Earth Liberation Front has taken credit for most of the arson 
fires linked to environmental protests. He said the language in Wednesday's 
communique ``is almost identical to other letters the ELF has sent 
to other victims of arson fires.'' Over the last two years, Clausen 
said, the Earth Liberation Front has taken credit for five arsons 
against federal government buildings in Oregon and Washington state. 
``We are seeing a decline in small acts of sabotage, against timber 
and mining, and an escalation of large acts of terrorism,'' Clausen 
said from his office in Eureka. Noting that an article criticizing 
Vail's expansion plans appeared in the May-June issue of Earth First 
Journal, Clausen said: ``It's a real pattern. Many times articles 
come out in the Journal. Then, there is sabotage.'' The article, headlined 
``Super Vail ... Super Ugly!'' charged that Vail wanted to ``bring 
the resort lifestyle into some of the last, best old-growth habitat 
for lynx in the southern Rockies.'' But the author, Ben Doon, did 
not advocate violence. Citing legal efforts to stop the expansion, 
Doon urged readers to contact Ancient Forest Rescue, an environmental 
group. In interview in Vail on Tuesday, Jeff Berman, the local representative 
of Ancient Forest Rescue, appeared depressed by the fires, describing 
them as a setback in his battle for public opinion. He asked: ``Does 
this help us? Of course not.'' Wednesday, Theresa Kintz, editor of 
the Earth First Journal, said after reading the communique: ``It is 
entirely possible that it was an ELF action.'' ``Personally, I don't 
have a problem with hitting people like Vail Inc. in their pockets,'' 
said Ms. Kintz, who dedicates a page of news, headlined ``Earth Night,'' 
to sabotage actions claimed by the Earth Liberation Front. ``I don't 
have a problem with seeing their facilities burn down. It's a war.'' 
``Monkey wrenching and eco-sabotage are strategies that some people 
feel are justified in some circumstances,'' she continued, using Earth 
First! jargon for sabotaging machinery. Noting that arson was a new 
step, she added: ``Classic eco-sabotage would be monkey wrenching 
bulldozers.'' In its November 1990 edition, the Earth First Journal 
published a photograph of a bulldozer apparently sabotaged by militants 
opposed to a ski area expansion near Pagosa Springs, Colo., the only 
other recent case of environmental terrorism against a Colorado ski 
area.
