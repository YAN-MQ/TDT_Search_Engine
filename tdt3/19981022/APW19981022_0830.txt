Industry leaders said they were still behind plans for a high-tech, 
super-fast train link from Berlin to Hamburg despite new opposition 
to the project Thursday from a state government. ``The light is green 
for the magnetic-levitation rail,'' said Peter Jablonski, spokesman 
for the Transrapid Planning Group. Partners in the incoming leftist 
government in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, one of five states through 
which the maglev train is to pass, said Thursday they had agreed not 
to offer any state money for the controversial project. But Jablonski 
said that decision would have no effect on the project, which is being 
paid for by the federal government and private companies involved 
in building it _ Thyssen AG, Siemens AG and Adtranz, a joint venture 
of Daimler-Benz and the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group 
ABB. Last weekend, the new center-left federal government also cast 
doubt on the project, saying it would honor contracts signed by the 
outgoing government, but would not pay for any cost overruns. The 
federal railway office estimated last week that the project will probably 
cost up to 2.8 billion marks (dlrs 1.75 billion) more than the 6.1 
billion marks (dlrs 3.8 billion) originally planned. Industry leaders 
say they won't know if there are any cost overruns until final plans 
for the 297 kilometer (185 mile) stretch are approved following public 
hearings. But Thyssen spokesman Werner Bechtel was optimistic, saying: 
``We're sticking to the Transrapid.'' The Transrapid is to reduce 
the time it takes to ride between Germany's two largest cities by 
two-thirds to about an hour. Opponents have challenged the project 
because of its cost and charge the powerful electromagnetic force 
that will drive the train could have adverse health consequences for 
humans and animals. Officials in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania say 
they want more money invested in improving and expanding existing 
rail links.
