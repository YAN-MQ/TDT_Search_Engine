In this country, President again blasted the Republican controlled 
Congress, saying it is leaving town at the end of its session without 
acting on certain domestic issues. Mr. Clinton said partisanship in 
Congress killed healthcare and education proposals and legislation 
to crack down on teen smoking and reform the campaign finance system. 
Speaking at the White House, the president said he hoped the next 
Congress to be chosen in the November elections will approve the proposals.
