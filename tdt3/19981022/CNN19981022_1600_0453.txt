The New York Yankees are world champions, and the big apple is getting 
ready for a big party. After watching the Yankees sweep baseball's 
world series from the San Diego padres, New York mayor Rudy Giuliani 
announced plans for a ticker-tape parade tomorrow. One tribute to 
be presented to the team will be a giant T-shirt being taken around 
the city so fans can sign it.
