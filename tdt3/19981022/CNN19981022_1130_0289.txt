Children are too often the victims of war according to a new United 
Nations report. Statistics show 2 million children have died in the 
last ten years the result of fighting in their Homeland. In the same 
time period, another 6 million children were seriously injured. Currently, 
300,000 children are believed to be a part of government or rebel 
armies. The author of the U.N. report says laws raising the age for 
military recruitment are needed.
