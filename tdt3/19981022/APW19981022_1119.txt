Orlando Hernandez may be reunited with his family in the United States, 
10 months after the New York Yankees pitcher defected from Cuba on 
a raft. Only this time, his relatives will be leaving the island with 
the Cuban government's blessing. Hernandez's mother, two children 
and the mother of the children have been granted permission by Cuba 
to come to the United States, a State Department official said Thursday. 
The State Department said the family, which includes Hernandez's daughters 
Steffi, 2, and Yahumara, 7, would return to Cuba after a brief visit. 
Hernandez helped lead the Yankees to a 9-3 victory Sunday in Game 
2 of the World Series, which New York won in a sweep of San Diego 
on Thursday night. The Fox News Channel first reported that ``El Duque,'' 
who hasn't seen his family since he escaped Cuba last December, would 
be reunited with his relatives. It is not clear when or how the reunion 
will take place. But U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano, a Bronx congressman who 
has been working with the Vatican and other groups to get Hernandez's 
family to the United States, said he hoped the reunion would happen 
in time for Friday's World Series parade. Serrano never met Hernandez 
and didn't know details about the family's arrival. ``I never even 
met him.'' Serrano said. ``It's just enough to know that a mother 
is going to get to see her son.'' Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, 
also played baseball in Cuba and defected during a trip with his team 
to Mexico in 1995. He helped lead the Florida Marlins to a World Series 
championship a year ago. Juan Iglesias, Livan Hernandez's agent, said 
he didn't know anything about the visit, only that ``El Duque'' was 
planning to fly to Miami after Friday's parade and City Hall ceremony 
for a visit with his brother. Hernandez, who signed a four-year dlrs 
6.6 million contract with the Yankees in March, was banned from playing 
in Cuba for dealing with American major league scouts. He fled Cuba 
by climbing onto a rickety raft with his wife, Noris Bosch, and six 
others. They landed on a remote Bahamian island and were rescued by 
the U.S. Coast Guard.
