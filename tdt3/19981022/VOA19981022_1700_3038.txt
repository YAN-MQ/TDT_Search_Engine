After 16 months of sliding financial markets, stocks and currencies 
across Asia have rallied in the last two weeks. But as Amy Bickers 
reports from Hong Kong, analyst remain cautious about whether the 
economic turnaround in Asia is here to stay. Without a doubt some 
of the turnaround stems from the most recent interest rate cut in 
the United States. Last Thursday, the Federal Reserve slashed two 
key interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, the second 
US rate cut in under three weeks. The move lifted hopes that some 
of the liquidity in the United States would find its way to Asia. 
Another element of the regional uptrend is Japan's newest bailout 
plan. Keito Donohue, a regional economist for Barclays Capital in 
Singapore, says many investors are hoping the measures will proceed 
smoothly, especially after a leading bank signaled Wednesday it wanted 
to participate. I still think it's to early to say whether the Japanese 
bank reforms are actually going to be successful. If they are successful, 
then I think that you could see this rally prolong. However, if people 
actually take a closer look at the reforms that are going on in Japan 
and decides there's nothing really new happening then obviously the 
rally isn't real. There are other signs that Asia's economic woes 
may be tampering off. Economist say Thailand and South Korea, two 
of the worst hit economies have hit bottom and are expected to improve. 
Ms. Donohue says fund managers in Asia, the United States, and Europe 
are cautiously considering buying shares in these markets. She says 
there's some confidence that these nation's are beginning address 
their debt problems, the key cause of Asia's financial process. Thailand, 
they have actually gotten a bit further ahead. The financial restructuring 
agency which have taken over the bad loans of the closed financial 
institutions has actually begun to auction those off. So, we are seeing 
progress in Thailand. Despite some signs of improvement, analyst warned 
that few companies in Asia have restructured their operations. While 
governments are working hard to help them cope with backbreaking levels 
of debt, billions of dollars in bad loans are still weighing on firms 
around the region and many more companies are expected to declare 
bankruptcy. Amy Bickers, For VOA News, Hong Kong.
