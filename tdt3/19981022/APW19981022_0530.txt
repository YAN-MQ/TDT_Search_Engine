Paul McCartney says he has softened his stance on animal testing after 
his wife had to take such drugs to treat her breast cancer. ``I'm 
finding out now that there is quite a lot of animal experimentation 
_ some of it I suppose absolutely necessary when you come down to 
the final tests before people,'' the former Beatle said in a British 
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview to be aired Friday. Linda McCartney, 
who died in April, was a strict vegetarian and campaigner for animal 
rights, as is her husband. ``I suppose a limited thing is unavoidable, 
but it is very difficult for me to think like that because I favor 
the rights of the animals,'' McCartney said in the interview. Referring 
to the medication used to treat his wife's cancer, he said, ``If a 
drug has got to be used on humans, then legally it has to be finally 
tested on an animal. ... This was difficult for Linda when she was 
undergoing her treatment.'' He came close to tears in describing how 
hard life is without his wife. ``We fancied each other something rotten,'' 
he said. ``That's all it was. To me, she was always still my girlfriend.''
