Good evening. We are going to begin this evening by checking in on 
the state of the U.S. economy, which means so much to the rest of 
the world. That last cut in the interest rates has made a difference. 
The stock market here has since gone up for seven sessions in a row. 
That's the first time since the Asian financial crisis broke open 
more than a year ago. Here are today's numbers. The Dow Jones industrials 
up nearly 14 points today, to close at 8533. The NASDAQ up more than 
27 points.
