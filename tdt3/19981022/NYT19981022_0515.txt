Paloma Partners Management, a Greenwich, Conn., firm that runs hedge 
funds, acknowledged Thursday that it had been battered by the recent 
turmoil in the bond markets but insisted that it was still in sound 
financial health. The firm, which operates more than 10 funds and 
is said to have at least $1 billion under management, issued a statement 
in response to increasing speculation about its well-being. ``To allay 
concerns and set the record straight, Paloma's funds are financially 
sound and our portfolios are in strong cash positions,'' Donald Sussman, 
chairman and chief executive, said in the statement. Rumors about 
hedge funds have abounded since the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital 
and the recent troubles at firms like Ellington Capital and D.E. Shaw. 
Despite their secretive natures, many funds are being forced to be 
more open about their positions.
