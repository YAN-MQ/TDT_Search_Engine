Japan soon will have another attraction to take its mind off its economic 
troubles. The Walt Disney company started construction today on a 
nearly $3 billion ocean-themed park next to Tokyo Disneyland. They're 
calling it "Disney sea" and hope it will draw more than 10 million 
visitors a year when it opens in 2001. That would follow the success 
of Tokyo Disneyland, which had 17 million visitors last year, despite 
a deep recession.
