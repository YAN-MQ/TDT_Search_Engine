NASA is giving late CNN space reporter John Holliman a special tribute. 
It has renamed an asteroid in his honor. Asteroid 1989 H-G will be 
known as "asteroid 6711 Holliman". This was made possible by the woman 
who first discovered the asteroid. He was set to cover the upcoming 
shuttle launch with Walter cronkite. Miles O'Brien will join cronkite 
for the broadcast.
