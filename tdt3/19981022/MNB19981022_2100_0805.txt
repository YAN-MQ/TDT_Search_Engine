We alluded to this earlier. Late today in California, medical officials 
released the autopsy results on florence Griffith-Joyner, who for 
a time was known as the fast ers woman on the planet. Her sudden death 
at the age of just 38 last moresed a lot of questions. There was open 
talk in the news media about possible steroid use as a Contributing 
factor to heart failure. But apparently tonight no more. From Los 
Angeles this evening, here's NBC's Mike bemper. A battery of experts 
was present so there would be no doubt why Florence griffith-Joyner 
died. There was a partial obstruction of the airway resulting in a 
relatively -- relative lack of oxygenation to the lungs. A lot was 
at stake, a legend. Griffith-Joyner, triple medal winner, had been 
plagued throughout her career that she used performance-enhancing 
drugs. When she was found dead September 21 in her Viejo, California, 
home, the rumors resurfaced, speculation that banned substances were 
used. Those rumors were put to death today. She suffered an epileptic 
seizure as she slept and suffocated face down in her bed. Her condition 
was a congenital blood vessel abnormality. Tocxcoling -- toxicology 
reports determined there was nothing in her blood when she died. She 
was a unique athlete who combined blinding speed with style a Combination 
of world records, unique running outfits, and six-inch nails set her 
apart. She became a role model for a generation of young athletes. 
She took final ultimate drug test, and it's what he always said. There's 
nothing there. Her world record stand and so does her reputation. 
As the U.S. Olympic committee said today, it's time for the dark allegations 
to cease.
