In California, the state is reminding homeowners that no property 
is worth a life. People are being urged to heed evacuation orders 
if there's a wildfire nearby. Firefighters are trying to extinguish 
three large fires that have burned 15,000 acres in southern California. 
That task could be made more difficult by the Santa Ana winds. They're 
in the forecast for the weekend.
