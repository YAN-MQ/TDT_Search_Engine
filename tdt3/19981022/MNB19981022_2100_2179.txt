Another health issue, this one from "Dateline." What do I want? I 
want to know I'm headed in the right direction. I want to keep my 
options open. I...I do want to take care of my family. I want to give 
something back. I want to learn, find what's right for me, be ready 
for anything... make the right choices. I want to find the people 
who can get me there. American express financial advisors can help 
you decide what you want to do and how to get there. I want to say 
I made a difference. I want to do more.
