A close-range header from striker Souleymane Oulare earned Racing 
Genk a 1-1 home draw with Real Mallorca after Daniel ``Dani'' Garcia 
gave the Spanish club the lead in a tight Cup Winners Cup game. With 
nothing to separate the teams after the first-half, Dani leapt unmarked 
to meet a curling free-kick in the 56th-minute and fired in an unstoppable 
header to give Mallorca a valuable away goal to take into the second-leg 
of this second-round match. The visitors kept up the pressure and 
Yugoslav mid-fielder Veljko Paunovic came close to making it 0-2 in 
the 69th minute with a low shot from the edge of the penalty area 
that flew just wide of the goal. Oulare, who had looked dangerous 
throughout the match, struck the equalizer in the 71st minute. Sprinting 
toward goal, he met a high, near-post corner just ahead of Carlos 
Roa and sent the ball spinning past Mallorca's Argentine goalkeeper. 
Genk came agonizingly close to taking the lead in the 89th minute 
when Mike Origi hurled himself at a soaring cross from Besnik Hasi 
only to see his header crash against the crossbar. Mallorca's Goran 
Stankovic was send off in the 83rd minute for second bookable offense. 
Some 23,000 supporters including Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene 
watched the game in the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels.
