The World Series sweep completed a statement of superiority for the 
New York Yankees. This team won 125 games, more victories than any 
U.S. Major League Baseball franchise ever managed in a season. This 
team finished with a .714 winning percentage, the best in more than 
70 years and fourth best in history. This team broke a 44-year-old 
league record by winning 114 regular-season games and then went 11-2 
during the postseason. But is this team the greatest in baseball history? 
Consider the candidates: 1906 Chicago Cubs These were the Cubs of 
Tinker to Evers to Chance, a double play combination that inspired 
poetry and wound up in the Hall of Fame. The pitching staff was headlined 
by Three-Finger Brown, who won 26 games and posted a 1.04 ERA. These 
Cubs won 116 games for a winning percentage of .763, both major league 
bests. Its only slip was losing the World Series in six games to the 
Chicago White Sox, an oversight the Cubs corrected with championships 
the next two seasons. 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates The Cubs' string of 
three straight pennants was ended by a Pirates team that won 110 games 
during the season and finished with a .717 winning percentage. The 
centerpiece was shortstop Honus Wagner, who hit .339 to win his fourth 
straight batting championship and seventh of his career. He also led 
the league with 100 RBIs. Pittsburgh won the World Series but needed 
seven games to defeat Detroit. Babe Adams won three games during the 
World Series, including a shutout in Game 7. 1927 New York Yankees 
They called this lineup Murderers Row with good reason. This team 
was built around two of the greatest sluggers _ Babe Ruth and Lou 
Gehrig. Ruth hit 60 home runs, a record that lasted until Roger Maris 
hit 61 in 1961. Gehrig had 47 homers and drove in 175 runs. The lineup 
featured Tony Lazzeri, Earle Combs, Waite Hoyt, and Herb Pennock, 
all Hall of Famers, and it produced a 110-44 regular-season record, 
matching the .714 winning percentage of the 1998 Yankees. New York 
swept Pittsburgh in the World Series. 1961 New York Yankees Roger 
Maris and Mickey Mantle staged a season-long run at Ruth's record. 
Maris finished with 61 homers and Mantle had 54. The team set a mark 
with 240 homers, including six players with 20 or more home runs. 
The pitching staff was led by Whitey Ford, who went 25-4. The Yankees 
finished 109-53 and beat Cincinnati in five games in the World Series. 
Second baseman Bobby Richardsaon batted .391 and set a record for 
most hits (nine) in a five-game World Series. 1974 Oakland A's The 
raucous A's became only the second franchise to win three straight 
World Series and ranked as baseball's last dynasty before free agency 
shook rosters. The A's went 90-72, with sluggers Reggie Jackson, Sal 
Bando and Joe Rudi backing a staff anchored by Catfish Hunter and 
Rollie Fingers. Hunter's 25 wins and 2.49 ERA led the league and the 
A's beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the World Series. 
1976 Cincinnati Reds The Big Red Machine's lineup overflowed with 
quality hitters: Hall of Famers Joe Morgan and Johnny Bench, and Pete 
Rose, who finished with a record 4,256 hits. The Reds beat Boston 
in seven games in the 1975 World Series. The next season they won 
the National League West by 10 games, finishing 102-60. Cincinnati 
followed with a four-game sweep of the Yankees, becoming the first 
National League team to win consecutive World Series since the New 
York Giants in 1921-22.
