A new study is sending a wake-up call. It shows 56% of women in the 
United States lack adequate sleep. And according to the research, 
female health issues are the cause. I think the most significant thing 
about the study was the relative differences between the men and the 
women. It looks as if, from comparisons with other polls, when men 
have been studied, that women have much higher rate of sleepiness 
during the daytime that interferes with their activities. They use 
more sleep medications, and they have a much more frequent report 
of insomnia than men. One in three of the women studied uses over-the-counter 
or prescription drugs to help them sleep.
