Imagine the Yankees without Bernie Williams. No, not if he leaves 
as a free agent this winter, but if he had not made the team at all. 
Gene Michael, the Yankees' director of major league scouting, talked 
in the aftermath of the team's latest World Series championship about 
how that might have happened _ if Williams had not measured up in 
a statistic to which the Yankees pay particular attention. ``If Bernie 
had a low on-base percentage, he wouldn't be here,'' said Michael, 
who was the general manager when Williams became a member of the Yankees. 
``He wouldn't have been nearly as appealing. He wouldn't have been 
the player we wanted. One of the attractions about Bernie when he 
was in the minor leagues was that he was selective at the plate and 
he had a high on-base percentage.'' Talk about the Yankees this year 
centered on the number of victories they were amassing. But the number 
Michael and other club executives believe contributed significantly 
to the team's success was on-base percentage, a statistic that has 
always been overshadowed by batting average. The Yankees' high on-base 
percentage _ at .364, they led the American League for the second 
year in a row _ is the result of the patience they showed at bat all 
year. It was the part of their game that attracted the most notice 
among fellow professionals. ``The thing that impresses you most about 
them is they work a pitcher,'' San Diego's Tony Gwynn, who knows something 
about hitting, said halfway through the World Series. ``They ain't 
swinging at nothing. They're not chasing anything. They're going out 
there; they're trying to get a pitch they can handle. To me, that's 
what they've done really well.'' Working pitchers deep into the count, 
forcing them to throw more pitches than they care to, was not a new 
development with the Yankees this year. It has been a style and a 
strategy in the making since 1990, the year Michael began his second 
term as general manager, the year the Yankees decided to seek players 
with high on-base percentages. ``That's how you score more runs,'' 
Michael said. ``That's what prompted it. In 1990, we started switching 
to get that kind of player here. We wanted high on-base percentage 
players. Every player we acquired after 1990 was a high on-base percentage 
guy.'' Michael said the team's hitting coaches in that time, Rick 
Down and Chris Chambliss, were told of the Yankees' desire and that 
they were to work accordingly with the hitters. The Yankees' minor 
league instructors were also indoctrinated in the system. Michael 
said that he and Mark Newman, the vice president for player development, 
were talking the other day about ``how we wanted high on-base type 
players.'' ``We want players to take pitches,'' Michael said. ``We 
want players to become selective.'' It was no mere whim that prompted 
the Yankees to sign Wade Boggs as a free agent from the Boston Red 
Sox before the 1993 season. By design, he became the team's role model 
of selectivity. ``Boggs rubbed off on a lot of people by working the 
count,'' Brian Cashman, the current general manager, said. ``That's 
when our team really started developing a higher on-base percentage. 
A lot of players benefited from Boggs when he was here. I think it's 
all contagious.'' The Yankees' on-base percentage for the 1990 season 
was .300, lowest in the American League. It improved steadily for 
the next four seasons, making a major leap in the season Boggs arrived 
to .353, then to a league-leading .374 the next season. The Yankees 
have led the league the last two seasons at .362 and .364. ``We've 
proven this year we're the most patient,'' Michael said. A high number 
of base runners can be a productive substitute for a big home run 
hitter, something the Yankees don't have. ``Things started to fall 
in place in terms of our team being a high-scoring team without a 
40-home-run-type guy,'' Cashman said. ``It was because we were a very 
strong on-base percentage club.'' Not that the Yankees would reject 
the big home run hitter. ``If a guy hits .250 and hits 45 home runs 
and isn't too high in on-base percentage, that's OK,'' Michael said, 
``but we haven't had that kind of guy.'' The idea behind taking pitches 
is at least twofold. Obviously, the more runners a team puts on base, 
the more runs it has a chance to score. The Yankees led the major 
leagues in scoring this season, with 965 runs. In addition, the more 
pitches hitters take, the less of a chance pitchers have to last far 
into games. ``Assuming the middle-inning pitching on most teams isn't 
as good as the starters,'' Michael said, ``if the starters have to 
throw a lot more pitches, by the fifth inning they throw way more 
pitches on average than they do against other teams. So they're going 
to be out of the game quicker and you're going to get into their bullpen 
a lot faster. It's one of the controllable things you can do.'' When 
players can't or don't do it, they find themselves playing elsewhere. 
Where Bernie Williams has always been selective, Michael said, that 
was not so with Gerald Williams, who was once thought to be a future 
starter with Bernie in the Yankees' outfield. ``One of the things 
that detracted from Gerald,'' Michael said, ``was he wasn't a high 
on-base percentage guy.'' He was traded in 1996 to the Milwaukee Brewers. 
Michael recalled that when the Yankees traded for Tino Martinez three 
years ago, his good on-base percentage was one of the attractions. 
``If Tino had been a .320 on-base guy, he wouldn't be here,'' Michael 
said. Cashman offered a similar assessment of last winter's acquisitions 
of Chili Davis and Chuck Knoblauch. ``They get themselves in hitters' 
counts,'' the general manager said. ``They're very patient.'' When 
the Yankees study possible moves this winter, they will do their homework 
and scrutinize the column headed OBP. ``It's what we looked at last 
winter, and we'll look at it this winter,'' Michael said. ``We'll 
try to keep the players we can. Bernie's a big cog in that on-base 
percentage. That's why Bernie's still here.'' But good on-base percentage 
or not, for how long?
