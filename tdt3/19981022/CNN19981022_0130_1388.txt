Genesis park! You can't go there. That's the worst neighborhood in 
the city of Charlotte. This was an open-air, drive-in, drug market. 
It was bad. It was really bad. There were no birds in genesis park... 
there were no children. There were no Flowers. They told us that grass 
would never grow in that yard... now we have a yard full of beautiful, 
green grass. And then as we did ours... other homeowners started working 
in their yards. Genesis park is a beginning. You see little, young 
children in the street playing. And it's so peaceful and so calm and 
then during the day, the children riding bicycles up and down the 
street... and playing music and it's just great. How did I know genesis 
park was getting better? The birds came back. The Fannie Mae foundation.
