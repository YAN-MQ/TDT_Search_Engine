The old 401k. It can fill up pretty fast. So where will you put the 
rest of your retirement funds? Try adding "the best of America," from 
nationwide financial services. In addition to 401Ks, we work with 
some of America's most respected funds managers to give you a wider 
choice of tax-deferred retirement products. There. Now you're on the 
right track. For more information on "the best of America" retirement 
products, call 1-800-best-481. Nobody loves cars more than I do. Each 
one is a work of art. So when a maker of all these chose a new antifreeze, 
it got my attention. General Motors now uses the dex-cool technology 
of havoline extended life antifreeze in virtually all its new vehicles. 
The same patented formula you can use in your car. For 5 years or 
150,000 miles. So do what GM did, switch to havoline. I use it in 
my car. I only wish this were it.
