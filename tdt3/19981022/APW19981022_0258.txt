Police shot dead two men linked to a killing spree in which some victims 
have been accused of witchcraft, newspapers reported Thursday. The 
two men were suspected in a wave of mysterious murders of more than 
150 people over the past three months in the eastern end of the main 
island of Java. Some of those who died were Muslim clerics accused 
of sorcery. Vigilante groups formed to strike back at the alleged 
assailants, and at least nine murder suspects have been killed. Several 
were beheaded and triumphant mobs paraded their heads on sticks in 
village streets. Police on Wednesday reportedly killed two suspected 
attackers, Buki and Surahmad, while raiding their houses in Jember, 
about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of the capital, Jakarta. Surahmad 
had refused to leave his home despite police warning shots and attacked 
officers with a knife, the newspaper Jawa Pos reported. On Thursday, 
50 youths briefly demonstrated outside the presidential palace in 
Jakarta to demand a thorough investigation of the killings in East 
Java province. Dozens of soldiers and police with sticks and guns 
pushed the protesters back to their bus parked nearby. Officers detained 
one demonstrator. Some victims of the mysterious killings that began 
in August in the regency of Banyuwangi were preachers or members of 
the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim 
organization. The government has rejected a claim by Nahdlatul Ulama 
leader Abdurahman Wahid that an unidentified Cabinet minister was 
behind the killings.
