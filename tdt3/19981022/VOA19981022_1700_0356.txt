President Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein returned to those Middle 
East peace summits. Negotiations at the secluded site in the US State 
of Maryland later. The Israeli and Palestinian participants held one-on-one 
discussions at the site hoping to bridge some differences standing 
in the way of the next Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank. 
Correspondent Mickse Beon reports Mr. Clinton spent much of Thursday 
at the summit talks for more meetings with both sides. In an indication 
of progress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
Leader Yassir Arafat have met face to face without US mediation less 
than 24 hours after the Israeli leader threaten to quit the talks 
and return home without an agreement. But, whether serious obstacles 
have been overcome it's too early to say. State Department Spokesman 
James Rubin briefed reporters in a conference call from the summit 
site. I don't think anybody knows which way this is going to go at 
this time. Nobody has made plans for any agreement because we're in 
the midst of seeing whether some of these key decisions that the president 
asked the parties to make can be made. Earlier, Mr. Rubin said major 
progress had been made in getting both sides to accept an American 
initiative addressing Israeli's concerns about terrorism. Just a day 
earlier, the Israeli side said the Palestinian had not done enough 
to address security issues leading to the threat by the Israeli prime 
minister to fly home without an agreement. Despite signs that the 
atmosphere on the eighth day of these talks has improved, US officials 
say significant gaps remain and are stopping short of suggesting this 
summit could be wrapped up today. Mickse Beon, VOA News, at the Middle 
East peace talks in Wye Mills, Maryland.
