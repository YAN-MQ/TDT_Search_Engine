President Clinton has vetoed a bill that would have allowed the United 
States to pay most of the $1.6 billion it owes the United Nations. 
Mr. Clinton said Wednesday he took the action because the measure 
contained unrelated antiabortion language that he opposes. However, 
the veto is not expected to result in Washington losing its vote in 
the U.N. General Assembly. The budget deal signed by Mr. Clinton earlier 
in the day contains nearly $200 million to cover part of the U.S. 
arrears. The United States transferred $50 million from that package 
to the United Nations Wednesday. U.S. and U.N. officials say this 
and subsequent payments will be enough to allow Washington to keep 
its General Assembly vote for now. Nevertheless, U.N. Secretary General 
Kofi Annan accused the United States of failing to honor its contract 
with the rest of the world.
