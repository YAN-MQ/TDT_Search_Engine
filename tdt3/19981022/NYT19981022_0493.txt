The Federal Communications Commission on Friday issued a proposed 
set of rules intended to settle a dispute over high-tech wiretapping 
that has pitted the FBI against the telecommunications industry and 
privacy advocates. The dispute centers on a 1994 law, the Communications 
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which was intended to guarantee 
that law-enforcement officials would be able to continue telephone 
surveillance as communications technologies evolved. Carrying out 
the law has been stalled, however, while the FBI has quarreled with 
the communications industry over cost and feasibility and with privacy 
groups that contend that the law would permit broad new government 
surveillance powers. Under the proposed rules, the FCC would give 
law enforcement some concessions, including the ability to get certain 
information about the location of a person using a cellular telephone. 
But the agency rejected some new capabilities requested by the FBI 
and deferred a decision on other issues, including surveillance of 
Internet communications. ``Congress sought to balance the needs of 
law enforcement against legitimate privacy and industry interests,'' 
William Kennard, the FCC chairman, said in a statement. ``The differences 
that remain are significant but by no means insurmountable.'' Industry 
executives praised the steps taken by the FCC, saying that the new 
laws could have been carried out years ago if the FBI had not insisted 
on broad and costly new powers. The communications agency said that 
by granting law-enforcement officials the ability to collect location 
information that is already available to a telephone company they 
were stopping short of turning cellular telephones into tracking devices.
