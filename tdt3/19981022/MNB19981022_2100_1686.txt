Also tonight, toy maker Fisher price has ordered a recall for 10 million 
battery pourered trucks marketed under the power wheels logo. They 
are toys. It was announced that several cars caught fires when children 
were riding in them. They have an 800 number. Contact Fisher price 
if you believe you have one.
