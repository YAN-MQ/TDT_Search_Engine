A report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies says 
western threats of air strikes against Iraq and Yugoslavia are questionable 
because the west is unwilling to use ground troops to obtain diplomatic 
goals. John Chipman is the institute director. Air strikes against 
Yugoslavia would not bring back Albanian refugees or shore an acceptable 
level of self-detainamation for Kosovo. The Holbrooke Agreement of 
October 1998 calls for a ground presence of unarmed verifiers, but 
does not tie with it any enforceable commitment to full compliance. 
The institute also warns US military resources are being stretched 
thin by deployments in the Persian Gulf, Balkans, and other areas.
