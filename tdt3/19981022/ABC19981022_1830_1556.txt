Finally this evening, color the world, technology on "the cutting 
edge." Nearly 30 million Americans are colorblind. They cannot distinguish 
red from green. There is no cure for colorblindness, although there 
are ways to correct it. Tonight a look through from revolutionary 
glasses. Here's ABC's Gina Smith. "A showered fire, the light of maples 
washing eye and brain." A poet's autumn -- but Lou cedillo doesn't 
see it that way. It's either dead or alive to me. I don't really appreciate 
any different colors. Lou cedillo is colorblind. His world looks a 
lot like this, and just getting around can be dangerous. Color deficient 
people have a technique to determine if a light is red or green. It's 
simple. The red one is on the top. But at night, or on a poorly lit 
street, it can be really hard to judge. Two years ago, a colorblind 
New Jersey train engineer mistook a red light for a yellow light, 
killing himself, two others and injuring 151 people. Hungarian scientists 
say they have invented glasses that can help. Help the person to see 
better the colors that they currently have a problem discriminating. 
The hungarians say a colorblind person's eye is like a badly tuned 
radio. Not tuned to the right wavelengths for red, green and blue. 
Customized for each patient, these glasses have filters to shift the 
eye's perception of the light wavelength, bringing color to life. 
Tamas wiederman wanted to go to engineering school, but there were 
all those colored wires. Yes, the colors are sharper, not faded like 
before. These glasses have changed my life. Skeptics worry that the 
glasses dim light, making night vision difficult. But the food and 
drug administration has given the scientists the go ahead to start 
marketing them in the U.S. next year. Perhaps in time to help people 
understand the poetry of fall. Gina Smith, ABC News, New York.
