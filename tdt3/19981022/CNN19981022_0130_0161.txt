After months of haggling, the battle over the federal budget is officially 
over. President Clinton signed the $520 billion spending package Wednesday, 
hours after it arrived at the White House. It includes funding for 
the international monetary fund and 100,000 new teachers. What was 
in the budget agreement came as a surprise to some members of congress. 
Kathleen Koch has the story. a spending Bill almost too heavy to lift. 
This Bill is 4000 pages long and weighs over 40 pounds. Too lengthy 
to comprehend. But only God knows what's in this monstrosity! Packed 
with pork. $750,000 for grasshopper research in Alaska. Has Congress 
gone mad? Maybe not, but unable to resolve disputes over the budget, 
republican leaders hammered out a deal with the White House, lumped 
the remaining spending bills together and told members of Congress, 
take it or leave it. This one was two months late and it's 1,057 pages 
long weighing 14 pounds. Back in the '80s, lumping appropriations 
bills into a catch-all bill was routine until Ronald Reagan called 
lawmakers on the carpet. And if you do, I will not sign it. Then, 
the federal deficit was climbing, and for a while, lawmakers united 
to fight that instead of one another. Things changed this year, when 
the government ran a surplus. Those forces that restrained them, kept 
them from each other's throats are gone. And a new fight will begin, 
which is how should we spend that surplus. One senior democrat is 
furious that their inaction gives the president immense bargaining 
power. Allows him to dictate virtually to the appropriations committees 
of the house and Senate. And I don't like that. Even if he's a democrat? 
I don't care if he's a democrat or not. It's not just veteran senators 
who are disgusted over the process. Chuck Hagel is a republican freshman. 
If the republican party is not responsible, and we can't lead and 
we can't govern, American people should change it and throw us out 
of office. Congress has averted another government shutdown. And some 
now suggest passing a budget every two years, to lessen the battles 
over uncle Sam's bottom line. Kathleen Koch, for CNN, Capitol Hill.
