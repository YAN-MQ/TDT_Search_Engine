Ukraine has met all requirements for the next installment of an International 
Monetary Fund loan, but its disbursement hinges on debt negotiations 
with a foreign bank, a top official said Thursday. The IMF director 
board has postponed its meeting on Ukraine from Oct. 26 to Oct. 29 
to look into the country's talks with Chase Manhattan Luxembourg S.A. 
bank over restructuring the repayment of its loan to Ukraine, President 
Leonid Kuchma's aide, Valery Lytvytsky, said. Ukraine was scheduled 
to pay off dlrs 109 million to Chase Manhattan on Tuesday, but the 
cash-strapped government instead offered the bank to pay only 20 percent 
of the sum immediately and convert the rest into bonds with a 20 percent 
annual interest rate, maturing in two years. The scheme was similar 
to a debt conversion plan Ukraine offered to foreign holders of its 
Treasury bills last month, when the government's financial positions 
deteriorated following a financial crisis in neighboring Russia. The 
Finance Ministry has not yet made any announcements concerning completion 
of its negotiations with Chase Manhattan. ``There should be no other 
reasons for the IMF to delay disbursement of its aid,'' Lytvytsky 
told a news conference. The IMF disbursed the first, dlrs 257 million 
tranche of its dlrs 2.2 billion loan to Ukraine in September, and 
the former Soviet republic hopes to receive another dlrs 125 million 
from the fund by the end of the year. An IMF mission is due in Kiev 
this weekend to discuss with government officials new measures in 
the framework of a joint reform program that the fund agreed to support 
with its three-year loan. Lytvytsky said the government so far has 
successfully maintained major economic indicators the fund looks at 
before disbursing aid. He said the budget deficit the government pledged 
to keep this year at 2.5 percent of gross domestic product was 349 
million hryvna (dlrs 102 million) less than the IMF's target as of 
Wednesday. The foreign currency reserves, currently at about dlrs 
1 billion, are also dlrs 78 million more than the lower limit set 
by the fund, Lytvytsky added.
