The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, backs off a threat 
to walk out on the Mideast summit, and an eighth day of talks begins 
in hours... ... while the Palestinian police work to weaken the militant 
Hamas group with a series of arrests. In Uganda, the future of multiparty 
democracy is a question. In Russia, more questions about President 
Boris Yeltsin's health, and in Texas, what to do about the devastating 
floods. Hello, I'm Elizabeth Barrett. And I'm Yimani Crosby. In sports, 
the New York Yankees sweep the World Series, and we'll examine the 
business of newspapering, visiting a city where competition remains 
intense. All ahead in this hour of VOA NEWS NOW. First, the news. 
I'm Bill Hazard, VOA NEWS.
