Sri Lanka's most influential businessmen Thursday launched a campaign 
to try to end the country's 15-year-old civil war, vowing not be stalled 
by political bickering which has scuttled previous attempts at peace. 
``We will lead, and politicians will have to follow,'' declared Lalith 
Kotelawala, chairman of the powerful Ceylinco Group. ``We will seek 
peace.'' The leaders, who include the heads of all six chambers of 
commerce, are exasperated with the ruling Peoples Alliance and the 
main opposition United National Party who have spent the last three 
years disagreeing on the government's proposal to give ethnic Tamils 
more powers to rule themselves. Rebels among the Tamils are fighting 
for a separate homeland in the country's north and east, claiming 
that they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who 
control the government and the military. The guerrillas, who have 
scuttled two previous attempts at negotiations by staging surprise 
attacks on the military, are yet to comment on the new peace initiative. 
The war has reached a stalemate, with neither side gaining much ground 
in the last year, drained of fighters. ``We are doing this purely 
in order to stay competitive economically,'' said Ken Balendra, who 
heads the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. More than 55,000 people have 
died in the fighting, and defense spending has drained the economy. 
The initiative drew praise from many, but the businessmen made it 
clear that they had a long way to go. ``We fully endorse and commend 
business leaders for taking this initiative, and encourage political 
leaders to identify the main issues and work in a bipartisan way to 
solve them,'' said U.S. Ambassador Shaun E. Donnelly. The businessmen 
were optimistic, noting that both main political parties have pledged 
their support. ``We unreservedly welcome the initiative, but your 
task is gargantuan,'' said Lakshman Peiris, the minister of constitutional 
affairs and the architect of the government's stalled peace plan.
