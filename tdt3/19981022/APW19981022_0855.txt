Looking for the form that took him to this year's French Open final, 
Alex Corretja survived a tough second-set scare Thursday to beat Romania's 
Andrei Pavel 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 at the Lyon Grand Prix. Spain's Corretja, 
seeded fourth here and ranked seventh in the world, made a vital service 
break in the sixth game of the final set, when Pavel put a powerful 
forehand return from his opponent into the net. In the next game, 
Pavel failed to covert on a break point, and the Barcelona-born player 
held on in his remaining service games to win the match, qualifying 
for the final eight. In the first set, Corretja stormed back from 
2-4 behind with a series of blistering forehand returns. But the 23-year-old 
Pavel, ranked 73rd in the world, was a revelation in the second set, 
breaking the Spaniard's serve twice to take the set 6-2. ``It wasn't 
pretty tennis today,'' Corretja said. ``The match was really tough 
for me, especially in the second set, when Pavel hit four consecutive 
winners at one stage. ``But it is the first time that I have won two 
successive matches indoor on the tour, so I am very pleased.'' In 
the next round, Corretja will face surprise quarterfinalist Olivier 
Delaitre. The 31-year-old French qualifier, ranked a lowly 227th, 
lost the first set to Gianluca Pozzi, but stormed back to take 10 
consecutive games and win 1-6, 6-0, 6-4. Germany's Tommy Haas squeezed 
past Fabrice Santoro, the defending champion here and No. 8 seed, 
2-6, 6-3, 7-5, in just under two hours.
