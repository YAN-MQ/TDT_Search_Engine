Here in the United States, President Clinton has signed into law a 
$500 billion compromise budget deal, ending weeks of bitter partisan 
haggling over U.S. spending priorities. The package covers about one-third 
of the $1.7 trillion federal budget for fiscal year 1999. VOA's David 
Swann is on Capitol Hill and has this report on final passage of the 
budget measure. Members of both parties complained about the final 
product, especially conservative Republicans who wanted more tax cuts 
and less spending. Others denounced the closed-door bargaining sessions 
and what they call the chaotic process that brought the bill forth 
in the last few days of this Congress. Echoing some of his colleagues, 
Republican Senator John Ashcroft called the plan "a massive failure." 
SEN. JOHN ASHCROFT Truth of the matter is, no one knows what's in 
this colossal creation. No one claims to be its father. It's said 
that victory has a thousand fathers but defeat has no parents. This 
forsaken monstrosity, which no one claims, nor has anyone read, it 
deserved defeat today. But in the end, lawmakers overwhelmingly endorsed 
the bill, wrapping up the nation's budget and heading off any chance 
of a partial federal shutdown. The government has run on temporary 
funding since the new fiscal year started almost three weeks ago. 
Both parties claim election year victories in the $500 billion package. 
The Clinton administration secured money for education, Republicans 
boast they strengthened the armed forces while saving much of the 
country's first budget surplus in years. Among many other things, 
the measure includes about $2 billion for U.S. troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
with $18 billion going to strengthen the International Monetary Fund.
