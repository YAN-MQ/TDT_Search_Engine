China's airline industry is in serious trouble, suffering from too 
many planes and too few travelers. The carriers are slashing prices, 
as we hear from VOA's Amy Vickers in Hong Kong. China has more than 
30 airlines flying both domestic and international routes. Except 
for a lucky few, they're losing money after poor performance in the 
first half of 1998. The country's domestic carriers alone lost more 
than $360 million in the first six months of the year, according to 
official figures. Paul Lewis, Asia editor for the magazine "Flight 
International," says the Asian economic crisis is only part of the 
problem. Quite frankly, there's too many airlines and too little traffic 
at the moment, so it's driving prices down, and they're all earthing. 
Those few airlines that can fly on international routes are doing 
slightly better, but at the same time, they're also suffering from 
the general Asian economic flu. Carriers like China Southwest and 
Hinan Airlines are battling to attract passengers. Analysts say many 
carriers are illegally slashing prices to draw customers. But the 
strategy is not as successful as the airlines would like, partially 
because demand has dried up from both business and holiday flyers. 
On the business side, the closure of many state-owned enterprises 
has cut into passenger traffic. So has a decline in the number of 
overseas tourists from other parts of Asia. Mr. Lewis points to another 
factor. While China has a vast population, only 2 percent of its people 
can afford to fly regularly. I think it's 2 percent of the population 
fly. The vast majority of people go by train. Smaller numbers go by 
boat, though as incomes go up in China, more and more people will 
want to fly. But the overall growth in aviation will only happen with 
overall growth in the economy, as people earn money and have more 
disposable income. Critics say aviation industry officials built the 
center up too fast in the past few years, leading to a glut in capacity. 
That has led to a government clampdown on aircraft orders for this 
year. The country's domestic carriers were originally slated to buy 
61 aircraft in 1998. According to one official, that number has been 
cut back to 27. Amy Vickers for VOA NEWS, Hong Kong.
