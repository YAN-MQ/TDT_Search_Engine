In European news, German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schrader has met 
with the heads of several top companies in Germany to discuss setting 
up a compensation fund for Nazi-era slave laborers. The meeting in 
Hanover Wednesday was in response to lawsuits filed in the United 
States on behalf of Holocaust survivors and victims' families. A spokesman 
for Mr. Schrader's coalition partner, the Green Party, says a joint 
government-industry fund would seek to compensate forced laborers 
in return for security against lawsuits. About a dozen German companies, 
including Volkswagen, Daimler-Benz, and Siemans, have recently been 
targeted by class action lawsuits.
