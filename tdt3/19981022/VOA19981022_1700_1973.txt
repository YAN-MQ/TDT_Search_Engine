International officials are pressing both sides in Kosovo to move 
towards peace. The European Union's envoy to Kosovo Wolfgang Petrich 
said continued violence would jeopardize efforts for a peaceful solution 
in the area. Earlier, French Foreign Minister Eubar Bedrem urged continued 
pressure on Yugoslav authorities to reduce Serbian forces in Kosovo. 
Macedonia's Prime Minister Bronco Sevenkose has met with NATO's Secretary-General 
Aviar Salona in Brussels to discuss the situation in Kosovo. Ron Pemstein 
reports from NATO headquarters that the time is running out for Yugoslavia 
to avoid NATO airstikes. NATO's grace period for Yugoslavia expires 
on Tuesday. If there's no compliance by then, airstrikes can be launched 
against Yugoslavia. After meeting Macedonia's prime minister, NATO's 
Secretary-General Aviar Salona says Yugoslavia is still short of compliance. 
At this moment today, I can tell you there is still not full compliance. 
Several steps have been taken, but still we don't have full compliance 
on the ground all the forces, the force. NATO is still coordinating 
with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe about 
protecting the 2000 unarmed observers who are suppose to verify the 
withdrawal of Yugoslav troops. The secretary-general says Yugoslav 
President Slodin Milsoevic is committed to protected the OSCE observers.
