Good evening. It's not getting any better in south Texas tonight, 
and it's probably going to get worse. Texas, which was dry as a bone 
all summer, is now looking for any relief from the after effects of 
torrential rains. The worst of the flooding is south of Houston -- 
Wharton, Texas -- but the high water is widespread. NBC's Jim Cummins. 
This is the 1200 block of milam street in Wharton, Texas, today. It's 
now part of the Colorado river, which threatens to flood up to 40% 
of the city. Floodwaters are up to roof gutters in some places. The 
people of Wharton are just the latest victims of runoff from torrential 
rains that have drenched 60 counties in Texas, and driven dozens of 
rivers and streams to record-setting levels between San Antonio and 
the gulf of mexico. Today the police and national guard are using 
boats, trucks and horses to rescue hundreds of flood victims. Eula 
Gul is going back into the flood zone to get some clothes and rescue 
her dog, but the water is rising too fast. They can't drive in there. 
Most of the flood victims are eager to be evacuated, because those 
who stay behind face a greater danger of higher water after dark. 
But there are the usual holdouts. Rene Lathan is content to sit on 
her Porch and watch the water rise for now. If it's up to my rubber 
boots, then I'm gonna get out. Wharton is under a dawn to dust curfew. 
The business district is ready for high water. The fire chief says 
this floodwater is full of raw sewage. It's gonna come right back 
out of manhole until the water goes down. And today, the grim recovery 
of a car and four members of the same family in a Creek south of San 
Antonio, the latest flood fatalities. Richard Hartman, his mother 
Donna, a sister-in-law and her baby girl were caught in the floods 
as they drove home from a wedding Saturday night. That means at least 
22 of the 26 victims of the Texas floods died when trapped in their 
vehicles. Authorities warn that only six inches of water will stall 
the engine, and some cars begin to float away in flood levels of only 
one to two feet. The fire chief in Wharton expects his city will continue 
to take on water from the Colorado river until sometime tonight. Jim 
Cummins, NBC news, Wharton, Texas.
