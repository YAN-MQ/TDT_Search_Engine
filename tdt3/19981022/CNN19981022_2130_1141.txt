"Headline Sports" is next. To see a bit of what makes Dodge intrepid 
fast, let's cut to the quick. It has a sparkling 200 horsepower gem 
of an aluminum engine, grippy independent suspension, crisp steering 
and a highly functional driving space. Intrepid demonstrates a lot 
of powerful thinking... no matter how you slice it. Taz! taz! Looks 
like taz just got his AT&T phone Bill. Taz, don't you make a lot of 
calls on Sunday? Yes, taz call, taz call. Then use MCI five cent sundays. 
It's just five cents a minute. every Sunday. AT&T charges three times 
as much. Uh-oh. taz! Just call 1-800-sundays and become an MCI customer. 
Yeah!
