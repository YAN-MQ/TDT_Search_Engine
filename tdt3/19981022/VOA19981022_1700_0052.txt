Israeli and Palestinian leaders are conducting extensive direct negotiations 
aimed at wrapping the Middle East summit near Washington. US mediators 
say all obstacles have not been overcome and it is still too early 
to say which way the summit will go. State Department's Spokesman 
James Rubin. I don't think anybody knows which way this is going to 
go at this time. Nobody has made plans for any agreement, because 
we're in the midst of seeing whether some of these key decisions that 
the president asked the parties to make can be made. Before Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu and Palestinian Leader Yassir Arafat 
met privately, they held several joint meetings with President Clinton. 
Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat were alone together for about 20 minutes. 
Then, key aides were called in to begin what US mediators say is very 
serious busy. President Clinton says the hardest decision are now 
on the table and he wants Palestinian and Israeli leaders to make 
those decisions today. Israeli radio says Mr. Netanyahu has told a 
key aide that he will decide within hours whether to proceed toward 
an agreement or quit the summit.
