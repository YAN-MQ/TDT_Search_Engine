The commander of U.S. forces in the Gulf says Iran could have nuclear 
weapons within five years and poses a much greater long-term threat 
to the region than Iraq. Speaking to journalists in Washington, General 
Anthony Zinni said yesterday that moderate forces do exist in Iran. 
But he says it's not clear they will prevail over political hard-liners 
who want to build weapons of mass destruction. Considering the recent 
nuclear test blasts set off by India and Pakistan, the general says, 
Washington desperately needs to get them and Iran to sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty. General Zinni sharply criticized a plan just 
approved by Congress to give military aid to opponents of Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. General Zinni says President Saddam's abrupt overthrow 
could split Iraq into many parts and create a much more dangerous 
situation.
