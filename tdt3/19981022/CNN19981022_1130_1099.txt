Negotiations for polygram's film library are finally over. Metro-goldwyn-Mayer 
has agreed to buy the movie archive from seagram for $250 million 
in cash. That is far less than the $1 billion seagram was hoping to 
fetch. Seagram acquired the film library as part of its purchase of 
polygram earlier this year. The deal gives MGM the biggest film archive 
in the world, with such movies as "the graduate" and "when Harry met 
Sally."
