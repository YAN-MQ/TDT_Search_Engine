Well, it's time to talk about frequencies and we only have a brief 
announcement to make for you. If you're listening to us in Oceania 
or the Pacific you can consider switching over right now to 9.705 
megahertz short wave which we're now broadcasting on from 21 hours 
to 0 hour universal time. You know, we'd be happy to mail you a copy 
of the frequency schedule. Just send us you name and address. Send 
that off to VOA News Now, Voice of America, Washington, DC 20547, 
USA, or you can e-mail the information to us. Our e-mail address is 
newsnow@voa.gov. And in this case News Now is one word. So, stay with 
us as News Now continues. It's 21 hours 30 universal time and this 
is VOA News Now. President Clinton says the hardest decisions are 
now on the table at the Mid East summit and he wants Palestinian and 
Israeli leaders to make those decisions now. France's foreign minister 
warns conflict could flare up again in the Balkan region if NATO does 
not act resolutely to end the crisis in Kosovo. National sovereignty 
is the key issue in both the Kosovo crisis and the search for Mid 
East peace, that's what we examine on Dateline. All that and more 
on VOA News Now. First, a summary of world news. I'm Dave Deforest 
VOA News.
