There's another segment of the American population that has also been 
studied regarding computer use. SeniorNet, a nonprofit group, and 
Charles Schwab, an online brokerage company, conducted research that 
shows that four out of 10 Americans over the age of 50 have computers 
at home. Unlike their children and grandchildren, the older computer 
users don't spend much time playing high-tech games. Instead, they 
prefer to exchange e-mail, do research, or plan vacations.
