Passions for the prehistoric that remain unsated after the two ``Jurassic 
Park'' films are likely to be requited by the latest IMAX 3-D film, 
``T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous.'' Drooling and menacing, the monsters 
of the Mesozoic are on the march again in this brief, enjoyable dip 
into paleontology, teen-age adventure and parent-child relationships. 
Outdoing ``Jurassic Park'' and its sequel, ``The Lost World: Jurassic 
Park,'' ``T-Rex'' puts its dinosaurs visually in your face _ close 
up and personal, as the television networks like to say. Set against 
the lush ferns, moss and ancient trees of the Olympic rain forest 
in the state of Washington, these creatures seem marvelously lifelike. 
Better yet, ``T-Rex,'' directed by Brett Leonard and written by Andrew 
Gellis and Jeanne Rosenberg, doesn't rest on its technological splendors. 
Its plot takes the viewer to a paleontological dig, raises unanswered 
scientific questions and introduces some of the major figures in the 
history of the subject. To be sure, seeing ``T-Rex'' won't qualify 
anyone for a doctorate in paleontology, and an intriguing subplot 
that hints at a troubled family background for its teen-age heroine 
is left unresolved; but the film is the sort likely to whet active 
young minds to know more about the past. ``T-Rex'' is built around 
Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber), the daughter of an eminent paleontologist, 
Dr. Donald Hayden (Peter Horton). While he is busy uncovering new 
specimens at a dig in Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada, 
she is spending her summer wishing he would allow her to join him. 
Sharing his passion for the subject, she is leading tours at the natural-history 
museum where he works and completing a paper embodying her theories 
about parental instinct among dinosaurs. When Donald returns with 
his latest find, Ally speculates that it might be a dinosaur egg, 
although her busy father reminds her that no one has ever found one. 
Toward nightfall, after Donald is summoned to a meeting elsewhere 
in the cavernous museum, the find is knocked to the floor, and moments 
later, Ally begins a journey in and out of the past. Dinosaurs in 
the museum appear to come to life; she meets Charles Knight, the prescient 
artist of dinosaurs, and in the early part of the century encounters 
Barnum Brown on one of the digs that earned him renown. And from time 
to time, she finds herself in that forest primeval, among the creatures 
that fascinate her and seem equally likely to fascinate and stimulate 
young audiences. PRODUCTION NOTES: `T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS'
