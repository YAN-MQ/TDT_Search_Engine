Here they go again. New York Yankee fans let out a collective cheer 
Wednesday as the Bronx Bombers capped a magical season with their 
24th World Series title, their second championship in three years. 
``Champs!'' the Daily News cheered in its early edition. ``Sweep!'' 
raved the New York Post in lurid red ink. ``This is the greatest team 
ever,'' said Bernard Rhodes, who watched New York beat San Diego 3-0 
at the Yankee Tavern. ``The Yankees showed they are true champions.'' 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, dressed in Yankee cap and jacket, watched 
the game from a bar in midtown Manhattan and announced that _ subject 
to the approval of the Yankees _ a parade would be held Friday to 
honor the team. ``We are very proud the Yankees will be coming up 
the Canyon of Heroes for the second time in three years,'' Giuliani 
said. In the shadow of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, people spilled 
into the streets banging pots, blowing whistles, ringing cowbells 
and generally making as much noise as possible. ``This is where it's 
at,'' said 26-year-old Jay Justino of the Bronx, looking wistfully 
at the stadium. He still managed to kvetch: ``Just to think, if they 
were home.'' The Yankees were dominant all year. They finished at 
125-50, the most victories ever and the best winning percentage since 
the 1927 Yankees. Their 114 regular-season victories were the most 
ever for a champion. The picture-perfect season also was notable for 
the emotional outpouring of fan support for Yankee slugger Darryl 
Strawberry, who underwent surgery for colon cancer. Bud Harrelson, 
a member of that other famous New York team _ the 1969 World Series 
champion Mets _ paid the Yankees perhaps the ultimate compliment from 
the bar at Mickey Mantle's restaurant in Manhattan. ``If we were amazin', 
they're just incredible,'' he said.
