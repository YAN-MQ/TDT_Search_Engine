A federal task force says the number of arsons at U.S. Churches is 
declining. And it says there's no evidence of a national conspiracy 
to burn down houses of worship. So far this year, 114 suspicious church 
fires have been reported, compared with 208 last year. One-third of 
the fires investigated by the task force were set at black churches. 
There was a fear organized groups might be to blame, but officials 
say only two fires have been linked to Ku Klux Klan members. This 
is a success story. We have come together as different levels of government, 
as a nation, and as people, to confront arsons. Authorities are investigating 
seven church fires in western Pennsylvania this year that are believed 
to be arson cases.
