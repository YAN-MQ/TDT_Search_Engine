No one will be arrested in connection with the gasoline pipeline that 
erupted into an inferno over the weekend, a government official said 
Thursday, but Nigeria's state petroleum corporation has reportedly 
demanded otherwise. The explosion and fire tore through Jesse on Saturday, 
while up to 1,000 people were trying to collect gasoline spilling 
from the damaged government-owned pipeline. At least 700 people were 
killed, state radio has said. ``There is absolutely no truth in rumors 
that anybody will be arrested in connection with this,'' Walter Fejhabo, 
the military administrator of Delta State, told local leaders in Jesse. 
A newspaper report, however, said Nigeria's state petroleum corporation 
would ask for charges to be filed. ``Anyone implicated in the vandalisation 
of the oil pipeline leading to last Saturday's fire tragedy is to 
be arraigned,'' Dalhatu Bayero, chief executive of the Nigeria National 
Petroleum Corporation, told the Vanguard newspaper. The article indicated 
the company would demand that charges be pressed against people implicated 
in opening the pipeline, not the hundreds who later came to scoop 
up the gasoline. It was not immediately clear whether the powerful 
petroleum company could force the military administrator _ the equivalent 
of a governor in Nigeria's military regime _ to reverse his decision. 
Nigeria's ruling junta has not said if it has plans to file charges, 
though it issued a statement Wednesday saying the incident was sparked 
because of ``the greed of some of the people in the community.'' State 
radio said Wednesday that the death toll had reached 700, but local 
officials expected it to go higher. J.I. Ogude, the village chief 
of Jesse, estimated that 1,000 people had been killed. Counting the 
dead and the injured remains a difficult task in Jesse. Many people 
were burying family members secretly and treating the injured at home, 
fearing arrest for either causing the fire or scavenging gas. But 
in Jesse, the situation appeared to be improving for the injured _ 
whose numbers are believed to run well into the hundreds. Eighteen 
patients had returned to the nearby Sapelele General Hospital after 
a bell-ringing town crier had been sent into Jesse on Wednesday promising 
people that they would not face arrest. Officials said many more patients 
were believed to be heading to other hospitals. ``The town crier went 
out last night and the result has been impressive,'' said Josiah Oyawiri, 
a senior chief of Jesse. ``People are coming back to hospital.'' Medical 
teams were setting up offices in Jesse to help deal with the tragedy. 
Aid workers from a number of United Nations agencies, the Red Cross 
and doctors from Israel were on their way or had already arrived, 
local officials said. For the people of Jesse, mostly poor cassava 
farmers and small traders, the spilling gasoline offered an easy chance 
for a little extra money, despite the obvious dangers of thousands 
of gallons of fuel. ``I heard people rushing to the scene where the 
fuel was leaking and everbody was saying `God has brought wealth to 
Jesse,' and so I joined,'' said Richard James, who was hospitalized 
with severe burns. ``At the scene, I heard a deafening explosion ... 
and before I could know what was happenning, I was already on fire.'' 
It remains unclear what caused the explosion. Government officials 
have said they believe scavengers' tools set it off, while some news 
reports have blamed a lit cigarette. On Thursday, flames continued 
to occasionally flare from the pipeline, while firefighters stood 
nearby waiting for the fuel to burn itself out of the pipeline's Jesse 
section. The entire pipeline runs about 600 kilometers (380 miles), 
from the southeastern city of Warri to the northern city of Kano. 
Despite being the world's sixth-largest oil producer, Nigeria remains 
a fuel-starved country, its petroleum industry is hobbled by corruption 
and mismanagement. Refineries are in desperate need of repair, black-market 
gasoline is often marked up 1,000 percent and lines at gas pumps can 
last for days.
