Meanwhile, another Olympic gold medal winner is in the news, gymnast 
dominique Moceanu is raising new questions about the role parents 
play in molding young athletes and young minds. Moceanu is suing her 
mother and father, as you may have heard, and at 17 yearsf age, she 
wants to be declared an adult so they no longer control her money, 
life, or destiny. She also accuses them of stealing her childhood. 
George Lewis tonight on what went wrong here. The question, where 
is Dominique Moceanu? Today, somewhere in hiding. On Sunday, the 17-year-old 
Olympic gold medalist ran away from her home in houston and, with 
a law officer, filed a lawsuit asking to be declared an adult charging 
that her father has mismanaged her earnings, that her trust fund is 
insolvent. She wants the right to be able to act as an adult person, 
which she will be in September of 1999. Now, she does not want to 
be broke when she turns 18. As to where Dominique is right now, neither 
her lawyer nor her court-appointed guardian, yell yell yell, will 
say. She is with friends, and she is safe. The lawsuit alingts that 
Dominique's earnings, friends say as much as $4 million, went into 
building this Houston gym, run by her father. I think that he definitely 
took her money and sort of did what he wanted to do with it without 
her knowledge of what he was doing. Last year, she said she needed 
the gym. It's not only for me. We have public training, and a lot 
of kids are coming in there and having a Good training facility. I 
needed somewhere to train. Dominique had a new coach, but she was 
fired over the weekend by the gymnast's father. Now he says that the 
coach is one of those who, in his words, brainwashed his daughter 
to leave home. This has come to business, finally. Somebody's after 
her money, after her estate. A family friend describes Dominique's 
mother, Camilla, as physically sick over this dispute. Camilla is 
a wonderful mother, and this is tearing her heart apart. She told 
me this morning this isn't the domneem that she knows. But her lawyers 
disgrygrees. Moceanu is not being influenced unduly by anyone. There 
will be a court hearing November 11 to decide whether the lawsuit 
goes forward. In the meantime, Moceanu's parents have been told not 
to contact her. George Lewis, NBC news, Los Angeles.
