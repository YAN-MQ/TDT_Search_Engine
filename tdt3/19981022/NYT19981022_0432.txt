Young consumers have been under scrutiny from the 1940s, when Seventeen 
magazine popularized the term ``teen-ager,'' to the 1960s, when Paul 
Lynde asked ``What's the matter with kids today?'' in ``Bye Bye Birdie,'' 
to the 1990s, when adults learned that the word ``whatever'' could 
have an almost infinite number of meanings. Now a major agency is 
enlisting teen-agers themselves to help explain and predict their 
behavior. The survey, called Teen Link, is a yearlong qualitative 
look at the booming teen-age market by Bates USA in New York, part 
of the Bates Worldwide agency owned by Cordiant Communications Group. 
The survey, conducted with Teen-Age Research Unlimited in Northbrook, 
Ill., is intended to offer marketers insights into a growing demographic 
group that spent an estimated $91.5 billion to $122 billion last year 
and is significantly changing the way such products as apparel, food 
and soft drinks are sold. The participants in Teen Link form a panel 
of 36 students in grades nine through 12, who live in 13 urban and 
suburban markets across the country. They were selected to provide 
a cross section of contemporary teen-age life styles; for instance, 
about a third come from one-parent households or families affected 
by divorce. The teen-agers are delivering reports every other month 
on such disparate subjects as gender perceptions and stereotypes, 
life 15 years from now, their relationships with adults and heroes. 
Participants are asked to submit their material in nontraditional 
ways. Once, for example, they were sent disposable cameras and asked 
to photograph the people, places and objects they deem most significant 
in their lives. ``Our mission is to help clients gain a sustainable 
competitive advantage in the marketplace,'' said Marylin Silverman, 
executive vice president and director for strategic planning and research 
at Bates USA, which works for advertisers like CVS, the Warner-Lambert 
Co. and Wendy's International Inc. ``To do that, you have to know 
consumers, how they live, breathe, eat. ``An in-depth understanding 
of teen-agers is particularly important,'' she added, ``because they're 
so changeable, less set in their way. To talk to them, you have to 
keep on top of those changes.'' While teen-agers ``have always been 
an important market,'' Ms. Silverman said, ``this group, the children 
of the baby boomers, is much more powerful.'' ``Many teens are now 
responsible for grocery shopping for the family, and they influence, 
and participate in, buying decisions for products like cars and computers,'' 
she said. So far, three Teen Link assignments have been fielded out 
to the participants. The responses so far indicate that they ``have 
values that will make them different from the baby boomers and Generation 
X,'' said Janice Figueroa, a senior vice president and senior strategic 
planner at Bates USA. ``It's important to understand their values 
so we can keep up with them as they grow up,'' she added. ``And these 
teens feel good about themselves and about the future. They enjoy 
being teens and think they can make a difference in the world. And 
they believe you can be cool, but still be responsible.'' One insight 
already gleaned from the survey, Ms. Figueroa said, is that if teen-agers 
feel comfortable with who they are, advertising that tries using appeals 
to insecurity and ``peer pressure tactics'' to influence buying decisions 
``is not going to work with this generation.'' Another insight, Ms. 
Silverman said, was that marketers ought to ``give these teens a voice 
in'' and ``an opportunity to interact with'' campaigns because of 
what Ms. Figueroa described as ``their access to an amazing amount 
of information from the Internet, numerous television channels and 
other sources.'' That was reflected in the assertive responses the 
panel participants gave to many questions they were asked. For instance, 
in the survey about life in 2013, one teen-ager replied: ``I will 
be out of school and have my master's in marketing. I will have a 
job with a big corporation. I won't be the boss yet, but in a couple 
of years I will be.'' And maybe thinking of awarding an account to 
the agency that sent those surveys back in 1998?
