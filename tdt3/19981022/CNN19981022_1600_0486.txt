This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather" 
forecast for Friday. Very cool, high pressure will continue to push 
eastward in the eastern United States. But on the back side of it, 
we'll already begin to see some areas warming up just a bit. We will 
continue to see some showers and mountain snow showers through the 
southwest. There's also rain headed toward the northwest. Friday's 
highs looking like much of the country will see 60s and 70s. Just 
40s into New England, though. There will be some 80s, but they'll 
be confined to the desert southwest. Looking ahead to Saturday, rain 
and windy weather moves into the northwest. There could be some thunderstorms 
in southern Florida. Temperatures will be in the 60s mostly across 
the north, 70s and 80s in the south. On Sunday, scattered showers 
in the upper midwest, and moving toward the rocky mountains with cooler 
weather through that region. And on Monday, showers in the northwest 
through the plains states and a few thunderstorms are possible in 
Florida. Don't forget you can find four-day forecasts for more than 
7,200 cities on cNN interactive at CNN.com.
