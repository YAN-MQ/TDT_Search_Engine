Lingering fear from the 30-year Basque rebellion was tempered by cautious 
hopes for peace Thursday as Basques prepared to vote in Sunday's local 
elections. The extremist ETA armed commandos have killed nearly 800 
people in their quest for a separate Basque nation in parts of Spain 
and France. Five weeks ago, however, ETA declared an open-ended cease-fire. 
Since then, the group's political wing, Herri Batasuna, and the Spanish 
government have been positioning themselves for possible peace talks. 
Elections of a regional president and all 75 seats in the Basque Parliament 
will test how their post-truce messages are being received. Prime 
Minister Jose Maria Aznar has said the peace process cannot begin 
in earnest until ETA lays down its weapons forever. The latest polls, 
released last week, suggested that the mainstream Basque Nationalist 
Party will win the most seats, but fall short of a majority, just 
like in the last legislature. This will mean looking for parliamentary 
allies. It's unclear whether the cease-fire will translate into greater 
support for other Basque nationalist parties, like Herri Batasuna, 
or for non-nationalist ones, like the Basque branches of Aznar's conservative 
Popular Party and Spain's main opposition Socialist Party. The Spanish 
government hopes that a strong showing by non-nationalists will give 
it more leverage in future talks, either with moderate Basque nationalists 
seeking more autonomy, or radical ones seeking full independence. 
HB spokesman Josu Telleria Uriarte said for the peace process to advance, 
the government must transfer more separatist prisoners from jails 
scattered around the country to ones in the Basque region. Telleria 
said Herri Batasuna and the ETA share the goal of an independent homeland 
for the Basque people. ``The Madrid government lets us run a few things. 
We don't want that. We want to make our own decisions,'' Telleria 
said. ``Once we are a state we can have wonderful relations with Spain.'' 
Basque voters say they relish the idea of elections without the threat 
of violence. ``This is a great opportunity,'' said a 36-year-old woman 
walking along San Sebastian's elegant seafront promenade. ``But people 
wonder if the cease-fire is for real.'' Like just about everybody 
else out on the promenade enjoying the warm autumn sun, she refused 
to give her name. That's the other element of Basque politics these 
days, a lingering wariness of saying the wrong thing to the wrong 
person. ``After so many years of this, nobody talks about politics,'' 
said a 28-year-old Basque man who works for a construction company. 
``It is fear.''
