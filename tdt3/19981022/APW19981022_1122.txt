The Cincinnati Reds hadn't heard anything from baseball Thursday on 
the future of controlling owner Marge Schott, and Schott wasn't talking. 
Baseball officials are preparing to announce a decision that could 
end her 14-year reign as the Reds' managing partner. She reportedly 
has agreed to sell her controlling shares, with the understanding 
that U.S. Major League Baseball will otherwise continue her 2 1/2-year 
suspension from day-to-day operation of the team. She began the punishment 
in 1996 for having made inflammatory remarks about minorities. Baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig told Cincinnati television station WCPO Thursday 
that he did not expect an immediate announcement. Baseball planned 
to wait until after the World Series to make an announcement regarding 
Schott. But even though the Series is over, baseball is under no immediate 
pressure to act because Schott's current suspension lasts through 
the end of the month. Three Ohio newspapers _ the Dayton Daily News, 
Cincinnati Post and Cincinnati Enquirer _ reported Thursday that baseball's 
decision would be announced shortly. According to published reports, 
Schott has agreed to sell her 6 1/2 partnership shares, including 
two general partner shares, before the end of the calendar year. If 
she doesn't, baseball officials reportedly are ready to extend Schott's 
suspension until the end of the Reds' general partnership agreement 
on Dec. 31, 2000. Schott declined comment from her home Wednesday 
night. She did not return a call to her office Thursday. The Reds 
have not been told anything by major league baseball, Reds spokesman 
Rob Butcher said. Baseball officials have not confirmed receipt of 
any written notification from Schott about her plans to sell her control 
of the Reds.
