Clearly people think there is less risk to the economy than there 
was several weeks ago. Here's ABC's Betsy Stark. On the surface it 
looks like a phenomenal turnaround. In less than two weeks, the Dow 
industrials have shot up more than 10%, almost 800 points. The NASDAQ 
has soared 18%, after months in a grisly slump. Professional investors 
who sought safety in U.S. treasury bonds are beginning to put some 
of that money back into stocks. And companies are making deals again. 
On Monday alone, there were mergers and acquisitions worth almost 
$22 billion. Investors have gained some confidence from the fed's 
decision to cut interest rates and from Congress's decision to give 
the international monetary fund money to help the next global trouble 
spot. But as good as all that sounds, few are ready to say it adds 
up to a Decisive turnaround, especially with the United States in 
an economic slowdown and unknown course. I think the problem the market 
faces is really the fact that many people may be underestimating the 
impact on corporate profits of some of the troubles around the world. 
Because so many major American companies do business in those places, 
corporate executives have been looking for ways to cut costs, heading 
into next year. That's showing up in a steady stream of corporate 
layoffs, several nounsed just this week. For every good piece of news, 
it seems, there's bad news offsetting it. Which is why many on Wall 
Street are finding it hard to trust this rally. Betsy Stark, ABC News, 
New York.
