Tonight New York is welcoming home its world champions. It was a four-game 
sweep of the San Diego pa drays. Just hours ago, the Yankees arrived 
home. They arrived in New Jersey of all places. Tomorrow they will 
be honored in a traditional ticker tape parade in downtown Manhattan. 
Tonight the empire state building is lit up in the team's colors. 
Our next guest is reporter John montone of all-news radio station, 
1010 wins is known for his broadcast at the street-level view of New 
York. He spent the day talking to Yankee fans. Good morning. How you 
guys doing? Good. Can I asked you what you picked up today? I picked 
up a knoblauch. I got a Yankee cap on. It's green. You can't wear 
the blue one every day. You're a prior tos fan, you're a Mets fan, 
you're a Detroit Tiger fan. no. Yankees. Everybody, he's got a red 
sox shirt on here. Weren't you worried about the knoblauch boner? 
No, I wasn't worried. I knew Cleveland would fault, as usual. You 
hear that, Cleveland? You look a little like Derek jeter, as a matter 
of fact. Really? Maybe. Give me a wave. From the parade, at the parade. 
Not now. I thought you wanted me to get up here and get the crowd 
going. You going to be at the parade tomorrow? Yeah. Most definitely. 
I'm taking the day off. Wear the hat to match the tie Yeah. But I'll 
have a red hat on. John montone, live with us tonight from Times Square. 
What's the broom there, John? I just want to say hello to all my friends 
in San Diego. That's mean. There's a New Yorker for you. What was 
it like on the streets today? On a bad day, New Yorkers are experts 
on everything. Let me tell you, everybody seems to agree on one thing. 
This is about the greatest baseball team New York has seen in the 
last generation. This is a tremendous team, a thrill a day, a real 
"team" team, as Joe torre said. They really ignited the city. But 
don't the wise men and women have to meet before we can give it a 
Greatness label? If nothing else, New York does have a slew of radio 
sations, and they all call in. And they haven't had the time or perspective 
to argue until 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning how great the team is. 
This is instant analysis. The garbage men and the cab bies and the 
transvestites all agree the yankees are the best time at least since 
1961. Thank you, John. John montone with the broom in the middle of 
Times Square where no one notices anything wrong about that. Thanks, 
John. Thanks, Brian.
