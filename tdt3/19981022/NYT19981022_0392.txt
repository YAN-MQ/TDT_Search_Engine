Several months ago, Vice President Al Gore cringed at the sound of 
someone introducing him as anything other than Vice President Al Gore. 
But the introductions are changing, and so is the look on Gore's face. 
At least four times on a campaign trip that took Gore to Illinois, 
Iowa, New Mexico and California this week, he was presented to the 
audience, in some form, as the next president of the United States. 
Each time, he smiled broadly, offering no hint of discomfort. For 
the vice president, a strict disciplinarian on the stump who has dodged 
the question of presidential aspirations, this is a fairly radical 
departure. Form and formality have always prompted him to stress that 
his current focus is the 1998 elections, and presidency of the Senate. 
Yet suddenly he is giving at least tacit approval to introductions 
that paint him as a potential successor to President Clinton _ a change 
that may be especially helpful in places like Iowa, where early caucuses 
in presidential election years shape the campaign. ``It's totally 
spontaneous,'' Monica Dixon, a deputy chief of staff to Gore, said 
of the presidential presentations. ``We've had nothing to do with 
it.'' As recently as August, several days after Clinton appeared on 
television to acknowledge his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the 
White House intern, Gore winced when a politician in Hawaii referred 
to his wife, Tipper, as the next first lady. No doubt Gore's uneasiness 
then derived in part from the fresh talk of impeachment, the more 
direct way for Gore to become president. But with the Nov. 3 midterm 
elections the last official barrier to 2000 presidential campaigning 
and with Congress proceeding slowly on impeachment issues, Gore seems 
more open to images of a Gore presidency. At a dinner Tuesday night 
in Indianola, Iowa, Dodie Boswell, the wife of Rep. Leonard Boswell, 
introduced Gore as ``Mr. Future President,'' and he smiled. Gore had 
the same reaction the next day in Albuquerque, N.M., where Martin 
Chavez, the city's former mayor who is running for governor, responded 
to ``Gore 2000'' signs in the crowd by saying, ``Gore 2000 sounds 
great to me.'' Here in Los Angeles, the chairman of the California 
Democratic Party, Art Torres, faced a boisterous rally of several 
thousand in a high school gymnasium on Wednesday afternoon and said: 
``And now to introduce the next president, I mean, the vice president. 
Oh, I think you like the first one better.'' That night, appearing 
at a small dinner that generated $60,000 from actors and studio executives 
for Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, who is running for governor, Gore was introduced 
by the hostess, Cindy Horn, who said, ``I will do everything I can 
to make sure he is elected our next president.'' An obviously pleased 
Gore nodded and said, ``Thank you for that introduction.''
