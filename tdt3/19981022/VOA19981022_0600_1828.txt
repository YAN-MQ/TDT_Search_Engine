Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has withdrawn his threat 
to quit the Mideast summit. The summit, in rural Wye Mills, Maryland, 
east of Washington, will then continue for an eighth day today. And 
as VOA's Deborah Tate reports, U.S. officials say President Clinton 
is prepared to meet with the parties again if his intervention would 
be productive. For most of the day Wednesday, the negotiations appeared 
on the verge of collapse, with the Israelis threatening to return 
home if the Palestinians did not make more progress on security issues. 
It was not until late evening that the Israelis agreed to stay for 
another day. When asked about the Israeli threats to leave the negotiations, 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart responded the talks involve serious 
and difficult issues, and what is needed are serious efforts to make 
progress on those issues. Mr. Lockhart says the United States still 
believes it is possible to reach an interim agreement linking a further 
Israeli troop withdrawal with Palestinian security guarantees. That 
will allow the parties to move on to final status talks that would 
deal with such issues as the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood. 
Mr. Clinton, who did meet with the parties Wednesday after three consecutive 
days with them, was briefed on the day's developments by Secretary 
of State Madeline Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. 
The president also spoke by phone with Jordan's King Hussein, who 
arrived in the Washington area this week to offer advice to the parties 
if necessary. He had been receiving cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic 
in Minnesota. Deborah Tate, VOA NEWS, at the White House.
