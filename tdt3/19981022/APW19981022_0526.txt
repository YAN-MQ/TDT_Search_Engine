Royal Philips Electronics NV said Thursday it will finalize the sale 
of its 75 percent stake in entertainment group Polygram NV to Canada's 
Seagram Co. next month. At the presentation of Philips' third-quarter 
results, President Cor Boonstra said the deal will be concluded ``sometime 
in November.'' Boonstra also dismissed market rumors that Philips 
may have to lower the selling price again, following a June price 
cut. ``We have said that it will be 115 guilders (dlrs 61.83) a share, 
and there is no reason to suggest that there will be any change in 
the deal,'' Boonstra stressed. In June, Seagram lowered its bid to 
115 guilders a share share from 117 (dlrs 62.90). Philips said the 
price cut reflected ``the lower-than-expected financial results of 
PolyGram during the second quarter of the year.'' Polygram results 
have been disappointing, mainly because of its money-losing film division, 
whose third-quarter operating loss widened to 77 million guilders 
(dlrs 41.39 million) from a loss of 42 million guilders (dlrs 22.58 
million) in the same period in 1997.
