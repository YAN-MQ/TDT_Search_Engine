Good evening. Thanks for joining us. Lynne Russell, "Headline News." 
The mideast summit that was supposed to last just four days has stretched 
to eight, and, finally, the extra may prove to be worth it. President 
Clinton returned to the negotiations in Maryland today, increasing 
the pressure on both sides. A final agreement on interim issues could 
come tonight. After meetings between Mr. Clinton, Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat, israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior 
officials, just a few issues remain. Agreements still have not been 
finalized on the safe passage of palestinians traveling between Gaza 
and the West Bank and on the fate of palestinian prisoners. Once those 
issues are resolved, a mutually agreeable final draft has to be written 
and signed.
