The NFL players association has levied its most severe penalty to 
date on an agent. Jeff nelly's involvement with Curtis Enis when the 
all-America running back was at Penn state has cost nelly a two-year 
suspension and a $15,000 fine. And police in St. Louis say they will 
seek criminal charges against ram's linebacker Leonard little, whose 
blood alcohol level was nearly double missouri's legal limit when 
he drove his sport utility vehicle into a car on Monday, killing the 
47-year-old female driver. Jerome Jurenovich, "Headline Sports."
