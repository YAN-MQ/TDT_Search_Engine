Duane Walker, "Headline Sports." The New York Yankees have claimed 
their second world series championship in three years after beating 
the San Diego padres 3-0 in game four of the fall classic. Scott brosius 
was named the series MVP after batting 471 and knocking in six runs. 
The Yankees become the first team since the 1990 Cincinnati reds to 
sweep the world series. Yankees, it's been an incredible year for 
them. They did it all season, they did it in the post season. I said 
this club, the Yankees, I'm talking about, has to go down as one of 
the greatest teams of all time. We lost last year and you get a chance 
this year to appreciate how difficult it is to get here. And you know, 
a lot of players go throughout their careers and never get to a world 
series and I've won two in three years.
