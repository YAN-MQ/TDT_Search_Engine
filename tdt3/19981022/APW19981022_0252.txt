Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa got an earful Thursday over Hong Kong's 
recession _ and pro-democracy lawmakers could embarrass him further 
if they make good on threats to withhold support from his plans for 
governing the territory. Tung has come under sharp fire from politicians 
debating over whether they should back the governing strategy he has 
outlined for the next 12 months. ``This government has insulated itself 
from the public. It's completely out of touch,'' opposition Democratic 
Party lawmaker Lee Wing-tat said Thursday as the legislature wrapped 
up a two-day debate on Tung's annual policy speech. The debate is 
symbolic, because the elected lawmakers can't tell the Beijing-appointed 
Tung what to do. But the symbolism is important because it could illustrate 
Tung's crumbling popular support as Hong Kong struggles through hard 
times that have thrown thousands of people out of work and seen property 
prices collapse. Calling Tung ``incompetent,'' Democratic Party Chairman 
Martin Lee said Wednesday that the chief executive failed to address 
the concerns of Hong Kong citizens during their worst economic downturn 
in 15 years. Three activists, including a former legislator, are on 
a hunger strike that entered its eighth day Thursday. They hope to 
pressure Tung _ a former shipping tycoon _ to step down. Tung has 
said they should find ``more constructive ways'' to make their point. 
Tung ``was not elected by the Hong Kong people. That's why he doesn't 
think he needs to be responsive to the needs of the Hong Kong people,'' 
Martin Lee said. The legislature will vote Nov. 7 on a traditional 
motion of thanks for Tung's policy address, which was delivered two 
weeks ago. Local newspapers have reported that the pro-democracy faction 
will likely succeed in blocking the motion. Despite the pointed criticisms 
of Tung, two pro-Beijing parties and the conservative Liberal Party 
have supported his plans. Outside of the legislative chambers, several 
Beijing-friendly city councilors led about 80 people in a rally to 
show their support Thursday. ``Hong Kong people unite to rebuild Hong 
Kong. Support the government,'' the activists chanted. Jasper Tsang, 
chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, 
a pro-Beijing grassroots party, said the government was heading ``in 
the right direction'' in pulling Hong Kong out of the doldrums. Tung 
had already done everything he could to revive the economy, Tsang 
said. ``If the government could solve economic problems just by announcing 
a set of policy measures, there would not be recessions in this world,'' 
he said. In 1996, when former governor Chris Patten delivered the 
last policy address under British colonial rule, the legislature voted 
to express ``deep regret'' that Britain failed to pursue full democratization 
during its 155 years in Hong Kong.
