Advertising in Russia has plunged at least 50 percent as a result 
of the economic crisis and the exodus of western investors, the head 
of Russia's Association of Advertising Agencies said Thursday. The 
crisis has forced many Russian businesses to cut all but essential 
expenses in order to stay afloat. Russia's newspaper and television 
stations have reported suffering big losses because of the shrinking 
advertising. Vladimir Yevstafyev, president of the Russian Association 
of Advertising Agencies, said the advertising market has shrunk 50 
percent to 60 percent since the crisis began in mid-August, the Interfax 
news agency reported.
