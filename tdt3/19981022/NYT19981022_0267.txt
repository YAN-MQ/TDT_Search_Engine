On the low end, there's the dinky Simba key chain, and on the high 
end the extravagant Broadway musical. With all those ``Lion King'' 
products floating around, it comes as a shock to realize there hasn't 
been a sequel to the movie until now. The straight-to-video ``Lion 
King II: Simba's Pride,'' scheduled for release in stores on Tuesday, 
is based on an obvious but sensible and cheering idea: it's the girls' 
turn to be hero and villain. Simba has grown into a protective father; 
his daughter, Kiara, is a rambunctious teen and the movie's star. 
And since Simba's evil Uncle Scar was last seen about to be shredded 
by hyenas, the new villain is a wicked mother lion named Zira. It's 
disappointing that this girls-are-strong theme doesn't play out as 
smartly as it should, but that's the one weakness in this sleek, joyful, 
entertaining film. Its hour and 20 minutes zoom along as it energetically 
spins out the durable Disney formula. There is an innocent romance, 
a big action scene, lots of music and brand new possibilities for 
products. Though it seems as if ``The Lion King'' has always been 
with us, it was only four years ago that the film became a record-breaking 
hit and Op-Ed writers fretted about children's reactions to the death 
scene of Simba's father, Mufasa. The sequel is much easier for small 
children to take. The major voices from ``The Lion King'' are the 
same, and early on there is a visual echo as Simba (Matthew Broderick) 
and Nala (Moira Kelly) stand on top of Pride Rock and raise their 
cub to the sky while Mufasa's image beams down. All that ``Circle 
of Life'' business has been taken to heart, and its warmth is felt 
strongly here. In adolescence, Kiara has Neve Campbell's voice and 
her father's questioning, adventurous spirit. Simba wants his daughter 
to stay close to the family cave. When she insists on exploring away 
from home, he sends his old pals Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the 
warthog (Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella) to keep an eye on her and 
provide comic relief (though they don't have quite the manic energy 
and wit they used to). ``Lion King II'' looks better than most straight-to-video 
sequels. The thoughtfulness behind the animation is evident in the 
contrast between the brightly colored, lush landscapes of Simba's 
Pridelands, filled with herds of zebras, giraffes and other peaceful 
creatures, and the dark, dry Outlands, where Scar's followers have 
been exiled. The young Kovu (Jason Marsden) has been chosen as Scar's 
heir, but it is Kovu's mother, Zira, who runs this evil-minded show. 
Suzanne Pleshette brings to Zira a steely ambition and a throatiness 
that suggests the depths of her ruthlessness. It's not her fault that 
there is no way to replace Jeremy Irons' deliciously scathing portrayal 
of Scar, yet these villains reveal the distance between the inspired 
creativity of the original ``Lion King'' and the competence of its 
sequel. Zira trains Kovu to kill Simba, but in classic Romeo and Juliet 
fashion, Kovu and Kiara fall in love and eventually unite their warring 
families. In happy-ending Disney fashion, they don't have to die to 
manage that. Among the five catchy new songs (and one recycled from 
the Broadway musical) the best feature buoyant African rhythms and 
the voices of the Zulu group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. ``Upendi'' is 
the exuberant song behind the requisite production number. The lively 
``We Are One'' is more subtle and graceful, attuned to the film's 
hopeful theme of regeneration. But the generic-sounding ballad ``Love 
Will Find a Way'' presents an even bigger problem than its mawkishness. 
Determined to be with Kovu, Kiara sings, ``I may not be brave or strong 
or smart/But somewhere in my secret heart I know/Love will find a 
way.'' Wait a minute. Kiara is supposed to be brave and strong and 
smart, like her dad. This slur on her character may be unintentional. 
After all, this song sounds detachable, the one intended to be played 
when the bride and groom dance at weddings. But it's sadly true that 
for all her teen-age spunkiness, Kiara is a colorless, indistinct 
character. She's not as bright as Belle in ``Beauty and the Beast'' 
or even as vehemently willful as Ariel in ``The Little Mermaid.'' 
And she's certainly no Simba. She fills the cookie-cutter role pleasantly 
enough, when she could have done much more. It's the rare sequel that 
matches the creative flair of an original, of course. ``Lion King 
II'' may be derivative, but it is also winning on its own, more than 
an excuse for Kiara lunch boxes and ponytail holders. PRODUCTION NOTES:
