Time for the broadcast for a look at the weather. For that, we go 
to WNBC, the V in New York. Good evening. We have a big day here in 
New York City tomorrow because of the parade for the Yankees. We'll 
be checking the weather on that. Around the rest of the nation, temperatures 
nice over the southwest. It's still 80 in Phoenix. 67 in Seattle. 
Temperatures are cooler across the Great Lakes and the northeast with 
readings in the 40's to around 50 degrees in places like Pittsburgh, 
New York City, Boston. This area is going to see a lot of frost tonight, 
and some lows down into the 20's and 30's a little later on. There 
you go. You see the lows as far south as Columbia, South Carolina, 
Columbus, georgia, back towards Jackson, Mississippi. Some frost as 
well, lows in the 50's over south Texas, and 70's for high tomorrow 
there and over Florida, 80's for South Carolina, mostly 60s across 
most of the nation with 50's in the northeast. Boston will see a high 
of 57. Chicago will see some sunshine, 70 degrees tomorrow in Min 
nap liss, denver, and Dallas. As we check on the parade forecast tomorrow 
in New York City, 53 degrees around 11:30. And it looks like it'll 
be very sunny and a nice day for a parade. Temperatures should end 
up about 60 degrees. As we check the future, looks like the cold weather 
will stay in place tomorrow across most of the northeast but warm 
up by Saturday. In the southern half of the country, from Florida 
to San Francisco, temperatures will be warm and the skies will be 
sunny. That's the weather around the nation. Janice, thank you.
