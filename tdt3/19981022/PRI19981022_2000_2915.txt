You're listening to THE WORLD on 91 FM, WHYY. Good evening. I'm Joe 
Presudo Pamaco, and I remind you that this is public radio. That means 
it's supported by the people who listen to the radio station, and 
that's you. Because you appreciate THE WORLD's perspective on the 
news, pick up the telephone and make a pledge of financial support 
now. Sixty dollars or perhaps $120. We have many thank you gifts at 
those levels that we'd like to tell you about when you do call. But 
whatever level you can come in at, become a member today. 215-923-1234 
is the number to call to make a pledge. That's area code 215-923-1234. 
You can put your pledge on Visa, MasterCard, or American Express. 
Don't miss this opportunity to become a member of WHYY and support 
the programming service that provides you with news and information 
24 hours a day. Thanks very much for your support. This is THE WORLD. 
I'm Lisa Mullins.
