Federal investigators are looking into a possible link between the 
world trade bombing and the bombing of two U.S. embassies in east 
Africa. Today's "New York Times" reports an office in Brooklyn, New 
York, served first as a meeting place for extremists, then as the 
U.S. outpost for the militant group led by osama bin laden, the alleged 
mastermind behind the embassy bombings. The August 7th explosions 
in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people.
