A two-time Olympic gymnast soars onto Broadway this fall in a revival 
of "Peter pan." Cynthia Tornquist got a flying lesson while the show 
was recently on tour in Connecticut. I'm flying flying flying flying 
Cathy rigby has logged more frequent-flyer miles than any other actress 
as the star of "Peter pan." You dip and you spin and you twirl and 
you -- and the audience is -- you know, like this. And it's -- it's 
just, it's wonderful. We decided to see for ourselves just how wonderful 
with help from rigby and Paul Rubin of zfx flying illusions, the company 
that provides the flying effects for the musical. Well, what it is, 
is this wraps around your body, shoulders, waist. And these are your 
leg straps. So we have a nice cushion for that. That's important. 
And then your wire gets hooked up right into there. This is the wire 
that goes into the harness. Look how little this is. This is -- this 
is probably the width of a heavy-duty -- A kite string -- A kite string, 
a pencil lead -- but this little thing holds a lot. 1/16th of an inch. 
Now that was good, I -- I didn't now that. It's very tiny. But believe 
me, it -- it holds. And if it doesn't hold, I'll be the first to know, 
because now it's my turn to fly. Paul hooks the wire to the harness 
and Cathy offers some last-minute instructions. You're, you know, 
you're gonna want your knee facing the direction you're going like 
that, and your back foot stretched out 'cause you want nice lines. 
Okay, all you have to do is think lovely, wonderful thoughts. Close 
your eyes. Lovelier thoughts. Ready, and -- up you go. Whoo! That's 
it. This is just the best. Isn't this wonderful? I love this. Whoo! 
But I don't think I'm ready to be the understudy yet. Those are the 
dips. We call those "the dips." If it looks easy, that's because the 
real work is being done backstage. Lovely, Cynthia. I do the travel 
back and forth, and Michael lifts Cathy up. And,it's kind of like 
an etch-A-sketch, we have to work together to get the right picture. 
He has a harder job though, because if I let go of the rope, she just 
stops. If he lets go of the rope, she hits the ground. Whoo! It's 
a heck of a ride, but you've got to watch out for those lights. Oh 
my gosh! Oops. Cynthia Tornquist, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
