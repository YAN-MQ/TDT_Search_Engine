The death toll from flooding in Texas has increased to at least 26 
with the discovery of the bodies of four family members in a submerged 
car in San Antonio. Closer to the Gulf Coast, downstream communities 
have yet to see the worst of the flooding. Rob Rice of member station 
KUHF reports. The town of Wharton sits along the Colorado River about 
an hour southwest of Houston. Authorities advised about 4,000 people 
to leave their homes amid fears half the town will end up under water. 
Texas law forbids mandatory evacuation. While some people chose to 
sit tight, many left. Some had to be ferried to higher ground. It 
was thought the Colorado would crest this afternoon or this evening, 
but now comes word the river won't stop rising until sometime tomorrow. 
The Colorado River at Wharton is just half a foot below the record 
48 feet set during a winter flood in 1991. Three days of heavy rain 
again last weekend have flooded Texas rivers and bayous in 60 counties.
