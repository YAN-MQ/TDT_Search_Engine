With Kosovo's cease-fire still mostly holding, Western officials pressed 
both Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians 
on Thursday to do more to achieve lasting peace in the embattled province. 
The French foreign minister warned that Milosevic still must pull 
out more troops, and U.S. envoy Christopher Hill and European ambassadors 
began new talks in the provincial capital Pristina with moderate ethnic 
Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
