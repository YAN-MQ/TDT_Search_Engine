The wife of a bakery owner was abducted Thursday, becoming the 14th 
kidnap victim this year in Zamboanga and nearby provinces in the southern 
Philippines, police said. Elizabeth Arquiza was on her way to pick 
up her children at school when she called her husband from a shopping 
center to tell him that three men were following her, Zamboanga police 
chief Karib Muammil said. The husband rushed to the shopping center 
but found her gone. Witnesses said they saw three men leading her 
away but did not see where they went, Muammil said. No ransom demand 
has been received, he added. Thirteen other people were kidnapped 
earlier, including Italian priest Luciano Benedetti and two Hong Kong 
and one Malaysian Chinese. One victim, a businessman, was released 
after his kidnappers received 300,000 pesos (dlrs 7,100) for his ``board 
and lodging.'' Another, a hotel owner, was found beheaded several 
days after he was abducted. In central Cebu City, four men dragged 
Regan King, manager of a heavy equipment company owned by his Chinese-Filipino 
father, at gunpoint to a waiting car Wednesday, police said. The abductors 
demanded 50 million pesos (dlrs 1.2 million) in ransom, police sources 
said. Presidential National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre admitted 
that the kidnappings, including numerous others in metropolitan Manila, 
have become an embarrassment for the government of President Joseph 
Estrada. Estrada promised to solve the kidnapping problems within 
six months from taking office June 30. In this year's first seven 
months, 81 people were kidnapped, an average of about 12 victims per 
month, said Alejandro Melchor III, a member of the Presidential Anti-Organized 
Crime Commission. The number jumped to an average of 20 victims per 
month during the first three months of the Estrada administration, 
Melchor said. A report prepared by the Citizens' Action Against Crime 
and the Movement for Restoration of Peace and Order shows that the 
number of victims and ransom payments have increased rapidly over 
the past five years. In 1993, the groups recorded 170 people kidnapped 
and 69.13 million pesos (dlrs 1.6 million) paid in ransom. That jumped 
to 241 victims and 109.92 million pesos (dlrs 2.56 million) in 1996, 
and to 249 victims and 306.4 million pesos (dlrs 7.13 million) in 
1997.
