His look is impish. His limbs are rubber. His hair is vanishing and 
his face is a caricaturist's dream. So Roberto Benigni gets some of 
the biggest laughs in his brazen ``Life Is Beautiful'' when, impersonating 
a school inspector in Fascist Italy, he is asked to hold forth on 
why Italians are a superior race. ``Where can you find someone more 
handsome than me?'' he asks the children, leaping onto a desktop. 
``Look at the perfection of this ear!'' When he waves his hands, he 
declares, ``They dream about these!'' Benigni clowns so nimbly that 
he gets as far as celebrating his navel before having to beat a hasty 
retreat from the room. Now the notion of racial perfection is no laughing 
matter. And Benigni can count among his attributes a colossal amount 
of gall. For in ``Life Is Beautiful,'' he dares to find humor and 
tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, playing a Jewish waiter 
named Guido who jokes his way through this nightmare for the sake 
of his loved ones. Benigni's film, a Cannes prize winner that's as 
likely to offend those who haven't seen it as to beguile those who 
have, is as stubbornly entertaining as he is, and as passionate, too. 
It dares to laugh in the face of the unthinkable. And because Benigni 
can be heart-rending without a trace of the maudlin, it works. ``Life 
Is Beautiful'' even overcomes a bigger problem than the gravity of 
its subject matter: the fact that midway through its story, it effectively 
turns on a dime. The first part of the film is blithe and playful, 
a fine showcase for the star and director's unstoppable verve. (Not 
for nothing is he one of Italy's most popular film stars.) In an opening 
sequence, he finds himself in a runaway car and sticks out an arm 
to protect himself _ only to confuse himself with the saluting Fascists 
who are also in town. The film's views on the imminence of World War 
II are expressed with unanticipated wit, as when Benigni's Guido asks 
a man about his political views. Before he answers, the man turns 
to his squabbling sons and exclaims: ``Benito! Adolfo! Be good!'' 
Benigni also brings an enchantment to Guido's courtship of Dora (Nicoletta 
Braschi), the aristocratic beauty whom he nicknames Principessa. Some 
of his more inspired comic inventions here come from finding ways 
to charm Dora away from the man she's supposed to marry. Forty-five 
minutes into this sweet, glossy romance, Guido and Dora glide into 
a greenhouse, and when they emerge it is years later. By then Dora 
has forsaken her wealthy family to marry Guido and they have a son. 
In the presence of this boy, called Giosue and played by Giorgio Cantarini, 
both Benigni and the film's method come into their own. The father's 
gentle buffoonery and quick-witted fibs are perfectly suited to the 
child and also to the film's way of reducing the Holocaust to its 
essential absurdity. Benigni never trivializes his material, but he 
lies euphemistically to the boy with unspoken outrage. Why a ``No 
Jews or Dogs Allowed'' sign on a bakery window, the boy wonders? These 
are just matters of personal taste, his father tells him, explaining 
that a ``No Spiders or Visigoths'' sign would make just as much sense. 
The lavish settings of the film's first half, where Guido serves dinner 
to elegant patrons (and finds a way to carry a poodle on a tray), 
eventually give way to much bleaker ones. ``What? Seats on a train?'' 
Guido exclaims when he and Joshua are forced to board a cattle car. 
``It's obvious you've never been on one!'' And when they arrive at 
a prison camp and are made to join a long line, the father explains 
that this is because people are so eager to get inside. ``Did you 
see the guy who hands out bread and jam already come by?'' he asks 
another prisoner, when the boy is hungry. When called upon to translate 
a Nazi officer's commands into Italian, he comes up with: ``We play 
the part of the real mean guys who yell.'' And: ``Don't ask for lollipops. 
You won't get any. We eat them all.'' Benigni effectively creates 
a situation in which comedy is courage. And he draws from this an 
unpretentious, enormously likable film that plays with history both 
seriously and mischievously. Piety has no place here, nor do tears 
until the final reel. ``Life is Beautiful'' plays by its own rules. 
``Life is Beautiful'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). 
It deals with the violence of the Holocaust only indirectly and in 
ways that older children will understand. PRODUCTION NOTES: `LIFE
