France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrin, says conflict could flare 
up again in the entire Balkan region if NATO does not act resolutely 
to end the crisis in Kosovo. In a radio interview, Mr. Vedrin warned 
that the alliance must keep up pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosovic to continue the pullout of Serbian forces sent to crack 
down on ethnic Albanian separatists. He said the withdrawal was well 
advanced. But he added it was not enough, and the threat of NATO air 
strikes remains. The French foreign minister met yesterday evening 
in Paris with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, who warned earlier of 
dramatic consequences if Mr. Milosovic does not comply with international 
demands to withdraw his forces.
