In Africa, a massive medical relief effort is under way in southern 
Nigeria, where doctors and aid workers are struggling to save the 
lives of hundreds of people burned in last week's gasoline pipeline 
inferno. Local hospitals near the oil town of Warry are reportedly 
overwhelmed by the scope of the disaster, which occurred when a breached 
gasoline pipeline exploded. At least 1,000 people were scavenging 
for the spilled fuel when pools of gasoline exploded Saturday. Officials 
say the final death toll may reach 1,000.
