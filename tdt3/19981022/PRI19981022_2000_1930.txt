In Nigeria, international medical teams have arrived at the site of 
a fuel tank explosion where hundreds of badly burned victims are waiting 
for treatment. At least 700 people are known dead after the fuel pipeline 
exploded. Hillary Anderson reports for the BBC. At least five doctors 
have flown into the affected area now to give emergency assistance 
to the 300 or so people still in the hospital for severe burns. UNICEF 
has sent 14,000 bags of intravenous fluid to local hospitals and has 
provided badly needed bandages and antibiotics to the ill-equipped 
health centers in the region. Even so, it seems this is not enough. 
A spokesman from UNICEF said about half of the 300 people in hospitals 
have second or third degree burns and could die unless given skin 
grafts or treated by specialists. The outside medical teams have also 
been visiting nearby villages to try to persuade some of the injured 
who had fled the hospitals for fear of arrest to return. Some of the 
victims were worried that they might be implicated in having started 
the fire which began when a spark set off an explosion at the leaking 
fuel pipeline on Saturday.
