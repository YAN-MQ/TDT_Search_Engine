The federal communications commission is expected to propose giving 
law enforcement the authority to tap cell phones. If a court approves, 
the FBI and police will be able to locate cell phone customers who 
are suspected drug dealers, terrorists or kidnappers. Privacy groups 
say the plan oversteps a 1994 law that requires companies to make 
wiretapping technology available for law enforcement. They say it 
violates the privacy of a suspect's associates, friends and relatives.
