Syria's new deal with Turkey on Kurdish guerrillas reinstates security 
cooperation between the two countries that Turkey canceled three years 
ago, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said Thursday. ``Now 
the situation has returned to its normal state concerning the security 
cooperation between Syria and Turkey,'' al-Sharaa told reporters after 
briefing Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the pact. Al-Sharaa's 
comments were the first by a senior Syrian official on the pact negotiated 
after Mubarak shuttled between Damascus and Ankara, which sought Syria's 
commitment to stop sheltering separatist Kurdish guerrillas from Turkey. 
The deal ended a standoff between the two countries that sparked fears 
a war in the region. The Syrian foreign minister did not give details 
of the pact, nor explain why Turkey discontinued security cooperation 
in the past. He said the new agreement was between security committees 
of the two countries ``whose meetings the Turks suspended three years 
ago.'' ``This agreement is balanced,'' al-Sharaa said. ``We will follow 
up on the implementation of what has been agreed upon ... and we hope 
the Turkish side will also abide by the agreement.'' The agreement 
was reached after two days of negotiations in the southern Turkish 
town of Seyhan on Tuesday. Turkey has said that Syria pledged under 
the agreement to shut down camps of the militant Kurdistan Workers 
Party, known as the PKK, on Syrian territory and in the Syrian-controlled 
Bekaa Valley of Lebanon, and to brand the group terrorists. Ankara 
says the Kurdish rebels stage cross-border attacks on Turkey in its 
war for autonomy that has claimed 37,000 lives since 1984. In the 
past, Syria has denied it supported the PKK. In a first step in implementing 
the agreement, Syria's official news agency Tuesday called the militant 
Kurdish group an ``illegal and unlicensed party.'' The Syrian Arab 
News Agency also said the pact also included Turkey's pledge not to 
``allow any activity that aims at Syrian security and stability.'' 
Al-Sharaa returned to Damascus after the meeting with Mubarak.
