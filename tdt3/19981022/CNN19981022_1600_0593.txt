Earl Shaffer says he's mighty, mighty, mighty glad it's over. Last 
night the 79-year-old hiker emerged from the Maine Woods after completing 
a 2,100-mile trek on the appalachian trail. 50 years ago, Shaffer 
became the first person to hike the trail nonstop from end to end. 
He says he wanted to celebrate the anniversary, so in may he set out 
from north Georgia. 173 days later, he finished his journey. By the 
way, he says he never plans to do it again.
