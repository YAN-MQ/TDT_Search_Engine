From National Public Radio news in Washington, I'm Frank Stachio. 
Agreement may be near in the Middle East peace summit in Maryland. 
Sources tell the Associated Press that a key hurdle has been cleared 
and a court on changing anti-Israeli causes in the Palestinian covenant. 
State Department spokesman James Rubin could not confirm that report, 
and he cautioned reporters it could be premature to say that a deal 
has been finalized on that issue. But Rubin does say that progress 
is being made. And he calls this a serious moment of serious bargaining 
on serious issues.
