When the villagers of Delain saw vases explode and candlesticks soar 
through the town church this weekend, first they called police _ then, 
just to be cautious, the local exorcist. About 50 people saw the goings-on, 
which began last weekend as townspeople were rearranging the church 
for an orchestra concert. Moving the altar a few inches seemed to 
trigger the flotation and explosion of holy objects, witnesses said. 
``Believe me, I'm not someone who's really interested in the supernatural,'' 
said Thierry Marceaux, the mayor of the tiny valley village in eastern 
France. ``But when you see it in front of you ...'' The exorcist, 
Rev. Max de Wasseige, was called in by the archbishop of nearby Besancon 
_ but he didn't hold a seance. ``It was more like a prayer session 
where people testified to what they saw,'' Marceaux said. Since the 
initial events, villagers have found a decapitated Virgin Mary statue 
and an overturned St. Francois-Xavier rolling on the ground, even 
though the church has been locked for an investigation. Marceaux doesn't 
believe the strange goings-on could be a prank played by some local 
youngsters getting ready for Halloween. ``They'd have to be pretty 
talented,'' he said.
