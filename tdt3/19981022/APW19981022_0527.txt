Not even formally in power yet, Germany's new government is squabbling 
about the future of the army. Talk by the Greens party about slashing 
Germany's troop strength was angrily rejected as premature Thursday 
by their coalition partner, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Social 
Democrats. Reflecting their antiwar roots, the Greens' platform calls 
for halving the army's size by 2002 and ending compulsory military 
service. This week's coalition deal with the dominant Social Democrats, 
who have promised continuity in defense and foreign policy, referred 
the topics to a panel on military reform. But Greens defense spokeswoman 
Angelika Beer was quoted Wednesday as saying that reducing Germany's 
340,000-soldier army to 200,000 was ``quite realistic.'' The reform 
commission is sure to call for a ``significant'' cuts in the armed 
forces, she told the Kieler Nachrichten newspaper. Fewer soldiers 
are needed to defend Germany but rapid reaction forces for foreign 
missions are likely to be beefed up and modernized, said Beer, who 
is considered on the left wing of her party. The Social Democrats' 
defense spokesman, Walter Kolbow, said in an interview published Thursday 
that Beer was not speaking for the new government. ``The future structure 
of the Bundeswehr remains open,'' he told the Flensburger Tageblatt. 
``It's not acceptable to pre-empt the planned commission with unilateral 
political statements.'' The new government's tone contrasts with outgoing 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's strong support for the army even after the 
end of the Cold War. At a military farewell ceremony last week that 
brought tears to his eyes, Kohl talked about feeling a special bond 
with the military and warned against ending conscription. The new 
defense minister, Social Democrat Rudolf Scharping, took the job only 
reluctantly under pressure from Schroeder. Scharping, who wanted to 
stay the party's leader in parliament, says he has Schroeder's pledge 
for no immediate cuts in the defense budget and troop strength. Outgoing 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe will turn over the ministry to Scharping 
on Wednesday. The Christian Democrats also took sides against the 
Greens on Thursday. Lawmaker Paul Breuer said the proposed cut would 
leave Germany unable to meet its commitments to NATO. ``Germany would 
lose its role as a stabilizing factor in the European Union and NATO,'' 
he said.
