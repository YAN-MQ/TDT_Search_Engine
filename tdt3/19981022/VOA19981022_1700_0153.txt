Sporadic shelling could be heard in the capital of war-torned Guinea 
Baso despite a unilateral cease-fire announced Wednesday by President 
Shal Berdino Veira. It's not known who started Thursday's fighting 
between rebels and government forces in Baso. The fighting came after 
President Veira ordered government forces to stop firing and said 
he was willing to meet with rebel leaders.
