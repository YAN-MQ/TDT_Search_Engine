I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." A 
cool day today over much of the east, 40s and 50s for highs from the 
Great Lakes into the northeast today. And it's turned cooler, too. 
And some breezy conditions expected in the southeast. In contrast, 
it will be warming up through the northern Rockies, back in through 
the dakotas with high temperatures back into the 70s. We check your 
forecast weather maps later today on into Friday, big area of high 
pressure dominates the weather over much of the eastern half the U.S. 
we will find some wet weather continuing in the southwest, and a tropical 
disturbance in the gulf of Mexico will be spreading showers and some 
thunderstorms, especially into northern sections of Mexico. The extended 
forecast, rain, windy conditions will affect the northwest on saturday 
as temperatures moderate in the east, back into the 60s and into the 
70s. As we head into Sunday, looking for a cooling trend over the 
northern tier with highs back into the 50s. It's warming up into the 
southeast, 70s returning as rain will be spreading into the intermountain 
west. By Monday, scattered showers from the plains into the rocky 
mountains. Look for temperatures to turn cooler again over the northern 
tier. For more weather information, log into CNN.com.
