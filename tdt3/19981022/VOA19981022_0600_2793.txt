Steve Jobs, interim chief executive officer of Apple Computer, announced 
last week that sales of the company's new iMac system has exceeded 
expectations. From its introduction on August 15 until the end of 
September, more than 270,000 units have been shipped. "The Wall Street 
Journal" quotes industry analysts as saying that more than 40 percent 
of iMac purchasers were either new entrants to the market or owners 
of computers powered by the dominant standard of Microsoft Corporation 
software and Intel Corporation microprocessors. Fred Anderson, an 
Apple executive, told the newspaper that if the rate of new customers 
holds up, it is very good for Apple's long-term market share.
