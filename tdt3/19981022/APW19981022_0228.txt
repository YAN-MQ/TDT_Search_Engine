Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov ordered rebel field commanders 
Thursday to disband their units, threatening a crackdown if they disobeyed, 
a news report said. Since the end of Chechnya's 1994-6 war with Russia, 
many field commanders have remained outside the control of the territory's 
government, and are unlikely to comply with this latest order. In 
a decree signed Thursday, Maskhadov also demanded that the ``military 
bases of these formations be eliminated immediately,'' the Interfax 
news agency reported. Maskhadov has ordered the police and security 
forces to enforce the decree and prosecute field commander who fail 
to comply, said presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev, according 
to Interfax. The renegade armed units discredit Chechnya's effort 
to be recognized as an independent state, Maskhadov said in his decree. 
Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the war 
against Russia, but no country has recognized its independence claim. 
Moscow insists the territory remains part of Russia. Maskhadov also 
planned to meet field commanders loyal to his government on Thursday, 
Vachagayev said. The talks may deal with plans to the many hostages 
who have been seized in Chechnya since the end of the war, he said. 
Police from the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan have freed 
an officer who was held captive in Chechnya since his kidnapping on 
Sept. 12, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday. Also, two Latvian 
citizens have been freed by police from Russia's Caucasus republics 
of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, the report said. Russia's Caucasus 
regions have been plagued by violence spilling over from Chechnya 
as well as their own ethnic conflicts.
