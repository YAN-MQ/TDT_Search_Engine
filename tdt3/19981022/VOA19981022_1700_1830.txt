The Israeli and Palestinian leaders have held one-on-one discussion 
at the Middle East peace summit in the US State of Maryland. As Correspondent 
Mickse Beon reports the meetings came as the two sides in the peace 
talks worked for an eighth day to overcome obstacles blocking the 
next Israeli trop pullback from the West Bank. In an indication of 
progress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
Leader Yassir Arafat have met face to face without US mediation taking 
on what State Department Spokesman James Rubin calls serious work. 
But whether serious obstacles have been overcome, it's too early to 
say. Mr. Rubin spoke to reporters in a conference call from the summit 
site. I don't think anybody knows which way this is going to go at 
this time. Nobody has made plans for any agreement because we're in 
the midst of seeing whether some of these key decisions that the president 
asked the parties to make can be made. Earlier, he said sufficient 
progress had been made in addressing Israeli's concerns about security 
that other issues had moved to the top of Thursday's agenda. Still, 
despite indications of progress, US officials are stopping short of 
suggesting this summit could be wrapped up today. Mickse Beon, VOA 
News, at the Middle East peace talks in Wye Mills, Maryland.
