The FCC wants to give law enforcement agencies the ability to tap 
cell phone conversations. The agency is proposing cellular companies 
make changes that allow authorities to find a person using a mobile 
phone. Authorities say they would be able to track down drug dealers, 
terrorists and kidnappers. Some groups complain the proposal violates 
the privacy of associates, friends and family members of suspects.
