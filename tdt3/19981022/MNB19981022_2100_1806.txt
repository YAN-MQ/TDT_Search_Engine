In Hollywood recently and in TV watching homes across the country 
there's been speculation about the health of a young star just now 
in the midst of a very hot career rise. Calista Flockhart, the lead 
actress in the fox broadcast, "Ally McBeal," is dealing with rumors 
that she suffers from some sort of an eating disorder. Kelly O'Donnell 
starts us off. She filed this report for today. Her publicist denies 
an eating disorder and describes any weight loss as slight, yet rumors 
about actress Calista Flockhart's waif-like appearance persist. Whether 
it's the type of thing that borders on the dangerous, as lay people, 
we can't make that judgment. Some observe herbs point to a dangs scene 
in this week's episode of "Ally mcBeal" as the most recent example 
of her ultraslim figure. Is she too thin, or is this just gossip in 
a business where appearance counts? Early this year when Calista Flockhart 
won a golden globe award, her weight didn't raise questions. But by 
Emmy time, some watchers noticed a change. Her Pr rep said the Emmy 
dress accentuated her thinness. When asked recently to respond to 
rumors about an eating disorder, she passed. I'd rather not talk about 
it. Thank you. Magazines and other papers picked up the buzz. Production 
has shut down indefinitely for "Ally McBeal." Calista Flockhart is 
now in a clinic being treated for anorexia. But the producers denounced 
this story on a New York TV station as totally false. The show's creator, 
David Kelley, offers this explanation. She's a small person to begin 
with, so I guess it's an easy thing to scrutinize, but that's probably 
one of the Negative byproducts of having a Successful show. Every 
episode she loses another five pounds. These fans in San Jose watch 
every week and wonder if the weight loss they see is a sane of trouble. 
I hope that the publicists aren't trying to cover up a serious problem, 
because if she is having some problems with her weight, I think it 
needs to be addressed. To help dispel the talk, Calista Flockhart 
phoned into an L.A. radio show that joked about sending her food. 
But many do worry, fearing the actress may not be as healthy as she 
claims. Kelly O'Donnell, NBC news, Los Angeles.
