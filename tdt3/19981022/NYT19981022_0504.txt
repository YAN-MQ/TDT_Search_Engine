Blue-chip stocks staged a late comeback Thursday and pushed the Dow 
Jones industrial average to a seventh straight gain while the Nasdaq 
market continued a two-week advance. ``The market looks great,'' said 
Gary Kaltbaum, the chief technical analyst at J.W. Genesis Securities. 
``Every day it's repairing itself from the damage that had been done.'' 
Oil stocks fell on another batch of poor earnings, notably Chevron's, 
dampening early trading, but the Dow, down as much as 97 points during 
the day, climbed after lunch and finished with a modest gain of 13.91 
points, or nearly 0.2 percent, to 8,533.14. The gain in the technology-laden 
Nasdaq was a much heftier 1.67 percent, lifting the index to 1,702.64, 
or nearly 20 percent above its low on Oct. 8. Microsoft, whose antitrust 
trial began on Monday, once again led the way, rising 3 9/16, to 110. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index edged slightly higher, rising 
8.56 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,078.48. Prices of Treasury bonds 
fell Thursday, raising interest rates, suggesting resumed outflows 
of the money that had poured in when the risk of world economic meltdown 
seemed most acute. With credit now beginning to flow more freely _ 
and the difference in borrowing costs for borrowers of various quality 
narrowing _ a sense of relative stability has emerged on Wall Street. 
Bank and brokerage stocks are no longer in retreat but on the rise, 
with BankAmerica and Chase Manhattan, for example, up Thursday by 
2 11/16 and 2 1/16, respectively. Merrill Lynch climbed 1}, to 55 
3/16, after stumbling to a low of 35} on Oct. 8. To James Paulsen, 
chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis, 
the key to market recovery has been the decline in the dollar, which 
he said brought some stability to distressed currencies in Asia and 
other regions and allowed officials around the globe to cut interest 
rates. ``There is a lot of rocket fuel under this stock market if 
you just convince people we're not in a global abyss,'' Paulsen said. 
He called the extent of this year's decline in stocks ``vastly underappreciated'' 
_ thus putting them in position to rally _ because the decline in 
bond yields combined with the drop in stock prices have made equities 
more attractive than they were in any of the previous 12 postwar bear 
markets. Other upbeat analysts pointed to earnings reports for the 
third quarter that have matched or slightly beaten expectations and, 
perhaps just as tellingly, to the fact that the handful of surprise 
disappointments has seldom had wide repercussions. ``Most things seem 
to be coming in on line, maybe a penny or two better,'' said Joseph 
Yurman, managing director of BankBoston Robertson Stephens. Chevron, 
however, reported an unexpectedly severe 47 percent drop in third-quarter 
profits, and its shares slumped 5}, to 81{. Atlantic Richfield, also 
reporting lower profits that reflected low oil prices, fell 2{, to 
67 1/16, while Exxon, which reported on Wednesday, and Mobil fell 
3 13/16 and 3, respectively. At the same time, shares of Halliburton, 
Schlumberger and some other companies in the oilfield-equipment business 
rose a point or more. What had been a dormant market for new issues 
was enlivened by the arrival of Conoco, which traded 38.5 million 
shares and finished at 24 7/8, up 1 7/8 from its offering price of 
23. This DuPont spinoff was the biggest U.S. initial public offering 
ever. Among Dow components, Procter &AMP; Gamble was up 3 3/16, to 
87, to account for 94 percent of the index's modest gain. General 
Electric gained 2}, to 86 5/8. Most drug stocks posted solid gains, 
with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Warner-Lambert gaining more 
than 2 points, but Baxter International plunged 7 7/8, to 57, on fears 
about future earnings growth. On the New York Stock Exchange, there 
were 1,852 stocks with gains compared with 1,228 declines, and the 
gap by which new lows exceeded new highs _ 37 to 28 _ continued to 
narrow Thursday. Volume was again moderate by recent standards, 754.97 
million shares. The Russell index of 2,000 small-company stocks resumed 
its advance, climbing 1.8 percent, to 366.40, beating even the Nasdaq 
composite. Overseas stock markets were mixed, moving higher by 3.44 
percent in Brazil, 0.5 percent in Japan and 0.4 percent in Britain 
but falling 1.88 percent in Germany, and 0.6 percent in Paris.
