A tank shell fired from the Israeli-occupied zone injured a man in 
south Lebanon on Thursday, the second case of civilians being injured 
by such shelling this week, Lebanese security officials said. Mohammed 
Naim Atewi, 38, was wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel from a shell 
that exploded outside his house in the village of Kfar Roumman near 
the market town of Nabatiyeh, the officials said. Speaking on customary 
condition of anonymity, the officials said the shell was fired from 
an outpost manned jointly by Israeli forces and their allied Lebanese 
militiamen in the occupied zone. It was not immediately clear whether 
the shell was fired by Israeli troops or the Israeli-backed South 
Lebanon Army militia. On Monday, two Lebanese civilians, including 
a 12-year-old girl, were injured when a shell from the occupied zone 
exploded near their houses about a kilometer (half a mile) away. Israel 
set up the zone in 1985 to shield its northern towns from cross-border 
guerrilla attacks.
