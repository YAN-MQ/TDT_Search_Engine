Gunmen confronted a ``Dateline NBC'' television crew in Haiti's capital 
and drove off with their vehicle and equipment, the crew's interpreter 
said Thursday. The robbery occurred about 1 p.m. Wednesday at a busy 
intersection on Delmas Road in Port-au-Prince. Five or six men in 
a pickup blocked a vehicle carrying ``Dateline NBC'' correspondent 
Lea Thompson, two camera crew members and an interpreter. The robbers 
forced them to get out at gunpoint, stole their equipment and papers 
and escaped in their vehicle, said Kathie Klarreich, the crew's interpreter 
and driver. No one was hurt, and there were no immediate arrests. 
The crew was continuing its assignment, said ``Dateline NBC'' executive 
producer Neal Shapiro. A Haitian police officer witnessed the robbery, 
Klarreich said. ``I feel enraged that something like this can happen 
in broad daylight,'' she said. ``But I understand the policeman _ 
I wouldn't have done anything either. What can one person do against 
a team of well-armed criminals?''
