And finally, folks in the central Asian country of Trakministan will 
soon be able to proclaim that "Coke is it" for whatever reason. The 
first batch of Coca-Cola with the label "Made in Trakministan" has 
gone on sale throughout the country. The soft drink hit the shelves 
after the ceremonies to open a local plant which was rebuilt and modernized 
with a $14 million investment by Coca-Cola. Bottoms up on PRI, Public 
Radio International.
