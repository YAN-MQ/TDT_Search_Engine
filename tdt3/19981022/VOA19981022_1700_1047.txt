You're tune to the Voice of America coming to you from Washington. 
I'm Tom Crosby with Susan Yawkey bringing you this hour of VOA News 
Now. It is 21 hours 18 universal time and here is the hour's top news 
story. President Clinton says the hardest decisions are now on the 
table at the Mid East summit and he wants Palestinian and Israeli 
leaders to make those decisions today. We'll have more on that story 
in a our news summary coming up in about 11 minutes. Time now for 
sports and Steve Shys joins us live here in the studio and I guess 
it's time to celebrate in New York.
