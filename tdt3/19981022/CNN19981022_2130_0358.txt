A new study is sending a wake-up call. What happens when patients 
are too sick to make their own life or death call? A form is being 
released to make that decision ahead of times call identify five wishes." 
It could be used as a living will. Joining us now is the president 
of the group, Jim tooey. Can you tell us what makes this different 
than any other living will? It helps people talk about personal and 
emotional and spiritual issues, such as how they want to be treated, 
how comfortable they want to be and whether they want people praying 
by their bedside holding their hand. This document helps them do that. 
This is a legal document, isn't it? it is. It sound tooz easy to be 
a legal document. This is a right that people have to a what kind 
of care they want when they're seriously ill and whether they want 
aggressive medical treatment withdrawn or withheld. It should be in 
people's language. It should be in words that people understand. And 
that's why five wishes has had such enormous appeal in Florida. How 
do you know it will be widely accepted in Florida? 30,000 Americans 
have asked to for it before it was released. We got doctors and professionals 
in care supporting what wire doing so we feel it will trigger a Lev 
lugs in America. You saw the way we changed the system of care for 
birthing mothers. In the past it was a gruesome procedure for women, 
and they demanded change. I think that will happen for families, too. 
You know there are states that won't accept it. This is available 
on a web site. That's right or people can contact us for the actual 
booklet. For the states where you can't use it because laws don't 
permit forms other than state forms, we hope it triggers debates so 
all 50 states can be five wishes states. We're thrilled with the interest 
so far. Jim, thank you for joining us this evening. We'd like everyone 
to know that the five wishes we have been discussing can be downloaded 
for free at the web site address www.agingwithdignity.org, or ask 
for one by mail --
