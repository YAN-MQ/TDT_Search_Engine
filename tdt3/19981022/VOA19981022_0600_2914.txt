And finally, with congressional and some local elections coming up 
next month, some political pollsters in the United States are looking 
to see if the Internet is a viable medium to gauge voter choices. 
According to "The New York Times," Harris Black International and 
Excite are conducting four on-line polls on the November 3 voting. 
The polls will track the sentiments of registered voters in senatorial 
and gubernatorial races in 16 states. The newspaper says that the 
Harris Company wants to determine whether Internet polls can approximate 
the accuracy of polls conducted by telephone. Using the Internet would 
be cheaper and less intrusive.
