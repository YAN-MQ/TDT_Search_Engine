Christie's was preparing to take bids on one of its rarest offerings: 
a one-of-a-kind copy of a 2,300-year-old text by the ancient Greek 
scientist and inventor Archimedes. Not so fast, Greek officials replied. 
The Greek culture ministry is investigating how the medieval manuscript 
came into the hands of its current owners following a mysterious journey 
from Middle Eastern monasteries to a family in France. ``The origin 
of the manuscript is being examined,'' Milena Apostolaki, advisor 
to the culture minister, told The Associated Press on Thursday. The 
scheduled Oct. 29 auction New York is expected to fetch between dlrs 
800,000 and dlrs 1.2 million for the 174-leaf text, which includes 
writings on geometry and physics. But if the ministry's investigation 
can prove the item was not legally obtained, the auction could be 
called off. ``If there is absolute proof, we will not put it up for 
sale,'' said Vredy Lytsman, spokeswoman for Christie's in New York. 
Any challenge to the ownership would have to be further investigated 
by the auction house, which has already conducted its own research 
into the origin of the manuscript, known as the Archimedes Palimpsest. 
A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages have been written on twice. 
When writing materials were in short supply, the original text would 
be washed away when no longer deemed useful. ``Christie's are satisfied 
that the Archimedes Palimpsest has been legitimately owned by a French 
family for the last three quarters of a century,'' said Felix de Marez 
Oyens, the head of Christie's Books and Manuscripts Department. But 
its earlier history is steeped in mystery. Archimedes' text was copied 
in Constantinople, modern-day Istanbul, in the 10th century. Two centuries 
later, it was covered by a Greek religious text but the original writings 
were still legible. In the Middle Ages, it was owned by a monastery 
in Palestine whose manuscript collection was incorporated into the 
Greek Patriarchate library in Jerusalem in the 19th century, de Marez 
Oyens noted. No one knows why it was transferred to another monastery 
in Constantinople. All but four ancient texts _ including the Archimedes 
volume _ were taken to Athens when the monastery's library was dissolved 
after World War I. The other three are now in libraries in France 
and the United States. The Archimedes text was the only one to become 
privately held. The manuscript ``is the most significant and substantial 
Greek palimpsest known, and one of the most important palimpsest manuscripts 
of a classical text ever to come to light,'' a Christie's statement 
said. For some Greek officials, the manuscript represents a cherished 
part of a cultural heritage that has been scattered across the globe 
_ such as the Elgin marbles taken from the Parthenon in the 19th century 
and now on display at the British Museum in London. ``(The manuscript's) 
acquirement by Greece has symbolic, political and scientific value 
and I believe we must attempt it,'' said Culture Minister Evangelos 
Venizelos, who has appealed to large Greek banking groups and charitable 
foundations to contribute to help make a winning auction bid. Archimedes, 
who explored physics, astronomy and engineering, is credited with 
shouting ``Eureka!'' or ``I've found it?'' while running naked through 
the streets after discovering the principle of water displacement 
while sitting in his bath. He also has been cited for inventions such 
as a planetarium that demonstrated the movement of the stars, the 
compound pulley and devices for raising water. The manuscript contains 
``the only known copy of the original Greek text of his work `On Floating 
Bodies,''' Christie's said. It also contains works such as ``On the 
Measurement of the Circle'' and ``On the Sphere and the Cylinder'' 
and ``On Spiral Lines.'' The fact that the text has not been accessible 
to study for nearly a century adds to its significance. Modern methods, 
such as high-resolution digital scanning and ultraviolet light, could 
reveal previously unnoticed details and text, Christie's noted.
