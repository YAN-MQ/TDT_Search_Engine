A bank employee said Thursday that he was fired after admitting his 
part in disclosing that President Franjo Tudjman's wife has undeclared 
bank assets, a revelation that has caused a nationwide stir. Robert 
Horvat, a 32-year-old decorated veteran of the Serbo-Croat 1991 war 
told state-run news agency HINA that he willingly confirmed another 
employee's claims that Tudjman's wife, Ankica, had deposited dlrs 
140,000 in Zagrebacka Banka last March. Reports about the amount, 
and the fact that Tudjman did not declare it in a recent mandatory 
financial disclosure, has stirred outrage in Croatia, where most people 
make less than dlrs 500 a month. Tudjman reported that his spouse 
had no considerable valuables apart from a car. Last week Ankica Lepej, 
a 50-year-old clerk at the bank, told the daily Jutarnji list about 
the money. At the bank's request, police subsequently began a criminal 
investigation into whether Lepej and other bank employees broke confidentiality 
rules. Horvat said police interrogated him on Tuesday and that he 
was fired from the bank 24 hours later. Police also have interrogated 
Lepej, as well as two reporters and the chief editor of the newspaper. 
The affair is a hot topic in Croatia, where independent papers have 
for years claimed that Tudjman and his associates enriched themselves 
through corruption and shadowy deals. The scandal is a heavy blow 
to the president, whose popularity is fading mainly due to an increasing 
gap between rich and poor in Croatia. Tudjman's legal experts have 
claimed he did not have to declare liquid assets.
