Malaysia is making a serious bid to play host to the 2008 Olympic 
Games, a senior sports official said Thursday. Deputy Sports Minister 
Loke Yuen Yow told Parliament a special committee had been formed 
to study whether Malaysia could stage the world's biggest sporting 
event, the national news agency Bernama reported. He said local sports 
officials would visit the International Olympic Committee headquarters 
in Switzerland next month to study bidding procedures and seek advice 
from Olympic board members. ``If we can successfully organize the 
Commonwealth Games, I believe we can also organize the Olympic Games,'' 
Loke said, referring to the 10-day event Malaysia staged last month 
for 360 million ringgit (dlrs 95 million). The Commonwealth Games 
committee said earlier it expected to make a profit of 5 million ringgit 
(dlrs 1.5 million) after building and upgrading sports arenas, including 
the main stadium, which cost dlrs 300 million to build. The infrastructure 
is mostly in place and only minor upgrading to Olympic standards would 
be needed, Loke said. He acknowledged profits from staging such an 
event would be minimal, but said the Olympics would burnish the country's 
image and boost tourism. Such sporting events would also enhance ``the 
feeling of patriotism which is important to racial unity'' in multi-ethnic 
Malaysia, he said. Malaysia is making a bid to stage the Asian Games 
in 2006.
