Fighting between government forces and rebels in Guinea-Bissau abated 
Thursday, allowing aid workers to address the mounting humanitarian 
crisis in the small west African nation. The government announced 
a unilateral cease-fire late Wednesday. The insurgents reacted cautiously, 
saying they wanted guarantees before entering into peace talks. It 
was not immediately clear whether they also had opened a truce. Aid 
workers contacted by phone said the capital Bissau and second-largest 
city Bafata, 140 kilometers (90 miles) to the east, were quiet after 
sporadic firing at dawn. The Red Cross and World Food Program said 
they were struggling to care for tens of thousands of people fleeing 
the fighting in the former Portuguese colony of some 1 million people. 
``We're completely overwhelmed by the situation,'' Wagdi Othman of 
the WFP said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, from where he is coordinating 
the aid effort. Some 1,000 people, including about 300 children, sought 
refuge in the Notre Dame de Fatima missionary compound in Bissau where 
there was no food or medicine, Othman said. A further 5,000 gathered 
at an Italian mission in the city, he said. Michael Kleiner of the 
International Red Cross said thousands of people were streaming out 
of the capital. About 20,000 people arrived in Cumara, a small town 
12 kilometers (seven miles) from Bissau. Many civilians were wounded 
in an artillery barrage by government forces in Bissau on Wednesday, 
Kleiner said. ``We have urged both sides to be very careful with targets, 
but of course it's very difficult to escape civilian casualties in 
fighting in cities,'' Kleiner said from the Red Cross headquarters 
in Geneva. The rebels Thursday were advancing on Gabu, about 200 kilometers 
(125 miles) east of Bissau, according to aid workers who asked not 
to be identified. The insurgents _ mostly army veterans angered by 
poor pay and conditions _ control most of the country after sweeping 
through the countryside since fighting restarted on Sunday, ending 
a three-month truce. They have been fighting about 3,000 heavily-armed 
Senegalese troops who crossed over the border to support President 
Joao Bernardo Vieira when the military rebellion began June 7. The 
foes had entered a cease-fire July 26 brokered by negotiators from 
west African and Portuguese-speaking countries. The mediators discussed 
the deployment of a peacekeeping force and military observers, but 
no deal was reached.
