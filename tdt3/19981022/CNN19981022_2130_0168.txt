In Illinois, organized labor is trying to make a difference for the 
democrats. John king has details. Reinforcements for a friend in need, 
as organized labor gets back to basics in campaign '98. I'd like to 
introduce congressman Lane Evans. The eight-term democrat is as low-key 
as they come, but grateful for the help of young democrats bused in 
courtesy of the afl-cio. We have a very tough congressional race here 
and you can make a big difference by being out here today. Evans won 
with just 52% two years ago and is in a tight rematch with republican 
Mark Baker. Hello. Baker for Congress. Except for the occasional lawn 
sign, there is little evidence here that people are paying much attention 
-- or care much -- about this year's elections. Turnout is sure to 
be low, and in close elections like this one, labor is banking on 
its ground game to make a difference. Jim Reed is the face of that 
new strategy here in western Illinois, hired by labor to turn out 
the vote the old-fashioned way. Okay, we go to 616 and 630 next. It 
is tedious, thankless work, often an uphill struggle to gin-up voter 
interest. Are you familiar with Lane? A little bit, not much. These 
veteran union members say helping Evans is well worth their time and 
effort. He's been with labor and the working people all his life, 
and I think if we don't reiterate our end of that and come back and 
help him, we're shooting ourselves in the foot. So volunteers are 
Manning union phone banks nightly through election day, hoping that 
personal contact might make the difference. We're calling to see if 
you're familiar with Lane Evans. John king, CNN, rock island, Illinois.
