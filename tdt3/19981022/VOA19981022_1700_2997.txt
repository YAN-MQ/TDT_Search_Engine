Industrial giant 3M posted third quarter sales and profits lower than 
they were this time last year and also projected flat earnings for 
the next quarter due to weaker sales in Asia and Latin America. Also, 
Chevron joined the list of US oil companies reporting losses because 
of low crude oil prices. However, the impact of corporate reporting 
was eased somewhat by lower expectations on Wall Street. Analyst also 
say there is underlying strength in the US market. Recent gains were 
spread out more broadly among smaller and medium size stocks. Elaine 
Johanson, VOA News, New York.
