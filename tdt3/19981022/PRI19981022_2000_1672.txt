One final piece of electronic business news before we go. In America, 
the Internet and E-mail are clearly an everyday part of life, but 
it's more unusual to have access to the World Wide Web in Ghana. So 
one company's come up with a solution. Africa Online has set up an 
exclusive deal with local post offices where E-mails can be sent or 
received for a small fee. More Ghanaians can now get their own E-mail 
address. One thing, of course, they'll have to go to the post office 
to send or collect them. That's THE WORLD business this Thursday. 
I'm Patrick O'Connell in New York.
