Senator John Glenn will have one less task during his stay aboard 
"Discovery" next week. Glenn who is 77 will not participate in a portion 
of a scheduled sleep study that will involve the hormone melatonin. 
The scientist who will supervise the experiments, says Glenn failed 
to meet one of the medical criteria set by the food and drug administration. 
NASA officials deny they were not forthright with that information. 
There has been no attempt at all to hide the fact that senator Glenn 
would not be participating in the melatonin portion of this study. 
This information first became available in the late August time framework 
and this type of information is such that we don't normally share 
this information with the external sources, unless we're asked specifically 
about information like this. NASA has not revealed which medical criteria 
brought about the change in plans.
