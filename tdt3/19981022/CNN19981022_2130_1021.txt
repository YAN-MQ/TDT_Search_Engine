Air travelers have dozens of airlines to choose from, all competing 
to have the best fares. But options haven't always been the name of 
the game. Stephanie Oswald has the story in this "working ahead." 
In the late 70s, airlines such as Pan Am, eastern and braneth ruled 
the skies. The civil aeronautics board governed the airlines, controlling 
routes and ticket prices, keeping fares high and eliminating competition. 
During the Carter administration the C.A.B. was led by this man, Alfred 
kahn, known as the "architect of deregulation." Nobody could fly an 
airplane commercially on any route without specific permission from 
the civil aeronautics board. And price competition, cutting prices, 
was illegal. Kahn's crusade let the marketplace, not government, set 
prices and competition. The result, the airline deregulation act of 
1978, signed into law by President Carter. With this act, airlines 
can reduce their fares up to 50%, opening up air travel to millions 
of Americans who would not otherwise be able to afford it. The department 
of transportation became the industry watchdog. And airlines took 
control. Over the last 20 years, prices have fallen. When you take 
into account inflation by about one-third. And travel has doubled. 
But no new airline has taken off in the last two years. It's bad for 
consumers. And it's bad particularly for business people 'cause business 
people's fares have increased dramatically in the last two years. 
Is it survival of the fittest? Over 600 million people a year traveling. 
The reason for that is the competitive nature of the industry. And 
I think that the facts speak for themselves. It's competition that 
may or may not make the flying public a Winner as we fly into the 
21st century. Stephanie Oswald, CNN, reporting.
