Glasgow Rangers, seizing on two mistakes, beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 
Thursday in a second-round first-leg UEFA Cup match. The Rangers led 
2-0, but a desperate late attack by the host Germans was capped by 
subsitute Thomas Reichenberger's short-range goal seconds before the 
final whistle. After a slow first half, Dutch international Giovani 
van Bronckhurst slotted in the first goal for the Rangers in the 45th 
when the Germans' offsides trap backfired. Jonatan Johnasson guided 
the 2-0 goal into a wide-open net in the 64th as he and Rod Wallace 
beat the German team back on a counter, then fooled the keeper. The 
Scottish team, which invested heavily in foreign stars But for this 
season, eked out few other scoring chances in a lackluster match. 
The goals were the first ever for the Rangers in a German stadium, 
having four times come up empty-handed in previous international matches. 
Leverkusen, a Champions Cup quarterfinalist last season, was harmless 
without injured German national team striker Ulf Kirsten until stung 
by the second goal. Subsitute Nico Kovac struck the crossbar with 
a powerful blast. Minutes later, Dutch striker Erik Meijer scored 
off his heel, but was denied on a questionable off-sides call. Glasgow 
defender Colin Hendry then stopped another goal by clearing with his 
body on the line after Reichenberger tried from short range. But Reichenberg, 
with five minutes to play, connected on his second try from close-in 
after Brazil's Ze Roberto lifted a pass over the Scottish defenders' 
heads.
