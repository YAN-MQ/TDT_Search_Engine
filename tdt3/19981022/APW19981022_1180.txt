Hector ``Macho'' Camacho, a champion in three weight classes, has 
plenty of confidence heading into his junior middleweight fight Friday 
night against Kenny Sigurani. ``I'm in good shape, and have been doing 
a lot of roadwork, so I don't have any worries,'' said Camacho, who 
is 66-4-1 with 33 knockouts. ``I'll do what I do best.'' No titles 
are at stake in the scheduled 10-round bout at the Mountaineer Race 
Track and Gaming Resort. The 36-year-old Camacho, a former WBC super 
featherweight and lightweight and WBO welterweight champion, last 
fought on Aug. 11, winning a 12-round unanimous decision over Tony 
Menefee. A year ago almost to the day, Camacho's son, Hector Camacho 
Jr., 20, won a junior welterweight bout at the Chester racetrack, 
with his father at ringside. The younger Camacho also is scheduled 
to fight Friday night, but at Trump Marina in Atlantic City, New Jersey 
in a scheduled 10-round junior welterweight fight against Fred Curiel. 
The 25-year-old Sigurani (22-2) knows he is the underdog against the 
elder Camacho and has been putting in extra time in the gym to make 
the fight a ``more even match.'' ``I have everything to gain and nothing 
to lose,'' said Sigurani, a Youngstown, Ohio native. ``I want to go 
on and go farther. It's hard to step in the ring with these guys, 
I've been looking up to them forever _ but I'm here to work and work 
hard to get ahead.'' Sigurani's closest brush with fame of late was 
a June 25 welterweight fight with Julio Cesar Chavez. He cut Chavez 
badly over the right eye before he lost when stopped in the third 
round.
