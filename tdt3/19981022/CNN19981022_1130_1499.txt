Teeming crowds, bustle and noise. It's an image that tends to spring 
to the minds of most people who have ever visited India. But there's 
another side of this ancient country that has been captured in the 
luxurious tranquility of one world-class hotel. Anita Pratap has more. 
a magical night. Indian classical music and dance in a palace fort. 
With soft lighting that enhances the beauty of the architecture. Showcasing 
the romantic ambience of a bygone era is this hotel called Raj vilas, 
or abode of kings. This hotel re-creates an epic India, which is historical 
and magical and that's the reason one comes here. Over the years, 
the quality of tourists has deteriorated and this is an endeavor to 
get the more upmarket tourist to come to India. Air-conditioned, deluxe 
tents cost $300 a night. The royal Villa with its exclusive decor 
and private swimming pool a steep $1,000 a night. Spread over 30 acres, 
the hotel is located in jaipur city in the desert state of rajasthan, 
one of India's most exotic tourist destinations. This is a land of 
kings and noblemen, palaces and forts, peacocks and camels. And above 
all, it is a land of exquisite craftsmanship. Some of that craftsmanship 
can be seen in the hotel. The handmade blue tiles, the carved, brass-studded 
doors. The artwork on the walls that re-create the opulent lifestyle 
of kings. You really feel like you're being treated like royalty in 
the hotel. You are not going to see something like this anywhere else. 
And the attention to detail is pretty remarkable, it really feels 
like something that was built a couple of hundred years ago. It was 
actually built less than a year ago. There is a temple in the premises 
that is at least 250 years old and the spa is located in an ancient 
mansion that has been extensively renovated. As I always say, the 
hospitality industry is show business. I don't think many people understand 
that and this is what we are trying to create. A showpiece for the 
world to see. a showpiece that provides a completely different image 
of India. Anita Pratap, CNN, jaipur.
