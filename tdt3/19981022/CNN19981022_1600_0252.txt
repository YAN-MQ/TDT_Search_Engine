An environmental group has claimed responsibility for seven fires 
set monday in vail, Colorado. The earth liberation front says it set 
buildings and ski lifts on fire because it did not want the vail mountain 
ski resort to expand. The fires caused $12 million in damage, and 
could be the costliest act of environmental sabotage in U.S. history. 
The earth liberation front has been linked to arson fires across the 
northwest.
