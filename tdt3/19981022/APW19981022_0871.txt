Despite an economic crisis, disappointing harvest and forecasts of 
a particularly frigid winter, Russia's finance minister said Thursday 
the country does not yet need foreign food or other humanitarian aid. 
At the same time, Mikhail Zadornov expressed hope that more cold, 
hard cash will be forthcoming from the International Monetary Fund. 
However, Zadornov's deputy said that was unlikely to happen because 
the Russian government still has no long-term plan for coping with 
the latest economic crisis that erupted in mid-August. The Russian 
government has appealed for humanitarian aid from the European Union 
and is holding talks with the United States for subsidized grain. 
But Zadornov suggested such plans were premature. ``Russia's financial 
situation is not such that it requires direct humanitarian aid,'' 
Zadornov told reporters. ``I would express gratitude for such proposals, 
but I think that food imports will continue on the normal market basis.'' 
Zadornov said he hoped a visiting IMF team would recommend disbursing 
more of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package negotiated before the crisis 
hit. It was frozen in September after the first dlrs 4.8 billion installment 
was paid. ``I think that our partners can't but recognize that the 
government is taking strong efforts to radically cut spending,'' he 
said in a reference to a fourth-quarter budget plan approved by the 
Cabinet on Tuesday. The IMF's chief representative in Moscow, Martin 
Gilman, told Russian news agencies that the question of further loan 
installments had not come up in the talks. He did not say what they 
were talking about. Zadornov's deputy, Oleg Vyugin, said that the 
lack of a more comprehensive economic plan through the end of 1999 
would hamper the talks with the IMF. ``It is very important to the 
IMF what kind of budget Russia will have in 1999,'' Vyugin said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. ``The Fund wants to understand whether 
it will be a leap into the abyss or over the abyss.'' Zadornov said 
the government hoped to finish its draft 1999 budget by mid-November. 
The Russian government has said it is counting on IMF money to help 
pay its bills for the rest of the year. It plans to spend 130 billion 
rubles (dlrs 7.6 billion) in the final three months of the year, but 
expects revenues of only around 70 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion). 
It is planning to print more rubles to cover at least some of the 
shortfall. Zadornov said it might also raise money by increasing excise 
taxes by 25 percent or selling 5 percent of its shares in the national 
gas monopoly, Gazprom. ``We will certainly be forced to print new 
money to finance our spending,'' Zadornov said. ``There is no sense 
in concealing it, but we must keep it to a minimum.'' Former Prime 
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko noted that an increase in the money supply 
will lead to high inflation, and said the government should concentrate 
instead on cutting spending and boosting tax collection. ``If water 
is pouring from your faucet, you should close it, not wipe the water 
from the floor,'' he said on Echo Moscow radio. Zadornov insisted 
that no matter how hard-pressed the government is, it will pay its 
foreign debts, although he indicated Russia may try to renegotiate 
the payment schedule. He said Russia has already paid dlrs 500 million 
interest on its foreign debt this quarter and plans to spend another 
dlrs 2 billion.
