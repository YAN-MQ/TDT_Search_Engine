The Islanders couldn't keep out of the penalty box, and as a result, 
couldn't keep the puck out of their net. After giving up two power-play 
goals early in Wednesday night's game, the Islanders lost focus, then 
lost to the Edmonton Oilers, 4-2, before another sparse crowd at Nassau 
Coliseum. The attendance figure was not announced, but there appeared 
to be fewer than 3,000 fans in the seats, an embarrassingly small 
number even on a night when the Yankees won the World Series. At the 
start of the third period, the Islanders were losing, 3-0, but managed 
to make a game of it late, cutting their deficit to 3-2 on goals by 
Trevor Linden and Kenny Jonsson. But the Oilers (3-3) got an empty-net 
goal from Boyd Devereaux, his second score of the game. ``I thought 
we had good jump at the start of the game,'' said Mike Milbury, the 
Islanders' coach and general manager. ``But when you have six minor 
penalties in the first few minutes, you can't get into any kind of 
a rhythm.'' The first period saw the Islanders (2-3) play their best 
hockey of this young season. But they left the ice down by 1-0, foiled 
by senseless penalties. After putting 10 quality shots on Oilers goalie 
Mikhail Shtalenkov, and getting as many quality saves from Tommy Salo, 
the Islanders found themselves in a four-on-three situation. Gino 
Odjick was in the penalty box for interference and Kevin Miller was 
called for a high stick. The result was a power-play goal by Pat Falloon. 
The penalties kept coming, and so did Oilers' goals. Bill Guerin scored 
another power-play goal at 7 minutes 5 seconds of the second period 
and Boyd Devereaux tallied the Oilers' third goal at 12:08 of the 
period at even-strength. While the absence of a respectable turnout 
probably did not contribute to Islanders' loss, it does take a toll 
on the players. ``It shouldn't bother us,'' said Claude Lapointe, 
``but sometimes its hard to play when you have five, six-thousand 
people.''
