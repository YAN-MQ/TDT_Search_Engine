The Colorado river is nearing its crest in Wharton, Texas, a town 
55 miles southwest of Houston. Near San Antonio, recovery crews pulled 
the bodies of four family members, including a 2-month-old girl, from 
a Creek today. The series of devastating rain storms that hit Texas 
has killed 26 people statewide, and more than a dozen remain missing. 
20 counties have been declared disaster areas, and damage estimates 
are topping $1 billion.
