The international accounting firm Price Waterhouse Coopers won a tender 
to audit Ukraine's telecommunications monopoly in preparation for 
its planned privatization, officials said Thursday. The company is 
to prepare a financial report on Ukrtelecom for the first half of 
the year, and then for the full year, Ukrtelecom said in a statement 
cited by the Interfax news agency. Price Waterhouse Coopers is to 
begin work with Ukrtelecom at the end of October and plans to complete 
the audit next May, Ukrtelecom said. Other participants in the tender, 
which was announced last July, included the firms Arthur Andersen, 
Deloitte and Touche, Ernst and Young and KPMG. The audit of Ukrtelecom 
is part of Ukrainian government's plan to prepare the fully state-owned 
giant for privatization. President Leonid Kuchma said earlier this 
week the Cabinet was about to submit to parliament a bill permitting 
the privatization of Ukrtelecom. The legislature needs to approve 
the measure because under the current law, telecommunications companies 
in Ukraine are barred from privatization. Ukrainian Prime Minister 
Valery Pustovoitenko has said the government hopes to raise at least 
dlrs 2 billion from selling a 25 percent stake in the telecommunications 
firm. Ukrtelecom includes 35 subsidiaries and 738 branches throughout 
Ukraine, and owns large stakes in five joint ventures. The company 
employs 130,000 people.
