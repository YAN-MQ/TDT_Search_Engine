The British are spending time this week remembering an old friend 
from a Long time ago. Wednesday, the restored memorial for prince 
Albert was unveiled after being shrouded in scaffolding for eight 
years. The monument was built for queen Victoria shortly after her 
husband died in 1861, after the British people raised money for it. 
Now Victoria's great-great-granddaughter, queen Elizabeth II, is calling 
the monument a triumph restored a year ahead of schedule and under 
budget.
