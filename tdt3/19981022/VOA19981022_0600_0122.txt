France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrin, says conflict could flare 
up again in the entire Balkan region if NATO does not act resolutely 
to end the crisis in Kosovo. Mr. Vedrin warned that the alliance must 
keep up pressure on Yugoslav President Milosovic to continue the pullout 
of Serbian forces. The French foreign minister met Wednesday evening 
in Paris with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, who warned earlier of 
dramatic consequences if Mr. Milosovic does not comply with international 
demands to withdraw his forces.
