Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson met Thursday with bosses of the BMW-owned 
car manufacturer Rover Group over its decision to staunch heavy losses 
by axing 2,400 British jobs. BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder and 
Rover chairman Walter Hasselkus said they had not asked Mandelson 
to bail out the company during an hour of discussions at the Department 
of Trade and Industry in London. ``It was a good meeting.'' Pischetsrieder 
told reporters as he left. ``We informed the government of what the 
situation is.'' No one was immediately available for comment at Mandelson's 
office. BMW has set a six-week deadline for gaining union agreement 
to cut 2,400 jobs from Rover's 39,000 British workforce, mostly at 
the auto maker's giant Longbridge plant in Birmingham, central England, 
which employs 14,000 people. Several unions have held urgent talks 
with BMW to avert the closure of the Longbridge plant. ``Without major 
surgery to cut costs immediately, via significant job losses alongside 
cuts to employment-related and other costs, there will not be a supportable 
survival plan to place before the BMW board,'' the unions said Wednesday, 
adding that the future of the plant remained ``in the balance.'' The 
company has become more productive since BMW bought it from British 
Aerospace PLC in 1994, but the high value of the pound has made its 
automobiles far less competitive in other markets, while making imported 
cars cheaper for British consumers. Mandelson told the House of Commons 
on Wednesday that Rover's fate rested in its own hands. ``Ultimately 
it is for the company to rise to the challenge and to ensure that 
Rover continues to thrive in the global marketplace,'' Mandelson said.
