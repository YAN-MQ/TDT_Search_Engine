You know the old line that if you give enough monkeys enough typewriters 
-- or now, word processors and enough time -- they'll turn out a best-selling 
novel? Well, how about if they balance your check book or do your 
tax returns? We may be at the beginning of a major turn in math at 
Columbia University. NBC's Robert Bazell. Let's count. 1, 2, 3 -- 
3-year-olds and 4-year-olds at the buckle my shoe day care center 
in New York, doing something children everywhere do -- counting. Something 
so simple, yet experts believe it is a key part of the higher intelligence 
humans achieve and only comes as we learn language. But at Columbia 
University, two adult rhesus monkeys named rosencrantz and macDuff 
have dramatically changed that perception with an amazing demonstration 
they are actually counting. It tells us that numerical ability is 
clearly older than language, that it's an ancient skill. Researchers 
train the monkeys to touch screens with increasing numbers of objects. 
If they go correctly from one to four, they get a reward. The scientists 
mix up the images to be sure it is really numbers the monkeys understand, 
not sizes or shapes. Then the scientists present monkeys with even 
larger numbers. The monkeys get it touching the numbers in sequence. 
Six then seven and so on. This shows us that numbers are a real meaningful 
dimension for the monkeys, that it's not artificial, that in their 
everyday lives they probably use numbers. The new research is not 
just about how animals think. It also provides new clues about how 
humans learn. In fact, most children do not learn to count as well 
as the monkeys until they are 2 years old or 3 years old. But new 
studies are showing that young children, like the monkeys, understand 
the concept of numbers far earlier than anyone thought. 12-month-old 
Lilly abrams cannot talk yet. But when a researcher at New York University 
puts one cookie in one container, two in the other, Lilly clearly 
understands which has more. There is an expectancy that the baby's 
mind is really minimal. But there's a lot more going on in their mind 
than we thought before. The new research shows that both babies and 
monkeys are born with the ability to understand numbers, that the 
animal and human brains are far more similar and programmed with greater 
ability than anyone ever knew. Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
