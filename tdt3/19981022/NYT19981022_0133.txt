Open positions on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 1.4 percent 
last month, to 4.15 billion shares, the exchange reported Wednesday. 
On the smaller American Stock Exchange, uncovered short sales decreased 
by 4 percent, to 195.4 million shares. Open positions of short sales 
are those shares that have been borrowed and sold, but not yet covered 
by repurchase. If the share price falls, an investor can profit by 
buying shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed ones. On the 
Big Board, the short interest figure for the month ended Oct. 13 was 
equal to 1.7 percent of the total shares listed on the exchange. Royal 
Dutch Petroleum shares had the largest increase in short interest 
on the Big Board. The number of shares sold short totaled 41.4 million, 
compared with 6.5 million the previous month. The biggest decrease 
in Big Board short interest was for shares of Tyco International Ltd., 
which fell to 8.4 million, from 26.7 million the previous month. An 
increase in the short position in a company's shares may indicate 
a rise in bearish sentiment among investors toward that company. But 
a short position could also increase because of complex trading strategies, 
especially those related to arbitrage activity.
