From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Ann Taylor. It 
appears that agreement may be near on a land for security plan in 
the Middle East. The State Department spokesman reports progress and 
says it's a serious moment of serious bargaining on serious issues. 
President Clinton arrived around midday in Eastern Maryland where 
he has been meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, and U.S. Diplomat 
Dennis Ross are involved. And for the second time, Jordan's King Hussein 
took part in the talks. Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton indicated 
he would like to see the work finished by day's end saying the tough 
issues are on the table.
