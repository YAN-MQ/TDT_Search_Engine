A coalition of civil liberties groups today filed suit in federal 
court to try to stop a new federal law aimed at curtailing access 
to pornography on the Internet. NPR's Eric Westerville reports. A 
coalition led by the American Civil Liberties Union includes booksellers, 
media outlets, and medical professionals. They charge that the newly 
enacted Child Online Protection Act could be used to suppress Internet 
discussion of such topics as reproductive rights, sexuality, AIDS, 
or the arts. The new law regulates data given away free of charge 
on commercial Internet sites and is intended to stop children from 
gaining access to materials deemed inappropriate. There are exemptions 
for material with redeeming social, political, or artistic value, 
but the ACLU charges that the law suppresses free speech because it 
could end up criminalizing the posting of information that has a legitimate 
use for adults. The coalition is part of a group that helped fight 
the Communications Decency Act which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned 
last year. Eric Westerville, NPR News, Philadelphia.
