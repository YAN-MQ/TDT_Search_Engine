Japan's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co., said Thursday it 
lost dlrs 1.76 billion in the first half of fiscal 1998 as global 
financial turmoil took a toll, especially on its overseas operations. 
Two other Japanese brokerages also reported losses, although on a 
smaller scale than Nomura's. Nomura posted a group loss of 207.2 billion 
yen (dlrs 1.76 billion) for the half year ended Sept. 30, compared 
to a net profit of 49.71 billion yen (dlrs 422 million) in the same 
period a year earlier. After the results were released, Nomura President 
Junichi Ujiie announced large-scale restructuring measures that include 
job cuts, consolidation of international operations, and reductions 
in executives' salaries. Nomura said the company lost about dlrs 600 
million on Russian bonds and another dlrs 600 million on U.S. mortgage-backed 
securities. The parent company also had a 33.72 billion yen (dlrs 
288 million) valuation loss on its domestic securities holdings for 
the six months. Although Nomura expects no further losses from the 
Russian market, a Nomura official said the outlook for U.S. mortgage-backed 
securities is ``severe,'' and Nomura hopes for an orderly reduction 
of its assets in this sector. Under the company's restructuring plan, 
Nomura intends to cut costs at its overseas operations by 20 percent. 
It also plans to inject dlrs 1.2 billion in capital into its U.S. 
unit, Nomura America Holding Inc. Ujiie told reporters that Nomura 
will cut 2,000 jobs through hiring freezes or early retirement by 
the year 2001. Kyodo News service said the cuts would likely affect 
Nomura's U.S. and British subsidiaries. The Nomura president also 
said that previously independent trading and investment banking operations 
around the world would in the future be controlled in Tokyo. That 
will allow the parent company to deal more successfully with unpredictability 
in emerging markets, such as the financial crisis that erupted in 
Russia, Ujiie said. The company will also scale down or withdraw from 
some of its overseas proprietary trading, such as in Russian bonds, 
Ujiie said. By restructuring, Ujiie said Nomura hopes to achieve group 
pretax profit of 240 billion yen (dlrs 2.03 billion) in the fiscal 
year ending March 2001. Japan's second- and third-largest securities 
companies also announced big losses Thursday. Daiwa Securities Co. 
posted a group net loss of 66.84 billion yen (dlrs 568 million) for 
the half-year, compared to a net profit of 15.53 billion yen (dlrs 
132 million) last year. Nikko Securities, Co. suffered a group net 
less of 57.72 billion yen (dlrs 491 million) compared to a net profit 
of 283 million yen (dlrs 2.4 million) a year earlier.
