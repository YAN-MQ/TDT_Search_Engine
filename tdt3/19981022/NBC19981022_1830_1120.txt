One of this country's premiere ski resorts is looking at a very grim 
situation tonight, just two weeks before the scheduled opening of 
what was supposed to be a banner season. But now three buildings and 
four chair lifts at vail are in ruins, burned in an arson fire. And 
a little-known environmental group says they did it. why? Here's NBC's 
Roger O'Neil. If the fires on vail mountain were set by environmental 
extremists, as the radical earth liberation front, elf, claims it's 
the nations costliest act of environmental terrorism. The fires were 
suspicious from the minute they were reported. 4:00 A.M. Monday morning, 
not one, but seven different fires along a mile and a half long Ridge 
at the very top of vail mountain. $12 million in damages. Today a 
federal ATF confirmed it was arson. We have eliminated what we classify 
as any and all accidental causes. Perhaps most disturbing sent last 
night from the shadowy group elf -- the storm clouds over vail this 
summer weren't just bad weather. The biggest ski resort in the country 
wants to get bigger, with new ski runs into this rugged back country. 
But numerous mainstream environmental groups say no. Rocky Smith says 
this is vital terrain for the elusive lynx, even though the animal 
hasn't been seen in Colorado for 30 years. Why can't we set aside 
a small area, perhaps 15,000 acres for nature? How much is enough, 
if we're not going to stop their expansion desires now, then when? 
When is this going to end? Just two weeks ago, a federal judge refused 
to stop vail from starting the expansion. The FBI is now investigating 
the veil fires. The earth liberation front has claimed other fires. 
Fire bombings of federal and private buildings in Washington and Oregon. 
The release of mink from fur farms in Wisconsin and Canada. No one 
claims to know who belongs or heads E.L.F., but other radical environmental 
groups defend their acts of sabotage. Federal prison time, jail sentences, 
any type of conviction or arrest is not a deterrent for compassionate 
committed people who want to see this habitat preserved for the lynx. 
With the world skiing championships scheduled here in January and 
the Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2002, environmental extremism has 
been a Worry. With these fires it just got a little bit bigger. Roger 
O'Neil, NBC news, vail.
