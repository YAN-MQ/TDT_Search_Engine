Sick of hearing about iffy job prospects and ozone depletion in the 
1990s, a high school student named David (Tobey Maguire) is in love 
with the sugar-coated past. On his favorite old television show, Dad 
booms ``Honey, I'm home,'' and Mom wears a crinoline and pearls. The 
kids say ``Gee whiz!'' and the fire department rescues cats in trees. 
The teacher's desk is lined with apples, for this is a ``Father Knows 
Best'' clone with a vengeance. Who knew, while plotting to stay home 
from school and watch it in reruns, that this show's idea of family 
paradise would make it the great cultural madeleine of its time? One 
thing we did know eventually: those apples had worms. And Gary Ross' 
ingenious fantasy ``Pleasantville'' is about finding them. Ross' screenplay 
takes David and his sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), on a ``Back 
to the Future'' trip and into the midst of their favorite show, where 
he gets a headful of Brylcreem and she finds herself in saddle shoes. 
To their astonishment, they replace two actors on the program to become 
Bud and Mary Sue (aka Muffin) and act out stories that David, as a 
fan, already knows about. And they, like everyone around them, are 
in black and white. Entertaining as it is, ``Pleasantville'' has its 
own black-and-white side that extends beyond the visual. The teens 
from the '90s, especially Jennifer/Mary Sue, bring a missionary zeal 
to awakening the benighted '50s types from their slumber. They wind 
up introducing truth, art and passion into Pleasantville in ways that 
make color bloom selectively on townspeople who have turned three-dimensional. 
By the time these newly enlightened characters have been labeled ``coloreds'' 
and have stirred up a conservative backlash, the movie has seriously 
belabored its once-gentle metaphor and light comic spirit. Like ``The 
Truman Show,'' with which it overlaps a bit, ``Pleasantville'' has 
more inspired trickery than depth. But there's great fun in that trickery 
as the film begins, especially in the choice of Don Knotts as a mysterious 
wizard of the sitcom realm. Knotts plays the television repairman 
who is apparently drawn to David because the teen-ager knows so much 
about ``Pleasantville'' episodes. ``Hey, who did Muffin take to the 
masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?'' he quizzes 
David. (The answer: her father, of course. And he dressed as Prince 
Charming.) Pleased with David's answers, he offers him a brand new 
television remote control with extraspecial ``oomph.'' This is the 
device that strands David and Jennifer in the past, where the repairman 
still keeps an eye on them. ``I'm a little concerned by what I'm seeing 
in these reruns,'' he complains as the town begins to bloom. By then, 
townsfolk are shocked to see a double bed in the furniture store and 
new-found sexuality has started a real fire. In Pleasantville, where 
the temperature varies from 72 to 72, nothing so real has been seen 
before. Trying to rouse the firemen, David/Bud tries the only cry 
of alarm they know: ``Cat?'' Much of ``Pleasantville'' concentrates 
affectionately on the television-perfect family into which the teen-agers 
have been dropped. William H. Macy brings a funny, touchingly naive 
bombast to the father's role, while Joan Allen truly does bloom as 
the mother. Ms. Allen gives a lovely performance as a housewife who 
cares most about lavishing vein-clogging food on her family (``And 
of course, a ham steak!'' she declares at breakfast time) until that 
rogue color begins creeping in. When it arrives at that fateful night 
when Dad gets home to find no dinner, ``Pleasantville'' recapitulates 
the changing family atmosphere of baby boomers' after the ``Father 
Knows Best'' years. Ross, whose writing credits include the equally 
fanciful ``Big'' and ``Dave,'' makes his directing debut with a film 
that exerts extraordinary technical demands. Indeed, much of the interest 
here is in watching how the black-and-white scenes (filmed on color 
stock) begin to flower, often to the characters' embarrassment; once 
Ms. Allen's character changes, she fearfully hides her rosy face behind 
green-gray makeup. Jeff Daniels plays the soda shop proprietor who 
makes her blush and who himself blossoms at the discovery of art. 
Randy Newman's score is splendid, but it needn't have boomed so ecstatically 
at the sight of a van Gogh. Ms. Witherspoon turns in a deliciously 
naughty performance as the '90s renegade who loves shaking up Pleasantville, 
even if her own generation is also satirized here. (The film's '90s 
teen-agers treat ``Hey!'' as an interesting sentence.) J.T. Walsh, 
in one of his last roles, played the town's most repressive bully. 
And the film's unsung heroine is Jeannine Oppewall (``L.A. Confidential''), 
the production designer who wittily turns the fantasy of Pleasantville 
into an actual place. Watch the sidewalks crack and the skirts grow 
less poufy as reality sets in. Rating: ``Pleasantville'' is rated 
PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild profanity and 
sexual situations. PRODUCTION NOTES `PLEASANTVILLE' Written and directed
