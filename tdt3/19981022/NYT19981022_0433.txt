They won the World Series with their fifth-string left fielder, for 
goodness' sake. They won two huge games with a pitcher who had emerged 
from the roiling seas. Their World Series hero was underestimated 
by everybody, at the beginning. Their owner was a warm and fuzzy guy 
who disarmed everybody in the clubhouse with his moist eyes and his 
soft voice. ``Was George crying?'' people kept asking afterward. Yes, 
the old blunderbuss was misty, and there's nothing wrong with that. 
Was he brooding that he might be selling off his team to protect his 
heirs from inheritance taxes? He wouldn't say. But there's nothing 
wrong with getting weepy at the end of one of those landmark years 
when one team gets much of it right much of the time. The New York 
Yankees of 1998, under a patient and wise manager named Joe Torre, 
performed at such an exalted level that adults could tell the next 
generation, ``That's how you play the game of baseball.'' Matter of 
fact, that's how you do your homework. Do your job. Live your life. 
Pay attention to the details. Show respect for people around you. 
Enjoy yourself. ``This is why I came here,'' said Hideki Irabu, who 
never pitched in the post-season but smoked a cigar and smiled all 
the same. ``This is why I wanted to play for the Yankees. I wanted 
to wear the pinstripes and I wanted to wear a championship ring.'' 
What a clubhouse. Not a creep in it, all season long. There were grown-ups 
like Chili Davis and David Cone, who have been around, who know some 
stuff. On Wednesday evening, after they had fought off Kevin Brown 
for the second time in a week, they were chanting ``Dar-ryl! Dar-ryl! 
Dar-ryl''! and then they switched to ``Scot-tie Bro-sius! Scot-tie 
Bro-sius!'' honoring both their stricken pal and their poker-faced 
October hero. They sounded like high school kids who had won the regional 
finals. In the melee, there was a man lighting a cigar. ``Felicidades, 
hombre,'' I said. Congratulations, man. Pointing at the cigar, I asked, 
``Que tipo?'' What kind? ``Cubano,'' he said, holding out his hand. 
He had been saving the good stuff for the world championship. That 
was El Duque. They didn't have enough talent as it was, the poor Yankees, 
so they went out and signed a man who had sailed out of his own personal 
coventry back in Cuba, and in a stunningly short period of time got 
his body and his psyche together. When they needed a big victory in 
Cleveland, Orlando Hernandez was a blend of Luis Tiant and Satchel 
Paige and Juan Marichal. I never thought I'd ever hear Bob Sheppard 
introduce a player as ``El Duque,'' but on a warm October night I 
did. They all knew it was a special season, and they acted like adults, 
from George Steinbrenner to the cast of thousands who shared left 
field and never whined. (``You wouldn't dare,'' Davis said.) Steinbrenner 
said it was as good a team as he had seen. Torre said it was the best 
team he had seen in his 40 years of baseball. Cone said it takes a 
terrific team to battle through three levels of playoffs. Even with 
a few swigs of Champagne, they did not get giddy and proclaim themselves 
the kings of the world. They were respectful of Ruth and Gehrig, Mantle 
and Maris, Reggie and Catfish, Bench and Morgan. Was this the greatest 
team of all time? Does that matter? There were roughnecks back in 
the early part of this century who were as good as the evolution of 
the game allowed them to be. Ty Cobb. The Yankees of 1927 were fence-busters. 
The Cardinals of the '30s played with panache. The Big Red Machine 
of the '70s could steamroll you. Personally, I think the crusty 1961 
Yankees had the best single season I ever covered, or maybe that was 
because I was kid reporter out of college. Maris was a wonderful player, 
Elston Howard was in his prime, Whitey Ford and Luis Arroyo had career 
years. Oh, and don't forget Mickey and Yogi. You want the best team 
of all time? Do I really have to play this silly game? All right, 
I'll take my 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers, the team of my youth, the Boys 
of Summer, as Roger Kahn called them. In a perfect world, in the ultimate 
World Series, Jackie Robinson steals home on El Duque's windup. There, 
I said it. In the meantime, we should tell our children and our grandchildren 
about the 1998 Yankees, how good they were on the field, and how, 
when they won the World Series, they did not crow too much.
