A prosecutor on Thursday questioned a retired naval officer who is 
on trial for treason after giving a foreign environmental group information 
about how Russia disposes of nuclear wastes. Details of the proceedings 
against Alexander Nikitin, 46, are sketchy, because the judge has 
closed the court to the media and most other observers. But Nikitin 
and his lawyers said they were cautiously optimistic he would get 
a fair trial. Nikitin is accused of giving secret documents to a Norwegian 
environmental group, the Bellona Foundation, on the handling of nuclear 
waste and reactors in the Russian navy's Northern Fleet. Both Nikitin 
and Bellona say the information came from public records. Nikitin's 
lawyers also argue that he was charged under secret Defense Ministry 
laws, in violation of the Russian Constitution. Nikitin faces seven 
counts of treason. Prosecutors have asked that he be sent to prison 
for 12 to 20 years. ``I have a very good impression of today's proceedings,'' 
Yuri Schmidt, a defense lawyer, said after the third day of proceedings. 
Schmidt said prosecutor Alexander Gutzan ``asked very good and clear 
questions.'' He said he was impressed with the way both judge and 
prosecutor seemed to understand the case. ``I don't know how the case 
will end, but it is always pleasant to work with a judge who is able 
to get to the crux of the issue,'' he said. The first three witnesses 
are expected to be called Friday: Sergei Fillipov, a former employee 
of Bellona's Murmansk office, retired navy officer Yevgeny Chernov, 
and a third unidentified witness. Yuly Rybakov, a Russian lawmaker 
who observed the trial Tuesday and Wednesday, said Thursday that it 
seemed to be going well. ``I think the result will be a positive one 
and I think Nikitin will be freed,'' he said. ``I had the impression 
that the judge was being rather calm and was looking at the case from 
an independent point of view.''
