While cities in other parts of the world are trying to encourage bicycle 
commuting, China's capital is backpedaling. Bicycles long ruled the 
road in Beijing. But this week Beijing for the first time bowed to 
rising car traffic and declared one busy street a bicycle-free zone. 
Police said freeing East Xisi Street from bicycles would give cars 
an extra lane and untie daily traffic jams, Beijing newspapers reported 
on their front pages this week. Chinese, grown used to arbitrary rules 
and the rapid change of breakneck economic growth, were slightly bewildered, 
but mostly resigned to the ban. ``We used to be able to turn right 
here. It's not fair to cyclists, but it is a regulation and we have 
to abide by it,'' one young cyclist, who gave only his surname, Wang, 
said after two police officers turned him away Wednesday, when the 
ban started. East Xisi (pronounced shee-suh) was known until 1965 
as Horse Market Street after a Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) market. Today 
the street in central Beijing is lined with one-story shops and remnants 
of traditional courtyard houses with rounded tile roofs and gray brick 
walls. Up to 6,000 bicycles per hour traveled the street in peak periods, 
according to city statistics. The 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. ban forces them 
to detour down a nearby street, but gives East Xisi Street two lanes 
in each direction instead of one for cars and one for bikes. Beijing's 
9 million bicycles are still the most popular mode of transportation 
_ from one-speed black ``Flying Pigeon'' or ``Forever'' brand traditional 
bikes to newer models that are more sleek and sporty. The average 
Beijing resident cannot afford a car. Still, taxis, company cars and 
private vehicles owned by the newly affluent have crammed Beijing's 
streets in rising numbers in the last few years _ 1.2 million vehicles 
at last count. Cars often scoot into bike lanes to cut through traffic 
jams, forcing bikers to hug the curbs. Intersections are jammed with 
cars and bicycles all trying to slide through at once. Bicycles took 
over Beijing's flat streets from rickshaws in the 1950s, and except 
for overly packed public buses for the next couple of decades there 
were almost no motor vehicles. The government is trying to promote 
car ownership to boost the national auto industry while also trying 
to clean up severe air pollution. China's autos still do not have 
up-to-date pollution control devices, but new vehicle emission standards 
are planned in 2000. Police on Thursday refused to comment about whether 
other bike-free streets were planned. By Thursday morning, bicycle 
riders were still looking bewildered at East Xisi. A police officer 
with a bullhorn and two middle-aged women with red arm bands shouted 
orders to detour. A small blackboard propped up at the side of the 
street with a message in colored chalk announced the bike ban and 
added, `` Hope you will cooperate.''
