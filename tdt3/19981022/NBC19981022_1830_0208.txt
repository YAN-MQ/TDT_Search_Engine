was present so there would be no doubt why florence Griffith Joyner 
died. There was a partial obstruction of the airway resulting in a 
relative lack of oxygenation to the lungs. a lot was at stake. A legend,

throughout her career with rumors that she used performance-enhancing 
drugs. When she was found dead September 21st in her mission Viejo, 
California, home, the rumors resurfaced, speculation that banned substances 
may have contributed to her death. Rumors were put to rest today. 
Orange county California pathologists and doctors say she suffered 
an epileptic seizure as she slept and suffocated face down in her 
bed. Her condition was a congenital blood vessel abnormality. Toxicology 
reports determined that she had taken a couple of pain relief pills 
before she died. There was nothing unusual in terms of the presence 
of drugs. Florence Griffith Joyner was a unique athlete who combined

running outfits and six-inch nails set her apart. She became a role 
model for a generation of young athletes. My wife took a final, ultimate 
drug test, and it is what we also said. There is nothing there. Her 
world records still stand, and so does her reputation. As the U.S.
