Scientists in New Zealand are warning that the threat of a massive 
mud slide is growing at a volcano on the country's North Island. The 
Department of Conservation today released a report saying a very destructive 
mud slide is likely to occur on Mount Rayaful by the year 2005. The 
volcano last erupted in 1996, leaving tons of loose ash and other 
debris. A mud slide on the volcano in 1953 washed out a bridge and 
sent a passenger train into a river, killing 151 people.
