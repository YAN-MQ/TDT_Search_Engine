The Kremlin says President Boris Yeltsin's scheduled trip to Vienna 
next week is being cut back from two days to one. No reason was given. 
A spokesman denied the agenda had been cut back and said the visit 
had only been compressed. Mr. Yeltsin recently has been recovering 
from what doctors describe as bronchitis, and last week he cut short 
a visit to Central Asia. On Wednesday, the Russian leader underwent 
what a spokesman said was a routine medical exam. Doctors said his 
health had returned to normal.
