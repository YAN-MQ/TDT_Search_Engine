Marine police on Thursday resumed their search for passengers missing 
from a ferry boat that capsized in the Gulf of Thailand, killing at 
least three people. Two Australian women and a pregnant Thai woman 
are known to have died in the accident early Wednesday as the boat 
was traveling to Koh Tao, an island popular with young travelers. 
Two officials from the Australian Embassy's consular section who went 
to the scene confirmed the two women were Australians, said an embassy 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He identified one as 
Gabrielle Sandercock, and said the family of the second victim had 
asked that her name not be released. The ferry left Don Sak town in 
Surat Thani province, 530 kilometers (330 miles) south of Bangkok, 
at 11 p.m. Tuesday and capsized in rough seas at 4 a.m. Wednesday, 
said a marine police officer. An unknown number of passengers were 
missing and presumed dead. The officer, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said he suspected some passengers had not managed to escape 
the stricken vessel. Naval authorities believe the boat may have capsized 
because it was carrying a heavy load of construction materials in 
choppy waters. Search and rescue operations were suspended late Wednesday 
and for a few hours Thursday morning because of heavy rains, said 
the marine police. Col. Kriran Intrakaew, the police chief for Koh 
Samui, an island to which the survivors and the bodies were taken, 
told The Associated Press Wednesday night that a total of 18 passengers 
had been rescued, 10 of whom were hospitalized. The rescued including 
two Americans and two Swiss.
