A fire gutted a gem of Muslim architecture, the Palace of Musafirkhana, 
in Old Cairo on Thursday. The blaze began when residents set fire 
to piles of trash in front of the 18th-century Ottoman palace, police 
said. The wooden gate caught fire and the flames quickly spread to 
the palace. It took firefighters five hours to put out the blaze, 
which devoured the rich woodwork of the palace and left only the walls 
standing. Four neighboring apartments were also destroyed. Two firefighters 
were treated for smoke inhalation. People in low-income districts 
in Egypt often burn trash. The Musafirkhana was built in 1779-88 and 
is the birthplace of Khedive Ismail, the ruler of Egypt at the time 
of the construction of the Suez Canal. The palace featured windows 
of wooden screens overlooking a courtyard fountain, entire walls paneled 
with engraved wood, and a well where the royal family is said to have 
disposed of corpses after secret executions. But, as with many of 
Egypt's Islamic monuments, the building had been allowed to deteriorate. 
The government had allotted 15 million Egyptian pounds (dlrs 4.4 million) 
for its restoration, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said. The agency 
quoted the chief official for Islamic and Coptic Monuments, El-Sayed 
Abdullah el-Attar, as saying the palace would still be restored.
