Congo Kinshasa's allies say they'll launch an offensive against rebel 
strongholds in the east. After a one-day strategy meeting at Harari, 
President Robert Mugabi of Zimbabwe announced the plan, saying the 
allies have pledged their support to Congolese President Lauren Kabila 
and will not allow the Congo to fall into rebel hands. Defense analysts 
say the move is an escalation of the conflict and could spark a regional 
war.
