Marty Whitman _ undoubtedly the only person who ever called him Martin 
was his mother _ is on a crusade. The man who has made several fortunes 
betting on corporate lost causes has now taken on Japan, the epicenter 
of the Asian financial crisis. At a time when many foreign investors 
have bailed out, Whitman's Third Avenue Value fund has 11.4 percent 
of its net assets sunk into Japanese stocks, mostly insurance companies 
and Toyota Motor Corp. affiliates. But it was his ill-fated decision 
last summer to buy 50 million shares in the Long-Term Credit Bank 
of Japan, the symbol of the Japanese financial crisis, that awakened 
his zeal. With his Yale University rep tie perpetually askew and his 
shirt sleeves rolled to his elbows, Whitman, 74, looks like the Wall 
Street equivalent of John the Baptist, and his message is no less 
fiery. If Japan fails to come up with a rescue program for troubled 
companies, he warns, the country's financial and economic system will 
collapse and bring the rest of the world down with it. ``Unless Japan 
creates an environment in which bad loans can be worked out so that 
debtors are rehabilitated and creditors recover something, the bad-debt 
problem here is hopeless,'' he said. In the past, Whitman has run 
funds that did well by buying companies caught up in bankruptcy and 
later selling them for a big profit. And he thinks Japan would do 
well to imitate Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which 
gives distressed companies protection from creditors while they set 
their houses in order. ``Japan needs a Chapter 11 of some sort,'' 
he said. ``Japan is particularly suited to that kind of process because 
it calls for consensus and this is a consensual society, unlike the 
United States, where things tend to get adversarial.'' Alas, for all 
the urgency of his message, he is having a hard time persuading Japanese 
power brokers to listen to it. On a recent trip here, he held a series 
of meetings with financial executives, but the only politician who 
would give him the time of day was a senior researcher for the main 
opposition party. ``The nicest thing I have to say now is that I'm 
often wrong,'' he said wearily over a sushi lunch as he licked salmon 
roe from his fingertips. He certainly was wrong about Long-Term Credit 
Bank. In July, he bought the stock for $1 a share, figuring it could 
not go much lower. Its shares now trade at about 2 cents apiece, and 
Third Avenue has been bailing out, selling 49 million of its 50 million 
shares in recent weeks for a total loss of $46 million. ``Terrible 
mistake,'' Whitman mused. Last month, he took the unprecedented step 
of suing the bank in an American court for its plans to forgive $1.9 
billion in loans to three affiliates. After all, he said in the interview, 
``They're not running the bank for their borrowers.'' Or are they? 
Whitman said he was told during his meeting with Katsunobu Ohnogi, 
president of Long-Term Credit Bank, that debt forgiveness was ``a 
matter of tradition.'' ``He kept telling me that the relationship 
between the bank and its affiliates was like the relationship between 
a mother and her child,'' Whitman recalled. ``I finally asked him, 
`Don't children have any obligation to their mother?' '' A spokesman 
for Long-Term Credit Bank said the bank did not want to comment. Whitman 
says he was also was unsuccessful in pitching an idea to Tokio Marine 
and Fire Insurance, in which Third Avenue has a stake currently valued 
at $60 million, to pump up its flagging returns. Even so, he can take 
heart in some recent developments. The country's political opposition, 
sympathetic to his views, threatened to hold up passage of financial 
reform legislation if Long-Term Credit Bank insisted on adhering to 
its original plan. As a result, the government decided last month 
to nationalize Long-Term Credit Bank and forbid it from pursuing its 
debt-forgiveness plan. On Sept. 29, one of its affiliates, the Japan 
Leasing Corp., went bankrupt. Japan's major business federation, meanwhile, 
proposed something dear to Whitman's heart _ a tax break for Japanese 
companies that sell off their stakes in group companies. And despite 
his gloom while he was here _ ``The future looks rather discouraging 
to me,'' he said during lunch _ he did find a few sympathetic ears. 
Although Kiyoshi Sugawa, the opposition researcher, had to cut short 
his meeting with Whitman to deal with legislative battles, he said 
he found Whitman's proposals provocative. ``I think his ideas for 
attracting private investment capital to increase the depleted capital 
bases of some banks are very good,'' Sugawa said, though he confessed 
that he found some of Whitman's message too technical to understand. 
Is Whitman's campaign to play a role in Japan's financial changes 
quixotic? Asked whether he was aiming for a tombstone inscribed ``Marty 
Whitman, Japan's Savior,'' he answered: ``No! `Marty Whitman, Savior 
of the world.' '' Perhaps he was joking. But he cautioned against 
dismissing him. ``My wife is very involved in the whole human rights 
thing, and I used to always ask her why she was wasting her time,'' 
he said. ``Then the Berlin Wall fell, and Vaclav Havel was there on 
television thanking all the human rights groups and telling them that 
without them, none of it would have been possible.''
