From Atlanta, this is "Headline News." I'm David Goodnow. Negotiators 
in the mideast peace talks will see at least one more day of talks. 
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has withdrawn his threat 
to leave the summit at wye mills, Maryland. The talks are now expected 
to last into Thursday. And sources say a partial deal could be announced 
then. Palestinians say they have agreed to a comprehensive security 
plan. But so far there's little indication from the Israeli negotiators 
suggesting security demands have been met to their satisfaction. Without 
a specific Palestinian guarantee on the amendment of the palestinian 
charter at the Palestinian national council, without receiving an 
explanation or a program which satisfies us regarding the extradition 
of terrorists, there won't be an agreement. We were astonished to 
hear today that there are new Israeli security demands. I think that 
the Americans were surprised also. We think that internal political 
Israeli issues are overriding Israeli's consideration in this wye 
plantation talks. I hope that Mr. Netanyahu will overcome these pressures. 
Israel has released a statement, saying it wishes to achieve an agreement 
and hopes there is a similar desire on the Palestinian side.
