Second-seed Andre Agassi of the United States outplayed Magnus Norman 
of Sweden 6-2, 7-5 Thursday to advance to the quarterfinals of the 
dlrs 1 million Czech Indoor ATP tennis tournament. Agassi broke Norman's 
serve in the first and fifth game of the first set despite playing 
in a practice tempo. Norman improved his performance in the second 
set and both players held on to their serves until the tenth game, 
but Agassi finally managed to break the Swede and win the match in 
straight sets. Meanwhile, home favorite Martin Damm rallied to beat 
fourth seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. Kafelnikov, 
No. 10 in the world, broke Damm's serve in the fourth game and comfortably 
won the first set, but gradually grew nervous as Damm started to rush 
the net. Kafelnikov tried to stick to his aggressive tennis, but Damm, 
the only remaining Czech in the tournament, improved both his serve 
and returns and eventually won the match. ``It would be nice if I 
could repeat my 1996 result here, that is semifinals,'' Damm said 
after the match. In the next round, Damm will face Wayne Black of 
Zimbabwe who beat the 1996 Czech Indoor champion David Prinosil of 
Germany 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. Black, ranked 92nd on the ATP Tour, crushed 
the Czech-born Prinosil with a dashing serve, often faster than 200 
kilometers (125 miles) per hour. In other Thursday action, Andrei 
Medvedev of the Ukraine defeated third seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia 
6-4, 6-7 (4-7) 6-4, and Jan Kroslak of Slovakia downed Guillaume Raoux 
of France 7-5, 6-2.
