In the United States, stocks set a gaining pattern Wednesday that 
the markets haven't seen since last February. Prices rose for the 
sixth straight session, led by a better than expected earnings from 
computer software giant Microsoft. The Dow Jones industrial average 
was up 13 points at 8,519, while the broad market indicator, the S&P 
500, was up 6 points at 1,070. The technology-heavy NASDAQ composite 
index was 35 points higher at 1,675.
