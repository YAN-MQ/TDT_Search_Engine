National Basketball Association players are evaluating two strategies 
in their fight to oppose owners' demands to limit their salaries. 
The players' union will hold a meeting open to all NBA players later 
today in Las Vegas. The players will be asked to decide whether to 
continue with union negotiations or decertify the union and take the 
league to court. NBA superstars Michael Jordan, Scotty Pippin, and 
Carl Malone are among the players expected to attend, and assistant 
union director Herb Williams says their opinions will help shape the 
outcome of the meeting. We never had those players at the table before, 
and those players are the players that really pull this league. And 
so, you know, depending on what think and how they -- what the things 
that they say come out, they're going to sway a lot of players, and 
a lot of players going to know that those guys, the superstars, are 
in their corner. The NBA wants to limit players' salaries because 
it says too many of its teams are losing money. That's sports. I'm 
Jim Stevenson.
