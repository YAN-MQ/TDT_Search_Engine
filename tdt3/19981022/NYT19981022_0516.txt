All things considered, it was a pleasant day for Duffy Waldorf. His 
family enjoyed being at Walt Disney World. And Waldorf had a great 
time on the golf course. Shooting a nine-under-par 63, including six 
birdies on his first seven holes, Waldorf cruised to a three-stroke 
lead after Thursday's first round of the National Car Rental Golf 
Classic. Tiger Woods, Len Mattiace and Jesper Parnevik were in a three-way 
tie for second place at six under par, but Waldorf's opening round 
was so good, his peers wondered if he would ever stop making birdies. 
``A few more putts on the back nine, and he could have definitely 
broken 59,'' said Parnevik, who played with Waldorf on the Palm Course 
at Disney. ``He got off to an unbelievable start. He was definitely 
hot.'' Waldorf, Woods and Parnevik played on the Palm Course, while 
Mattiace played on the more difficult Magnolia Course. The players 
will switch courses Friday, and the final two rounds will be held 
on the Magnolia Course. Waldorf's round was even more impressive because 
the wind gusted up to 20 mph, making club selection difficult. But 
nothing seemed to bother Waldorf, and his putting was superb. Waldorf 
used a new putter Thursday, and it served him well. He made a 30-foot 
putt for birdie on No. 3, a 45-foot putt for birdie on No. 4 and a 
20-foot putt for birdie on No. 6. Needless to say, Waldorf plans to 
keep his new putter in the bag. ``It's a Zebra Tear Drop, and I was 
really rolling the ball nicely,'' he said of his new putter. ``I made 
putts and I haven't been doing that lately. It was a fun day to play. 
I don't know if everyone else was having fun, but I was.'' A 36-year-old 
native of California, Waldorf has just one PGA Tour victory, the 1995 
LaCantera Texas Open. However, with $285,952 in earnings this year, 
Waldorf is 102nd on the money list, safely among the top 125 who will 
automatically earn their tour cards for next year after this weekend's 
tournament. This is a high-pressure week for those fighting to stay 
in the top 125, or for those trying to make the top 30 on the money 
list who will qualify for next week's Tour Championship. But Waldorf 
is in a position to relax. And on Thursday, he played that way. ``Two 
years ago when I came here, I was 30th on the money list, and it was 
a tough week,'' Waldorf said. ``If Payne Stewart had won that week, 
he would have passed me on the money list and knocked me out of the 
Tour Championship. After I finished, we were at Disney, and I was 
making calls to see if Payne had won. It turns out Tiger won. But 
it was a harder way to spend at Disney.'' Waldorf's round was two 
strokes off the course record, a 61 shot by Mark Lye in 1984. After 
making the turn at six under par, Waldorf birdied No. 11, then made 
another birdie at No. 12 when he chipped in from 40 feet. His next 
birdie came at the par-5 No. 14, when he reached the green in two 
shots and two-putted. Waldorf went to 10 under par with a birdie at 
the par-3 No. 16, when he hit a 6-iron to 7 feet, then made the putt. 
But Waldorf finished with a bogey at No. 18 when his second shot missed 
the green, forcing him to chip on, followed by two putts. Waldorf 
was not certain he could hold off proven winners like Woods and Parnevik 
for another three rounds, but he was certain that he would have a 
good time. After Thursday's round, he was headed to Disney World, 
where else? ``I'm going with Tom Lehman,'' Waldorf said. ``People 
don't recognize us in our swimsuits. You see our bodies. They go, 
`Who are those guys?' We don't look like golfers. We don't look like 
athletes.'' As for Woods, he continued the consistent play he has 
shown all year, and he hoped that it would lead to a victory. Despite 
winning just once on the PGA Tour this year, Woods has more top 10 
finishes (12) than anyone else, and he hoped his luck might change 
this week. ``I am actually more satisfied this year than I was last 
year,'' said Woods, who had seven birdies and just one bogey on Thursday. 
``Even though I won a major last year, I would rather be more consistent. 
When you are more consistent, down the road, the wins will pile up.'' 
He added: ``This tournament is very special to me, because it was 
a tournament I won in '96, and I had to win in order to get into the 
Tour Championship. It was a great week. I still get good vibes when 
I come back here.''
