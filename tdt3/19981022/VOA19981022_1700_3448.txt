Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
two minute break, but we'll be back. This is VOA News Now. We're coming 
up on 22 hours universal time. That means we're saying good night 
to most of our listeners in the Middle East and North Africa. Thanks 
for being with us and tune in again tomorrow beginning at 4 hour universal 
time when VOA News Now resumes on 7.17, 11.965, and 15.205 megahertz 
short wave. If you happen to be listening in the Persian Gulf area 
now, we invite you to stay with us for another couple of hours on 
medium wave at 1548 kilohertz. And if you're listening in the eastern 
Mediterranean we'll be back on the air with VOA News Now 30 minutes 
from now on 1260 kilohertz medium wave. Here's a frequency change 
if you're looking listening in Africa, we're now going off 15.41. 
15.445, 15.58, and 17.725 megahertz short wave. We invite you to retune 
to 7.34 megahertz or any of our other remaining frequencies. Listeners 
in Europe, we are now going of WRN1 via Astra. We will resume broadcasting.
