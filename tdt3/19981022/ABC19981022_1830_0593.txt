Elsewhere in the country tonight, in Houston, a 17-year-old Olympic 
gold medalist and in gymnastics is in hiding from her parents. Dominique 
Moceanu has filed suit so she can become independent from her parents 
and get control of the money she has made. She claims -- there is 
a court order now keeping them away from her. ABC's Erin Hayes reports 
from Houston. At 17, she is a champion many times over -- a U.S. hopeful 
for the next Olympics. Dominique Moceanu is also, legally, still a 
child. But, she is claiming she lost that childhood to parents, former 
gymnasts themselves, too eager to see her win. Too anxious to spend 
the millions she has earned -- money she says her father mismanaged 
in a trust fund she says in her lawsuit, that is now broke. She doesn't 
have to say that her parents are bad people, which she hasn't done. 
She has simply said that she has been the money tree. Her father, 
dimitry, a romanian immigrant, is her manager, runs the gym built 
with her money. He will not discuss money issues. Um, no comment on 
that. But he insists his daughter is being manipulated by others -- 
eager to cash in on Dominique's increasing fame. Until they intervened, 
he says, she was fine. The pressure doesn't bother her. For the last 
five, six years, since she was ten, it doesn't seem to bother her. 
Not quite what she said this summer, after winning the goodwill games. 
I know all my hard work paid off, and just a lot of stress and a lot 
of, you know, hard times. She cries a lot. Her courtppointed mediator 
believes Dominique has been unhappy for a long time. It is my impression 
that this decision was not made quickly, that is was not made foolishly 
or lightheartedly. That is now up to a court to decide. Erin Hayes, 
ABC News, Houston.
