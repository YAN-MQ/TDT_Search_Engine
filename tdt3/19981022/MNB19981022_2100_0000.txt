A dramatic back-from-the-brink and down-to-the-wire talks ongoing 
in maryland, a peace deal in the mideast is in the balance. The C.I.A. 
is playing a major role. The private lives that are making bizarre 
public headlines, including a Debate over a major sitcom star, the 
comeback of a player in the world of sports and a gymnast suing her 
own parents and the last word on the death of an O liverian. And in 
New York, a sweep of the series. It's a stretch of road about to play 
host to another victorious New York team.
