There are two David Dorfmans. One is a choreographer who can lift 
the spirit with luscious rollicking movement that somehow communicates 
the great pleasure that might be felt by a dancer who, like Dorfman, 
is stockier, older and less well-trained than the norm. The other 
choreographer seems to hedge his bets with words and cute humor. Both 
were present Tuesday night when David Dorfman Dance opened a week 
at the Joyce Theater. The first Dorfman was evident in the fussily 
reworked ``Gone Right Back.'' But the second Dorfman stole the show 
with ``A Cure for Gravity,'' a handsome, boisterous and poignant celebration 
of the music of Joe Jackson. The world of ``A Cure for Gravity,'' 
a New York premiere, is filled with warm orange light and dense darkness 
populated by six men and women in stylish orange and cranberry-colored 
practice clothes designed by Liz Prince. The curtain rises on a line 
of three couples engaged in long, unbroken kissing. The dance's tone 
of playfulness and fraught emotion is set in this first of six sections, 
performed to racing instrumental music played on tape by Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg 
on solo violin and Jackson on bongos. The couples tumble into new 
matches then part, reform and finally scatter into a limb-thrusting 
tango for flung bodies. The assembling and reassembling is a theme 
throughout, in helter-skelter dance under a huge high-hanging open 
ladder, almost a horizontal stairway through the air, that shifts 
slowly as the piece progresses. The dancers bound and scamper with 
exhilarating unexpectedness into geometric patterns, diagonals and 
half-circles that seem to enclose a community's central, sacred dancing 
ground. Dorfman's changing presence is another motif. At one point, 
he is simply a thick, bullet-shaped body exuberantly keeping up with 
the others. At another, he is a distanced observer whose ruminations 
are communicated silently to the audience in the dancing he has given 
his five charges, his half-smile as sly as the taped vocals by Suzanne 
Vega and Jackson. Melancholy settles in, as does more complex physical 
communication, the shifts signaled in part by the gradual revealing 
of a backdrop, ink-blue and mottled. Reclining partners gently manipulate 
each other's limbs, as if exploring how they work. Blown kisses become 
lascivious, and an angry physicality takes over briefly. At the end, 
a woman climbs up clustered bodies to reach toward the unattainable 
stairway and sky; she rolls down, followed by another woman. There 
is a post-apocalyptic feel to ``A Cure for Gravity.'' Its enjoyably 
unself-conscious mix of same-sex and heterosexual couples suggests 
the dance might almost be unfolding in a world changed by the recent 
killing of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming. Full of possibilities, the 
piece was made all the richer by the first-rate performances of Jeanine 
Durning, Curt Haworth, Hetty King, Lisa Race, Tom Thayer and Dorfman. 
The set was by Christopher Plant, the backdrop by Andy Benavides and 
the lighting by Chloe Brown.
