Before we go, a reminder up next on "in profile," a look at the often 
controversial career of Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner, seen last 
night actually crying tears of joy. Next on mst NBC. With thanks to 
onmontone in the middle of Times Square, that is our broadcast for 
this evening. We hope to see you tomorrow night for the Friday edition. 
Good night, everybody. Around their necks Reading I am acting compared 
to the compelling low key realism of a man apparently never acted 
before. Kotite wasn't even good with the media after games. Yet lurching 
around in polliester vests, it looks like he studied with gilgood, 
with olivier. I'm not kidding. It was sheer brilliance. Even if the 
man won nine Super Bowls, this should have been his calling. I swear. 
This reminder for all your investigation and a A-star-is-born news, 
"the big show" at 8:00 and White House at 11:00. "The news" is next. 
For all of us here, I'm Keith olbermann. Thank you and good night. 
We have no right to dictate
