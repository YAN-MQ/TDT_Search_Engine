Paul McCartney is softening his stance on testing drugs on animals. 
McCartney, along with his late wife Linda, was always a staunch animal 
rights activist. McCartney tells the BBC that when his wife was fighting 
breast cancer, she took drugs that were tested on animals. He says 
he now realizes some of that testing is absolutely necessary, but 
that it's still hard for him to think like that.
