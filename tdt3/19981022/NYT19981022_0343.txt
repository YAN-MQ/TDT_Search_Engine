Much as I enjoy the American theater, it has never occurred to me 
that the programs we clutch as we settle into our seats could be hung 
in a place of honor in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. 
Yet that is what lately happened to more than 150 programs from one 
of the great ages of the avant-garde theater in Paris. Two Washington 
collectors, Martin Atlas and his wife, Liane, devoted themselves for 
more than 30 years to the search for them, and the National Gallery 
was delighted to accept them as a gift from the Atlas Foundation. 
More than 100 of the programs are on view at the National Academy 
Museum in Manhattan. They fill three large galleries, and the point 
is well made that they matter as much to the history of European art 
as they do to the history of the European theater. Between 1887 and 
1900, there were three small theaters in Paris that put on plays new 
and old that could not be seen anywhere else. Whether at the Theatre 
Libre (1887-94), at the Theatre d'Art (1890-92) or at the Theatre 
de l'Oeuvre (1893-1900), you could see challenging and unfamiliar 
works. The plays ranged in date from 1632 (John Ford's `` 'Tis Pity 
She's a Whore'') to 1892 (Maeterlinck's ``Pelleas et Melisande''), 
1896 (Alfred Jarry's uproarious ``Ubu Roi'' and Oscar Wilde's ``Salome'') 
and 1897 (Ibsen's ``John Gabriel Borkman''). The theaters depended 
mainly upon subscribers. They were run by gifted and highly educated 
young people who had known one another since their schooldays. Nobody 
was in it for the money, which was just as well, because there wasn't 
any. Some of the best young painters of the day were full partners 
in almost every production. They designed the scenery. They were also 
responsible for every detail of the programs. Those programs were 
simplicity itself, consisting of a single sheet of paper, sometimes 
folded and sometimes not. Printed on one side only, and usually in 
one color, they listed the author's name, the title of the play and 
(in very small type) the names of the performers. Thereafter, the 
audience was on its own with a single page on which the written word 
merged in unpredictable ways with an image that spread every which 
way across the sheet. Sometimes people grumbled. Where was the summary 
of the plot? What kind of help were they getting from those peculiar 
images? Why weren't they getting more for their money? With hindsight, 
we know that these programs were not an impertinence. Nor did they 
give short weight in terms of their lasting value. Regular patrons 
of the three theaters could form a collection that we now recognize 
as museum material of a high order. None of the images were copies 
or reproductions. Made specially for the occasion, they appeared nowhere 
else. They were the authentic ``artist's prints'' in a private world. 
The artists included Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard, Edouard Vuillard, 
Paul Signac, Maurice Denis, Felix Vallotton and Theophile Alexandre 
Steinlen. When Ibsen's plays became staples in the repertory, the 
playwright's great compatriot, Edvard Munch, designed the programs, 
often with hallucinatory effect. This was a historic alliance between 
art and the theater. In 1896, when Wilde's ``Salome'' (in its original 
French version) was on the bill, Toulouse-Lautrec was delighted to 
design the program, though Wilde at that time was disgraced and in 
exile. When the fare was lighter and easier, there were contributions 
by a raft of Parisian illustrators who were never less than deft (and 
often very amusing). No one would call Henri-Gabriel Ibels a major 
artist, but the image on his program for a play called ``The Fossils'' 
in 1892 is everyone's idea of a paradisal day by the northern sea. 
When Aurelien Lugne-Poe formed the Theatre de l'Oeuvre in 1893, he 
and his friends and colleagues were in their early 20s. Lugne-Poe 
himself was only 23 when he played the key role of Golaud in the first 
performance in Paris of Maeterlinck's ``Pelleas et Melisande''. With 
a new production due every four weeks, it was grueling work. But it 
was also enormous fun. When there was no scenery for a coming production, 
Vuillard and Bonnard pitched in and painted some. (None of that scenery 
has survived). When Ibsen's ``Peer Gynt'' called for a group of trolls, 
one was played by Jarry, who was to become famous no more than a month 
later as the author of ``Ubu Roi.'' Produced by Lugne-Poe in December 
1896, ``Ubu Roi'' is still valid as the portrait of an implacable 
despot of a kind that is far from extinct. (We can imagine why the 
great Irish poet William Butler Yeats should have said, ``After us, 
the Savage God,'' as he left the first performance.) Lugne-Poe could 
not have wished for a more accurate estimate of why ``Ubu'' mattered 
then and why it still matters now. So I hope that he overheard what 
Yeats had to say. It was with ``Ubu Roi'' that the 20th century awoke 
to nightmare. Country after country was to have its Ubu, and the last 
decade of our century has had them in spades. ``Ubu'' is very funny, 
but it also chills the blood. To have put it on the stage may well 
have been the greatest achievement of Lugne-Poe as an actor-manager. 
The production has vanished, but the program designed by Jarry himself 
has not. Its raw power is amply evident at the National Academy Museum. 
Lugne-Poe never set out to create a scandal. When he produced John 
Ford's `` 'Tis Pity She's a Whore'' in 1894, he dropped the original 
title and renamed the play ``Annabella,'' after its principal character. 
But in the case of ``Ubu'' he was true to what he had once said: ``I 
do not set out to be impudent, but if trouble arises, I shall not 
shirk it.'' That's the way theater should be.
