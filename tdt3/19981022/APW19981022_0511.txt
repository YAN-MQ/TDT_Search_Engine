Germany's highest court said Thursday it would decide soon whether 
to block the deportation of a Turkish teen-ager, born and raised in 
Germany, who is accused of more than 60 offenses. A Constitutional 
Court spokesman said Judge Berthold Sommer was reviewing the 14-year-old's 
case and would rule in the next few days. Officials in Bavaria began 
proceedings this summer to deport the boy, known simply as Mehmet, 
and his parents to Turkey. The case became an election-year symbol 
for conservatives demanding a crackdown on foreigners who commit crimes 
here. Although the parents have lived and worked in Munich for 30 
years without problems, Bavarian officials accused them of endangering 
society by failing to properly raise their son. Courts in Bavaria 
have blocked efforts so far to deport the parents, but on Tuesday 
upheld the state's refusal to renew the boy's residency permit. State 
officials had said Mehmet could be put on a plane to Turkey as early 
as next week. Guido Westerwelle, general secretary of the liberal 
Free Democrats, accused Bavarian officials Thursday of seeking to 
deport Mehmet as a ``diversionary tactic'' to cover up the failure 
of social services there to help a problem child.
