The father of Olympic gold medalist Dominique Moceanu says he wants 
his daughter to come home and start gymnastics training again. The 
17-year-old gymnast has hired a lawyer to petition a court to declare 
her an adult, so she can take over her business affairs. Moceanu's 
legal team believes her parents have squandered at least $4 million 
she has earned during her career. Her parent deny those accusations.
