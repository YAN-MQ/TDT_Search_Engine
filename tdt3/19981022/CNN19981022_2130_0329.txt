The results of the autopsy on Florence Griffith-Joyner were released 
today. The orange county, California, coroner's office lists suffocation 
as the cause of death. The report says Griffith-Joyner had an epileptic 
seizure in her sleep, and her position in bed caused her to suffocate. 
When the three-time Olympic gold medalist died last month, some people 
raised questions of steroid use. The coroner's report shows only two 
common, over-the-counter drugs were in her system.
