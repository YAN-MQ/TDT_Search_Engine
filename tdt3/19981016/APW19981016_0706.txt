Trial opened Friday against a former Bavarian state legislator charged 
with running up 27,000 marks (dlrs 16,770) worth of calls to a telephone 
sex hotline at taxpayers' expense. State prosecutor Stefan Antor needed 
nearly an hour without pause to read before the court a list of 450 
sex calls allegedly made by Hans Wallner, 48, from his office in the 
state legislature. Wallner's defense lawyer Sascha Prosotowitz said 
he wants state police experts to investigate whether or not his client 
was a victim of computer hackers. He said an extension to Wallner's 
office phone appears to have been manipulated with the use of a modem 
or other equipment. And he noted that on some days, the sequence of 
calls would not have left time to eat or sleep. One day, for example, 
calls were placed to a sex hotline for 23 out of 32 hours. The defense 
also pointed out that many of the calls ended ended exactly after 
1180 units or 59 minutes. But prosecutors noted that the calls suddenly 
stopped the same day the defendant was notified of the bills. The 
trial continues next week.
