You're tuned in the voice of America broadcasting from Washington. 
I'm Frank Whitis bringing you this hour of VOA News Now. It's 10 hours, 
19 Universal Time, and here's the top story we're following this hour. 
The prestigious 1998 Noble Peace Prize has been awarded to David Trimble 
and John Hume of Northern Ireland for their part in working to settle 
the long running Sectarian Dispute. We'll have more on that story 
a little later. Time now for a look at sports with VOA's Jim Stevenson.
