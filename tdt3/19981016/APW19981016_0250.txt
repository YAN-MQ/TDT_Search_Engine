Shocked by the mysterious murders of at least 153 people accused of 
sorcery, Indonesia's justice minister wants to outlaw black magic 
_ a practice in the Southeast Asian nation since ancient times. During 
recent months, parts of the main island of Java have been terrorized 
by masked killers dressed in black, according to police, witnesses 
and media reports. They say the killers strike at night, cutting their 
victims throats and sometimes hanging mutilated bodies in trees or 
tossing them in the street. Mobs have also attacked and killed people 
they accuse of dabbling in black magic. Some of the dead were Muslim 
clerics. Others were farmers or ordinary villagers. In the latest 
attack in Jember, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of Jakarta, 
an angry crowd repeatedly stabbed a man to death after accusing him 
of being a sorcerer. They later threw his body into the sea, the newspaper 
Suara Pembaruan reported. Police have arrested more than 100 suspects 
in the kilings, but acknowledge there's no clear motive for the grisly 
slayings. The Jakarta Post newspaper Friday quoted Justice Minister 
Muladi as saying fear of sorcery has stirred up unrest and violence 
in superstitious communities. ``The impact of this issue is very disturbing 
and it often claims innocent victims,'' he said. He said anyone who 
openly claims they can kill or hurt others with black magic should 
be punished. ``That would be one way to resolve the witchcraft issue,'' 
Muladi said. In Indonesia's second largest city, Surabaya, officers 
Wednesday night fired warning shots above protesters when they stormed 
a police station in the mistaken belief that three out-of-town detectives 
inside were murder suspects. Three protesters were hospitalized with 
gunshot wounds. ``People become suspicious of just about anything 
nowadays,'' said North Surabaya police chief Lt. Col. Sunaryono. The 
surge in violence has erupted as Indonesia grapples with political 
turmoil and the worst economic crisis in decades. Violent protests 
killed about 1,200 people and helped drive former authoritarian President 
Suharto from office in May. At that time members of the mostly Christian 
or Buddhist ethnic Chinese minority were targeted because of their 
relative wealth. However, this new violence is now plaguing the Islamic 
majority. Amid the social confusion of the economic crisis _ skyrocketing 
inflation, unemployment, poverty and food shortages _ no one is sure 
who is doing the killing or why. Police speculate the slayings might 
be in revenge for the slaughter of tens of thousands of communists 
in the mid-1960s when Suharto took power after an abortive coup attempt. 
Historians say Muslim clerics helped the army carry out the carnage. 
Others believe the killings may represent a bloody power play before 
general elections next year. A third possibility is that some Muslim 
groups want to stamp out mysticism that still permeates Indonesian 
society. About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim, 
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
