He survived an assassination attempt and made the popemobile a household 
word. Today Pope John Paul II celebrated his 20th anniversary as Pope 
with a special mass in St. Peter's square. 20,000 poles from his native 
Homeland attended. Gayle young reports in two decades the former archbishop 
of krakow has become a world leader. The Roman Catholic faithful are 
singing the praises of Pope John Paul II -- as in this music video 
by a well-known Italian pop singer -- in honor of the Pontiff's anniversary. 
It was 20 years ago today that the college of Cardinals shocked the 
world by announcing the election of a respected but generally unknown 
Polish prelate to lead the church's 1 billion Catholics. In his two 
decades as Pope, John Paul II has become a leading international figure, 
making a record-breaking 85 trips outside of Italy. But anniversary 
celebrations will be minimal. Besides the musical tributes, there 
is only a special mass planned for Sunday in St. Peter's square. The 
low-key schedule may be due in part to John Paul's well-known dislike 
of public praise directed to him personally. The lack of events may 
also reflect the Pope's deteriorating health. He is making increasingly 
fewer public appearances as he prepares for the rigors of the Jubilee, 
the 2,000th anniversary of Christ's birth. But though he may be physically 
weaker, he remains an extremely strong leader. He's never wavered 
in his ops situation to breests, birth control and abortion. He believes 
that without a strong papacy, the church is apt to fall apart. That 
national Churches will go their own way. He may Shun personal tributes, 
but in two decades John Paul II has become the most visible and powerful 
figure the Catholic church has produced this century. Gayle young, 
CNN, Rome.
