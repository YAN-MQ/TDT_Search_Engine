Israeli and Palestinian leaders, under the prodding hand of U.S. officials, 
are making some progress toward an interim accord, officials said 
Friday, but they described the going as slow and the mistrust as still 
deep. ``All of these issues have been politicized for so long,'' one 
official said, ``there has to be a lot of clearing of the air.'' The 
delegations are spending too much time arguing over who should be 
in which meetings and why, without always concentrating on the substance 
at hand, the official said, in remarks confirmed by other officials 
with knowledge of the talks here. Israeli officials said they would 
not come to any agreement ``just to have one,'' while a Palestinian 
official complained about the slow pace of the discussions. Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian 
leader, together with large delegations of experts and advisers, are 
gathered in seclusion at the Wye Conference Center near here. Under 
the push of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the special 
envoy Dennis Ross _ with President Clinton expected to come to help 
on Saturday _ the two sides are trying to finish a long overdue agreement 
under which Israel will withdraw from another 13 percent of the West 
Bank in return for specific Palestinian steps against terrorism. The 
greatest progress was made on the question of security. George Tenet, 
the director of central intelligence, joined the talks Friday to help 
the two sides work out the U.S. role in judging the Palestinian security 
service's effort at combating the radicals in their midst, like the 
Hamas movement. An official said the CIA was critical to begin to 
dispel the deep Israeli mistrust of the Palestinian security forces, 
``to figure out a way to validate any Palestinian claims of best efforts 
at fighting terrorism.'' While both sides have accepted this U.S. 
role as the best way to assess Arafat's commitment to battling those 
who oppose a peace, it is proving complicated ``to operationalize'' 
the concept in a lasting way, the official said. While the two sides 
spent the most time discussing security, the talks advanced on the 
economic front as well. They concentrated on the issue of safe passage 
for Palestinians from the West Bank to Gaza; the opening of an already 
built airport in Gaza; and how to better the lives of Palestinians 
whose access to jobs in Israel has been limited. One official with 
knowledge of the talks was gloomier, suggesting that it would be difficult 
to come to a final agreement by the end of Sunday, or Monday morning. 
He described Netanyahu and Arafat as too fond of haggling over details 
and principles and not raising their sights high enough. ``This isn't 
a peace negotiation,'' the official said. ``This is a real-estate 
transaction.'' The Israelis want Arafat to go to war against Hamas 
and to stop both public and private ``incitement'' against Israel 
and Israelis, while changing the Palestinian charter to delete clauses 
calling for Israel's destruction. Israeli officials acknowledge that 
these are difficult steps for Arafat, but they say he cannot use ``the 
excuse of weakness forever,'' one official said. On Thursday, Arafat 
told Netanyahu and Clinton that he hoped ``this will be the Camp David 
for the Palestinians and the Israelis,'' whom he called ``cousins,'' 
an official said _ the event that finally breaks the back of the main 
problems between them. Netanyahu was less lofty but clear, saying 
he had come ``to reach an agreement that is clear, specific and binding,'' 
and promised his best efforts. The atmospherics of the second day 
of talks here were good, said the State Department spokesman, James 
Rubin. ``It does appear that there is a better and more constructive 
and more pragmatic atmosphere to work on these problems than there 
had been in the past,'' he said at Friday's only public briefing for 
the press. In what appeared to be a good omen, given the two leaders' 
general dislike of one another, Netanyahu telephoned Arafat Friday 
morning and invited him over for a conversation. The two men talked, 
with a U.S. interpreter, for nearly 90 minutes before a joint lunch 
given by Ms. Albright. In the evening, a U.S. invitation to be hosts 
at a joint Sabbath dinner was politely declined by Netanyahu, who 
did not want a religious meal to be inevitably politicized, an Israeli 
official said. The Wye Center has a synagogue for worship. So the 
Israelis ate alone and the Americans ate with the Palestinians. Two 
key Israeli officials, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister 
Yitzhak Mordechai, will not arrive until later. Sharon, after visiting 
Friday with King Hussein of Jordan, who is ill, at the Mayo Clinic 
in Minnesota, is to arrive here on Saturday night, while Mordechai, 
who remained in Israel to deal with an unexplained security issue, 
will not arrive until Sunday morning.
