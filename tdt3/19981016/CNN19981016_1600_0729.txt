of private business networks. Introducing Hughes. A familiar name 
with a brand new focus. When you need the best in satellite and wireless 
communications. We make it happen. If you could accompany your data 
on its trip overseas the experience would be alarming. Local carriers 
handing it to national carriers over to cable carriers... till you 
don't know who has your data. Unless you send it through here. With

and international. So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI 
Worldcom.
