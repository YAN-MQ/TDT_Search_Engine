This is "Headline News." I'm Catherine Callaway. Western and Yugoslav 
officials sign the second of two pacts today. Today's agreement allows 
two thousand unarmed monitors to travel Kosovo checking whether Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic complies with promises to end the crackdown 
on Kosovo. Milosevic was given until tomorrow to comply with the NATO 
agreement. But NAto allies could decide to extend the deadline. They're 
meeting in Brussels today to make that determination.
