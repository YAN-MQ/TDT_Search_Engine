Game one of the world series between the San Diego padres and New 
York Yankees will begin Saturday night in the Bronx. Coven brown will 
get the start for San Diego, New York will have David Wells. Growing 
up in San Diego, being a padre fan, being a Yankee fan, and, you know, 
and just always hoping that would happen, but it never did over the 
years until now. And you know, it just makes it that more exciting. 
Duane Walker, "Headline Sports."
