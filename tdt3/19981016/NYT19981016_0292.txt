Culture wars may come and go, but some things don't change: Culture 
wars are almost never about culture, and are almost always more dramatic, 
more entertaining and more farcical than the supposedly incendiary 
art works that ignite them. As Ben Brantley wrote in his dead-on Times 
review of Terrence McNally's long-debated ``gay Jesus'' play, ``Corpus 
Christi,'' when it actually opened this week, ``The excitement stops 
right after the metal detectors.'' It was all too predictable that 
the show that sparked dozens of tabloid headlines, raucous protests 
and pious counterprotests sight unseen would prove not only to be 
stupefyingly dull but also less sacrilegious than ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' 
once viewed in the flesh. (And not much flesh at that.) The whole 
incident is nothing if not a replay of three decades ago when police 
were summoned to handle armies of warring protesters at the Broadway 
opening of ``The Deputy,'' a play that questioned Pope Pius XII's 
moral courage during the Holocaust. The only bomb was on stage, but 
the publicity turned the show, now forgotten, into a quasi-hit and 
earned its producer a Tony for his courage. As a political football, 
``Corpus Christi'' has sold out its run and given the theater its 
biggest media windfall in years. Local TV news led with the story. 
The conservative New York Post went so far as to supplement its secular 
pan with a second, clerical review to denounce the blasphemy; the 
liberal online magazine Slate, heretofore not known for its drama 
criticism, was so eager to weigh in on ``Corpus Christi'' that it 
ran its pan days before the official opening. Yet even McNally's play 
is not the culture-war pinata to receive the most disproportionate 
attention in relation to its tiny cultural weight this fall. That 
honor falls to ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' an utterly 
vacuous TV sitcom that has been as loudly protested by the African-American 
left as ``Corpus Christi'' has been by the religious right. The sex-addled 
``Desmond Pfeiffer'' is set in the Lincoln White House but is about 
the Clinton White House. Its title character, a fictional black English 
butler, is the only one on screen who sounds like a rational adult 
rather than a burlesque refugee from the Starr report. Despite its 
nominal historical period, this show has no more to do with race or 
the Civil War than does ``Married With Children.'' But that didn't 
stop the Beverly Hills-Hollywood branch of the NAACP from marching 
on Paramount, the show's producer, to protest its supposed trivialization 
of slavery. Jesse Jackson joined in, demanding the series be taken 
``off the air.'' The L.A. City Council, fearing the show could ``fan 
the flames of racial discord,'' unanimously passed a resolution directing 
the city's Human Rights Commission to investigate it. One black activist, 
Danny Bakewell _ sounding just like the Catholic League in its protests 
of ``Corpus Christi'' _ has argued that no one would treat the Holocaust 
as irreverently as ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' has allegedly mocked slavery. 
Apparently he's unaware of ``Hogan's Heroes'' or Mel Brooks, who has 
made light of the Holocaust, the Spanish Inquisition AND slavery in 
``The Producers'' and ``History of the World, Part I.'' As if to mimic 
the right's knee-jerk demagoguery about ``Corpus Christi,'' commentators 
on the left have eagerly condemned ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' without actually 
seeing it. And as the protests turned McNally's play into a temporary 
hit, the ink spilled over ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' has kept it alive despite 
dismal reviews and ratings. Who behaves worse in these symbolic controversies, 
the left or the right? This month the edge goes to the right. In all 
the debate over freedom of speech sparked by both ``Corpus Christi'' 
and ``Desmond Pfeiffer,'' only one person has actually been silenced. 
At the conservative P.C. paper The Washington Times _ which ran Pat 
Buchanan's pre-opening assault on ``Corpus Christi'' and has even 
managed to smoke out anti-American and anti-Christian sentiment in 
``Saving Private Ryan'' _ the editor refused to let his longtime drama 
critic, Nelson Pressley, review the McNally play at all. Pressley 
didn't like the play any more than most critics, but he quit his job 
rather than submit to censorship. If there is any casualty in these 
culture wars besides common sense, artistic standards and countless 
trees, he alone is it.
