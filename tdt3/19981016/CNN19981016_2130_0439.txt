were recognized for their work today. John Hume and David trimble 
were named this year's recipients of the nobel peace prize. The men 
head northern Ireland's two main political parties. Their efforts 
resulted in a peace agreement this past April. The nobel committee 
cited them for great political courage and consistency in their work 
towards peacefully resolving years of violence and hatred in northern 
Ireland. The two men will share $963,000. The award will be presented
