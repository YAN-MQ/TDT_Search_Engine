Movie director Steven Spielberg is giving back to the community. His 
starbright foundation is raising money with a CD of celebrities retelling 
the classic story "the emperor's new clothes." I am the emperor's 
personal merrymaker. I'm neither tall nor short, neither round nor 
thin. I'm just your typical fool. I am the butt of my own jokes. In 
fact, my butt is a joke. Robin Williams was among the stars who gave 
a trial reading in Los Angeles Thursday. The starbright foundation 
is a nonprofit organization that helps seriously ill children.
