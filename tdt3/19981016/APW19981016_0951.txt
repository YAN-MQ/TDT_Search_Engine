Mexico and the United States are failing to adequately combat drug 
trafficking over their borders because their priorities are wrong, 
according to a report by the non-governmental organization Geopolitical 
Drugs Watch. The Paris-based group's annual report, published Thursday, 
said both countries laid more emphasis on ``subversive groups'' in 
Mexico, and cross-border economic ties than on the drug war, allowing 
drug barons to flourish. ``Despite the often spectacular seizures 
and arrests, the bilateral structures to fight drugs put into effect 
by the U.S. and Mexican governments ... have been incapable of reducing 
the intensity of drug trafficking,'' the 200-page report said. It 
added that, on a wider scale, the worldwide fight against drugs is 
doomed if governments continue to believe the key is increasing the 
number of police and troops fighting the barons, a policy the report 
described as ``repressive, and therefore reactive.'' The report claimed 
drug trafficking-related interests had gained ``considerable clout 
in Mexico's politics and economy since the start of the 1980s.'' It 
said Mexican drug barons laundered money in the country's tourist 
resorts, and that tourists contributed to their wealth and legitimacy. 
``The millions of Americans that each year take vacations in Mexico's 
tourist paradise spots unwittingly contribute to the profits of the 
drug barons who have spent billions of dollars there over the last 
15 years,'' the report said. The report implicated Carlos Hank Gonzalez, 
one of the most powerful members of Mexico's ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, saying his ``shady businesses'' enjoyed widespread 
protection. Hank Gonzalez ``is untouchable and will probably remain 
so, in the United States and Mexico,'' the report said, adding that 
he was suspected of money laundering and drug trafficking. Hank Gonzalez 
has served in many of Mexico's highest political posts. Though he 
currently holds no political office, he is considered a behind-the-scenes 
force in his party. The Geopolitical Drugs Watch is a private French 
organization whose sole income comes from research projects.
