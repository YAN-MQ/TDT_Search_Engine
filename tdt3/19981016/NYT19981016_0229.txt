When the Vatican released Pope John Paul II's latest encyclical on 
Thursday, it published a document by a trained philosopher who explores 
and amplifies a historic church position that faith and reason cannot 
be separated. He does so in a style that some Roman Catholic scholars 
say might even make it a useful text for undergraduate courses. But 
scholars said the encyclical, ``Fides et Ratio'' (``Faith and Reason''), 
which was addressed to the bishops, should not be read simply as a 
document of interest primarily to them and students, but one that 
comes with a message for a worldwide, growing church. The encyclical 
contains a critique of past intellectual trends and a look ahead. 
John Paul II examines and rejects various philosophical trends that 
he said have abandoned the search for truth. And noting that Christianity 
is about to enter its third millennium, the pope declares the church 
as reason's defender against intellectuals who have given up on discovering 
absolute truth. The pope, said the Rev. Avery Dulles, professor of 
religion and society at Fordham University, is ``saying that the church 
has a duty to defend human reason and, paradoxically, people outside 
the church don't seem to be doing it.'' Philosophy is the pope's academic 
specialty. As a priest in Poland, the Rev. Karol Wojtyla received 
his doctorate in the subject from Jagiellonian University in Poland 
in 1960. But his encyclical proclaims anew ideas with a long history 
in Catholic thinking. ``It's a timely re-statement of a particular 
position that goes back to the 13th century and was re-emphasized 
in the 19th century, but particularly needs to be said today,'' Dulles 
said. ``I think it comes from his heart.'' The 150-page document contains 
some specialized language in its discussion of trends in philosophy. 
But some sections are written in a style accessible to a broader audience. 
In its earliest chapters, for example, the pope says that some questions 
are universal, such as ``Who am I?'' and ``Does life have a meaning?'' 
In so doing, he strikes at a resonant chord with contemporary culture, 
where much public discussion has focused on the need to re-establish 
a sense of community and to discover shared social values. ``It's 
very upbeat in its overall tone,'' said the Rev. Robert Sokolowski, 
who teaches philosophy at Catholic University of America, in Washington, 
in an assessment echoed by others who have read the encyclical. ``It's 
kind of an exhortation to be confident in the discoveries of reason.'' 
He added, ``It's also very important that he sees religion and faith 
as not destroying reason. You don't have to abandon your intellect 
when you believe.'' Some scholars who read the encyclical said that 
they could imagine it having a classroom use. ``I teach a course in 
philosophy of religion,'' said the Rev. Brian Shanley, who teaches 
philosophy at Catholic University. ``This is the kind of document 
that I might want the students to look at to reiterate the classical 
line.'' Shanley also saw a wider application for the encyclical, which 
contains sections stating that the faith's essentials remain constant 
regardless of the surrounding culture, no matter what part of the 
world the church is in. ``The word of God is not addressed to any 
one people or to any one period of history,'' the pope writes. ``Similarly, 
dogmatic statements, while reflecting at times the culture of the 
period in which they were defined, formulate an unchanging and ultimate 
truth.'' The encyclical mounts a defense of the church's ability to 
proclaim its faith against ``post-modern'' philosophical tendencies. 
``When philosophy is saying all truth claims are relative,'' Shanley 
said, then the challenge the church faces is that it becomes more 
difficult to teach that all believers should be bound by the decisions 
of church councils that took place in past centuries in Europe. One 
of most important trends of John Paul II's 20-year reign has been 
a geographic shift of the world's Catholic population toward the Southern 
Hemisphere. Between 1976 and 1995, Catholics in Africa and Asia together 
grew from 14 percent of the church's members to 20 percent, according 
to church statistics. By contrast, the Catholic population of Europe 
has been largely stable. .''
