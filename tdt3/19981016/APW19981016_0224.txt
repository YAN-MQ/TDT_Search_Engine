Philippine shares ended sharply higher Friday, buoyed by a surprise 
cut in key U.S. interest rates late Thursday that led to huge overnight 
gains on Wall Street. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index 
closed up 94.58 points, or 7 percent, at 1437.36, following a gain 
of 18.56-points, or 1.4 percent, Thursday. Except for the loss suffered 
by the main index Wednesday, the market has been on the rise since 
Oct. 6, with the main market indicator gaining a total of 314.37 points 
so far. Traders said Manila shares took their cue from the decision 
by the U.S. Federal Reserve late Thursday to lower the target for 
the Fed Funds rate by a quarter-percentage point to 5.0 percent, while 
also cutting the discount rate by the same margin to 4.75 percent. 
The rate cuts came as a surprise since the U.S. Federal Reserve normally 
does not adjust interest rates in between its regular board meetings, 
traders said. The latest rate cuts also closely followed reductions 
in key U.S. rates instituted by the U.S. Federal Reserve last month. 
Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc., said the prospect 
of the latest U.S. rate cuts encouraging investment portfolio managers 
to look to emerging markets like those in Asia sent Manila shares 
on an upswing. ``Our market coming from a low base also helped us 
a lot during Friday's rally,'' he said. At the Philippine Dealing 
System, the Philippine peso finished stronger Friday, lifted by the 
yen's advance against the dollar following the Federal Reserve's move 
to cut interest rates. The dollar averaged 42.987 pesos, down from 
Thursday's average of 43.23 pesos. The dollar was last dealt at 42.92 
pesos. Volume swelled to dlrs 138.5 million from the previous session's 
dlrs 97 million. If the yen gains more ground, traders said the peso 
will likely advance against the dollar as well. The central bank wasn't 
active in the spot market. Kane, however, was quick to point out that 
the run-up being experienced by Asian stock markets shouldn't be taken 
as a sign that all is well again. He said regional economies remain 
weak and there is a growing threat this may eventually lead to a global 
meltdown.
