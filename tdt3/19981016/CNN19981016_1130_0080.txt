Two men are being honored today for their commitment to peace. David 
trimble and John Hume are the newest recipients of the nobel peace 
prize for their work on the northern Ireland peace accord. Hume heads 
the mainly Catholic social democratic and labour party, while trimble 
leads the Protestant Ulster unionist party. John Irvine takes a look 
at these two influential men. The nobel committee was expected to 
reward some of northern Ireland's peace makers. The two main political 
leaders here were the most deserving. John Hume, David trimble. It 
hoped it would inspire others around the world. This is a very important 
point to the committee that this should serve as an example also for 
other countries. John Hume was in his home city when the news came 
through. The nobel committee described Mr. Hume has the clearest and 
most consistent of northern Ireland's leaders in his work for a political 
solution. Well, as you would expect, I'm very deeply honored to have 
received this award today. But I see it not as an award to myself, 
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process 
in northern Ireland. The other, David trimble is in the United States. 
The committee said he had shown great political courage when at the 
critical stage in the process he advocated solutions which lead to 
the peace agreement. Earlier this year as the negotiations entered 
their final stage, the relationship between Mr. Hume and trimble was 
pivotal. They became an effective double act. Now their act together 
has earned them one of the Moss prestige ious accumulateds. I think 
it has gone to those who deserve it most. It is their courage, their 
determination that takes the peace process forward. They have to do 
it and I'm plaelsed that it is to John and David. This is a poost 
for the northern Ireland peace process and for David trimble in particular 
for he's under pressure from members of his own party. They would 
be foolish to try to undermine a winner of the nobel peace prize.
