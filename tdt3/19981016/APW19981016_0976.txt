American Venus Williams blasted her way into the semifinals of the 
European Championships on Friday, polishing off a straight-sets win 
over Mary Pierce with a world record serve. At match point, Williams 
hammered a 205 km/hour (127.4 miles/hour) serve past a stunned Pierce, 
to close out the one-sided contest 6-4, 6-1. In earlier quarterfinal 
play, new world No. 1 American Lindsay Davenport lived up to her new 
status, annihilating sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer for her place in the 
semifinals. The 22-year-old defending champion breezed past the world 
No.13, dispatching Coetzer 6-3, 6-1 in just 58 minutes for her seventh 
straight victory over the South African. But for a short while the 
world's top player was overshadowed by the world's fastest server, 
with Williams turning some of the media attention Davenport is so 
uncomfortable with onto herself. ``That's something, that's crazy,'' 
said Williams, whose previous record was a spectacular 201 km/hr (125 
miles/hr) in Wimbledon. ``I teed up for an ace that serve. I hit that 
ball perfectly. It was great timing and technique. `It'll be awhile 
before I can get it faster, maybe the Australian Open.'' The 18-year-old 
American was hitting big off the start, serving up three love games 
in the first set. Pierce kept up with Williams until 4-4, when the 
American broke her serve, then held to clinch the set. From the start 
of the second, Pierce was completely overwhelmed by an aggressive, 
powerful Williams, who jumped to a 3-0 lead. While Pierce clung to 
her serve to go 3-1, the American won the next three games, firing 
three consecutive aces, closing out the match with the record-breaker. 
The American served a total of 13 aces. ``I don't feel I missed any 
chances,'' said Pierce, seeded seventh. ``I maybe had a small chance 
in the first set but in the second there was nothing I could do against 
her. ``I didn't look at the display board after she served that last 
ace. It didn't seem any faster than the others.'' In her semifinal 
Saturday, Williams will meet fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat of France. 
Tauziat, the losing finalist last year, booked her place in the round 
of four with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 win over Austria's Barbara Schett. The 
other semifinal will see Davenport take on world No.15 Irina Spirlea 
of Romania, who disposed of eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost 6-4, 6-0 
the quarterfinals, and third-seed Conchita Martinez in the second 
round. Playing with the confidence of a world No.1, Davenport dominated 
her match against the tiny South African, who was able to hold her 
serve just once the entire match. Davenport took the South African's 
first two serves to jump to a 3-0 lead, but lost concentration, permitting 
Coetzer to break back twice and even the set. But Davenport regrouped 
to win the next seven games to take the set and a 4-1 lead in the 
second. Coetzer broke to go 4-1, but the American immediately broke 
back, winning the next two games to wrap up the match. ``I lost my 
concentration and missed a few easy balls,'' said Davenport, the U.S. 
Open champion. ``But once I won that next game and went up another 
break that was the turning point. ``I probably shouldn't have let 
it get to that point, but for the rest I played pretty well.''
