The U.S. state department is characterizing the talks at the mideast 
peace summit as constructive and pragmatic. Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders are meeting at a Maryland resort trying to break a 19 month 
stalemate in the Middle East peace process. Wolf Blitzer reports. 
President Clinton is pressing Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
and Palestinian authority President Yasser Arafat to take another 
move toward peace by early next week. This week's talk at wye river 
offer the chance for the parties to break the logjam and finally take 
the next essential steps for peace in the Middle East. The talks are 
taking place at the secluded wye river conference center on the eastern 
shore of Maryland. On the table -- an Israeli troop withdrawal from 
another 13% of the West Bank and Palestinian assurances to step up 
the fight against terrorism. As in any difficult problem, neither 
side can expect to win a hundred percent of every point. But concessions 
that seem hard now will seem far less important in the light of an 
accord that moves Israelis and Palestinians closer to lasting peace. 
Both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders say the ball is in the other's 
court. If there is a willingness and a determination on the Palestinian 
side to do this, then I think the chances will be good, and I hope 
that is the case. Peace is the most important platform for security. 
And he has to remember this. If there's an agreement, then the really 
hard work begins -- meeting next may's Oslo accord deadline to resolve 
such explosive issues as final borders, a Palestinian state, refugees, 
and Jerusalem. The United States has to get these parties to the point 
where they are starting to face seriously the issues of permanent 
status, because there isn't much time left before May 4th 1999. For 
President Clinton, a peace agreement would have a very important benefit. 
It would show he still has international clout even as he faces impeachment 
hearings. Wolf Blitzer, CNN, the White House.
