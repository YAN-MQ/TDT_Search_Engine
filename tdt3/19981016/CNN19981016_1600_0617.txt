San Francisco officials are asking supermarkets to donate their old 
shopping carts to the city's homeless. Don Knapp reports. Shopping 
carts are the urban utility vehicles of the homeless -- good for transporting 
their stuff or earning cash recycling bottles and cans. I turn them 
in to get usually about between anywhere from $6 to $13 a day. For 
some, the cart is a tenuous last link to the material world. You know, 
it's like our house -- you know what I mean? -- While we're temporarily 
homeless or permanently homeless, whatever. It may be his house, but 
it's not his cart. Practically all the shopping carts homeless folks 
use are stolen property. They cost supermarkets and, ultimately, their 
customers, millions of dollars. And they're costly to cities, too. 
What kind of a statement does it make of our city to see shopping 
carts all over the place that are unattended? City workers are the 
ones who pull the carts from the gutters and haul them to the city 
yard. And then after 90 days, if it's garbage or anything, we go ahead 
and throw the garbage away. Now in San Francisco, there's another 
proposal -- have the city give the homeless the gift of ownership, 
ownership of a personal shopping cart. That's great, because then 
they won't have to worry about them stealing it. Because I think probably 
at least one-fourth of the carts in this store would be gone now. 
I mean, look here, I got 11 of them right here. Other proposals for 
the shopping cart problem range from tough new crackdowns on shopping 
cart theft to providing free shuttle buses for the homeless. But so 
far, the one that's catching on is helping the homeless get a cart 
they can call their very own. Don Knapp, CNN, San Francisco.
