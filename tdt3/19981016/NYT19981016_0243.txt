OK, the Federal Reserve may have been stingy when it cut its short-term 
interest rate target by only a quarter of a percentage point at its 
last policy meeting Sept. 29. But on Thursday, just 16 days later, 
it more than made up for that, slicing off another quarter point. 
As if to add emphasis to the central bank's message that it is alert 
to the world's financial problems _ especially that of its banks _ 
this cut came in between the regularly scheduled meetings of the policy-setting 
Federal Open Market Committee. Investors were ecstatic. After the 
afternoon announcement from the Fed, it took the Dow Jones industrial 
average less than 45 minutes to surge nearly 300 points. The rally 
continued Friday. And more upbeat news is on its way. The odds are 
good for more reductions by the Fed in its short-term interest rate 
target, the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks. After 
the last two moves, the Fed funds rate is now 5 percent. But by March, 
investors are expecting that rate to drop to an average of 4.23 percent, 
based on the current price for the March Fed funds futures contract. 
All this is positive. But the signs of world financial distress still 
abound. Japan is working on banking reform, but its economy is still 
a mess. Congress has approved more money for the International Monetary 
Fund, but the United States and its allies still need to agree on 
new rescue strategies for the IMF. And there are many Wall Street 
firms and banks that still have big bets on bonds and other investments 
that have _ or can _ go sour. These problems are reflected in the 
spreads _ the difference between the yields on U.S. Treasury securities 
and other bonds, like corporate, mortgage, junk or emerging market. 
These spreads have surged since the Russian debt crisis. And although 
they have come down some, they are still quite high. As of Thursday, 
the yield on emerging markets bonds was 12.22 percentage points above 
comparable Treasury maturities, according to a J.P. Morgan index of 
emerging market bonds. That was down from a high of 17.05 percentage 
points on Sept. 10 but still twice the 6 percentage point spread in 
July. The spread for American junk bonds, according to a Merrill Lynch 
monthly index, was at 5.73 percentage points at the end of last month, 
more than 2 percentage points higher than in June. The spread for 
investment grade corporate debt was at 1.70 percentage points, higher 
than it was during the 1990-91 recession. The danger is clear. At 
these levels, interest rates are strangling the flow of credit to 
corporations and countries, which cannot afford to borrow. And if 
banks reduce their risk-taking and curtail their lending, the economy 
will slow sharply, and could even fall into a recession. The spreads 
reflect two different worries, said Michael Rosenberg, head of international 
fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch. ``There is the worry of increased 
default and a recession coming,'' he said. ``Also, there is the worry 
that a significant part of the investment community may still be leveraged 
and has to sell.'' Maureen Allyn, the chief economist at Scudder Kemper 
Investments, added: ``The new risk is that markets are in control 
of who gets credit and who doesn't.'' And that may mean so much control 
has been turned over to the markets that authorities _ like the Fed 
_ ``do not have the levers to do what they need to do.'' That is why 
these spreads are an important monitor for investors. Until they shrink 
back to more normal levels, the chances of an economic slowdown will 
be much greater. And until they shrink, there will still be a good 
chance that hedge funds, like Long-Term Capital Management, and some 
Wall Street firms, as well, will face the kind of losses that, when 
reported, could trigger a selloff. ``There is no all-clear signal 
until spreads come in,'' Ms. Allyn said.
