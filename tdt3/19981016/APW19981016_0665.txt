Cycling's world governing body said Friday it won't pursue disciplinary 
action against French rider Laurent Jalabert after he apologized for 
comparing top officials to neo-Nazis. During last month's Vuelta a 
Espana, Jalabert described the International Cycling Union (UCI) as 
a ``dictatorship'' and its commissioners as ``half Dracula and half 
neo-Nazi.'' UCI president Hein Verbruggen said Jalabert must apologize 
or be excluded from the World Championships earlier this month. Jalabert, 
the world's top-ranked cyclist, later pulled out of the worlds, citing 
physical and psychological fatigue. He said his withdrawal was unrelated 
to the UCI threat. The UCI said in a statement that its commissioners 
have dropped demands for action against Jalabert after receiving a 
letter from the rider dated Sept. 29 in which he ``formally regrets'' 
the incident. The solution ``demonstrates the will of the parties 
concerned to calm certain tensions that exist,'' it said. Although 
accepting Jalabert's apology, the UCI added that it ``invites all 
riders to consider in future the content and form of what they say 
to the press to avoid such situations recurring.''
