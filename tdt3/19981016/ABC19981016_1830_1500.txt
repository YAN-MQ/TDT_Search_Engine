The Pope and the Americans, not quite the challenge of the Middle 
East by any means. The Pope has never had an easy time with the 62 
million American Catholics. Our religion editor, Peggy Wehmeyer reports 
tonight on the flock that tends to wonder. Corpus Christi is not your 
typical Catholic church. In fact, under its popular priest, father 
Jim Callan, it's been breaking the rules for 22 years. Callan has 
openly defied the Vatican by blessing homosexual couples, inviting 
Protestants to take communion and by giving women roles reserved only 
for priests. The rules have to serve the people, and right now they're 
getting in the way of serving the people. So they have to be changed. 
Father Callan's rule-bending is extreme, and led to his removal last 
month from his Parish. Most dissent among American Catholics is more 
passive, a matter of church members quietly picking and choosing which 
teachings they'll follow. But Pope John Paul II is expressing deep 
concern about the full range of dissent in this country. And in the 
twilight of his papacy, he wants to make sure that American Catholics 
understand that departure from church doctrine will not be tolerated, 
that his teachings will be binding when he's no longer here to enforce 
them. To do that, he's replaced liberal Cardinals and bishops with 
conservatives. And several months ago, he issued two strong documents 
clearly aimed at curbing dissent. One forbids bishops conferences 
from issuing statements that differ from the Vatican. The other is 
a sharp rebuke to liberal theologians, warning that dissent will result 
in what he calls "just punishment." The irony in the whole thing is 
it will ruin the credibility of the teaching office the the Pope. 
But conservative Catholics say the Pope's crackdown on dissent is 
essential if the church is going to be strong and unified. He really 
wants people to be 100% faithful in their adherence to Catholic teaching, 
because he thinks this is the surest path to following Christ, and 
following Christ is the surest path to happiness and then eternal 
salivation. Leading his people toward the kingdom of God is something 
this Pope has long done by the power of persuasion. But as time runs 
out, many believe Pope John Paul is abandoning persuasion and laying 
down the law. Peggy Wehmeyer, ABC News, Dallas.
