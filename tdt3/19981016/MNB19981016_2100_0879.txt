In casper, Wyoming on this snowy Friday in October, services were 
held for 21-year-old Matthew shepard. He died Monday, five days after 
he was brutally beaten, lashed a split-rail fence apparently because 
he was gay. This morning Matthew shepard's father spoke before the 
service. He was asking for privacy from the media, thanking all those 
who had given support throughout the family's ordeal. On behalf of 
our son, spepspepspep, he want to thank the citizens of the United 
States and the people of the world who've expressed their deepest 
sympathy and condolences to our family ring these trying times. A 
person has caring and loving as our son Matt would be overwhelmed 
by what this incident has done to the hearts and souls of people around 
the world. Matthew was the type of person that if this had happened 
to another person would have been the first on the scene to offer 
his help, his hope, and his heart to the family. We the family have 
no adequate way of expressing our gratitude for the thousands of E-mail 
comments, web site messages, phone calls, and cards offering help, 
consolation, sympathy, and support that we have received. We are honored 
and touched beyond measure. Please understand and respect my family's 
request for a private and dignified farewell to our son today. Matt's 
family and friends loved him deeply and we need to share a quiet gd-bye 
with him. Extraordinary statement by a very strong man who's been 
through hell over the past several days. Then this -- after the plea 
for privacy anti-gay protesters showed up across the street from where 
the mourners were gathering making an already solemn day very difficult. 
A delegation from the White House also attended the services.
