The United Nations has criticized the world's rich countries for doing 
too little to help the poor. A report by the U.N. Development Program 
says aid from the group of seven industrialized nations is at an all-time 
low. At the same time, the report says developing countries are burdened 
with crippling debts. One and a half billion people around the world 
earn less than $1 a day. At four minutes past the hour, this is Alan 
Dow in the BBC Newsroom in London. You're listening to "The World."
