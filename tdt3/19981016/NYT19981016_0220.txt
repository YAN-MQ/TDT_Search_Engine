John Paul II celebrated his 20th anniversary as pope Friday by revisiting 
his past. He appeared at a window at St. Peter's Basilica shortly 
before 7 p.m. as tens of thousands of well-wishers gathered beneath 
to hear and watch by live television hook-up the ringing of the bells 
of Krakow Cathedral, just as they had rung at the same time on Oct. 
16, 1978. In the morning, he held an emotional outdoor Mass at St. 
Peter's, packed with 25,000 Polish pilgrims. The 78-year-old pope 
drove in an open white papal jeep through cheering crowds holding 
up Polish flags and Solidarity banners _ nostalgic reminders of how 
in the earliest days of his pontificate, the pope embraced the cause 
of the independent Polish trade union that helped topple Communism. 
The pope, who 20 years ago said the words ``be not afraid'' at his 
inauguration Mass, is now frail, stooped, often in pain and shaking 
from the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. On Friday, he asked his 
fellow Poles for their help. ``For many years I have been preparing 
with the entire church to cross into the third millennium,'' the pope 
said. ``I ask you to pray so that I can carry to the end the work 
that God entrusted to me.'' ``From the hill of Wawel, Christ called 
me to the Hills of the Vatican, from the tomb of St. Stanislaus to 
the tomb of St. Peter, so that I could lead the church along the path 
to conciliar renewal,'' the pope said. ``My homeland's good is my 
good, what hurts it, dishonors it or threatens it becomes a part of 
me, a part of my heart, a part of my thoughts and a part of my feeling.'' 
He recalled how Polish prayers helped him recover from the assassination 
attempt on May 13, 1981, in the same square in which he spoke. ``It 
is difficult to speak of this without being overcome with emotion,'' 
he said. ``You were in prayer for all that time. You were then particularly 
united with me with binds of solidarity and spiritual closeness.'' 
John Paul II is the longest-serving pope in this century, and his 
pontificate has been marked by paradoxes. A charismatic leader who 
has traveled all over the world to restore evangelical zeal to the 
Catholic Church, he was a playwright, poet and intellectual who once 
wanted to join a monastery. A Pole who grew up in the shadow of Nazi 
totalitarianism and Communism, he used his pulpit to help defeat Communism. 
Once the Berlin Wall fell, he turned his attention and irritation 
on what he saw as the materialism, selfishness and social injustices 
of capitalism and Western society. His papacy is marked by a return 
to rigid conformity in doctrinal matters. He has tried to rein in 
Catholics on issues like abortion, homosexuality, priestly celibacy 
and women's ordination and has rigorously clamped down on dissent 
in dioceses and Catholic universities. Yet in his latest encyclical, 
``Fides et Ratio'' (``Faith and Reason''), issued on Thursday, the 
pope urged theologians to seek greater freedom of thought and philosophical 
inquiry to discover the truth as long as that truth is God. After 
a long day of celebration and commemorations on Italian television, 
John Paul gave a brief, quiet farewell. ``I want to give thanks for 
the last 20 years in the life of the Universal Church, the church 
and of course for my life,'' the pope said from his window on Thursday 
night.
