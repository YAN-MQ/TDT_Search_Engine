Funeral services are being held this afternoon for a gay college student 
beaten to death in Wyoming. Members of a Kansas Baptist church plan 
to hold an anti-homosexuality protest nearby. The casper city council 
has voted to ban picketing within 50 feet of the service. Police are 
using bomb-sniffing dogs to make sure the church is safe. Two young 
men are accused of beating Matthew shepard with a pistol and tying 
him to a fence. Police say the primary motive was robbery, but shepard 
may have been singled out because he was gay.
