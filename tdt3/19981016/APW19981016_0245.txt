Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki shot a 2-under-par 70 Friday and stayed atop 
the leaderboard with a four-stroke lead midway through the 110 million 
yen (dlrs 928,000) Nikkei Cup Torakichi Nakamura Memorial. Ozaki, 
seeking his third title of the season and 109th overall, had five 
birdies and three bogeys en route to a 9-under 135 total at the 7,072-yard 
(6,436-meter) Fuji Country Dejima Club course. American Brandt Jobe, 
in contention for his fourth victory on the Japan tour, fired a 69 
to share second place at 5-under 139 with Katsumasa Miyamoto, Toshimitsu 
Izawa and Katsunori Kuwabara. Another stroke back at 140 were Takashi 
Kamiyama, Yasuharu Imano and American Todd Hamilton. A total of 61 
players survived the cut at 2-over 146.
