As if Israeli warplanes menacing Lebanese skies were not enough, a 
new computer game about Israel's air force superiority invaded the 
Lebanese market. Authorities this week seized 10,000 copies of a CD-ROM 
titled Israeli air force, which was released on the 50th anniversary 
of its founding, the leading newspaper An-Nahar reported Friday. Five 
businessmen who allegedly bought the merchandise from Malaysia were 
ordered detained for questioning by Military Prosecutor Nasri Lahoud, 
An-Nahar said. The twin CD software has information about the defensive 
and offensive capabilities of the Israeli air force and a documentary 
of its operations against Arab countries since the creation of the 
Jewish state in 1948. It also has a game depicting fictitious bombing 
targets in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. An-Nahar said authorities blame 
``Israeli intelligence for sending the merchandise to Lebanon.'' It 
did not elaborate. Lebanon is technically at war with Israel whose 
troops occupy a border strip in the country's south. They fight almost 
daily with guerrillas trying to oust the foreign forces. Israeli warplanes, 
on daily reconnaissance missions over Lebanon, sometimes join ground 
forces in attacking the guerrillas. Lebanese are not allowed to travel 
to Israel or have contact with Israelis. It is a crime punishable 
by jail and even death. It is also a crime to sell Israeli merchandise 
or propagate for Israel, but the law is not clear on what the penalties 
are. However, there are no laws against selling pirated software, 
which is freely available here, largely imported from the Far East. 
An-Nahar said copies of the Israeli CDs cleared customs and appeared 
in computer shops in Beirut recently to the astonishment of many. 
The package was being sold for 20,000 pounds (dlrs 13). Genuine software 
sells for anywhere between dlrs 20 and dlrs 150.
