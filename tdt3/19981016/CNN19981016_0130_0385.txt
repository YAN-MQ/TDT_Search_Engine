In San Fernando, California, the district attorney is trying to decide 
whether to charge a man for his courtroom outburst. Christopher wegman 
had to be tackled by deputies when he charged the man who killed his 
mother. He was mad because he thought the man was refusing to make 
eye contact with him. Christopher DeHuff was sentenced to 21 1/2 years 
in prison for fleeing from police and causing the car wreck that killed 
the woman.
