Matthew shepard's death has sparked nationwide debate over prejudice 
and hate in our society. Some web sites are giving people opportunities 
to discuss this and other sensitive issues. Marsha Walton takes a 
look in this edition of "tech trends." Relatives of Matthew shepard 
say they're astonished by the worldwide response to his death. We, 
the family, have no adequate way of expressing our gratitude for the 
thousands of E-mails, comments, web site messages, phone calls and 
cards offering help, consolation, sympathy and support. All over the 
Internet, shepard's death has launched some Frank talk about tolerance 
and gay bashing. People will love this site or hate it, there's not 
much in between. Since spring of this year, Phillip Milano's "yforum" 
web site has dealt head on with stereotypes and simple misunderstandings 
about sexuality, race and religion. Questions most would be too embarrassed 
to ask a real person. This site is not for the faint of heart. It's 
provocative. Sometimes I wince when I put these questions up, but 
inevitably when someone responds, and responds patiently and honestly, 
there's a learning experience there. Questions like -- how do straight 
men feel about other men flirting with them? Why is it that a devout 
Jew won't eat cheese on meat? I've noticed a lot of Asian people don't 
date people of other races. Is that a cultural rule or something? 
Milano says he's especially hopeful young people start dealing with 
all levels of misunderstanding. And some are. I think people are afraid 
of what they don't know. Atlanta's student written "vox" newspaper 
and web site tackles racism, homophobia and religious intolerance. 
The content is often an eye-opener for teenagers. It woke me up to 
sort of realize that not everyone fits under one category. And our 
differences are really in our imagination. But these students are 
learning discrimination and intolerance are not imaginary. A painful 
lesson also for the family of Matthew shepard. Marsha Walton, CNN.
