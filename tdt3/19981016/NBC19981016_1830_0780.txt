NBC news "in depth" -- tonight, a funeral for a young life cut short 
by a horrible crime. It was just nine days ago that Matthew shepard, 
a 21-year-old gay college student, was found tied to a fence in a 
field in Wyoming. He struggled to survive a brutal beating but lost 
that fight. Two young men have been charged murder one in what many 
are calling a hate crime. We begin our "in depth" reporting with NBC's 
Roger O'Neil in casper, Wyoming. Under heavy guard and a steady rain, 
Matthew shepard was laid to rest -- -- even as his death continues 
to provoke anger over a hate crime and protests over sexual orientation. 
In their first public statement, shepard's parents plead for privacy. 
We should try to remember that because Matthew's last few minutes 
of consciousness on earth may have been hell, his family and friends 
want more than ever to say their farewells to him in a peaceful, dignified 
and loving manner. Shepard made no mention of his son's homosexuality 
and took no questions. But as the young boy's mother, Judy, sobbed, 
the father spoke, not of hate, but of his son's loving heart. Matthew 
was the type of person that if this had happened to another person 
would have been the first on the scene to offer his help, his hope 
and his heart to the family. Despite pleading for a dignified good-bye, 
outside the Episcopal church here in casper, where shepard was baptized, 
an ugly confrontation of words between a few who chose to demonstrate 
against gays and those who came to mourn Matthew shepard. As the funeral 
began, in a show of compassion to the family, some formed a human 
chain between the demonstrators and the church to make sure the dignity 
of the service inside wasn't disrupted. As the snow turned fall's 
brilliant colors to a fresh white, Matthew shepard, a young man few 
had heard of one week ago today, was remembered. His killing, an ugly 
reminder of hate. Roger O'Neil, NBC news, casper, Wyoming.
