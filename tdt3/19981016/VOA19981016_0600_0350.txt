From Washington, this is VOA News Now. I'm Frank Whitis. A summit 
meeting designed to restart the Middle East peace process is being 
held in a rural conference center on the eastern shore of the state 
of Maryland. VOA Correspondent, Gil Butler is covering the event. 
Serving at the head of a U-shaped table, President Clinton presided 
at the opening of the Middle East peace talks in the Colonial era 
Wye Plantation. The talks are aimed at reaching some interim agreements 
between Israelis and Palestinians in the words of Mr. Clinton, "to 
get the peace process moving". Pres. BILL CLINTON: There is hard work 
ahead if we are to reach an agreement here and get the peace process 
moving again. Secretary Albright and I and our entire team are ready 
to do whatever we can. Mr. Clinton made official what his spokesman 
had been saying for days that helped to put a tight lid on information 
leaks. He said the participants have agreed to confined dealings with 
the news media to periodic briefings by official spokesmen. News reporters 
are being kept at the college, five kilometers away from the conference 
site. Like the historic Camp David meetings, these Middle East talks 
are at a bucolic, isolate site, about a hundred kilometers from Washington. 
It is close enough for the President to shuttle back and forth during 
the three or four days the talks are expected to last. In his absence, 
Secretary of State Albright will represent the Americans in the negotiations. 
Though details, by design, are skimpy, reports say they are discussing 
a detailed security plan to show Palestinian commitment to combating 
attacks on Israelis. According to those reports, Israeli withdrawal 
from 13 percent more occupied land would be tied to implementation 
of the security plan. Gil Butler, VOA News on the Eastern Shore of 
Maryland.
