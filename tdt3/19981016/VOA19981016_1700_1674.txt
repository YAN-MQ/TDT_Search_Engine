Some people steal library books. But one man in Concord, New Hampshire, 
has admitted to stealing just the front and back pages of books. William 
Lenihan is an autograph dealer. He pleaded guilty to criminal mischief, 
for ripping pages from 300 library books. Mr. Lenihan says he doesn't 
know why he did it. But police and prosecutors have a different theory. 
Blank pages from aging books could be useful services for forging 
autographs. Mr. Lenihan denied that he used the stolen pages for forgeries. 
And making his guilty plea in Concord, Mr. Lenihan agreed to pay a 
fine of $1200 and make additional restitution to the library. The 
Universal Autograph Collector's Club has expelled him in the past. 
After one of his customers brought an ethics complaint against him. 
Unfortunately, I hope he doesn't rip out the last page of the story. 
That's annoying, when you don't get the conclusion. That could be 
very annoying. Well, I hope they take his library card away from him. 
That's what I hope. Oh, well, that would be a terrible punishment.
