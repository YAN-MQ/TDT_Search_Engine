The government says it may not be prepared for acts of domestic terrorism 
and the FBI is taking steps to remedy that. Tokyo 1995. A devastating 
Sarin gas attack kills eight and sickens thousands, including some 
of the initial rescue personnel rushing in to save lives. It's exactly 
the scenario which gives Arlington county fire chief Ed plaugher nightmares. 
We are not ready for the out of the ordinary, chemical or biological 
or nuclear terrorist attack. The first responders do not have the 
protection equipment necessary to do their job. The U.S. is engaged 
in the most massive anti-terror buildup in the nation's history. But 
despite the millions spent, some fear the money is not flowing to 
where it's needed most. To those first on the scene. 85% of the nation's 
rescue workers are volunteers often struggling for resources. When 
these fire departments can't even afford to buy updated equipment 
and maintain the quality of their equipment, how do expect them to 
have the resources necessary to handle these situations? Fire and 
rescue officials say they need more -- training, equipment to detect 
chemical or biological agents, protective clothing and decontamination 
gear. Friday the justice department responded, announcing the creation 
of a new FBI office. Its goal -- to better coordinate the more than 
two-dozen federal agencies responding to domestic terrorism and to 
marry their programs to state and local efforts. I want this new office 
to be a center for assistance and solutions, not a new bureaucracy. 
The FBI will work with local officials to develop training standards, 
provide a national response plan, assess equipment needs and eventually 
provide funding. But some worry the nation is a playing a desperate 
game of catch up against an emerging threat that is very real. It's 
not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. These incidents next occur. 
And plaugher says, Oklahoma City taught the nation domestic terrorism 
can happen anywhere even the heartland. Pierre Thomas, CNN.
