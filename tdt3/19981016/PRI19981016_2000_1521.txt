The heat's on for Europe to follow the Fed's lead and cut interest 
rates. I'm Liz George at the business desk in New York. Stock markets 
around the world were driven skyward by the surprise rates cut in 
the U.S. But after the initial excitement, European bourses dipped, 
as the dollar slipped against the German mark. And it's on Europe 
that the world's financial scrutiny will now be focused, as pressure 
mounts for interest rate cuts there. John Ryding is the senior economist 
for Bear Stearns. He says Britain could be next. The UK will follow, 
where the rates are far higher than in the U.S., with official rates 
of 7 1/4 percent, compared to the Fed funds rate at five percent. 
And maybe even Europe will follow, if the cut in rates here enables 
the mark to strengthen a bit more against the dollar. European rates 
are too high, even at 3.3 percent in France and Germany.
