The U.S. Department of Agriculture wants to stop the Asian longhorn 
beetle in its tracks. The USDA has established new rules that require 
wood packaging bound for the U.S., be treated with heat, fumigation, 
and preservatives. The longhorn beetle, native to China, Japan, and 
Korea, has already infiltrated the United States in shipping materials. 
And has destroyed trees in several states. USDA inspector Hal Fingerman, 
at the Port of Philadelphia says the Asian longhorn beetle makes the 
gypsy moth look like pussycat. Referring to the leaf-eating European 
moth that entered the U.S. 10 years ago, it is now found in half the 
country. With U.S. Environment Briefs, I'm Roseanne Skirble.
