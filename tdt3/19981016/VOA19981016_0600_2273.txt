U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is sending an investigative team 
to Yugoslavia to ensure he has firsthand information on conditions 
there. VOA United Nations Correspondent, Max Rustin reports. Mr. Annan 
has been asked by the U.N. Security Council to supply regular reports 
on the situation in Kosovo and the degree of compliance with council 
resolutions. In his most recent report, given to the council at the 
start of this month, Mr. Annan stated that he did not have the means 
necessary to provide an independent assessment of compliance. Because 
he said he lacked a direct political presence on the ground in Kosovo. 
The council then urged him to establish such a presence. U.N. Spokesman, 
Fred Eckard. In response to the security council's request last week, 
the Secretary General has decided as we've already announced to send 
a mission to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to explore the secretariat's 
firsthand capability, to assess developments on the ground and to 
continue reporting to the Security Council on the compliance by the 
FRY with it's resolutions on Kosovo. The team is expected to prepare 
recommendations for establishing the mechanism that will provide regular 
firsthand information on the situation in Kosovo to the U.N. Secretary 
General. The team will be lead by the director of the U.N. Information 
Center in Rome, Stefan Demustura who has also assisted with problems 
concerning the inspection of controversial suspected weapon sites 
in Iraq. Mr. Demustura's mission is expected to arrive in Yugoslavia 
over the weekend and to spend about a week in the region. Max Rustin,
