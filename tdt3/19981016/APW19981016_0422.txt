President Emil Constantinescu recalled Friday Romania's ambassadors 
from India, Poland, Moldova and Malaysia without giving any official 
explanation. ``We cannot speculate on the reasons of these changes,'' 
said Pavel Platona a director in Foreign Ministry. Foreign Minister 
Andrei Plesu promised last year to change by the year 2000 the diplomats 
who served the communist regime which was ousted in 1989. He also 
said he would replace those diplomats who did not do their job properly.
