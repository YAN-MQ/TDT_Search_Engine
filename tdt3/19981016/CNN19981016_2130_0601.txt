Just in time to watch the world series from home, Darryl Strawberry 
was released from the hospital today. He had surgery two weeks ago 
to remove a cancerous tumor from his colon. The 36-year-old New York 
Yankees outfielder lost weight while in the hospital, but he says 
he feels great. He is expected to undergo chemotherapy next, and doctors 
are giving him a good chance for a full recovery.
