Russian steel companies appealed to U.S. Vice President Al Gore not 
to impose anti-dumping measures against imports of Russian hot-rolled 
carbon steel, a news agency said Friday. In an open letter to Gore 
and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the four companies called 
the measures ``hostile actions'' that ``threaten the potential of 
Russian metallurgy and put market relations ... in jeopardy,'' the 
Interfax news agency reported. Leading U.S. steel companies have recently 
accused Japan, Russia and Brazil of dumping steel on the U.S. market 
at prices dramatically below production costs and prices at home, 
saying it has caused layoffs and lower profits at American plants. 
Twelve companies joined the United Steelworkers in petitioning the 
Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission for 
intervention. Russian steelworkers have responded that Russian steel 
is more expensive in the United States than in Russia, so there are 
no need for trade sanctions. Four Russian steel companies asked Gore 
and Primakov to hold talks on a long-term agreement that would resolve 
the problem, Interfax reported. Metal exports by the four companies 
_ Severalstal, Novolipetsk Metallurgical Complex, Magnitogorsk Metallurgic 
Complex and NOSTA _ make up more than 7 percent of Russia's foreign 
currency revenues, the report said. The leader of Russia's Mining 
and Metallurgical Union, Mikhail Tarasenko, has said that more than 
100,000 Russians would lose their jobs and the country would lose 
dlrs 1 billion in revenue if steel exports fall. Russia is the world's 
fourth-largest steel producer.
