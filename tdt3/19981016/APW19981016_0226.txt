Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura will spend the weekend working 
toward a World War II peace treaty with Russia, which the two countries 
have never signed. President Boris Yeltsin has promised that a treaty 
will be signed by 2000, although it hinges on solving a dispute over 
the Kuril Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war 
off Russia's Pacific coast. There have been no signs of progress on 
resolving the disagreement on the Kuril Islands despite the overall 
improvement in relations. In an interview published Friday, Komura 
said Russian-Japanese relations have made progress due to summits 
between Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and Japan's former-Prime 
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. ``In Russian-Japanese relations ... there 
has been a continuous dialogue on a high level,'' Komura told the 
daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Komura, who was to arrive in Moscow on 
Friday night, is expected to meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and other top officials, the Interfax 
news agency reported. The visit comes one day after Russia's parliament 
voted to reinstate a holiday marking the defeat of Japan in World 
War II. The holiday had been dropped after the Soviet collapse. The 
upper chamber of parliament, the Federation Council, agreed to reestablish 
the Day of Victory Over Militarist Japan, which marks the Soviet Union's 
defeat of Japan on Sept. 3, 1945, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
The measure, which has already been approved by the lower house, requires 
President Boris Yeltsin's signature to become law.
