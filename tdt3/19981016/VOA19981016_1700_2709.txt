Help is on the way for the Florida Everglades. This week, the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers announced a plan to spend 8 billion dollars 
over the next twenty years. To restore Florida's Everglades. One of 
the most endangered ecosystems in the United States. This land of 
sawgrass, marshes, pine forest islands, mangroves and low lying coastal 
waters, is home to tens of thousands of plant and animal species. 
And of nature's most efficient natural water treatment systems. However, 
with the construction of dikes and levies for agricultural production 
and urban developments since the 1950's, the Everglades has shrunk 
to half its original size. Five million people in South Florida depend 
on the Everglades for their water supply. As does the booming 20 billion 
dollar recreational tourist economy. Big agricultural interests generally 
agree that unless something is done, they too will face a major water 
shortage. Stewart Strahl is the executive director of the National 
Audobon Society's Everglades' Conservation Office. I think we have 
a really good chance now of spreading the word. Letting people know 
that is not just about an endangered ecosystem. It is for us environmentalists. 
But for the world, it's setting a precedence of how much we're willing 
to invest right now for these incredible benefits of having a sustainable 
South Florida. The Army Corps of Engineers recommends major land acquisition 
to restore the historic natural water flow in the 2.4 million hectare 
region. The plan proposes filling in canals, removing levies and pump 
stations. And storing water in underground aquifers in a massive lagoon. 
Eighty-five percent of the fresh water that now drains to the ocean, 
would be saved and managed for the benefit of the Everglades and to 
supplement the water supply for the urban east coast of South Florida.
