Ukraine's gross domestic product fell sharply in September, contributing 
to its overall decrease in the first nine months of 1998 compared 
to the same period last year, officials said Friday. The country's 
GDP in January through September was 0.5 percent lower than in the 
same period last year after contracting by 5 percent in September 
alone, the State Statistics Committee reported. The reduction followed 
a slight but steady increase in GDP this year, which signaled the 
former Soviet republic's first economic growth since 1989. However, 
Ukraine was badly hit by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia 
last month, and the country's economy is expected to shrink again 
this year.
