There still appears to be ripples from the federal reserve's cut in 
interest rates yesterday. People in the money business are still trying 
to understand what that cut will really mean. Here's ABC's Betsy Stark. 
There was clear evidence today of what lowering interest rates, even 
a little, can do. It wasn't just the Dow that climbed. Asian and European 
markets rallied, interpreting Mr. Greenspan's move as a show of leadership 
in the global economic crisis. Merrill Lynch, the biggest brokerage 
firm in America, has put banks back on its "buy" list after months 
of avoiding them. Lower rates are good for the banking business. One 
day later, the tiny interest rate cut has taken a bite out of the 
Negative psychology that has been plaguing Wall Street. Seeing the 
fed moving quickly like this, surprising the markets, makes me more 
optimistic and less inclined to worry about recession risk. But there 
are limits to what a small cut in interest rates can do. It cannot 
stop rumors, circulating again today, that big banks are in trouble. 
And it may not cvince reluctant lenders at banks and brokerage firms 
that their balance sheets are secure enough to start taking risks 
again. Many lenders of all kinds are concerned about the loans they 
have extended, and whether some of them that they thought were sound 
are gonna turn out to be unsound, in fact, turn bad. But perhaps the 
biggest question this day after the rate cut is, what prompted Mr. 
Greenspan to act? With all the gloomy news already out there, is there 
something else he knows that we don't? Betsy Stark, ABC News, New 
York.
