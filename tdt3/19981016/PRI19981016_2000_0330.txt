A senior Argentinean official says a solution to the long-running 
border dispute between Peru and Ecuador could be imposed in a matter 
of days. The official was speaking after legislatures in both countries 
accepted a binding settlement to the conflict. Peru and Ecuador are 
now obliged to accept any peace plan drawn up by Brazil, Argentina, 
Chile and the United States. All four are neutral guarantors of a 
1942 treaty that set the border between Peru and Ecuador. This is 
"The World."
