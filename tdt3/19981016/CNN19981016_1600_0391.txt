NATO has extended by 10 days tomorrow's deadline for the withdrawal 
of Yugoslavian forces from the province of Kosovo. But officials say 
war planes will remain ready for possible air strikes if Yugoslavia 
does not end its crackdown on ethnic Albanians. Yugoslavia today agreed 
to let 2,000 unarmed monitors into Kosovo. They will check to see 
that Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic is keeping his cease-fire 
agreement.
