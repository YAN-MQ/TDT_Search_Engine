Unarmed NATO planes could begin reconnaissance flights over Kosovo 
beginning today to monitor an agreement to end the violence there. 
The accord allowing the flights is to ensure Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic complies with demands to withdraw his forces from the province. 
NATO and the Yugoslav military signed the deal yesterday in Belgrade. 
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana says the alliance knows of many 
army and special police units still in Kosovo and that those units 
must be withdrawn immediately.
