The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army rejected Friday a U.S.-brokered 
deal with Serbia, saying it will not end President Slobodan Milosevic's 
crackdown in his troubled province. ``The agreement does nothing but 
provide Milosevic leverage to continue with war, genocide, massacres 
and the deepening of the humanitarian crisis,'' Hashim Thaci, a member 
of the KLA's political wing told The Associated Press. Thaci said 
that the KLA demands that NATO and the U.N. force Serb troops to withdraw 
``from all positions'' in Kosovo from where they threaten the return 
of refugees and the freedom of movement. ``If this is not done, the 
UCK (KLA in Albanian) will continue the armed struggle for freedom, 
independence and democracy,'' Thaci said, reading the KLA's latest 
announcement. The agreement between Yugoslav President Milosevic and 
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke envisages a partial withdrawal of Serb 
troops from Kosovo, the safe return of tens of thousands refugees 
and a 2,000-strong international verification mission. Ethnic Albanian 
moderate political leader Ibrahim Rugova appealed Friday for ``all 
Kosovars, and their political and other groups to accept'' the OSCE 
monitoring force. His reference to the ``other groups'' was clearly 
addressed to the KLA. Thaci said the KLA demands it be included in 
the negotiations between the Kosovo ethnic Albanian community and 
Belgrade because they are ``a crucial factor on the Albanian side. 
``The KLA will punish any individual or group which dares sign an 
agreement contrary to the will of our people expressed in the 1991 
(officially unauthorized) referendum,'' Thaci said, referring to a 
vote in which Kosovo's Albanians overwhelmingly opted to secede from 
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
