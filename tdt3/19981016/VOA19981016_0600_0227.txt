Thursday's surprised interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve 
and the subsequent surge on Wall Street has sent stock markets soaring 
across Asia. Share prices in Tokyo posted their first gains in four 
trading days, advancing more than 2 percent. Markets in Singapore 
and Hong Kong surged more than 7 percent in the morning session. Following 
the cut and two key U.S. interest rates Thursday, stock prices on 
Wall Street shot up more than 4 percent.
