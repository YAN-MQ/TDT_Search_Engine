Well, that's it for today, I'm Brian Sislack, hoping you'll join me 
next time for another edition of Science World. It's 10:49 Universal 
Time. Here's the major news story we're following this hour. The prestigious 
1998 Noble Peace Prize has been awarded to David Trimble and John 
Hume of Northern Ireland for their part in working to settle the long 
running Sectarian Dispute. We'll have an update on that story in about 
eleven minutes at eleven hours Universal Time.
