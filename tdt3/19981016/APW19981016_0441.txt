Japan's prime minister said Friday he met with the U.S. ambassador 
to express his regrets over the death of an Okinawan teen-ager in 
a hit-and-run in which an American serviceman has been charged. Yuki 
Uema, 18, died Wednesday from head injuries, one week after the accident. 
Police say U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge was driving drunk 
when he struck Uema's small motorcycle. ``The accident on Okinawa 
was extremely painful,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said in a nationally 
televised speech. ``I pray for Miss Uema from the depth of my heart.'' 
Obuchi said he relayed his ``strong regrets'' to Ambassador Thomas 
Foley. Foley has expressed his condolences to the Uema family. Eskridge, 
23, of LaPorte, Indiana, has been charged with hit-and-run, driving 
under the influence of alcohol and causing injury through professional 
negligence. Eskridge's lawyer, Miyatomi Harushima, suggested his client 
would not fight the charges in court, although he declined to say 
specifically how he would plead. ``I don't foresee major contests 
in this case,'' Harushima said Friday in a telephone interview from 
Okinawa. Harushima said he was most worried about how Eskridge was 
coping in a foreign jail, but it was unclear whether he would be released 
on bail. Japanese and U.S. officials are eager to prevent the hit-and-run 
from flaring up into another catalyst for anger among the residents 
of Okinawa against the U.S. military. Okinawans have long resented 
having most of the American troops in Japan stationed on their tiny 
island, 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) southwest of Tokyo. Their outrage 
erupted after the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan girl, in which 
three U.S. servicemen were convicted. Uema's funeral services were 
held Friday. Lt. Gen. Frank Libutti, commander of Marine Corps bases 
in Japan, attended, the Marines said. The date for Eskridge's trial 
has not yet been set. Under Japanese law, a conviction on injuring 
someone while driving carries a maximum penalty of up to five years 
in prison or a 500,000 yen (dlrs 4,300) fine. The hit-and-run includes 
other charges such as failure to report an accident, which carries 
a maximum penalty of three months in jail or a 5,000 yen (dlrs 40) 
fine.
