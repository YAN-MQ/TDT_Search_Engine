American Lindsay Davenport displayed the form which earned her the 
No. 1 ranking on the WTA Tour earlier this week, taking only 58 minute 
to rout 13th-ranked Amanda Coetzer 6-3, 6-1 Friday and reach the semifinals 
of the European Championships. It was Davenport's seventh straight 
victory over the South African, but the American said she was feeling 
a little extra pressure resulting from her new status. ``There's pressure 
to defend the points, to defend the title, and to try not to let the 
lead go,'' said Davenport, who officially passed Martina Hingis as 
No. 1 on Monday. ``Hopefully you don't put too much pressure on yourself 
and say `you've got to win the tournament now that you're one.' ``You 
mustn't think `I'm No. 1, I've got to win,' or `I can't lose to this 
person, I'm No. 1,' because it would all fall apart,'' the U.S. Open 
champion said. ``Inevitably now when I lose, I'll lose to someone 
ranked below me.'' There was little sign that Davenport's new status 
was rattling her Friday. In fact, it was Coetzer who appeared to crumble, 
holding serve just once in the entire match. Getting off to a forceful 
start, Davenport broke the South African teice to jump to a 3-0 lead. 
But taking advantage of a dip in Davenport's focus, a scrappy Coetzer 
rallied to break back twice and even the score. The comeback seemed 
to rekindle Davenport's zeal, the American winning the next three 
games to take the set. Davenport continued her domination in the second 
set, winning the first four games before Coetzer was able to break 
the American once to somewhat narrow the gap. Coetzer's defiance was 
short-lived, however, as Davenport broke right back, winning the next 
two games to wrap up the match. ``I lost my concentration and missed 
a few easy balls,'' said Davenport, who has lost just one set in her 
last seven matches against Coetzer. ``But once I won that next game 
and went up another break that was the turning point. ``I probably 
shouldn't have let it get to that point, but for the rest I played 
pretty well.'' The victory extended Davenport's five-year winning 
streak in Switzerland to 14 victories. Her run began at the 1993 European 
Open in Lucerne, where she captured her first career title at the 
age of 16. Davenport went on to defend that title in 1994 before winning 
in Zurich last year. The winner of five titles this season, Davenport 
will meet Irina Spirlea in the semifinals, the Romanian trampling 
eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost 6-4, 6-0 in her quarterfinal. Spirlea 
needed just 53 minutes to cruise past the Belgian, who ended Martina 
Hingis's reign atop the world rankings when she upset the Swiss star 
in the quarterfinals of Filderstadt last week. In later quarterfinal 
matches, American Venus Williams, seeded second, took on seventh-seed 
Mary Pierce, and fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat of France met Austria's 
Barbara Schett.
