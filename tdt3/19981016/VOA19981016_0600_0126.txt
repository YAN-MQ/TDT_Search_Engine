The two Irishmen, John Hume and David Trimble awarded the Noble Peace 
Prize today. The announcement came from Oslo, Norway, decided to award 
by the two men to bring about the peace in the British province of 
Northern Ireland. Hume, a Catholic, was a social democrat and labor 
party leader. And David Trimble, a Protestant, is a Northern Ireland 
First Minister. We have more from VOA's Paul Franchuck. Two men, one 
Catholic, the other, Protestant, worked tirelessly toward reaching 
the historic Northern Ireland Peace Accord signed this past April 
10th. Speaking after the announcement, John Hume generously shared 
credit. The expression of total endorsement of the work of very many 
people. The work of both governments and all of the parties. Because 
there have been a very concerted effort to bring peace and stability 
to our streets. And I think that today's announcement from the Noble 
Committee strengthens our peacefulness enormously because it tells 
all the people what the world wants to see. John Hume and David Trimble 
will share the $955,000 Noble Peace Prize and will receive their award 
in Oslo this December. Paul Franchuck, VOA News, London.
