For "The World," this is Alan Dow in the BBC Newsroom in London. This 
year's Nobel Prize is shared by the leaders of the Northern Ireland's 
two-largest political parties: John Hume and David Trimble. Mr. Hume 
leader of the biggest Catholic party, the SDLP, says the Nobel Peace 
Prize will strengthen the peace process. I see this award as a very 
powerful endorsement of the peace process and of peace on our streets. 
And I think it will strengthen the peace process quite enormously 
because it underlines a massive international goodwill towards it. 
Mr. Hume was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize, as David Trimble, leader 
of the mainly Protestant Alster Unionist Party. Mr. Trimble has welcomed 
the award, but warned most of the work is still ahead. The process 
is not complete. We cannot say, with absolute certainty and -- now 
and today that there is real peace in an assured way. There is work 
still to be done. I hope this work doesn't turn out to be premature. 
David Trimble of the Alster Unionist Party.
