White House sources say U-2 planes will begin monitoring the withdrawal 
of Serb forces from Kosovo tomorrow. NATO has extended the deadline 
for the pullback of Serb forces until October 27th. It originally 
was set for 11:00 P.M. eastern time tonight. The U.S. state department 
says Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic has made some concessions, 
but NAto forces still are prepared to launch air strikes if he fails 
to live up to his agreement.
