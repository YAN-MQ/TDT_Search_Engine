The federal aviation administration has recommended that airplane 
manufacturers replace the insulation material on all its commercial 
aircrafts. The move comes after the crash of Swissair flight 111, 
which killed all 229 people on board. Gary Tuchman has more. Inside 
an aircraft hangar in southern New Jersey, the federal aviation administration 
conducts testing for fires in aircraft. On the left, an old Boeing 
707, on the right, the front portion of an old dc-10, where testing 
currently under way involves the flammability of seats. But the testing 
under scrutiny now is what you're seeing -- the examination of how 
quickly airplane insulation catches ablaze. The FAA had started the 
testing before the crash of Swissair flight 111, but in a telephone 
conference call on Thursday declared that -- We determined it was 
appropriate to accelerate the research. There is no evidence insulation 
caused the Swissair crash, but the FAA is now recommending that the 
insulation of virtually all passenger jets and the wrapping material 
that covers it be replaced as soon as possible. The FAA says it's 
the wrapping material that is the main concern. The testing has shown 
that it is the casing material, the wrapping material, that can propagate 
the fire. That material is made of metallic mylar. The FAA's preliminary 
testing has identified two safer materials -- fiberglass and a material 
called curlon. So it may be safe to say that we can't find anything 
totally flameproof, but we can probably do a better job than we're 
doing now. The world's largest aircraft manufacturer agrees. We see 
the FAA's action as a good opportunity to incrementally raise the 
safety level of insulation blankets that we have on our airplanes 
today. The FAA will continue its insulation testing here for another 
six months. By the time its done, the agency will likely have insulated 
itself from any criticism it hasn't done enough about this issue.
