The financial stakes cannot compare with Monopoly. There is no chance 
for global domination as in Risk. It may feel like a life-or-death 
matter, but there's almost never a murder, as in Clue. It's just academia, 
after all. But for those who think university politics revolve around 
an elaborate sense of gamesmanship all their own, there is now Survival 
of the Witless, a combination board game and academic sendup based 
on the premise that ``Knowledge is Nothing. Tenure is Everything.'' 
Produced by a former history teacher who now works for Avalanche Press, 
a small Virginia-based company best known for making war games, Survival 
of the Witless has a simple goal _ gaining tenure. It is described 
as ``the key to fame, wealth, happiness and most importantly to never 
having to put in a single day's work again.'' But if the goal is simple, 
the rules are convoluted enough that the game probably works best 
as niche marketing _ more fun for those with tenure or aspiring to 
it than to the average fan of Trivial Pursuit or Parcheesi. Survival 
of the Witless was created by a former college history professor who 
labored at a large Southern university but never managed to get a 
job in which he could aim for tenure. He says he wants to remain anonymous 
in case he decides to try again. ``Academia lends itself to game form, 
because there's a defined goal, getting tenure, and it's important 
to get it before your enemies,'' the game's creator said. ``It's highly 
competitive, and its highly structured. It's played on two tracks, 
gaining status and completing your book, so the game is played the 
same way.'' The aim of the game, as in academia itself, is currying 
favor with enough professors to gain tenure. In this case, players 
need to finish a book and get the vote of three of five members of 
the faculty-review committee, whose tolerance for or aversion to various 
behaviors vary with their politics, gender, race and sexual orientation. 
They include such characters as R. Jackson Wentworth, who has not 
taught a course since Herbert Hoover was president; Lana Wong, who 
is facing multiple sexual harassment suits, and Ricard Bergamo, known 
as One Book Willy, who has spent a career recycling his one semi-famous 
book. Players draw cards toward publishing a book and pleasing committee 
members, who reflect the game's scabrous view of academic life. Most 
of the jockeying reflects a zero-sum game, where one person's good 
fortune is usually at the expense of his rivals. Good teaching is 
the equivalent of landing on someone else's hotel on Boardwalk in 
Monopoly. The ``Student Support'' card, gained when students clamor 
for a player to teach more courses, means the player loses a status 
point with all faculty members. On the other hand, a ``Student Boycott'' 
card, reflecting teaching so dreadful that students refuse to register 
for classes, means the lucky scholar has more time to divert from 
worthless teaching to valuable writing. Players who draw the ``Student 
Boycott'' card get to take writing cards from two other players, who 
presumably are stuck in the classroom instead of at the word processor. 
Valuable cards include being published in the New York Review of Each 
Other's Books, getting a cherished research grant or having your course 
load reduced. The most frequently used desirable card is represented 
by a kiss planted on the rear end of a donkey, apparently the surest 
road to success in the game. A ``Graduate Assistant'' card, denoting 
someone to do your work, is good. A ``Would You Like Fries With That?'' 
card, indicating that the graduate student has left to enter a work 
force that has no use for his academic skills, is bad. A ``Bold New 
Theory'' card is good. A ``Theory Debunked'' card, which can be played 
by another player proving your theory is not bold, new or correct, 
is bad. Other recurring issues include a gossip card (powerful, but 
perilous), a seduction card (see gossip) and other variations on inappropriate 
gender-related behavior, like the ``Eye Rape'' card in which you lose 
a point with all faculty members for looking at an attractive student. 
The game's creator concedes that if the game has a bitter tinge, it 
reflects his own unhappy experience in university politics. Still, 
the game does seem to have some broader appeal. Thanks in part to 
a story in the Chronicle of Higher Education, most of the 3,000 games 
originally produced have been sold, he said. ``Don't get me wrong,'' 
said the game's creator, who said his own taste in games ran to poker 
and German board games. ``I take higher education seriously. It's 
an honor and a privilege to be allowed to teach college kids, and 
it angers me that there are people who view it as a sinecure and a 
guaranteed paycheck for no work. So the game reflects that. It's why 
the teaching award is the nastiest card in the deck. It's what cost 
me my job. I got a teaching award, and it was over. It truly was.'' 
His one nugget of strategic advice? ``Everyone is your enemy,'' he 
said.
