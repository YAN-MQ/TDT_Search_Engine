a separate section of the Mexican Foreign Ministry report noted that 
40 Mexican citizens in 11 U.S. states have been sentenced to death. 
Mexico regards the death penalty as a human rights issue since it 
is not legal here. However, a sharp increase in kidnappings, murders, 
and violent assaults in recent years has lead to demands that the 
death penalty be restored. On Wednesday, a proposal was put before 
the Mexican Congress by a ruling party deputy to restore the death 
penalty for kidnappers who either kill or mutilate their victims. 
Mexico currently ranks number one in the world for kidnappings and 
ranks among the top ten nations in murder per capita. Greg Flakus, 
VOA News, Mexico City.
