Thailand's finance minister and central bank governor said Friday 
the baht may continue to rise against the dollar, buoyed by U.S. interest 
rate cuts, a trade surplus and foreign inflows of capital. The Thai 
currency on Friday morning rose to its highest level in 11 months, 
trading at 37.85 to the U.S. dollar. It traded Friday afternoon at 
37.925, just off Thursday's close of 37.905. The Asian economic crisis 
began in Thailand in mid-1997 with a devaluation of the baht which 
had long stood at around 25 baht to the U.S. dollar. The recent strengthening 
of the baht was in line with most regional currencies after a sudden 
cut in U.S. interest rates, dealers said. Finance Minister Tarrin 
Nimmanahaeminda said Friday he expected the baht to continue strengthening 
as the United States implements further easing of monetary policy. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday cut the overnight rate on loans 
between banks, the U.S. federal funds rate, to 5 percent. It also 
lowered the discount rate on its own loans to banks by a quarter point 
to 4.75 percent. Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul said 
at a news conference that the country's average monthly trade surplus 
above dlrs 900 million and foreign direct investment of dlrs 400 million 
continued to exert upward pressure on the baht. Although a stronger 
baht will make it easier for Thai companies to service huge levels 
of foreign debt, analysts said the government is worried exports will 
decline as they become more expensive in dollar terms. ``The central 
bank doesn't want the baht to appreciate too much. Any (economic) 
recovery will be more or less led by exports,'' said CIC Bank analyst 
Philip Chang in Singapore. Finance Minister Tarrin said Friday exports 
to the United States likely would decline on the baht's strength but 
exports to the region shouldn't be hurt, as other Southeast Asian 
currencies also are strengthening against the dollar. Thio Chin Loo, 
an analyst at Banque Paribas in Singapore, said the baht could benefit 
from lower U.S. interest rates as capital looks for higher returns 
in emerging markets. ``I wouldn't be surprised if the dollar goes 
below this year's low of 37.70 baht to the dollar,'' she said. Thailand's 
interest rates, although now coming down slightly, remain among the 
highest in the region, the legacy of a tight monetary policy dictated 
by the terms of a dlrs 17.2 billion International Monetary Fund economic 
bailout package.
