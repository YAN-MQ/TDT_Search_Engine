A Danish museum agreed to pay an art dealer 250,000 kronor (dlrs 40,850) 
to buy a tuna fish-size can filled with excrement that started leaking 
after it was borrowed for an exhibit, both sides announced. The settlement 
ends legal wrangling between Randers Arts Museum, which borrowed the 
Italian artistic endeavor entitled ``Merda d'Artista,'' and dealer 
John Hunov, who lent it. The contents came from Piero Manzoni (1933-1963), 
who reportedly filled about 90 cans of similar size with his excrement 
in 1961. ``It was made in the 1960s as a provocation to the snobbishness 
in the art world,'' museum director Finn Terman Frederiksen said in 
a telephone interview Friday, the day after the settlement was publicly 
disclosed. ``He is giving us an ironic comment on the innermost of 
the artist,'' he added. The can was borrowed four years ago for an 
exhibit on Manzoni's work. Hunov claimed it was damaged by exposure 
to strong sunlight and the museum did not take proper precautions 
during transport. Frederiksen said the leakage probably was due to 
the interaction of the can and its contents. At first, the museum 
refused to pay compensation. ``It's a very special situation where 
a piece of art has a built-in, self-dissolving mechanism,'' he told 
the Copenhagen newspaper Politiken. ``We couldn't foresee that the 
can would start leaking just as it was borrowed by us.'' The museum's 
intention is to seal the can and put it back on display, hopefully 
by next year, he said. Randers is a small museum located 210 kilometers 
(130 miles) northwest of Copenhagen.
