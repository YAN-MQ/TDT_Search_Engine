The hardest thing for Yelena Shishkina about giving birth to yet another 
child _ her 18th _ may be choosing a name. Shishkina, 42, and her 
husband Alexander already have a Sasha, Sveta, Vasya, Pasha, Anya, 
Denis, Valya, Seryozha, Olya, Lyosha, Natasha, Zhenya, Tanya, Kolya, 
Lena, Katya and Marina. Now Shishkina has given birth to No. 18 in 
a hospital in Voronezh, about 475 kilometers (300 miles) south of 
Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday. The report did 
not say whether the child was a boy or girl. Family members will vote 
on the baby's name, a procedure that could take a month, Alexander 
Shishkin warned. Russians tend to rely on just a handful of names 
and often name children after their parents or other relatives. The 
couple's oldest child is expecting a baby of her own _ bringing the 
Shishkins' flock of grandchildren to 43. The Shishkins, who live in 
suburb of Voronezh, rely on their garden to feed the family. Alexander 
Shishkin works as a driver, and the regional administration grants 
subsidies for the six school-age children. According to the Guinness 
Book of Records, the record for most children born to one woman is 
held by a Russian who had 69 children in the 1700s.
