About one fifth of Germany's forests remain diseased as in the past 
several years, a private environmental agency said Friday. Experts 
of the Agency for the Protection of German Forests, blame tree damage 
on high acidity that has seeped into the ground, while calcium, magnesium 
and other vital minerals for the trees are being washed away, an agency 
statement said. The level of damage in 1998 to the foliage of oak 
and beech trees is extraordinarily high, the agency said. In Hesse 
state, only two percent of mature beech trees and three percent of 
mature oak trees show no sign of environmental damage from pollution. 
The trend that trees over 60 years old are being harder hit by environmental 
elements is continuing, the statement said. The report said there 
were no signs indicating improvement of forest health in the near 
future. Experts say that while the situation should stagnate in 1999, 
it will do so at a high level of damage, the statement said. The Bonn-based 
agency, whose experts work in all German states to track environmental 
damage to the nation's forests, is supported by a combination of government 
grants and public donations. An official comprehensive report on environmental 
damage to Germany's forests is expected to be released by the Agriculture 
Ministry in Bonn by the end of the year.
