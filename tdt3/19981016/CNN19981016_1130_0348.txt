Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are meeting in Maryland at this 
hour, trying to reach an agreement on land transfers and security. 
President Clinton opened the talks yesterday by urging both sides 
to break a 19-month stalemate and make progress towards peace. The 
negotiators are discussing a U.S. plan in which Israel would turn 
over an additional 13% of West Bank land to the Palestinians. In return, 
the Israelis would get security guarantees from the Palestinians. 
The talks will end at sundown for the Jewish sabbath and resume tomorrow 
evening.
