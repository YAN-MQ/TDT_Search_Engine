The nobel peace prize was awarded today to two men who helped broker 
the northern Ireland peace deal. John Hume leads northern Ireland's 
major Catholic party. David trimble is a Protestant. NBC's Kevin Tibbles 
with the story. It was a proud John Hume who accepted the applause 
of Belfast school children moments after he learned he'd won the nobel 
prize. But this soldier in the battle of peace was also humbled the 
announcement. I see it not an award to myself but as a very powerful 
international approval of the peace process in northern Ireland. For 
30 years, Hume who comes from poor Catholic roots in the divided city 
of londonderry has struggled for civil rights without resorting to 
the gun. I felt that if the 0,000 British soldiers on our streets 
couldn't stop the killing on our streets, direct dialogue could, it 
was my duty to do so. It was John Hume who held meetings with Sinn 
Fein's Gerry Adams eventually bringing him into the peace process 
and bringing about a ceasefire. Hume shares the prize with David trimble 
a powerful Protestant leader. He was often confrontational. You keep 
back. But trimble was also powerful enough to drag Protestant extremists 
to the peace talks. To push the peace deal, trimble and Hume appeared 
in public together. Here at a rock concert. The deal was overwhelmingly 
accepted last may. But in hearing he'd won the peace prize, trimble 
remained cautious. I hope very much that this award doesn't turn out 
to be premature because there is still work to be done to secure peace 
in northern Ireland. Still while the peace prize has been awarded 
to a Catholic and a Protestant from northern Ireland, peace in northern 
Ireland remains fragile at best. In mid August 29 people died when 
terrorists set off a car bomb in the town of omagh. E bombers were 
opposed to the peace agreement. Many in northern Ireland are now hoping 
that John Hume and David trimble will continue to stand together and 
that today's nobel prize will be another incentive to take the gun 
out of politics in northern Ireland. Kevin Tibbles, NBC news, London.
