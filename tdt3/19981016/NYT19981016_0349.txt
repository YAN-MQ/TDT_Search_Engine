During the 40 years before his death in 1975, Dmitri Shostakovich 
was no stranger to life-and-death controversy. In 1936 Stalin attacked 
his opera ``Lady Macbeth'' as ``crude, primitive, vulgar''; the composer 
feared for his life. In 1948, an even larger attack was mounted on 
his musical style; Shostakovich lost his teaching job and again expected 
brutal knocks on the door. Now the spirit of Shostakovich is hovering 
over a Western debate that recalls that earlier era in its heat and 
vituperation. ``Moronic tract,'' one scholar asserts about another's 
work; ``borderline fraudulent'' is a return volley. ``Classic Soviet-style 
denunciation,'' declares one polemicist; ``McCarthyites,'' says another 
critic. And the point of contention? A book published 19 years ago, 
``Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich.'' From the moment 
the memoirs appeared in the West (they have yet to be published in 
Russian), they have been violently attacked and vigorously defended, 
dismissed as a forgery and hailed as a revelation. Now, with the opening 
of some Soviet archives and the accumulated testimony of those who 
knew the composer, the debate has been reopened with a vengeance, 
most dramatically with the publication of ``Shostakovich Reconsidered'' 
(Toccata Press), by an American musicologist, Allan B. Ho, and an 
emigre pianist and lawyer, Dmitry Feofanov. The two take arms against 
those who have questioned the authenticity of the memoirs, calling 
``Testimony'' _ which has now appeared in more than a dozen languages 
_ ``one of the most important and influential books in the history 
of music.'' That conclusion, however, is vehemently disputed by major 
American experts on Russian music, including Richard Taruskin, who 
has called ``Testimony'' a ``fraud'' whose acceptance was ``the greatest 
critical scandal I have ever witnessed.'' Last year this dispute broke 
out at the American Musicological Society, leading to a scheduled 
rematch at this year's meeting in Boston on Oct. 31. The starkly opposed 
positions make it clear that something bigger is at stake than whether 
Soviet musicologist Solomon Volkov really did transcribe Shostakovich's 
most private thoughts and have the chapters smuggled to the West for 
publication after the composer's death. Interpretations of Shostakovich's 
life and music are being wrestled over, along with questions about 
culture under totalitarianism and the political meanings of music. 
That is because, for much of his career, Shostakovich was thought 
to be precisely what the Soviet government said he was: a patriotic 
Communist who amply displayed his loyalty, writing paeans to Soviet 
forests and collective farms, joining the Party in 1960 and notoriously 
even signing a denunciation of Andrei Sakharov in 1973. The Western 
reception of Shostakovich was affected by that image. During the World 
War II, Shostakovich's symphonies, particularly the Fifth and the 
Seventh, were often welcomed in the West as grand nationalist anthems. 
Later, in the Cold War period, as Harold C. Schonberg put it, his 
output often seemed like ``propaganda-poster music.'' ``Testimony'' 
decisively upset this view: ``Awaiting execution is a theme that has 
tormented me all my life. The majority of my symphonies are tombstones.'' 
The book's powerfully mordant voice tells of denunciations and betrayals, 
of men soiling their pants in fear of Stalin and of multiple meanings 
coded in the compositions, which send out wrenching messages in camouflaged 
bottles. But even as Shostakovich began to be re-examined, questions 
were raised about the authenticity of ``Testimony'' and its revisionist 
view, questions that persist. Is the book really the memoirs of Shostakovich? 
Does it give an accurate portrait of his life and political position? 
And does it matter in listening or playing the music itself? Two major 
challenges were raised to the authenticity of ``Testimony.'' The first, 
as Ho and Feofanov show, was officially mounted in the Soviet Union, 
with the composer's family and colleagues asserting that Volkov never 
had more than a passing acquaintance with Shostakovich. Since then 
there have been recantations, repeated denunciations and new accounts, 
including a friend's memory of the composer mentioning his extended 
work with Volkov. But the contradictory testimony is a mine field 
of old sympathies and vendettas, so it is not likely to settle the 
debate. The other major challenge to ``Testimony,'' though, has been 
more damning. In a much-cited paper from 1980 in ``The Russian Review,'' 
a musicologist, Laurel Fay, who is now writing a biography of Shostakovich, 
proved that seven extended passages from the memoirs are taken from 
Shostakovich's published essays and appear at the beginnings of the 
book's chapters. So the book is not, as it claims, an arbitrarily 
constructed transcription of the composer's words. Her argument convinced 
important American scholars, particularly because Volkov has never 
made available either the original Russian typescript (which he says 
has been sold to a private collector) or his notes (which, he says, 
for security reasons were never saved). In a recent telephone interview, 
Ms. Fay said she remained unswayed by the latest rebuttals. Ho and 
Feofanov's argument is that none of her evidence is conclusive. Shostakovich 
was renowned for his photographic memory and would easily recite long 
passages from novels and poems; two of the passages were also published 
during the compilation of the memoirs. Volkov, in a rare interview 
in his New York apartment this month, said that though he had been 
``surprised'' by Ms. Fay's revelations, he can understand how previously 
published material came to head most of the chapters. ``When Shostakovich 
started to talk with me, he would start like a locomotive slowly, 
to warm up,'' he explained. In each session Shostakovich ``kind of 
smoothed the beginnings, when he was much more nervous than I.'' Such 
passages, Volkov guesses, might have been the excerpts, which are 
among the least significant portions of the book: ``I always started 
a chapter with the starting point of some conversation.'' These are 
important issues, but the great passions that have arisen are not 
simply about textual matters. They are about the political image of 
the composer. Critics of ``Testimony'' assert that in hailing Shostakovich 
as a secret dissident, a vulgar orthodoxy has taken shape. Supporters 
think their critics are ignorant of Soviet life and Shostakovich's 
character. The odd thing, however, is the extent of agreement. As 
Ho and Feofanov point out, the composer's critical attitudes toward 
the regime he served are now widely taken for granted, confirmed by 
the publication of some of Shostakovich's letters, along with accounts 
in Elizabeth Wilson's 1994 ``Shostakovich: A Life Remembered'' (Princeton 
University Press). So as for the broad political image of Shostakovich 
in ``Testimony,'' Ms. Fay now says: ``I don't have any problem with 
it.'' This means that the most revelatory aspect of the ``Testimony'' 
portrait may no longer be controversial. The polemical battles are 
now over qualifications and boundaries. Taruskin, for example, has 
attacked what he calls ``simplistic revisionism'' and hero worship. 
Shostakovich, he writes, should not really be thought of as a ``dissident'' 
despite his musical expressions of despair; if he ever did talk about 
his past, Taruskin suggests, he may have even distorted it, feeling 
he had ``a history of collaboration to live down.'' And Taruskin argues 
that Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth,'' itself had Stalinist characteristics 
_ an assertion that has inspired furious rebuttals. Similarly, Ms. 
Fay has argued that the composer's ``From Jewish Folk Poetry'' was 
not an act of courageous protest against Soviet anti-Semitism. Instead, 
Ms. Fay writes, Shostakovich (who was not Jewish) was just making 
a ``good-faith effort'' to answer Stalinist criticism and write accessible 
music based on folk sources; virulent anti-Semitism didn't even erupt 
until after 1948, when the composition was already completed _ and 
then it couldn't be performed. ``It was his rotten luck,'' Ms. Fay 
writes, ``that of all the available nationalities, great and small, 
he just happened to pick the wrong `folk' as his inspiration.'' That 
notion too is strenuously attacked in the Ho and Feofanov book as 
historically flawed and failing to recognize that allusions to Jewish 
music and Soviet anti-Semitism were, as asserted in ``Testimony,'' 
central themes for the composer. But what then of the music's new 
political meanings? ``Meaning in music.'' says ``Testimony'''s Shostakovich. 
``That must sound very strange for most people. Particularly in the 
West. It's here in Russia that the question is usually posed: What 
was the composer trying to say, after all, with this musical work? 
What was he trying to make clear? The questions are naive of course, 
but despite their naivete and crudity, they definitely merit being 
asked.'' And now they are _ not just about a composer's intent, but 
about the music's effects and the listener's perspective. The philosopher 
Leo Strauss suggested that literature written under persecution can 
develop a double voice, hiding an esoteric meaning under its public 
veneer. ``Testimony'' had such an impact, partly because it suggested 
that this is true of Shostakovich's music. This affects how the music 
is played, the ways phrases are shaped and stressed, even how a performance 
is structured. The violinist Rostislav Dubinsky has suggested that 
differing approaches to Shostakovich's string quartets in the Soviet 
Union arose out of differing understandings of the composer's persona. 
The doubleness can be very explicit. The composer specified political 
programs for some of his symphonies so they seemed to be glorifying 
Soviet history; many Soviet listeners though, heard other programmatic 
strains. Is the ``Leningrad'' Symphony about the Nazi siege or a horrific 
evocation of the Stalin purges? Are the massacres of the 1905 rebellion 
being invoked in the 11th symphony or the confrontations with Communist 
authority? The Fifth Symphony has come under particularly close scrutiny 
because it was billed as a response to ``just criticism'' after Stalin's 
1936 attack. Is its final movement a festive celebration (as hailed 
by the Party), or, is it an anxious, forced rejoicing (as described 
in ``Testimony'')? Ultimately, it may be both _ and more. Even Volkov 
believes it to be ``more complicated'' than the way Shostakovich presented 
to him. ``He really hated this feeling of being in this mob,'' Volkov 
said. ``But I also remember this feeling. You can hate it as you wish, 
but at some point you are swept up in this. Because it is a big power.'' 
It overwhelms, threatens, seduces and horrifies. The first listeners 
wept. And Taruskin, cautious about programmatic interpretation, is 
moved to describe the coda as ``an act of witness that gives voice 
to the wounded.'' Those varied acts of witness are being wrestled 
over in the Shostakovich wars. A generation after the death of this 
complex figure, his musical testimony continues to recall his awful 
times; now it is spurring scholarship into passions that echo, in 
their distress and anger, the moral urgency of the music.
