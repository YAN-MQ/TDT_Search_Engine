You can feel it start to burn. All through here. All you can think 
about is getting rid of it quickly. I even tried Zantac 75, but it 
didn't work fast enough. Finally, I asked my doctor. And my doctor 
said Mylanta. Fast acting Mylanta was made to work fast... where heartburn 
hurts most, soothing on contact. It's so fast. And if you suffer from 
gas, there's a Mylanta just for you: Mylanta gas.
