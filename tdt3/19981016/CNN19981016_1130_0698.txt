It's an emergency where seconds can mean the difference between life 
and death. Each year, some 50,000 Americans bleed to death from injuries 
caused by gunshots, stabbings and crashes. The American red cross 
says a new bandage may help lower that number. The bandage is made 
up of the same material used in dissolvable stitches. But the secret 
to its success is layers of a pair of proteins that cause blood to 
clot. When applied to a wound, the proteins form an invisible net 
to stop the bleeding. It can be left in because it dissolves inside 
the body, and we can control the bleeding in a matter of one to two 
minutes. The proteins have also been adapted to foam, gel, and spray 
for injuries deep inside the body. It may take awhile for these new 
blood bandages to become widespread in emergency rooms, FDA approval 
is at least a couple of years away. For the latest health news online,
