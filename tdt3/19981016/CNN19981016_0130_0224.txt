At a day-long White House conference on school violence, President 
Clinton called school safety a top priority of his administration. 
The president, his wife and members of his cabinet huddled with law 
enforcement officials, educators and students. The meeting coincided 
with the release of a report on school violence commissioned by the 
president. It found that while 16 people died in school attacks last 
year like this one in Paducah, Kentucky, the overall rate of school 
crime is declining. Nine out of ten public schools reported no violent 
crime at all. The president has also said there are no problems facing 
America that haven't been solved already somewhere in America. And 
we have seen first-hand how the enforcement of laws like zero-tolerance 
for guns in schools are combined with prevention measures like art 
classes and after-school sports and tutoring, and that together they 
help keep our children in school, off of drugs and out of trouble. 
The U.S. conference of mayors, meanwhile, says about a million students 
in grades 6 to 12 carried guns to school last year. It is calling 
for 100,000 new youth counselors to help tackle the problem.
