In a related story, President Clinton has invited Pakistani Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif to the White House later this year. Officials 
say talks with Mr. Sharif would be scheduled for early December and 
will likely involve discussion of the prospects for lifting U.S. sanctions 
against Pakistan. The White House made no mention of a similar invitation 
to India's Prime Minister Atah Bahari Vajpahi. But officials say Mr. 
Clinton would like to meet with him in Washington at some point.
