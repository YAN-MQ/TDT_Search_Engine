Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of construction 
and earth-moving equipment, said Friday that third-quarter profits 
fell 12.7 percent because of weaker sales in Asia and greater competitive 
pressures that forced the company to lower prices around the world. 
The results, which were well below Wall Street's expectations, helped 
deepen the gloom surrounding Caterpillar and other companies that 
continue to suffer from a global economic crisis that is slowing worldwide 
demand for farm and earth-moving equipment. Shares of Caterpillar, 
which is based in Peoria, Ill., fell $1, or 2.1 percent, to $47 in 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. ``It certainly looks like 
the competitive landscape has gotten worse,'' said David Bleustein, 
an analyst at Paine Webber. ``There is much more pricing pressure 
than there was three months ago.'' Caterpillar said, however, that 
revenue growth was strong, with sales of $5.17 billion in the third 
quarter, up 12.5 percent from a year ago, largely because of rising 
sales spurred by lower prices, huge discounts and strong demand for 
its equipment in the United States and Europe. Profits for the quarter 
were $336 million, down from $385 million a year ago. That translated 
into 92 cents a diluted share, down 9 percent from $1.01 a share a 
year ago. Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $1 a share. 
Slowing demand for farm and construction equipment in Asia and Latin 
America and Caterpillar's acquisition of Perkins Engines in February 
cut into profits. Caterpillar was also hurt by its foreign currency 
exposure, because of the strong dollar, and by a heavier sales mix 
of equipment that had lower profit margins.
