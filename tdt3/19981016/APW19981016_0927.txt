Three Latin American presidents and a special envoy from the United 
States will start hammering out a peace agreement this weekend to 
try to end the region's last remaining war-threatening border dispute. 
``A definite solution is now very near,'' Chilean President Eduardo 
Frei said at a press briefing here Friday. His country is one of four 
guarantor nations to a 1942 treaty that ended a war between Peru and 
Ecuador, but failed to satisfy a dispute over a short section of their 
jungle border. Presidents of three of the guarantor nations _ Brazil, 
Chile and Argentina _ expected in Oporto for Sunday's Ibero-American 
Summit _ agreed to meet Saturday, Frei said. They are expected to 
be joined by special U.S. envoy Luigi Einaudi. An Argentine diplomat 
involved in the process predicted success within days. The 57-year-old 
dispute has erupted in war between Ecuador and Peru three times, most 
recently in 1995. Tensions flared again in August when Peru accused 
300 Ecuadorian troops of entering its territory. Analysts estimate 
there are 100,000 land mines still in the area. Presidents Alberto 
Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador met with President Clinton 
in Washington earlier this month and got his promise to help find 
a solution to the dispute. They told him they had made substantial 
progress toward completing a peace agreement, but remained at odds 
over delineating the actual border area. The border region, in the 
Cordillera del Condor mountains in the highlands of the Amazon jungle, 
is potentially rich in petroleum and minerals. Hopes for a quick solution 
came Friday when legislators in Peru and Ecuador approved proposals 
from their respective presidents to accept any peace plan drawn up 
by the guarantor nations. The legislation meant that the four countries 
can impose a final solution on the two Andean nations. ``I don't see 
how it could fail now,'' said Alfredo Chiaradia, Argentine under secretary 
of Latin American Affairs, who is directly involved in the negotiations. 
``In four, five or six days we will be able to present a proposal 
that implies the signing of a peace accord,'' Chiaradia said. The 
conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war along the 
Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined. After Peru 
won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile (1,751-kilometer) 
border. But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark, 
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially 
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in 
1995 over the area.
