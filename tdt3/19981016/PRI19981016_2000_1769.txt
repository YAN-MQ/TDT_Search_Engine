...the Northern Ireland peace agreement and they've received special 
praise from President Clinton. I'd like to first say how very pleased 
I was, personally and as president, that the Nobel prize committee 
has awarded the courage and the people of Northern Ireland by giving 
the Nobel Peace Prize to John Hume and to David Trimble today. I am 
very grateful for that. Tributes were also forthcoming from British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair who said the peace process in Northern Ireland 
was an example to the world.
