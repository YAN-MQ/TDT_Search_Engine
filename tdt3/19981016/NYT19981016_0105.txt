Not so long ago, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish were swimming nowhere fast. 
The little cheese-flavored crackers were popular among preschoolers 
and the bar-stool set, but they drew scant interest from other demographic 
groups. Sales were flattish year after year. Brand managers were content 
with what they had. ``Four or five years ago, everybody loved it, 
but nobody bought it,'' said Patrick Callaghan, vice president for 
marketing at Pepperidge Farm. Then, with the installation of new top 
management in 1995, the company, a division of Campbell Soup Co., 
set out to breathe new life into Goldfish and some of its other languishing 
baked goods, like Milano cookies and Swirl bread. It poured money 
and people into better marketing, pumped-up advertising, new packaging 
and flavors and expanded distribution. The goal was to double Pepperidge 
Farm sales by the year 2000. The effort seems to be working. Sales 
have shot up for three years running at rates of 10 percent or more, 
while the rest of the cookie-and-cracker category has been anemic. 
``For a food company to grow at a double-digit rate without major 
pricing moves is relatively extraordinary,'' said John McMillin, an 
analyst for Prudential Securities. Now the question for Campbell is 
whether the smart management that revived Pepperidge Farm can bring 
similar spice to the company's flagship soup business. Pepperidge 
Farm, robust though it now is, accounted for only $825 million of 
Campbell's $7.1 billion in sales last year. Sales of soup in the United 
States, which generates half the company's revenues, have long been 
just as lackluster as Pepperidge Farm was before 1995. And while Campbell 
executives _ most of whom walk around with red and white soup-can-shaped 
lapel pins emblazoned with the word ``Growth'' _ like to point to 
Pepperidge Farm as proof that skilled management can reinvigorate 
stagnant brands, it is far from clear that the tactics that turned 
Goldfish into a gold mine can do anything for soup. ``Pepperidge Farm 
has done a terrific job,'' said Nomi Ghez, the food analyst for Goldman, 
Sachs, calling it ``a case of first-class marketing.'' But it may 
be hard to pull off the same results with soup, she added, noting 
that the category has grown just 1 percent over the last year. ``The 
big difference between cookies and soup is that soup already has very 
high household penetration,'' Ms. Ghez said. ``It's very hard to get 
people to buy more soup.'' Goldfish, in contrast, remain a small part 
of the average household's pantry inventory, with room to grow. Pepperidge 
Farm has only 5 or 6 percent of the cracker market, and 3 percent 
of the cookie market, she said. ``They're in a niche.'' Campbell chief 
executive Dale Morrison sees the company's soup potential differently. 
Morrison was president of Pepperidge Farm as the Goldfish reinvention 
got under way, and rode its success all the way to the top job at 
Campbell in late 1996. ``We are advantaged here relative to where 
we started in 1995 with Pepperidge, in terms of our scale and our 
brands,'' Morrison said. ``The advantages we have with our market 
share and the consumer connection to the Campbell brand will pay big 
dividends.'' He hopes, for example, that the familiarity will help 
convince consumers that soup can also be a snack food. Earlier this 
year the company introduced its first ``pourable,'' ready-to-eat tomato 
soup, packaged not in an opaque can but in clear plastic in hopes 
that people will see it when they swing open the refrigerator or cupboard 
doors and think, ``Maybe I'll have soup.'' The company has also come 
up with microwaveable single-serving soups and a refrigerated soup 
called Stockpot. Its latest effort, known as Away From Home, involves 
kiosks that serve soup in airports, cafeterias and other places. Campbell's 
soup business is growing in Canada, adding to the chief executive's 
belief that there is growth potential in the U.S. market. ``We're 
taking pages out of the Pepperidge Farm book and pages out of the 
Canada book as we put together the formula for our U.S. soup business,'' 
Morrison said. So far, Pepperidge Farm's premium cookie lines _ Milanos, 
Genevas, Sausalitos and their fancy siblings _ have been spared much 
competition from private-label snacks. But private-label soups have 
gained significant market share in the United States in recent years, 
much of it at Campbell's expense. ``Share gain is not the game when 
you are already the leader,'' said Jaine Mehring, a food analyst with 
Salomon Brothers, referring to Campbell's soups. ``It's more about 
staving off share erosion from private label, and dealing with a pricing 
umbrella that got a little too high.'' And other companies' innovations 
may have inadvertently helped Pepperidge Farm. The successful introduction 
by RJR Nabisco of the low-fat Snackwell's line three years ago led 
the cookie giants to battle fiercely for a consumer who eventually 
defected back to fatty cookies anyway. ``In a bizarre way, Snackwell's 
got Keebler and Nabisco to focus on low-fat products, and left Pepperidge 
Farm alone in the decadent high end of the market,'' McMillin, of 
Prudential Securities, said. ``They became viewed as the providers 
of real taste.'' Morrison, who is known to lunch on, yes, tomato soup 
with Goldfish sprinkled on top, said Pepperidge Farm was ``a little 
complacent'' when he first arrived in 1995, fresh from running the 
North American business of Pepsico's Frito-Lay unit. His plans for 
freshening the division's marketing ruffled feathers, and some of 
the executives he inherited took umbrage at the implication that they 
had been too timid about tapping into Pepperidge Farm's brand equity.
