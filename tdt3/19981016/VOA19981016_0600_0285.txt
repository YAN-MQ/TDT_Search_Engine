President Clinton has invited Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 
to the White House later this year. Officials say talks with Mr. Sharid 
will be scheduled for early December and would likely involve a discussion 
of the prospects for lifting U.S. sanctions against Pakistan. The 
United States imposed sanctions on Pakistan and neighboring India 
after their arrival of nuclear tests in May. Concerns over those tests 
prompted Mr. Clinton to cancel a trip to both countries next month.
