When we come back -- what difference does a day make on Wall Street? 
O have babies. We care about companies ..that make steel and about 
companies ..that make bread. We care about life. And about all ..that 
makes life great or possible or just better. At Cigna we care because 
it is our business ..to care. But we also care because... well, we 
have babies, too. When your allergies are a nightmare, you need help. 
Not just any help. You need the power of zyrtec. Prescription zyrtec 
starts working fast... and keeps on working for 24 hours. And zyrtec 
works against so many allergies, from cats and dogs... to pollen and 
dust. So when allergies are a nightmare-- and when are they not? Remember... 
in studies, drowsiness was the most common side effect. Others included 
fatigue and dry mouth. Most side effects were mild or moderate. Most 
people weren't bothered by them enough... to stop taking zyrtec. You 
can feel it start to burn. All through here. All you can think about 
is getting rid of it quickly. I even tried Zantac 75, but it didn't 
work fast enough. Finally, I asked my doctor. And my doctor said Mylanta. 
Fast acting Mylanta was made to work fast... where heartburn hurts 
most, soothing on contact. It's so fast. And if you suffer from gas, 
there's a Mylanta just for you: Mylanta gas.
