A 32-year-old woman who pretended to be a teen-ager to get work faces 
the possible loss of a lucrative writing contract with Touchstone 
Television. The woman, Riley Weston, posed as a 19-year-old writer 
whose skill at dealing with teen-age issues earned her a job on the 
new WB show ``Felicity'' and a three-year, $300,000 contract with 
Touchstone Television, a division of Walt Disney, to write shows dealing 
with teen-agers. Ms. Weston, who looks far younger than 32, was also 
placed on Entertainment Weekly's recent list of Hollywood's most creative 
100 people. But questions arose about Ms. Weston when the television 
show ``Entertainment Tonight'' began working on a program about the 
teen-age phenomenon. By all accounts, the television show was informed 
that it should examine her real age. Ms. Weston changed her name legally 
several years ago from Kimberlee Kramer. Imagine Television, which 
produced ``Felicity'' with Touchstone, said in a statement that Ms. 
Weston was hired as a staff writer ``based on her writing talent and 
the unique perspective we felt her age and life experience would allow 
her to bring to her creative role on the show.'' The statement said 
that the revelations about Ms. Weston were ``a complete surprise.'' 
It added, ``We trusted her as a colleague and are saddened by her 
dishonesty.'' One Imagine executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said the company felt duped by Ms. Weston's behavior. He said the 
cast and crew had a party on the set for her on Aug. 26, on what was 
believed to be her 19th birthday. ``We had this big birthday _ it's 
so insane,'' said the executive. Ms. Weston no longer works on ``Felicity,'' 
and two executives close to the show said Disney was also trying to 
end its contract with her. ``They definitely want out,'' said one 
executive. Ms. Weston was co-writer of an episode of ``Felicity'' 
that was filmed this week and she played a small role in it. A spokeswoman 
for Ms. Weston said her contract had not been renewed for the show 
before the age story broke. An Imagine executive said that Ms. Weston 
had been informed several weeks ago that her writing contract on the 
show would not be extended. The executive said Ms. Weston's last script 
was largely rewritten, and it was decided to drop her contract. ``She 
was very sweet, very nice _ she just got desperate for a gig,'' the 
executive said. Defending herself, Ms. Weston said in a statement, 
``It's been an accepted practice for actresses to lie about their 
age, especially in instances where they are always asked to play younger. 
In my desperation to find work as an actress, I adopted an age appropriate 
for my physical appearance, never imagining I would one day become 
a writer, a decision based on the scarcity of quality roles for actresses 
of my `screen age.' '' Ms. Weston said she never wanted to lie about 
her age to advance her career as a writer. ``I could not be one age 
in the acting world and another in the writing world, so I chose to 
maintain the ruse,'' she said. ``In a business fraught with age bias, 
I did what I felt I had to do to succeed.'' Ms. Weston said she regretted 
``deceiving my agents, attorneys and colleagues in what has been a 
very painful experience.'' One Imagine executive noted that in the 
``Felicity'' show filmed this week, Ms. Weston played a character 
with an unusual name. She was called Story.
