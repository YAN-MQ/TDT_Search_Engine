Trends affect the business traveler as much as the next person. Lori 
Waffenschmidt reports on just which ones are currently in vogue. The 
latest trends are some type of communication. That's really the hot 
trend. Business travelers are an interesting group. They're always 
looking at each other to try to figure out what's in and what's out. 
When a product or service catches on with savvy travelers, it may 
signal the next trend. Business travelers will try anything to make 
their life easier and more productive on the road. Topping the must-have 
list -- E-mail. Voice mail is almost kind of a thing of the past. 
Everybody is sending an E-mail. Through technology, travelers can 
integrate the physical travel and the virtual travel they do on the 
world wide web to stay connected, both to their offices and to their 
customers and clients 24 hours a day. For the hotel stay, in-room 
Internet access and refrigerators are in -- minibars are out. And 
the in-room doubles as a second home, complete with a full office. 
Features and benefits that were once considered indulgences are now 
considered essentials by the business traveler. In the air, frequent 
fliers seek ways to outsmart airline carry-on bag limits. We see, 
I think, a continuing evolution and innovation in fabrics and designs. 
That's going to allow you to pack lighter, to take all those things 
you want to take, but still get them in your carry-on bag. But to 
some travelers' dismay, comfort in coach seating seems to be out. 
They've reduced the room between seats, I think somebody told me from 
about by half. They've also narrowed the seats and crammed more and 
more people in. Not all travelers follow the crowd. I don't even have 
time to pay attention to the trends. I'm just trying to get from point 
"A" to point "B." And in the time it takes to get there, what's in 
may already be out. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN, reporting.
