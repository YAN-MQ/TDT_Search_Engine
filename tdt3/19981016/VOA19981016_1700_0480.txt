President Clinton is among those hailing the selection of two Northern 
Irish politicians for the Nobel Peace Prize. He says the Nobel Committee 
rewarded the courage of the people of Northern Ireland by recognizing 
John Hume and David Trimble for their part in the Peace Process. The 
President says many others deserve credit as well. Including U.S. 
mediator George Mitchell and the leader of the Irish Republican Armies 
political wing, Jerry Adams. Mr. Adams says he hopes the award will 
lead opponents of the Peace Accord, leashed in Belfast last April, 
to change their mind. The Nobel Peace Prize Committee Chairman, Francis 
Sergerstad says the Northern Ireland Peace Process is an example for 
the rest of the world. We do hope that, as you also said in the announcement, 
that the kind of solution they have reached, so far in this Irish 
Peace Process. And that is a process of inclusion. All parties should 
be included in the final arrangement. Peace arrangement. That this 
is a very important point to the committee. That this should serve 
us an example. Also for other countries. British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair says the award could give both sides the incentive to resolve 
remaining difficulties. He also called it a proud moment for Britain 
and Ireland. What a sense of pride people should have. That probably 
the most prestigious prize anywhere in the world has been granted 
to two symbols of community unity. Irish leader Berdia Hern agreed. 
Saying it could give both sides the confidence to move forward.
