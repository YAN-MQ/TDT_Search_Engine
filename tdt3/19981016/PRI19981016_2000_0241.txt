American and Japanese officials have met in Tokyo to discuss the case 
of a U.S. Marine accused of causing the death of a teenager in Okinawa. 
The Marine is accused of driving while impaired. Both sides are anxious 
to avoid calls for removal of American servicemen from Okinawa, as 
happened three years ago.
