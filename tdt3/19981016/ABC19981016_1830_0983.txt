Something powerful is happening. Introducing the new Silverado. With 
a more powerful V-8 than any other pickup. It's the truck. From Chevrolet. 
Like a rock oh, like a rock I can't afford to have rough hands. Not 
with my patients. Oh, yes, you are. I try to keep my hands smooth 
so that it will be comforting when I touch the patient. It's a great 
thing that this hospital uses keri. Keri's therapeutic formula works 
on three levels. First, it soothes. Then, it moisturizes. Finally, 
it protects against dryness. The babies love it when my hands are 
soft because then my skinis as so as theirs. Keri. It's trusted therapy 
for dry skin. And there's keri anti-bacterial hand lotion to kill 
germs as it softens hands.
