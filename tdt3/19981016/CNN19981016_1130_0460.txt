A change in the diet of killer whales poses a threat to the ecology 
off the coast off western Alaska. The whales are eating sea otters, 
which has brought on a population boom for sea urchins normally kept 
in check by the otters. The sea urchins are stripping the undersea 
kelp forests the whales turned to sea otters about 10 years ago when 
the population of their normal food -- sea lions -- declined sharply.
