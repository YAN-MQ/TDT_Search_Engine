Game one of the world series is set to go tomorrow night in New York, 
with the Yankees hosting the padres. The ceremonial first pitch will 
be thrown by the cubs' Sammy Sosa. The pitching matchup features Kevin 
brown against David Wells. To have an opportunity to win another world 
series, I mean, it's something to go after. Because, I mean, you don't 
have these chances all the time. And to be part of this organization 
and have done what we've done this year and not win a world series, 
you know, it'd be frustrating.
