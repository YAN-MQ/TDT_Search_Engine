When the American cultural historian Ann Douglas was deep into the 
13th century for her doctoral dissertation at Harvard, she discovered 
what she calls predecessors of the modern media: the handmade books 
created by Roman Catholic priests in England and France to record 
the religious visions of illiterate peasants. As Ms. Douglas tells 
it, the peasants described their visions, and the priests compiled 
them in books used to promote their orders. ``It was that fundamental 
process,'' Ms. Douglas said, ``by which the private becomes public.'' 
Since then Ms. Douglas has continually rediscovered how often that 
process occurs. In a body of work that covers almost a century and 
a half of American history, Ms. Douglas has seen again and again how 
the private has become public. To her, Kenneth Starr's investigation 
into President Clinton's sex life is just the latest example. Indeed, 
in her view (sharpened by a book in progress about Cold War culture 
in the United States), Starr has picked up where Sen. Joseph McCarthy 
left off. The criminalization of sexual behavior was born in the 1950s, 
she said, ``when you had senators saying that basically homosexuality 
was an indicator that someone was a communist.'' The Starr investigation 
reflects nothing less than ``the victory of Cold War aims revamped 
for the 21st century.'' ``I feel some sort of horrified sense of being 
caught in a re-enactment,'' Ms. Douglas said. ``Think how happy he 
would be to be in Ken Starr's spot,'' she added. (Ms. Douglas describes 
herself as a ``Democrat on the left.'') ``He didn't dream of anything 
quite like this. And he absolutely knew that Americans loved to see 
facts and documents. He would have totally understood the 36 boxes. 
The visuals are very, very similar here. Of course there are differences, 
but boy, are there a lot of parallels.'' Ms. Douglas, 56, is a professor 
of English and comparative literature at Columbia University. She 
talked the other day in her Riverside Drive apartment not only about 
Clinton, Starr and the Cold War, but also about her struggle with 
alcoholism, her religion, the 8,000 books in her apartment and her 
upper-class New Jersey childhood in which ``Protestant theology survived 
only as a belief in caste, polite manners and conventional behavior.'' 
She rarely came up for air during the discussion and was simultaneously 
dizzying, exhausting and riveting. Sometimes she wandered off on entire 
expeditions away from the main point and made intellectual leaps from 
Hannah Arendt to Marilyn Monroe to the ``horrifying'' stiletto heels 
and stiff hair of the 1950s American woman, who looked, she said, 
like ``a miniature defense industry.'' A former student, Patrick Horrigan, 
likens Ms. Douglas' classroom style to performance art. David Damrosch, 
the chairman of Columbia's English department, remembers that a student 
once told him that Ms. Douglas' teaching style was so magnetic that 
it seemed as if ``we're all going to heaven together.'' Ms. Douglas' 
first book, ``The Feminization of American Culture,'' published in 
1977, argues that the Victorian era gave birth to the first products 
of modern mass culture _ the romance novels and women's magazines 
catering to the middle-class American matriarch _ and that advances 
in printing made their distribution far more widespread. ``Terrible 
Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920s,'' her second book, is a kind 
of sequel showing how black and white artists revolted against the 
sentimentality of earlier eras and saw their ideas more rapidly disseminated 
in movies, radio and the tabloid press. In her Cold War book, ``If 
You Live You Burn: Cold War Culture in the United States: 1939-1965,'' 
Ms. Douglas will argue that the advent of television fed McCarthyism. 
The most sensational scandals and trials of 20th-century America, 
Ms. Douglas said, have occurred in the three decades _ the '20s, '50s 
and '90s _ that saw the creation of new media: radio, television and 
the Internet. She pointed to the Scopes and Leopold and Loeb trials 
of the 1920s, the Alger Hiss and Rosenberg trials of the 1950s and 
now Starr. ``There's this whole medical theory that when surgeons 
develop new tools,'' Ms. Douglas said, ``they overuse operations that 
will test them. When mankind has new tools, he will think up the events 
and the situations in which it can use them.'' Ms. Douglas is best 
known for ``Terrible Honesty,'' which took 15 years to write and which 
she said was delayed at least five years by her alcoholism. (Ms. Douglas 
stopped drinking in 1988; ``Terrible Honesty'' was published in 1995.) 
``I had to redo so much of the work I'd done,'' Ms. Douglas said. 
She was haunted by the people in the book _ F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dorothy 
Parker, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway _ whose drinking shadowed 
their lives. ``I got in a cul-de-sac of not being able to see the 
characters whole anymore because I was so caught up in the most negative 
parts of their lives,'' she said. ``It wasn't that I was trying to 
be like them, it was more that I was afraid that `How can it be that 
I have all these people's problems without their genius?' It was more 
this growing sense of horror that my whole life, a much less life, 
was going to be consumed.'' Ms. Douglas attempted suicide twice, recovered 
and kept drinking. Her turning point came on a beautiful autumn day 
a decade ago when she was sitting in her living room, overlooking 
the Hudson, and thinking, ``Very soon I'm going to be dead.'' But 
then ``this thought'' came into her mind, telling her not to surrender. 
``Basically, I would call it my soul,'' she said. ``I certainly hadn't 
heard from it for a while. Within 24 hours I was on the phone to hospitals 
looking for treatment.'' Her Cold War book has ``a whole new batch'' 
of drinkers for her to deal with: ``Charlie Parker! Bud Powell! Jack 
Kerouac! William Burroughs!'' She laughed ruefully but said she could 
handle them now. Her colleagues agree. ``The last few years have been 
an extraordinary process of flowering for Ann,'' Damrosch said. ``It 
was like a floodgate opened. She's just everywhere now; she's constantly 
writing. There's a real electricity in the air when she's around.'' 
Ms. Douglas was married for a decade, divorced, then was involved 
for 12 years with Jay Fellows, a professor at Cooper Union and an 
alcoholic, who died of alcohol poisoning in 1990. She lives alone, 
has no children and finds strength in what she calls the spiritualism 
that came into her life after she stopped drinking. (She was raised 
in the Dutch Reformed Church but now calls herself generically a Christian.) 
Although Ms. Douglas does not go to services, she says prayers in 
the evening and reads a small part of the Bible each morning. ``It 
seems to work for me,'' she said. She has decided that her recovery 
was not from her efforts alone: ``I believe that something intervened 
in my life, and I choose to call that God. I really don't know any 
other way to describe it.'' Although Ms. Douglas described herself 
as a public alcoholic _ ``in my world, everybody knew I was an alcoholic'' 
_ she nonetheless said she could not imagine having every aspect of 
her past open for debate on the Internet. ``There's so much to be 
embarrassed about _ take your pick,'' she said. With Starr's dissemination 
of the details of the president's sex life, Ms. Douglas said, ``It 
amazes me that people aren't thinking, `This could be me.''' On a 
less somber note, Ms. Douglas said she was also irritated that the 
four-hour broadcast of the president's grand jury testimony cut into 
``All My Children,'' which she has watched regularly for 22 years. 
It started when Ms. Douglas began watching the show with a friend 
who was having a nervous breakdown. The friend was staying with her, 
and her doctor had recommended a soap opera as part of her therapy. 
``She recovered, went back to work, and I've been watching it ever 
since,'' Ms. Douglas said cheerfully. ``I love narrative, and soap 
is pure narrative. Meaning it will go on and on as long as life. And 
it is, I think, kind of therapeutic.''
