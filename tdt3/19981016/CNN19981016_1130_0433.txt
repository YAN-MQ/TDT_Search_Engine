An enormous iceberg -- bigger than Delaware -- has broken off an ice 
shelf in Antarctica. The national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
says it's 92 miles long and 30 miles wide. It covers an area of 2,700 
miles. The last time an iceberg this size broke off Antarctica was 
11 years ago. Scientists say it could be a sign of global warming.
