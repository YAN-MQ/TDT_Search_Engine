Time to check the weather. First of all there's hurricane Lester threatening 
the southwestern coast of Mexico. A lot of moisture from that trailing 
into the central portion of the country. Along with that vigorous 
cold front producing some thunderstorms, even some tornadoes in parts 
of the dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas. 's been snowing over the central 
and northern Rockies and through Wyoming, parts of Utah, even. Temperatures 
chilly there. 44 right now at Salt Lake City. Much colder in the mountains. 
20's across the intermountain gion. 60's as far forth as rockford, 
Illinois. Tomorrow's high temperatures, the coolest air across the 
northwest and the northern plains with highs in the 40's. 60's and 
70's even in the northeast. A great day for game one of the world 
series, our Yankees and the San Diego padres. Temperatures around 
the 60's at gametime. Thunderstorms across the northern plains which 
will start to shift east as we go into Sunday hand Monday. The thunderstorms 
will move out of the plains into the Great Lakes. Warm temperatures 
continue across the southern states. Another area of low pressure 
will bring showers to the great basin. If you've got an extra ticket 
to game I'd like to go. I wish I did. Janice, thanks.
