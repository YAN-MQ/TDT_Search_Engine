I'm Pat Bodner, VOA NEWS. NATO ambassadors have extended by ten days, 
Saturday's deadline for Yugoslavia to withdraw forces from Kosovo 
Province, or face alliance air strikes. VOA's Ron Penstein reports 
from NATO headquarters in Brussels. NATO is maintaining its order. 
Authorizing air strikes against Yugoslavia. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea 
says Yugoslavia's still not fully complied with the agreement to remove 
its army from Kosovo. We are still at some distance from full compliance. 
There is clear evidence that many army and special units that are 
normally based outside Kosovo are still deployed in Kosovo. The order 
to launch air strikes was supposed to go into effect on Saturday morning. 
The NATO council has now delayed that order until October 27. NATO 
officials say Yugoslavia's begun removing two military units from 
Kosovo. And the Alliance believes nine more days are needed to complete 
the process. Ron Penstein, VOA NEWS, Brussels.
