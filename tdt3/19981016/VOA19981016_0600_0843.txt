An Australian court has charged 18 foreigners with narcotic trafficking. 
Seven Hong Kong Chinese nationals and eleven Indonesians were remanded 
in custody at a Sidney court today. The men were arrested Wednesday, 
after Australian police and customs officers intercepted 440 kilograms 
of heroin that was being transferred from a ship to an isolated beach, 
north of Sydney.
