In Sweden today, the nobel peace prize was awarded to two men who 
are still trying to achieve a lasting peace in northern Ireland. John 
Hume, a Catholic, and David trimble, a Protestant, will share the 
prize and the money that goes with it. They are, in so many respects, 
unlikely partners for anything. Here's ABC's Jim Wooten. It must have 
been difficult. The Norwegian nobel committee -- As perplexing as 
northern Ireland itself. Easy to award it to a nonviolent Catholic, 
Mr. Hume. Not so easy to name a militant Protestant, Mr. trimble. 
But just too difficult to choose Gerry Adams, an integral part of 
the settlement, but an awkward choice for the prize because of his 
long association with IRA terrorists. He was not included. Trimble, 
in Denver today, was cautious. I hope very much that this award doesn't 
turn out to be premature, because there is still work to be done to 
secure peace in northern Ireland. Hume was not so much exultant as 
hopeful. The prize, he said -- Strengthens our peace process enormously 
because it tells all the people what the world wants to see in our 
streets. Trimble marched in those streets with Protestant hard-liners, 
while Hume was caught between British troops, Protestant paramilitaries 
and Catholic bombers -- until eventually he brought them all into 
negotiations. In New York today, Adams said the nobel was not the 
big prize. The big prize is the peace settlement, and that's the prize 
for us all to keep our eye on. And that's the prize which is worth 
achieving. He did congratulate human, his fellow Catholic but Adams 
pointedly would not speak the name of David trimble. Even on this 
day of cheer, old animosities were there. Jim Wooten, ABC News, London.
