President Clinton has welcomed the award of the Nobel Peace Prize 
to Northern Ireland's lead negotiators: John Hume and David Trimble. 
But he says many others deserve credit for the Ireland Peace Accord, 
included earlier this year. VOA's David Gullis reports from the White 
House. Mr. Clinton, whose administration was heavily involved in helping 
broker the Good Friday Accord. Said he was pleased that the Nobel 
Committee had rewarded the courage of the people in Northern Ireland 
by giving the Peace Prize to John Hume and David Trimble. But speaking 
at a budget event in the White House rose garden, the President said, 
many others should share in the honor. Both have earned this award. 
But I believe there are others, too, who deserve credit. For their 
indepensible roles. Beginning with Jerry Adams, the leader without 
whom there would have been no peace. Mr. Clinton also mentioned Irish 
Prime Minister Bertia Hern ; his British counterpart Tony Blair; British 
Minister for Northern Ireland, Moe Moland ; Moderate Catholic politician, 
Seamus Malin ; and former Senator George Mitchell, the U.S. mediator 
in the peace talks. David Gullis, VOA NEWS, the White House.
