All right. Thanks a lot, Susan. Game one of Major League Baseball's 
1998 World Series, gets underway Saturday evening at at New York's 
Yankee Stadium. Between two teams that have never met before in post-season 
play: the New York Yankees, and the San Diego Padres. VOA's Martin 
Bush reports. With 121 victories in season and post-season play, the 
New York Yankees are favored in this year's World Series. But, in 
a best four of seven game match-up, that may mean little. In Series 
play, it's often the hot team, or the team with a few hot players 
that wins. In game one, both teams call on their ace pitchers. Right-hander 
Kevin Brown for the San Diego Padres. Left-hander David Wells for 
the Yankees. Both 18 game winners. Hard-hitting Tony Gwynn is the 
lone Padres player to play on San Diego's only pennant winning team 
in 1984. Well, the Yankees want to win, and we want to win too. I 
hope we have the same kind of Series we had here in Atlanta. Where 
two teams were scrapping, trying to do whatever they could do to try 
to win. Because that's what it's all about. Both teams have top-grade 
closing relievers. Which could be a factor in wining the World Series. 
Trevor Hoffman for the Padres, Mariano Rivera for the Yankees. Martin 
Bush, VOA NEWS, New York.
