Good evening. We are going to begin tonight in casper, Wyoming. Wyoming 
is sometimes called the lonesome land. Casper's one of the few places 
of any real size. Doesn't very often make the news. But in casper 
today, they buried young Matthew shepard, the gay University student 
who was beaten and left to die outside the town last week. Two men 
are charged with his murder. ABC's Lisa Salters is there. The dreary 
weather fit the mood at the church in casper where Matthew shepard's 
family and friends came to say good in peace. Today is for Matthew. 
TePJID T pvate ceremony was only for those who knew him best. Most 
merciful God, whose wisdom is beyond our understanding, deal graciously 
with Matthew's friends and family in their grief. Earlier in the day, 
shepard's parents spoke publicly for the first time about his murder. 
Matthew was the type of person that, if this had happened to another 
person, would have been the first on the scene to offer his help, 
his hope and his heart to the family. They describedo didn't deserve 
to be left alone last week, to die alone on a wooden fence. Because 
Matt's last few minutes of consciousness on earth may have been hell, 
his family and friends want more than ever to say their farewells 
to him in a peaceful, dignified and loving manner. But protesters 
of shepard's lifestyle came anyway. They gathered across the street 
from today's service. And they remembered him differently. He lived 
in shame, he died in shame. It's not okay to be gay. It's not okay 
to be gay. It's a soul damning, nation-destroying lifestyle. The protests 
didn't go unanswered. If you guys don't recognize him as a human being, 
you don't need to be out here! The shepards chose to ignore all that. 
Instead, they gave thanks today to the thousands of well-wishers around 
the world, who, they say, have comforted them in their time of sorrow.
