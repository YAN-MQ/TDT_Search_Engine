Lesotho's government on Friday rejected an opposition plea to release 
30 rebel soldiers from arrest, saying they must face mutiny charges. 
The dispute shook confidence in a long-sought agreement reached this 
week that to settle nearly three months of upheaval in this tiny mountain 
kingdom surrounded by South Africa. ``This is a legal process, therefore 
the government cannot intervene as it wants the law to take its course,'' 
said Deputy Prime Minister Kelebone Maope, who met with the opposition 
alliance in Maseru. The soldiers arrested Thursday could be charged 
with treason for overthrowing the military leadership in September. 
The charge carries the death penalty. Opposition leaders repeated 
charges that the arrests represented a betrayal of the agreement. 
They said the 30 were among 1,500 rebel soldiers who had returned 
to their bases earlier this week under assurances that nothing would 
happen to them. ``This unwarranted somersaulting by the government 
is the surest way of planting the seeds of destruction in the midst 
of this very young and delicate process towards the establishment 
of peace, stability and ... reconciliation,'' said Vincent Malebo, 
an opposition leader. On Wednesday, government and opposition parties 
agreed to set up a special body to prepare for new elections. The 
group was to create the basis for free and fair elections within 18 
months and help normalize the security situation. Party tensions have 
been running high since the May elections, which opposition groups 
claim were rigged. After the army revolt and crippling strikes, South 
Africa and nearby Botswana on Sept. 22 sent about 1,000 troops into 
the country to restore calm. South Africa expected to establish order 
quickly and leave, but scores were killed and its soldiers remain 
in Lesotho. To restore damage from the upheavals, international economic 
delegations have been consulting with the government. They include 
the U.N. Development Program, the International Monetary Fund and 
the Southern African Development Community.
