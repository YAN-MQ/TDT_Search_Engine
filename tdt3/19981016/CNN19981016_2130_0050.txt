Good evening. President Clinton is happy about his victories in the 
1999 federal budget but is disappointed some things were left out 
including a patients Bill of rights. A vote was supposed to take today, 
but has been delayed. Another spending resolution has been approved. 
Yesterday, republicans and democrats agreed on the measure. President 
Clinton says it came at a price. We can be justifiably proud of the 
hard work and hard-won gains that this budget represents. Of the 100,000 
teachers, of the after-school programs, of saving the surplus for 
social security. Of protecting the environment and advancing the cause 
of clean water and a safer global environment. Of keeping our economy 
going strong. But eight days of progress cannot replace or make up 
for eight months of partisanship. This budget includes about $1 billion 
for a national missile defense program.
