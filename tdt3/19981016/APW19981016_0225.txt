percent in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 5.4 percent 
in the same period a year ago, the government said Friday. The total 
number of unemployed people dropped to 271,000, a sharp decline from 
372,000 in the same period in 1997, according to the Dutch Central 
Bureau for Statistics. Adjusted for seasonal influences, the third-quarter 
jobless rate fell to 3.9 percent, down from 5.4 percent a year earlier 
and down from 4.1 percent in the previous three months ended August. 
The total number of unemployed reached an adjusted 270,000 in the 
latest reporting period, down from 370,000 in the same period a year 
ago and from 279,000 in the period ended August. The CBS pointed out 
that this rate of unemployment decline has continued in the past two 
years.
