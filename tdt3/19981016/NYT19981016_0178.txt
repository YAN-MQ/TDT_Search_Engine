NATIONAL FORECAST Isolated severe thunderstorms produced hail and 
damaging winds in parts of western Minnesota and the Dakotas on Thursday 
as low pressure lifted unseasonably warm air over the region. Saturday, 
showers and thunderstorms will erupt from Wisconsin to Texas as the 
low and its attendant cold front push slowly eastward. Some of the 
thunderstorms will be quite strong, especially over the Upper Midwest, 
where a vigorous jet stream disturbance enhances rapidly rising air 
currents. Behind the front, a chilly, soaking rain will occur from 
northern Minnesota to the eastern Dakotas. Near the western edge of 
this band of steady rain, snow will fall in the Black Hills of South 
Dakota and in the higher terrain of eastern Wyoming. Meanwhile, sprawling 
high pressure over Virginia will provide sunshine and warm temperatures 
to much of the Eastern states. High temperatures will be 10 to 15 
degrees above normal in parts of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The 
exception to the sunshine and warmth will be in parts of New England, 
where high clouds will dim the sunshine at times. Tranquil conditions 
will also prevail in much of the West. Offshore winds near the California 
coast will drive low clouds out to sea, insuring ample sunshine. Elsewhere, 
a weak storm system will enter the Pacific Northwest, with clouds 
and scattered rain showers west of the Cascades. The valleys of eastern 
Washington and Oregon will be mainly dry with partial sunshine. Focus: 
Recurving Typhoon After lashing Luzon, the Philippines, Typhoon Zeb 
has recurved to the northeast over the past two days. Forecasters 
in the United States always take note of a recurving typhoon in the 
western Pacific because a forecasting rule maintains that colder air 
typically arrives in the Northeast states five to seven days later. 
The rule is fairly reliable, based on the idea that warm air associated 
with the typhoon helps to build a ridge of high pressure over the 
eastern Pacific, which, in turn, allows Canadian air to slide into 
the Northeast. Computer forecasts indicate an invasion of Canadian 
air by next Wednesday.
