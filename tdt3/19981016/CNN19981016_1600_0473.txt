Typhoon zeb roared across Taiwan today and is bearing down on the 
southern islands of Japan. Torrential rains triggered floods that 
have caused extensive damage in Taiwan. At least six people have died. 
Most schools are closed and air travel has been disrupted. Zeb claimed 
at least 74 lives when it hit the Philippines earlier this week. The 
casualty figure is expected to rise.
