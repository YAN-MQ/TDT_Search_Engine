Top-seed Pete Sampras took a mere 57 minutes to overpower unseeded 
Tim Henman 6-0, 6-3 Friday and advance at ease into the semifinals 
of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament. The American, 
who attends the Vienna competition for the first time, was the clear 
favorite to win the title. ``You never know how you're gonna play,'' 
Sampras said after his win, but ``my game just clicked today. I couldn't 
have played any better.'' Sampras lauded Henman despite his clear 
defeat. ``Tim represents the next generation of players,'' he said. 
``He will be a consistent top player as long as he wants to.'' Henman 
joked afterward saying, ``I played great _ the first point.'' ``But 
I cannot complain really, because you are going to have a bad match 
from time to time. I've had like 21 or 22 good matches in a row.'' 
Sampras, an eleven-time Grand Slam winner, even compared his performance 
with that in Hanover last year when he became ATP World Champion. 
But he added, ``Tomorrow things may look quite different'' when he 
meets fellow-American Todd Martin, who ousted Cedric Pioline 6-4, 
6-3 in another quarterfinal clash. Later, hopes for a final pitting 
Sampras against second-seed Patrick Rafter of Australia vanished when 
Britain's Greg Rusedski downed Rafter in 76 minutes 6-3, 7-6 (7-3). 
In semifinal play Saturday, Rusedski faces 24-year-old Slovak Karol 
Kucera, who eliminated unseeded Jonas Bjoerkman of Sweden 6-3, 6-2. 
Rusedski, who on Thursday subdued local darling Thomas Muster in two 
straight sets, took revenge for the defeat he suffered at the hands 
of Rafter in the U.S. Open final in 1997. In head-to-head count, Rusedski 
still trails Rafter 2-5. It was his second victory over a top-ten 
player after his first-round win against Yevgeni Kafelnikov of Russia. 
``That's a great victory for me. To beat Patrick here was definitely 
a step forward,'' comented a visibly elated Rusedski. By his victory 
over Bjoerkman, Kucera made a major stride toward first-time qualification 
for the ATP World Championship in Hanover. Early this week, in an 
intermediate ranking, Kucera was in eighth spot. Kucera has steadily 
risen in ATP rankings since former top player Miloslav Mecir took 
care of the young Slovak hopeful. ``I like to work with him, he was 
always one of my idols, like (Ivan) Lendl or (Stefan) Edberg.''
