will produce some thunderstorms especially across the upper midwest, 
but behind the system we could see some lingering snow mixed with 
rain over the northern plains. The snow should be easing over the 
rocky mountains after a foot or so has fallen. In the northwest, a 
few showers will occur along a cold front, with snow in the mountains, 
but the eastern part of the country will see beautiful warm weather

50s from the northern plains into the northwest. Looking ahead to 
Sunday, snow possible the northern Great Lakes with showers and storms 
into Texas and highs just in the 40s and 50s in the northern plains.
