He CNBC's Ron Insana with us tonight who will host a MSNBC special 
report called "surviving the money crunch" which will air Sunday morning 
at 10:00 eastern time. A lot more to tell you about as we continue 
this Friday evening. The sadness in cha has become the national interest 
in a horrifying crime in Wyoming where one chapter came to a slow 
end today. And tonight part two of our special report from "dateline 
NBC" -- who pays when the paper or cardboard you're traveling on ask 
red hot, stolen? Have you ever made a long- distance call that was 
so short, you wish you didn't haveo pay for it? Hi, it's jodi... and 
this is Bill! And nobody's home! You got that right. Just sign up 
now, and calls you make that are less than 30 seconds are free. So 
if you make a quick call, get an answering machine or a wrong number, 
at least you won't have to pay for it. Hey, don't say a word. I just 
called to tell you... "I love you." I'm deeply touched. Jane? Of course, 
the reason you call long distance is to talk, so when your call lasts 
longer than 30 seconds, it's just a dime a minute... plus you'll get 
short calls free. Hey, mom. I use a cup full of this laundry stuff, 
right? Oh, a cap-full. I gotta go. Put time on your side. Get a dime 
anytime and short calls free.
