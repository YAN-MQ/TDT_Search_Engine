The Green Bay Packers wanted to erase a painful National Football 
League loss to the Minnesota Vikings as they travel to Michigan to 
play the Detroit Lions. But the Packers came up short Thursday 27-20. 
Quarterback Brett Favre piled up three hundred yards in passing along 
with two touchdown strikes to Antonio Freeman but Favre's turnover 
problems continued as he also threw three costly interceptions. Detroit 
rookie quarterback Charlie Batch had a great game, completing sixteen 
of nineteen passes for two hundred eighteen yards and two touchdown 
strikes. The win gives Detroit a 2 and 4 record pulling even with 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the National Conference Central Division. 
The Packers dropped to 4 and 2, second to the undefeated Minnesota 
Vikings.
