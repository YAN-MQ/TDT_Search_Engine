But there is talk of the situation in Kosovo. NATO ambassadors in 
Brussels have given Yugoslav President Slobodom Mulosovich ten more 
days to pull back forces from Kosovo Province. The U.S. says Mr. Mulosovich 
has not yet met U.N. demands to withdraw troops. And will face air 
strikes if the new deadline is not met. VOA's Gil Butler has the details. 
State Department Spokesman James Rubin talking to reporters covering 
Middle East talks on the eastern shore of Maryland, says there has 
been substantial, but not sufficient compliance by Yugoslav President 
Slobodom Mulosovich on the agreement worked out by U.S. Envoy Richard 
Hallbrook. Mr. Mulosovich was to remove police and military units. 
And allow international monitoring and surveillance over flights to 
assure compliance. Mr. Rubin says about half the Serb forces that 
had been in the field in Kosovo are no longer there. And, there are 
signs that displaced Kosovar Albanians are returning home. But he 
said NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, must still hold out the 
threat of military action to assure Serb compliance. In his words, 
NATO's gun should remain cocked. What we're talking about is continuing 
to provide Gen. Clark the authority to use force, by a later date 
now, to extend the time frame if there is not compliance by President 
Mulosovich. On the compliance question, it is our view that there 
is not yet full compliance. And that is why we believe very strongly, 
that NATO's military commander must remain in a position to have all 
the authority to act in the coming days. The first of a force of two 
thousand international verifiers to check on Serb compliance may arrive 
shortly in Kosovo. Gil Butler, VOA News, the eastern shore of Maryland.
