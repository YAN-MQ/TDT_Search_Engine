An estimated 20,000 poles crowded into St. Peter's square today to 
celebrate Pope John Paul II's 20th anniversary as leader of the Catholic 
church. The Pontiff conducted a mass this morning and said it was 
difficult to speak without becoming emotional. John Paul was elevated 
to the papacy in October of 1978 at the age of 58. He was the first 
nonitalian to lead the Roman Catholic church in 455 years.
