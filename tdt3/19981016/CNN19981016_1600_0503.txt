trough moves through. High temperatures will be in the 80s across 
most of the virgin islands, with a chance of afternoon thunderstorms. 
Honolulu today will see a high of 86, while Barrow sees a chance of 
wind and a high temperature of 31 degrees. Temperatures will be in 
the 40s and 50s for the western U.S. look for a Ridge to keep temperatures
