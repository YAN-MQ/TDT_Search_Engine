Japan's upper house of parliament has given final approval to a package 
of laws to clean up Japan's ailing banking sector. The new laws will 
set up a $520 billion dollar fund of taxpayer dollars to bail out 
weak but solvent banks. Earlier, parliament passed a supplemental 
budget to fund the reforms. Japan has been under intense international 
pressure to reform the banking sector that has been crippled by a 
series of speculative bad loans made during the 1980's.
