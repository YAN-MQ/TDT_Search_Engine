FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ NRG Energy, a Minnesota-based power company, 
has announced plans to open a brown coal power plant in the eastern 
state of Saxony Anhalt, a newspaper said Friday. David Peterson, head 
of NRG planning, was quoted in an interview with the daily Mitteldeutsche 
Zeitung as saying the new company will create 100 to 125 jobs. Using 
2.5 million tons (2.8 standard U.S. tons), of lignite per year, the 
new company will also ensure an estimated 100 jobs at Mitteldeutsche 
Braunkohlegesellschaft mining company in Theiszen, the report said. 
Construction of the new power plant is to begin in mid-2000 at an 
estimated cost of 800 million marks (dlrs 500 million). Power production 
will begin in mid-2003, with an estimated capacity of 400 megawatts, 
the report said. NRG's home base is Minneapolis.
