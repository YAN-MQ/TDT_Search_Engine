A surgical procedure developed in France might help as many as one 
in five people with Parkinson's Disease. The shaking palsy that afflicts 
many of the elderly. At the Fifth International Congress of Parkinson's 
Disease and Movement Disorders in New York, University of Granoba 
Researchers described subthalmic nucleus stimulation or STN. This 
procedure involves inserting electrodes deep into the brain regions 
involved in movement and posture. The electrodes are hooked by wire 
to a pacemaker device worn on the chest. The high frequency electrical 
signals block out Parkinson tremors. Lavadopa, the standard drug treatment 
for Parkinson's, often becomes less effective after five to 10 years. 
The researchers say that those patients are likely to benefit most 
from STN. University of Granoba team has treated 78 patients with 
the electrical stimulation procedure since 1993. They report that 
20 percent of those treated no longer take Lavadopa. As for the rest, 
their Lavadopa intake has been significantly reduced. A benefit given 
the medication's side effects.
