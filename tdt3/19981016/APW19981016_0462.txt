A High Court on Friday indicted 100 members of Republic of Congo's 
former government with a sweeping list of offenses including assassinations, 
tortures, rapes, fraud and theft. The list of charges were read by 
the nation's public prosecutor Placide Eleka at a press conference 
in the capital Brazzaville. Among those indicted were the country's 
ousted former president Pascal Lissouba, ex-Brazzaville mayor and 
prime minister Bernard Kolelas and former finance minister Ngila Moungounga. 
All are currently in exile. President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who captured 
the reigns of power from Lissouba during a bloody five-month civil 
war last year, has repeatedly accused his predecessor of genocide 
during the war in which about 10,000 people were killed. The civil 
war broke out in June after Lissouba tried to disarm Sassou-Nguesso's 
private militia, the Cobras, before July presidential elections that 
both men planned to contest. The war ended when Angolan troops and 
tanks entered the fighting, backing the Cobras, who celebrated their 
victory with a looting spree lasting several days. A national forum 
appointed by the government earlier this year has named a 75-member 
National Transition Council to help govern the country during its 
transition to civilian rule instead of a parliament. President Denis 
Sassou-Nguesso who returned to power after a bloody five month long 
war last year, has repeatedly accused Lissouba and his associates 
of genocide during the war in which 10,000 people were killed. The 
civil war broke out in June after Lissouba tried to disarm Sassou-Nguesso's 
private militia, the Cobras, before July presidential elections that 
both men planned to contest. The war ended five months later after 
Angolan troops and tanks entered the fighting, backing the Cobras, 
who celebrated their victory with a days-long looting spree. Sassou-Nguesso 
earlier ruled a one-party Marxist state from 1979-91, then lost to 
Lissouba in presidential elections in 1992. Lissouba visited the United 
States last month to rally support for a resolution to declare he 
had been illegally ousted in a coup _ a step towards pushing for possible 
sanctions and foreign aid cuts to Republic of Congo.
