Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two minute break. But, we'll be back shortly. This is VOA NEWS Now. 
We're coming up on 22 hours, Universal time. And that it means, as 
always, that we're saying goodnight to most of our listeners in the 
Middle East and in North Africa. We thank you for being with us, and 
tune in again tomorrow beginning at 4 hours, Universal time. When 
VOA NEWS NOW resumes on 7.17, 11.965, and 15.205 MHz short wave. If 
you are listening in the Persian Gulf area right now, we invite you 
to stay with us, for another couple of hours on medium wave at 1548 
KHz. And if you are listening in the Eastern Mediterranean, we'll 
be back on the air with VOA NEWS NOW, 30 minutes from now, on 1260 
KHz medium wave. Here's the frequency change if you're listening in 
Africa. We are now going off 15.41, 15.445, 15.58, and 17.725 MHz 
short wave. We invite you to retune to 7.34 MHz, or any of our other 
remaining frequencies. Well, listeners in Europe, we are now going 
off WRN1 Via Astra.
