Football Championship, Saturday. When they take on the Golden Gophers 
of Minnesota, in Columbus. The Buckeyes are undefeated this season. 
While the Gophers have three wins and two losses. OSU defensive coordinator 
Fred Podges says his team can't get fitted for the National Championship 
rings, just yet. We have a great bunch of young men that have great, 
great work ethic. And are very focused. And I hope that they continue 
to improve weekly, and play hard every week. Meanwhile, number two 
UCLA hosts Pack 10 Conference rival, Oregon. While number 3 Kansas 
State has a Big 12 battle with Oklahoma State. K State coach Bill 
Snyder says his team has to be prepared for a tough battle with the

hard. Very physical football team. We undoubtedly have our hands full. 
during the course of this season so far. The fifth ranked Florida 
Gators take on SEC rival, Auburn. While number seven Florida State 
battles Klempson. Also, Saturday, Nebraska takes on Kansas. And Penn 
State hosts Purdue.
