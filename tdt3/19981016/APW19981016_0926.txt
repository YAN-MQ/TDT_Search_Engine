Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura will spend the weekend working 
toward a World War II peace treaty with Russia, which the two countries 
have never signed. President Boris Yeltsin has promised that a treaty 
will be signed by 2000, although it hinges on solving a dispute over 
the Kuril Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war 
off Russia's Pacific coast. There have been no signs of progress on 
resolving the disagreement, despite an overall improvement in relations. 
In an interview published Friday, Komura said Russian-Japanese relations 
have made progress because of summits between Russia's President Boris 
Yeltsin and Japan's former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. ``In 
Russian-Japanese relations ... there has been a continuous dialogue 
on a high level,'' Komura told the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Komura, 
who arrived in Moscow on Friday night, is expected to meet Russian 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and 
other top officials, the Interfax news agency reported. The visit 
comes one day after Russia's parliament voted to reinstate a holiday 
marking the defeat of Japan in World War II. The holiday had been 
dropped after the 1991 Soviet collapse. The upper chamber of parliament, 
the Federation Council, agreed to reestablish the Day of Victory Over 
Militarist Japan, which marks the Soviet Union's defeat of Japan on 
Sept. 3, 1945, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The measure, which 
has already been approved by the lower house, requires President Boris 
Yeltsin's signature to become law. A liberal Russian lawmaker, meanwhile, 
said Thursday it would be ``impossible'' to pass an agreement on the 
Kurils through the current parliament. ``Therefore this subject should 
not be brought into Russia's internal political debate before the 
next parliamentary election,'' said Vladimir Averchev, a member of 
the Yabloko party and the State Duma's international affairs committee, 
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
