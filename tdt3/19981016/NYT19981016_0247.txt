On the morning he won the Nobel Peace Prize, John Hume got out of 
bed, as usual at 8:30, made himself some cereal and bananas for breakfast 
and prepared to spend another day in his life's work: trying to permanently 
end sectarian violence in this predominantly Protestant British province. 
But before the news of the prize came, Hume, the most prominent mainstream 
Roman Catholic leader in the province, could not help wondering about 
the award, he said in an interview here Friday afternoon. Two years 
ago he had also been nominated, but the only Nobel prize given to 
an Irishman went to the poet Seamus Heaney, who went to school with 
Hume 50 years ago. ``They told me I would get a phone call from the 
prize committee if I won,'' he said Friday. But when his time came, 
``I never got the phone call,'' he said. Instead, a Norwegian journalist 
phoned him from Oslo and said there were reports that he had won. 
His wife, Pat, turned on the radio at about 10 a.m. in the living 
room of their house in Londonderry, west of Belfast. ``You got it, 
John!'' shouted his wife, who has also been his chief assistant for 
the 30 years of his relentless campaign for a peaceful settlement 
involving the Protestant majority, the Catholic minority and the British 
army and police. ``I don't know what I thought when I heard,'' he 
said. ``I was very pleased, of course. But I see it as a very powerful 
statement that has given international endorsement for the peace process.'' 
Then, he straightened his gold and black patterned necktie and went 
to work, talking peace to groups in Londonderry and Belfast, acknowledging 
without a smile that he was pleased with the award. In public, he 
used the same old calm, logical words he has used thousands of times, 
telling an audience of Catholic and Protestant schoolgirls in Belfast 
that, ``We'll spill our sweat together, not our blood. Your generation 
must lay the foundation for a new society. Did you choose to be born 
Catholic or Protestant? So why fight with someone from the other community.'' 
And he quoted the words of warning his unemployed father gave to him 
as a boy in persuading him to shun the violence of the overwhelmingly 
Catholic Irish Republican Army: ``You can't eat a flag.'' He posed 
with the girls, opening his too-tight suit jacket and revealing that 
he has grown heavier in recent months. His sometimes unkempt black 
hair was neatly combed. Some of the girls tittered and squeaked and 
asked for his autograph. Being treated like a celebrity was an unfamiliar 
role. The paternal advice led Hume, a French teacher in the 1960s, 
to become a champion of a peaceful settlement. In Washington he urged 
the government not to listen to highly vocal IRA supporters in the 
United States. But during a day of fielding hundreds of questions, 
he refused, when asked, to say the prize was a validation of his life's 
work. However, most ordinary people here, government officials including 
President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, and experts 
agree that without Hume's effort there would be no peace agreement. 
The pact, approved in the spring, drastically reshapes political power 
in the province, giving Catholics more power and giving the overwhelmingly 
Catholic Irish Republic more influence in northern affairs. But the 
Nobel Prize also underscored the fact that Hume, 61, and suffering 
from a nerve disorder, is getting ready to distance himself from the 
wearying peace effort _ thousands of debates, seemingly endless contentious 
issues, deals within deals, careful political statements designed 
to keep the two sides talking, not shooting and bombing. His gradual 
withdrawal from the effort began in June when he allowed Seamus Mallow, 
a colleague in the mainstream Catholic Social Democratic Labor Party, 
to become the Catholic leader in the new Northern Ireland Assembly 
with the title deputy first minister. The first minister, Protestant 
unionist leader David Trimble, who was in the United States, shared 
Friday's award with Hume. Friday afternoon, at the Dominican College 
here, a girl said Hume seemed to be drifting away from Northern Ireland 
after all his years as a peace advocate. No, he said, he would continue 
to work for the province in London where he is a member of Parliament 
and in Strasbourg where he has a seat in the European Parliament, 
as well as in Washington. But he acknowledged that he had stepped 
back in the new Assembly, where much hard work remains, because ``I 
couldn't take on the extra work.'' When a reporter for French television 
asked what he would do with his share of the $960,000 prize money, 
he said in lightly accented, fluent French, ``Ce n'est pas pour moi, 
mais pour le peuple. Un prix symbolique.'' (``It is not for me, but 
for the people. A symbolic prize.'') As to the money, he smiled broadly 
and said he would be able to use it ``tres bien.'' (``Very well.'')
