BONN, Germany (AP) _ NATO must keep up pressure on Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to make him comply with this week's peace deal 
for Kosovo, Germany's outgoing foreign minister said Friday. Klaus 
Kinkel's warning was aimed in part at Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, 
a Social Democrat whose future government includes the Greens, a party 
with a significant pacifist wing. ``Milosevic only reacts to military 
pressure,'' Kinkel said in a speech to parliament. ``One must not 
send the wrong signal to Belgrade through disunity and half-hearted 
measures.'' The outgoing parliament later Friday was expected to approve 
German participation in any NATO military action against Milosevic. 
With Schroeder's agreement, the outgoing Cabinet on Monday approved 
sending 14 German jet fighters for any NATO attack aimed at forcing 
Milosevic to withdraw weapons from Kosovo province. That decision 
also requires parliamentary approval, but the newly elected legislature 
is not to convene until Oct. 26. So a special session of the outgoing 
parliament was called. Karsten Voigt, the Social Democrats' foreign 
policy spokesman, wholeheartedly backed German participation in the 
NATO military threat against Milosevic despite the agreement easing 
the threat of airstrikes. ``Any other policy would have isolated Germany 
in the alliance and in Europe, and it would have rewarded those who 
use violence,'' he told the meeting. In committee meetings Thursday, 
lawmakers from both Schroeder's Social Democrats and outgoing Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition supported the decision. Several 
Greens lawmakers abstained, arguing that NATO action without an explicit 
U.N. mandate would violate international law. But others said they 
would support Greens party leader Joschka Fischer in backing NATO 
action. Schroeder is expected to name Fischer as his foreign minister. 
Despite an agreement this week easing the threat of air strikes against 
Yugoslavia, Kohl's defense minister, Volker Ruehe, said the vote was 
still needed. ``The sword must remain visible,'' he said.
