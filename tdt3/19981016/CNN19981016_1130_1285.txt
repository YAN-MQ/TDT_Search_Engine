Mike Sammond, "Headline Sports." While one Yankee is coming out of 
the hospital, another remains in. Yankee outfielder Darryl Strawberry 
is scheduled to be released from a New York hospital today, a week 
after undergoing surgery for colon cancer. Meanwhile, former Yankee 
great Joe DiMaggio remains in a Florida hospital, suffering from pneumonia. 
The hall of famer will turn 84 next month.
