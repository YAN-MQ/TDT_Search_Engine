In a decade when frantic and information-sodden people must rely on 
handy aids like ``Wittgenstein in 90 Minutes'' and ``Dating for Dummies,'' 
can't someone do the same for the pope, who at the age of 78 keeps 
producing long and idea-packed encyclicals? ``Wojtyla in 90 Minutes''? 
``John Paul II for Dummies''? If such an abbreviated treatment existed, 
here are three observations it might include on the remarkable document, 
``Fides et Ratio'' (``Faith and Reason''), that John Paul II has issued 
on the 20th anniversary of his pontificate. First, the tone of ``Fides 
et Ratio'' is positive and embracing. The pope is resolute, not surprisingly, 
in his affirmations of the truths of faith but measured in his criticisms. 
Even when worrying about contemporary nihilism, the document has none 
of the apocalyptic pitch this pope occasionally reaches (``the culture 
of death''); nor does it scold. His appraisals of major trends in 
current thought are sharp but almost always accompanied by appreciative 
acknowledgments of their strengths and insights. Second, ``Fides et 
Ratio'' is an extraordinary vote of confidence in the human mind and 
the capacity of human reason to reach objective truth and real knowledge. 
Be bold, is the pope's exhortation to philosophers, and by extension 
to thinking people generally. (``Every man and woman is in some sense 
a philosopher.'') Take on ``the fundamental questions which pervade 
human life,'' he urges, questions that arise from both the wonder 
of existence and the challenge of suffering and death. There is an 
obvious irony in the fact that the Catholic papacy, once viewed as 
the leading enemy of the inquiring mind, is now urging philosophers 
to overcome their ``false modesty'' and go where they fear to tread. 
Philosophy should recover its ``sapiential dimension'' and its ``metaphysical 
range'' _ its concern for the practical wisdom that people can live 
by and its stretch for a truth that, however imperfect and inevitably 
analogical, goes beyond ``the factual and the empirical.'' John Paul 
II is aware that this appeal will appear ``daunting'' to many contemporary 
thinkers, and he recognizes that their resistance to such ambitions 
arises in part from the bleak experience of a bloody age and from 
a fear that any strong claims to truth ultimately encourage intolerance. 
He tries to turn this argument around: it is the moral vacuum created 
by human reason's abandonment of its search for fundamental truths, 
he maintains, that breeds totalitarianism; and it is the belief in 
the possibility of a universally valid truth that provides ``the essential 
condition'' for authentic dialogue between people of different viewpoints. 
Third, ``Fides et Ratio'' spells out a complex and subtle notion of 
the mutual relationships between faith and reason. They are neither 
opposed nor identical, nor simply added one upon the other. Roman 
Catholicism has long been critical of stances that make faith a dramatic 
departure or ``leap'' from what is rational. And while the pope insists 
on the centrality of Revelation for faith, he also insists that philosophy 
must proceed by its own rigorous methods and not simply rubber-stamp 
the beliefs of faith. In John Paul II's account, faith and reason 
are interwoven throughout the process of searching for truth. Simply 
to comprehend the language and credibility of Revelation is to employ, 
implicitly or explicitly, the tools of reason. And Revelation, the 
pope states, opens up questions and possible answers for reason that 
it would not otherwise recognize. This has a practical consequence 
for the Roman Catholic Church _ and maybe for other bodies of believers, 
too. The division of labor between theology and philosophy can never 
be neat. Philosophy, therefore, has to be an important part of theological 
education. That was, of course, the case for Catholicism before the 
Second Vatican Council. Not only was theology highly philosophical, 
relying as much on reasoning in the deductive mode as on Scripture 
or religious experience, but so was the ethos of Catholicism generally. 
Catholic thinkers defined terms, made distinctions, constructed syllogisms 
and wielded proofs and analogies with such vigor that critics within 
the church as well as outside complained that church leaders operated 
under the illusion that people could be argued into faith. In the 
last three decades there has been a sharp swing in the other direction. 
Not only have biblical studies been given a new emphasis _ a change 
no one has challenged _ but philosophical training for priests have 
often become a patchwork of views, and theologians and spiritual writers 
have eschewed the rigors of reasoning that had before been almost 
reflexive. The pope is clearly calling for a course correction. It 
seems hardly likely that he wants a return to the kind of textbook 
Thomism that characterized seminary training in an earlier era. While 
he hails the accomplishments of St. Thomas Aquinas, he also declares 
that the church has no official philosophy and he clearly welcomes 
a wide range of philosophical approaches. Like other papal documents, 
``Fides et Ratio'' may be seized upon by various factions struggling 
for leverage in the church. Liberals may be quick to point out that 
unlike some other recent encyclicals and the English translation of 
the Catechism of the Catholic Church, this one is written in gender-neutral 
language. They may chuckle at the fact that two of the modern Catholic 
philosophers the pope praises by name, John Henry Newman and Antonio 
Rosmini, had to endure Vatican suspicion and attack in their lifetimes. 
Conservatives, on the other hand, may be quick to note that some of 
the past papal documents that John Paul II cites _ although not the 
particular passages _ were highly denunciatory of the liberalism of 
their time. Such partisanship would be a disservice to the encyclical. 
It is by no means a complete argument. It is a map, not a journey 
_ a proposal for future directions in human thought that should stimulate 
considered responses from believers and nonbelievers of all sorts.
