was discharged from the hospital today where he was recovering from 
colon cancer surgery. Doctor are optimistic that Strawberry will make 
a complete recovery and play baseball next season. I am so pleased 
and delighted with the fact that, you know, the cancer has been removed 
from me and I can move forward. The New York Mets reportedly will 
make catcher Mike Piazza the highest paid player in baseball. "The 
New York post" is reporting in today's edition that next week the 
team will offer him $91 million over seven years. Insiders say there's 
a good chance he will turn down the deal and test the free agent waters.
