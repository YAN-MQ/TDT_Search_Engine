Tucked into the $1.7 trillion budget agreement is a new measure that 
would restrict children's access to pornography on the Internet. The 
measure was sponsored by Republicans who said they had written it 
to overcome free-speech objections that the Supreme Court used to 
overturn a previous measure. But even before Congress passes the new 
budget, the same groups that defeated the last effort are vowing to 
sue once again. The old act tried to regulate access by children to 
``indecent'' or ``patently offensive'' pornographic material. Last 
year, the Supreme Court ruled that an unconstitutional violation of 
the First Amendment. The new version, called the Child Online Privacy 
Act, changes the standard, saying that Internet merchants and others 
will be in violation only if they give children access to material 
that is ``harmful to minors.'' (Internet service providers are exempt 
from liability if they do not produce the offending material). Peggy 
Peterson, spokeswoman for Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, who is a primary 
sponsor of the proposal, said her office had established that the 
new language was backed by numerous court decisions providing a clear 
and rigorous standard for violation. The new act, Oxley said in a 
floor statement early this month, ``employs the constitutionally tested 
harmful-to-minors standard recognized and upheld in federal courts 
for more than 30 years.'' In a general sense, that standard refers 
to material that is specifically created for prurient interests, that 
graphically depicts lewd or sexual behavior, and that holds no social, 
artistic or scientific value. But Ann Beeson, a lawyer for the American 
Civil Liberties Union, which led the last court fight, said ``this 
one has the same flaws as the last one,'' the Communications Decency 
Act of 1996. ``We will definitely sue.'' Ms. Beeson said, adding that 
the ACLUand a dozen allied groups would file their suit some time 
next week. ``Under this law,'' she said, ``I think even The New York 
Times would be in violation, by posting the Starr report on its Web 
site.'' Ms. Peterson called that ``bogus,'' and added that ``the Starr 
report does not even approach the harmful-to-minors standard.'' The 
Clinton administration opposes inclusion of the proposal in the budget 
act, but allowed it to slip past on the assumption that the courts 
would overturn it, an administration official said. The Justice Department 
sent a letter to Congress this week, saying the department believed 
that the new proposal would run afoul of the same First Amendment 
concerns that ensnared the the Communications Decency Act. Ms. Beeson 
said the ACLU suit would be joined by ``a diverse range of online 
speakers representing news organizations, gay and lesbian groups, 
artists, booksellers and online video dealers,'' among others, including 
any Web sites that distributed the Starr report. Just like the Communications 
Decency Act, she added, ``this bill will once again criminalize socially 
valuable adult speech and reduce the Internet to what is considered 
suitable for a 6-year-old.'' Electronic Frontier Foundation president 
Barry Steinhardt plans to join the suit and said: ``It is the height 
of irony that the same Congress that plastered the salacious Starr 
report all over the Internet now passes a plainly unconstitutional 
law to suppress a vaguely defined category of `harmful' material. 
You would think Congress would have learned that `harmfulness' is 
in the eye of the beholder.'' New York Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen 
said The Times and other major news organizations had been asked to 
join in the last suit and declined. ``We haven't followed the new 
one closely,'' she added, ``but we're looking at it.'' Ms. Peterson 
said the bill would require Internet pornographers to positively verify 
that a visitor to a site was an adult. One means of verification would 
be to require a credit card for a site that charges for access. ``That's 
already being done,'' she said. Another means might be the use of 
digital signatures. In the meantime, Oxley noted, ``much of the Internet 
is awash in smut.'' ``There are literally thousands of Web sites dedicated 
to every manner of perversion and brutality,'' he said. ``A child 
may innocently search for key words like `doll house,' `toys' or `pets' 
and be led to numerous explicit sites.'' In fact, using the phrase 
``doll house'' in an Internet search engine brings up 19 entries on 
the first screen, including sites on doll house collections, doll 
house furniture _ as well as doll house escort services and the ``doll 
house strip joint.'' Clicking on any of the latter sites brings up 
pornographic images that are used to entice visitors to join.
