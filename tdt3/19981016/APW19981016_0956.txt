More than 1,000 Iranians staged a noisy demonstration Friday against 
British author Salman Rushdie, vowing to kill him and the publishers 
of his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' The protesters cheered as the 
organizers unveiled a three-story portrait of an alleged would-be 
assassin of Rushdie that was painted on an apartment building in a 
northern suburb of Tehran. The crowd carried banners reading ``There 
is no turning-back from Imam Khomeini's fatwa'' in clear opposition 
to the government's decision last month to distance itself from the 
death sentence imposed on Rushdie by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
The ayatollah, the leader of the Islamic Revolution of 1979, condemned 
the Booker Prize-winning author to death on the grounds that his book 
blasphemed Islam. The Iranian government said last month that it did 
not support the bounty offered for the death of Rushdie and, after 
a meeting between their foreign ministers on Sept. 24, Britain and 
Iran decided to upgrade their relations to ambassadorial level. The 
move has been fiercely attacked by hard-liners in Iran who oppose 
the policies of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami. A semi-government 
organization raised the bounty to more than dlrs 2.8 million and Friday's 
demonstration was the second this week by supporters of the fatwa. 
``Our government must know that if they don't want to participate 
in carrying out the orders of Imam Khomeini, that's fine. But if they 
want to interfere with his edict, then we are facing serious problems,'' 
the protest leader, Allah Karam, told the crowd through loudspeakers. 
Demonstrators shouted ``Rushdie must die.'' A man in a wheel-chair 
took the podium to deliver a message in English to Rushdie: ``Listen 
to me. Remember my face. I'm your killer. I want to have a dialogue 
with you - with a machine gun. We will kill you.'' The organizers 
introduced another man, his face covered by a black and white checkered 
scarf that revealed only his eyes, as the person who would try to 
carry out the death sentence. The 25 by 10 meter (82 by 33 feet) mural 
showed Ayatollah Khomeini and Mustapha Mazeh, who died in 1989 in 
a London hotel while working on a homemade bomb. British police, who 
guard Rushdie closely, have dismissed reports that Mazeh, a French 
citizen of Moroccan origin, planned to kill Rushdie, but in Iran he 
is believed to have targeted the author. The demonstrators also vowed 
to kill the staff of Viking-Penguin, which originally published ``The 
Satanic Verses.'' The company has had its premises bombed in several 
countries. Most of the demonstrators had earlier Friday taken part 
in the funeral procession for three Iranian diplomats slain in Afghanistan. 
More than 10,000 people atttended the funeral of the diplomats who 
were slain by Taliban militiamen in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif 
in August. Their bodies were returned on Oct. 11. The bodies of the 
other five diplomats and a journalist killed during the Aug. 8 attack 
on the Iranian consulate were buried in Iran last month. The Taliban's 
return of the bodies is seen as an attempt to improve relations with 
Iran, which has massed more than 200,000 troops on its border with 
Afghanistan. The Taliban, which now controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
do not have diplomatic relations with Iran and accuse the country 
of supporting their opposition.
