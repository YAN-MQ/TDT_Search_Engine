And what about the real test of the economy -- the confidence out 
there on the main streets across America, in the small towns and large 
cities? Tonight, NBC's Jim Avila on the low-grade anxieties out there. 
Armitage street, a north side Chicago shopping district that raced 
through economic boom of the 90's, today has its foot poised over 
the brake pedal. Caution's yellow light, flashing. My mutual funds 
are losing money like mad. In fact, Mary popma is not alone. Since 
the market dropped 1250 points in August, personal welt has plummeted. 
Americas are $2.1 trillion poor and feeling it. Popma sells antiques. 
In a good year Christmas sales make up 20% of her income, and she 
is nervous. If my Christmas season is off this year, I won't have 
the extra money to do anything with, I'll have to be careful. Down 
the street, Debra Brady sells clothes. But since the market fell this 
summer, not nearly as many as she used to. It makes me a little nervous. 
I've cut back on some of the merchandise that would still be coming 
in closer to Christmas. It's that way nationwide. It's not just stock 
prices falling. The national restaurant association says sales are 
down, so are luxury car sales. And the travel industry says Americans 
are planning fewer trips. Consumer confidence is at a low for the 
year and has dropped five months in a row. University of Chicago economist 
Robert aliber says big-ticket purchases will be the first to go. They'll 
keep the car one more year, rather than trade-in the car this year. 
They'll postpone making the addition to their home. Alan Kahn has 
a good job, a comfortable home in a nice Chicago suburb and a son 
in college. He's canceled plans to build a new garage. A garage is 
a major investment, and it's something one can live without. Furniture 
manufacturers are developing recession plans because of forecasts 
of record slow growth. I would consider buying fabric rather than 
the leather because of the economy. On the map it is a long way from 
Wall Street to armitage street, but when it comes to money, middle 
America is finding out just how how close they really are. Jim Avila, 
NBC news, Chicago.
