Social Security benefits will rise 1.3 percent next year, the government 
announced Friday. That would be the smallest cost-of-living increase 
since 1987. More than 44 million Americans receive such benefits. 
Most are elderly, but about 30 percent are under the age of 65. The 
increase is small because inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price 
Index, has been exceptionally low. The Commissioner of Social Security, 
Kenneth Apfel, said the average monthly Social Security check for 
retired workers would rise next year by $10, to $780. For an elderly 
couple, both receiving benefits, the average check will rise by $17, 
to $1,310. Benefits in a number of other programs are also tied to 
the Consumer Price Index. The maximum monthly payment for 6.6 million 
low-income individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income will 
rise to $500, from $494. In a separate announcement, the Department 
of Health and Human Services said that the monthly Medicare premium 
would rise next year to $45.50. For the last two years, it has been 
fixed at $43.80. Medicare premiums are deducted from monthly Social 
Security checks. The premiums are recalculated each year to reflect 
changes in health care costs and Medicare law. The spending habits 
of retirees obviously differ from those of younger people. But Henry 
Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said there was no 
conclusive evidence that living costs were rising much faster for 
the elderly than for other Americans. Some research using experimental 
price indexes for the elderly suggests that the inflation rate for 
older consumers may be slightly higher than the overall rate, but 
the difference appears to be very small. In any event, many Social 
Security recipients are under 65. Of the more than 44 million people 
who receive Social Security, 27.3 million are retirees, 3.4 million 
are dependents of retired workers and 7.4 million are survivors of 
workers who have died. In addition, 4.6 million disabled workers and 
1.6 million of their dependents get Social Security. The American 
Association of Retired Persons pointed out that medical costs were 
rising faster than most consumer prices, and that elderly people, 
on the average, spend 19 percent of their income on health care and 
health insurance. Thus, the association said, Congress should be wary 
of proposals to reduce the cost-of-living adjustment as part of any 
program to revamp and preserve Social Security. Martin Corry, director 
of federal affairs at the association, said: ``For the vast majority 
of Social Security beneficiaries, the cost-of-living adjustment is 
the only source of retirement income that is indexed for inflation. 
Changes in the cost-of-living adjustment and the Consumer Price Index 
should be last on the list of possible options for savings in Social 
Security. Such changes have a disproportionate effect on low- and 
moderate-income people, and on the oldest of the old.'' The indexing 
of federal benefit programs has been criticized on the ground that 
it tends to increase federal spending. But the Congressional Research 
Service said the 1972 law that authorized automatic increases in Social 
Security, linked to the Consumer Price Index, was sought mainly by 
conservatives, ``as a means of curbing even larger ad hoc benefit 
increases'' approved by Congress in prior years. Many economists have 
said that the Consumer Price Index overstates the cost of living. 
The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics is making changes in the index 
in an effort to fix that problem.
