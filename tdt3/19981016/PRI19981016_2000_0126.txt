NATO ambassadors have given Yugoslav President Milosevic another 10 
days to comply with U.N. resolutions on Kosovo. A previous deadline 
was due to expire early tomorrow. But BBC's defense correspondent 
Jonathan Marcus has the details. NATO insists that its aim is to keep 
up the military pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia 
to withdraw army and special police units from Kosovo. Effort are 
underway to establish both a civilian monitoring operation on the 
ground and a NATO-run monitoring effort from the air. With the framework 
for at least an interim settlement in place, it was unlikely that 
NATO would resort to military action. The alliance is still talking 
tough. But there's a danger that his message may appear rather ambiguous, 
not the least to Mr. Milosevic in Belgrade. Jonathan Marcus reporting.
