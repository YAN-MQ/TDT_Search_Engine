Shortly before sunup in Denver Friday, one of the new Nobel Peace 
Prize winners, David Trimble, held an impromptu news conference outside 
the Brown Palace Hotel as he hurried to meetings with business leaders 
on the final day of a trade mission here. Trimble told a few reporters 
that the award was a great honor, and one that he hoped foretold a 
true peace. ``I'm quite sure that we've crossed a watershed this year, 
and I don't think there'll be any going back,'' said Trimble, 54. 
``There's still some difficulties on the road, some obstacles to negotiate, 
but I think we will manage to do that and this award may help that.'' 
Trimble was asleep at 3 a.m. when the awards were announced, and members 
of his staff fielded calls from around the world until they woke him 
with the news two hours later. He was greeted by the glare of local 
TV news camera lights and microphones as he left his hotel. Although 
he was given a standing ovation at his scheduled breakfast meeting 
with about 100 business and civic leaders, the leader of the Ulster 
Unionist Party, the main Protestant party, steered talk back to the 
business at hand. ``Thank you, thank you, but we've got some business 
to do,'' he told the crowd. Trimble is a member of a delegation touring 
11 U.S. cities in three weeks in an effort to interest companies to 
do business in Northern Ireland. The real prize will be lasting peace 
for his country and prosperity to go with it, he told reporters. ``The 
honor is for all those who worked so hard in the peace process, and 
the honor is for the people of Northern Ireland who endorsed that 
process and who have longed for peace for so long,'' he said. As for 
sharing the honor with John Hume, leader of the Catholic Social Democratic 
and Labor Party, Trimble said he thought it was ``appropriate.'' ``I 
feel quite happy to share the award with John,'' he said with a laugh. 
``I think by honoring both our parties the committee has been very 
wise.''
