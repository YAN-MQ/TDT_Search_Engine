Pope John Paul is celebrating an anniversary. An estimated 20,000 
poles made the trip to St. Peter's square today to help commemorate 
the 20th anniversary of his elevation to the papacy. During morning 
mass, the Pontiff said it was difficult to speak without getting emotional. 
The native of Poland was 58 when he became Pope. He was the first 
non-Italian to lead the Catholic church in 455 years.
