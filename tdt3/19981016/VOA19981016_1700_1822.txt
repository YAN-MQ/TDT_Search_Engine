First, a summary of world news. I'm Dave DeForest, VOA NEWS. NATO 
ambassadors have extended by 10 days, Saturday's deadline for Yugoslavia 
to withdraw forces from Kosovo Province Or face Alliance Air strikes. 
The vote in Brussels came as NATO officials confirmed that Yugoslavia 
has begun removing some of its forces. But is still some distance 
from full compliance. A spokesman warned of air strikes if troops 
remain. Diplomats in Belgrade have approved deployment of two thousand 
unarmed observers in Yugoslavia's Kosovo Province to insure withdrawal 
of Serbian troops and special police. And to help displaced persons, 
mostly Ethnic Albanians. And help them to return home. VOA correspondent 
Art Chimes reports from the Yugoslav capitol. Under an agreement hammered 
out by U.S. Envoy Richard Hallbrook, the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe will provide inspectors on the ground, to 
verify Yugoslavia's compliance with the U.N. demands. The current 
head of the OSCE, Polish Foreign Minister Benjosof Garamet, Friday, 
signed the agreement for the verification mission with Yugoslavia's 
foreign minister. Mr. Garamet said that withdrawal of forces from 
Kosovo is not itself the goal. The first purpose of this mission is 
stop the bloodshed. And also, to avoid a humanitarian disaster in 
Zurich. In addition to the unarmed observers on the ground, NATO spy 
planes will fly overhead for additional verification that Yugoslav 
troops are pulling out of Kosovo. Art Chimes, VOA NEWS, Belgrade.
