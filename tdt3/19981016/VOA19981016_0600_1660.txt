Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a 2 minute break. This is VOA News Now. This is Friday, October 16th. 
On this date in 1940, the United States announced an embargo on all 
scrap iron and steel shipments to Japan. The ban was a result of growing 
American concern about the Japanese military expansion in Asia and 
especially reports of barbarous behavior by Japanese troops in China. 
The top U.S. embargo and other joint economic measures with England 
and the Netherlands, including the halt to oil systems began to threaten 
Japan's war industries and that nations' economic expansion. The cabinet 
in Tokyo considered two men responses to the embargo's either abandon 
ambition for empire or conquer the countries in Asia with the necessary 
raw materials are bonded. Japan chose the second course. That nation's 
continuing ambitions was to World War II. On October 16th 1859, the 
anti-slavery crusader, John Brown, led an attack on the federal government's 
armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. Mr. Brown believed that God had 
chosen him to lead a holy war to free black slaves in the United States. 
Mr. Brown's assault on the armory at Harpers Ferry was intended to 
capture arms and ammunition and to spark a slaves into direction of 
the surrounding Virginia country side. Brown, who had led bloody anti-slavery 
raids in the Kansas territory held at Harpers Ferry armory for two 
days. However, there was no slave uprising and the expected help from 
black recruits never came. What did arrive was a force of federal 
troops commanded by future Confederate General Robert E. Lee that 
drove Brown and his followers from their strong hold. It's 10 hours
