From baseball to the tennis courts. World number one men's player 
Pete Sampras easily reached the semi-finals of the CA Trophy Tennis 
Tournament in Vienna, Austria, Friday. The 27 year old American crushed 
Tim Hennman of Britain in straight sets: six-love, six-three. Sampras 
will next take on compatriot Todd Martin, a straight-sets winner over 
Frenchman Cedric Pioline. Fifth seat Carol Cuhero of Slovakia defeated 
Jonas Yorkman of Sweden, to book a place in the Final Four. He faces 
Greg Rusisky of Britain, an upset winner over U.S. Open champion Patrick 
Rafter of six-three, seven-six.
