The Japanese parliament today approved legislation to prop up ailing 
banking systems with public funds. That should help ease the credit 
crunch on Japanese companies. The BBC's Juliette Hendall reports from 
Tokyo. The bill will permit the government to inject public money 
from a fund expected to be worth about $500 billion into banks which 
are short of capital that are otherwise healthy. To qualify for help, 
banks will have to meet a set of stringent conditions. They'll have 
to agree to absorb another failed or failing bank. They'll be required 
to give a very detailed assessment of their outstanding loans before 
they can receive funds. The banking legislation is seen as crucial 
to Japan's recovery, but there are still many other pressing issues 
to deal with before the country returns to economic health. Juliette 
Hendall reporting from Tokyo.
