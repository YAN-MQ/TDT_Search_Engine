BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO on Friday extended the deadline for 
Yugoslavia to come into compliance with terms of a peace deal on Kosovo, 
giving President Slobodan Milosevic until Oct. 27 to honor the agreement. 
NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the force of about 400 
warplanes ready for possible airstrikes, despite the Kosovo deal struck 
this week with Serb authorities. ``We are still at some distance from 
full compliance,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium, 
adding the alliance had ``clear evidence'' that an unacceptable number 
of Serb troops and police remained in the province. The extension 
of Saturday's deadline was expected to be granted, giving both the 
Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light of this week's 
steps toward compliance. Earlier Friday, Western and Yugoslav officials 
signed a second pact in two days to make sure the Yugoslav president 
pulls his forces out of the strife-torn province. The accord allows 
2,000 unarmed monitors for the 54-nation Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe to roam Kosovo and verify whether Milosevic 
keeps his word to end the crackdown. ``This is only the first step'' 
toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish 
foreign minister, said after signing the agreement with Yugoslav Foreign 
Minister Zivadin Jovanic. Geremek said so far he had received promises 
from member countries for about 800 volunteers, although he did not 
say how long it would take to train, equip and station the monitors 
in Kosovo. Meanwhile, NATO spy planes will begin flying over Kosovo 
shortly under an agreement signed late Thursday by NATO's supreme 
allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and Yugoslav Army 
Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic. The U2 spy planes may begin flying 
over Kosovo as early as this weekend. Jetfighters could patrol the 
skies nearby in case the spy planes are threatened, NATO sources said 
in Brussels, Belgium, on condition of anonymity. That will help NATO 
determine Milosevic's compliance even before the monitors start their 
work on the ground. Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw remaining 
Serb forces from Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians 
toward self-rule in the southern Serbian province, and allow up to 
300,000 refugees to return to their homes. Geremek said, 12th graf
