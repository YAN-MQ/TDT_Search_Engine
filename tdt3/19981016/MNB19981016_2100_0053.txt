First this evening, the story that is turning ugly as lawsuits often 
do, especially when once private details start emerge toward the end, 
especially when the subject is the president and the object is money. 
That is the case in the Jones case. Playing out, nearing an end slowly 
though in Arkansas. Adding to the paralysis that has stricken the 
White House already. Begin with the latest from Lisa Myers. Renewed 
hope of a settlement in the Paula Jones case comes as a new lawyer 
steps in to stop feuding among all of Jones' other lawyers, three 
sets of lawyers. The settlement now being discussed challs for President 
Clinton to pay Jones at least $700,000. Then Jones would get a separate 
check from someone with no ties to the case -- $1 million from W York 
developer abe hirschfeld who says the country noods the case to be 
over. I am only doing it not for Clinton, not for any politicians. 
I am doing it for the people of erica. The possible deal all but collapsed 
yesterday because of infighting among all the lawyers. Jones' first 
set of lawyers faxed this letter to hirschfeld laying claim to $800,000 
of any payment to Jones. That's in addition to the $1.4 million her 
current lawyers say they're owed and to the $400,000 the Rutherford 
says it is owed for paying the legal expenses. In all that's $2.6 
million against a possible settlement. Which even if the lawyers lowered 
their fees doesn't leave much for Jones which is why her friend stepped 
into the negotiation. My job is to make sure that that Paula Jones 
receives her fair share. Late today after some of the lawyers further 
reduced their demands. A source said Jones authorized a final counteroffer 
to the president. I think if the president offered a million dollars 
along with the other mill hirschfeld, $2 million would at least put 
a huge dent in her legal bills. Tonight sources believe a settlement 
could come very ickly or talks could collapse entirely. The key -- 
whether the president and the first lady N live with the led line 
of a $2 million settlement even though half would be their money.
