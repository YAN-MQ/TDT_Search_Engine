Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Leader 
Yasser Arafat, each accompanied by their negotiating teams, are isolated 
at a secluded spot in the state of Maryland. They're preparing for 
a new day of talks and about rejuvenating the stalled mid-east peace 
process. The key issue is forging a security plan for Palestinians 
to fight terrorism in exchange for Israel's giving up more West Bank 
land. President Clinton opened the summit here in Washington, yesterday, 
before the meetings moved to the remote Maryland location where the 
three leaders dined together. Speaking to reporters at the Wye River 
Plantation, State Department Spokesman, James Rubin said the negotiators 
hope to address many of the interim issues that need to be resolved 
before the talks can move on to what's known as the final status agreement. 
The idea is that the interim committee was designed to deal with I 
believe there were four primary issues -- the Gaza industrial state, 
the airport, the seaport and the question of safe passage. Those are 
issues, that had the peace process been working successfully over 
the last nineteen months, one would have hoped that they could've 
been completed and the fruits of that economic um, the economic benefit 
that would've come from their completion would've been felt. We are 
in as we told all of you when we were in -- the Secretary was in Jerusalem, 
that we had made progress on some of them and reached some understandings 
on some of them. We do expect the interim committee issues to be part 
of what's discussed in the next three days. How many of them will 
be completed and whether some might be -- continued to be discussed 
up through the end of the interim period on May 4th is an open question. 
But clearly we've made, as we indicated in Jerusalem, uh, substantial 
and significant progress on interim committee issues. State Department's 
Spokesman, James Rubin addressing reporters that if an agreement is 
reached in these Maryland talks it will set a stage for final negotiations 
on the most difficult issues -- creation of a Palestinian State, the 
future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
