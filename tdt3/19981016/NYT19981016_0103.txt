Recent survey by a women's research group found that the boards of 
directors of 71 companies among the Fortune 500 were made up entirely 
of men. To those who have followed the results of such annual surveys 
by Catalyst, a nonprofit organization in New York, the news undoubtedly 
sounded familiar. After all, Catalyst has been saying for years that 
the percentage of women at the upper echelons of Corporate America 
remains small, though it is growing slowly: women hold 11.1 percent 
of the seats on Fortune 500 boards, up from 10.6 percent last year. 
Still, the fact that roughly 14 percent of the 500 largest companies 
do not have a single woman as a director raises a simple question: 
Why? The answers, according to more than 20 companies asked by The 
New York Times why they lacked a woman director, ranged from ``no 
comment'' to statements that they were searching for woman directors 
to explanations that they consider ability alone, and not gender, 
race or age, when seeking new directors. Quantum Corp., a disk-drive 
maker based in Milpitas, Calif., for example, said it would like to 
add a woman to its board, and that over the last five years, it has 
attempted ``targeted searches'' for female directors without success. 
Part of the problem may be Quantum's criteria: chairman and chief 
executive Michael Brown said its highest-priority requirement for 
board candidates was operating experience at the chief executive level 
at a company with $6 billion or more in annual revenue. Clearly, not 
many women fit that profile. But then, neither does anyone else on 
Quantum's current board, aside from its current chief executive and 
two former Quantum senior executives. (That, company officials said, 
is why Quantum has this priority _ to broaden the collective experience 
of the board.) Quantum's desire for a top-level executive with significant 
operating experience, which is shared by many other companies, is 
an important reason there are so few women on boards of large companies, 
said Dennis Carey, vice chairman for the U.S. practice of Spencer 
Stuart, an executive search firm that recruits directors for about 
250 boards a year. ``A significant percentage of them would love to 
consider bringing females on the board,'' Carey said. ``When you begin 
the process, you start with a very small pool that meet the criteria. 
But if you loosen the criteria, and look at executives responsible 
for significant functional areas, the supply issue begins to fade.'' 
``This is not a supply problem,'' Carey added. ``It is a criteria 
problem at the end of the day.'' Companies, however, have no women 
as directors for a lot of reasons, most of which Sheila Wellington, 
president of Catalyst, has heard before. For example, she said, many 
companies say their board searches are not based on gender. But the 
gender-neutral approach, Ms. Wellington said, ignores the fact that 
women represent 46 percent of the work force, make the majority of 
consumer decisions and can bring some different and valuable perspectives 
to a table otherwise encircled by men, even if the women are not chief 
executives or senior vice presidents. ``The notion that there aren't 
women that can add value to the work of corporate board is implausible 
at best,'' Ms. Wellington said. She added that one chief executive 
wrote in a 1995 confidential Catalyst survey: ``It's easy for boards 
to get club-like and ingrown. The notion of a bunch of old men who 
grew up in the same environment governing a company _ it's the best 
formula I know of for getting out of step in a changing world.'' The 
most thoughtful argument for not worrying about the relatively small 
number of women at the highest reaches of corporations, Ms. Wellington 
said, is that demographics alone will right the imbalance over time. 
As more women rise through the ranks, the reasoning goes, the candidate 
pool will inevitably grow. The problem, she said, is that Catalyst 
has consistently found a statistically significant link between the 
presence of women on corporate boards and in senior executive ranks: 
at companies where you find one, you tend to find the other. ``We 
don't know if there is a cause and effect,'' she said. ``But the phenomena 
appear to reinforce each other. If there isn't a commitment to make 
it happen on all fronts, it's not going to happen on any front.'' 
Catalyst estimated that at the current rate at which women are being 
added to the ranks of corporate boards, it will take another 66 years 
before boards are populated equally by men and women.
