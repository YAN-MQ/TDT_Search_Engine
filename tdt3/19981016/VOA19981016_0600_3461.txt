Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a short break. This is VOA News Now. In Albuquerque, New Mexico this 
week, cars clog the streets as a hospital began giving free drive-up 
flu shots. The hospital offered the vaccine to people over the age 
of 65 because getting the flu can be especially dangerous for older 
people. It was a three-stop process. At the first stop, passengers 
filled out paperwork. Then, they drove to the next station, where 
nurses waited on both sides of the vehicles ready to give the shots 
as efficiently as possible. Afterwards, at a refreshment stop, flu 
shot recipients were offered coffee and cookies. Veteran actor, Mickey 
Rooney has a new role. He's now the spokesman for the California Department 
of Aging. Mr. Rooney, who's 78 years old, says age is nothing more 
than experience. And, he says, life gets better with age. Mickey Rooney's 
primary task at the state's department is to help California's older 
people to learn about the government services available to them. It's 
coming up on 11 hours, Universal Time. We are now signing off to the 
Caribbean. Thanks for joining us and tune in again tomorrow at ten 
hours Universal Time for another edition of VOA News Now. Meanwhile 
if you're a listener in East Asia or the Pacific, we invite you to 
stay with us. As VOA News Now continues on short-wave on most of our 
present frequencies and these additional frequencies: 6.16, 9.645, 
9.76 and 15.16 Mhz short wave. It's eleven hours, Universal Time,
