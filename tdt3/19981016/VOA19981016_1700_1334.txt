Thank you, Dave. We'll have another sports update in about an hour. 
Business news will be along in about 30 minutes. And Dateline takes 
a look at whether bigger is always better for big businesses. And 
national economies. We'll also hear about the week's environmental 
news. So stay with us, for that and more, as VOA NEWS NOW continues.
