I'm Frances Alonzo, VOA News. The prestigious 1998 Noble Peace Prize 
has been awarded to David Trimble and John Hume of Northern Ireland 
for their part in working to settle the long running Sectarian Dispute. 
The announcement was just made in Oslo Norway. The choice for the 
coveted prize was made by the five-member Norwegian Noble Committee 
were among a record 139 nominees. Committee Chairman, Francis said 
that the solution chosen by Mr. Hume and Mr. Trimble in Northern Ireland 
can be an example for others for other leaders to follow. We do hope 
that as Swanson said in the -- the announcement, that the -- the solution 
that had reached so far in this Irish peace process and that is a 
process of inclusion. All parties should be included in the final 
arrangement -- peace arrangement. That this is that is a very important 
point to the committee. That this should serve as an example also 
for other countries. The peace prize will be presented to Mr. Hume 
and Mr. Trimble in Oslo on November 10th, the anniversary of the death 
of Sweden's Alfred Noble who created the prize. The honor includes 
a cash prize of more than $955,000.
