When we return a look at tomorrow's morning's news. At Cigna we care 
about people who have babies. We care about companies that make steel 
and about companies that make bread. We care about life. And about 
all that makes life great or possible or just better. At Cigna we 
care because it is our business to care. But we also care because... 
well, we have babies, too. Cigna. Two newspapers and a web site will 
represent our scouring of the nation tonight when look at tomorrow 
morning's news. "Denver post" will start us off. You can almost hear 
them howling at aarp headquarters. 44 million Americans getting social 
security checks will see them grow by just 1.3% next year. A speck. 
It is the lowest Cola or cost of living increase in 12 years. It's 
the cost of good intentions. It's the cost of low inflation. And the 
problem is those on social security will have to live with this negligible 
raise perhaps even while the economy begins to get south.
