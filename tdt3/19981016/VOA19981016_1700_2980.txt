The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8416, up 117 points. That 
represents a six percent gain for the week. Standard implores 500 
index, also up eight points, closing at 1056. NASDAQ, the technology 
dominated index gained eight and one half percent for the week. Reversing 
last week's seven percent decline. Analysts called it a nice way to 
end the week. The second cut in U.S. interest rates in three weeks 
mobilized buying. Trading volume was very heavy, a one billion share 
day. Clearly, the U.S. interest rate not-corporate earnings was the 
dominant story by week's end. Some are predicting the Federal Reserve 
Board will make even more cuts before the year is out to prevent the 
world economic slump from throwing the U.S. economy into recession.
