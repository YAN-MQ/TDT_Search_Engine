For a year, Edward Lecomte listened to an incessant stream of talk 
about ``the market.'' Friends boasted about booming stock portfolios, 
his sister made a bundle in a mutual fund and colleagues badgered 
him to jump on the bandwagon. So last winter, Lecomte, 37, decided 
it was time to become a player. He didn't work in finance _ he runs 
a school in New York that teaches English as a second language _ and 
he had no financial expertise. So he made an appointment with Fidelity 
Investments, expecting to walk out with a clear understanding of the 
markets and a plan for building a nest egg. He was sorely disappointed. 
``They speak a language I don't comprehend,'' he said. ``I told the 
guy that I didn't get it, but at a given point, you start feeling 
silly because it seems like it should be obvious. So you go away thinking 
you should have asked more questions, but you didn't because you were 
intimidated.'' He fled Fidelity without investing a dime. Then Lecomte 
went to the discount-brokerage firm Charles Schwab, thinking he would 
open an account and manage it himself, online, learning as he went. 
Alas, he left more frustrated than ever and still with no account. 
``There, it was a feeling that I was with the riffraff, the small 
investors,'' he said, ``whereas at Fidelity I felt like a top gun 
_ you didn't understand them, but at least you didn't wait around 
for 20 minutes.'' As Lecomte has discovered, choosing the person who 
will take charge of thousands of your hard-earned dollars and for 
all you know play roulette with your life savings _ can be daunting 
for neophytes. Horror stories abound about annoying phone calls, failed 
investments and less-than-savory characters. And then, of course, 
there's the jargon: high risk, low risk, buying long, selling short. 
But the search for a stockbroker, even in times of market turmoil, 
doesn't have to be unpleasant; in fact, done right, it can be a bit 
like looking for romance. You shop around, ask questions and play 
the field before settling down. Or better yet, you have friends set 
you up. ``You should be with someone you feel is intelligent and understands 
your financial needs and personality,'' said Ed Freiberg, 28, an associate 
producer for Chrysalis Sports, a television production company in 
Manhattan. He has had a brokerage account since he was in college. 
``If you're not aggressive and you don't want someone to be aggressive 
with your money, you need to make sure his style is compatible with 
yours.'' Vicky Landin, 34, a television director in Los Angeles, agrees, 
but adds that one need not always defer to the broker's judgment. 
She said she once entrusted her decisions to a a broker who talked 
her out of investing in a stock that shot up by $14 soon afterward. 
``It's easy to say, `You do it for me,' but you have to do your homework,'' 
Ms. Landin said. ``I found that out the hard way.'' Such tough-mindedness 
can come in handy when a broker pitches what he says is the hottest 
stock since Microsoft, when he really has a commission on his mind. 
``We have reputations of being like lawyers, and there are unethical 
people out there,'' conceded Angeline Garcia, a Wall Street trader. 
``I'd look for someone who says, `There are risks, and I'll probably 
be able to make you some money _ but I might not.' I appreciate honesty.'' 
The way Bobby Harrell, a Manhattan lighting designer, sees it, the 
only thing better than feeling comfortable with one stockbroker is 
feeling comfortable with two. For the last eight years, he has built 
up a friendly relationship with a broker at the firm now known as 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who he believes has his best interest at 
heart. ``I call up, ask a question, and within seconds he has information 
at his fingertips. I feel like he's interested in me and is not in 
it for the money,'' Harrell said. Even so, when he got a cold call 
a few years ago from a broker at Merrill Lynch, he was impressed enough 
with the man's financial savvy to hand over a chunk of his savings. 
``Everything he does is for the company; he probably has their logo 
tattooed on his chest,'' said Harrell, 36. ``But I was solicited by 
him and I wanted diversity, so I gave him about $3,000 to buy mutual 
funds.'' As for Lecomte, who beat a hasty retreat from both Fidelity 
and Charles Schwab, he's willing to try again _ someday. ``It's scary 
right now, but I realize I should make an investment,'' he said. ``I 
hear about assembly-line workers who have a million dollars because 
they invested in Coca-Cola 10 years ago, and I think, `I could do 
that.''' He also has a suggestion for brokerage firms: ``What they 
should do while you're sipping that awful coffee is give you a glossary 
of the terms they're about to throw at you. Maybe then more people 
would understand.''
