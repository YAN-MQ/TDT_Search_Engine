By a margin of nearly two to one, Israelis back an American proposal 
for Israel to turn over another 13 percent of the West Bank as part 
of an agreement with the Palestinians, an Israeli newspaper reported 
Friday. The Palestinians accepted the American proposal last March. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after initially rejecting 
the proposal, eventually agreed, on condition that 3 percent of the 
area be set aside as a nature reserve in which Israel retains full 
security control for the time being. The newspaper Maariv published 
a Gallup poll that said 57 percent of Israelis favor handing over 
13 percent, while 30 percent are opposed. The Israeli withdrawal is 
a key element in a series of interim peace agreements between Israel 
and the Palestinians. The last one was signed in January 1997. They 
call on Israel to hand over all of the West Bank to Palestinian civilian 
control in three stages, except for Jerusalem, Israeli settlements 
and designated military locations. But none of the pullbacks has been 
implemented. U.S. officials say the focus of the summit at Wye Plantation 
is reaching agreement on the size of the withdrawal, while reassuring 
Israel about security issues. The poll also showed that 82 percent 
of Israelis hope the summit meeting will end in agreement, but only 
52 percent believe it will. One thousand Israeli adults were questioned 
for the poll. The paper said the margin of error is 3.2 percent.
