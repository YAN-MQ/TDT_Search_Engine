With a look at you "Headline News" weather, I'm Karen McGinnis. The 
first major storm of the season develops across the interior west. 
It looks like some of the mountainous regions, especially in Utah, 
could see owe E E several feet of snowfall. Well farther to the north, 
it's mostly rain and ahead of the frontal system temperatures quite 
mild, with high pressure in control. Temperature-wise, for the pacific 
northwest where another round of rain is expected temperatures mostly 
in the 50s and through Montana, across portions of Wyoming and Utah, 
look for temperatures mostly in the 40s. That and the valley regions. 
70s and 80s dominate the southeastern United States. Breezy conditions 
expected across the Hawaiian islands. In our extended forecast, rain 
extends all the way from the Great Lakes and down along the gulf coast 
region. Temperatures are mild across the eastern seaboard, but as 
we head into the Monday forecast, they begin to back off a few degrees. 
40s and 50s across the U.S./Canadian border. And as I mentioned by 
Monday, those temperatures a bit cooler, especially across the central 
U.S. for more weather information, log on to CNN.com.
