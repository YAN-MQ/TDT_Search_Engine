Taste buds ready? Good. Today's geography quiz takes us to the South 
Pacific to sample some of the local fare. Today's mystery destination 
is an island group 1,300 miles north of New Zealand. It comprises 
about 320 islands, the largest of which are Vetilevu and Vanualevu. 
Until 1987, these islands were officially part of the British Commonwealth. 
In fact, large numbers of immigrants from another commonwealth state, 
India, came here in the late 1800s to work on sugar plantations. Today, 
tourism is a major part of this country's economy, not surprising 
when you consider that the average annual temperature is a balmy 80 
degrees. And the food, well, we learned one way the locals preserve 
something they've got plenty of: fish. In a few minutes, when we answer 
today's geography quiz.
