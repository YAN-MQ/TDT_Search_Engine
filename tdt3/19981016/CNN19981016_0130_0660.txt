NAto ambassadors are scheduled to meet Friday to decide if they'll 
extend a hold on air strikes against Serbian forces in Kosovo. NATO 
secretary-general Javier salano signed a deal that allows aerial surveillance 
of the province. And he sent a Stern warning to Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to comply with Tuesday's agreement. It requires 
Milosevic to begin peace talks with ethnic Albanians, withdraw his 
troops and permit 2,000 unarmed members of a verification team to 
take up positions in Kosovo. NATO officials say there's some evidence 
of troop withdrawal, but not nearly enough.
