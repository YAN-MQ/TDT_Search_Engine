John Hume and David Trimble on Friday won the Nobel Peace Prize for 
their efforts to resolve the three-decade-old Northern Ireland conflict 
culminating in the peace agreement signed this spring. They were cited 
by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for work toward ending ``the national 
religious and social conflict in Northern Ireland has cost over 3,500 
people their lives.'' ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest 
and most consistent of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his 
work for a peaceful solution,'' the committee said in its citation. 
``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in Northern 
Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage when, at a critical 
stage in the process, he advocated solutions which led to the peace 
agreement,'' the citation said. The committee also noted that the 
peace agreement that was signed in April also was the work of other 
Northern Ireland political leaders, as well as the governments of 
the United Kingdom, the United States and Ireland. The prize of 7.6 
million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be divided equally between 
Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54. Hume, contacted by Norwegian television 
NRK, said he believes the prize will ``strengthen our peace process 
enormously.'' That outlook was echoed by Norwegian Nobel Committee 
head Francis Sjerested, who said after the announcement that the committee 
hoped the award would ``give (the peace process) a push forward.'' 
The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named this 
year. The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian 
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and other 
catastrophes. On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, 
Horst L. Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton 
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how electrons 
can change behavior and act more like fluid than particles. The chemistry 
prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of California at Santa 
Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern University for developing 
ways of analyzing molecules in chemical reactions. On Monday, the 
medicine prize was given to three Americans _ Robert Furchgott, Louis 
Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on discovering properties 
of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but also a life-saver because 
of its capacity to dilate blood vessels. The literature prize was 
awarded last week to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago. The prizes 
are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, 
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established 
the prizes in his will.
