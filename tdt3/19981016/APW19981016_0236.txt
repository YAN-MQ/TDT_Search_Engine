John Hume and David Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's two 
main political parties, on Friday won the Nobel Peace Prize for their 
efforts to end the sectarioan violence that plagued the British province 
for three decades. They were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee 
for work toward ending ``the national religious and social conflict 
in Northern Ireland has cost over 3,500 people their lives.'' Their 
work culminated in a peace agreement signed this spring. ``John Hume 
has throughout been the clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland's 
political leaders in his work for a peaceful solution,'' the committee 
said in its citation. ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant 
party in Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage 
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions which 
led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said. The committee also 
noted that the peace agreement that was signed in April also was the 
work of other Northern Ireland political leaders, as well as the governments 
of the United Kingdom, the United States and Ireland. The prize of 
7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be divided equally 
between Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54. At a news conference shortly after 
prize announcement Hume said: ``Well as you would expect, I am very 
deeply honored to have received this award today, but I see it not 
as an award for myself but as a very powerful international approval 
of the peace process in Northern Ireland and a very strong international 
approval of peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.'' The peace 
prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named this year. 
The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian scholar 
cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and other catastrophes. 
On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L. Stormer 
of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton University 
won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how electrons can change 
behavior and act more like fluid than particles. The chemistry prize 
went to Walter Kohn of the University of California at Santa Barbara 
and John A. Pople of Northwestern University for developing ways of 
analyzing molecules in chemical reactions. On Monday, the medicine 
prize was given to three Americans _ Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro 
and Ferid Murad _ for their work on discovering properties of nitric 
oxide, a common air pollutant but also a life-saver because of its 
capacity to dilate blood vessels. The literature prize was awarded 
last week to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago. The prizes are presented 
on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish 
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes 
in his will.
