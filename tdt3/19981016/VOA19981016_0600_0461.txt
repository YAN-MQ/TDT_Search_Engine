Another troop pull-back is in the headlines following the freshly 
brokered cease-fire arrangement in Kosovo. Top NATO officials visited 
Belgrade and left after telling President Slobodan Milosevic to comply 
with U.N. demands. VOA's Arch Chimes is in Belgrade and reminds us 
those demands focus on withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo province. 
NATO Secretary, General Javier Solana had met with the Yugoslav Leader 
then told reporters Belgrade still has many army and special police 
units in Kosovo in violation of Security Council Resolution 1199. 
Mr. Solana said that the units must be withdrawn immediately and he 
emphasized the NATO will keep up the pressure until Belgrade fully 
complies with the UN demands. We will remain ready and willing to 
act if these obligations are not met. Let me say, very clearly also, 
that NATO and their native countries prefer compliance to conflict. 
NATO Tuesday gave Yugoslavia four days to withdraw its forces and 
take other steps demanded by the U.N. Security Council. Yugoslavia 
has withdrawn some of its forces from Kosovo but not enough to satisfy 
the west. Under an agreement signed Thursday and Belgrade, NATO patrol 
planes will begin flights over Yugoslavia to ensure full compliance. 
A separate agreement due to be signed Friday will pave the way for 
2,000 unarmed monitors on the ground. The verification system follows 
intensive negotiation by American Diplomat, Richard Holbrooke more 
than seven months of fighting in Kosovo between Serb forces and separatist 
ethnic Albanian gorillas drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. 
Many continue to live out in the open, afraid to return home as the 
harsh Balkan winter approaches. Arch Chimes, VOA News, Belgrade.
