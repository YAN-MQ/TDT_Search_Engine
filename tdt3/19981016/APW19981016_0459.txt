An international envoy on Friday denounced Yugoslav authorities for 
closing down three independent dailies and two radio stations critical 
of the regime. Authorities this week closed the major independent 
Nasa Borba daily and banned two other newspapers _ Dnevni Telegraf 
and Danas, saying recent reports on NATO threats against Yugoslavia 
violated a broad ban on ``unpatriotic behavior.'' ``I asked foreign 
minister Zivadin Jovanic about the reasons of such undemocratic measure,'' 
said the head of the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, Bronislaw Geremek. ``The answer that I obtained was that 
the situation was exceptional and this measure concerns only this 
exceptional situation,'' said Geremek, who was in Belgrade to sign 
a pact providing for OSCE's surveillance of the secessionist Kosovo 
province. Yugoslav authorities say foreign and independent media reports 
of Serb actions in Kosovo have aggravated the crisis in Kosovo and 
that reports of NATO threats and developments surrounding them could 
cause widespread alarm. The decree against unpatriotic behavior was 
issued last week and applies to individuals, businesses and institutions 
alike. Open to interpretation and misuse, it was presented as necessary 
at a time of possible attack from abroad. In a letter to Geremek, 
the newly formed Coordinating Committee of independent media in Belgrade 
said, ``We appeal to you and the organization you stand for to rise 
to the defense of independent media that are now being jeopardized 
by the regime under the pretext of alleged NATO threats.'' ``The regime 
continues repression, which has now reached dramatic proportions,'' 
the committee said in the letter. The U.S. State Department and several 
other countries and media organizations have condemned the latest 
media clampdown. Members of Nasa Borba's editorial staff said Friday 
that they would appeal the closure. But their lawyer noted that no 
media have ever won a case against the state. ``The attacks and repression 
against independent media are only a part of the overall pressure 
on freedom and critical thought in this country,'' said Novak Pribicevic, 
an editor of Nasa Borba. On Oct. 11, authorities shut down Belgrade's 
Index Radio and Radio Senta, citing their lack of a broadcast license. 
Index and some other members of the Association of Independent Electronic 
Media have for years been denied licenses, giving the government the 
leverage to shut down any of them when they become critical of authorities.
