The fed's action came as a surprise to many. Bill dorman looks at 
what spurred the change. The fed's action marks the first time since 
March 1994 that the fed has moved rates between meetings of the open 
market committee. It clearly reflects the fact that Alan Greenspan 
and probably some other members of the federal reserve board now recognize 
the seriousness of the global economic crisis. And what started out 
as a crisis in Asia a year ago is now spread to Russia, Latin America, 
starting to spill over at the U.S. economy. The question is, will 
lower interest rates be enough to offset some of these very Negative 
fundamentals around the world? Nobody knows for sure. I happen to 
think that this will reduce the likelihood of a recession in 1999, 
but the U.S. economy is bound to get weaker as a result of the calamities 
that are going on in Asia, Russia and maybe even Latin America. In 
a brief statement, the fed noted -- weak economies overseas may have 
been a spark, but fears of a domestic credit squeeze are now hitting 
the United States. We've seen a very significant slowdown in corporate 
profits. And that's really creating a problem for businesses, because 
they -- that means they aren't generating the money internally to 
finance their projects. They've got to go to the capital markets. 
The capital markets are frozen. 8 of the 12 regional fed banks requested 
the rate cuts. The ones that did not -- Dallas, Boston, Cleveland 
and Richmond. Attention now shifts to the next meeting of fed policymakers 
on November 17th. Bill dorman, "CNN Financial News," Washington.
