Mean while the NAto deadline set for tonight for Serbia to get its 
troops out of Kosovo has been extended for another week and a half. 
Serbian President Mitch Slobodan Milosevic is reluctant to remove 
the special police units. NAto secretary general said that although 
Milosevic is pulling some of his other troops out a NAto strike force 
is ready for action if he fails TO meet the new deadline.
