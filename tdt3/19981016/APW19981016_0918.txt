The Kuwaiti officer who was appointed prime minister after Iraq's 
invasion in 1990 has defected to a European country, an Iraqi dissident 
group said Friday. Col. Alaa Hussein Ali has arrived in a European 
country after being granted refugee status by the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees in Turkey, said an official of the London-based Iraqi 
National Congress. The official refused to reveal the country in a 
telephone interview from his office in London. The report could not 
be independently confirmed. A UNHCR spokesman in Ankara said the agency's 
confidentiality rule barred him from discussing individual cases. 
Alaa was an obscure lieutenant in the Kuwaiti army when Iraqi forces 
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 1990. He was summoned to Baghdad, promoted 
to colonel, and named as prime minister of a 9-member ``Provisional 
Kuwait Free Government.'' Alaa had studied management at Baghdad university 
and was a member of Iraq's ruling Baath Party, the dissident group's 
radio, Iraqi Broadcasting Corp., said in a statement received in Cairo. 
One week after the invasion, Alaa was seen on Iraqi television asking 
President Saddam Hussein to unite Kuwait with its big neighbor. Hours 
later Baghdad announced that Iraq had annexed Kuwait and Alaa disappeared 
from public view. The radio called Alaa ``the Quisling head of Saddam's 
puppet government'' after the Norwegian officer who supported the 
German invasion of Norway in 1940 and was appointed ruler. The radio 
said Alaa left Iraq via Jordan and arrived in Turkey on Aug. 13, accompanied 
by his wife and four children. Alaa had been trying to defect since 
1994, but was refused permission to leave Iraq, the Iraqi National 
Congress official said. ``Lately he told them (Iraqi authorities) 
that he wanted to visit his parents in Amman (Jordan) because they 
were sick,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Alaa was then granted permission and entered Jordan on an Iraqi passport, 
the official said. The UNHCR arranged his resettlement in a European 
country, the official added. Alaa has nine sisters and brothers living 
in Kuwait, the radio said.
