The roster of value players at Franklin Mutual Advisers will remain 
the same after the chief executive officer, Michael Price, gives up 
his management duties next month, but they will be getting new positions. 
Specifically, the senior analysts who have long executed the Mutual 
Series team-based investing have been named as managers and co-managers 
of the individual funds. The new lineup at the $26 billion fund group 
is as follows. Ray Garea, a senior analyst, will run Mutual Qualified, 
helped by the assistant manager, Jeff Diamond. Larry Sondike, also 
a senior analyst, will be co-manager for Mutual Beacon and Mutual 
Shares, the first with David Winters, and the latter with David Marcus, 
both senior analysts. Mutual Discovery, which invests in smaller companies 
globally, will have as co-managers Robert Friedman and Marcus, who 
will also take sole stewardship of Mutual European. Finally, Garea 
will also manage Mutual Financial with an assistant manager, Jim Agah. 
All the managers will be supervised by Friedman, who becomes chief 
investment officer in November. What does this mean for investors? 
The three biggest and oldest funds, Beacon, Shares and Qualified _ 
which have long been managed as virtual clones, with the analysts 
spreading their ideas among them _ are likely to develop differences, 
say outside analysts. The new approach answers the funds' need for 
micromanagement, according to Peter Langerman, who becomes the chief 
executive in November. ( Price sold his fund company to Franklin Resources 
two years ago and in July announced his plans to relinquish management 
duties.) ``When you have hundreds of stocks in a fund, they have to 
be watched as closely as the bigger positions,'' Langerman said. The 
three funds hold roughly 300 stocks each. ``This is an attempt to 
have portfolio managers focus on a particular fund, as opposed to 
running money as a large pool,'' he said. As of June 30, the three 
funds shared 7 of their 10 largest stock holdings. They are Chase 
Manhattan, Investor A.B., Media One, General Motors, Railtrack, Suez 
Lyonnaise des Eaux and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The funds have 
lagged behind their peers this year, largely because of their investment 
in Sunbeam. The fund company says such cross-fertilization will not 
change. ``We still expect the largest positions to be reflected across 
the board in all the funds,'' Langerman said. ``A good value idea 
is a good value idea, and everyone wants to participate.'' But the 
new structure may address a common criticism of the funds, said Susan 
Belden, editor of No-Load Fund Analyst, an investing newsletter. ``Now 
they can say they've split up the large pool of money, and it's being 
managed by different people,'' she said. How can investors distinguish 
among the three domestic large-cap offerings? Langerman and Friedman 
offered these guidelines: Qualified holds a bigger range of large- 
and mid-cap stocks; Beacon has the biggest chunk of foreign issues, 
at 35 percent, plus large-cap stocks, and Shares holds the smallest 
portion of foreign issues, 15 percent, and focuses on large-cap, not 
mid-cap, stocks.
