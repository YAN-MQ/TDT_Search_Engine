U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is appealing for calm 
in the midst of world-wide economic turbulence. She spoke Thursday, 
at a director's meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers, 
in Washington. As we hear from VOA's Rick Nunez, Ms. Barshefsky also 
reaffirmed President Clinton's commitment to get fast track authority 
to negotiate trade deals. ] Charlene Barshefsky views the financial 
panic that erupted in Asia, as the most dangerous economic predicament 
the world has faced in half a century. Ms. Barshefsky warns the crisis 
which spread to Russia, and now looms over Latin America. Threatens 
jobs and growth all over the United States. She says the tangible 
effects of the shock have already reached U.S. shores. These days, 
about two in every five containers leave the Port of Los Angeles, 
empty. This is a graphic illustration of the downturn in our goods 
exports. Our exports to Japan this year, in goods, is expected to 
drop by about eight billion dollars. To China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
about three billion. To the rest of Asia, 20 billion, perhaps. Our 
trade with Latin America is suffering as well. The Port of Miami just 
reported a 12 percent drop in two-way trade this year. NUNEZ: The 
U.S. trade official says Washington's top priority must be to work 
with the International Monetary Fund to help countries hit by the 
turmoil keep their currencies stable. And mobilize economic recovery 
programs. It is just as important, she adds, for the United States 
to keep its markets open during the economic storm. We beseech other 
countries not to respond with protectionism. We also must not respond 
with protectionism. We have to keep our market open and available. 
Or else we will be hurt. Our trading partners will be hurt. The crisis 
will get worsened, and we will be in a viscous cycle. Ms. Barshefsky 
points out that nearly 80 percent of the world's consumption takes 
place beyond the United States. Making U.S. exports all the more important 
in the coming years. Rick Nunez, VOA NEWS, Washington.
