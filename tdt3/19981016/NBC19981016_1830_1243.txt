"Living longer, living better" tonight -- an issue that touches just 
about everyone as we get older, memory loss. If you can't remember 
where you left your glasses, help may be on the way. Scientists are 
optimistic. Memory-boosting medicines may be coming soon. Here's NBC 
chief science correspondent Robert Bazell. Imagine a day when a simple 
pill can help solve one of the most frustrating problems we all face 
-- memory lapse. It could help you remember where you left your keys, 
the birthdays of family and friends, the name of someone you recently 
met or the news you read last week or last year. Experts say that 
day could come soon. I think we will have a pill for treating age-related 
memory loss within a decade. "age-related memory loss." Starting at 
about age 20, we lose, on average, 6% of our memory every ten years. 
That means when you're 50, you have 18% less memory than when you 
were 20. When you're 70, you have 32% less. Generally, you lose the 
ability to remember new things -- called short-term memory. Long-term 
memories remain intact. Drugmakers are looking for a way to stop that 
decline. One company thinks it has found it with a drug tested in 
these rats. In animals, you can show doubling of memory within five 
minutes. Gary Lynch's company, cortex, has created a new class of 
drugs called "ampikines." When given the drug, rats get much better 
at performing a memory task. In this test, they must press a lever, 
and after time passes, they must remember which lever they pressed 
to get a reward. The initial effects were so dramatic that we actually 
had to replicate this study two more times before we actually believe 
it ourselves. If these drugs work in humans, they would first be used 
for treating Alzheimer's and other diseases that destroy memory. Then, 
cautiously, scientists would try to enhance the memories of healthy 
people. In fact, researchers are studying more than 50 drugs as possible 
memory enhancers, though progress can be difficult. I can tell you 
from our experience over the past 20 years that it's a lot easier 
to make rats smart than humans. Still, as scientists learn more about 
how memory works, real promise for "living longer, living better," 
remembering more. Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
