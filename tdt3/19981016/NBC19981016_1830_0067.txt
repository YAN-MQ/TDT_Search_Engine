Good evening. If the economy were a cowboy song, the lyrics might 
be, "if the stock market is back up, why am I feeling so down?" The 
market, propelled by bargains and another cut in interest rates, was 
up again today, at the end of a week in which it made its biggest 
point gain ever. The Dow was up 117 points today. NASDAQ, almost ten 
points. For the week, the Dow was up 517 points. NASDAQ was up more 
than 128 points for the week. But this doesn't mean all is well or 
that the market is back to its glory days of earlier this year. Here's 
CNBC's Ron Insana. Tom, indeed it was a very good day for the Dow. 
But many professional investors I spoke with today said the unusual 
timing of the fed's decision, very late on a Thursday and between 
regular meetings, leads them to believe the fed itself is more concerned 
about Wall Street than most people realized. A day after the surprise 
rate cut ordered by fed chairman Alan Greenspan himself, not all the 
news was good. The drop in interest rates should have pushed all bank 
and brokerage stocks higher again today, because lower rates can dramatically 
increase their profits. But instead, prices of several key financial 
stocks fell. Bankers trust, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley, all down 
today amid worries that big financial firms may suffer even more significant 
losses soon. A lot of people think that after the second time the 
fed eases, it is time to get bullish but I don't thing we are ready 
to rock and roll yet. And as worries on Wall Street grow, more evidence 
that the overall economy is slowing down. One key indicator -- industrial 
production, the output of factories down 3% last month. Economists 
expected it to go up. Another troubling sign -- the average earnings 
of American workers, down last month by .6%, the biggest drop in more 
than two years. The economy continues to weaken and confidence erodes, 
you will see another rate cut. And they will keep cutting until the 
economy gets up. They said they were not having any serious financial 
difficulties but they hope that they keep cutting rates so that no 
firm has any problems that could deal the market another set back.
