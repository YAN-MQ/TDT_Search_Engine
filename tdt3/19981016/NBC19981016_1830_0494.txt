President Clinton could be facing a first round of embarrassment on 
Monday when the judge in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit 
releases a batch of documents, although it appears that the president's 
deposition will not be released. Meanwhile, the president's attempts 
to settle with Paula Jones is getting more complicated. Renewed hope 
of a settlement in the Paula Jones case came as a new lawyer stepped 
in to stop feuding among all of Jones' other lawyers about how much 
each would get from a deal. The settlement now being discussed calls 
for President Clinton to pay Jones at least $700,000. Then, Jones 
would get a separate check from someone with no ties to the case -- 
$1 million from New York developer abe hirshfeld, who says the country 
needs this case to be over. I am only doing it, not for Clinton, not 
for any politician -- I am doing it for the people of America. The 
possible deal all but collapsed yesterday because of infighting among 
all the lawyers. Jones' first set of lawyers faxed this letter to 
hirshfeld, laying claim to $800,000 of any payment to Jones. That's 
in addition to the $1.4 million her current lawyers in Dallas say 
they are owed and to the $400,000 the Rutherford institute says it's 
owed for paying Jones' legal expenses. In all, that's $2.6 million 
in legal bills against a possible $1.7 million settlement, which, 
even if lawyers lowered their fees, doesn't leave much for Jones -- 
which is why her friend Bill McMillan, a lawyer, stepped into the 
negotiations. My job is solely to make sure that Paula Jones receives 
her fair share. Late today, after some of her lawyers further reduced 
their demands, a source said Jones authorized a final counteroffer 
to the president. I think Paula would settle for the $1 million that 
Tonight, sources believe a settlement could come very quickly, or 
talks could collapse entirely. The key -- whether the president and 
the first lady can live with the headline of a $2 million settlement 
even though only half would be their money. Lisa Myers, NBC news,
