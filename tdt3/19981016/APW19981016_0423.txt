Leftist leader Massimo D'Alema was awaiting the nod Friday from Italy's 
president to try and form a new government. President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro was expected to tap D'Alema after finishing a round of consultations 
with political leaders around midday. D'Alema, 49, leads the Democratic 
Left, the largest party in what was _ until a week ago _ the governing 
Olive Tree majority. Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government 
fell after it lost the support of hard-line Communists, who said his 
deficit-cutting budget didn't do enough to create jobs. On Thursday, 
Prodi told Scalfaro he had failed to cobble together a new majority. 
D'Alema's chances, like Prodi's, will depend on his ability to win 
the backing of centrist and somehow guarantee their tranquil coexistence 
with his Communist allies. Some observers say that could mean giving 
cabinet appointments to both. The Communists split during their budget 
battle with Prodi, with a breakaway faction led by Armando Cossutta 
backing him in the confidence vote. Cossuta's new party, the Italian 
Communists, has already given its blessing to a D'Alema, a former 
Communist himself. However, the hard-line Communist Refoundation, 
led by Fausto Bertinotti, says it will negotiate with D'Alema only 
if he agrees to changes in the budget. D'Alema will also have to deal 
with the centrist party of former President Francesco Cossiga, who 
rebuffed Prodi. After meeting with Scalfaro Friday, Cossiga said he 
thought the chances were good for creating a coalition with room for 
both centrists and Communists, and said he was willing to negotiate 
with D'Alema. ``We won't rule anyone out,'' he told reporters. Prodi's 
2 1/2-year-old government had been the second-longest-lived of Italy's 
55 governments since World War II.
