A motorist was killed Friday when a bomb exploded in his car in southern 
Lebanon, security officials said. Ali Alawiyeh, 52, was killed instantly 
when the bomb, weighing about three kilograms, exploded at 8 p.m. 
(17:00 GMT) as he was driving through the village of Qulalieh, 18 
kilometers (11 miles) south of the port of Tyre, the officials said, 
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. It was not known whether 
the bomb was intended to kill Alawiyeh or whether he was on a mission 
to kill somebody else. Villagers said Alawiyeh, a scrap-metal dealer 
in Qulalieh, did not belong to any militia or political party. Car 
bombings are rare in south Lebanon, unlike roadside bombs, which the 
Hezbollah guerrillas have often detonated under vehicles of the Israeli 
army and their allied Lebanese militia in the Israeli-occupied zone. 
However, earlier this year a car bomb killed a senior official of 
the Syrian-backed Amal guerrilla group which, like Hezbollah, fights 
to oust Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. Amal blamed Israel for 
the attack.
