Somehow the Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel, with its harpist and doilied 
dessert plates, seems like the last place where Grace Slick would 
want to meet. But here she comes, dressed mostly in black, looking 
startlingly like herself even though the Feed Your Head Queen of Jefferson 
Airplane, the voice that launched a thousand trips with her 1960s 
anthem ``White Rabbit,'' turns 60 next year. Judging from how good 
she looks, either she took far fewer drugs than anyone imagined, or 
the cosmetics industry should start marketing an LSD eye cream. She 
has the same tough-girl stance as always, striding unsmiling through 
the center of the room wielding a black Guess bag. She seems to make 
a point of carrying it so the word ``Guess'' faces out. Why the Palm 
Court? ``I don't know New York too well,'' she says, though she did 
spend a year at the now-defunct Finch College. ``I would fly in to 
do a job and fly back out. We would stay here or at the Park Lane 
Hotel.'' Her husky voice takes on an I-dare-you edge. ``All I know 
about the Plaza is their rooms are smaller than the Park Lane, and 
Elaine, whatever that kid was, was at the Plaza.'' She looks for the 
shocked response to her garbling of Eloise; when there is none, she 
seems a bit let down. ``Also,'' she continues, ``the Plaza is across 
the street from F.A.O. Schwarz.'' Why is that important? ``I collect 
stuffed animals, and toy stores make me happy,'' she says. The edge 
goes, and she smiles like a 6-year-old. In less than three minutes 
she has gone from jaded road tripper to snide rule breaker to sweet 
child. You can see why Airplane founder Marty Balin once said, ``Whoever 
slept with Grace had the power in the band.'' Ms. Slick is a genuine 
endurance test. The real reason for her unlikely appearance here among 
the teacups is to promote her autobiography, ``Somebody to Love: A 
Rock-and-Roll Memoir,'' with Andrea Cagan (Warner Books). Retired 
from performing since 1989, Ms. Slick feels free to spill some beans 
about the seamier side of peace, love and pharmaceuticals. Along with 
Janis Joplin, she was a cultural icon of the '60s. Unlike Joplin, 
she is alive and aging, the mother of a 27-year-old daughter, a veteran 
of two marriages and countless relationships, and an admitted alcoholic 
who has struggled with sobriety for the last 23 years. She has landed 
in jails and hospitals for everything from drunken driving to assaulting 
an officer to wielding a shotgun. But as always with Ms. Slick, though 
she writes about details sure to fascinate die-hard boomers (Mick 
Jagger's furniture was Louis XIV; sex with Jim Morrison was swell), 
the power is in the performance. In person, she seems more complex 
than on the page. What's most interesting is not the ancient history, 
but her sense of self in 1998. Born to an investment banker and his 
Mayflower-descendant wife, Grace Wing (an Anglicization of the Norwegian 
name Vinje) grew up mostly in Palo Alto, Calif. She married a neighbor, 
Jerry Slick, with whom she founded her first band, the Great Society, 
and gained recognition on the San Francisco music scene. She was soon 
recruited by Jefferson Airplane and made her name nationally as the 
bad girl incarnate, beautiful and dangerous, a rebel with a cause, 
who delighted in creating social upheaval. (When her daughter, by 
her fellow band member Paul Kantner, was born, she put ``god'' on 
the birth certificate. Her real name is China). Ms. Slick has no interest 
now in reinventing herself as a singer. She knows that she defines 
the '60s, but she does not want the '60s to define her. ``You either 
evolve or you don't,'' she says flatly. ``I don't like old people 
on a rock-and-roll stage. I think they look pathetic, me included. 
And the fact that I represent an era means I can't just go out there 
and do all new stuff. They would all say, `Sing ``White Rabbit,'' 
' and I'd say no? That's rude. But can you see me singing `Feed your 
head' as a practicing nonalcoholic? It doesn't make sense now.'' Though 
Ms. Slick tends to stress her identification with the '60s, she tends 
to downplay the fact that she is equally a product of her privileged 
'50s upbringing. Despite her deriding Finch as a finishing school 
where she learned things like ``how to use a finger bowl (don't drink 
it),'' its effects are ingrained. She sits at the Palm Court for two 
hours, and though she neither eats nor drinks, she unfolds her napkin 
and places it on her lap. When she frets over a ragged fingernail, 
she pulls a nail file from her purse (where she keeps her makeup in 
a plastic Ziploc bag) and looks guiltily over her shoulder. ``Is this 
cheesy, doing this here?'' she asks. ``It's my Episcopalian upbringing 
not to do this at the table.'' Then she catches herself, and her tone 
changes. ``I was doing a TV interview recently, and the hairdresser 
said, `Let's poof this hair up a little bit.' And I said: `I don't 
do poofs, honey. I'm not the poofy type.''' As her hair stays resolutely 
'60s, long and straight, so does her outfit. Though she calls the 
black matte pants she is wearing ``boot cut tights,'' they look an 
awful lot like bell-bottoms. And while the silver ornament around 
her neck looks like a cross, she insists it is a Celtic arrow. ``I'm 
more inclined to wear weapons,'' she declares. OK, OK. If she never 
sings ``White Rabbit'' again, it is clear that the renegade image 
she has so carefully cultivated will not go gently into the night. 
Maybe that's because she's famous for it, or maybe it's because that's 
who she is. As a child, she writes, her parents dubbed her ``The Grouser.'' 
To this day, nothing seems to please her as much as devising any variation 
on the word ``no.'' And her dismissal of fame and its trappings (her 
own doesn't count somehow), her disdain for the hordes climbing the 
corporate ladder or inching their way up the country-club food chain, 
is as staunch as ever. She spends most of her time now at her home 
in Malibu, Calif. (her Marin County house was destroyed by fire in 
1993), drawing and making jewelry out of hardware. ``I do what I love 
to do, what I choose to do,'' she says defiantly. ``I find it amusing 
on one level, poignant on another, when people try to get recognition 
from an outside source. It's sad.'' Does that mean she doesn't care 
that her book has received some negative reviews? She nods. ``It's 
going to be that way with anything you do. Some people aren't going 
to like it. Hopefully. I mean, what if everybody liked it? You would 
have fallen into some strange pocket. The word `success' _ who's defining 
it? It's about whether or not it makes ME feel good. Four billion 
people don't have to see or hear it. If I've enjoyed the process of 
creation and I'm at peace, then what happens next is just entertainment. 
If mass appeal were actually something, Marilyn Monroe wouldn't be 
dead. ``Applause is interesting,'' she goes on, ``but I'm a monster 
with or without it. Something is either well written or it isn't. 
`White Rabbit' is not well written, and no amount of applause or royalties 
can convince me it is. I could have done a better job with those lyrics. 
They didn't say what I wanted. And there are other songs I wrote that 
never got on with Airplane that are fabulous. The whole public thing 
does not make up who I think I am.'' And that is? ``I'm responsible. 
I show up, pay the bills. I've never bounced a check, never slapped 
China around. A friend of mine used to listen to Airplane and figured 
he could just take drugs and plop through life. He heard what we were 
saying and misinterpreted it. On your day off you could get weird, 
but you can't just go loony tunes.'' Ms. Slick's parents died in the 
mid 1980s. Were they simply horrified by her? She shakes her head 
and smiles. ``They were relatively conservative,'' she says, ``but 
they both had good senses of humor _ wry and sarcastic. They appreciated 
the fact I was doing something I liked and making money at it. But 
the drugs and getting arrested and all the wacko stuff, they were 
worried about. `Oh, Grace, why do you have to do those drugs or yell 
at the police?' '' she says, assuming what seems to be her mother's 
voice. `` `Don't yell. It's not tasteful.''' ``You know, one entertainment 
I've always had is to watch people lose their minds over something 
that is totally unimportant. If I stand up now and say, `Happy birthday,' 
here in the Plaza, everyone would turn around and say, `That's nice.' 
But if I stood up and cursed, they wouldn't. Neither one has anything 
to do with their lives, and it just amuses me to watch how poorly 
we're taught.'' She leans forward. ``I won't do it,'' she says, ``but 
if I was drunk, I might.'' The waiter arrives to take a lunch order, 
but Ms. Slick demurs. In the last few years she has developed a medical 
condition that makes her feet feel as if they'd been plunged into 
boiling water. It is aggravated by hot weather and by eating, which 
raises her body temperature. One consolation is her improved relationship 
with her daughter. In interviews past, China Kantner, an actress, 
has volubly complained about having a mother who refused to give up 
her touring career to stay home with her. Ms. Slick nods, almost wearily. 
``I'm sure that China might have at some point preferred that both 
her father and mother were home more often,'' she says. ``And she 
might have preferred I was less distant, figuratively as well as literally. 
I'm not a big Italian mama. I don't communicate that way.'' She looks 
surprised by her own candor. She rallies. ``I'm not interested in 
having people touch me unless they want to have sex with me. I like 
the Japanese method of bowing. I'm Norwegian, what do you expect?'' 
She sighs. ``All kids realize at some point that they have to get 
off the fact that their parents aren't something or are something.'' 
Like her mother, China Kantner has abused alcohol since she was a 
teen-ager. ``She's sober awhile,'' Ms. Slick says, ``then thinks it 
would be fun and goes back. It's the same pattern as Mom. Hopefully 
we both can manage it this time out. For me, it's getting so that 
the drama is not so interesting anymore. It's too much trouble. Maybe 
I'm getting lazy.'' What is she doing instead? ``I'm doing what I 
did when I was a kid,'' she says, ``listening to music, drawing, reading, 
hanging out with a few friends. I guess I'm going into the final drooling 
round-blob stage.'' Abruptly, she turns the conversation toward death. 
``I want more life,'' she says. ``I think its really rude to be cut 
off in midcontinuity. If I died now, I wouldn't find out if they impeach 
Clinton or who China marries. Death is like taking an intermission 
when you can't come back. I like living and being around. But there 
might also be another level that's really fascinating. I think of 
myself as a positive agnostic. I don't know, therefore I'm open. I 
don't know, therefore I'm interested.'' She hears herself, and crosses 
her arms. Selling a book is one thing; baring your soul to the sellout 
press is another. She waits for the next question, and when it comes, 
gloats at the softball. Is there anything in her life that she wants, 
but doesn't have? ``Yeah,'' she says, grinning. ``A flat stomach. 
I'm easy to please.''
