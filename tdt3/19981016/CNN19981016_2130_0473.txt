Typhoon zeb roared across Taiwan today and is bearing down on the 
southern islands of Japan. Torrential rains triggered floods that 
have caused extensive damage in Taiwan. At least 12 people there are 
dead. Most schools are closed, and air travel has been disrupted. 
Zeb claimed at least 74 lives when it hit the Philippines this week. 
The casualty figure is expected to rise.
