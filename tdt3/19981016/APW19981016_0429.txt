Russia's defense minister predicted Friday a peace deal with Yugoslavia 
will hold thanks to Russia's mediation. ``We fully control the situation 
(in Kosovo), follow its development and hope it will be settled by 
peaceful means,'' Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said. ``The peace 
process has become irreversible.'' Sergeyev spoke after a meeting 
with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Chumakov, to discuss the 
situation in Yugoslavia and their shared opposition to NATO's eastward 
expansion. He said they worked out ``concrete steps'' to counter NATO's 
move to incorporate the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, but refused 
to elaborate. Chumakov said that the Belarusian military would be 
the ``first echelon'' of joint defenses against NATO, the Interfax 
news agency said. Russia and Belarus have signed a union agreement 
that stopped short of full merger but envisaged broad political, economic 
and military ties. Both countries staunchly oppose NATO's expansion 
and spoke out against NATO's proposed airstrikes on Serbia, with which 
they share common Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion. 
Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko has promised to help Serbia 
with weapons if NATO proceeds with airstrikes. Russia's Defense Ministry 
issued a similar warning last week. Sergeyev said he didn't discuss 
such aid at the meeting with the Belarusian military on Friday. Russia's 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also sounded content Friday as he praised 
Moscow's role in settling the conflict. ``Russia's voice has been 
heard,'' Ivanov was quoted as saying by Interfax. Another top Foreign 
Ministry official, Vladimir Chizhov, said a military action against 
Serbia would be ``an erroneous and regrettable step,'' Interfax reported. 
Russia's Foreign Ministry also welcomed the signing of an agreement 
Friday to allow 2,000 international ``verifiers'' provide firsthand 
reports on whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is honoring 
the deal to end the Kosovo crisis. The deal was signed with the 54-nation 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Brussels, Belgium. 
Meanwhile, Communists and other hard-liners dominating the Russian 
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, proposed that Russia hold 
naval exercises ``near Yugoslavia's Adriatic coast and the U.S. Sixth 
Fleet.'' While reflecting hard-line sentiment, the proposal has no 
practical meaning because the Russian parliament has no say over the 
government's foreign policy.
