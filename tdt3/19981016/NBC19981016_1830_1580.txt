The nobel peace prize was awarded today, as expected, for the agreement 
that brought a measure of peace and the promise of much more to northern 
Ireland. Many were involved in that effort, including former U.S. 
senator George Mitchell. But everyone agrees it would not have happened 
without David trimble, a Protestant leader, and John Hume, a Catholic. 
So they will receive the coveted prize. And everyone agrees no one 
has been at this longer or with greater passion than John Hume. John 
Hume has been trying to bring an end to this for more than 30 years. 
Even when it seemed hopeless, John Hume never lost his wanting to 
do something. Well done, John! Then -- a local hero. And today -- 
a hero known 'round the world. It strengthens our peace process enorm 
owsley. Hume's hero -- a leader from another time, another place. 
Hume says it is Martin Luther king's message of nonviolent change 
that inspired him. I thought that if 20,000 soldiers on our streets 
couldn't stop the killing on our streets, and direct dialogue could, 
it was my duty to do so. Duty born of the hope his father taught him 
growing up in a poor, Catholic and divided town. His father's most 
valued lesson? One man can make a difference, and every man should 
try. Eventually he would join an lead the movement for peace. Then, 
1972, bloody Sunday -- the worst of northern Ireland's guerilla war. 
When we were attacked in the civil rights movement, I always said, 
"do not retaliate. Let the world see who the real aggressor is." That 
peaceful approach would lead to years of secret and eventually publicized 
talks with divided factions. Cease-fires would come and go. With thousands 
of lives lost, Hume's persistence finally pays off when this year's 
intense talk brings about an historic handshake. They hoped they had 
finally managed a peace. This agreement proves that democracy works. 
American statesman George Mitchell acted as chief negotiator. There 
wouldn't have been a peace process without John Hume. Mitchell says 
the violence will not disappear overnight. Indeed, only weeks after 
the agreement, a shocking setback -- more deadly bombings. Now, uncertainty 
lingers. But John Hume does not give up hope. Hope that his children 
will grow up in a peaceful Ireland, that his prize will not have been 
won in vain.
