Ransom Lydell guessed right 17 years ago when he thought there would 
be a booming market for the lily-like perennials called hostas. But 
spotting an opportunity is one thing and exploiting it is another, 
as millions of failed entrepreneurs have discovered. Today Lydell, 
59, runs one of the most successful hosta businesses in the country, 
mostly because he has figured out how to differentiate himself from 
his rivals in flower-selling. If you happened into the Corner Snack 
Bar here around noon on a recent weekday and witnessed him in his 
trademark pith helmet, digging into a plate of flapjacks and trading 
gossip with the other regulars, you would probably not have picked 
him out as a marketing genius. But appearances can be deceiving. When 
he had his brainstorm in 1981, Lydell knew a thing or two about flowers. 
As the owner of a small landscaping business, he understood that outdoor 
floral displays could work magic on consumers' wallets. And, as a 
graduate of the state Agricultural and Technical Institute at Alfred, 
he realized that hostas, unlike roses and other popular flowers, were 
nearly virgin territory for the creation of new varieties through 
hybridization. Today his Eagle Bay Hosta Gardens, a three-acre sanctuary 
of bridges, ponds, arbor and faded red barn, contains 800 hosta varieties 
and 15,000 plants. Outsiders can meander freely around it anytime 
they happen to be passing through this hamlet in the grape country 
of Chautauqua County, near Lake Erie. ``It's incredibly important 
for people to see how the flowers they're buying will eventually look,'' 
he said. And on any day during the growing season, the enthusiasts 
wander in, video cameras in hand. Some are from as far away as Europe 
or Asia. In his research operation, Lydell has 1,000 hybrids ``under 
observation'' _ monitoring them over six or seven years for flower 
color, form, height, uniqueness of the leaf pattern and resistance 
to slugs, a scourge of hostas. Once satisfied, he ships the hybrid 
off to the University of Minnesota, home of the worldwide hosta registry. 
If his variety is accepted, he can sell the first 100 plants, the 
flower world's equivalent of first-issue postage stamps, for a total 
of $1,500 to $10,000. His record sale for a single plant was $350. 
Currently, Lydell has registered some 18 varieties. He calls his most 
recent creation Saybrook Surprise and his favorite, which resembles 
a yucca plant, Yucca Ducka Do. On the sales side, he is determined 
not to be outdone by the big mail-order flower merchants. He has his 
own Internet site (http://vinetime.com/eaglebaygardens/index.html) 
chock-full of hosta news and, of course, order forms. But since gardeners 
can be technophobes, he continues to publish his color catalog and 
accept orders by phone, fax and plain old snail mail. Sales have doubled 
every year in the last four years. Profits are up, too, enabling Lydell 
to buy his dream vacation home on Lake Erie not long ago. His second 
pith helmet is almost worn out, but Lydell has no plans to retire. 
``You've got to be kidding me _ my youngest girl wants to go to medical 
school,'' he said. He is expanding his flower park with picnic tables, 
public restrooms, a gazebo, a miniature tropical garden, an Alpine 
forest and a Japanese teahouse. To be sure, the hosta business is 
not without its intrigue. ``There's a master plant thief who works 
out of New York City,'' Lydell whispered conspiratorially. ``He's 
stolen plants from the emperor's gardens in Japan. It's like any other 
field where beautiful objects can sell for several thousand dollars 
_ serious collectors can get desperate.'' So far, Lydell's biggest 
problem with theft does not involve people. Last summer, some local 
deer became fond of feeding on his best hosta, a $3,000 variety. He 
tried everything to drive them off until he discovered that there 
was one thing they couldn't abide: country-and-western music on the 
radio. ``The deer loved classical and soft rock _ it made them eat 
even faster,'' he says. ``I finally found an upscale country station, 
which they absolutely hate. Now they have to go to the Corner Snack 
Bar, just like the rest of us.''
