John Hume and David Trimble, the leaders of Northern Ireland's two 
main political parties, on Friday won the Nobel Peace Prize for their 
efforts to end the sectarian violence that plagued the British province 
for three decades. Hume, 61, head of the predominantly Roman Catholic 
Social Democratic and Labor Party, and Trimble, 54, leader of the 
Ulster Unionist Party, were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee 
for work toward ending ``the national religious and social conflict 
in Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.'' 
Their work culminated in a peace agreement that was concluded and 
ratified this spring. ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest 
and most consistent of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his 
work for a peaceful solution,'' the committee said in its citation. 
``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in Northern 
Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage when, at a critical 
stage in the process, he advocated solutions which led to the peace 
agreement,'' the citation said. The committee also noted that the 
peace agreement that was accepted in April was the work of other Northern 
Ireland political leaders, as well as the governments of the United 
Kingdom, the United States and Ireland. In the days leading up to 
prize, the Norwegian news media largely assumed that an award to Northern 
Ireland would also include Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political 
wing of the Irish Republican Army. At his news conference, Norwegian 
Nobel Committee head Francis Sejersted was asked if the committee 
had shunned Adams because of the IRA's terrorist history. He refused 
to discuss the deliberations of the committee. ``We don't shy away 
from anyone. We just try to find the most appropriate laureates,'' 
Sejersted said. ``I can only repeat that many people have contributed 
to this process, not in the least Gerry Adams.'' The prize of 7.6 
million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be divided equally between 
Hume and Trimble. At a news conference shortly after prize announcement 
Hume said: ``Well as you would expect, I am very deeply honored to 
have received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself 
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process 
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of peace 
for all the people of Northern Ireland.'' Trimble, in Denver on a 
trip to promote investment in Northern Ireland, called the award ``a 
great honor, but it's not for me personally and I think people shouldn't 
look at it in that light.'' He said it belonged to the people of Ireland 
``who have longed so much for real peace to come.'' ``And I hope very 
much that this award doesn't turn out to be premature, because there 
is still work to be done to secure peace in Northern Ireland,'' Trimble 
said before rushing off to a meeting of potential investors. Hume's 
diplomacy has been credited with providing a major boost to the peace 
process. It was Hume who envisioned the broad agenda for the discussions, 
arguing they must be driven by close cooperation between the British 
and Irish governments, be overseen by neutral figures, and their results 
be ratified by public referendums in both parts of Ireland. Hume began 
the thaw in Belfast's frigid political landscape in 1993 by courting 
Adams in hopes of securing an IRA cease-fire. Trimble would have been 
viewed as a peacebreaker more than a peacemaker three years ago. He 
was elected Ulster Unionist leader in 1995 after championing the rights 
of Protestants and has since battled to keep control of his party 
_ and his party at the talks table. He refused to talk directly to 
Adams during the eight months Sinn Fein was at the same table, knowing 
to do so would risk political suicide. But he bit off more than many 
observers thought he could manage in April's agreement, watching key 
aides abandon him as he accepted a deal that would allow imprisoned 
IRA members go free without ironclad assurances that the outlawed 
group would disarm. It was the second time the Nobel committee sought 
to encourage peace in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty 
Williams and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for their peace 
efforts in founding the International Peace People group, which later 
fizzled. ``We did hope it would have more of an effect than it did,'' 
said Sejersted. But he said that just illustrated what a long and 
complicated process seeking peace in Northern Ireland has been. Sejersted 
said the committee knows that there is a risk of setbacks and renewed 
violence even after the Belfast peace accords were concluded in April. 
But ``it indicates that the process is going in on the right track, 
and that there is reason for optimist,'' the chairman said. ``We wanted 
to give it a push.'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish 
counterpart Bertie Ahern, both mentioned a possible winners of this 
year's peace prize, immediately praised the decision. ``There could 
be no more worthy winners of the Nobel Peace Prize than David Trimble 
and John Hume,'' said Blair in London. ``This is a recognition of 
their courage and their qualities of leadership.'' Ahern called it 
``a deserved tribute to two of the principal architects'' of the peace 
agreement. The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to 
be named this year. The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya 
Sen, an Indian scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of 
famine and other catastrophes. On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford 
University, Horst L. Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. 
Tsui of Princeton University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering 
how electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than particles. 
The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of California 
at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern University for 
developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical reactions. On Monday, 
the medicine prize was given to three Americans _ Robert Furchgott, 
Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on discovering properties 
of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but also a lifesaver because 
of its capacity to dilate blood vessels. The literature prize was 
awarded last week to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago. Last year's 
Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Jody Williams of the United States 
and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines for their efforts 
to ban antipersonnel mines because they kill more civilians than soldiers. 
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death 
of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite 
who established the prizes in his will.
