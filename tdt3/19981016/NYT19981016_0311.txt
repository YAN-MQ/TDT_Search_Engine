Here's a quiz to see if you are keeping up with the head-snapping 
political swerves in Washington. Was the following said by a congressman 
in a) praise or b) condemnation of President Clinton? ``Now let me 
tell you, often in our lives, in our personal lives, we have choices: 
Do you want instant gratification, or do you want to do the responsible 
thing for yourself and your family and others, for the future?'' If 
you answered b), you are hopelessly mired in the past of, oh, two 
or three days ago, when folks were still talking about a scandal involving 
a certain former intern. Hard to remember back that far, actually. 
The words were said by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt _ who has 
been a sharp critic of Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky controversy 
_ to laud the president's rejection of Republican tax-cut proposals. 
Gephardt, with other Democrats, had crowded around Clinton in the 
Rose Garden on Friday morning to drench him with praise, like jubilant 
football players with a tank of Gatorade. Meanwhile, it was the Republicans 
who were left Friday to grouse about their party's standard-bearers. 
The cause of all this celebration and consternation, of course, was 
the budget deal, which many conservatives declared won on the president's 
terms. For his part, backed up by dozens of Democrats, Clinton basked 
in the bright sunshine and gave his most rousing campaign speech of 
the political year. ``Eight days of progress cannot totally erase 
eight months of partisanship,'' he said. ``We all know that in those 
eight months of partisanship, too many dreams of too many families 
were deferred.'' What Clinton on Friday called ``a dizzying week'' 
in Washington left some experienced political hands stunned. ``All 
this hubbub about a $500 billion bill and `My God, we saved the environment 
for you, we saved Social Security,''' said former Rep. John Anderson, 
R-Ill., who ran for president as an independent in 1980, after watching 
Clinton on television. ``I just sat there, scratching my head. Here's 
a guy who was on the canvas, and he's acting like he's just starting 
to fight.'' Fred Greenstein, a historian and expert on the presidency 
at Princeton University, said Clinton had reason for confidence, having 
done better than anyone could have expected since Aug. 17, when he 
acknowledged an affair with Ms. Lewinsky. He said Clinton had rallied 
once-panicked Democrats behind him by playing the budget game skillfully 
and maintaining his high public approval ratings. The reversal of 
political fortune, he said, was ``full of anomalies and paradoxes 
_ like who would imagine a president would be strengthened by being 
the third person to have impeachment hearings?'' But, Greenstein said, 
the president ``seems to have to be in some extremely adverse situation 
to really use his formidable political talents to good effect.'' If 
Clinton ``gets any weaker,'' wrote political columnist Paul A. Gigot 
in Friday's Wall Street Journal, ``Republicans may pass Hillary's 
health-care plan.'' Stomach-churning reversals have been a constant 
of Clinton's political career. A breakdown in the Mideast peace talks 
or another drop in the stock market could make him appear weak again, 
and the impeachment inquiry will grind on. For all the Democrats' 
new-found bravado, they are unlikely to break the historic pattern 
of losses by presidential parties in midterm elections. ``I think 
the Republicans probably are going to get their act together enough 
in the remaining two weeks of the campaign to hang on,'' said Anderson, 
a visiting professor at Nova Southeastern University Law School who 
analyzed congressional races this year for the Center for Voting and 
Democracy. Friday, Clinton appealed urgently to Democrats to go to 
the polls, to counteract what is expected to be a larger Republican 
turnout. ``Staying home is not a very good option when so much is 
riding on a trip to the ballot box,'' he said. In a sign of the cold 
political reality he faces, Clinton flew to Chicago on Friday afternoon 
to appear with Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., and raise $500,000 
for Senate Democrats. Moseley-Braun trails her opponent, who is far 
better financed, by as much as 12 points in recent polls. Saying that 
``elections are always about tomorrow,'' Clinton declared that he 
had a ``different view of a lot of things than some people'' who live 
in Washington. ``I tend to evaluate people based on what they do that 
affects the lives of people back home,'' he said, as demonstrators 
protested against him outside. Clinton rattled off a list of issues 
that Democrats should run on, including fixing the Social Security 
system, rebuilding schools and raising the minimum wage. At the White 
House, some aides allowed themselves a bit of satisfaction at seeing 
opponents flummoxed, even if briefly. ``You would think after the 
last six years of making the mistake of counting him out and predicting 
demise, those who have made a career out of doing that would take 
a deep breath,'' said Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser who is leaving 
Clinton's service next week after seven years. But Emanuel added that 
he had developed a maxim during his years of evaluating instant political 
reviews. ``You're never as good as they say you are,'' he said, ``and 
you're never as bad as they say you are.''
