Hello, again from Washington, I'm Frank Whitis. The prestigious 1998 
Noble Peace Prize has been awarded to David Trimble and John Hume 
of Northern Ireland for their part in working to settle the long-running 
sectarian dispute. The announcement was made in Oslo, Norway. The 
choice for the covenant prize was made by the five-member Norwegian 
Noble Committee from among a record 139 nominees. The honor includes 
a cash prize of more than $955,000. The peace prize will be presented 
to Mr. Hume and Mr. Trimble in Oslo on December 10th, the anniversary 
of the death of Sweden's Alfred Noble, who created the prize.
