Australian center Steve Renouf scored two tries Friday as the Kangaroos 
beat New Zealand 36-16 to claim their rugby league test series 2-1. 
New Zealand won the opening test in April and was trying to beat Australia 
in a series for the first time since 1953. But a rejuvenated Australian 
team under coach Wayne Bennett, who replaced Bob Fulton following 
the opening test loss, stormed to two convincing wins a week apart. 
Renouf was one of several Australians, including Bennett and captain 
Allan Langer, who claimed trebles after winning the National premiership 
for Brisbane and State of Origin series for Queensland also this year. 
``It has been a fantastic series, the Kiwis were very tough and they 
played very well,'' said Langer, who had been dropped for the first 
test. New Zealand leaves Friday for a three-test series against Britain 
and is sure to look positively at its performance despite losing the 
series. ``We got well beaten, it was very frustrating, but all isn't 
doom and gloom for us,'' Kiwis second rower Stephen Kearney said. 
``The young guys came through well and we'll go away to Britain knowing 
we've got a lot to work on.'' Kiwi captain Quentin Pongia was also 
looking ahead. ``We would have really liked to have won this. It is 
really disappointing but we've got three tests against the Poms and 
the young blokes like Tony Puletua and Nathan Cayless showed they 
have got it,'' Pongia said. Australia led 16-8 at half-time and the 
Kiwis tried hard to stay in touch. But the visitors made sure of the 
win with an exhilarating try to Darren Smith, who finished it off 
in the right-hand corner after the ball was pushed through 15 sets 
of hands. Scorers: Australia 36 (Steve Renouf 2, Jason Hetherington, 
Jason Smith, Darren Smith, Brad Thorn, Darren Lockyer tries; Lockyer 
3 goals, Andrew Johns 1 goal) def. New Zealand 16 (Daryl Halligan, 
Tony Puletua tries; Halligan 4 goals).
