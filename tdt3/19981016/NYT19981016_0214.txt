Confidence stemming from the Federal Reserve Board's second interest 
rate cut in three weeks spread further through financial markets Friday, 
as stock prices registered strong gains in heavy trading and bond 
yields fell. By the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average, 
which soared more than 330 points Thursday in an enthusiastic response 
to the rate reductions orchestrated by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, 
advanced another 117.40, or 1.41 percent, to 8,416.76. For the week, 
the blue-chip index was up 6.55 percent. Broader market averages also 
posted healthy gains. Capping its best week in 14 years, the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 8.93 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent 
to 1,056.42. For the week, the index gained 7.31 percent, its best 
showing since the week of Sept. 3, 1984, according to Birinyi &AMP; 
Associates. And the Nasdaq composite index concluded its best week 
in 24 years, rising 9.94 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,620.95. 
For the week, the Nasdaq, home of many fast-growing technology companies, 
soared 8.6 percent. ``The benefit of what Mr. Greenspan did for stocks 
on Thursday is not so much an indication that the Fed will provide 
liquidity to the system, but to instill a sense of confidence in the 
system again,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter. ``To some degree, things have shut down in financial 
markets, due to a loss of confidence,'' Olesky said, referring to 
what has happened since Russia defaulted on its sovereign debt in 
August. ``You don't have to look very far now to realize that people 
are much more constructive on the market.'' The gains left all three 
major indexes in positive territory for the year. Since the first 
day of trading in January, the Dow is up 6.4 percent, the S&AMP;P 
500 is up 8.9 percent and the Nasdaq composite is up 3.2 percent. 
Shares of small companies, which have been battered so far this year, 
also finished with strong gains. Two stocks rose for every one that 
fell in price. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company shares gained 
8.06 points, or 2.4 percent, to 342.87. At more than 1 billion shares, 
volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the fourth-busiest in the 
history of the Big Board. In large measure, the interest rate cuts 
by the Fed have generated hope among investors that the central bank 
will do all it can to avert a downturn in the American economy by 
cutting interest rates further. The sense that the Fed is prepared 
to cut the overnight Federal funds rate, currently at 5 percent, still 
further is readily apparent in the credit markets. Although yields 
on 30-year Treasury bonds rose marginally, to 4.98 percent from 4.97 
Thursday, the rate on three-month Treasury bills, the rate most sensitive 
to changes in the overnight Federal funds rate, fell by 30 basis points, 
to a bond equivalent yield of 3.61 percent. It was the biggest one-day 
drop in the three-month bill rate since the summer of 1992. ``We are 
going to get more rate cuts, maybe at the next Fed meeting in November,'' 
said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. 
Louis. ``The Fed is our friend.'' Short-term rates were also responding 
Friday to continued rumors that a big bank or other financial institution 
is near failure. As they often have in recent days, the rumors focused 
on the health of Bankers Trust, which is expected to release its third-quarter 
earnings report next week. Friday, Bankers Trust came under heavy 
selling pressure in the stock market, losing 5 9/16, to 51 5/16, on 
a day when most financial stocks posted good gains. Indeed, prices 
of regional bank stocks, which have lost about one-third of their 
value since July, were among the market's leaders Friday. Bank One 
gained 2 13/16, to 47 15/16. Keycorp climbed 2 15/16, to 31 1/8. U.S. 
Bancorp rose 1 3/8, to 40 15/16. And SunTrust gained 1 1/8, to 68 
3/16. Transportation stocks, led by airlines, roared ahead. The Dow 
Jones transportation index jumped 116.59 points, or 4.4 percent, to 
close at 2780.87. Among the biggest gainers were Delta Air Lines, 
which rose 4 1/2, to 98. AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained 
1 7/8, to 56 3/8. And US Airways Group gained 4 5/16, to 54 7/16. 
Hopes that the Fed might be able to stave off a recession helped to 
lift cyclical stocks Friday, as prices of automobile, steel and chemical 
companies all rose. General Motors gained 2 15/16, to 59. Ford Motor 
was up 2 1/16, to 50 13/16. And USX gained 1 3/8, to 23 5/8. ``The 
Dow is up almost 1,000 points since its close on Oct. 8,'' Goldman 
said. ``We are not going to just sail from here, but I think we saw 
the lows on Aug. 31.''
