Fiscal police are investigating Dutch soccer's league leader, Feyenoord 
Rotterdam, for suspected tax evasion and fraud involving millions 
of guilders (dollars), a spokeswoman said Friday. Tax authorities 
seized the club's accounting books Tuesday and conducted searches 
of other offices, said Carola de Kimpe of the Rotterdam Public Prosecutor's 
office. Authorities also questioned club chairman, businessman Jorien 
van den Herik. No arrests have been made. De Kimpe said the tax offenses 
are believed to have happened ``a few years ago.'' In an initial reaction, 
the club described the investigation as ``a difference of opinion'' 
between it and tax authorities. The dispute is over the payment of 
taxes on transfer fees paid by the club for foreign stars.
