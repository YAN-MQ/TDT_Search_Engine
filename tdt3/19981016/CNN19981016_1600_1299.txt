Mike Sammond, "Headline Sports." Two weeks after having surgery for 
colon cancer, Darryl Strawberry has left the hospital. He will begin 
six months of therapy now, and should be able to play next season. 
It was a very difficult time, but now that time is over. I am so pleased 
and delighted with the fact that, you know, the cancer has been removed 
from me, and I can move forward from this point. Game one of the world 
series is tomorrow night with the Yankees hosting the padres. The 
pitching matchup features a pair of 18-game winners, Kevin brown against 
David Wells.
