All eyes were on Wall Street to do see what the market would do after 
yesterday's incredible run Yun. Wall Street made history today. That 
wasn't the history. This was. It meant posting an all-time record 
one-week gain of 517. Sdaq also posted a one-week record rise. Two 
days of gains. However, don't make a bull market. Some professional 
investors say they're concerned about the unusual timing of the federal 
reserve's decision yesterday to lower interest rates. Unusual is really 
putting it lightly. It came out of nowhere. It wasn't supposed to 
happen when it did. It was announced between the fed's regular meetings 
which leads some to believe that some of the fed governors might know 
something necessity don't. Re with that from CNBC Ron Insana. A day 
after the surprise rate cut ordered by fed chairman Alan Greenspan 
himself, not all the news it was good. The drop in interest rates 
should have bushed all bank and brokerage stocks higher again today 
because lower rates can increase their profits. Instead prices of 
several key financial stocks fell. Bankers trust, J.P. Morgan, rgan 
Stanley all down today amid worries that big financial firms may suffer 
even more significant losses soon. A lot of people think that after 
the second time the fed eases, it's time to get bullish. But I don't 
think we've ready to rock 'N' roll yet. As worries on Wall Street 
grow, more evidence that the erall economy is slowing down. One key 
indicator -- industrial production, the output of ctories down .3% 
last month. Economists expected it to go up. Another trouble sign. 
The average earnings of American workers down by .6% the biggest drop 
in more than two years. If the economy continues to weaken, confidence 
erodes you will then see another rate cut. They'll keep cutting until 
they get to the points where the economy kicks up and expands. Bankers 
trust told my colleague it was not having any serious financial cities. 
Many on Wall Street hope the fed will keep cutting rates to sure that 
no firm has troubles that could was another market setback?
