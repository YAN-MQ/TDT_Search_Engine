``I've got a calm personality, so I don't get too excited when we 
go way up, and I don't get too down when we go way down,'' Gary Lewis, 
the manager of the Van Kampen Emerging Growth fund, said from his 
45th-floor office in Houston. This is fortunate, for funds like Lewis', 
invested in mid-cap stocks with relatively high price-to-earnings 
ratios, have taken it on the chin. Through Oct. 9, the fund has lost 
29.8 percent since the market's peak on July 17, nearly double the 
16.7 percent lost by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index of large-cap 
stocks, and even a tad worse than its average peer mid-cap growth 
fund, which lost 29.4 percent, according to Morningstar, the Chicago 
financial publisher. But even though the fund's assets have fallen 
from more than $4.8 billion at the market peak to $3.47 billion now, 
it has yet to see significant defections. Apparently investors and 
brokers have faith in Lewis' impressive long-term record. Since Lewis, 
45, started managing Van Kampen Emerging Growth in April 1989, the 
fund has returned 17.5 percent annually on average through Oct. 9, 
compared with 11.8 percent for its peers and 16.6 percent for the 
S&AMP;P 500. How does Lewis cope with these careening markets? Discipline. 
He keeps adhering to his basic investing principles. It may not prevent 
investors from losing money in a selloff, he said, but picking and 
holding the right stocks can keep a portfolio poised for a comeback 
when the market turns. Lewis looks for two basic characteristics in 
a stock. First, he wants companies identified by Wall Street analysts 
as likely to see their earnings grow, generally at a rate of 20 percent 
or more annually. Second, in what must seem heretical to value-oriented 
investors, Lewis seeks out companies whose price-to-earnings ratios 
are on the rise, believing that increasing ratios are the market's 
way of showing that further good news is around the corner. He also 
sometimes looks at price-to-sales ratios, especially for companies 
whose earnings might be skewed by such things as one-time expenses 
and write-offs. A price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratio that is 
not rising is a sign of trouble with a company, he believes, even 
if earnings estimates and earnings are increasing. ``That tells us 
that the company is delivering great fundamentals, but for some reason 
the market is not rewarding them for those good fundamentals,'' Lewis 
said. He believes that the reason is usually that ``the market is 
starting to anticipate that those fundamentals are going to change.'' 
A stock in this situation may become a candidate for sale. Lewis rejects 
the term ``momentum investor,'' often applied to adherents of high 
price-to-earnings investing, because he looks closely at fundamentals 
and does not indiscriminately buy companies with rising earnings. 
For example, he uses a yardstick common to growth investors: he prefers 
a stock whose P/E ratio is lower than the number associated with its 
forecasted one-year earnings growth rate. Lewis acknowledges that 
his frameworks for decisions to sell are not well suited for market 
downdrafts, when P/E ratios drop no matter what the fundamentals of 
the companies are. But in more bullish markets, he said, ``It's a 
good early warning indicator that there is a change in perception.'' 
Last year, for example, the fund had big investments in petroleum-industry 
service companies. ``All those companies had huge earnings growth 
expectations,'' Lewis said. However, their valuations started dropping 
in the fourth quarter. ``By the end of the first quarter, we were 
basically out of the group,'' he said, and the stocks, already falling 
by then, subsequently sold off with a vengeance. The fund's biggest 
holding is Dell Computer, which he started buying in 1996 and which 
now accounts for 6.6 percent of the portfolio. Lewis paid an average 
price of about $4.50. Dell closed last week at $56.6875. ``After we 
bought the stock in mid-1996 and the fall of 1996, we had a lot of 
Wall Street analysts downgrading the company because the stock had 
appreciated up to 15 times trailing earnings,'' Lewis said. ``But 
today, the company is at 60 times trailing earnings.'' Another technology 
stock, Yahoo Inc., is the fund's 12th-largest holding. Lewis acknowledged 
that the booming Internet company's share price is steep. It traded 
at 269.5 times 1998 earnings last Friday. But its 1998 earnings growth 
should grow by far more than that, he said. Lewis started buying the 
stock early this year, and paid an average of $51. Yahoo closed last 
week at $115.625. When Lewis began moving into the retail sector last 
year, one of his biggest buys was Best Buy, which sells personal computers, 
software and consumer electronics. He began buying shares last fall 
at an average price of about $22. Best Buy closed at $41 last week. 
To track valuation on this company, Lewis said, he looks more at the 
price-to-sales ratio than at the price-to-earnings multiple. ``If 
you looked at a chart of its price-to-sales ratio, you could see it's 
going straight up,'' he said. ``That's the kind of thing that clues 
us in as to there's a real strong fundamental change.'' He said in 
the case of Best Buy, there were a lot of factors at work. Many of 
the company's competitors have closed since 1996, Best Buy has changed 
its product mix for better customer appeal and profitability, and 
a shift to digital electronics is spurring demand for its products. 
A recession could change that, and ``Wall Street is buying into a 
pretty serious recession'' in 1999, he said. But he does not believe 
such predictions, even though stock prices have been hit hard. ``Right 
now I don't think there's a fundamental basis for what we've been 
seeing in the market,'' he said. ``There's just a lot of panic going 
on.''
