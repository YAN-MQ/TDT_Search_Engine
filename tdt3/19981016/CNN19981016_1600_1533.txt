A 75-year-old woman becomes young again, and a teen-ager watches her 
family evolve through six generations. Those are some of the TV specials 
you can catch this weekend. Ron tank has a preview. Television is 
aging this weekend. First, in NBC's "will of their own," the story 
of the changing role of women in America. It's seen through the eyes 
of six generations of one family. Amanda, your grandmother, Veronica. 
Oh, you look so much like William. Lea Thompson is Amanda Steward, 
a photojournalist who begins the story as a 17-year-old girl. By the 
time the two-night miniseries concludes, Thompson is 90 years old. 
My greatest accomplishment is that the women I came from and the women 
who came from me had the courage to follow their hearts. Ellen burstyn, 
Sonia braga and Faye Dunaway portray prominent historical figures. 
"A will of their own" begins Sunday on NBC. Over at CBS, the idea 
of becoming young again is the subject of "Emma's wish." hey. Are 
you going to tell me what you wished? no. If I did, it wouldn't come 
true. Sweet dreams. Della Reese stars with Joanna Kerns in this story 
of a woman who wishes for youth so she could become friends with her 
daughter. And, yes, Kerns plays both the young and the old woman. 
Now, how many hours in are we, guys? About an hour and a half. This 
is really good for an hour and a half, don't you think? Rubber casts 
and several hours of makeup create the illusion. Isn't that amazing? 
Because you look at it and it's you! It's fun, it's a fairy tale. 
There's nothing to take from this. It's a -- it's a fairy tale, and 
you would -- I would hope that they would enjoy it without judgment 
and speculation. Mona? Something has happened. Oh, my lord. It's not 
your dream, it's my dream. You had the $100,000 makeover. "Emma's 
wish" is granted Sunday. Ron tank, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
