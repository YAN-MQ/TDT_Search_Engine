The winner of Spain's prestigious Planeta literary prize, Uruguayan 
writer Carmen Posadas, said Friday she believed herself to be ``the 
anti-cliche of a writer.'' Posadas, 44, told reporters she hoped that 
winning the 50 million peseta (dlrs 350,000) prize for her novel `Pequenas 
Infamias' (Minor Disgraces) would draw public attention to her work. 
Posadas admitted that her sometimes frivolous image had damaged her 
credibility as a writer, although it was ``very useful for selling 
perfume or running a boutique,'' the national news agency EFE quoted 
her as saying. Born in Montevideo, Posadas gained notoriety in Spain 
through her mocking of Madrid's jet set during the 1980s economic 
boom in television programs and in her books. She is married to Mariano 
Rubio _ former governor of Spain's central bank who fell from grace 
in 1994 amid an insider dealing scandal.
