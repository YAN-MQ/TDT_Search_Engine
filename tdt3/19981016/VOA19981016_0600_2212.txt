Thursday, surprised interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, 
the Central Bank and the subsequent surge on Wall Street may send 
stock markets soaring across Asia. Share prices in Tokyo posted their 
first gains in four trading days, advancing more than 2 percent. Markets 
in Singapore and Hong Kong surged more than 7 percent in the morning 
session. Following the cut in two key U.S. interest rates Thursday
