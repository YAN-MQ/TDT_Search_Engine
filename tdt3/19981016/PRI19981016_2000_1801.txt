Tanzanian police and FBI officers have appealed for information on 
two cars they say might have been used in the August bombing of the 
U.S. embassy in Dar Es Salaam. Eleven people died in the attack, which 
was overshadowed by the much more devastating one in Nairobi. The 
BBC's Cathy Jenkins reports. At a news conference, FBI officials and 
Tanzanian police said they had been unable to trace the owners or 
the history of the vehicles. Two people, an Egyptian and a Tanzanian, 
were last month arrested and charged with the murder of 11 people 
who died in the embassy attack. The investigation being carried out 
by the Tanzanian authorities has been focusing on the water tanker 
which -- up at the embassy compound moments before the blast and was 
destroyed in the explosion. The BBC's Cathy Jenkins reporting.
