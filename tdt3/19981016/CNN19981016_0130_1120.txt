The gender gap in the boardroom is getting smaller. According to a 
report from the catalyst research organization, the number of women 
sitting on the boards of fortune 500 companies has increased more 
than 11% from a year ago. The number has been increasing consistently 
for the past five years. Despite the trend, researchers predict there 
won't be an equal number of men and women on corporate boards until 
the year 2064.
