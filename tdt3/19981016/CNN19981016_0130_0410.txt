A Massachusetts jury has awarded $37,000 to a prison inmate, in a 
strange case of revenge. The inmate claimed prison officials did nothing, 
while a guard harassed and beat him. Here's what makes the case unusual 
-- the guard who abused him, is the man he shot to get in jail in 
the first place. The inmate says the abuse continued over four years 
and that one prison official told him -- "I don't know what you expect,M 
you shot the guy in the head."
