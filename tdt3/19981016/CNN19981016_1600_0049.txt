An extra $10 a month. That's the reality of social security benefits 
increases on average which will be the tiniest in 12 years come 1999. 
They are calculated every year at this time pegged to inflation. And 
inflation is nearly stagnant at 1.3%. the rate changes take effect 
in January. The cost-of-living adjustment means the average check 
goes from $770 a month to $780. For those 6.6 million supplemental 
security income recipients, the raise amounts to about $6 a month 
for the people now getting the $500 maximum. The big picture -- the 
politics of saving social security for the next generation worries 
the president. In spite of the efforts of the majority, particularly 
in the House of Representatives, to squander the surplus on election 
year tax plans, we are still now well positioned to save social security. 
Although we can take justifiable pride in these accomplishments, let's 
not make any mistakes here. Eight days of progress cannot totally 
erase eight days of partisanship. Many seniors in Florida are upset 
at the raise saying 1.3% cannot begin to cover the increases in rent 
and food. One said officials should be ashamed of themselves for not 
sharing the budget surplus with those needing help.
