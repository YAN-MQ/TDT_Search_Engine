Americans are hearing less of that sound, as they turn off their faucets 
and conserve water in their homes. According to a report released 
by the United States Geological Survey: despite a growth in population, 
Americans are using less water. Down two percent from 1990. And down 
nearly 10 percent from 1980. Public conservation programs have helped 
reduce the numbers. But also major water consumers in agriculture 
and industry are running their operations more efficiently and effectively. 
Wayne Solley is the manager of the National Water Use Information 
Program for the USGS and lead author of the report. He says while 
the news is good, attention must still be paid to the management of 
U.S. water resources. While there's still major concerns for leaving 
water in the streams for fish and wildlife. And for aesthetic purposes, 
for recreational use. So there's still an increased demand for good 
quality and clean water. The United States uses 1.5 trillion liters 
of water per day. And is the largest consumer in the world. In a state 
by state comparison: California, Texas, Illinois, and Florida account 
for the largest percentage of the total use in the country.
