Hello, everyone and welcome to Science World. I'm Brian Sislack. Next 
month's meteoroid shower is going to be a big show brought to you 
courtesy of Fifty Five, a comet that swings past our sun every 33 
years. As it passes within 1.2 million kilometers of earth, tiny chunks 
of debris will break off from the comet's tail. These Leonid meteoroids, 
so named because of their visual proximity to the constellation Leo 
will burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The result will be a brilliant 
light show for those on Earth's dark side. Beginning at roughly seven 
hours forty three Universal Time on November 17th. But space people 
are not happy. At the International Astronomical Federation Meeting 
at Melbourne, Australia, experts say the incoming velocity of these 
meteoroids will be roughly 70 km per second. So, a meteoroid one sixth 
of a millimeter in diameter could puncture a spacecraft with the impact 
of a 22 caliber bullet. NASA, the US space agency, will have no shuttle 
missions in orbit during that period. The Russian Cosmonauts on Mir 
will ride out the storm in their Souyez re-entry capsule. Experts 
say the odds of any serious damage to spacecraft are not great, but 
those satellites that can will be turning their sensors away from 
the storm just to be safe.
