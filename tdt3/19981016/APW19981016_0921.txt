A judge on Friday postponed a release order for 30 young elephants 
from a wildlife export farm, where animal welfare officials say they 
are being badly treated. Judge Herman Glas set Tuesday for an on-site 
inspection that will include two elephant experts from Kenya _ Daphne 
Sheldrick and Joyce Poole _ to examine the elephants and their enclosure. 
The owner of the animals, African Game Services, told the court on 
Friday that the elephants would die if they were moved, according 
to Rick Allan of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals. ``That's why we're (bringing) our own experts, to get 
here and make a decision,'' said Allan. ``The elephants have been 
traumatized.'' Earlier this week, Glas ruled in favor of Allan, who 
said the elephants' feet were tethered and chained when he inspected 
the farm in August. Since their capture along the Limpopo River in 
neighboring Botswana in August, the 5- to 10-year-old elephants were 
being tamed so they could be sold to zoos and safari parks. International 
wildlife organizations have been lobbying for their release.
