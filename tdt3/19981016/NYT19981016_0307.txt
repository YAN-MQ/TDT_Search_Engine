Joe DiMaggio is being treated for pneumonia in a hospital near his 
home in Florida. The Hall of Fame center fielder, who will turn 84 
next month, has been a patient in the Hollywood Memorial Hospital 
near Miami since Oct. 5 and was expected to be released next week, 
perhaps as early as Monday. ``He's had pneumonia for three months,'' 
his lawyer and confidant, Morris Engelberg, said Friday. ``He walked 
around with it for a couple of months. He couldn't knock it out. But 
he should be out this coming Monday.'' DiMaggio, who has been using 
a heart regulator for several years, has suffered from pneumonia in 
the past. Engelberg said that fluid had been drained from DiMaggio's 
lungs this week and that DiMaggio would not be able to attend the 
opening game of the World Series at Yankee Stadium on Saturday night. 
``You can't fly on pneumonia,'' Engelberg said, ``so he's got to stop 
flying for two or three weeks.'' DiMaggio has appeared at Yankee Stadium 
in recent years to throw out the ceremonial first ball. The commissioner's 
office has announced that the first pitch will be thrown by Sammy 
Sosa of the Chicago Cubs. DiMaggio appeared at Yankee Stadium on the 
final day of the season two weeks ago on Joe DiMaggio Day. He received 
a gift from George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner: duplicates 
of the eight diamond-studded World Series rings that were stolen from 
DiMaggio in 1960. DiMaggio played 13 seasons with the Yankees, starting 
in 1936 and ending in 1951, with three seasons missed when he served 
in the Army Air Force during World War II. He played in 11 All-Star 
Games and 10 World Series, and in 1941 DiMaggio set a major league 
record by hitting in 56 consecutive games. In 1969, the centennial 
year of baseball, he was voted the sport's greatest living player.
