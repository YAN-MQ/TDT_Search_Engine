African women must take advantage of technological and communications 
advances and respond to consumers' changing demands to claim a bigger 
stake in the global economy, a businesswoman said. ``If Africa women, 
who make up to 50 percent of 800 million African population, are not 
part of correctly chosen, properly executed partnerships, we are going 
to be left in the dust,'' Lucia Quachey, secretary-general of the 
African Women Entrepreneurs, said Thursday. Quachey spoke at the opening 
of a weeklong global trade fair and forum on African investment hosted 
by the Ethiopian government. The first such gathering was held in 
Ghana two years ago. At least 1,000 participants were expected to 
participate in a three-day discussion on investment opportunities 
in Africa starting Saturday.
