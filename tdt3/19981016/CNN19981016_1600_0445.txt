The New York businessman who offered Paula Jones $1 million to settle 
her sexual harassment suit against President Clinton is extending 
his deadline. Abe Hirschfield initially wanted an answer by noon today. 
Now, he says she can decide any time. Hirschfield has imposed a condition 
on his offer -- all the money must go to Jones and not her lawyers. 
His deal is separate from the $700,000 President Clinton's lawyers 
have offered to settle the case. Hirschfield says he wants to "end 
the haggling and move on."
