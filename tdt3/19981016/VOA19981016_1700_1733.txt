It's time to talk about frequencies. And we don't have a lot of frequency 
information, so it won't take long. But, if you're listening to us 
in Oceani or the Pacific. You can consider switching over right now 
to 9.705 MHz short-wave. Which we're now broadcasting on from 21 hours 
to 0 hour, Universal time. You know, these frequencies can be confusing. 
If you would like a schedule, write to us. Give us your name and address. 
And send it off to VOA NEWS NOW, The Voice of America, Washington 
D.C., 20547, USA. Or you can email us your name and address. Our email 
address is Newsnow@voa.gov. And in this case, newsnow is one word. 
So stay with us as VOA NEWS NOW continues. It's 21 hours 30, Universal 
time. And this is VOA NEWS NOW. NATO ambassadors extend by 10 days, 
the deadline for Yugoslavia to withdraw forces from Kosovo or face 
Alliance air strikes. Two men, on opposite sides of the political 
divide in Northern Ireland, have won the Nobel Peace Prize for their 
efforts to bridge that gap. On Dateline, we'll find some businesses 
are better off being smaller. All that, and more in our next half 
hour of VOA NEWS NOW.
