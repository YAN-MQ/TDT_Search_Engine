Here some highlights from a deal signed Friday between OSCE and the 
Yugoslav government on the deployment of the 2,000 foreign ``verifiers'' 
in Kosovo, as translated from Serbian by The Associated Press. -- 
The Yugoslav government guarantees all mission members full security 
... and will allow and cooperate in the evacuation of mission members 
in a state of emergency, should such a circumstance arise. -- The 
Yugoslav government will appoint liaison officers to work with the 
mission. -- The OSCE verifiers mission has a mandate of one year. 
This period can be extended at the request of the OSCE chairman or 
the Yugoslav government. -- The mission will have complete freedom 
of movement and will travel throughout Kosovo. -- The mission will 
receive weekly reports from Yugoslav army and Serb police headquarters 
in reference to troop movement. Mission members may be invited to 
follow police in Kosovo... The verification mission may be invited 
or may request to accompany police units during their daily activities. 
-- The mission will search for roadblocks and barricades ... and will 
report on those and other such objects whose purpose is not traffic 
or crime control. Head of mission may demand the removal of road blocks. 
-- The mission will liaise with state bodies in connection to activities 
concerning border control ... The mission may at its own request or 
at the invitation of state bodies visit and follow border control 
units at their daily duties. -- Once a political solution for self-rule 
in Kosovo is reached ... the mission will help supervise the elections, 
help establish institutions in Kosovo and help with the development 
of Kosovo police forces. -- The unarmed, 2,000-strong mission will 
have its seat in Pristina but also a liaison office in Belgrade and 
substations in smaller towns, villages in the province. Each sub-station 
will coordinate with local authorities, including local leadership 
of major ethnic groups. -- The Yugoslav government will accept the 
verification mission as a diplomatic body, and treat it according 
to the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. -- The mission will 
submit its reports to the U.N. and to all organizations pertaining 
to the U.N. Security Council resolution 1199. -- The mission will 
assist the UNHCR, ICRC and other humanitarian organizations in facilitating 
the return of refugees.
