Israeli and Palestinian leaders continue a crucial summit near Washington 
today trying to break a long stalemate in the mid-east peace process. 
President Clinton held separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netayahu and Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat Thursday before 
departing the summit. U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright 
is standing to help mediate. The key issue is forging a security plant 
for Palestinians to fight terrorism in exchange for Israel giving 
up more West Bank land.
