For computer-owning families, the machines sometimes seem to fit Ogden 
Nash's description of martinis: ``One is too few. Two is too many. 
Three is never enough.'' Some families started out with one computer. 
Fast when it was bought, it became ``slow'' when the newer models 
were brought out. So it sits on one desk, probably used for less demanding 
tasks, and the family's new one sits on another. And, to use another 
famous line, ``Never the twain shall meet.'' For most uses, that's 
fine. When the need arises, the files from one computer can be put 
on a floppy disk and taken to the other _ unless it's a file of a 
photograph that is too large to store on a floppy. If both machines 
have a Zip, or similar drive with high capacity, the ``sneakernet'' 
transfer system can still work. But things can become more complex. 
Say both computer users want on the Internet _ at the same time. The 
additional expense of bringing in another phone line can be expensive 
for installation and continuing for a monthly fee. The time to network 
has arrived. Hooking up two computers isn't as complicated as it used 
to be. If you have Macs, the machines were designed to be linked easily. 
In most households with two PCs, the two are probably running some 
version of Windows. In the past year or so, networking computers has 
become easier, thanks mainly to kits that direct home users toward 
the goal. Costs vary, depending on the system used and whether you 
or a computer store does the work. Plugging in two network cards and 
running a cable between them is the quick and cheap way to do it yourself 
and costs less than $100 for the network cards. Other methods can 
start driving up the costs. Lugging the two computers to a computer 
store and having technicians do the work is an option, although the 
labor cost is a factor to consider. Once connected, two computers 
can share hard drives. One printer can work for both computers. A 
scanner on one computer can capture images that can be transferred 
to the second computer. If the computers are in the same room, the 
job will be less daunting. If not, you may have to venture into the 
attic to run wires or drill through a wall to install a telephone-like 
receptacle to make the passthrough to the next room. However, some 
companies offer systems that work over a home's electrical wiring. 
Particularly intriguing is a simple hookup from a company that uses 
a wireless system that plugs into the printer ports of the computers 
and can thus connect two computers located up to 125 feet apart. I 
haven't tried the Aviator Wireless Network yet, but will be testing 
it shortly. While it's possible for the piggyback computer to use 
the Internet as long as the main computer is online, not all Internet 
service providers _ including AOL _ allow two screen names to be logged 
on at the same time under the same account. The October issue of Family 
PC magazine answers 20 questions about home networking. It explains 
the alternatives and lists the advantages (which I've touched on here.) 
The magazine also has an article on seven ways to upgrade an existing 
computer, how to surf the 'net with children, and sites to make Halloween 
even more spooky: www.unversalstudios.com/horror for instance. The 
magazine also has an Internet site: www.familypc.com. (Lonnie Brown
