The Israeli and Palestinian leaders and their negotiators are in the 
second day of a summit in the United States. Trying to break a long 
stalemate in the MidEast Peace Process. U.S. State Department spokesman, 
James Rubin, said he hoped the summit will encourage a dialog that 
will lead to further progress toward peace. Let's remember that prior 
to Secretary Albright's meeting with the two leaders in New York, 
and the President's subsequent meeting the next day. There hadn't 
been a meeting between the two leaders in 11 or so months. And now, 
we've not only increased the frequency, but turned it into something 
that's more normal. Something that one hopes will make each leader 
understand the needs and constraints and concerns of the other. So 
that practical solutions can be found to very real problems. The summit 
is being held under a virtual news blackout at a secluded retreat 
near Washington. The key issue is forging a security plan for Palestinians 
to fight terrorism, in exchange for Israel giving up more West Bank 
land.
