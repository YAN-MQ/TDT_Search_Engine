An aide to the speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament was shot 
in the head by an unidentified gunman outside his apartment building 
in St. Petersburg on Friday, Russian news agencies reported. Mikhail 
Osherov, aide to Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the State Duma, 
was in serious condition at the emergency unit of a local hospital. 
The attacker left behind a gun with a silencer, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency reported. Earlier this week, prominent St. Petersburg businessman 
Dmitry Filippov died from injuries he sustained in a bomb explosion. 
Filipov also had been close to Seleznyov, ITAR-Tass said. Seleznyov 
was expected to arrive in St. Petersburg later Friday for a meeting 
with lawmakers from other former Soviet republics. Many Russian businessmen 
acquired credentials as legislative aides in hopes that would help 
advance their business interests, and many have fallen victim to contract 
murders. There was no immediate word on whether Osherov had any business 
connections. Seleznyov spokesman Mikhail Belyat said he did not rule 
out a political motive behind the attack, adding that Osherov was 
expected to work as Seleznyov's campaign aide for the 1999 parliamentary 
elections, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
