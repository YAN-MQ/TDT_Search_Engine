On the economic front -- inflation is virtually nonexistent. Consumer 
prices were unchanged last month. Falling energy, clothing and vegetable 
prices helping keep inflation in check. Excluding food and energy 
costs, the core rate rose two-tenths of a percent. So far this year, 
consumer prices rose just 1.4%. so far this year separately, the nation's 
industrial output dropped unexpectedly in September -- down three-tenths 
of one percent. That's the weakest in 7 1/2 years.
