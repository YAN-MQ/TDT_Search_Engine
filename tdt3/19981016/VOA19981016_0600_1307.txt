US Open Tennis Champion, Patrick Rafter has reached the quarter finals 
of the CA Trophy Tournament in Vienna, Austria. Rafter had little 
difficulty in his 6-3, 6-2 win over Sweden's Magnus Norman. Fourth 
seed, Peter Courda of the Czech Republic was an upset victim losing 
to American Todd Martin 6-3, 7-6. Britain's Greg Rezesky scored a 
straight sets win over veteran Thomas Muster of Austria. That's sports. 
I'm Jim Stevenson.
