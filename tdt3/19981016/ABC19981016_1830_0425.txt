Overseas, NAto extended the deadline for the Serbs to get out of Kosovo. 
It's been five days since the Serbs agreed to withdraw forces from 
Kosovo, stop the violence against ethnic Albanians. Now they have 
even more time, even though NATO admits the Serbs are already not 
fulfilling their promises. ABC's Mike Lee is in Kosovo tonight. These 
Serb police were packing and leaving. But earlier, on the same road, 
several hundred other police had already arrived to take their place. 
At times it's a revolving door, that allows the Serbs to say their 
forces are withdrawing. U.S. intelligence sources say Serb anti-aircraft 
missile batteries remain active in Kosovo. They are supposed to be 
moved or turned off. Part of the problem here is that NAto has not 
said exactly how many police the Serbs are allowed to keep in Kosovo. 
As for the people who this agreement was meant to help, many say it 
hasn't changed a thing. 23-year-old refadie nuha feels betrayed that 
the U.S. did not smash the Serbs militarily. "The Serbs are claiming 
they have withdrawn," she says, "but last night we were running for 
cover because they were firing shells at us." U.N. aid workers are 
also worried that the agreement may not work. So they are rushing 
emergency food and other supplies to the refugees to keep them alive. 
This is a race against time. Winter rains and snow will soon make 
the roads here too muddy for relief trucks to reach mountain villages. 
If there's not a solution to that within the next three to four weeks, 
we will see another catastrophe. People dying in the field? Oh, yeah. 
Freezing to death? Yeah. There are tens of thousands of people at 
risk and still afraid to go home. And now, there are no NATO air strikes 
expected any time soon. Mike Lee, ABC News, Kosovo.
