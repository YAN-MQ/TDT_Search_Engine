Second seed Gorne Bonisovich of Croatia has been eliminated from the 
Singapore Open Tennis Tournament by Australian Mark Woodferd. Woodferd 
unseated at the tournament, bounced Bonisovich in straight sets, 6-4, 
7-6. Also making an early exit from the event from 6th seated, Mikhail 
Tilstrom of Sweden, a three sets loser to American Jim Courrier. David 
Lutty has details of Courrier's win from Singapore. As the seats tumbled, 
first Michael Chang then Gorne Bonisovich to Australian Mark Woodferd, 
Courrier four times a grand slam winner knocked out the sixth seat 
Sweden's Michael Tilstron seven points to three in the final set tie-break 
to win 6-4, 2-6, 7-6. This was a major confidence boost for Courrier 
back after injury. He aims to follow the path of Andre Agassi, backings 
of the world's top ten. Courrier now faces another American, Jan Michael 
Gambel for placing the semis for this Heineken Open. Oh, we've practiced 
quite a lot together. We played doubles this week together and - and, 
uh, practiced a lot more with him. So, I'm a lot more familiar with 
his game and - and, uh, and I won't be uh surprised if he's playing 
well. David Lutty for VOA in Singapore.
