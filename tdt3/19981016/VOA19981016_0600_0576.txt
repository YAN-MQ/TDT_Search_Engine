In Sierra Leon, Wednesday was the deadline for illegal foreign workers 
to register with immigration authorities. The Sierra Leonian government 
cracked down on illegal immigration earlier this month saying the 
illegal workers were contributing to the countries high unemployment 
rate. VOA's John Pittman reports from our West Africa Bureau. Immigration 
offices in Sierra Leon's capital Freetown were packed on Wednesday 
and Thursday as workers applied for new work permits. Last week, the 
government warned that anyone caught working in Sierra Leon after 
October 14th would be deported. The government said it would also 
shut down any business who's owner does not have proper working papers. 
Many of Sierra Leon's businesses are owned and operated by foreigners 
from Lebanon, South Asia, China, and other West African countries. 
News reports from Freetown say most of those lining up for new work 
permits this week have been Lebanese and South Asian merchants. Government 
estimate say Lebanese ex-patriots make up Sierra Leon's largest immigrant 
community, currently about ten thousand Lebanese citizens live in 
Sierra Leon. But, that down from a high around fifteen thousand before 
the 1997 military coup which ousted President Ashman Kahan Kabal from 
office. Most of Sierra Leon's foreign community fled the country during 
the coup, but some who stayed behind were accused of collaborating 
with the coup leaders. More than twenty Lebanese diamond merchants 
have been deported since President Kabal was restored to power earlier 
this year. The government has accused foreign diamond exporters of 
helping the coup leaders earn money abroad, money which was used to 
buy weapons. The crack down has raised concerns that the government 
may be trying to punish other foreigners who collaborated with the 
Junta. For it's part, the government says that it has not singled 
out any specific nationality for special attention. It says the crack 
down is simply an effort to curb unemployment. The government says 
in addition to the registration effort, it will also begin enforcing 
immigration laws which were previously ignored. John Pittman, VOA 
News, West Africa Bureau.
