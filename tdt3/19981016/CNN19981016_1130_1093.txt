Here's a tall tale -- Donald trump is planning to build the highest 
apartment building in the world in New York City. The 90-story tower 
would be built across from the United Nations and unit prices would 
be in the $1 million range. The project, of course, must pass through 
a maze of hurdles, including government regulations and doubts about 
financing. Still, the Donald hopes to complete the $360 million dollar 
project by the year 2001.
