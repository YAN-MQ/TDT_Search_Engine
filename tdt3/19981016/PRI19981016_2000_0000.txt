TONY CAHN, VOA CORRESPONDENT From Public Radio International, this 
is "The World," a co- production of the BBC World Service, PRI and 
WGBH Boston. It's Friday, October 16th. I'm Tony Cahn. Today, Northern 
Ireland's peacemakers win the Nobel Prize and Australia's changing 
population involves a new sense of national identity. It will be there. 
It will emerge quite clearly, I would say, in 50 years' time. It is 
unstoppable. Also, an English city finds inspiration and shame in 
its historical roots and Cubanismo finds inspiration and rhythm in 
Cuban's musical roots. Who would be believe that at the end of the 
century, we'll want to be playing the music that was created in the 
beginning. First, this news.
