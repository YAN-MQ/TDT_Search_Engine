First, it may be less expensive to finance a home or car. Thursday, 
the federal reserve lowered two key interest rates. One was the federal 
funds rate, which could lead to lower rates for things like credit 
cards and auto loans. Lower rates also mean it's easier for businesses 
to borrow money. It's the second, quarter-point drop in a month, and 
an apparent attempt to keep the world economic crisis from causing 
a recession in the United States. Wall Street celebrated with a 330 
point rally. It's the third biggest point gain, ever. We'll have more 
on the impact of the interest rate cut in "Dollars & Sense" at 46 
past the hour.
