Officers fired warning shots when protesters attacked a police station 
after mistaking three out-of-town detectives as suspects in a bizarre 
murder spree case, police and news reports said Friday. Three people 
were hospitalized with gunshot wounds, The Surabaya Post newspaper 
reported. Six people were arrested during Wednesday night's attack 
on the station at Semampir, just outside of Indonesia's second most 
populous city, Surabaya. Witnesses said police fired a volley of shots 
above the mob as it forced its way into the station, apparently wanting 
to lynch those they had mistaken as suspects in the mysterious killings 
of Muslim clergy and alleged sorcerers. The daily Kompas reported 
that six policemen were injured by the stone-throwing mob. ``It was 
merely a misunderstanding,'' said an officer at the badly damaged 
station. He spoke on condition of anonymity and gave no further details. 
However, East Java police spokesman Lt. Col. Sutrisno denied anyone 
was hurt. Surabaya, about 400 miles (650 kilometers) east of Jakarta, 
is the capital of East Java province, where more than 100 people have 
been murdered. During recent months, parts of main island of Java 
been terrorized by the slayings of at least 153 people by masked killers 
dressed in black. Police have said the killers strike at night, cutting 
their victims throats and sometimes hanging mutilated bodies in trees 
or tossing them in the street. Most of the victims were Muslim preachers 
or had been accused of dabbling in black magic. Police say they have 
yet to establish a clear motive for the killings.
