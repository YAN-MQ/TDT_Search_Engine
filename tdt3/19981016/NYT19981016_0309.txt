Gabe Doppelt was scrambling. As VH-1's creative director of fashion, 
Ms. Doppelt is a producer of the cable music channel's annual Fashion 
Awards, and each year she commissions designers to create outfits 
around a rock-related theme for the show's opening. But she admits, 
``Every year I look for the appropriate collision of fashion and music, 
and I never really find it.'' This year promised to be no different, 
until Ms. Doppelt heard that a movie about the glam rock movement 
had won an award at the Cannes Film Festival, and her antennae began 
buzzing. Todd Haynes' ``Velvet Goldmine'' is a fictionalized re-creation 
of the early 1970s British rock scene, when, in reaction to frumpy 
hippiedom, T. Rex's lead singer, Marc Bolan, started wearing glitter 
and women's clothes, and former folkie David Bowie decked himself 
out as the sexually ambiguous spaceman Ziggy Stardust. For a brief, 
shining moment, men wore eye shadow, feather boas, platform shoes 
and the tightest outfits the era's fabrics allowed. Ms. Doppelt, who 
as a teen-ager in England had once worn a Bolan-inspired leopard-print 
catsuit, called Miramax, the distributor of ``Velvet Goldmine,'' to 
screen the movie. Seeing the eye-catching period costumes designed 
by Sandy Powell, she knew she'd found her motif. She sent ``Velvet 
Goldmine'' stills and vintage '70s videos to designers she thought 
would respond, including Tom Ford, Michael Kors, John Galliano and 
Anna Sui. They not only delivered fanciful concoctions to VH-1, which 
will telecast its awards show Oct. 27, but some of them also carried 
the theme into their own work. Ms. Sui got so excited that when she 
sat down to design her spring 1999 collection (which will be presented 
Nov. 4), she plastered her studio walls with images of the film's 
co-stars, Ewan MacGregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (who play fictionalized 
versions of Iggy Pop and Bowie), while blasting songs like T. Rex's 
``20th Century Boy.'' ``The movie captured that whole excitement when 
there's something going on, rules to be broken,'' Ms. Sui said. ``That 
hasn't happened for the longest time.'' Now, as myriad glam influences 
seem to be percolating back into pop culture in music, theater and 
fashion, the question arises whether this trend is the expression 
of an authentic, grass-roots revival _ or a fabrication of the buzz 
machine. On the cover of its latest issue, W magazine announces an 
article about ``Velvet Goldmine'' with the proclamation ``The Return 
of Glam.'' Vogue's latest issue makes the bold, if ambiguous, claim, 
``If `Velvet Goldmine' doesn't turn out to be the IT movie of 1998, 
it will be odd.'' The hunger for something new is so strong that when 
Ford introduced some flower prints, beads, ruffles and tight leather 
jackets at Gucci's Milan show two weeks ago, Women's Wear Daily proclaimed 
``Glam Slam!'' on its cover, and added, ``The fashion movement everyone 
has been waiting for finally exploded.'' Is it real or is it spandex? 
Is glam due to be the next big moment on the streets and over the 
airwaves, or is it a flash in the pan, a media-propelled bandwagon 
set in motion by a movie distributor? Surely, more must be required 
to start a worldwide style sensation than one nostalgic cable television 
producer's screening an art-house movie about a short-lived subculture. 
But perhaps not that much more. The pop-culture recycling machine 
has already disinterred the goofier looks of the '70s; why not the 
most ultra-fabulous one? Most filmmakers would kill to make the kind 
of waves ``Velvet Goldmine'' has made even before it opens (it comes 
to theaters Nov. 6), and Miramax is exploiting the ``return of glam'' 
angle for all it's worth. But the makers of the movie _ which is, 
after all, an art-house fantasia with a bisexual leading character, 
not ``Saturday Night Fever'' _ seem somewhat baffled by the brewing 
phenomenon. Informed of W's cover proclamation, Ms. Powell, who was 
previously nominated for Academy Awards for the costumes for ``Wings 
of the Dove,'' started laughing. ``Gosh, really?'' she said. ``To 
me, it doesn't feel like it. People are used to wearing more comfortable 
clothing.'' Platforms for men? ``I don't think it's gonna happen,'' 
she said. One of the movie's executive producers is Michael Stipe, 
the lead singer for R.E.M., who has worn dresses onstage. He understands 
glam's appeal. ``Clothes haven't been fun for a while,'' he said. 
``Especially right now. You walk into the stores, and everything is 
very flat and very gray. And glam is a nice respite from that kind 
of accepted dullness.'' But he doesn't think ``Velvet Goldmine'' is 
going to do for spangles what ``American Graffiti'' did for white 
T-shirts. ``I don't think the glam equivalent of poodle skirts is 
going to be the look, or should be,'' Stipe said. ``It would be silly 
and redundant.'' Before too much sanctimony sets in about a hype-driven 
return of glam, it is fitting to recall that the original movement 
was self-conscious and artificial to begin with. ``It was all about 
role-playing, artifice and escapism,'' said Craig Wedren, the lead 
singer of Shudder to Think, who wrote and performed two Bowie-like 
songs for the soundtrack of ``Velvet Goldmine.'' A similar view inspired 
Haynes, the writer and director of ``Velvet Goldmine,'' which implies 
that Bowie concocted the whole glam movement as a marketing ploy. 
``Rock has always been so much about `authenticity,' and consecutive 
generations are always dueling about who's more `real''' Haynes said. 
``But ultimately rock is a mass-media enterprise, funneled through 
modes of production, and I don't know what stays absolutely `real' 
in that process.'' ``Glam artists were already several steps ahead 
of that by acknowledging the fake-ness from the start _ celebrating 
it, enjoying it and being ironic about it as well,'' he said. ``Velvet 
Goldmine'' crudely echoes the structure of ``Citizen Kane,'' as a 
reporter (Christian Bale) reconstructs, through interviews and flashbacks, 
the story of Brian Slade, a bisexual, Bowie-esque figure played by 
Rhys Meyers. Much of the story hews closely to events in Bowie's life, 
including the early influence of Angie Bowie, his wife at the time. 
Other aspects are more impressionistic _ the Ewan McGregor character 
is part Lou Reed, part Iggy Pop, and looks a lot like Kurt Cobain. 
The original glam scene was born, Barney Hoskyns says in his new book, 
``Glam! Bowie, Bolan and the Glitter Rock Revolution'' (Pocket Books), 
at a show Bowie did in London in February 1970. He wore a glittery 
``Rainbowman'' costume and blue hair. The audience mostly booed him 
off the stage (a moment recreated in ``Velvet Goldmine''), but Bolan 
was watching from the sidelines, and absorbed the influence. Bowie 
assembled a look and sound that drew on myriad sources: his experience 
in an avantgarde mime troupe, Andy Warhol's superstar-obsessed Factory, 
Weimer-era German cabaret and Stanley Kubrick's ``Clockwork Orange.'' 
The glam torch was also picked up by Brian Eno and Bryan Ferry of 
Roxy Music and, in the United States, by the New York Dolls. Musically, 
glam has never really gone away; it just mutated. There have been 
strains of it in everything from Elton John to early MTV stars like 
Adam Ant and Duran Duran; in the heavy metal ``hair bands'' of the 
'80s, and in the recent bevy of doomed-romantic English bands like 
Pulp, Suede and Blur. But as an influence on wardrobes and attitudes, 
glam has long since been supplanted by punk, grunge and, most recently, 
late-'70s disco. ``The funny thing is,'' Haynes said, ``glam never 
had that much power in the United States to begin with, so there's 
very few people I know here who feel they went through it the first 
time.'' Even Haynes himself, 37, although a fan of the music in his 
youth, came to it too late to dress the part. When writing the screenplay, 
he dyed his hair red and wore tight, midriff-baring clothes and platform 
shoes. By the time filming began, he abandoned the look. ``There's 
so much upkeep,'' he said. ``Major high-maintenance hair.'' Given 
all that, it seems improbable that glam styles would return now. Nonetheless, 
there have been rumblings of a reawakening quite separate from ``Velvet 
Goldmine.'' The past year has seen the successes of the Off Broadway 
glam musical ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' and Eddie Izzard, the comedian 
who wears makeup and dresses. ( Haynes cast him as the Bowie character's 
manager in ``Velvet Goldmine.'') More surprising still has been the 
return of Kiss, the heavily made-up rock band. And most tellingly, 
rock's reigning image manipulator, Marilyn Manson, recently made himself 
over from Goth to glam, complete with Bowie-inspired red hair and 
spaceman wardrobe. He even released a cover of Bowie's ``Golden Years.'' 
Seventh Avenue's embrace of glam comes, as usual, with a mixture of 
inspiration and exploitation. Before and after his Milan show, Ford 
of Gucci cited a range of glam-like influences _ Las Vegas, biker 
girls, Cher _ without specifically naming glam rock. Ms. Sui, who 
has shown traces of glam for years, in nearly every collection, is 
making allowances this time for the fuller bodies of aging boomer 
customers, who find themselves no longer as twig-thin as when they 
first embraced glam rock. ``You have the benefit of technology _ Lycra 
is stretchy,'' she said. ``It won't fall apart after you wear it a 
couple of times.'' For her part, Ms. Doppelt of VH-1 doesn't envision 
the trend, which she helped to fan, taking hold in the malls of America. 
``I don't think it's for everybody,'' she said. As a cultural revolution, 
it's been rendered completely empty in her view. ``I never look for 
deep meanings in anything when it comes to fashion and music,'' she 
said. ``It's just kids dressing up. And I don't think kids will get 
into glam _ the extra-wide-pants movement is much stronger than glam 
rock.'' Norma Kamali, who sold half of her women's clothes in the 
early '70s to men, recalls the era as ``a time when no one had inhibitions 
about anything, and it was very creative as a result.'' In the current 
fashion climate, she added, ``if somebody does express themselves 
individually, they almost look like they need to be medicated or institutionalized.'' 
One of the men who used to wear Kamali is David Johansen, formerly 
of the New York Dolls. ``We were just trying to be anti-denim, to 
put a little pizazz back into it,'' Johansen recalled. ``It's an old 
tradition. It goes back to, like, Mozart and Little Richard. Every 
generation is going to want to do it _ for certain artistic people, 
it's part of the process of exploration.'' Johansen, 48, now wears 
dinner jackets and croons Spanish music in the persona of an alter 
ego, Buster Poindexter. ``To today's scene, I'm like Peter Sellers 
in `I Love You, Alice B. Toklas,''' he said, referring to the uptight, 
aging lawyer who tries to be a hippie in the movie. If there is one 
verity about a flirtation with glam _ either by an individual or an 
entire culture _ it is that the style is so extreme that any embrace 
of it will quickly pass, like other youthful indulgences. ``Sometimes 
I look at Kiss,'' Johansen said, ``and think, `There but for the grace 
of God go I.' ''
