The federal spending Bill is all but signed and sealed, and it will 
remain that way at least until Monday. Congressional leaders have 
delayed a final vote on the $500 billion plan until next week. They 
had hoped to vote on it today. Lawmakers from both parties are anxious 
to get home and start campaigning for the November elections. But 
they still have a few fine points to debate and some numbers to compute. 
Despite the delay, members of both parties are claiming victory. Because 
you made a stand, Mr. president, and democrats stood together in the 
end, this Congress did put social security first. When republicans 
wanted to raid social security to pay for an election year tax scheme, 
we stopped them. On every one of these measures, education, economic 
leadership, agriculture, social security, republicans fought us, but 
in the end, democrats would not be defeated. And working families 
all across this country this morning are the winners. Congress will 
pass yet another short-term spending Bill to keep the government open 
for a few more days.
