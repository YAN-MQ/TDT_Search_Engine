Finally, it seems that as people, especially men, reach middle age, 
their snoring can get louder and more pronounced. This is especially 
true if the person smokes, is over weight or consumes alcohol shortly 
before bedtime. But a study of over 2,600 Swedish men shows that somewhere 
between the ages of 50 and 60, the snoring actually decreases. Writing 
in the Journal "Chest" of the American College of Chest Physicians, 
Dr. Ava Lenburg of Upsala University in Sweden, said the snoring is 
most pronounced during the so called slow wave sleep, referring to 
the frequency of the sleeper's brain waves. As people get older, slow 
waves sleep, as a proportion of total sleep decreases, and so, therefore, 
does the snoring. So, there are advantages of getting old.
