The United Nations Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, has expressed concern 
over the rising number of Somali and Ethiopian asylum seekers who 
have died at sea while trying to reach Yemen. Lisa Schlein reports 
from Geneva. Since the beginning of the year, the U.N. Refugee Agency 
reports nearly 250 asylum seekers on the way to Yemen, are known to 
have died at sea. However, it believes many more deaths have gone 
unrecorded. In September and October alone, the Agency says 27 Somalian 
Ethiopian asylum seekers are known to have drowned. UNHCR spokeswoman, 
Judith Cumin says more than 94 hundred boat people have arrived in 
Yemen this year. These boat people are using mostly armed smugglers 
to bring them to Yemen. This frequently results in exchanges of fire 
between the smugglers and the Yemeni Coast Guards. And casualties, 
of course. To avoid being apprehended by the Yemeni Coast Guard, Ms. 
Cumin says the smugglers usually drop the human cargo overboard before 
they reach shore. She says, those who can't swim, drown. Lisa Schlein, 
for VOA NEWS, Geneva.
