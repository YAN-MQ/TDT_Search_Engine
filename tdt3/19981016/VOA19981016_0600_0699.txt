The Mexican Foreign Ministry says abuses of immigrants by US Immigration 
officials are on the rise. So far, this year, one hundred fifteen 
Mexicans have died trying to cross illegally into the United States. 
VOA's Greg Flakus has more from Mexico City. In a report issued by 
the Mexican Foreign Ministry, Mexican officials say that reported 
cases of abuse against immigrants increased by 50 percent last year 
and that the total for this year could be higher still. Among the 
specific abuses sited for 1997 are 47 deaths, five cases of severe 
injury and 33 cases in which US authorities allegedly beat immigrants. 
The same report indicates that the number of deaths on the border 
has also increased over previous years. According to the Mexican figures, 
up to August 7th of this year, 115 immigrants died in attempts to 
cross the border and another 469 were close to death as the result 
of dangerous water crossings, climatic conditions or other risks encountered 
in the effort to reach safety on the US side of the line. The foreign 
ministry says that Mexico's 42 conciliates in the United States are 
intensifying their efforts to protect the human rights of Mexican 
citizens migrating to the United States in search of work. U.S. Border 
Patrol Spokesman denied that there have been wide-spread abuse of 
immigrants and blamed the deaths on immigrant smugglers who charge 
over a thousand dollars in many cases to take someone across the frontier. 
The border patrol says these smugglers often leave their clients stranded 
in high mountains or dry desert areas where their lives are at risk.
