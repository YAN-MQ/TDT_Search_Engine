The house and the Senate are putting off a final vote on the $500 
billion federal budget Bill until Tuesday. The massive spending measure 
was produced yesterday after a week of intense negotiations between 
Congress and the White House. Congressional aides say the delay will 
allow the agreement to but put in writing and give lawmakers a chance 
examine it. Republicans and democrats disagree about who should get 
credit for the deal, but agree it is a victory for Americans. Because 
you made a stand, Mr. president and democrats stood together in the 
end, this Congress did put social security first. When republicans 
wanted to raise social security to pay for in an election-year tax 
scheme, we stopped them. With everyone of these measures -- education, 
economy, leadership, agriculture, social security -- republicans fought 
us. But in the end, democrats would not be defeated, and working families 
all across this countries are the winners. We now have, thanks to 
the work of this Congress, a $70 billion budget surplus. We have preserved 
the integrity of this against the demands to spend it by the president, 
and we will have that $50 billion next year to begin the process of 
restoring retirement security in America and cutting taxes significantly 
for the American people. Lawmakers are expected to approve another 
stopgap measure today -- the fifth this month -- to keep the government 
running until Tuesday.
