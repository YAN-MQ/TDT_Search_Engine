An American compromise plan has been introduced at the Mideast summit 
to extend the interim period of peace talks between Israel and the 
Palestinians to January 1, 2001, Channel Two reported Friday. In exchange, 
the report said, Israel would agree in principal to accept a future 
Palestinian state. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would 
declare statehood unilaterally in May 1999, when the interim period 
of talks are due to end. At the summit at a secluded resort on Maryland's 
eastern shore, the Americans are prodding Arafat and Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu toward agreeing on a long-delayed Israeli pullback 
from part of the West Bank, part of a series of interim agreements 
signed by the two sides starting in 1993. Negotiations have been stalemated 
for a year and a half.
