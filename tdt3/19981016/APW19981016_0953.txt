Haunted by eight dead antelopes he is accused of hunting and killing, 
one of India's most loved movie stars suffered more embarrassment 
Friday with the discovery of three rare antelopes and a peacock caged 
in his father's farmhouse. Salman Khan, heartthrob of millions, was 
set for a tortuous trial as a court rejected his plea for bail in 
the western desert district of Jodhpur, where he being tried with 
two leading actors and three popular actresses for allegedly killing 
eight antelopes in two separate safaris _ between Sept. 26-28 and 
on Oct. 10. Some of the antelopes were cooked and eaten. The court 
found that Khan had pulled the trigger on both occasions. Hundreds 
of miles away near Bombay, investigators gave a sensational twist 
to the case when they raided the sprawling farmhouse of his father, 
script writer Salim Khan, and rescued a black buck, two chinkara deer 
and a peacock kept in an iron cage. One of the black bucks rescued 
in Bombay died while being transported back to a wildlife park, Friday's 
Mid-Day newspaper said. India's tough wildlife laws consider the forcible 
trapping of endangered animals as cruel as killing them. The charge 
of poaching endangered wild animals carries up to seven years in prison. 
``We have evidence enough for these actors' conviction,'' the state's 
top wildlife official Alka Kala said in a telephone interview from 
Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan state where Jodhpur is located. Salman 
Khan has been the heartthrob of many Indian women for almost a decade. 
He is seen as a Sylvester Stallone-type macho romantic who fights 
for love in gutwrenching action sequences. Another popular actor, 
Saif Ali Khan, and actresses Sonali Bendre, Tabu and Neelam have been 
granted bail in the killing case. Tabu and Neelam use only their first 
names. Forest officials have also accused actor Satish Shah, famous 
for his comic roles of colluding with Salman Khan. Members of the 
local Bishnoi tribe, who worship the endangered black bucks and chinkaras, 
alerted forest officials to the Oct. 10 killings in Jodhpur. The Bishnois 
said they heard gunshots and rushed to the site, where they found 
the actors with the dead animals. The movie stars quickly drove away 
with one black buck, tribe members said. Tribe members buried the 
other two animals. Salman Khan faced nearly a thousand angry protesters 
of the Bishnoi community when he entered the courthouse on Thursday, 
and several furious men said he would not have escaped unhurt from 
the preserve if he had been caught after the late night hunt. ``If 
we had laid our hands on Salman Khan that night, we wouldn't have 
left him well enough to work in films any more,'' one of them, Mohan 
Ram Bishnoi, was quoted as saying by The Pioneer newspaper. More than 
100 people _ including the person who drove off with a bleeding black 
buck and the chef who cooked it to the actors' specifications _ gave 
evidence against the film stars, officials said. The hunt apparently 
took place during a break from filming.
