It's been two decades now since the Catholic church elected its first 
nonitalian Pope in 455 years. Karol wojtyla, an archbishop from Poland, 
a man of many languages and talents. Former actor, an avid skier, 
a many clearly gifted with grace. Now John Paul II is celebrating 
his 20th anniversary in the papacy. NBC's Keith Miller will start 
us off. St. Pete ever's -- Peter's square was packed this morning 
for a mass celebrating John Paul's 20 years as Pope. It has been a 
week-long celebration within the Vatican. Inside the sistine chapel 
there was a concert to commemorate the anniversary. John Paul has 
been meeting -- leading the Roman Catholic church longer than any 
Pope this century. I think it's sufficiently historic to open wine 
for breakfast, celebration for great humility, incredible life, determination 
which moves him. At 78 years old he is moving slowly. Despite his 
frail appearance Vatican officials say the Pope is healthy. This month 
he visited Croatia his 84th foreign trip in 20 years. He is already 
planning to visit the United States next year. John Paul in 20 years 
has created more saints than any Pope in recent history and certainly 
met more sinners. I think he's changed at least for a time the notion 
of what a Pope is as far as the Catholic church is concerned. An Italian 
TV talk show discussing the Pope got an unexpected caller. John Paul 
phoned in to say thanks for thinking of him and then performed a minor 
miracle. He left a talk-show host speechless. Keith Miller, NBC news.
