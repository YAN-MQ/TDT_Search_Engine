Prosecutors turned over more than 1,200 pages of summation to a judge 
Friday, asking him to convict the brother of a former president of 
killing a political rival. The report asked the judge to sentence 
Raul Salinas de Gortari to the maximum allowed under Mexican law, 
50 years in prison, an official at the federal attorney general's 
office said on condition of anonymity. Salinas is charged with masterminding 
the assassination of ruling party Secretary-General Jose Francisco 
Ruiz Massieu in 1994, when Salinas' brother Carlos was president. 
The trial has lasted for 2 1/2 years, and testimony concluded in late 
August. Prosecution representative Miguel Angel Sanchez made no comment 
as he turned over three volumes of the prosecution's summation to 
the court in Toluca, 35 miles (55 kms) west of Mexico City. The three 
volumes contain more than 1,200 pages of conclusions and recommendations. 
Mexico City newspapers reported that prosecutors in the summation 
claimed that Raul Salinas' motives included the divorce of Ruiz Massieu 
and the Salinas' sister, Adriana, as well as power struggles over 
the food distribution agency that Raul Salinas headed. The defense 
now must present its own summation, and the judge will issue his ruling. 
Salinas was arrested in 1995, four months after his brother left office. 
He has been held since at the maximum-security Almoloya de Juarez 
prison 35 miles west of Mexico City, and has maintained his innocence. 
Raul Salinas also is on trial for illicit enrichment in another court, 
and prosecutors are considering charging him with money laundering 
and drug smuggling as well. And Swiss authorities are investigating 
him for depositing millions of dollars under false names while his 
younger brother was president. Swiss court documents cite U.S. officials 
alleging the accounts contain dlrs 132 million in drug-trafficking 
bribes. Salinas says the money was legitimate. Carlos Salinas, who 
served as president from 1988 to 1994, has been living in Ireland 
and does not face any charges.
