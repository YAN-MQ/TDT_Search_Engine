Baseball legend Joe DiMaggio is in the hospital being treated for 
pneumonia. The 83-year-old former Yankee hitter was the first choice 
of team owner George Steinbrenner to throw out the first pitch when 
the yanks start the world series tomorrow. A friend says he'll watch 
the game from his hospital bed. DiMaggio holds one of baseball's most 
enduring records -- a 56-game hitting streak set in 1941.
