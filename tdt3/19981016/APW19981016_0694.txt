Canadian Sebastian Reidl, hampered by a contaminated fuel tank and 
a broken mast boom, has become the first skipper to drop out of the 
43,450-kilometer (27,000-mile) Around Alone yachting race. Reidl, 
who raised money by charging people between dlrs 10 and dlrs 20 to 
put their names on the hull of his boat _ Project Amazon, radioed 
race officials Thursday he was heading to Puerto Rico. The sailors 
left Charleston last month headed for Cape Town, South Africa, their 
first stop. After a week at sea, water seeped into Project Amazon's 
diesel fuel tank leaving Reidl no power to run his communications 
equipment, stove and autopilot. ``What to do?'' he messaged a sponsor, 
ThinkWells Inc. ``No power, no autopilot, communication and no hot 
food. ... The whole boat smells like a diesel tank, and I smell like 
I had fallen into it.'' Reidl had no success filtering the water from 
the tank using toilet paper and paper towels. He did add rubbing alcohol 
to the fuel to separate the water and get the engine running well 
enough to generate some power, but he didn't have enough clean fuel 
to last to Cape Town. On Wednesday, the boom on his 26-meter (86-foot) 
front mast broke and he was unable to repair the damage. ``I decided 
that my arrival in Cape Town would be too late to repair my now existing 
deficiencies and be ready for the next leg of the race,'' Reidl radioed 
race headquarters. He is expected to arrive in Puerto Rico in 10 to 
12 days, said John Brooman, a spokesman for Reidl's Project Amazon 
campaign. Fifteen skippers are still racing.
