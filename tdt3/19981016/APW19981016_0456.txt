When John Glenn rockets into space again, the only living man to precede 
him into orbit will be watching longingly. ``He is lucky, very lucky,'' 
former Soviet cosmonaut German Titov said. ``It is an old spaceman's 
dream.'' Titov, 62, circled the earth 17 times during Aug. 6-7, 1961, 
six months ahead of Glenn's three-orbit flight. Now age 77, Glenn 
is training to return to space aboard a shuttle Oct. 29. On a recent 
visit to a Stockholm exhibit of memorabilia from the early years of 
the space race, Titov recalled the excitement and intense U.S.-U.S.S.R. 
rivalry of those days. ``In my opinion, we should always have been 
cooperating, from the very beginning,'' he said, gazing at a model 
Mir space station suspended from the exhibit hall's ceiling. ``I am 
very glad that is happening now.'' After two decades of viewing the 
other's achievements as potential military threats, the two countries 
in 1975 arranged the link-up of Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft in orbit. 
An American astronaut lived aboard Mir for 4 1/2 months in 1997. When 
the Soviet Union launched the satellite Sputnik in 1957, Titov was 
one of the millions worldwide who scanned the skies in hopes of seeing 
it. He recently had completed training as a fighter pilot. ``I never 
saw it,'' he said, and what's more, ``I was very skeptical'' that 
plans to send a man into space would ever be realized. Nevertheless, 
he enrolled in the first cosmonauts group in 1960, and had a front-row 
seat when Lt. Yuri Gagarin blasted off April 12, 1961, into space, 
history and public acclaim. For a long time, Titov brooded that he 
should have been chosen. But now he admits that Gagarin's good looks 
and vibrant personality were important ``right stuff'' ingredients. 
``Everything about Gagarin was suitable to be first,'' Titov said 
through a translator. ``After a while, we can see it was right. He 
was not only a Soviet cosmonaut. He was the world's first astronaut. 
He was right for that.'' Gagarin died in a plane crash in 1968. The 
first American in space, Alan Shepard, who went up 23 days after Gagarin, 
died this year. Like Glenn, now a senator representing Ohio, Titov 
eventually went into politics, becoming a member of the Russian parliament. 
He wishes the parallels would continue with a chance to go back into 
space himself. But though he looks fit and at age 62, is 15 years 
younger than Glenn, that won't happen, Titov said, because of Russia's 
political and economic turmoil. That doesn't stop him from dreaming 
about another chance to see Earth through a spaceship's window, a 
glowing blue orb amid the blackness. ``It's unforgettable,'' Titov 
said. ``It's like your first love _ impossible to forget. In a way, 
that is my only love.'' His wife, Tamara, was standing nearby, but 
gave no sign she had heard.
