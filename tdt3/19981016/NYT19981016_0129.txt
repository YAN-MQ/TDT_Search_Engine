Wednesday night, a double-A list of the friends and clients of Bertram 
Fields gathered at the ``21'' Club to offer congratulations. Another 
legal victory for the swashbuckling Hollywood attorney? Not exactly. 
This time, Fields, who has done legal battle on behalf of Tom Cruise, 
James Cameron, the Beatles and nearly every major film studio, was 
being feted for a scholarly book in defense of an altogether different 
client, Richard III. Among those who breezed in to pick up a free 
copy of ``Royal Blood: Richard III and the Mystery of the Princes'' 
(Regan Books/HarperCollins), which examines whether history unfairly 
blames Shakespeare's scheming hunchback for killing his two nephews, 
were Tina Brown, Mort Zuckerman and Lorne Michaels. Also Barry Diller, 
Charlie Rose, Nora Ephron and Elaine May. Everyone swore that Fields' 
tome _ his third book, following two steamy novels written under the 
pseudonym D. Kinkaid _ was bound for the top of a bedside reading 
pile. ``I was drip-fed Shakespeare at Oxford,'' said Ghislaine Maxwell, 
a daughter of the late media kingpin Robert Maxwell, as she stuck 
her nose into the book's binding. ``Just sniffing fresh ink gets me 
high.'' Fields, who is rather regal-looking himself, with a healthy 
West Coast glow, hovered by the mahogany bar, signing copies of the 
book. A woman who said she bought five copies waited anxiously as 
the author scribbled a warm salutation. Asked who she was after she 
departed, Fields said, ``Gee, I can't remember.'' Mario Puzo, sockless 
in a pair of tan Rockport loafers, sat in a corner of the top-floor 
private room, chewing an increasingly soggy, unlighted cigar. ``I 
don't want to offend anyone by lighting up,'' he said. ``In my day, 
you got a bunch of writers together and there would be at least one 
fist-fight.'' The only raised voice was that of Fields' publisher, 
Judith Regan, who vehemently criticized her absent husband, Robert 
Kleinschmidt. The two have been mired in divorce proceedings since 
1992. ``Next time we meet, it's going to be in criminal court, not 
civil court,'' she assured Dominick Dunne, who simply nodded. ``And 
believe me, I won't be so civil.'' Everyone said that, despite his 
reputation as an invincible legal bulldog, Fields is really a pussycat. 
``People have such a negative view of lawyers these days, but Bert 
is different,'' insisted Suzie Schuster, a producer at ESPN. ``He's 
not smarmy _ he's a swami.'' Fields said he wrote the book after his 
97-year-old father, who has never been impressed by his son's stunning 
legal prowess, groused, ``When are you going to do something serious 
with your life?'' The next day, Fields sat down to begin ``Royal Blood.'' 
Over a dinner at ``21,'' Fields told a story about placing pages of 
his hand-written manuscript on the roof of his car and driving off. 
When he got to work, several months of effort had vanished in the 
wind. His wife, Barbara Guggenheim, tried to find the lost pages by 
placing a soggy pile of newspapers on top of her car, retracing her 
husband's route and stopping when the newspapers took flight. She 
got the idea, she said, from the saga of Lorena Bobbitt, whose husband's 
severed penis was found using a similar method. ``The police drove 
around throwing hot dogs out the window,'' Ms. Guggenheim said, over 
a plate of roasted foie gras. ``Anyway, in the case of my husband, 
it didn't work.''
