Pro-British Protestant leader David Trimble and Moderate Irish Nationalist 
John Hume have won the Nobel Peace Prize for their tireless work to 
end thirty years of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland. Mr. Hume 
says the committee's decision demonstrates the significance of the 
Irish Peace agreement. Those powerful statements was a statement of 
our own people. In the referendum. A vast majority expressing their 
strong support. The international community, in its different ways, 
have also expressed their support. But today's announcement from Norway 
by the Nobel Peace Committee to David Trimble and myself, is a very 
clear and powerful statement of approval for the Peace Process and 
of the international good will that exists for us. The two men were 
instrumental in helping forge the multi-party peace agreement reached 
in Belfast last April. The Nobel Prize Committee says Mr. Trimble 
showed great political courage to keep the Peace Process on track. 
Reg Impey is a member of Mr. Trimble's party. It's the first time, 
I think, somebody from the pro-union community has been acknowledged. 
The committee says Mr. Hume has been the clearest and most consistent 
leader in the quest for peace in the Province. Mr. Hume says he hoped 
the award was not premature.
