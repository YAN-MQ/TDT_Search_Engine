Family and friends today attended the funeral for Matthew shepard 
in casper, Wyoming. The 21-year-old student died Monday, five days 
after he was pistol-whipped and tied to a fence. Police say robbery 
was the primary motive, but shepard also apparently was singled out 
because he was gay. Two men have been charged with murder. Some anti-gay 
protesters gathered near the church today despite a city council ban 
on picketing. Shepard's family is thanking the public for its support. 
On behalf of our son Matthew shepard, we want to thank the citizens 
of the United States and the people of the world who have expressed 
their deepest sympathy and condolences to our family during these 
trying times. A person as caring and loving as our son Matt would 
be overwhelmed by what this incident has done to the hearts and souls 
of people around the world. Later in our newscast -- we'll look at 
how shepard's death sparked a debate about tolerance over the Internet.
