U.N. Secretary General, Kofi Annan has accused the United States of 
failing in its moral and legal obligations to the United Nations. 
By not paying its dues. Speaking to a conservative Washington group, 
Mr. Annan bitterly noted that the United States plans to pay just 
enough dues this year to avoid losing its vote in the U.N. General 
Assembly. A budget deal that would have allowed the United States 
to pay off all of its back dues collapsed when Republican leaders 
added anti-abortion language. Something President Clinton says is 
unacceptable. I'm Dave DeForest, VOA NEWS.
