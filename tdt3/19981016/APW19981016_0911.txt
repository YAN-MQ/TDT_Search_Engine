The U.N.'s resident representative in Cyprus started on Friday a series 
of meeting with leaders of the estranged Greek and Turkish communities 
in the U.N.'s latest bid to reunite this war-divided island. Ann Hercus 
met President Glafcos Clerides in Nicosia and said she would meet 
with Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Wednesday in the Turkish-occupied 
part of the capital. Hercus, from New Zealand, said she was due to 
meet Clerides again next Thursday, but revealed nothing on the substance 
of her talks with Clerides. The shuttle diplomacy is aimed at finding 
sufficient common ground to restart direct negotiations to end the 
unofficial division of Cyprus caused by Turkey's 1974 invasion and 
the subsequent occupation of the northern third of the Mediterranean 
island. The invasion was in response to a coup inspired by the Greek 
military to unite Cyprus with Greece. The island's two communities 
have lived apart since then on either sides of a ``green line,'' which 
is policed by a U.N. force. Clerides and Denktash last met in Switzerland 
in August last year for U.N.-sponsored negotiations that failed to 
narrow their differences. Denktash has since said that he had no wish 
to resume talks unless the Greek Cypriots, whose government is the 
only internationally recognized administration on the island, withdraws 
its bid to join the European Union. He has also demanded the recognition 
of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Clerides, 
whose government began membership talks with the EU in March, has 
rejected both conditions. The start of the talks coincided with an 
announcement by a Greek Cypriot general that Greek air, ground and 
naval forces would take part in war games scheduled to begin in Cyprus 
next week. Speaking at a news conference, Brigadier-General Panayiotis 
Tatsiopoulos said that in the drills, Greek warplanes might use a 
controversial new air base near the western town of Paphos. Greek-Turkish 
tension rose considerably in March when Greek jets landed at the Paphos 
base less than a month after its completion. Turkey condemned the 
deployment as belligerent and sent warplanes to the north of the island 
days later. Although allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
Greece and Turkey have a rivalry going back centuries and both are 
committed to the defense of their fellow communities on Cyprus.
