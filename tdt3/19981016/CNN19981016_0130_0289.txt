White House and congressional negotiators have reached a budget deal. 
An announcement was made Thursday afternoon, following an intense 
week of meetings and two weeks into the fiscal year. A few key issues 
delayed the final handshake of the $500 billion package, that includes 
funding for 100,000 new teachers and emergency aid for farmers hurt 
by low crop prices this year. Both democrats and republicans are praising 
the deal and highlighting their respective party victories. We did 
save the surplus for the hard work of social security reform early 
next year. Secondly, we made major strides in renewing our public 
schools, especially with the truly historic commitment to put 100,000 
new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. And thirdly, 
we made a profound commitment to strengthening our own economy here 
by assuming our responsibility to stabilize the global economy on 
which so much of our prosperity depends. Senate majority leader Trent 
Lott says he's glad the deal was reached before a government shutdown. 
I think this has been a phenomenal success. And I'm glad we brought 
it to a conclusion without an unnecessary, uncalled for, and shouldn't 
have even been threatened, shutdown. We got our work done. That's 
the main point. When we come together, roll up our sleeves, work hard, 
long hours, we can achieve the things that we're supposed to do for 
the people that sent us here in the first place. Lott says actual 
congressional votes on the budget could come Friday.
