Police on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula have arrested several people 
suspected of being involved in ritual killings, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency said Friday. Investigators believe they are members of a satanic 
cult, ITAR-Tass said, quoting the Crimean prosecutor's office. It 
said the suspects were originally arrested in connection with an assault 
on a watchman at a theater in the Crimean capital, Simferopol. A search 
of one of the suspect's apartments turned up a human skull coated 
with varnish. The 19-year-old suspect confessed the skull belonged 
to one of the cult's victims, ITAR-Tass said. It said he gave details 
of a similar ritual killing in the summer in which the cult members 
strangled a 14-year-old girl and cut off her head and boiled it.
