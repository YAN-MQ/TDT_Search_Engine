International advisers will help Georgia modernize its armed forces 
``in line with European standards,'' President Eduard Shevardnadze 
said Friday. ``It takes time to change the old way of thinking,'' 
Shevardnadze said, according to the Interfax news agency. A group 
of international experts has been in the former Soviet republic for 
almost a week, giving advice. No other details were given.
