While much of the focus of World Food Day is on the African Continent, 
in one part of the African Continent. It is not food, but money, which 
is generating concern. A decision by South Africa's huge Anglo-American 
mining corporation to merge with its offshore arm, and relocate its 
headquarters to London. Is stirring controversy in South Africa. VOA 
Johannesburg correspondent, Alex Bolito reports. Kasatu, South Africa's 
powerful trade union confederation, has sharply condemned Anglo's 
move. It charges in a statement, that the corporation, the county's 
largest, is deserting south Africa. And in doing so, is demonstrating 
what Kasatu calls a lack of patriotism. Anglo announced Thursday, 
that it was joining the overseas arm it set up during the Apartay 
charged: the move is a vote of no confidence in South Africa. Especially 
in the midst of the county's unemployment crisis. The National Union 
of Mineworkers, also voiced dissastifaction. It asked if major South 
African firms, like Anglo, were moving their primary stock listings 
abroad, why should foreign investors be excited about coming to South 
Africa? The government of President Nelson Mandela, has given its 
blessings to Anglo's move. Saying it should not reduce the contributions 
to the economy. The financial newspaper, Business Report, agrees. 
But in a front page editorial, the publication warned the psychological 
impact of Anglo's relocation may tear at, what it called, the reconciliatory 
fabric of the new South Africa. Alex Bolita, VOA NEWS, Johannesburg.
