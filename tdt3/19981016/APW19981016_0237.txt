The world's club of industrialized nations will go ahead with a new 
round of investment liberalization talks next week despite France's 
pullout, the OECD said Friday. The Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development said the meeting at its headquarters Tuesday will 
be to discuss ``possible approaches for future action'' toward hammering 
out the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, or MAI. Trade and finance 
ministers from the 29 OECD nations decided in April to put the talks 
on hold for six months, in large part due to French resistance to 
lowering certain barriers to investment. On Wednesday, Prime Minister 
Lionel Jospin appeared to drive the nail in the coffin on the talks 
strongly backed by the United States, saying France would shun Tuesday's 
meeting. Instead, he urged new negotiations instead at the Geneva-based 
World Trade Organization, as Canada has also suggested. Paris sees 
the MAI as threatening its artistic, cultural and audiovisual industries, 
which many in France feel already suffer from too much American influence. 
The French, in turn, wanted Washington to move toward eliminating 
laws that call for imposing sanctions on countries for investing in 
Cuba, Iran and Libya. ``We want that negotiations be able to resume 
on a totally new basis and in the framework associating all actors, 
meaning all countries, including the developing ones,'' the Socialist 
prime minister told lawmakers during a question-and-answer session 
at the National Assembly.
