A handful of jokes about Martha Stewart, a dig at Barbie and an excursion 
into the sex life of toys cannot rescue the comic Grand Guignol that 
is ``Bride of Chucky'' from the graveyard of horror sequels that lose 
the heartbeat of inspiration long before they die of box office anemia. 
``Bride of Chucky,'' directed this time by Ronny Yu, splatters blood, 
piles up corpses and puts two star-crossed young lovers in peril before 
it reaches the inevitable conclusion (in a Hackensack, N.J. graveyard) 
that suggests that the family of Chucky films that began in 1988 with 
``Child's Play'' is prepared to grow yet again. But the novelty of 
a bloody horror film built around a malevolent doll carrying the soul 
of a serial killer has worn thin. In the fourth of these films written 
by Don Mancini, Jennifer Tilly manages to provide signs of a pulse 
for a few minutes at the outset in the role of Tiffany. She is a tarty, 
bottle-blond specimen of trailer-park trash who for a decade has been 
carrying a misguided torch for the serial killer, Charles Lee Ray. 
It seems that Ray died leaving behind an expensive diamond ring that 
Tiffany inferred was intended as a token of his love for her. Romantic 
fool that she is, Tiffany bribes a police officer to sneak into the 
Lockport Police Evidence Depository one dark and stormy night and 
remove a plastic bag containing the remains of Chucky. Back at the 
trailer after disposing of the policeman, the mini-skirted Tiffany 
stitches up the demolished doll, gets out her copy of ``Voodoo for 
Dummies'' and restores Chucky to life, only to learn that he never 
intended to marry her. So she locks him into a cradle with a lid and 
angrily tosses in a doll dressed as a bride to keep him company. While 
Tiffany is sipping white wine in a bubble bath and watching Elsa Lanchester 
and Boris Karloff plight their troth in James Whale's infinitely better 
``Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935), Chucky is busy sawing his way out 
of his prison with the aid of the doll's wedding ring. And when he 
attacks Tiffany, and the television set falls into the bath water, 
Tiffany's soul is transferred to the bridal doll. At this point, ``Bride 
of Chucky'' runs out of figurative gas, though not out of hot air.
