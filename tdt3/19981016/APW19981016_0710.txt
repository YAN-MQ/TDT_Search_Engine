The NATO allies decided Friday to maintain the threat of airstrikes 
against Serbia until at least Oct. 27, extending the original deadline 
set for Saturday morning. NATO officials said the allies wanted to 
keep the allied strike force of some 400 warplanes ready for possible 
strikes, despite the Kosovo peace deal struck this week with the Serb 
authorities. ``We are still at some distance from fully compliance,'' 
said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, adding the alliance had ``clear evidence'' 
that Serb troops and police remained in the province.
