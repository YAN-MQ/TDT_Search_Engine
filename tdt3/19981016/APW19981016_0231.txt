John Hume, joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said Friday that 
the honor represents ``very powerful international approval of the 
peace process in Northern Ireland.'' Hume, leader of the Social Democratic 
and Labor Party, which gets the largest share of votes from Northern 
Ireland's Roman Catholic minority, worked tirelessly in pursuit of 
a cease-fire by the Irish Republican Army and for all-party negotiations. 
He shared the prize with David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist 
Party, which gets the largest share of Protestant votes. ``I think 
that today's announcement from the Nobel committee strengthens our 
peace process enormously because it tells all the people what the 
world want to see on our streets,'' Hume told a news conference in 
Belfast. He said the most powerful support for the process came from 
the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, who overwhelmingly 
approved the peace agreement in a referendum in May. ``The international 
community in its different ways has also expressed its support, but 
today's annoucement from Norway by the Nobel peace committee to David 
Trimble and myself is a very clear and powerful statement of approval 
for the peace process and of the international goodwill that exists 
for us. ``And as I have said often to many of you recently, the challenge 
to all of us now, as public representatives in Northern Ireland from 
all parties, is to harness that international goodwill for the benefit 
of all our people, particularly our young people,'' Hume said.
