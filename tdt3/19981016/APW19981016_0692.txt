Already struggling with a massive influx of Kosovo Albanians, Swiss 
authorities said Friday they expect the number of asylum seekers to 
reach an all-time high this year. Nearly 500 refugees had to fend 
for themselves overnight _ some huddled under cardboard boxes for 
warmth _ as overflowing reception centers closed their doors to new 
arrivals. ``The situation is very serious and it may get worse,'' 
said Vera Britsch, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Refugees. 
Switzerland, home to a large population of ethnic Albanians, has acted 
as a magnet to refugees fleeing the fighting in Serbia's Kosovo province. 
But a new influx has overwhelmed local and national authorities. The 
government next week is to consider using soldiers to help care for 
the Kosovo Albanians. And it plans to open army barracks to house 
the overflow. Ethnic Albanians accounted for a large chunk of the 
26,000 requests for asylum _ 57 percent more than in 1997 _ in the 
first nine months of the year. A big jump is expected for October 
as many more are believed to be en route, either via Italy or from 
eastern Europe through Germany. Jean-Daniel Gerber, director of the 
refugee office, said he expected the number of asylum seekers to top 
the record of 42,000, set in 1991, by the end of the year. Tough asylum 
laws cut numbers after that. Swiss officials complain that their tiny 
country, with a population of 7 million, is now shouldering too much 
of the refugee problem and that neighboring France, Italy and Austria 
should be doing more. ``We have the impression that they are concentrating 
on Switzerland,'' said Britsch. ``There's no burden sharing.'' Germany 
has also seen a big increase in the number of ethnic Albanians applying 
to stay. Kosovo refugees pose more headaches than Bosnians who fled 
their earlier civil war. And whilst there was widespread public sympathy 
for Bosnians, Kosovo Albanians have a bad reputation for drug dealing 
and crime. Swiss refugee director Gerber faced a hostile reception 
from worried residents Thursday evening in the small northern village 
of Bronschhofen, where an empty army barracks is to be used for the 
refugees. A small device exploded at the barracks earlier this week. 
The refugee center at nearby Kreuzlingen, on the German border, is 
so crowded that people are reportedly sleeping in the kitchen and 
in corridors. In Basel, on the border with Germany and France, about 
170 ethnic Albanians were turned away from an accommodation center 
Thursday night as there was no room for them. In Geneva, on the French 
border, 300 people had to fend for themselves, said Britsch. Most 
managed to stay with friends, although some spent the night in the 
open, she said. ``Disgraceful,'' lamented the mass selling daily Blick 
above a front-page photo of haggard refugees thronged around a wire 
gate. ``Switzerland can't even offer a bed for refugees. It turns 
people back away and sends them back into the dark night.''
