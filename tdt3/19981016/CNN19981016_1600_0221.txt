Palestinian sources say President Clinton is increasing the pressure 
on the mideast summit in Maryland. The sources say Mr. Clinton told 
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat he would like them to reach an agreement by Monday or Tuesday. 
If not, Mr. Clinton says the U.S. will reduce its involvement in the 
process. The two sides are trying to reach an agreement on turning 
over more of West Bank to the Palestinians in return for security 
guarantees for Israel.
