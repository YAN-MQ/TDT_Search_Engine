Facing a European Commission threat to ban its beef exports, Portugal 
will spend dlrs 18 million until the end of the year in new measures 
aimed at stemming a sharp rise in cases of ``mad cow'' disease, an 
official said Friday. The measures include tightening government control 
at slaughterhouses and in animal by-product industries as well as 
destroying stocks of cattle feed with bovine remains, Agriculture 
Ministry spokesman Augusto Vilela said. The government will also double 
fines to escudos 18 million (dlrs 110,000) for violators of the measures 
and others previously approved. Vilela said the European Commission 
was to discuss the new measures next week. Earlier this month, the 
Commission threatened a Europe-wide ban on beef exports from Portugal 
unless the government tightened controls on bovine animal remains 
used in cattle feed. Neighboring Spain banned the import of Portuguese 
beef last month. Portugal has reported 60 new cases of ``mad cow'' 
disease in the past five months, compared with a total of 94 cases 
for all previous years. In addition, there are at least 28 suspected 
but unconfirmed cases. The disease's incubation period is long, and 
the recent rise in cases has sparked fears that the scale of the problem 
in Portugal may be much bigger than is apparent at present. In Britain, 
the cattle disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has 
been linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal human brain ailment.
