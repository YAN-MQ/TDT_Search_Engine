Scientists in London have come up with a new theory about rising sea 
levels. Findings from Antarctica suggests the polar icecaps are melting 
more slowly than previously thought. It means rising sea levels have 
less to do with melting ice than expanding water. With the details, 
here's Ruth Linton of the BBC's science unit. An international team 
of scientists has been taking radar measurements of the thickness 
of the Antarctic icesheet since 1992. The scientists say Antarctic 
melting couldn't have contributed less than 10 percent of the global 
rise in sea level this century. The rest of the rise must have come 
from the ocean's expansion, as the world warms up and the melting 
of continental glaciers. In which case, predictions of future rises 
in sea level, due to global warming will have to be seriously re-thought.
