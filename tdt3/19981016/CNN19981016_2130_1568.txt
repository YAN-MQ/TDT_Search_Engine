"X-file" junkies, disco Queens and fans of animation may want take 
a movie home this weekend. Dennis Michael tells us what's new at the 
video store. Well, I just climbed up 12 floors. I'm hot, I'm thirsty, 
and to be honest, I'm wondering what I'm doing up here. If you're 
an "X-files" fanatic, you don't have to be filled in. If you aren't, 
"the X-files" movie is a long, steep learning curve. "The X-files" 
format takes delight in obscurity and mystery and hidden significance. 
But the movie isn't too friendly to entry-level viewers, which means 
you already know if you are going to see it or not. The uninitiated 
can enjoy some cool special effects, while they're trying to figure 
out why they're fighting the future. You know the Woodstock generation 
of the 1960s that were so full of themselves and conceited? None of 
those people could dance. Yeah, maybe, but at least there was no polyester 
in the mud wallow. "The last days of disco" is a smart postmortem 
of a dumb era. The script has sharp-tongued dialogue with a somewhat 
dumber plot, but it'll be one of those movies like "rashomon." Your 
reaction to it will depend on where you were and what you were wearing 
on those boogie nights of yore. I don't want a new dress. I want to 
save Camelot. The Arthur legends are so remarkable. Why do filmmakers 
keep making movies intended to be about them without ever bothering 
to actually read them or tell them? "Quest for Camelot" is lavishly, 
but not terribly, interestingly animated. In fact, rumor has it, it 
cost about $100 million. But script analysis probably ended up on 
the budget sheet right after paper clips and doughnuts for the staff. 
The story has little or nothing to do with legend or logic. And when 
you toss in a two-headed dragon doing an Elvis imitation, you're headed 
for Saturday morning, not for the round table. See you at the rental 
counter. Dennis Michael, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
