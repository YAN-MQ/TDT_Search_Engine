Wherever people are talking about Matthew shepard's murder, people 
are also talking about violence in general against gays and lesbians. 
It's a national problem that doesn't get a lot of attention. Gays 
and lesbians say it doesn't get enough attention. The overall crime 
rates in the country have been going up. Here's ABC's Rebecca chase. 
In this support group in Dallas, lesbian and gay teenagers describe 
the daily harassment. And some guy threw a beer bottle at me while 
I was at the bus stop and yelled, faggot. The physical threats, the 
violence. I've had death threats in my lockers, I've had a gun pulled 
on me. I've had a knife pulled on me. I was cut with a knife. I was 
beat up pretty much every day. I couldn't go to my classes without 
being harassed. Studies show that as many as 30% of gay high school 
and college students have been threatened or injured. A survey of 
colleges found that hate crimes for sexual orientation are the most 
violent. There was four that beat him with boards with nails in them, 
and then one of them used a knife and stabbed him three times. Nancy 
broussard is describing the murder of her 27-year-old son. As violent 
as it was, it is the type of case often left out of official FBI hate 
crime statistics, because in the initial investigation, the motive 
may be unclear. In its most recent yearly report the FBI said three 
people have been murdered because of their sexual orientation. The 
national coalition of anti-violence programs counted 21 murders. I 
would call that an epidemic of hate being acted out against lesbians 
and gay men in this country. Epidemic may seem a strong word, but 
when Houston police went undercover to combat anti-gay violence, they 
encountered violence every night. The big deal is you hit an officer 
in the mouth. But I apologized for that. I thought he was a damn queer. 
It's attitudes like that, say activists, that feed the violence. Rebecca 
chase, ABC News, Atlanta.
