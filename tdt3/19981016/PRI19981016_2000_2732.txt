Well, Yankee fans or not, many of New York's 300,000 Dominicans will 
tune into tomorrow's opening game, too. That's because Dominican slugger 
Sammy Sosa will throw out the ceremonial first pitch. It's all part 
of two days of activities for Sosa. He'll also be part of a parade 
in his honor down Broadway. New York City Councilman DeYermo Yunades 
says that he and his fellow Dominican Americans are proud of Sosa's 
chase for the single-season home run record. The is an embrace that 
New Yorkers are giving Sammy Sosa, as our true hero. I cannot tell 
you how exciting the whole -- was. And every time Sammy hit a new 
home run, you would see all over the place in the windshields of cars, 
"Sosa 60, 62, 66." Even my car had Sosa's name as a way of celebrating 
and identifying with his effort. Sosa will toss out the first pitch 
at Yankee Stadium tomorrow night, well after the opener in the Japanese 
world series has concluded.
