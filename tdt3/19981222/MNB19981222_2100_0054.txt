Another busy day in our nation's capital but what they've really been 
talking about there and just about everywhere else is the weather. 
An Arctic chill is embracing much of the country. It will indeed be 
a white Christmas but a lot of people are finding it tough going. 
Here's Jim Cummins. Winter has arrived on schedule in places like 
Duluth, Minnesota, but this arctic blast is driving temperatures to 
record lows in Los Angeles, turning interstate highways into parking 
lots in Texas, causing widespread power outages in Mississippi, and 
stranding thousands of air travelers on the eve of the busiest holiday 
travel period, more than 45 million people going somewhere for Christmas. 
There's absolutely no parking. It's unbelievable. I thought Thanksgiving 
was bad. In much of the country, highway travel is even worse. The 
deep south is in a deep freeze and most of the ice covers the roads. 
Rain, freezing rain, and sleet stretch across the country from the 
tennessee valley into the carolinas. Overnight 0 two chain reaction 
accidents near Austin, Texas, involving 58 cars. Patrolman Todd meyers 
helps rescue a woman from one car. Nobody's paying attention to the 
road. In Dallas, more than 500 wrecks between midnight and noon. I 
didn't have too bad a time of it until right here. "Right here" is 
sandwiched between a city bus and a minivan. The timing couldn't be 
worse. The need to De-ice airplanes in places where there are few 
De-icers will affect mail deliveries and overnight service too. FedEx 
admits some delays due to delays at their hub in Memphis. In some 
places the police can't wait for salt and sand trucks. Bob Davis, 
a citrus Grower in the central valley of California, says he's waging 
-- waging war against this. It is a war and we're using any ammunition 
we have available. Including water, helicopters, fans and Orchard 
heaters. We're above critical. This first real blast of winter has 
caught much of the country off guard, bringing a -- bring a white 
Christmas from the upper midwest to northern New England. But for 
much of the south there is no end in sight. The deep freeze is forecast 
to last through Christmas and experts warn there could be more ice 
storms.
