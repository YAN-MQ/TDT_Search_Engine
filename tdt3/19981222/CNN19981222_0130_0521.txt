This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Tuesday. A cold front will continue to push eastward 
through the eastern United States, dropping all the way through the 
gulf coast and into Florida. The air will be cold enough that there 
will be some snow in parts of Texas on Tuesday. We'll also see some 
lake-effect snows around the Great Lakes and rain and snow moving 
into New England. It'll be cold just about everywhere. The only warm 
spots will be across Florida and a couple of places in the southwest. 
Looking ahead to Wednesday, look for an icy mix through the Ohio and 
tennessee river valleys. Snow in the Great Lakes and also the northwest. 
Thursday, Christmas eve, most of the rain and snow is on the east 
coast and in the south, with a few showers across the northwest. For 
Friday, still pretty cold across much of the country. Snowy and windy 
around the Great Lakes. Rain showers in the southeast, and rain and 
snow in the northwest. Don't forget, you can find four-day forecasts 
for more than 7,200 cities on cNN interactive. The address is CNN.com.
