The Justice Department has closed its investigation into the competitive 
practices of the Frito-Lay unit of Pepsico Inc. with no finding of 
wrongdoing. For more than two years, the government had been looking 
into possible anti-competitive practices within the salty-snack industry, 
centering largely on Frito-Lay, the dominant company. Smaller competitors 
had complained that Frito-Lay was buying huge blocks of space on supermarket 
shelves and securing exclusive promotions as a way of locking out 
smaller makers of snacks. The Justice Department confirmed a report 
in The Wall Street Journal on Monday that the investigation had been 
closed. Frito-Lay, which had revenue last year of $10.4 billion, said 
that it had never engaged in unlawful trade practices. ``We are very 
pleased with their decision,'' said Lynn Markley, a spokeswoman for 
the company. Analysts estimate that Frito-Lay, the maker of Fritos 
and Doritos, controls well over half the salty- snack business. Its 
share has steadily grown as it has introduced successful new products. 
The unit has also gained as several competitors, like Anheuser-Busch 
and Borden Inc., left the business. ``From our standpoint, there never 
has been any mystery as to how we've been successful over the years,'' 
Markley added. ``Our commitment to the business and growing in our 
business have allowed us to stay ahead.'' Analysts said Frito-Lay 
was known for its aggressive industry practices but that the government's 
decision to end the inquiry without a finding of wrongdoing bolstered 
the company's position that it was not breaking the law with its heavy-handed 
marketing practices. ``The problem is Frito-Lay is kind of damned 
for being so big, but big doesn't necessarily mean bad,'' said George 
Thompson, an analyst who follows the company and the supermarket industry 
for Prudential Securities. ``I'm sure they are very aggressive, but 
my experience has been that they are also very aware of what their 
position is relative to everyone else and they have to be very, very 
careful.'' He said that although small competitors might feel overwhelmed 
by Frito-Lay's dominance, supermarket operators devote big blocks 
of shelf space to the company's products because, like soft drinks, 
popular snacks drive store traffic. Also, he said, Frito-Lay is a 
leader in efficiency and passes on part of its cost savings to consumers. 
``Supermarkets develop their brand franchises in large part based 
on the value they provide a consumer with,'' Thompson said. ``Supermarkets 
are going to be much more inclined to give promotional space to the 
leading brands.''
