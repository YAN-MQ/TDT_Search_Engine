As promised, a 15-pound cement frog missing from the lawn of a Massachusetts 
home since easter is home for the holidays. According to the frog's 
kidnappers, it just needed to get away from the grind of garden life. 
The owners say they got postcards and pictures from the frog from 
New York, venice, Indonesia and Venezuela. The frog arrived home Monday 
in the back of a limo, wearing a straw hat.
