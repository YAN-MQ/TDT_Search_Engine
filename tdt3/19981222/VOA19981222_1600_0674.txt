Namibian troops have arrived in the Angolan town of Huambo, to join 
Angolan government forces in their offensive against the UNITA rebel 
movement. VOA Correspondent, Alex Volita, reports from our Southern 
Africa bureau. Namibian authorities have denied claims by the UNITA 
rebel movement, that they and Zimbabwe have both sent troops to Angola 
to join the government's side in the latest fighting. But eye witnesses 
tell the VOA that a large contingent of Navidian soldiers did arrive 
by plane at Towambo airport at mid-afternoon on Monday. These sources 
say access to the facility was temporarily closed off, and that Namibians 
off-loaded at the far end of the runway from the terminal building, 
apparently to avoid drawing attention to their arrival. Angolan forces 
launched an offensive against UNITA, last month, in a bid to capture 
the rebel movement's twin central highland's strongholds of Andulu 
and Bilundu and to capture, or kill, UNITA's leaders. But, well armed 
UNITA's troops counterattacked, apparently conflicting heavy losses 
on the government side. Since then, UNITA forces have moved against 
several key government-held towns in the region, including Huambo. 
The fighting has shattered the country's 1994 Peace Accords, which 
ended two decades of civil war in oil and diamond-rich Angola. Alex 
Volita, VOA News, Southern Africa bureau.
