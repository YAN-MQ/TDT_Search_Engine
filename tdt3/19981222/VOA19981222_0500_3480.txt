Well, a long standing disagreement has been settled here. The United 
States and South Korea have agreed that Seoul will pay $333 million 
next year for maintaining 37,000 American soldiers that the U.S. keeps 
on its soil. Now, that figure is down from last year's $399 million. 
The South Korean government wanted to cut back the payment for these 
U.S. forces because South Korea has, as everyone knows, has some economic 
problems. American soldiers are kept in South Korea to help defend 
against a possible attack from North Korea.
