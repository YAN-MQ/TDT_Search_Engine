Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said Tuesday that he had done nothing 
wrong in accepting a large loan from colleague who is now under investigation 
by Mandelson's department. The Guardian newspaper said in Tuesday's 
editions that Mandelson, a close associate of Prime Minister Tony 
Blair, received a loan of 373,000 pounds (dlrs 627,000) in 1996 from 
fellow legislator Geoffrey Robinson, who is now the paymaster general. 
Some of Robinson's business interests are the subject of two Department 
of Trade and Industry investigations. Conservative Party spokesmen 
quickly attacked Mandelson, but he said: ``I am absolutely sure I 
have done nothing wrong.'' Mandelson, 45, was considered the main 
strategist for the Labor Party's landslide victory in the 1997 general 
election. Robinson, 50, has been a generous backer of the Labor Party, 
and 1996 he bought New Statesman, a weekly political journal which 
supports Labor. He had to apologize to the House of Commons for failing 
to declare some of his business interests, and has been criticized 
by opposition lawmakers for sheltering some of his assets in offshore 
trusts which are not subject to British taxation. Mandelson did not 
disclose the loan when he was appointed trade secretary earlier this 
year, and informed Blair of the loan last week, The Guardian said. 
``We need to know what strings are attached. We need to know if Mr. 
Robinson has bankrolled other senior members of the government,'' 
Conservative lawmaker John Redwood said. Conservative Peter Lilley, 
a former trade secretary, said the loan should have been disclosed 
as soon as Mandelson assumed his present post. ``The first thing that 
happens when you are appointed is the permanent secretary, the head 
civil servant, asks you to know all your interests, all your assets 
and liabilities. Peter Mandelson, it appears, did not tell him the 
truth,'' Lilley said. Blair's office said he was confident that Mandelson 
had been ``properly insulated'' from any decision by department officials 
related to Robinson's business interests. In an interview on British 
Broadcasting Corp. radio Tuesday, Mandelson said the loan was a ``personal 
arrangement made by two friends and colleagues.'' ``When you come 
into government you don't automatically lose your previous friendships 
or associations or arrangements. ``The key thing though is that when 
you do bring previous arrangements and associations into government 
you make sure there is no potential conflict of interest arising and 
that's exactly what I did.''
