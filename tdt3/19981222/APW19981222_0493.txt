Mark Bosnich may have played his last game for Aston Villa. After 
six seasons as the club's No. 1 goalkeeper, the 26-year-old Australian, 
who has turned down several offers of a new contract, is out of the 
team because of a shoulder injury and manager John Gregory is looking 
for a replacement. Michael Oakes, who has been understudy to Bosnich 
for the past four seasons, is performing well and Gregory is looking 
at experienced 'keepers, such as Dutch international Edwin van der 
Sar and French World Cup star Pierre Barthez to move to Villa Park. 
``There is that danger that Mark may have played his last game for 
Villa if someone comes in and establishes themselves,'' Gregory said 
on Tuesday after Villa had re-estabilished its 3-point lead atop the 
Premier League by winning at Charlton on Monday. ``But then I think 
Mark is aware of the dilemma we are in as a football club and that 
we have to look to replace him if he decides to go. ``Mark knows we 
have to do what is in the best interests of Aston Villa. There is 
no sympathetic view taken by myself. It's all about business and putting 
a winning team on the pitch.'' Bosnich, who will be a free agent at 
the end of this season, has been linked with a move to Italian club 
AS Roma. Because of his shoulder injury, which will sideline the Australian 
for up to two months, there was speculation that Gregory might go 
for England Under-21 'keeper Richard Wright. But the Villa manager 
discounted a move for the 21-year-old Ipswich player. ``Mark is 26. 
There are not many Englishman of the same age and ability, and we 
might have to cast our net a little bit wider,'' Gregory said. ``You 
want people with experience if they are going to have to be pitched 
into a championship battle. ``We are not in a situation where we can 
look at some of the better younger players around because the step 
up would be a massive one. I have ruled out Richard Wright. ``I also 
don't want a stop-gap. I don't want to pay 2 million pound (dlrs 3.4 
million) to get someone in to the end of the season and then have 
to go out and spend 5 million (dlrs 8.3 million) on another one,'' 
Gregory said. ``It is one thing being linked to Van der Saar and Barthez 
_ but I do believe Aston Villa are in a position to entice those sort 
of people here.''
