Declaring that Republicans in Washington had undermined the party 
with a series of ``horrible blunders'' this year, Gov. George E. Pataki 
of New York said Tuesday that elected officials from beyond the nation's 
capital were more in tune with Republican ideology and better suited 
to help the party regain the White House in 2000. Pataki announced 
that he would travel the nation to offer alternatives to the ``failed 
strategies'' his party had embraced. Pataki's criticisms of his party, 
voiced in a series of conversations over the last two weeks, were 
directed both at congressional leaders, for the way they handled the 
national elections, and, to a lesser extent, at his own political 
consultants for the way they ran Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's unsuccessful 
re-election campaign. Although Pataki assailed Republicans for neglecting 
their cornerstone issues to focus on the Lewinsky affair, he declined 
Tuesday to criticize the House vote to impeach President Clinton. 
But he strongly urged the Senate to ``come up with a bipartisan solution'' 
that, he said, would not involve removing Clinton from office. ``Republicans 
have governed highly successfully across the country, in traditionally 
Republican states and traditionally Democratic states, with a philosophy 
that works, that unites the Republican Party, and that unites the 
Republican Party with a majority of the American people,'' Pataki 
said. ``It's only in Washington _ largely in Washington _ where the 
national party has lost that agenda, has gone off on tangents, has 
had a very difficult time transitioning from opposition to governing,'' 
Pataki added. The governor's remarks came as his advisers say he is 
considering a run for national office, and at a time when some Republicans 
suggest that Pataki's own solid re-election effort could be tarnished 
by the otherwise poor showing of the New York party last month, with 
losses by both D'Amato and incumbent Attorney General Dennis Vacco. 
Pataki's decision to travel the nation left little doubt that he wanted 
Republicans nationally to consider his ideas _ and, perhaps, Pataki 
himself _ in assembling their ticket and platform for 2000. That said, 
Pataki was vague about his exact political intentions. He would not 
rule out running for national office in 2000. But he also said he 
was now considering seeking a third term as governor in 2002. In the 
interviews, Pataki asserted that Republicans in Washington had neglected 
touchstone conservative issues _ reducing taxes, slashing government 
regulation, cutting the welfare rolls and promoting ``a strong national 
defense'' _ in the rush to focus on Clinton's personal life and on 
issues like opposition to abortion rights and gay rights. It fell 
to Republican governors like himself, Pataki said, to steer the party 
back to the successful course it followed under Ronald Reagan, which 
he said accounted for the party's dominance in the 1980s. Pataki offered 
a novel retort to the suggestion that Republicans like himself, who 
favor abortion rights and some gay rights, could never survive the 
generally conservative Republican nominating process: He maintained 
that he held the ``truly conservative'' viewpoint on both those issues. 
``I am a conservative,'' Pataki said. ``But I believe in limited government. 
I happen to think that limited government includes keeping government 
out of the private lives of people. I consider that to be a natural 
extension of the belief in individual privacy.'' Pataki's advisers 
arrived at an interview two weeks ago with research to demonstrate 
that Pataki's victory margin _ more than 20 percentage points over 
his nearest rival, in a relatively crowded and well-financed field 
_ was the largest of any Republican gubernatorial candidate in the 
state's history. Pataki said he had no regrets about the way he ran 
his campaign. However, he was critical of the way his own political 
consultants, Arthur Finkelstein and Kieran Mahoney, managed D'Amato's 
contest for a fourth term. ``One of the things we did not do is give 
the voters a reason to vote for Senator D'Amato, as opposed to voting 
against Chuck Schumer,'' Pataki said, referring to the Democratic 
congressman from Brooklyn who defeated D'Amato. Finkelstein did not 
return calls seeking comment, and Mahoney declined to comment on Pataki's 
remarks.
