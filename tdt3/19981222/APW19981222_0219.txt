Christmas festivities started Tuesday in Spanish towns whose residents 
split the 300 million pesetas (dlrs 2.1-million) top prize in Spain's 
lottery _ billed as the world's richest. The lottery, known as ``El 
Gordo'' (The Fat One), sells 66,000 tickets valued at 30,000 pesetas 
(dlrs 2,100) for each of 140 numbered series. The tickets are subsequently 
divided into 10 shares worth 3,000 pesetas (dlrs 21) each. Most Spaniards 
share tickets with family, friends and co-workers, so lottery windfalls 
ripple through whole communities. Millions of television viewers watched 
Madrid schoolchildren pick out numbered balls from drums and sing 
out the winning number _ 21856 _ on Tuesday morning. The second prize 
of 144 million pesetas (dlrs 1 million) was for number 07308. The 
annual lottery, which began in 1818, was dishing out 194-billion pesetas 
(dlrs 1.4-billion) this year to thousands of winners throughout Spain. 
Income from ticket sales was 250 billion pesetas (dlrs 1.8 billion) 
this year, 8.9 percent higher than last year, according to the State 
Lottery Department. The Spanish Treasury takes 30 percent of the prize 
money before the draw takes place to keep the winnings tax-free.
