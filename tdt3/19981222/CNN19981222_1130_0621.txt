There is a little more than a year left before we find out just how 
bad the year 2000 computer bug really is. A community in Maryland 
has prepared itself for the worst case scenario as rick Lockridge 
reports. Will these be the sites and sounds that greet the new millennium? 
You all right in there? We're going to be a couple of minutes? All 
right. We're getting a couple of tools together. a rescue at a stalled 
elevator. Traffic control supervisors scrambling to fix malfunctioning 
signals, a Room full of emergency officials assessing the impact of 
the year 2000 computer glitch. It is a January 1st, year 2000. This 
possible glimpse of things to come, a day-long drill by a Maryland 
county that spent thousands of hours trying to make sure it won't 
be derailed by Y2K day. We set out about two and a half years ago 
to occupy a leadership position on the year 2000 issue and I think 
that we've sustained that. The county rolled its computers forward 
to January 1st2000, a Trigger point for the Y2K date recognition problem. 
County officials watched to see if their administrative, traffic control 
and 911 emergency dispatch computers would crash. They did not. Montgomery 
county, 911, what is your emergency? It functioned properly. There 
fwhor operational problems no systems problems. They acknowledge Y2K 
problems could develop well after 1100 but they say they'll keep testing. 
Other counties may want to take note of their example. In light of 
a recent survey that finds half of all U.S. counties without adequate 
Y2K plans and 75% without emergency plans in case of a crash N if 
those numbers are correct, how many will be able to face their constituents 
and answer the question this county set out to answer? What with can 
he expect to present ourselfs to our citizens as being open for business? 
Counties that doddle may find themselves in a real jam. Rick Lockridge, 
CNN, Rockville, Maryland.
