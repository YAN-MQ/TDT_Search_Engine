Federal securities regulators accused W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. and six 
of its former executives of fraud on Tuesday, saying that the company 
had deceived shareholders over five years by falsely reporting earnings. 
The move was part of a larger plan by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to crack down on the growing number of companies, including 
some of the nation's largest, that break accounting rules so they 
can manipulate earnings and meet Wall Street's expectations. ``I hear 
from companies that say, `Everybody is doing it, so why can't we,' 
'' said Richard H. Walker, the SEC's director of enforcement. ``This 
is an area of great concern.'' According to a civil complaint filed 
in U.S. District Court in Miami, Grace, the large chemical company 
based in Boca Raton, Fla., was blessed with unexpected revenue in 
the early 1990s. But instead of reporting all that revenue, the complaint 
said, executives moved $10 million to $20 million to later years when 
business was not as good. Regulators said that by using the false 
accounting, the company was able to report that revenue was on the 
rise for its health care group from 1991 to 1993, even though actual 
revenue was declining. Regardless of the amount of revenue involved, 
the SEC said in the complaint, Grace management had misled investors 
just by not disclosing that it ``was engaged in an ongoing scheme 
to fraudulently manipulate its reported earnings.'' In a written statement, 
Grace said Tuesday that it would ``vigorously contest'' the accusations. 
The statement said the company believed its accounting in past years 
was proper and that the litigation should not have a significant impact 
on current earnings. The company said none of the executives involved 
in the questioned accounting still worked for the company. And, it 
said that its outside auditing firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was aware 
of the accounting and had not raised any objections. David Nestor, 
a spokesman for PriceWaterhousecoopers, said that the accounting firm 
did not comment on client matters. ``But we stand behind our work,'' 
he said. The company's share price fell $1.5625, or 9.65 percent, 
to $14.625, after the SEC's announcement on Tuesday. Regulators said 
Grace executives had declined to report $10 million to $20 million 
in revenue that the company had received in the early 1990s from a 
change in the Medicare reimbursement rules because the executives 
believed that it would not help the company's stock price. At the 
time, the company was already reporting revenue at a rate that Wall 
Street was expecting. So instead, according to the complaint, the 
executives set aside the unexpected Medicare revenue in another account 
and then gradually used it to increase revenue from 1993 to 1995. 
``When you manipulate earnings to show what you want to show and to 
not show the actual results,'' Walker said, ``shareholders are deceived.'' 
Regulators are continuing their investigation into Grace's accounting, 
he said, and plan to file similar complaints against other companies. 
The complaint filed on Tuesday in Miami seeks civil penalties and 
asks for an injunction restraining the company and its executives 
from further violations of federal securities laws. The revenue that 
the SEC is questioning was earned by a Grace subsidiary, National 
Medical Care Inc. of Waltham, Mass. The company sold National Medical 
Care, which operates kidney dialysis clinics, to Fresenius AG of Germany 
in 1996. Regulators said Grace executives used the unexpected revenue 
received by National Medical Care for ``profit planning purposes.'' 
The amounts, which were improperly deferred in the accounting books 
by setting up reserve accounts, were used later to increase revenue 
of the health care group to meet Wall Street's expectations and to 
raise the company's earnings reported in its consolidated financial 
statements. For example, for the fourth quarter of 1994, Grace senior 
managers asked executives at National Medical Care to report an additional 
$1.5 million in income, the regulators said, because Grace needed 
that amount to increase its consolidated earnings. Regulators also 
filed an administrative complaint against the former Grace executives, 
including J.P. Bolduc, who had been chief executive, contending that 
they helped issue the financial reports that the regulators say are 
false. Gerald Walpin, a lawyer for Bolduc, said that his client would 
contest the accusations and ``expects to be vindicated.'' He said 
the government's suit was ``an attempt to punish a chief executive 
for performing his responsibilities exactly as a responsible CEO should.''
