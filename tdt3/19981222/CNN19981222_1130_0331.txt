William Cohen will leave for a visit to the Persian gulf. Meanwhile, 
the Pentagon is calling "operation desert fox" a success. The commander 
of the U.S. forces in the gulf says 85% of Iraqi targets were hit. 
But parts of the Iraqi air defense system are still in place. Jamie 
McIntyre has the assessment. The troops began evacuating as soon as 
the withdrawal of U.N. inspectors signaled air strikes were immeant. 
I think once they saw the UNSCOM team coming out, they were beginning 
to react. Baghdad claimed the precision, U.S. and British air strikes 
killed some of the troops out of the four republican guard divisions 
they target. The prime minister said the U.S. was bombing buildings 
and charged again the bombs and missiles struck civilian targets. 
They're at hospitals, private homes, schools, and other civilian sites. 
We absolutely do not target those types of things. The commander of 
U.S. troops in the Persian gulf would not confirm what sources say. 
But the U.S. hoped to kill thousands of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's 
most loyal troops is what they said, insisting it was enough to destroy 
their bases. There are a lot of people that have no place to go home 
to. These barracks and bullings could be and will be rebuilt. The 
Pentagon score card showed of 100 targets, 85 were hit and the dooth 
74 was deemed to be fully successful. "Operation desert fox" was a 
highly successful operation. The U.S. insist it had particular success 
destroying facilities iraq was using to develop new longer range missiles. 
Facilities it estimates will take Iraq a year or more to rebuild.
