While the United States boasted of the success of the U.S.-British 
bombardment of Iraq, the country's state-run newspapers also claimed 
victory Tuesday on the basis that President Saddam Hussein remains 
in power. ``The enemies made a bid that a riot would take place in 
the country, but they were wrong because Iraqis are closer to their 
leader now than ever,'' the weekly Al-Ittihad said in an editorial 
Tuesday. The view was echoed in other government newspapers, which 
also claimed the four-day attack last week built sympathy for Iraq 
among the world's Muslims. Also Tuesday, about 120 U.N. humanitarian 
workers evacuated during the airstrikes headed back to Baghdad from 
neighboring Jordan. A U.N. official said they would be back at work 
Wednesday. Khalid al-Izzi, an aide to U.N. humanitarian coordinator 
Hans von Sponeck, said the first job would be to assess damage from 
the airstrikes. On Monday night, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz 
gave the first official casualty figures for soldiers in the bombardment, 
saying 62 were killed and 180 wounded. He repeated assertions that 
many more civilians were killed, but refused to give figures. Iraqi 
authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites where they 
reported heavy civilian casualties as they have in the past _ an indication 
the casualties either were not high or were scattered. The attacks 
targeted key military bases, government buildings, communication centers 
and military factories. U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the airstrikes 
after chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq of 
failing to fully cooperate with his inspectors. The weapons inspectors 
must certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction before 
the U.N. Security Council will lift economic sanctions imposed on 
Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Aziz and other officials 
said the attacks disrupted telephone communications to Iraq's south 
and heavily damaged factories that could be used to manufacture long-range 
missiles prohibited under the U.N. resolutions. In Washington, U.S. 
Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni said the strikes hit 85 percent of 
their targets, 74 percent of them successfully. He said a full damage 
assessment of damage would probably take a few more days. Zinni, head 
of Central Command which oversees U.S. military operations in the 
Middle East, showed pictures of damage to Iraq's Defense Ministry 
in Baghdad and the headquarter of the ruling Baath Party. ``I guarantee 
you, nobody's working in the Baath Party headquarters,'' he joked, 
pointing to the scarred building. U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, 
who was with Zinni as he briefed reporters, termed Operation Desert 
Fox ``highly successful.'' In London, British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair said the airstrikes have set back parts of Iraq's ``military 
infrastructure several years.'' Aziz maintained, however, that most 
of the strikes hit empty barracks, adding that ``these barracks could 
be and will be rebuilt.'' A U.S. intelligence report revealed by ABC 
News said most critical equipment from inside the missile plants had 
been moved and Iraqi technicians responsible for building missiles 
were at home in bed _ and not at the plants _ during the attacks. 
Iraq said that in addition to hitting missile factories, the bombardments 
struck colleges, post offices, dormitories, a museum and an oil refinery. 
``They want to ... strip Iraq of any serious industrial capabilities,'' 
Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad. ``This is a policy of hatred.'' 
But he contended that the United States and Britain failed to seriously 
harm the Iraqi government or military. ``They boasted of great success. 
... They lied,'' he said. Iraq's state-run newspapers also hit on 
that theme in editorials Tuesday. ``We came out victorious over the 
gang of the devil Butler, the clown Blair and the adulterer Clinton,'' 
said the daily Al-Iraq. The daily Al-Jumhuriya carried a headline 
saying ``Arab and international anger continues against the American-British 
crime,'' and the weekly Al-Ittihad said the anger was greatest among 
Muslims. Aziz reiterated Monday that Baghdad will not allow U.N. arms 
monitors to return, but chief weapons inspector Butler said it was 
up to the Security Council to decide the future of the inspectors. 
``It's not for Baghdad alone to make that declaration,'' Butler told 
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Tuesday.
