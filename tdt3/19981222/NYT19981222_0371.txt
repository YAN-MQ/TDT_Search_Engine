The New York Times said in an editorial Wednesday, Dec. 23: Few spectacles 
rival the Olympics for pomp and spectator interest. For some sports 
with few fans, the Olympics provide virtually the only major international 
exposure. Televised around the world, both the winter and summer Olympic 
Games can enhance the reputation of host cities. The organization 
behind the spectacles is the International Olympic Committee, a self-perpetuating 
group of 114 men and women that in turn is dominated by an executive 
committee of 11 people. In practice the executive committee chooses 
new members of the IOC and runs the organization. The principal duty 
of the full membership is to pick host cities. Now a member of the 
executive committee, Marc Hodler of Switzerland, has charged that 
there is widespread corruption in the choice of host cities. He said 
agents, one a member of the IOC, had promised to deliver blocs of 
IOC votes in return for favors from the aspiring cities. Most of the 
allegations are unproved, but organizers of the 2002 Winter Olympics 
in Salt Lake City admit they set up a $400,000 scholarship fund that 
benefited relatives of some IOC members, although they say it was 
a humanitarian gesture rather than bribery. Juan Antonio Samaranch, 
the president of the IOC since 1980, has proposed further concentrating 
power in the executive committee that he heads, by letting it instead 
of the full IOC membership pick the cities. Given that the executive 
committee and Samaranch were running the IOC when the alleged corruption 
was taking place, that is hardly a credible solution. The IOC could 
best clean up its act with some strong conflict-of-interest rules, 
setting forth exactly what is permissible. Samaranch said members 
would no longer be allowed to visit cities that were bidding. But 
it is hard to see how decisions could be made without some inspection. 
Instead, the IOC should restrict such visits and pay all expenses 
out of its own funds. Any city found to have violated the rules should 
be banned from holding the Olympics, and any IOC member found to have 
solicited such a violation would be expelled.
