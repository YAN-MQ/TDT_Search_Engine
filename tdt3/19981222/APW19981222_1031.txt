The Yugoslav war crimes on Tuesday announced that it has indicted 
two Bosnian Croats it holds responsible for a vicious campaign of 
terror unleashed in May 1993 that drove tens of thousands of Muslims 
out of the Bosnian city of Mostar. The southern city of Mostar was 
scene of some of the most savage fighting of the 3 1/2-year war in 
Bosnia and the city remains divided between Bosnian Croats and Muslims 
to this day. The U.N. court indicted Mladen Naletilic, 52, on 17 war 
crimes counts for allegedly commanding a paramilitary formation called 
the Convicts Battalion that was responsible for a string of atrocities 
against Muslims in and around Mostar from May 1993 until March 1994. 
Naletilic faces four charges of crimes against humanity, six of grave 
breaches of the Geneva Conventions and seven of breaches of the laws 
and customs of war. Also charged was 35-year old Vinko Martinovic, 
who prosecutors say commanded a sub unit of the Convicts Battalion 
called the Anti-Terrorsit Group. Martinovic faces 22 charges - five 
of crimes against humanity, eight grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions 
and nine of breaching the laws and customs of war. Exact details of 
the charges were not immediately released but the men are charged 
with personal participation in the atrocities and for commanding troops 
responsible for the campaign of persecution. Both men face maximum 
life sentences if convicted. Both are Bosnian Croats but also hold 
Croatian citizenship, the tribunal said in a press release. They are 
believed to have been arrested by Croat authorities and to be in custody 
in Zagreb. The tribunal did not immediately announce if plans had 
been made for their transfer to its high-security holding cells in 
The Hague. According to a summary of their indictment released late 
Tuesday by the U.N. court, the two were responsible for driving tens 
of thousands of Muslims out of Mostar. ``The means used for this purpose 
included killings, beatings, torture, evictions, destruction of cultural 
and religious heritage, looting, ... mass expulsions, detentions and 
imprisonments,'' prosecutors allege. All of the acts followed ``a 
pattern of systematic ethnic discrimination,'' the indictment added. 
Set up in 1993, the tribunal has indicted more than 50 war crimes 
suspects and has more than 20 in custody.
