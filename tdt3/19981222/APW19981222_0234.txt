A South Korean dissident has defected to North Korea, the communist 
country's state-run news agency reported Tuesday. Yoon Sung-shik, 
60, said he defected to the North because ``justice, progress, democracy 
and reunification of Koreas cannot be realized'' under the South Korean 
government, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said. 
About 200 North Koreans have escaped to South Korea in the past three 
years, reporting widespread hunger in the isolated country. But it 
is rare for a South Korean to defect to the North. The agency gave 
no details about Yoon's escape route. Seoul's government spy agency 
_ the Agency for National Security Planning _ said Yoon disappeared 
while visiting an unidentified third country to seek treatment for 
a heart ailment. The agency didn't elaborate. North Korea described 
Yoon as an active dissident leader, involved in four dissident groups. 
But the groups were considered minor in the South's dissident movement. 
Two of them confirmed that Yoon was a member but said they have little 
personal data on the man. The Korean Peninsula was divided into the 
communist North and capitalist South in 1945. The Koreas are technically 
still at war because their 1950-53 war ended with an armistice, not 
a peace treaty.
