Vice President Gore is calling on the Senate to find a fair and bipartisan 
compromise to the impeachment matter quickly. Today, he said senators 
should be the voice of "reason, deliberation, and healing that America 
needs." And, Mr. Gore spoke out against the house vote to impeach 
president clinton. I believe that Saturday's vote in the U.S. House 
of Representatives was wrong -- wrong for our constitution, and wrong 
for America. But this much should be clear. President Clinton and 
I will continue to focus all of our energies on the business of the 
American people.
