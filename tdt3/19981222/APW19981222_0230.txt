Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder denied reports that he has agreed to 
give German utilities at least 20 years to scrap nuclear power, but 
he made it clear the shutdown won't be quick. Schroeder's center-left 
government took power after September elections pledging to shut down 
Germany's 19 nuclear plants. But in an interview published Tuesday, 
Schroeder rejected pressure for a fast timetable from the environmentalist 
Greens, his junior government partner, and others. ``Some people's 
ideas of making it by 2004 are mistaken,'' he told the Westdeutsche 
Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. ``This will take significantly longer.'' 
He said he remains committed to seeking a shutdown strategy in talks 
with power companies starting next month. German media have reported 
that the two sides reached an understanding on a timetable in preliminary 
talks last week. Schroeder has said he could support 20 years, but 
one report said he had agreed to give power companies a longer grace 
period so they will renounce damage claims for lost earnings. Schroeder 
insisted there was no accord yet. ``I don't want to pin myself down 
on the time period,'' he told the newspaper.
