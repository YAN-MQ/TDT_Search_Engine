Hollywood actors may make a living creating fantasies, but they do 
have some real-life opinions about the impeachment process. Here's 
a sample. Good afternoon. Let me begin by -- It's good to stay apolitical 
I agree. That's show business as far as I'm concerned. I wouldn't 
want to be where he is right now, that's for sure. Democracy has been 
debased. Impeachment has been debased. In reality, I think he should 
be accountable in whatever way you would be accountable. Let me tell 
you, your lawyer would advise you to do the exact same thing, word 
for word, that he has done. I loath liars. I loath them. Liar. Liars. 
Every single crime that is committed between people starts with lying. 
Everything emanates from lying. I think he shouldn't be impeached. 
He should be censured. Censured, and then after he's done being president, 
I think he should go on trial for perjury. I don't think perjury is 
really the question here. I think what's happening is, is an attack 
on the power of the justice process. And the power of the state. And 
I think citizens have got to take a good hard look at how the power 
of the state is being handled. Now is a somber time, one which will 
impact the way future generations view not only the presidency, but 
our entire democratic system of government.
