Lord Soper, a Methodist minister and Britain's most famous soapbox 
orator for more than half a century, died Tuesday. He was 95. Soper 
had returned to his London home in the morning from the hospital where 
he was being treated for a chest infection and sat in his favorite 
chair before dying peacefully, the Methodist Church said. A lifelong 
supporter of radical causes, the Rev. Lord Soper had taken to his 
outdoor podium almost every week since 1926 _ at lunchtime Wednesdays 
on Tower Hill in east London, and at 3 p.m. Sundays at Speaker's Corner 
in Hyde Park. Soper thrived on give-and-take with hecklers as he expounded 
his Christian beliefs, and spoke out against war, poverty, drink, 
gambling, capitalism, communism, slave labor, racial inequality and 
capital punishment. He continued preaching into old age. ``I keep 
going because there are not many opportunities for personal confrontation 
anymore. They have all been swallowed up by public relations,'' he 
told The Times in 1991. '' The great thing about preaching is consistency,'' 
he added. ``Don't think I'm painting the holy hero, but people know 
that whatever the weather, I'll be there.' At the age of 90, Soper 
was still campaigning _ as president of the League Against Cruel Sports. 
Robert Key, a Conservative legislator, praised Soper lavishly after 
being told of his death, and added, ``I may have disagreed with almost 
all his politics, but I knew a good man when I saw one.'' Soper was 
made a life peer in 1965 for his work among the poor and homeless 
during a 40-year London ministry. Born Donald Oliver Soper into a 
Methodist family in south London, he was educated at Cambridge University 
and the London School of Economics, where he obtained his doctorate 
in philosophy. Shortly before beginning his ministry at the South 
London Mission in 1926, Soper was pastor at a chapel in London's East 
End. There, he started his weekly open air sermons on Tower Hill after 
arriving one lunchtime and asking a man sitting on the wall how to 
start a meeting. ``Get up on the wall and clap yer 'ands, guv'nor. 
They'll come,'' he was told. He did and soon had a crowd. For more 
than 65 years, in peace and war, whatever the weather, he got on the 
wall every Wednesday to harangue passers-by and workers for 90 minutes 
with his drill sergeant's voice and deadly wit. The weekly sermons 
became so well-known that when he married his wife, Marie, in 1929, 
the crowd at Tower Hill bought him a silver teapot. Soper began his 
Speakers' Corner orations in the early 1940s, attracting large congregtions 
despite competing for audiences with political extremists, cynics, 
cranks and believers of every religious and non-religious persuasion. 
On Saturdays, he conducted a service at Pentonville Prison, where 
he was chaplain, and on Sunday mornings, he preached to capacity crowds 
at Kingsway Hall, a Methodist mission. He was elected president of 
the Methodist Conference in 1953. From 1974 to 1978, he was chairman 
of Shelter, a charity for the homeless. In 1981, the World Methodist 
Council gave him its peace award. He is survived by four daughters, 
nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His wife, Lady Soper, 
died in 1994.
