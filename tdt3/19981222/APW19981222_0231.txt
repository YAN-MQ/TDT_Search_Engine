After carving up Bosnia's territory, the rival ethnic groups are now 
fighting over one of the country's cultural treasures _ a 600-year-old 
Jewish holy book. The Sarajevo Haggadah, handwritten on bleached calf-skin, 
dates back to the once-thriving Jewish community in Spain. A Haggadah 
tells the story of the exodus of the Jews from ancient Egypt, and 
Jews recite from the book during the Passover holiday. The 109-page 
Sarajevo Haggadah was carried to Italy in 1492 after King Ferdinand 
and Queen Isabella of Spain expelled the country's Jews. It was brought 
to Bosnia by a rabbi and handed down through his family until a descendant, 
Joseph Kohen, sold it to the National Museum in 1894. As such, the 
priceless manuscript belongs to the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The 1995 Dayton peace agreement, however, effectively partitioned 
the country along ethnic lines _ Serb, Muslim and Croat. Now the Bosnian 
Serbs are demanding one-third ownership of the Sarajevo Haggadah and 
are insisting that it be exhibited in Banja Luka, capital of their 
mini-state, every third year. In principle, the manuscript would also 
be exhibited every third year in Mostar, the unofficial Bosnian Croat 
capital. The Muslims would prefer the Haggadah be kept in what had 
been its traditional home _ the National Museum in Sarajevo. But the 
National Museum was heavily damaged during the wartime siege of Sarajevo, 
and the bullet-scarred Austro-Hungarian era structure has not been 
rebuilt. For now, the manuscript is kept in the vault of the National 
Bank. Jakob Finci, the head of Sarajevo's Jewish Community, wants 
the manuscript to remain in the national capital. Finci says Bosnian 
Serb and Bosnian Croat nationalists have a record of destroying cultural 
and religious monuments of rival groups during the 1992-1995 Bosnian 
war. ``They (the Serbs) blew up the Ferhadija, the others (the Croats) 
blew up the Old Bridge,'' Finci said, referring to an ancient mosque 
in Banja Luka and the world-renowned Ottoman bridge in Mostar, which 
were both more than 400 years old. ``Bosnia's body is, 11th graf pvs.
