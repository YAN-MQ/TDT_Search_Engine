The first full day of winter is bringing snow and freezing temperatures 
to parts of the United States. In Buffalo, New York, snow finally 
fell today after the city set a record for a lack of it. More snow 
is expected tomorrow. In Minnesota, temperatures dropped into the 
single digits, below zero in some areas. Westerly winds produced wind 
chills of 20 to 50 below zero in the extreme northeastern portion 
of the state. We'll have a look at the rest of the nation in the extended 
weather forecast. At 38 minutes past the hour.
