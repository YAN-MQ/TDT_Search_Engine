Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports." John Elway may have a Super Bowl 
ring, but he is winless against Dan marino. In just the second matchup 
between the two quarterbacks, Marino once again chalked up the better 
stats and the win over Denver, 31-21. He tossed four TDs on the night. 
Three to Lamar Thomas. The dolphins are in the playoffs. The way our 
defense played really caused our offense to step it up. We knew everybody 
had to play a good game to win tonight, because they're the best team 
in the league.
