America's top soldier paid a pre-Christmas visit to U.S. troops based 
in the northern Bosnian town of Tuzla on Tuesday and praised them 
for doing a ``superb job.'' U.S. Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited the some 6,900 American soldiers taking 
part in the 32,000-strong, NATO-led peacekeeping mission ``that is 
making a real difference in the lives of the people of Bosnia,'' Shelton 
told reporters. Shelton said it was a pleasure to get away from Washington 
for a while and to be back among soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, 
particularly at this time of year. ``With the holiday season upon 
us, I wanted to briefly visit our troops here in Bosnia and thank 
them for the great job they are doing,'' he said. Although the joint 
U.S. and British action in the Persian Gulf was in focus lately, Shelton 
reminded the troops that ``keeping Saddam Hussein in his box'' was 
just one of America's current military missions. He also praised the 
U.S. military involvement in Bosnia and said the troops will continue 
performing their ``magnificent job'' here, including continuing to 
arrest war-crimes suspects as the opportunities occur. ``America appreciates 
your sacrifice and your dedication,'' Shelton told the troops.
