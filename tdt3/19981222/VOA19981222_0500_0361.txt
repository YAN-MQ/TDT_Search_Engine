Israel's parliament has decided to bring Prime Minister Netanyahu's 
coalition government to an early end. It decided to call elections, 
which will be held in late April. Correspondent David Golles tells 
our Victor Morales that this has been in the wind for some time. The 
outcome was assured when Prime Minister Netanyahu's own Likud Party 
decided to support this move for new elections. The reason for that 
being that they were counting heads and realized that they stood to 
lose a no-confidence motion should that have been tabled. So now Israel 
is heading for new elections. They're talking -- the date for the 
election has not been settled. They're talking about April 27. And, 
in the meantime, the parties are gearing up for what should be a tough 
election fight. And, of course, the main issue will be the peace process 
with the Palestinians. Mr. Netanyahu maintains that his tough approach 
to the Palestinians is what gets results. And he's under harsh attack 
from left-wing parties who accuse him of essentially ruining both 
the peace process and, in the course of that, relationships with Washington. 
Well, David, you bring up the peace process. It's an important aspect 
of all of this. What does this mean for the peace process? It means, 
it would appear, that the peace process will be going nowhere between 
now and the elections. As you recall, last Friday, Mr. Netanyahu announced 
that he would not go ahead with Israel's scheduled withdrawal from 
another five percent of the West Bank. He obviously in this election 
campaign will be pitching to right-wing elements who either oppose 
the peace process outright or support it only on the most narrow terms. 
So it appears very unlikely that there'll be any further movement 
on the peace process until possibly the end of April. And the end 
of April is a very significant point since May 4 is the nominal exploration 
date for the Oslo Peace process. And, also on May 4, Yasser Afarat 
has been talking about unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state. 
So obviously this Israeli election will be fought over this very emotional 
issue as to whether Israel will, in effect, tolerate the declaration 
of a Palestinian State on May 4. That is VOA correspondent David Golles 
in Jerusalem. He spoke earlier with VOA's Victor Morales.
