Several thoughts floated around the Denver Broncos after Monday night's 
loss in Miami: ``It was the Dolphins fighting to make the playoffs 
and the fact we've already got home-field advantage in the bag, right? 
``We lost to Pittsburgh and San Francisco in consecutive games late 
in the year last year and then didn't lose again, all the way to the 
Super Bowl _ so this is OK, right? ``True, there is a little funk, 
we've lost a little edge, but we can recapture it, right? We won 13 
straight. We've lost two straight. What's the panic?'' Right? After 
Denver's 31-21 loss, there was plenty of speculation among the Broncos 
afterward about fires, putting some out and lighting others, within 
their ranks. There was talk of having one of those players-only meetings 
for later in the week. There was pressure. There was doubt. There 
was confidence. There was doubt again. This has to be their greatest 
fear: Goodness, have we peaked already? Mike Shanahan, Denver's head 
coach, told his players they were not making the plays they had made 
all season. He told them they had become accustomed to winning and 
maybe now they took it for granted. He warned them that mistakes would 
result in losing their edge for good. So, Denver tries to get it right. 
To peak at the right time. Not September. Not November. But in the 
playoffs. There is one regular-season game left for each team. For 
those that are already in the playoffs, how do you do it? How do you 
get there on a roll _ minus a flat tire? ``I watched some of the Denver-Miami 
game, and I saw a Miami team that felt like they had let a couple 
of games get away and they weren't going to let it happen again and 
turned up the intensity,'' said Dennis Green, the Minnesota Vikings' 
head coach. ``Denver is not running the ball well right now. Miami 
took advantage of that and really looks like a team that plays good 
defense and can be dangerous.'' Green talked about some of the teams 
that were peaking, getting hot at the right spot. Playoff time: ``The 
Jets have a running game, and they've only given up 256 points and 
they have the No. 2 home-field position in the AFC. The Jets are peaking. 
Green Bay is coming. They've got Dorsey Levens back and Brett Favre 
is back on track. They don't like what we're doing. They've got an 
attitude. Atlanta can run that ball.'' But when it comes to peaking, 
Green's Vikings lead the pack. With a 14-1 record and a final regular-season 
game left Saturday at Tennessee, the Vikings have been peaking all 
season. A victory over Tennessee would enable Minnesota to match the 
1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears as teams with 
15-1 records. The Vikings are fast and quick on defense, especially 
on artificial turf. They can stretch offenses with long, big gains 
on the ground with running back Robert Smith and in the air with rookie 
receiver Randy Moss. With 12 more points, they will break the record 
for points in a season _ 541 _ set by Washington in 1983. They have 
followed Green's plan for peaking in the playoffs to a tee. ``We talked 
at the very start of training camp about breaking the season into 
five phases,'' Green said. ``Our guys responded. And now that we are 
where we are, I don't want us to shut it down and try to save ourselves 
for the playoffs. Denver did that in '96. Kansas City did it in '97. 
Both of them never recovered. ``We are trying to be 15-1. I think 
what's helped us late in the year is we've played our final three 
games against AFC teams. We'll have played Baltimore, Jacksonville 
and Tennessee to end the regular season. We don't know those teams 
well. Our players know they have to pay attention because they aren't 
familiar with them. It's kept it interesting.'' Green has kept it 
interesting. At the beginning of the year, he contemplated walking 
away from the Vikings. The team's ownership was in turmoil, and _ 
with a season left on his contract _ the old ownership wanted Green 
to decide in January if he would stay or go and refused Green's demand 
for a contract extension. Green said he changed his mind ``four or 
five times'' before deciding on Super Bowl day, when Denver beat Green 
Bay for the championship, that he would stay. Later came new Vikings 
ownership in Red McCombs. A new contract for Green followed. Moss 
fell from the sky in the draft. Randall Cunningham dropped in at quarterback 
and soared. Green had a good thing. How would he keep it going, especially 
come playoff time? ``You adapt,'' Green said. ``You take it phase 
by phase. You know your team. You have short goals, but you keep big 
goals in mind.'' It is the old scheme of planning your work and working 
your plan. It is having the right players not only in talent but also 
in mindset. It is focus. It is luck. ``Even if we get to 15-1, there 
are a lot of good teams out there that won't be 15-1,'' Green said. 
``There are some teams right now peaking that are making it good for 
themselves.'' Denver thinks it can get back on track. Miami is hot 
for now. The Jets deserve a look. Green Bay and Atlanta are hitting 
their stride. Others plan a playoff peak and to surprise. But if Green's 
Vikings make it all the way, win the whole show on Super Bowl day, 
it would be a year to the day that he decided to stay in Minnesota. 
Timing is everything.
