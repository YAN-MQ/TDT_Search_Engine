The early release of three Irish Republican Army prisoners, from a 
Dublin jail, has sparked outrage from police and the families of the 
IRA's victims. The three men were released this morning, after serving 
less than half their sentences for murdering police officers. A fourth 
man is to be released on Wednesday. Supporters of the early release 
program say it's an essential part of the peace accords signed between 
pro-British Unionists, and pro-Irish Nationalists, in April. Critics 
of the program say early releases should be linked to IRA disarmament. 
The critics also say the most violent offenders should be released 
last.
