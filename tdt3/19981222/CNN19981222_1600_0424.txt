Thousands of gas stations across the country will be forced to shut 
down, at midnight tonight. That's when the federal government begins 
enforcing a nationwide order to replace or upgrade outdated underground 
storage tanks. The requirements were announced ten years ago, but 
the EPA says about 20,000 gas stations will miss the deadline and 
must shut down their pumps until they comply. The regulations affect 
all businesses with underground fuel tanks and are aimed at preventing 
spills and leaks that can poison groundwater.
