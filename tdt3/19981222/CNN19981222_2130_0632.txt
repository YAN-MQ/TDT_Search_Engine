Today is the deadline for service stations to comply with an environmental 
regulation. They are supposed to install leak proof, underground gasoline 
tanks. The deadline was set ten years ago after some leaking tanks 
contaminated drinking water. Stations that don't comply can be fined 
or shut down. Many people complain the rules will drive mom and pop 
stations out of business. Already, some of them have closed rather 
than pay upwards of $100,000 for the new tank.
