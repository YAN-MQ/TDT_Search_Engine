Exiled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng on Tuesday praised Taiwanese 
lawmakers for contributing to the island's democracy by replacing 
once-notorious brawls with serious debate. Visiting the Legislature 
on the second day of his first trip to Taiwan, Wei said mainland authorities 
had cited pandemonium at the island's parliament as proof that democracy 
could not take hold in a Chinese society. But Wei noted Taiwan's democracy 
has since matured and ``even brawls are much better than a closed 
society where you could not express your views.'' ``More mainlanders 
now realize the unanimous votes being taken at our National Peoples' 
Congress are false,'' he said. Wei was released from a Chinese prison 
last year after spending much of the last 18 years in a cell for championing 
democracy in China. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao 
said Wei is a ``criminal on medical parole'' who should not be used 
for political purposes. ``China cannot adopt completely direct elections 
because it is so large, has large regional and cultural differences,'' 
Zhu said at a briefing. ``So for the mainland to adopt a Taiwan-style 
democracy is not practical.'' Wei won the support of many Taiwanese 
after appearing at a news conference Monday to call on Chinese authorities 
to respect the right of Taiwan to choose formal independence. Wei, 
however, also exhibited his pragmatism by urging Taiwanese to ``exercise 
their right not to declare independence'' as long as China threatens 
to invade. Taipei and Beijing were split politically amid civil war 
in 1949. Taiwan's ruling Nationalists say the island's peaceful transition 
to democracy over the last decade should be a model for China, but 
they have generally distanced themselves from exiled Chinese dissidents, 
many of whom uphold China's nationalism and its claim to Taiwan. The 
United Daily News, a major Taiwanese newspaper, said Wei's visit could 
be an important step in fostering dialog between the people of Taiwan 
and China. ``Democracy can become a topic of such dialogue,'' the 
newspaper said in an editorial. ``Taiwan should play a more positive 
role in helping mainlanders to strive for their political freedom 
... and thus help itself in reaching a new relationship'' with China, 
it said.
