Four Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted to 
impeach President Clinton are asking the U.S. Senate to consider censuring 
Mr. Clinton rather than convicting him. The Republican proposal follows 
a statement by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd warning the White House 
not to attempt brokering a censure deal with the Senate. He said any 
censure agreement should be made solely among solo members -- Senate 
members that is -- and without White House interference.
