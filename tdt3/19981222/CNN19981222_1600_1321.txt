Now, staying in the AFC, Miami wrapped up the final playoff berth 
as Dan marino threw four touchdown passes, three to Lamar Thomas. 
The dolphins downed Denver, 31-21. The stellar dolphin D picked John 
Elway off twice, and held Terrell Davis to just 29 yards rushing. 
The letdown we've had over the past five games has finally caught 
up with us the past two. And we're not able to overcome the mistakes, 
we're not making the plays that we did in the beginning of the season. 
And unfortunately, it's catching up with us and we're losing ball 
games. But, you know, we're not gonna panic. You know, the way our 
defense played, it really caused our offense to step it up.
