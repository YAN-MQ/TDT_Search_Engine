In the wake of the British and U.S. bombing of Iraq, France proposed 
Tuesday that the United Nations set up a new system for monitoring 
Iraq's arms programs and let it export oil, but make sure none of 
the revenue is used to buy weapons. In an interview, Foreign Minister 
Hubert Vedrine said: ``We think that seven years of monitoring by 
the U.N. Special Commission, plus the strikes that have taken place, 
have created a new situation. ``The objective we all have in the Security 
Council is for Iraq not to become a danger again, and with everything 
that has been inspected and monitored, and all that has been destroyed, 
we think we can move from inspecting the past, so to speak, to making 
the future safer.'' ``We think that should be done by the Security 
Council because its authority and its role have been put at a disadvantage,'' 
he said, echoing criticism by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in parliament 
of the way the British and U.S. bombing had bypassed the Security 
Council. ``The United States itself speaks of unity being necessary 
in the Security Council,'' Vedrine said. ``If we really think the 
Security Council is important, we have to make it the key player again.'' 
Asked to explain French ideas for a new system of U.N. monitoring, 
first called for by President Jacques Chirac on Sunday after the bombing 
ended, Vedrine said: ``First, we need a system of surveillance of 
arms, to verify that Iraq doesn't have more arms than it is allowed 
and doesn't embark again on a policy of acquiring weapons of mass 
destruction. We don't pretend to have a detailed plan worked out, 
and we'll have to talk with all our partners in the Security Council. 
But there should be both technical means, cameras, etc., and on-the-spot 
inspections, but we think that can't be done by the U.N. Special Commission 
in its present form the way it has been done in the past.'' Asked 
whether, like Russia, France believed that the commission's head, 
Richard Butler, should be replaced, Vedrine did not answer directly. 
``The question of personalities has been posed by several members 
of the Security Council, particularly by Russia, quite clearly, but 
I think you have to consider the question of personalities as a function 
of the job that has to be performed,'' he said. ``Second,'' he went 
on, ``our thinking is that if we can agree on an effective system 
of continuous monitoring, one that provides adequate guarantees, we 
should be able to lift the embargo on Iraqi oil sales _ I'm not saying 
lift all the sanctions, there are other sanctions besides oil, and 
that's another problem.'' But, he said, ``The oil embargo has already 
been modified with the petroleum-for-food program. What happens to 
revenue from those sales is quite closely monitored, making sure they 
are used for the population and not for buying arms, for example. 
It shouldn't be that much more complicated to monitor the revenue 
from sales if the oil embargo is lifted. That's a sensitive issue, 
it's not something the Iraqis want.'' ``We haven't made detailed proposals, 
we're simply in the process of discussion,'' said Vedrine, who has 
been on the telephone in the past two days with Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. ``We 
have expressed some ideas, but we think it has to be discussed with 
our Security Council partners,'' he said. Other French officials said 
controls could include monitoring Iraqi ports of entry to make sure 
that foreign goods bought with oil revenues were only those permitted 
by U.N. resolutions. Asked whether France disagreed with the U.S. 
view that international sanctions would not work as long as President 
Saddam Hussein remained in power, Vedrine said even the United States 
seemed to have little political leverage inside Iraq. But he dismissed 
Iraq's public rejection of the French proposals as premature. ``It's 
too early for discussions with Iraq,'' he said. ``We know what Iraq 
wants, the lifting of all the sanctions, without anything in return. 
Nobody supports that idea, not even the Russians.'' And he said France 
did not believe diplomacy would be cut short, at least not immediately, 
by renewed American bombing. ``The two approaches are mutually exclusive,'' 
he said. ``But more bombing doesn't seem about to happen now. Why 
would it? What would be the objective? What we're dealing with is 
a political posture taken by the United States, which always insists 
that it has the right to take action if it decides to do so, but it's 
not something that seems likely again at the moment. ``We need a period 
of reflection, in all our capitals. Everybody should develop their 
own ideas about what to do. I think after that, we need bilateral 
consultations among various members of the Security Council, and later 
a more formal discussion in the Security Council.'' But, he concluded, 
``Iraq is not a bigger risk today than it was in 1990, or five years 
ago. It's impossible to believe that.''
