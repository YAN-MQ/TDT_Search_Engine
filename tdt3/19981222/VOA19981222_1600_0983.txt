A little bit higher up, the U.S. space agency, NASA, has reestablished 
contact with an unmanned spacecraft headed for a rendezvous with a 
giant asteroid, 340 million kilometers from earth. NASA lost contact, 
Sunday, with the space craft, during an engine maneuver to slow the 
orbital on its approach to the asteroid known as Eros. Flight controllers, 
Tuesday, were able to reestablish two-way communication. The spacecraft 
had been scheduled to enter the orbit of Eros on January 10th. However, 
a mission official says this will be delayed until at least February 
6th while technicians work to understand what caused the loss of contact. 
Scientists want to study the composition and density of Eros, to learn 
how asteroids helped form the planets and possibly, how to divert 
one from hitting earth.
