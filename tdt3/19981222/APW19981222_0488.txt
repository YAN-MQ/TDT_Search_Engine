The United Nations mission removed two Bosnian Serb police officers 
from their duties for involvement in the torture and ill-treatment 
of suspects and witnesses, officials said Tuesday. On Dec. 18, Momir 
Vukovic and Spasoje Camur were removed from their duties and lost 
their certification to work as police in Bosnia's Serb republic, Kelly 
Moore, spokeswoman for the U.N. Mission in Bosnia said Tuesday. Three 
other men who were involved in the wrongdoings, but who no longer 
work as policemen were also stripped of their qualifications. The 
five were involved in the investigation of 14 persons who were detained 
in August in connection with the killing of Srdjan Knezevic, local 
police chief of Pale. Knezevic had switched his loyalties from No. 
1 war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic to more moderate leaders. International 
officials launched their own investigation of the arrest, under suspicions 
that the 14 detainees were being mistreated. According to Moore, they 
found Vukovic and Camur had direct knowledge the 14 were being hidden 
and tortured for up to 10 days. The acts committed by these police 
officers constitutes gross misconduct and seriously violates international 
human rights standards, as well as democratic policing principles, 
Moore said. In September, U.N. officials also stripped Ljubisa Savic, 
former chief of the Bosnian Serb's uniformed police, of his qualifications 
for direct engagement in, and supervision of the torture and ill-treatment 
of the detainees. The U.N. has demanded that a criminal investigation 
be initiated against these officers and will closely monitor this 
procedure too. Since 1995, the United Nations has been involved in 
implementing the peace in post-war Bosnia, including the certification 
of all police officers employed by the state. Once stripped of their 
qualifications, the officers are barred from ever exercising police 
powers again anywhere in the country.
