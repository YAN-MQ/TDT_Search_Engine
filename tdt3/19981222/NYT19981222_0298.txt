A U.S. judge on Tuesday placed tighter restrictions on the movements 
of Yah Lin Trie, an Arkansas restaurateur who has been indicted on 
campaign fund-raising charges, after it was learned that Trie had 
applied for a Taiwanese passport. Judge Paul Friedman of U.S. District 
Court ordered that Trie, also known as Charlie, report twice a week 
in person to a court officer in Norfolk, Va., and that until his trial 
date he be subject to a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. The curfew will 
be enforced by random calls to the home in Virginia Beach, Va., where 
he is living with his sister. Trie, a Taiwanese-born naturalized citizen 
and a longtime friend of President Clinton, was indicted in November 
on a charge of obstructing a Senate investigation into accusations 
of campaign fund-raising abuses during the president's 1996 re-election 
campaign. Trie left the United States in late 1996 rather than testify 
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, but returned voluntarily 
last February and pleaded not guilty to federal campaign finance charges. 
At the time of his return, Trie had surrendered his American and Taiwanese 
passports. But in December, without telling the Justice Department, 
the court or his own lawyers, he applied for a new Taiwanese passport, 
telling officials in Taiwan that his was lost. An assistant U.S. attorney, 
Geoffrey Hobart, said this could have been a step in preparation for 
fleeing the country, and he urged Friedman to revoke Trie's bail. 
Trie's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, said that since his client's return 
from Taiwan in February, Trie had scrupulously adhered to the conditions 
of his bail, even traveling back and forth without incident to Taiwan 
twice to visit his ailing wife, who subsequently died. ``His actions 
are not indicative of a man who is about to flee,'' Weingarten said. 
``It's indicative of a man whose life has been shattered.'' In a court 
ruling involving another Democratic fund-raiser, another federal judge 
here on Tuesday ordered John Huang, the former Commerce Department 
official and fund-raiser, to give more testimony in a four-year-old 
civil case brought by a conservative public interest group that accuses 
the department of selling seats on its trade missions in exchange 
for donations to the Democratic Party. The department has denied the 
accusations, which were made by Judicial Watch Inc. as part of a lawsuit 
it filed seeking documents from the department under the Freedom of 
Information Act. On Tuesday, Judge Royce Lamberth of U.S. District 
Court found that the department had engaged in a pattern of misconduct, 
including the ``destruction of potentially responsive documents'' 
in the office of the late Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown ``and elsewhere,'' 
the ``illegal withholding of responsive documents in the removal of 
such documents from'' the Commerce Department, and ``a great deal 
of misconduct during the litigation, which the court leaves for another 
day's decision.'' Lamberth also scolded the department for failing 
to investigate its own misconduct.
