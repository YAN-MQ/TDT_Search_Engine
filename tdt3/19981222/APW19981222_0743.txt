A Jewish group criticized a German court Tuesday for granting World 
War II veterans' disability benefits to two former Nazi SS members. 
The Simon Wiesenthal Center said the verdict seems to contradict an 
amendment passed last year by parliament that allows courts to strip 
veterans of disability rights if they ``violated the principles of 
humanity or the law'' during the Third Reich. ``It was our understanding 
that any person who served in the SS or in others units which carried 
out crimes against civilians fell under that category,'' Efraim Zuroff, 
the center's director for Israel, said in a statement. The Federal 
Social Court in Kassel last week overturned lower court rulings that 
had denied benefits to two Latvians who served in the elite Waffen 
SS during World War II. The court said membership in the Waffen SS 
by itself was not a valid reason for Germany to strip a World War 
II veteran of benefits. It sent the case back to a lower court. A 
court spokeswoman refused to give details of the case, including the 
men's identities.
