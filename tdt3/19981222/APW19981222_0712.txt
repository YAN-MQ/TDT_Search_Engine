Croatian president Franjo Tudjman and members of the Bosnian presidency 
ceremonially opened on Tuesday a newly built bridge on the River Sava, 
the natural border between the two countries. The 790-meter (2600-feet) 
long bridge, linking Zupanja in eastern Croatia, and Orasje in northeastern 
Bosnia, provides Bosnia with a vital northern link to Croatia, and 
further on to Europe. The new bridge was a joint venture between Bosnian 
and Croatian companies, who worked on it for 18 months. The World 
Bank provided the dlrs 6.5 million loan, which two countries will 
repay together. Shelling by Serb rebels destroyed the previous bridge. 
Its replacement now connects Croatia with the Muslim-Croat federation 
in Bosnia, with the Serb republic just (kilometers) miles away. Speaking 
at the opening Tudjman said the new bridge symbolizes the beginning 
of the ``peacetime era, which paves the way for progress and peaceful 
coexistence'' of all three ethnic groups in Bosnia. ``The reality 
is such that Croats, Muslims and Serbs live in this area and they 
should find solutions to live together and avoid conflicts,'' state-run 
HINA news agency quoted Tudjman as saying. Tudjman has been widely 
accused of seeking to annex Croat-controlled parts of Bosnia to Croatia 
proper. Although he publicly supports the 1995 Dayton peace accord, 
which envisaged the Bosnian state within its pre-war borders, many 
suspect that his intentions in fact remain unchanged. On Tuesday, 
he pointed out that the bridge ``connects two parts of the same nation,'' 
referring evidently to Bosnian Croats, who make the majority in the 
Orasje area.
