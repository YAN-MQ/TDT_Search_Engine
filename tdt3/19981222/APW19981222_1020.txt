The American Basketball League suspended operations on Tuesday, unable 
to stem its financial losses in the third season of the women's league. 
The league, which announced the move in a telephone recording, by 
fax and on its Web site, said it would file for protection under Chapter 
11 of the federal bankruptcy code. The decision leaves the WNBA as 
the lone U.S. professional women's basketball league. The nine-team 
ABL was about a third of the way through this season when its board 
of directors decided to halt operations Monday night. The league had 
franchises in Chicago; Colorado; Columbus, Ohio; Nashville, Tennessee; 
Hartford, Connecticut; Philadelphia; Portland, Oregon; San Jose; and 
Seattle. Two franchises, in Long Beach, California and Atlanta, had 
folded earlier because of poor attendance. The WNBA signed most of 
this year's top college seniors and was able to lure Dawn Staley, 
one of the ABL's main attractions. Standout guard Jen Rizzotti agreed 
to stay with the New England Blizzard of the ABL after speaking to 
the WNBA. The Columbus Quest won titles in the league's only two complete 
seasons. The ABL began in 1996 with eight teams and a 40-game schedule. 
It expanded to nine teams in its second season, with attendance increasing 
23 percent. The television package included 36 games on Fox Sports 
Net and BET.
