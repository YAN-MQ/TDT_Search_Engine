It all started when Anthony Drazan decided to find out how the other 
half learned. ``I wanted to study acting,'' Drazan recalled recently, 
easing into a long conversation in the dark lobby cafe of a hotel 
on Manhattan's Central Park South. After directing two well-received 
films, ``Zebrahead'' and ``Imaginary Crimes,'' in the early 90s, he 
felt a need for a deeper understanding of what transpired on his set 
as the camera rolled, a desire to puzzle out the meaning of the moment 
when an actor lets down his guard and begins to speak in other people's 
words. So in 1995, Drazan, a thoughtful, gregarious man who carefully 
ruminates over his own words, enrolled in a Los Angeles acting class. 
``And the first scene I did,'' Drazan said, ``was from `Hurlyburly.' 
'' A performer wasn't born that day _ ``I did that scene about as 
poorly as I could,'' he said _ but a movie was. Once the director 
became immersed in David Rabe's scathing 1984 play about the volatile 
lives of a group of Hollywood bottom-feeders, he couldn't let go. 
Within months, he was on a plane to see Rabe in northwest Connecticut 
and try to get his consent to make ``Hurlyburly'' the movie, an idea 
the playwright had twice rejected in the past. The proposal by Drazan, 
however, seemed more heartfelt to the leery Rabe. ``The key thing 
was I could feel his personal involvement with the movie,'' Rabe recalled. 
``I said yeah.'' After an exhausting three-year odyssey comes the 
all-star ``Hurlyburly'' that opened Friday in New York and Los Angeles 
for a weeklong run to qualify for the Oscar race, before a nationwide 
release in January. Made a year ago on a puny budget of $4 million, 
a sum that no doubt would have had the movie's jaded industry types 
in stitches, ``Hurlyburly'' features a powerhouse ensemble that includes 
Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Meg Ryan, Anna Paquin, Chazz Palminteri, 
Robin Wright Penn and Garry Shandling, playing an assortment of shallow, 
self-absorbed, cocaine-snorting, hair-trigger-tempered opportunists 
alternately indulging in and resisting their basest impulses. ``Hurlyburly'' 
is not your typical shimmering Christmas flick: The story, filled 
with moments of acidic humor, is a withering depiction of male friendship, 
and a fairly brutal portrait of the ways men use and abuse the opposite 
sex. Analyzing the original stage version in 1984, Frank Rich of The 
New York Times called it ``shocking in its refusal to observe any 
recent cease-fires in the war between men and women.'' The script, 
written by the playwright and the director, may have been an actor's 
delight, but it was a producer's albatross. Even after the signing 
of the formidable Penn, who appeared in a production of the play in 
1988 at the Westwood Playhouse in Los Angeles, and the expression 
of interest by the Oscar-winning Spacey, Drazan and Rabe still had 
little luck finding financial backing. ``When I decided to form a 
partnership with Tony to make the movie, my lawyer was saying, `Why 
are you becoming a partner with him?' '' said Rabe, a protege of the 
Public Theater impresario, Joseph Papp, and the author of several 
hit plays in the 1970s and 80s, among them ``Streamers'' and ``Sticks 
and Bones.'' ``But my thought was, if this ever will be a movie, Tony 
will have earned his money.'' Backing was eventually obtained through 
the sale of foreign rights and the actors worked for minimal salaries. 
Fine Line Features later bought the domestic rights to the finished 
film, completed in 30 days of shooting in the Hollywood Hills. The 
difficulties the filmmakers encountered may say something about the 
treacherous climate in Hollywood these days for movies that attempt, 
even in the broadest ways, to portray the darker aspects of the film 
business. At least superficially, ``Hurlyburly'' deals with images 
of itself that the movie industry probably prefers not to have advertised, 
particularly drug-taking; the coke in ``Hurlyburly'' flows as freely 
as, well, Coke. Some advance viewers have already been made profoundly 
uncomfortable by the portrayal of women. Ms. Paquin's Donna, for instance, 
a young drifter who survives on her precocious knack for pleasuring 
men, is handled by her minders as a valueless object. She is brought 
by Artie, played by Shandling, to the house in the Hollywood Hills 
that Penn's Eddie shares with his friend and partner, Spacey's Mickey, 
and offered as a gift. ``You can keep her,'' Shandling tells them. 
``Like a CARE package.'' Rabe, his thick, snow-white hair virtually 
aglow in the dim hotel cafe, laughed wearily at how literally his 
characters were taken by some famous actors he and Drazan approached 
with parts in the film. It seemed as if some mistook ``Hurlyburly'' 
for a documentary expose. ``There was one turndown where the guy said: 
`I used to treat women this way; I don't anymore,' '' Rabe recalled. 
A potential investor said no, too, because of the depiction of drug 
use. ``He didn't want to take it on because his boss' son was in rehab.'' 
The writer and the director profess bewilderment at the defensive 
reaction to ``Hurlyburly.'' Rabe's characters, principally Eddie and 
Mickey, have all of what the outside world views as the trappings 
of industry insider-dom: countless cellular phones, obscure European 
sports cars, undiscoverable sources of income. And yet show business 
is only a backdrop for the story, which focuses more intensively on 
the interior struggles of Rabe's troubled men. ``Hurlyburly'' is no 
attempt to outdo ``The Player,'' Robert Altman's highly specific back-lot-and-front-office 
satire; in fact, audiences never even learn what exactly Eddie and 
Mickey do in the business (there's one brief office scene, in which 
Penn and Spacey inscrutably pore over actors' 8-by-10 glossies). Still, 
Drazan said, he and the film's production designer, Michael Haller 
(who died shortly after filming), were determined to be meticulous 
about conjuring the humdrum surfaces of movieland. In a film so much 
concerned with facades, they made their motif ``the everyday L.A. 
that the people in the Hills experience _ the dry cleaners, the for-sale 
signs in front of every house.'' A scene in a cemetery, where one 
of Eddie's and Mickey's friends is being laid to rest, is shot so 
that the Paramount studio water tower is visible in the distance. 
Rabe's play has been artfully reimagined. Haller's gadget-filled Los 
Angeles interiors and unflattering exteriors _ never have the Hollywood 
Hills looked so unglamorous _ skillfully illuminate Rabe's sleazy 
types; it's as if someone had torn away the shiny tile and exposed 
the roaches crawling in the plumbing. This is the territory of hungry 
men on the make, sloppy in their household affairs and even more careless 
in their handling of other people. Their cars and cell phones, in 
which and on which they virtually live, define the limited range of 
their imaginations; in one witty sequence, Eddie and Mickey begin 
an argument (over a woman) in the ugly house they share and seamlessly 
continue it on their car phones as they zig and zag on winding roads 
to the office they also happen to share. Drazan's introduction to 
``Hurlyburly,'' that scene in acting class, provided him with a window 
into Rabe's work. ``It was the French-Chinese restaurant scene,'' 
he said, referring to a fight between Eddie and his wavering girlfriend 
Darlene (played in the movie by Penn's wife, Robin Wright Penn), over 
whether to have dinner in a French or Chinese restaurant. Darlene 
says she has no preference, she likes them both, but Eddie, in the 
perfect irrationality of couples' confrontations, turns her fence-straddling 
into an emotional opera. ``But they're different,'' he screams. ``One 
is French, and the other is Chinese.'' Darlene is unmoved. ``Not in 
my inner emotional subjective experience of them,'' she shouts back. 
It was through the humor and the universal truths uncovered in that 
interlude _ ``There was no bottom in that scene,'' he said admiringly 
_ that Drazan fell in love with ``Hurlyburly.'' Now, he and Rabe have 
their fingers crossed that audiences, too, will see in their movie 
worlds beyond the twists and turns of Mulholland Drive.
