Probably the only place busier than the mall this holiday season is 
the airport. There may be no need to fight the crowds twice. Dan Ronan 
reports, some airports are doubling as shopping hubs. These silk neckties 
would look perfect under the tree. And if you're flying, you don't 
have far to go to buy them. As newer airports are built and others 
are remodeled, they're looking more like upscale shopping malls. They 
want high-end restaurants, they want high-end retail. Steve reise 
is an architect who's helped redesign many of the nation's older airports. 
They really want to have the same level of service and the same type 
of amenities that they would have if they would go to nationally recognized 
shopping malls. In recent years, Reagan national airport in Washington, 
the greater Pittsburgh airport and Atlanta's hartsfield are just a 
few of the facilities that have undergone multibillion-dollar renovations. 
But the prices you pay have gone down and are now often competitive 
with malls. So is the selection. We realize that brands are a very 
important part of how customers or passengers are influenced. And 
so now, we are carrying better brands and offering better service 
and hopefully pleasing the customer. And the food is improving, too. 
Because of price-gouging and lack of competition at many airports, 
five years ago, you'd pay $8 for a cold hot dog and a warm drink. 
Now, they have nicer restaurants where you can get a good meal and 
sit down. And after you're done, it's just a short walk across the 
concourse to go shopping. So for busy travelers hustling from one 
plane to the next, the best place to get your last-minute gifts may 
be at the airport. Dan Ronan, CNN, Atlanta.
