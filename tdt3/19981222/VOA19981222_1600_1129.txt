Former U.S. presidential candidate and civil rights activist, Jesse 
Jackson, has offered to mediate a dispute between NBA players and 
owners as the lockout continues. Reverend Jackson says that he wants 
to keep the lines of communication open between Commissioner David 
Stern, and the owners. Mr. Jackson says he has tried to contact several 
players and union head, Billy Hunter, but his calls have not been 
returned. The NBA locked players out on July 1st because of a dispute 
over revenues. So far 567...... could start this January 25th. The 
league has also canceled the All-star game, and more than $525 million 
in players' salaries have been lost.
