Meanwhile, a divided U.N. Security Council resumes closed-door talks 
today on how to go forward in eliminating Iraq's banned weapons of 
mass destruction. The talks follow last week's U.S.-led air strikes 
against Iraq triggered by its failure to cooperate with U.S. inspectors 
searching for bad weapons. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan says 
he hopes today's talks will bring all council members together on 
the Iraq issue. Of the five permanent members, Russia, China, and 
France all favor easing U.S. sanctions against Iraq. While a move 
-- it is not a move favored by the United States and Britain.
