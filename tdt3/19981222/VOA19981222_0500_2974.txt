Share prices in Tokyo tumbled over 2.5% today, with the benchmark 
DK average closing below 14,000 for the first time in about two months. 
The index shed 373 points. Prices closed sharply lower on selling 
by institutional investors, especially financial institutions following 
a steep decline in bond prices. Australian, Taiwan, Philippine shares 
all closed higher. Hong Kong shares ended the day off seven-tenths 
of one percent. The dollar strengthened against the Yen in early Europe 
trading from its late Monday New York quote of 116.23 Yen.
