A bomb exploded Tuesday just after Mass in a Roman Catholic church 
in Pakistan, damaging the building and slightly wounding one worshipper. 
The bomb exploded in Saint Patrick's Cathedral in the southern port 
of Karachi minutes after the end of Mass, sending 100 worshippers 
rushing from the front of the church, witnesses said. The injured 
woman was taken to a private hospital. Her condition was not known. 
Police said the explosion damaged the inside of the 120-year-old church. 
The timed device, containing 200 grams of explosive material, was 
hidden under a bench in the main hall, said the chief of Karachi's 
bomb disposal squad, Moinuddin, who uses only one name. No group has 
claimed responsibility of the attack. Religious minorities in Pakistan 
often complain of persecution and attacks by the extremist Muslim 
religious groups. Dozens of Christians have died in recent years in 
attacks by Muslim extremists. Police beefed-up security at all the 
churches and Christian localities in Karachi after the explosion. 
``It is a terrorist act ahead of Christmas,'' said Shafique Paracha, 
a Karachi civil service commissioner.
