NATIONAL FORECAST For the first time since early November, the vast 
majority of the nation will be unseasonably cold. Only southern Florida 
will average above normal temperatures. The core of the frigid air 
will be over the northern Plains with another mound of gelid air trapped 
in the valleys of the central Rockies. High pressure stretching from 
the Northeast coast to the interior Northwest will sponsor dry weather 
for most sections. Winds will be much gentler in New England. A push 
of fresh polar air across the Great Lakes will trigger more snow squalls 
on eastern shores of Lakes Michigan, Erie and Ontario. The heaviest 
snow should fall on the Tug Hill plateau of central New York. Flurries 
will continue in the mountains of New England. Jet stream winds from 
the Southwest will direct a disturbance from the western Gulf States 
toward the Middle Atlantic region. A veil of clouds will stream northeast 
into the Ohio Valley and across the central Appalachians. Patches 
of light snow will develop from the northern Ozarks to central West 
Virginia. Accumulations should be less than two inches. A swath of 
icy rain will lead to hazardous travel from northeast Texas across 
the Tennessee Valley and into central Virginia and North Carolina. 
A chill rain will dampen parts of the Gulf Coast. Winds ascending 
the southern Rockies will produce light snow in the Four Corners region, 
otherwise the West will be bright and very cold. Clouds will arrive 
in the Northwest as a warm front approaches from the North Pacific. 
Showers will develop along the coast later on. Focus: Clockwork Within 
the first two hours of astronomical winter, two records were established 
in the middle of the nation. At Indianapolis, snow began falling at 
9:44 p.m. on Monday evening, marking the first and latest occurrence 
of snowflakes in that city. In fact, the previous latest date was 
December 7, 1994. An hour later in Little Rock, Ark., the mercury 
fell to freezing for the first time since March 13, ending the longest 
growing season in that area at 283 days. Both events just happened 
to coincide with the traditional beginning of the new season and both 
cities will remain locked in wintry chill Wednesday with well below 
seasonal readings.
