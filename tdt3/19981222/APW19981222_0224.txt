About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers, evacuated from Iraq last week 
during U.S.-British air attacks, left Amman on Tuesday to return to 
the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Before departing, many in the group were 
smiling and taking photos of each other in front of the buses that 
will take them on the more than 12-hour journey across the desert. 
``We are very happy to be going back to take up our work in Iraq,'' 
Darleen Biseau said as she boarded one of the three buses making the 
journey, along with eight four-wheel-drive cars. The U.N. workers 
had left the Iraqi capital on the second day of the airstrikes on 
Iraq. Biseau, who works on the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program 
in Baghdad, had described her trip to Amman on arrival Saturday as 
a journey the U.N. workers made with tears for the people they left 
behind. She said the bombardment would add to the suffering of Iraqis. 
She said she was ``hoping for the best'' in returning. Abdullah Odeh, 
resident representative in Amman for the U.N. Development Program, 
said all the agency personnel who left Baghdad except those on holiday 
leaves were returning to ``pick up the pieces'' of their work. ``They 
will continue the mission they are there for, which is the full humanitarian 
mission,'' he added. The oil-for-food program is an exception to punishing 
trade sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait. It allows Iraq to sell limited quantities 
of oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million people. 
Most of the U.N. workers departing Amman refused to talk to reporters. 
The workers were evacuated after spending the first night of the airstrikes 
last Thursday huddled in their headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad. 
Those who had remained in Baghdad were special U.N. envoy Prakash 
Shah, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans von Sponeck, and 26 other 
U.N. workers. Meanwhile, a statement issued by the U.N. humanitarian 
spokesman in New York, John Mills, said that the flow of food and 
medicine into Iraq resumed Monday via Umm Qasr in southern Iraq and 
were to restart at the Jordanian and Syrian borders on Tuesday. Through 
the airstrikes, the border crossings between Turkey and Kurdish areas 
in northern Iraq remained open, the statement said. It also confirmed 
earlier reports that oil exports had continued normally via the southern 
Iraqi port of Al-Bakr and the Turkish port of Ceyhan. It said the 
value of oil exported since the beginning of fifth phase of the oil-for-food 
program on Nov. 26 was about dlrs 172 million. The program allows 
Iraq to sell dlrs 5.2 billion dollars worth of oil in a six-month 
period to buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million people. 
But the government has said that low world oil prices and problems 
stepping up production at its badly maintained oil facilities won't 
allow it to meet the sales target.
