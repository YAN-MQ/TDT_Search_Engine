NEW YORK _ ``Santa needs help,'' Juan Lebron shouted to the people 
slowly shuffling past him near the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. 
He was working the crowd as an elf for the Volunteers of America, 
taking instant pictures of passers-by posing with the more or less 
jolly old gent. ``Put your donation in the chimney, then you can take 
a picture with Santa. Santa needs your help.'' Santa _ Tony Serrano 
when he's not decked out in a white beard and red suit _ can usually 
take care of himself, as when a teen-ager wearing a jester hat sidled 
up. ``What do I want for Christmas?'' the jester teased. ``Where's 
the gift for me?'' While someone in the crowd muttered, ``You're gonna 
lose that hat,'' Serrano just fixed a silent stare on the smart aleck, 
who got the message and drifted away. Too bad Serrano did not have 
the same effect on his competition. On the blocks around the big tree, 
there were freelance Santas everywhere _ break dancing, drumming or 
just posing _ all cashing in on the holiday. This is not necessarily 
illegal, although two men were recently arrested on fraud charges 
for posing as Volunteers of America Sidewalk Santas. But the bell 
ringers who raise money for charity see no magic in the marketplace, 
since collections, and consequently their spirits, were down this 
year, they said. Near the end of his nine-hour shift on Sunday night, 
Lebron had collected $600, a disappointing drop from last year's usual 
daily take of $1,000. It bothers him, because the money he collects 
helps feed the needy. This is no small thing for him, since he was 
once homeless and hungry, so it angers him to see a crush of Kringle 
competitors looking out only for themselves. ``They got hip to our 
program and they feel it's easy money,'' Lebron said. ``They're out 
here to make a buck. If they were out to help different programs, 
that's cool. I wouldn't have a beef with that. But when you're selfish 
and doing it for yourself, I can't respect that.'' Respect is on Serrano's 
mind a lot when he's out on the street collecting money by his little 
red chimney, where a sign says ``Help Our Neediest Neighbors.'' Yet 
some people wearing fur coats and jewelry come up and try to snap 
his picture without making a small donation. Sometimes he stops jiggling, 
turns his back to them and points at the sign. When a dollar goes 
into the slot, he starts to dance and smile again. ``Can't they read?'' 
he said. ``The sign says `Help.' I represent the poor. They want to 
see me, they have to pay me. That's New York style. You have to get 
that straightened out when it comes to reality. I'm here to teach 
them respect.'' Serrano _ who calls himself Robot because he dances 
like one _ can charm crying toddlers into smiling and coax dollars 
from their parents. He can also size up wise guys who might try to 
swipe his beard or his floppy red cap. He has to be patient, yet firm. 
Jolly, but not a jerk. ``I keep my arms down so I can block them like 
with a style of karate,'' he said. ``It's not wise to let people get 
too close. You do have people with a bad attitude. They think it's 
funny whenever bad things happen to you.'' Mr. Serrano and Lebron 
know that misfortune is no joke. Both of them had had rocky times. 
They are now, with the help of the Volunteers of America, back on 
their feet, and they see their bell ringing as a way of helping others 
get a bit of the luck they've had. Maybe that personal understanding 
also helps explain why many of their donations come from people who 
don't have that much themselves. Lebron said working people who live 
from check to check usually give more often than others. They know 
their lives can slip into turmoil pretty easily, he said. One woman 
who lived in a shelter donated $10 a few weeks ago, but Lebron insisted 
she take back $5. Lebron has come pretty far this year. He moved into 
a new apartment in East Harlem, where he sometimes listens to tapes 
of some tunes he sang with different salsa bands and dreams of being 
discovered by a record producer. Should he wonder why he is spending 
more time on the sidewalk with Santa than he does in the studio with 
his music, a glance around his new neighborhood reminds him for whom 
the bell tolls. ``People see my face and hear my voice because I lived 
through it,'' he said. ``I like dealing with situations like this. 
Somebody's got to do it. Like Robot says, somebody's got to ring the 
bell. Somebody's got to be the voice of our community.''
