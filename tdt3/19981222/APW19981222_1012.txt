Jordan expressed the hope Tuesday that the recent political developments 
in Israel would not affect or hinder the Middle East peace process. 
``We hope that the early elections in Israel would not affect or delay 
the process of peace in the region,'' Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah 
Khatib told reporters after a Cabinet meeting. He said Jordan hopes 
that peace will not become hostage to political changes or developments 
in Israel. Israel's Parliament on Monday rejected Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu's peace policies and voted overwhelmingly for early elections.
