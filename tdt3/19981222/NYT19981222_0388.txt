There are those few who are actually on a first-name basis with the 
royalty of rock 'n' roll, who can talk truthfully about trips with 
Mick or Keith, dinners with Mariah or Shania and parties with Pete 
or John or Jewel. (Well, maybe Jewel is an exception, because everyone 
would by definition be on a first-name basis with a one-name celebrity.) 
For those who want to seem part of the rocknoscenti but have only 
been as close to a rock star as an orchestra seat in an amphitheater 
can get them, there is VH1, the music cable network. After years of 
struggling, VH1 has recently started to prosper by narrowing its focus 
to programs that offer viewers what are billed as intimate inside 
glimpses at the lives and careers of the most popular and successful 
singers and songwriters. Now VH1 is seeking to capitalize on recent 
gains in viewership and advertising revenue with a campaign that is 
intended to solidify an image as the best way to, as the ads put it, 
``go behind the music.'' In a series of commercials that are scheduled 
to begin appearing Saturday, Mick (Jagger) and Keith (Richards), Mariah 
(Carey) and Shania (Twain) and Pete (Townshend), John (Mellencamp) 
and Jewel (uh, Jewel), are presented in casual settings, chatting 
in a revelatory manner about their music. The spots, with a budget 
estimated at $15 million to $17 million, are the first work for VH1 
from Rubin Postaer &AMP; Associates in Santa Monica, Calif., which 
was selected in April after a review to create an image campaign for 
the network. ``We want to send a simple, clear message that backs 
up our strongest programming attribute, that we keep our viewers _ 
the young professionals in their 20s and 30s _ in touch with the bands, 
the music,'' said John Sykes, the New York-based president of VH1, 
part of the MTV Networks unit of Viacom Inc. ``You can make a lot 
of noise,'' he added, referring to extensive promotion campaigns, 
``but if the programming is not in place, the viewers will sample 
and then go away.'' Among the programs that have kept VH1 from falling 
into the more obscure corners of cable now dense with home-shopping 
and public-access channels are ``Behind the Music,'' ``Legends,'' 
``Storytellers'' and ``Pop-Up Video.'' And a concert in April, ``VH1 
Divas Live,'' featuring Ms. Carey, Ms. Twain and the sister sirens 
Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan and Carole King proved 
popular enough to spin off a compact disk that has shipped two million 
copies worldwide on the Epic Records label, according to Sykes. The 
commercials were created by Rubin Postaer and a director, Jon Kane, 
in a style meant to evoke the forthcoming, backstage tone and tenor 
of the VH1 programs. The singers, shot in black and white, speak in 
an off-the-cuff manner that is underlined by jump cuts punctuating 
their remarks. Each spot ends with the theme ``Go behind the music'' 
superimposed on screen along with the VH1 logo and the network's slogan, 
``Music first.'' Jagger, for instance, is seen standing in front of 
the windows of what seems to be a hotel room. ``I never intended to 
be a sex symbol,'' he declares. ``I thought of myself as a serious 
musician and I didn't want to be a stripper.'' ``But then in the end,'' 
he adds, ``I turned out to be just another girl out on the runway.'' 
The other commercials include Ms. Carey, in a swimming pool, discussing 
how her first album was written ``in the back of a wood shop''; Richards, 
on a jet, describing how he accidentally rediscovered the opening 
of ``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' on what was thought to be a blank 
tape, and Townshend, tracing the roots of his techniques of playing 
_ and smashing _ the guitar. ``We made a concerted effort not to craft 
the advertising,'' said Lance Bustrum, senior account planner at Rubin 
Postaer. ``We wanted the artists to talk in a way that personalizes 
them. It feels very real because the moments were real.'' ``It was 
interesting to see the reaction to the commercials we were getting 
in viewer research,'' he added. ``People who know the network said, 
`That's what I love about it,' and people who are not so familiar 
with VH1 said, `I've got to check this stuff out.''' Sykes said that 
one goal of the campaign was ``to get some of the `Nielsen occasionals' 
to watch us a little bit more,'' using TV-executive argot for infrequent 
viewers. The commercials will run through January on broadcast TV 
stations in 23 markets that account for 70 percent of the VH1 viewer 
base of 65 million cable households, during station breaks on series 
like ``Frasier'' and ``Friends.'' They will also appear on national 
cable networks like A&AMP;E; ESPN; Comedy Central, which Viacom owns 
with Time Warner Inc., and other cable networks owned by Viacom: MTV, 
Nick At Nite and TV Land. There will also be a poster campaign to 
supplement the commercials, Sykes said. The spots will, of course, 
also run on VH1. ``Viewers will be rewarded with a couple of extras 
they'll get to see'' only on that network, Bustrum said. And Sykes 
said that plans called for outtakes from the commercials ``to be posted 
on our Web site'' at www.vh1.com.
