1998 looks like a banner year for some of the nation's automakers. 
Daimler-Chrysler is on track to break its annual sales record led 
by a 13% surge in light truck sales. Ford is also likely to set a 
light truck sales record. General Motors has been hurt by the long 
strike by the auto workers but it is gearing up production of its 
hot-selling SUVs and pickup trucks for 1999.
