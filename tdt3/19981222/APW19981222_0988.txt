Palestinian journalists held a sit-in Tuesday to protest repression 
of the press, closely watched by security officials armed with video 
cameras. The Palestinian Authority last week briefly detained at least 
ten journalists and shut down several local TV and radio stations 
following coverage of pro-Iraqi demonstrations in Palestinian-held 
territories. About 100 journalists participated in the sit-in outside 
the Palestinian legislature. They bore a coffin draped in newspapers 
and magazines on their shoulders. ``Our place is not at the police 
anti-crime unit,'' one placard read. ``Yes to freedom of speech,'' 
said another. The journalists called on the Palestinian Authority 
to implement the legislature's Printing and Publishing Law, which 
includes guarantees of freedom of the press. That law ``should be 
the only judge of how to treat the Palestinian journalist,'' the deputy 
head of the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, Tawfik Abu Khoussa, 
told the protesters. Ten police belonging to the anti-crime unit filmed 
the proceedings on hand-held cameras, making sure to get each protester 
on film. The Palestinian Authority is anxious to sustain good relations 
with the United States, and had asked journalists to avoid filming 
anti-U.S. protests during last week's U.S.-British bombing of Iraq.
