The United States says it is willing to consider expansion of the 
U.N. Oil for Food Program in Iraq. However, Undersecretary of State, 
Thomas Pickering, says international sanctions can be lifted only 
if Iraq gets rid of its weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Pickering 
also said, Iraq must resume cooperation with UNSCOM, the U.N. weapons 
inspectors. It will either permit UNSCOM to come back or not permit 
UNSCOM to come back. If it doesn't permit UNSCOM to come back, then 
it has selected sanctions in perpetuity and that the United States 
will enforce its Red Line. No moves against the Kurds, no threats 
against its neighbors, no reconstitution of weapons of mass destruction, 
and we will rely on our intelligence to do that. Mr. Pickering said 
he -- spoke rather, as U.N. Security Council members were in further 
discussion on what to do concerning Iraq. Some council members have 
followed the U.S. and British air-strikes on Iraq with calls for an 
end to sanctions and changes in the U.N. weapons inspection system 
in Iraq.
