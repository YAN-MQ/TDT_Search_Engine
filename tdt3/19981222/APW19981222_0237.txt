China ordered a round-the-world balloon expedition to land Tuesday 
but organizers of the expedition said they didn't dare because of 
the rugged terrain. ``Impossible _ landing in that area is life-threatening,'' 
said project director Mike Kendrick in London, after the balloon team 
disclosed the Chinese decision. Earlier, the Chinese Foreign Ministry 
said it regretted that British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire 
Steve Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden did not abide by an earlier 
agreement to fly over southernmost China below 26 degrees north latitude.
