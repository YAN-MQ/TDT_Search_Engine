Iraq claims U.S. and British warplanes fired two stray missiles in 
the direction of the southern city of basra today. The Pentagon and 
the British defense ministry denied the report saying no missiles 
have been fired. Iraq's news agency didn't say if the missiles hit 
anything. The four days of air strikes against Iraq ended Saturday. 
The U.S. and Britain have characterized the operation a success and 
haven't ruled out future attacks.
