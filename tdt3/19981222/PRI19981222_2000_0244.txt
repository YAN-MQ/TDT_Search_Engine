Cambodia says it has started to remove 3,000 tons of toxic waste dumped 
near the southern coastal town of Sihanoukville. Thousands of people 
have fled the area after two people died. Their deaths are being blamed 
on waste imported from Taiwan and dumped outside the city. Henry Chen 
is a spokesman for the Taiwanese foreign ministry. It wants Cambodia 
to check out the case. First, we will act to to ask the Cambodian 
government to investigate where this waste came from. If this is -- 
really came from Taiwan, then we hope the government of Cambodia can 
negotiate this through the right channel to our government. Cambodian 
officials are appealing for calm. They're asking Sihanoukville residents 
not to flee.
