Iraq's deputy prime minister is calling the allied air strike a rambo-like 
manuever. Tariq Aziz says 62 members of the Iraqi military were killed 
and 180 wounded during the four-day action. He claims civilian casualties 
were much higher, but gives no details. Iraq wants the United Nations 
to hold Britain and the U.S. accountable. Aziz says the only diplomatic 
solution would be to condemn the aggressors and lift economic sanctions 
against Iraq. He suggests U.N. weapons inspectors will not be allowed 
to return to baghdad. The moment America and Britain launched missiles 
against Iraq, they killed unscom. UNSCOM is their own casualty, not 
ours.
