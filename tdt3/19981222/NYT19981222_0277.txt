In virtually every major poll taken in recent weeks, the people who 
believe that President Clinton should be removed from office are in 
the minority. But they are clearly resolute in their opinion, with 
most saying that the president lied both under oath and in his famous 
early pronouncement to the nation that he ``did not have sexual relations 
with that woman,'' and that such lies are automatic grounds for dismissal. 
And many of these people seem genuinely bewildered that more people 
do not see it their way. ``It's like I don't even understand what 
country I'm living in,'' said Jim Heller, a computer resource specialist 
in Sacramento, Calif. ``Are we saying you can have sex with a young 
intern in your office, and lie about it, under oath, and it's OK, 
your poll numbers are going to go to 70 percent? '' Others are angry 
as well. ``Of course he should be out of office,'' said Marilyn Velardi, 
a bookkeeper in Hendersonville, N.C. ``He's not only undermined our 
judicial system; he's belittled it.'' Said Gene Morin, a retired truck 
driver in Lakeland, Fla.: ``As far as someone lying, and expecting 
me to have their trust afterward, it doesn't work. When you take the 
oath of office, you swear to uphold the law.'' And still others, including 
some who support much of what the president has done in office, are 
distressed to conclude that he is morally unfit to serve. ``I voted 
for him twice and it grieves me to see his behavior,'' said Barbara, 
a research analyst and registered Democrat from central Kansas who 
declined to give her last name. ``I feel anguished about all of this. 
But he should not be in the Oval Office.'' With the prospect of an 
impeachment trial looming in the Senate, Clinton's Republican opponents 
strongly hope that more Americans will come to make the same bottom-line 
judgment. But for now, strong majorities say they disapprove of impeachment 
and want the president to finish out his term. Despite Clinton's having 
become on Saturday only the second president ever impeached, his job-approval 
ratings, as measured in a New York Times/CBS News poll this weekend, 
climbed 6 points from the week before, to 72 percent, among his highest 
ratings ever in office. Many of the people interviewed for this article, 
who were in the random group of Americans selected for that poll, 
concede that they have never liked Bill Clinton. ``From the get-go, 
I've thought he's a draft-dodger, leftist, liar, slick,'' said Gary 
Holzhauser, a 58-year-old computer programmer in Tebbetts, Mo. ``Just 
hearing him makes me mad.'' And the group of impeachment supporters 
is overwhelmingly white, slightly more male than female and heavy 
with people who describe themselves as Republicans and conservative. 
Moreover, many who disapprove of many aspects of the president's conduct 
in office say they are bothered that, in the end, the question of 
his fitness has been boiled down to the matter of his relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. ``Those contributions from the people in China, 
that bothers me more than the Monica stuff,'' said Tracy Hubbard, 
a 36-year-old homemaker in New York City. ``That should have been 
the issue, not Monica.'' (To be sure, at least one Clinton critic 
said he did not care ``how they get him,'' likening the president 
to Al Capone and other mobsters who were brought down on tax-evasion 
charges rather than the more-deadly crimes they were accused of.) 
But the group is also represented by people of all political persuasions 
who say they have struggled with what message the country would send 
to its children by allowing Clinton to remain in the top office in 
the nation. ``It's pretty hard to explain to young people why it's 
OK for the leader of your country to lie, but not for anyone else,'' 
said Raymond Bohn, a 34-year-old public school teacher from Brownsville, 
Texas, and a new father as of 10 days ago. ``What are the young people 
going to read in the history books?'' asked Karla O'Rourke, 60, a 
herbalist from Ramsey, N.J., and self-described political independent. 
``It's the man's integrity. He lied. If I cannot trust him to uphold 
the values that we instill in our youth, how can I trust him in any 
other issue? Sunny Pak, 42, a psychological counselor in San Diego, 
also said she thought Clinton had lost all moral authority to lead, 
and should be forced from office. ``He lied,'' she said. ``He pointed 
his finger and bit his lip and narrowed his eyes and said he didn't 
have a sexual relationship, and he's a bald-faced liar.'' ``Believe 
me, it was a very hard thing to do,'' said Paul. ``As a father trying 
to raise a son, it would be real easy for me to just pretend I didn't 
find out about that and let him go off and have a good time? But what 
kind of father would I be if I did that? ``Now, Clinton is the highest 
law-enforcement officer in the land,'' Paul continued. ``He took an 
oath. He swore to uphold and defend the Constitution.'' Like many 
others interviewed, Paul also felt that Clinton had never even repented 
for lying to the nation. ``I've listened to all his apologies, and 
they've turned me more against him,'' he said. ``The only thing he's 
apologizing for is, `Gee, I'm sorry I got caught,' and `Gee, I'm so 
sorry you have to see me this way.' I still haven't heard him say, 
`I lied.''' Many of those interviewed say they well understand the 
legal distinction between saying something under oath and saying it 
before television cameras while not under oath. But in general, they 
said they believed that Clinton deserves removal for lying in either 
instance, and said that they believed that such lies amounted to a 
``high crime,'' the standard set for impeachment under the Constitution. 
``I don't know the precise definition,'' said Dan Hinchen, 39, a civil 
engineer in Cherokee, Iowa (and, in fact, the Constitution doesn't 
offer one). ``But he let down the American people by lying to them. 
When he lies like that to the people, that's a high crime right there.'' 
Some seemed almost more offended by the one major public statement, 
unsworn, that the president made at the outset of the Lewinsky controversy. 
``When he stood there wagging his finger, it was like he was speaking 
right to all of us,'' said Ms. Hubbard, of New York. ``He was so sincere, 
and I find it a little frightening that he could just lie like that. 
We just can't have a president doing that.'' Asked whether other U.S. 
presidents had lied to the nation, many said yes. ``But I don't think 
ever quite as directly as this one does,'' said Marilyn Rinker, who 
helps to run a Christian summer camp in central Florida. ``Maybe lying 
has occurred when lives were in jeopardy, but not with something as 
blatant and as unnecessary as this whole thing was. Sheer arrogance.'' 
Teri McBrien, 38, an aerospace defense specialist in San Diego, said 
she also thought that Clinton's dalliance raised ``national- security 
kinds of problems as well, which haven't been brought out very well. 
I mean, he was having these conversations on the telephone with high 
officials, doing presidential business while Monica Lewinsky was, 
you know, with him.'' More than anything, though, those who want the 
president removed came back to the issue of what they describe as 
his dishonesty. Said Heller, in Sacramento: ``I have two children, 
a 14-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy, and I tell them, I only 
want two things from you, and I'll give you the world. Honesty and 
respect. President Clinton can't even give the country honesty and 
respect, and he should not be our leader.'' And, these people say, 
they genuinely do not understand why so many other Americans don't 
seem to see share their views. ``I've got a couple of guys I play 
golf with, and all of us feel exactly the same way,'' said Holzhauser, 
in Missouri. ``We just can't see where this 70, 75 percent approval 
thing comes from. We can't figure out why we're so far out of the 
mainstream on this.''
