Nick Price never paid attention to the Ryder Cup, and not just because 
the only golf he could watch as a teen-ager was grainy film that was 
shipped to Rhodesia and shown at the club on Friday nights. ``It meant 
nothing to me,'' Price said. ``I didn't grow up having a chance to 
play on the Ryder Cup team, so it was never a contest. I went fishing.'' 
Chances are, Price will never play in a Ryder Cup. But 10 years or 
so down the road, it's not hard to picture Price as captain of an 
International team that takes on Lee Westwood, Sergio Garcia and the 
rest of the Europeans at The Belfry. It's bound to happen sooner or 
later. ``I think there's room for it, and I don't think it would devalue 
the Ryder Cup,'' Westwood said shortly after the International team 
beat the Yanks. As Jack Nicklaus said in Australia during closing 
ceremonies of the Presidents Cup, fresh off the worst rout the United 
States has endured, ``We used to think golf was only played in the 
United States. We didn't even invent it. I'm not even sure how well 
we play it anymore.'' The comment was tongue-in-cheek, but the point 
was unmistakable. Golf is as global as it ever has been. And now that 
the five major tours worldwide have joined forces to promote the World 
Golf Championship series that starts in February and will travel to 
Spain, Asia and Australia the next three years, it will get even bigger. 
Big enough even for the Ryder Cup _ or the Presidents Cup _ to make 
room for someone else. ``I think ultimately what will happen is a 
tri-match,'' Nicklaus said. ``I think the reason that will happen 
is that right now, it's a great event every other year for Europe, 
and a great event other every year for the rest of the world. But 
it's harder every year to get our guys motivated to do that. ``Right 
now, it's pretty good the way it is,'' he said. ``Someday, probably 
sooner rather than later, that might happen.'' How to go about it 
is the sticking point. Asked what he meant by a tri-match, Nicklaus 
changed the subject because he wasn't quite sure. Neither was anyone 
else, for that matter. ``Certainly now, there may be a call for us 
to play against Europe, but when are we going to fit it in?'' Price 
said. ``A three-way round-robin thing would get kind of confusing 
to everyone.'' One suggestion is to have the winner of the Presidents 
Cup play the winner of the Ryder Cup. Of course, the way the Americans 
have played lately, they could find themselves taking off every other 
year. And who's to say the International team won't find it difficult 
to get motivated for the matches year in and year out? ``The hard 
thing for the Americans ... is they really don't have a break,'' Australia's 
Craig Parry said. ``We've got something to really go out and play 
for. The Presidents Cup means something to our team.'' And it meant 
something to the Americans, although clearly not as much as the Ryder 
Cup. It's not like they went down to Port Phillip Bay and cried their 
eyes out, which is what Mark Calcavecchia did after blowing his singles 
match in the 1991 Ryder Cup at Kiawah Island. ``Heck, it's almost 
Christmas time,'' Calcavecchia said. ``We'll get over it. And two 
years down the road, a lot of these guys will be on the team again, 
and we'll have some new guys, and we'll give it another shot.'' Any 
kind of merger would require the blessing of PGA Tour commissioner 
Tim Finchem, who created the Presidents Cup, and the PGA of America, 
which runs the profitable Ryder Cup. For now, Finchem would like to 
see both events keep their own identity. ``I would never say never 
to anything, but I do think that kind of structure would be a little 
bit unwieldy and might take a while to accommodate,'' Finchem said. 
``But that's something we may start talking about in a few years. 
We'll see what happens.'' Until then, there will continue to be two 
cups with two separate identities. And right now, neither one belongs 
to the United States.
