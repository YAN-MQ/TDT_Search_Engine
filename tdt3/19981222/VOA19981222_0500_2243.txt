President Clinton is ruling out any compromise on where the bombers 
who brought down Pan American Flight 103 should be imprisoned if they 
are convicted. The issue has become a stumbling block in efforts to 
try to Libyans for their alleged involvement in the attack over Lockerbee, 
Scotland one decade ago. VOA's Deborah Tate reports from the White 
House. It has been 10 years since a bomb blew up Pan Am flight 103 
killing 270 people. But the two Libyan suspects have yet to be brought 
to justice to the frustration of President Clinton and the anger of 
many of the victims' families. In an effort to end a prolonged standoff 
over the issue, Washington and London earlier this year dropped their 
insistence that the suspects be extradited to either of their countries. 
Instead, they've challenged Libya to make good on its offer to allow 
them to be tried in the Hague under Scottish law. Following a meeting 
with U.N. Secretary General Koffi Annan earlier this month in Tripoli, 
Libyan leader Mummar Kaddafi appeared to agree to release the suspects 
on those conditions. But a dispute over where they would serve their 
prison time if convicted remained a stumbling block. At a memorial 
service for the victims of the airliner bombing at Arlington National 
Cemetery outside Washington Monday, Mr. Clinton made clear there would 
be no compromise on the matter. The Libyan leader, Mr. Kaddafi, has 
given us mixed signals. We believe there is still some possibility 
he will accept our offer. That would be the best outcome, for it would 
mean that, finally, there would be a trial. But let me be absolutely 
clear to all of you: Our policy is not to trust Mr. Kaddafi's claims. 
It is to test them. This is a take it or leave it offer. We will not 
negotiate its terms. If the suspects are convicted, they will serve 
their time in Scotland. In a warning to Colonel Kaddafi, Mr. Clinton 
said that if the two suspects are not turned over for trial, he would 
work with the United Nations to seek stronger sanctions against Libya.
