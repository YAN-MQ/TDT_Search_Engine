Well, two of the National Football League's greatest passers, Miami 
Dolphin's Dan Morino, and Denver Bronco's John Elway, did battle on 
Monday. And, the incomparable Morino came away with a win. In their 
first field encounter in 13 years, Morino out-dueled Elway in a 31-21 
triumph that sends the Dolphins to the playoffs for a second consecutive 
year. Morino, the league's all-time leading passer had his record 
59th three hundred yard game and threw four touchdowns for a record 
21st time in his career. Morino flashed the brilliance that earned 
him nearly every quarterback record in completing 23 of 38 passes 
for 355 yards. But, he says winning the game was more important than 
out-gunning Elway. I think its more satisfying because the Dolphin's 
won and we're in the playoffs. And, if we win another game, you know, 
we'll have a good chance of getting a home playoff game. John is a 
special player, and you know. He's the best quarterback I've ever 
seen. Elway says suffering their second loss in a row was good medicine 
to keep the Broncos from becoming complacent. Sure, we're disappointed 
tonight. But, I think that if anything, this type game and what happened 
to us tonight, if anything, should light the fire a little bit brighter, 
which it were, needs to burn. So, no, we're going to be fine and we've 
just got to get it back on track, and we'll do that. League rushing 
leader, Terrell Davis was held to 29 yards on 16 carries -- by far 
his worst performance of the season. Elway, meanwhile, completed, 
on 13 of 36 passes, and was intercepted twice.
