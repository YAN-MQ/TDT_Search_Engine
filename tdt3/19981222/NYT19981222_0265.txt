Bangalore Venkata Raman, one of India's most respected astrologers, 
died on Sunday, suffering a heart attack as he edited The Astrological 
Magazine, the monthly publication he founded 62 years ago. He was 
86. In India, where a widespread belief in Vedic astrolology dictates 
the timing of both private and public occasions, from marriages to 
inaugurations, Raman was widely regarded as an honored scientist. 
He wrote about 200 books on the impact of celestial bodies on human 
destiny and world events and crusaded to gain international respect 
for traditional Indian beliefs and practices that Western encyclopedias 
discuss under the heading of occultism. In India he was addressed 
as ``Doctor,'' and at his death political leaders in his home state 
of Karnataka and in New Delhi offered public condolences. In its obituary, 
the national newspaper, The Hindu, noted without any qualification 
that Raman ``made several outstanding predictions relating to the 
Second World War, fates of Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito and others, 
Indian independence, the Chinese invasion of India, Nehru's death, 
Indo-Pakistan conflicts, the Vietnam War, the Declaration of Emergency 
in India, the assassination of Indira Gandhi and other events through 
his column in The Astrological Magazine.'' The obituary also cited 
Raman as a researcher in ``astro-psychology, weather and political 
forecasts and disease-diagnosis.'' From his home in Bangalore, a city 
that is one of the centers of Indian science and computer technology, 
Raman often challenged the Western scientific view of astrology as 
a pseudoscience whose methodology was distinctly opposed to its own 
findings and theories. In his book ``Astrology in Forecasting Weather 
and Earthquakes,'' he declared, ``There is a need on the part of the 
seismologists and meteorologists to shed their prejudices and embark 
on the investigation of the ingenious methods used for thousands of 
years with such success.'' Elsewhere he lashed out at those who paid 
no heed to Vedic astrology, which links astrological lore from Greek 
and Chaldean sources to the notions of karma and the aims of life 
described in ancient Hindu texts. ``The government's supine ignorance 
to the tremendous potential of astronomy is indigestible, especially 
so since those forewarnings can save lives and sufferings,'' he wrote, 
citing the 10 months' advance notice he gave in his column of the 
earthquake that struck Iran on Sept. 18, 1978. Raman traveled widely, 
addressing conferences and university meetings. In 1970 he lectured 
at the United Nations on the ``Relevance of astrology in modern times.'' 
In 1959 he came to New York to address a congress on astronomy, leading 
him to write ``A Hindu in America,'' in which he said he had no difficulty 
in surviving on a diet of vegetables, fruit, milk and cornflakes. 
In 1994 he delivered the keynote address at the first international 
symposium on Vedic astrology, in San Rafael, Calif., where he was 
given a lifetime achievement award. In his travels abroad he would 
often cite such Western scientists as Max Planck, George Wald and 
Bertrand Russell, and their reservations about the possibilities of 
science, as proof that Indian disciplines of thought and faith deserved 
respect alongside the dominant canons of science. He was was born 
in a village near Bangalore on Aug. 8, 1912. He studied in Bangalore, 
specializing in homeopathy. He started his magazine in 1936, building 
it into a publication read in India and 20 other countries. The magazine's 
Internet site declares that he received an honorary directorate from 
the Pythagorean University in 1947 and was elected a Fellow of the 
Royal Astronomical Society in London. It also says that while he did 
not draw up charts for money, he was regularly consulted by ``saints, 
scientists, political leaders and heads of governments.'' In his writings 
and publishing, Raman was helped by his wife, Rajeswari, who is the 
director of an institute of yoga for women. He is also survived by 
his daughter, Gayatri Devi Vasudev.
