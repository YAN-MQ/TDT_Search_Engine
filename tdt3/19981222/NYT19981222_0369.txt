Paul H. Smucker, the former chairman of the jelly company in Orrville, 
Ohio, that bears his family's name, died last Thursday at his home 
in Orrville. He was 81. Smucker is credited with helping transform 
the J.M. Smucker Co. from a small, regional jam and jelly manufacturer 
to a company with global operations and a product line that includes 
preserves, jams, jellies and other fruit-spread products; health and 
natural foods; beverages; ice cream toppings, and natural peanut butter. 
Smucker had worked for Smucker's, founded by his grandfather 101 years 
ago, since 1939, with a brief hiatus from the company when he served 
aboard a Navy destroyer in World War II. After serving in the war, 
Smucker became Smucker's general manager, a position he held until 
he became the company's president in 1961. In 1970, he assumed the 
additional titles of chairman and chief executive. Smucker turned 
over the company's presidency to his eldest son, Tim, in 1981. Tim 
Smucker succeeded his father as chairman in 1987, the same year Smucker's 
younger son, Richard, became the company's president. At that time, 
Smucker became chairman of Smucker's executive committee, a position 
he held until his death. Smucker graduated from Miami University in 
Oxford, Ohio, from which he also received an honorary Doctor of Laws 
degree. He was a former board member of the Kellogg Company and the 
First National Bank of Orrville and was a trustee of the W.K. Kellogg 
Foundation. Smucker is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former 
Lorraine Smith; a sister, Marcella Smucker Clark of Scottsdale, Ariz.; 
a daughter, Susan Smucker Wagstaff of Carmel, Calif.; his two sons, 
Tim, of Orrville, and Richard, of Medina, Ohio; eight grandchildren, 
and three great-grandchildren.
