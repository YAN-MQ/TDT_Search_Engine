Power to the people. If you don't like how a company's being run and 
you're a shareholder, stand up and be heard. That's what one outspoken 
woman says, anyway. Bill dorman reports. When most people pick up 
a new car, they don't get the keys from the company chairman. But 
Evelyn wye Davis is different. Evelyn has had a long tradition of 
receiving the keys from the CEOs of the various auto companies. That's 
because Evelyn has had a long tradition of showing up at shareholder 
meetings with pesky public questions and, sometimes, suggestions. 
If you look at the box, stop paying the lawyers, okay? Davis has been 
going to annual meetings for nearly 40 years, lobbying for corporate 
changes with mixed results. She now holds stock in more than 100 companies. 
GM's chairman is just glad to be on her good side. I'm sure she'll 
still have a few issues at the annual meeting. But we're happy to 
have her in a General Motors product. This is the first time she's 
bought from competitors before. So this is a first. We're happy about 
that. Like I say, these guys are very competitive, and they all love 
each other, so I learned how to play one against the other. Shall 
we say, manipulating the male ego? Well, you know, you grabbed that 
Mike pretty quick, too, so you're not bad at manipulating the media 
either. The season of annual corporate meetings doesn't begin until 
april, which gives Evelyn wye Davis some time to drive around and 
come up with some questions. Bill dorman, "CNN Financial News," Washington.
