The Italian telecommunications regulator said Tuesday that it will 
leave local telephone tariffs unchanged and reduce regional and long-distance 
rates in the first stage of repricing. As of Feb. 1, regional rates 
will drop by 7 percent and international rates will fall by 9.6 percent. 
The first phase of repricing will be followed by moves in March and 
July. In that second phase, the authority will switch many calls to 
local tariffs from regional tariffs. Measurement of phone calls in 
seconds instead of usage units will be phased in between April 1 and 
June 30. The regulator also aims to switch tariff setting for mobile 
phone calls to mobile operators from fixed-line operators. As part 
of a European Union agreement, Italy is to complete the necessary 
repricing of long distance and local phone tariffs by July.
