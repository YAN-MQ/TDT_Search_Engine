In an indication of improved ties between two Balkan neighbors, Greece's 
foreign minister met in Macedonia Tuesday with government officials. 
Theodoros Pangalos' one-day trip is the first official visit by a 
European Union minister since the new Macedonian government was sworn 
in after October's general elections. Pangalos and his counterpart, 
Aleksandar Dimitrov, said their talks concentrated on economic issues, 
including discussions on a possible oil pipeline connecting the northern 
Greek port of Salonica with Skopje, and new rail and road links. Both 
sides agreed a long-standing squabble over the former Yugoslav republic's 
name should not get in the way of economic cooperation. Greece claims 
the use of the name ``Macedonia'' masks expansionist aims by its neighbor, 
and insists the northern Greek province of Macedonia is the only region 
entitled to the name. Talks held under United Nations auspices in 
New York to resolve the dispute have made little headway, with 19 
rounds of negotiations already completed. The dispute led to a crippling 
embargo imposed by Greece on Macedonia in 1994. Although the embargo 
was lifted in 1995 following an interim agreement, relations remained 
frosty. Greece recognizes Macedonia as the ``Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia,'' and will deal with the country only when it uses that 
name, which is also the one officially used by the U.N. General Assembly. 
The Balkan neighbors are eager to concentrate on now burgeoning economic 
ties, but fear the name issue could interfere. The issue ``is a ... 
hurdle in our relations and is not in accordance with the mutual desire 
for cooperation,'' Dimitrov said. His Greek counterpart agreed. ``It 
needs courage ... to look forward and overcome the miseries of the 
past,'' Pangalos noted. Macedonia, which borders ethnically tense 
Kosovo province, is particularly interested in reducing friction with 
its neighbors. The new government's hopes to eventually join international 
organizations such as NATO and the European Union add impetus to the 
drive for improving relations with EU member Greece. One of the new 
government's first decisions was to allow the deployment on Macedonian 
soil of a 1,800-strong NATO rapid reaction force, designed to provide 
assistance to 2,000 international verifiers monitoring the situation 
in neighboring Kosovo. Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991 _ 
the only former Yugoslav republic to do so without bloodshed. It joined 
NATO's Partnership for Peace Program in 1995.
