Film director Woody Allen on Tuesday said that the scandal involving 
President Bill Clinton was silly and had made a ``laughingstock'' 
of the United States. ``We have a good president who is being persecuted 
by the extreme right for having an affair with a consenting adult. 
Which by the way, his wife seems to accept,'' Allen said. ``It's made 
the United States the laughingstock of the world and our political 
atmosphere entertaining, silly and sad,'' he added, red-eyed and sniffling 
with a cold during a news conference for the French release of his 
film ``Celebrity,'' a comedy about America's appetite for fame. Hugely 
popular in France, where each of his films is a box office hit, Allen 
has had his own share of sex scandals. Revelations about his relationship 
with Soon Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of his former companion 
Mia Farrow and conductor Andre Previn, whipped up a media frenzy. 
He married Previn in Paris a year ago. ``Celebrity'' is shot mainly 
in Manhattan and features British actor Kenneth Branagh as the typical 
Allen character: a frustrated but sympathetic hypochondriac who has 
split with his wife, played by Judy Davis, making her fourth appearance 
in an Allen film. The Brooklyn-born director describes this 27th film 
as being about ``overwhelming celebrity run amok.'' ``In the United 
States, everyone has their own television show: lawyers, doctors, 
plastic surgeons ... Soon there won't be any audience,'' he added. 
He chose not to play Branagh's character because ``I'm too old and 
I wouldn't have given it the same richness and complexity.'' ``I wanted 
someone who could capture the Manhattan nervous, anxious tension I 
usually write about,'' he said. Despite the thrashing he gives to 
America's insatiable craze for creating superstars, Allen acknowledged 
the perks of fame. ``There are problems, but they're minor. You have 
no private life, journalists write about you and it's not always true, 
you're followed around by paparazzi. But they're not life-threatening. 
``I won't lie to you ... Your salary is disproportionately high, you 
can always get restaurant reservations and theater tickets, doctors 
will come to your house on weekends and when a policeman stops you 
for speeding, he asks for your autograph,'' he explained. Allen's 
next film is about a jazz musician in the 1930s. Starring Sean Penn 
and Uma Thurman, it is based on a script he wrote some 20 years ago.
