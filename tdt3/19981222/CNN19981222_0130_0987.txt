The Lockerbie explosion and other disasters have prompted airlines 
to make changes in safety procedures. More on that from Stephanie 
Oswald. After Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, 
it took five hours for George Williams to find out his 24-year-old 
son, jordie, had been on board. He had missed the plane he was supposed 
to catch, so we didn't know the flight number. We had sent him tickets, 
and he caught the next flight out. Airlines were reactive in notifying 
families, in that they would have to have families call them first, 
and then they would check the passenger manifests, and then they would 
then call the families back. Ten years later, perhaps the greatest 
legacy from the ill-fated flight -- a system to gather detailed passenger 
information. I need a contact for you. a department of transportation 
rule went into effect in October requiring airlines flying to and 
from the United States to obtain full names from U.S. citizens and 
to ask for emergency contact information. In the decade since Pan 
Am 103, the federal aviation administration has examined and intensified 
airport security. The aviation security improvement act of 1990 called 
for major changes. Among them -- placement of security officers overseas. 
Improved training standards for security personnel at U.S. airports. 
Published guidelines for building security into new airports. And 
better communication between government agencies. George Williams 
served on the Gore commission. Involving families of crash victims 
in decisionmaking has been another milestone in aviation history since 
the downing of Pan Am 103. From the tragedy they lived through, they 
could bring a perspective that the government and the airlines didn't 
have. The government is counting on teamwork to prevent history from 
repeating itself. Have your bags been with you at all times? And that 
includes cooperation from the flying public. Stephanie Oswald, CNN.
