At least 11 states will miss next month's deadline to fix computers 
used to pay unemployment insurance, but the states are making stopgap 
arrangements to avoid any interruption of benefits, federal officials 
said Tuesday. The computer problems with unemployment insurance are 
similar to those that threaten many federal and state government programs 
and business activities of corporations in the next two years, but 
the effects could come sooner in offices that send checks to unemployed 
workers. A person filing a claim for jobless benefits typically has 
a year to draw all the checks to which he or she is entitled. The 
last day of this ``benefit year'' is recorded when an application 
is received. So computers must be able to handle dates with the year 
2000, starting next month. The deputy secretary of labor, Kathryn 
O. Higgins, said the states lagging behind schedule were Arizona, 
Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico and Vermont. In addition, she said, Connecticut 
and Louisiana are not yet ready, but have told federal officials that 
they will make the necessary changes in their computers within 10 
days. In the District of Columbia, problems are so severe that the 
Labor Department has assigned some of its employees to the city to 
make sure jobless benefits are paid next year. John A. Koskinen, a 
White House official who supervises preparations for the year 2000, 
said unemployment insurance was one of the first government programs 
that could be affected. Higgins said it was a test case, showing what 
would happen when ``the New Deal meets the new millennium.'' Many 
of the computer systems used to pay jobless benefits are more than 
30 years old. The year 2000 problem arises from early computer programmers 
often using a two-digit format to express the year. In such computer 
programs, 2000 is often indistinguishable from 1900. If the problem 
is not corrected, experts say, computers could produce inaccurate 
data or shut down. A recent survey of the states by the General Accounting 
Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that many were behind 
schedule in renovating their computers. Only one-third of the 421 
computer systems used for seven major health, welfare and nutrition 
programs were ready for the year 2000. Higgins said there would inevitably 
be ``glitches'' in the payment of jobless benefits next year. ``For 
the system to work perfectly, states would have to anticipate every 
chip, every piece of code that's in the system,'' she said. ``Everybody 
expects that there will be some states where they don't catch everything.'' 
But Koskinen, the chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 
2000 Conversion, an interagency group, said: ``There is no way to 
guarantee that your testing has been thorough and deep enough to catch 
all the problems. People ought to expect that there will be individualized 
small problems and errors.'' Some state contingency plans call for 
checks to be issued by hand. Under other plans, people would be certified 
as eligible for benefits through Dec. 31, 1999, even if they were 
actually eligible for a longer period running into the year 2000. 
Alternatively, a state having difficulties could seek help from other 
states with extra computer capacity. The unemployment insurance program, 
created by the Social Security Act of 1935, is administered mainly 
by the states, but the federal government provides most of the money 
for benefits.
