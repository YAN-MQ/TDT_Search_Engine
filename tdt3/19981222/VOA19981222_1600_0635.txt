The ruling party of the Central African Republic has won the most 
seats in the national Assembly, but suffered a blow by falling six 
seats short of an absolute majority. The constitutional court, today, 
released final results of the legislative elections held November 
22nd and December 13th. President Onsch Valez Matasaze's movement 
for liberation of the Central African people won 49 of the 109 seats. 
But, an opposition alliance won a total of 53. The remainder of the 
seats will be held by independents, who will play a key role in deciding 
whether the Ruben party or opposition alliance controls the legislative 
branch of government.
