Anglo American Corp., the South African mining and investment conglomerate, 
says it is still negotiating to take over Zambia copper mines despite 
a statement to the contrary by a Zambian official. Anglo American 
said Monday it is concerned about current low copper prices, and that 
it has not been able to attract partners, it said. The company said 
it has a memorandum of understanding with the Zambian government, 
but the memorandum hasn't yet been ratified by the government or the 
company. Zambian Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi said Saturday that 
Anglo American would take over Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines, the 
remaining major assets of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines. Anglo 
American said the memorandum of understanding - between the government 
and ZCI Ltd., the company through which Anglo American holds its interest 
in the mines - isn't legally binding. ``Negotiations on several important 
issues are continuing and it remains uncertain that agreement will 
be achieved on a basis acceptable to both sides,'' the company said. 
``A joint statement will be issued on the conclusion of the current 
negotiations.'' Nawakwi said the final touches of the deal would be 
completed by March 31. She said the agreement also had the government 
keeping a 20 percent stake.
