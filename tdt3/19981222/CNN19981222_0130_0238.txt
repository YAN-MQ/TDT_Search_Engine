The Pentagon says 85% of the 100 targets attacked in Iraq last week 
were hit, and 74% of those hits were "fully successful." The commander 
of U.S. forces in the Persian gulf released the numbers at a Briefing 
today. He said the United States had the most trouble hitting mobile 
missiles and parts of the Iraqi air defense. Of the 16 surface-to-air 
missiles targeted, nine were hit. Despite the end of hostilities, 
the 20,000 U.S. military personnel in the allied containment force 
are staying in the gulf while troop reinforcements are coming home.
