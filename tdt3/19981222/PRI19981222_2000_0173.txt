And, in Washington, President Clinton's approval rating is the highest 
it's ever been, and now some senators are considering a censure motion 
rather than a Senate trial for impeachment. THE WORLD's Owen Faye 
reports. Four Republicans who voted for impeachment now want the Senate 
to forego a trial and censure Bill Clinton instead. The White House 
has seized on the announcement, arguing the entire impeachment proceeding 
amounted to nothing more than an attempt by the president's enemies 
to destroy him. However, Democratic senators are urging the White 
House to stay silent, hinting censure remains a viable option but 
cautioning against pressure, insisting any decision on how to proceed 
will be decided by the Senate alone. If a censure motion is adopted, 
it would likely come after the preliminary stages of a trial, which 
could begin as early as January 6th. For THE WORLD, I'm Owen Faye 
in Washington.
