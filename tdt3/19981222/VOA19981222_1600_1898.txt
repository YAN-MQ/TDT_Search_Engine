At the State Department, Tuesday, U.S. Undersecretary of State, Thomas 
Pickering, talked about the situation in Iraq. He was asked if the 
United States would support the return of the U.N. inspectors to Iraq. 
If it is prepared to have UNSCOM come back, and if the Security Council 
wants to do that, the United States has said, very clearly, we will 
not stand in the way of that. If it is prepared to move to disarmament, 
in order to deal with the question of continued sanctions against 
it, we are prepared to go back to that formula, which was a formula 
that preexisted. But, that Iraq will have to demonstrate, very clearly, 
that not only is it in verbal terms, in oral terms, in linguistic 
terms, prepared to admit that come-back. But, we would like to see 
it make it very clear that in terms of action, it is prepared to work 
with UNSCOM to achieve those objectives. Thomas Pickering also said 
the United States is willing to consider expansion of the U.N. Oil 
for Food program in Iraq. However, he said international sanctions 
can be lifted only if Iraq gets rid of its weapons of mass destruction.
