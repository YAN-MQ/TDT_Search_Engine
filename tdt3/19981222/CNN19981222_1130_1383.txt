Okay, you probably think they look alike. But with gateway you get 
basic help over the phone for as long as you own it. After a month, 
you pay for it. Here, you get a color printer. Nope, not here. This 
one you can trade in toward the purchase of a new one after two years. 
Yours forever. Still think they look alike? We'll build you a PC like 
this one for $1,598 or $45 a month. Call 1-800-gateway
