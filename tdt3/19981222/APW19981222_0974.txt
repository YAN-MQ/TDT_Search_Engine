The chief of Iran's hard-line judiciary has ordered the formation 
of a committee to investigate a spate of recent mysterious deaths 
of dissidents, Tehran newspapers reported Tuesday. The official, Ayatollah 
Mohammad Yazdi, said the special committee was set up to improve coordination 
of information and evidence concerning the killing cases, the Farsi-language 
Iran and other newspapers reported. No other details were available. 
A similar special investigative committee has already been set up 
by moderate President Mohammad Khatami, and it was not immediately 
clear if the one ordered by Yazdi would work independently or support 
the other one. All the five dissidents who died during the last month 
were critical of the government's hard-line clergymen who are trying 
to stymie the social and political reforms of Khatami. Thousands of 
students and intellectuals demonstrated last week to protest the killings 
and called for the dismissal of Yazdi and other intelligence officials. 
There is, however, no evidence linking the hard-liners with the killings, 
and the conservative faction has suggested that unnamed foreign forces 
and even an opposition group in exile could be killing dissidents 
to discredit the government. It all began when the head of an Iranian 
opposition group, Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found 
stabbed to death in their home on Nov. 22. In the following weeks, 
writers Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and Mohammad Mokhtari, disappeared 
from their homes and their bodies were were found dumped on the outskirts 
of Tehran on different days. They were apparently strangled. Both 
had tried to establish a writers' association and had been summoned 
by a court two months earlier to answer questions about their activities. 
Another writer, Majid Sharif, was also found dead after disappearing 
from home. But his family said he may have died of a heart attack. 
Two more political activists remain missing.
