And when we come back, the White House view on all of this. We're 
going to be joined by lanny Davis. It was one of those moments in 
life you want to keep. My husband thought he was getting dinner. My 
daughter...A new friend. Time to cook the lobster! When the moment 
came, I didn't have to worry about the light being low hey! That's 
my lobster! Or them turning out blurry because they were moving. With 
Kodak Max, I knew I'd get my picture. Low light, sunlight, action 
or still Kodak Max is all you need to know about film.
