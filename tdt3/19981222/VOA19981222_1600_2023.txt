Angola's strategic center, town of Kweto, has come under heavy bombardment 
by UNITA rebels, causing some deaths and injuries to civilians. A 
secondary school was hit in the shelling. Artillery rounds also landed 
near the palace of a provincial governor, and near a building sheltering 
refugees. There are no reliable figures on the number of deaths, but 
Angolan radio stations say 24 people were injured.
