The Pentagon says it was "distressed" a U.S. serviceman scrawled a 
cynical ramadan greeting on a missile before it was fired at Iraq 
last week. It calls the incident inappropriate, saying such comments 
don't reflect american policy or values. But Pentagon spokesman Ken 
bacon did not say there would be an investigation. The incident came 
to light after a wire service photographer took a picture of the missile.
