Pentagon officials, meanwhile, are strongly denying Iraqi news reports 
that U.S. aircraft fired missiles over southern Iraq. VOA's Jim Randall 
has the report from the Pentagon. A Baghdad television report says 
that aircraft pounces by what they call "criminal aggressors," fired 
two missiles at random near Basra before fleeing. The broadcast reports 
that the incident occurred early Tuesday afternoon. A U.S. Air Force 
spokesman called the report "bogus." Lieutenant Colonel J. DeFrank 
says U.S. and British warplanes routinely patrol the skies over Southern 
and Northern Iraq, enforcing a "no-fly" zone, imposed after the Gulf 
War. He says if Iraqi forces threaten allied planes by pointing air 
defense radars at them, pilots are allowed to defend themselves by 
firing missiles. But, Colonel DeFrank and other Pentagon officials 
say, "Nothing of that sort happened, this time." Jim Randall, VOA 
news at the Pentagon.
