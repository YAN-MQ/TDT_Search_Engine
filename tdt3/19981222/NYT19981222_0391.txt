Stacy Williams stood on his soapbox in Times Square on Monday evening 
and let the world know he was back. ``You white people are the nastiest, 
lowdown, wicked creatures ever to walk the earth,'' he bellowed, his 
arms thrashing the air. His roar cut through police sirens, car horns 
and even the thick shell of cynicism coating the few New Yorkers in 
the throng. If there was a little extra fire in Williams' belly, it 
was because his religious group, the Black Israelites, had reached 
an interim settlement with the city last week that allowed them to 
remain at their high-profile perch, where they have been loudly prophesying 
a divine war of the races for years. The lawsuit, filed with the help 
of the New York Civil Liberties Union, contends that the administration 
of Mayor Rudoplh Giuliani has been trying to stifle the Israelites 
by confiscating their literature, revoking their amplified-sound permit 
and randomly arresting its members on trumped-up charges. For Williams, 
the lead negotiator with the city and a Black Israelite priest, the 
crackdown only reaffirmed his belief that his brethren are persecuted 
apostles. ``We're being treated no differently than the early Christians, 
except we're not being killed,'' said Williams, whose 25-year-old 
congregation, based in Harlem, believes that whites are devils and 
blacks are the true descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. His 
sidewalk preaching over for the evening, Williams was hungry. He chose 
the Blue Water Grill, a trendy seafood place on Union Square where 
the only nonwhites were busing tables or playing the jazz that filled 
the dining room. As he waded through the crowd, he was greeted warmly 
by the captain and the hostess, both of whom he knew from previous 
visits. ``Most people have no idea what I do,'' said Williams, 39, 
whose formidable girth seems better suited for football than for preaching. 
In contrast to his angry Times Square persona, he was jovial and open 
to skeptical prodding. ``I'm not militant,'' he said. ``I just look 
that way.'' He ordered a plate of sushi, a bottle of white Zinfandel 
and talked about what he said was an uneventful childhood in upstate 
New York. He was born in the Bronx but his mother, felled by a nervous 
breakdown, sent him and his brother to a group home in Millbrook. 
Williams says he came to appreciate the country air, solid schools 
and racially mixed populace. ``I became a master chess player at 7,'' 
he said. Many of his friends, he points out, were white. But the city 
drew him back at 16, which was when Williams' formal education came 
to an end. He worked as a contractor, a stand-up comedian and a bouncer 
at Studio 54. He joined an interracial church and explored the Nation 
of Islam. ``My spirit was wandering,'' he said. It was the 1991 riots 
in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where Williams lived at the time, that 
helped deliver his spirit to the Black Israelites. Williams says the 
death of 7-year-old Gavin Cato, crushed by a car carrying the Lubavitch 
Grand Rabbi, convinced him that racial injustice in America reflected 
an evil of, quite literally, biblical proportions. ``When nobody was 
punished for this crime, it all came together for me,'' he said. Walking 
through Times Square that summer, Williams stopped to listen as the 
robed and turban-wearing Israelites talked about judgment day, when 
blacks would rule the world. ``What they said landed in the middle 
of my lap, my soul, my consciousness,'' he said. When he isn't preaching 
or spending time with his 2-year-old daughter, Williams, who lives 
in Harlem, works as a bodyguard and chauffeur for brand-name athletes 
and Hollywood celebrities. But since his name began appearing in newspapers, 
he said, business has dried up. ``It doesn't matter,'' he said, ``because 
God comes first.'' The Israelites keep kosher, study ancient Hebrew 
and avoid modern forms of entertainment. (As a group, they did see 
``Independence Day'' because of what Williams said were the film's 
``biblical implications.'') Israelite children attend the group's 
yeshiva, and women are not allowed to preach or teach. Williams disagrees 
with the widespread view that the Israelites are hate-mongering racists, 
and compares their invective to that of a prosecutor presenting evidence 
against an accused rapist. ``It's not like we're making this stuff 
up,'' he said, reeling off biblical passages to back up his belief 
that whites have done nothing but oppress, enslave and kill minorities. 
``We are the prosecutors of white America.'' Norman Siegel, who is 
representing the group in federal court, says he does not agree with 
the Israelites' message, but that that is beside the point. ``This 
is exactly the kind of speech the First Amendment was designed to 
protect,'' he said. Williams, noting that no black lawyers would touch 
the case, said he appreciated the help. Does that mean not all white 
people are devils? ``Some whites can be nice,'' he said, ``but if 
you spend enough time with them, they'll stab you in the back.'' Either 
way, he said, even well-intentioned whites will become slaves after 
Armageddon, which the Israelites expect with the millennium. As dessert 
and coffee were served, Williams' dinner companion protested that 
his relatives were recent immigrants, not slaveholders. ``Sorry about 
that,'' he said, smiling weakly. ``But your forefathers screwed it 
up for you.''
