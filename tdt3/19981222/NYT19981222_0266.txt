Matthias Hoffmann, the German promoter who turned the Three Tenors 
concerts into a worldwide extravaganza, was sentenced Tuesday to five 
years and eight months in prison for tax evasion. A court in Mannheim, 
Germany, found Hoffmann guilty of evading close to $10 million in 
taxes and said it was pursuing investigations against the tenors _ 
Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo _ for possible 
complicity in tax fraud. Pavarotti recently canceled two Berlin concerts, 
one with the Berlin Philharmonic on New Year's Eve and another with 
Deutsche Oper on Jan. 25, after lawyers advised him that it was unwise 
to come to Germany while the investigation continued. When they informed 
German organizers of the cancellations earlier this month, lawyers 
for Pavarotti said he would make up for his absence as soon as the 
case was resolved. Carreras and Domingo could not be reached Tuesday 
for comment. In New York, Pavarotti's manager, Herbert Breslin, said 
neither he nor his client had any comment. ``I'm not privy to the 
problems Hoffman has with the German tax authorities,'' Breslin said. 
Hoffmann, who organized the tenors' world tour in 1996, which included 
stops in the United States, Europe and Asia, was arrested in Germany 
in July 1997 and has since been held in prison. The court said Tuesday 
that the 17 months he had already served would be deducted from his 
sentence. Hoffman, 47, dropped out of Mannheim University in 1970 
to present a rock festival that became known as the German Woodstock. 
He set up his first concert agency in 1971, and initially focused 
on rock music, including concerts by the Rolling Stones and Queen. 
By the 1980s, he was also working with Carreras and Domingo, enjoying 
what he later described as ``incredible international success.'' In 
the mid-1990s he linked up with the Three Tenors, who had enjoyed 
a stunning success with their 1994 sellout concert at Dodger Stadium 
in Los Angeles. A dozen more concerts were organized and beamed to 
television audiences of hundreds of millions. Audio and video recordings 
of the concerts became the best-selling classical recordings ever. 
Hoffmann paid the tenors well: Each received $1.5 million a concert, 
German prosecutors said. In 1996 Pavarotti commented: ``Good money, 
eh? By God, it's good money.'' Prosecutors contended at the trial 
that Hoffmann avoided paying taxes by illegally splitting the payment 
for each concert into $500,000 in salary and $1,000,000 in licensing 
income, and paying the latter sum into a front company based in Ireland 
that prosecutors believe was controlled by the three tenors. Under 
German law, Hoffman should have deducted German taxes from the salary 
portion _ something he failed to do _ and should have explained to 
the tax authorities why such a large portion of the overall fee to 
the artists came in the form of licensing income. He was also accused 
of avoiding taxes on a number of other concerts and events with no 
link to the tenors. The case against Hoffmann grew out of the imprisonment 
of a Munich concert promoter, Marcel Avram, who was also accused of 
tax fraud. Lawyers for Hoffmann, who once described his partnership 
with the tenors as ``a winning team,'' had pleaded for a sentence 
of less than five years, while choosing not to contest several of 
the charges.
