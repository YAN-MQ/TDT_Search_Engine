British defense secretary, George Robertson, says four nights of air-raids 
caused heavy damage to Iraq's military capabilities. Mr. Robertson 
told reporters in London, Tuesday; evidence would be presented in 
the next few days to support his battle damage assessments. He also 
said the appearance of normal life and the apparent lack of damage 
to Iraqi's cities are an indication of how successful the bombing 
raids were at avoiding civilian casualties.
