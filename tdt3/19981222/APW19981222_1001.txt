Mohamed Al Fayed _ owner of London's famed Harrods department store 
and father of the late Princess Diana's beau, Dodi _ will be one of 
the judges at the 1999 Miss Universe Pageant. Prime Minister Basdeo 
Panday said he also hoped American television celebrity Oprah Winfrey 
would join Al Fayed on the judge's dais for the beauty contest here 
on May 26. Panday made the announcement Tuesday at a ``sod-turning'' 
ceremony to launch the renovation of a 55,000-square-foot (5,000-square-meter) 
former U.S. Navy hangar into a Hollywood-style stage for the event. 
The pageant will be broadcast live to about 2.5 billion people from 
the hangar, near Chaguaramas Bay on the lush northwestern peninsula 
of the Caribbean island. ``This marks the start of one of the largest 
promotional projects ever embarked on by this country,'' Panday said. 
``We seek to brand Trinidad and Tobago as a destination with a favorable 
climate for major investment, tourism and export of goods and services.'' 
His government is pushing to promote tourism and and help shift the 
economy from its almost total dependency on petroleum, natural gas 
and manufacturing. Dodi Fayed died along with the princess in a Paris 
car crash last year.
