New research may end concerns over epidurals, which are a type of 
anesthesia administered to women during childbirth. Some have maintained 
receiving an epidural makes a woman more likely to require a caesarean 
section. But a new study of over 2,000 women claim epidurals are not 
the cause of c-sections. It says childbirths that require epidurals 
are complicated and painful deliveries that likely would result in 
C-sections anyway. The study appears in the "journal of the American 
medical Association."
