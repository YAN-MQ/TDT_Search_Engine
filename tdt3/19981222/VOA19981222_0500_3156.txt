Toshiba Corporation, Japan's largest maker of notebook computers, 
has had its long-term credit rating cut by Standard & Poor's, which 
expressed concern over Toshiba's poor earnings. Meanwhile, the U.S. 
ratings agency, Mood's Investor Service, is also warning it may cut 
its ratings for Mazda Motors Corporation because of weakening car 
market and banking systems in Japan.
