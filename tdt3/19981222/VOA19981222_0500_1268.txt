Austrian skiers made history before the home fans in Insbrook Monday. 
Led by double-Olympic gold medalist Herman Meyer, they swept the top 
nine places in a men's World Cup super giant slalom race. That had 
never happened before in the men's or women's World Cup circuit. The 
previous best team showing was when France had the top six women in 
the down hill race in Italy in 1968 30 years ago. Finishing second 
to Meyer on Monday was Christian Meyer. He's no relation. Fritz Stroble 
was third. Norway's Lasa Polson was the first of the non-Austrian 
finishers in tenth place. He was one full second behind the winning 
time. Skiers in the second through sixth places were separated by 
a mere five-one-hundredths of a second. Meyer, known as the herminator, 
is now the overall World Cup leader. And postponed a women's World 
Cup super giant slalom ski race in France. After delaying the start 
by nearly three hours, the weather never improved. So race officials 
let the women leave early for their Christmas break. That's a look 
at sports. I'm Jim Stevenson.
