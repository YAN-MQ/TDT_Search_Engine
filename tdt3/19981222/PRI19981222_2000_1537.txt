In January, 11 European nations will begin using the euro for certain 
financial transactions. As Liz George reports from our business desk 
in New York, Wall Street is awaiting the change with some trepidation. 
To the average consumer, the change is mostly behind the scenes. At 
this point, it's businesses and money markets that will be affected. 
Kevin Mellon is vice president of Mercer Management Consulting. Obviously, 
Europe's always been an important market just because of the demographics, 
and the -- there are more people there than there are in the United 
States in these 11 countries. So -- there -- these are high-income 
people. It's obviously attractive. The barriers to entry -- and many 
will still remain, I mean, with no common commercial code and like 
cultural and legal differences, but the -- the barriers to entry have 
been tremendous in the sense that you've had this fragmentation into 
small currency markets. You've had to worry about the value of those 
currencies, hedging those currencies. So, in a sense, what it does 
is it -- it sort of makes the entire pie so big that it's worth more 
people's trouble to breach those barriers to entry. And it's that 
which will impact upon countries around the world, like the United 
States. Businesses doing trade with European Union countries will 
have to convert their billing systems into euros, and rather than 
dealing with 11 different exchange rates, there'll be just one. And 
with the introduction of the euro, which is likely to become a strong 
force within the world's currency market, could the dollar lose out? 
Kevin Mellon again. It's natural for there to be multiple re -- currencies 
in the world. The notion that one currency is competing geopolitically 
against another currency -- that might have been in the back of the 
minds of some of the original continental sponsors of the euro a long 
time ago. In the long run, I don't think that -- that that's much 
of an issue. Although businesses, money markets, and central banks 
will have to start dealing with euros from the beginning of the new 
year, individuals won't be carrying euro coins and notes until 2002. 
For THE WORLD, I'm Liz George in New York.
