The United States has moved closer to trade sanctions in a dispute 
with the European Union over banana imports. On Monday, Washington 
issued a list of EU products to be hit with punitive duties. The sanctions 
could take effect as early as February 2nd. The U.S. is exasperated 
over what it views as EU discrimination against Latin American bananas 
produced by U.S. multinationals. The EU is appealing for more time 
for negotiation. The World Trade Organization last year found EU banana 
import policies in violation of international trade rules.
