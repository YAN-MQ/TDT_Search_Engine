Iraq is accusing allied forces of renewed aggression. The Iraqi news 
agency reports two missiles were fired against southern Iraq today. 
U.S. and British military officials deny the report. Meanwhile, Iraqi 
deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz says last week's air strikes killed 
any chance Iraq would allow U.N. arms inspections to continue. But 
U.S. undersecretary of state Thomas Pickering insists Iraq has to 
cooperate with inspector before the U.N. can consider lifting sanctions. 
If, on the one hand, Iraq chooses to end its cooperation with UNSCOM, 
then it has literally chosen for sanctions in perpetuity, because 
it is only through disarmament, the common objective of the United 
Nations security council and UNSCOM's verification of disarmament 
that one can achieve the possibility of dealing with the issue of 
sanctions.
