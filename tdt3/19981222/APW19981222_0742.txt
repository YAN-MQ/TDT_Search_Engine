An Iranian court has rejected an appeal by the former mayor of Tehran 
who was sentenced to five years in jail for corruption. Gholamhossein 
Karbaschi's appeal was reviewed by three judges, and the ``charges 
and the cases of conviction remain the same,'' Iran's official news 
agency reported Tuesday. It quoted judiciary spokesman Fotovat Nasiri-Savadkouhi. 
The Islamic Republic News Agency did not say when the ruling was made. 
Karbaschi was sentenced in July and had been allowed to remain free 
on bail pending appeal. IRNA did not say if he had now been jailed, 
and judiciary officials could not be reached for comment. Karbaschi, 
an ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was a target of hard-line 
political rivals, and many Iranians saw the trial as a political settling 
of scores. He was found guilty of embezzlement during his eight years 
as Tehran's mayor. He was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement 
and two years for misappropriation of government money. He was also 
ordered to pay dlrs 500,000 in fines and compensation to the city 
and banned from holding any government job for 20 years. During his 
trial, Karbaschi admitted to making mistakes, but denied stealing 
public money. As mayor, Karbaschi built parks and social centers and 
reduced pollution and traffic congestion. But he also made enemies 
among the merchant class, which resented his taxes and his support 
for Khatami.
