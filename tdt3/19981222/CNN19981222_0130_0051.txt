From Atlanta, good evening. Lynne Russell, "CNN Headline News." President 
Clinton appears to be starting the holiday week focusing on anything 
but impeachment. While his legal aides spent today sharpening strategies 
for a Senate trial, the president and first lady Lent a hand at a 
food kitchen in Washington. They helped prepare lasagna meals for 
homeless people in emergency shelters. Afterwards, Mr. Clinton shared 
a holiday wish with the volunteers. I hope that everyone who sees 
the report on the news of all of our being here today will be inspired 
to follow suit at this Christmas season. The most important gifts 
we give are those that we give to those who need it the most who may 
never know our names or remember our faces, but who receive the gifts 
in the genuine spirit of the season.
