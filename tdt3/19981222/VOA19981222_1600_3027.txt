The International Monetary Fund says the impact of Asia's financial 
crisis is greater than anticipated. So, it's scaling back it's growth 
forecasts for the world economy the fourth downward revision in 12 
months. And, correspondent, Barry Wood, reports that the world economy 
is projected to grow only 2.2 percent, this year and next. The good 
news is that the IMF believes the worst of the Asian crisis is now 
over, and there will be no global recession. But, 2.2 percent world 
growth is modest, only half of what was achieved prior to the Asian 
devaluations of last year. In its December update to its world economic 
outlook, IMF forecasters say Japan's economy will shrink a further, 
one-and-a-half percent in 1999. That follows a revised 2.8 percent 
decline in 1998. The U.S. economy is projected to slow to 1.8 percent 
growth, about the same as the 15 European union nations, and a considerable 
reduction form the 3.6 percent growth of 1998. Because of its devaluation 
and retreat from market-based reform, the decade-long recession in 
Russia is expected to deepen in 1999, with the economy shrinking by 
another eight percent. The other post-Communist economies of eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union, are expected to decline by nearly 
two percent in 1999. That's a deeper slide than this year. The bright 
spots in Eastern Europe are the three Baltic states, which have all 
grown by five percent this year. Poland's steady five and a half percent 
growth is projected to slow, considerably, to about two percent in 
1999. In Asia, China continues to stand out. It has achieved seven 
percent growth, this year. And is projected at 6.6 percent in 1999. 
Indonesia has experienced a 15 percent decline this year, and growth 
is projected to fall another three percent next year. South Korea 
is down seven percent. In Latin America, overall growth is projected 
at 1.5 percent in 1999, down from 2.5 percent this year. Brazil is 
seen slipping into recession, with a one percent decline next year. 
The IMF commends the United States and West European central banks 
for cutting interest rates to boost economic activity. But, the IMF 
says the U.S. Federal Reserve should pause before taking further action 
to reduce rates. Barry Wood, VOA News, Washington.
