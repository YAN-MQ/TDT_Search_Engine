Roger Clemens withdrew his trade demand on Tuesday, saying he was 
prepared to report to spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays in 
February. Clemens, the only five-time Cy Young Award winner, had told 
the Blue Jays on Dec. 2 to trade him to a team closer to home or to 
a contender, citing an agreement he made with then-team president 
Paul Beeston in December 1996. Houston, Texas and the New York Yankees 
were the chief contenders, but Toronto couldn't find a deal to his 
liking and teams were scared off by Clemens' contract demands. During 
a news conference at his agents' offices, Clemens said that while 
he was withdrawing his demand, he would accept a trade if Toronto 
still wanted to make one and would not set a condition of renegotiating 
his dlrs 31.1 million, four-year contract, which has two years remaining. 
After he asked Houston to extend his contract for one year through 
2001 at dlrs 27.4 million _ which would essentially have given him 
a dlrs 43.5 million, three-year contract for the next three seasons 
_ Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker angrily pulled out of talks 
Dec. 13. Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks, said however that Houston 
owner Drayton McLane called to apologize for Hunsicker's behavior 
and that the Astros still were in negotiations with the Blue Jays. 
Toronto wanted three or four quality players or top prospects for 
Clemens, who won consecutive Cy Youngs in his first two seasons with 
the Blue Jays and went 41-13. He is owed dlrs 16.1 million in the 
final two seasons of his Blue Jays contract. When Clemens signed with 
Toronto, Beeston agreed that team would trade him if the pitcher became 
convinced the Blue Jays wouldn't contend. Clemens became disenchanted 
after Interbrew SA, the team's Belgian owner, said a budget with a 
payroll of about dlrs 40 million, and Toronto made little effort to 
re-sign Jose Canseco, who went to Tampa Bay.
