Now for the rest of the day's sports, here's VOA's Jim Stevenson. 
National Football League quarterback Jake Plummer has reaped the benefits 
of playing well for the Arizona Cardinals by receiving the largest 
signing bonus in league history. Plummer signed a four-year contract 
extension Monday worth nearly $30 million. That includes a huge $15-million 
bonus. Known as "Jake the Snake" because of his elusiveness, Plummer 
has led the Cardinals within sight of the team's first playoff appearance 
since 1982. Plummer says the big contract is a sign to the rest of 
the team that management is serious about building a winning franchise 
in Phoenix. It's a great sign to these guys that we're focusing on 
winning. And what we want to do is win ball games. And whatever it 
takes. And, you know, I'm just excited. I really feel lucky to be 
here in this opportunity and at this moment, because we're going in 
the right direction and that's up. Previously, the largest signing 
bonus had been a $13-million payment to Deion Sanders of the Dallas 
Cowboys. The first year of Plummer's $30-million extension overrides 
the final year of his three-year $1.6-million rookie contract.
