Ukraine's government will print money next year to cover its mounting 
wage arrears, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Tuesday. Pustovoitenko 
said the Cabinet plans a monetary emission of 1 billion hryvna (dlrs 
292 million), all of which would be used to pay off overdue wages 
and pensions, the Interfax news agency reported. Printing money generally 
stokes inflation. Pustovoitenko did not say how he expected next year's 
money emissions to affect the 1999 inflation rate, which was earlier 
forecast at 19 percent. Ukraine's government owes more than 2 billion 
hryvna (dlrs 584 million) to pensioners and about 1 billion hryvna 
(dlrs 292 million) in unpaid wages to state employees. The debt has 
been rising for years as the government, chronically short of revenues, 
kept delaying social security payments to pay off its other debts, 
including those to foreign creditors. Ukraine has to pay off about 
dlrs 2 billion on its foreign debt obligations next year, while its 
reserves amount to only half that amount. The cash shortage has forced 
government officials to propose printing money. The Cabinet also has 
said recently that it would use proceeds from upcoming privatization 
of the former Soviet republic's telecommunications monopoly to pay 
off wage and pension debts.
