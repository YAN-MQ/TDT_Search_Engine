Fire broke out in a Swedish department store crowded with Christmas 
shoppers Tuesday after a man poured a flammable liquid on the floor, 
police said. At least two people were injured. The afternoon fire 
started on the ground floor of the six-story PUB store, one of Stockholm's 
largest. The blaze set off an explosion that blew out a display window, 
injuring a female passerby. Christian Dalsgaard, the police official 
supervising the inquiry, said the fire was quickly extinguished by 
the store's sprinkler system, but the situation could have been ``very 
dangerous.'' ``It's terrible that something like this can happen in 
a big department store in the middle of the Christmas rush,'' he said. 
The center of the store is an open, atrium-like space extending from 
the top floor to one floor below street level, and the building quickly 
filled with smoke, police said. A man who was seen pouring liquid 
on the floor was grabbed by security guards and turned over to police. 
The suspect was drunk and could not be interrogated until he sobered 
up, the Swedish news agency TT quoted police spokesman Mats Nylen 
as saying. The fire started in an aisle next to a cosmetics boutique. 
Officials speculated the explosion may have been caused by burning 
aerosol cans. One of those injured was treated for smoke inhalation. 
The condition of the woman cut by the flying glass was not immediately 
known. Police allowed journalists into the store briefly. There was 
little fire damage but substantial water damage.
