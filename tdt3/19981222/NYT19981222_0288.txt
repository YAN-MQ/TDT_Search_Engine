A son-in-law of former President Suharto has been given honorary citizenship 
in Jordan, the official Antara press agency reported here Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, 11 Indonesian soldiers once commanded by the son-in-law, 
Prabowo Subianto, are to go on trial on charges of abducting and torturing 
political dissidents. Prabowo, a former lieutenant general and commander 
of the Kopassus commando force, was honorably discharged on Dec. 10, 
after having accepted responsibility for the kidnapping and torture 
of Suharto's political opponents. He has been living in Amman, Jordan, 
for four months, said his brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo, who added 
that Prabowo had several ailments, including malaria and liver and 
kidney disease. The trial of the commandos, in connection with the 
abduction and torture of 24 people this year, will be in a military 
court. One victim was found dead and 13 are missing. Prabowo and two 
other senior officers may face a court-martial if evidence is shown 
to link them to human rights abuses, the military says. Prabowo has 
said he is willing to return here to testify if required, his brother 
said. On Monday, State Secretary Akbar Tangjung said the government 
was about to wrap up its investigation. ``The process will be aimed 
at ascertaining the extent of retired Lt. Gen. Prabowo's involvement 
in the case,'' Tangjung said at a news conference. Justice Minister 
Muladi _ who like many Indonesians uses only one name _ warned Prabowo 
Tuesday not to accept Jordanian citizenship. ``We do not recognize 
dual citizenship,'' Muladi said. ``Once someone accepts another citizenship 
he loses Indonesian citizenship.'' On Monday, President B.J. Habibie 
pledged that the government would continue to investigate the role 
of the military in the rioting, arson and looting in May that left 
1,200 people dead and ended the 32-year autocratic reign of Suharto. 
Tangjung also said the government would ``soon finalize the judicial 
process'' in the case of a fatal shooting by the military of six Trisakti 
University students in the days before the riots. Also on Monday, 
in the face of widespread opposition, the government decided to postpone 
the creation of a 40,000-member civilian militia. The idea for the 
militia was put forward by the armed forces chief, General Wiranto, 
as a way to increase law and order, especially before elections scheduled 
for June 7.
