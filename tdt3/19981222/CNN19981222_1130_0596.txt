At this hospital in Houston, Texas, doctors say one of the first known 
living octuplets is breathing on her own. Her siblings are all on 
ventilators. All eight are in critical but stable condition. The 27-year-old 
mother gave birth to the first baby nearly two weeks ago and doctors 
delayed delivery of the other seven until Sunday. Still, they were 
born nearly three months premature.
