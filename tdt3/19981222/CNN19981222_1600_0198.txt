The Pentagon says it was "distressed" a U.S. serviceman scrawled the 
words "Happy Ramadan" on a missile before it was fired at Iraq last 
week. Officials call the incident inappropriate saying it doesn't 
reflect american policy or values. But Pentagon spokesman Ken bacon 
did not say there would be an investigation. The incident came to 
light after a wire service photographer took a picture of the missile.
