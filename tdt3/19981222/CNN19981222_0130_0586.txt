Experts say the name of a medication can be misleading. Dr. Steve 
Salvatore explains. When Marty suffered a heart attack four months 
ago, he thought it was a minor blockage. But he was wrong. I started 
getting concerned when they were running with me while I was on the 
gurney. Shades of "ER." He may be better, thanks to superaspirins. 
The drugs are allowing doctors to be more aggressive when opening 
the heart a procedure called angioplasty. We can take higher risk, 
sicker patients. We have a lot of clots in the arteries, and using 
these medicines, undo heart attacks. Superaspirins are inhibitors, 
which help prevent them from clumping. A clot is what causes heart 
attacks. These drugs also make platelets less sticky, but to a degree 
much greater than we've seen with just aspirin in the past. Researchers 
say platelet inhibitors are the next new way to treat heart patients. 
A new study in "the journal of the American medical association99 
association" says -- These compounds reduce the number of deaths in 
people coming to a hospital with either unstable angina, impeding 
heart attacks, or mild heart attacks, or undergoing balloon angioplasty 
procedures, by one death per thousand. And long-term benefits as well. 
We have noted significant reductions in the number of patients who 
experience either death, another heart attack, or a repeat visit to 
the hospital for another procedure, including balloon angioplasty 
or bypass surgery at up to six months. Numerous stidies confirm anti-platelets 
drugs are at risk for some patients. They're wondering whether this 
drug should be given to low-risk patients as well. Research is under 
way to examine them in pill form. They're currently only available 
by I.V. researchers are also considering them to help reduce and treat 
stroke. CNN, New York.
