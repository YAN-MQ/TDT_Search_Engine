The government on Tuesday was trying to locate a relative of ex-President 
Suharto who was granted citizenship in Jordan but still faces a kidnapping 
investigation at home. Former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto's younger 
brother said Tuesday that Prabowo was in Jordan's capital, Amman, 
undergoing medical treatment. ``Prabowo has been in Jordan for four 
months along with his family,'' Hashim Djojohadikusumo told reporters. 
Several months ago, Indonesian military investigators said they might 
court-martial Prabowo, a son-in-law of Suharto, for his alleged role 
in the abduction of nine political activists. Prabowo was commander 
of Indonesia's special forces when the pro-democracy activists were 
kidnapped and tortured earlier this year. He lost his job after the 
ouster in May of the authoritarian Suharto, who was dislodged by riots 
and protests. Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi said the government 
had asked its embassy in Amman to investigate the case of Prabowo, 
a onetime rising star in the Indonesian military whose career plummeted 
when Suharto's fortunes turned. Last week, Prabowo's father told a 
Jakarta tabloid that his son was in London. In Amman, the office of 
Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh confirmed Tuesday that Prabowo's bid 
for citizenship had been endorsed by a royal decree on Dec. 10. Hashim 
also confirmed the awarding of Jordanian citizenship, but added that 
it was only honorary in nature and his elder brother had no intention 
of abandoning his Indonesian nationality. He added that his family 
was proud about it because it was an honor from a foreign country. 
Prabowo is known to have close ties with Jordanian military officers 
with whom he conducted joint training exercises in Jakarta. Suharto's 
successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie, is implementing 
political reforms and the military has pledged to clean up its human 
rights record. Student protesters say the government is not moving 
fast enough on democratic change. A military court was scheduled on 
Wednesday to begin the trial of 11 members of the special forces who 
have been accused in the kidnappings of the activists.
