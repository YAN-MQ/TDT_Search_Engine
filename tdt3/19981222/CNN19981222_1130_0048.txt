This is "CNN Headline News." Good morning, I'm Linda Stouffer. Thank 
you for joining us. Some legal scholars and senators are bristling 
at a possible White House challenge to the impeachment process. A 
White House aid says some legal experts believe it may be unconstitutional 
for a new Congress to try the case. Mr. Clinton's legal team is also 
looking for a compromise with Congress that would allow him to finish 
his term. Senior Senate democrat Robert Byrd is hinting he could accept 
a censure proposal, but says, for the good of the nation, it must 
come from the senate, not the White House.
