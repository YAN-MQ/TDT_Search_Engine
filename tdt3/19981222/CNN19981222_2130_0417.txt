German railway authorities are beefing up security after recent acts 
of sabotage and a bomb threat. Similar attacks earlier this month 
were linked to extortionists, but police don't believe the most recent 
incidents are related. One man has been arrested, and several youths 
are being investigated for blocking rail lines. As a precaution, officials 
have equipped police with night vision equipment to look for signs 
of sabotage.
