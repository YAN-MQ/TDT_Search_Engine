Britain has again said the air raids it mounted with the United States 
against Iraq were highly successful. Today, Iraq has reported violations 
of its airspace by warplanes in the South of the country, but both 
London and Washington deny any involvement. Caroline Wyatt reports 
from Baghdad. Iraqi television and the country's official news agency 
quoted a military spokesman as saying that enemy warplanes had violated 
Iraqi airspace. It's another indication that tensions are high as 
the crisis between Iraq, America, and Britain continues. However, 
around a hundred UN aid workers are still due to return to the Iraqi 
capital later tonight to help supervise the oil-for-food program. 
Ordinary Iraqis say they will be welcomed back as long as their mission 
is aimed solely at helping the Iraqi people. Caroline Wyatt, BBC News, 
Baghdad.
