There are reports out of New York that the National Football League, 
Jets, have reached a new contract with quarterback Vinnie Testaverte. 
Local newspapers say Testaverte will receive a multi-year deal averaging 
$6 million per season, with a huge signing bonus. But head coach, 
Bill Parsell, says, "No such agreement has been struck." We have not 
agreed to the deal. We've discussed a lot of the major issues. There 
are no big disagreements on the major issues, OK? But, we have not 
completely discussed the logistics and the by-products of doing this 
deal, to my satisfaction. Testaverte has helped lead the Jets to their 
first division title since 1969. He leads the American Football Conference 
with a 61 percent pass completion average. Testaverte has tossed 25 
touchdown passes and only six interceptions.
