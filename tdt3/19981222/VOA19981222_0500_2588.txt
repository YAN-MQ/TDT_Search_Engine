The United States has confirmed that it has settled an eight-year 
dispute with Pakistan over that country's purchase of 28 jet fighter 
planes that Pakistan paid for but never received. The White House 
said Monday the United States will pay Pakistan nearly $470 million 
in cash and other benefits. In return, Pakistan will withdraw its 
claim to the F-16 aircraft. Delivery of the jets was stopped in 1990 
because of the U.S. arms embargo against Pakistan because of its nuclear 
program.
