Richard Branson and his ballooning crew may be having trouble flying 
over China, but Santa Claus and his crew had better steer clear of 
Cuba. The country's Communist government's has finally sanctioned 
Christmas as a public holiday, but that doesn't mean Santa's coming 
to town. An official Cuban newspaper is calling Santa Claus a potentially 
threatening symbol of U.S. cultural homogeny, mental colonization, 
and consumerism. The article asserts that the great bearded one -- 
and they don't mean Castro -- artificial snow, and the words "Merry 
Christmas" are inappropriate in tropical, socialist Cuba. It may be 
too late for the accusation of consumerism. Our own reporter says 
plastic Christmas trees in Havana are selling for $60 for a pop.
