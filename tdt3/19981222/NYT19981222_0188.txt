In an era when charm is a virtue too much lacking in the arts, it 
is no wonder that the Austrian mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager 
has caused heads to turn. She is, after all, a beguiling presence. 
With her sparkling persona and fresh good looks, she has delighted 
audiences throughout Europe and the United States. Yet her success 
stems from more than just beauty and breeding. She is a singer with 
the right stuff: a sumptuous, rather light-toned voice, which she 
uses intelligently and judiciously. Ms. Kirchschlager, at 33, has 
risen rapidly in the often ruthless world of operatic singing. Even 
more noteworthy, her success comes at a time when opera houses are 
flush with excellent mezzos. Yet thanks in large part to her rapport 
with audiences, Ms. Kirchschlager stands out. Thursday evening, she 
will make her New York Philharmonic debut at a New Year's Eve concert 
to be conducted by Kurt Masur and telecast live on PBS. But Cassandras 
who fear that fame has arrived too suddenly for Ms. Kirchschlager 
need not worry. In choosing her repertory, she shows an instinctive 
flair for what is right. A mezzo whose voice is more in the mold of 
a young Anne Sofie von Otter than a Jennifer Larmore, Ms. Kirchschlager 
mixes adventurousness with common sense when selecting projects. During 
the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center last summer, she took 
part in a concert version of Mozart's ``Idomeneo'' in a seldom-heard 
reworking by Richard Strauss, which is sung in German rather than 
Italian. ``It's very strange,'' she said of the project at the time. 
``It's 100 percent confusion.'' Her performance was anything but, 
earning praise from critics and a rapturous response from the audience. 
But it was especially her appearance at the festival's opening-night 
concert, a few days earlier, that inspired unusual accord among the 
critics. Both The New York Times and the Daily News described her 
singing of Mozart arias and Strauss songs as first rate. Gerard Schwarz, 
the festival's artistic director, conducted on those occasions and 
recently described Ms. Kirchschlager's performances as ``tremendous.'' 
She displayed a ``warm, rich, beautiful sound,'' he said, but her 
greatest gift was a natural musicianship that ``just feels right.'' 
Schwarz also conducted Ms. Kirchschlager's American operatic debut, 
as Octavian in Strauss' ``Rosenkavalier'' at the Seattle Opera in 
1997. A trouser role requiring both tonal beauty and winsomeness, 
the part is becoming widely associated with Ms. Kirchschlager, who 
in September made her Geneva Opera debut as Octavian. Soon, she may 
find herself in the company of such renowned interpreters of the role 
as Christa Ludwig and Frederica von Stade. Schwarz, having spent two 
months with Ms. Kirchschlager as she rehearsed and performed the part, 
called her ``the most extraordinary Octavian I've ever seen.'' ``It's 
her role,'' he added. New Yorkers now have the chance to judge for 
themselves. The first half of the Philharmonic program consists of 
excerpts from ``Der Rosenkavalier,'' with Ms. Kirchschlager joined 
by the sopranos Deborah Voigt, as the Marschallin, and Noemi Nadelmann, 
as Sophie. Ms. Kirchschlager sings an aria from Johann Strauss' operetta 
``Wiener Blut'' in the second half of the program, which she called 
``light with some substance.'' This is a formula she tends to favor. 
In November, in Lausanne, Switzerland, she portrayed the Composer 
in Richard Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos'' for the first time, and 
she has just finished her first Hansel in Humperdinck's ``Hansel und 
Gretel'' in Graz, Austria. (She will perform the role at the Seattle 
Opera in 2001, with Schwarz conducting.) But Mozart remains Ms. Kirchschlager's 
favorite composer, and not only because they were both born in Salzburg. 
``The fascinating thing about his music is that you have a view up 
to heaven,'' she said recently. ``It's perfect. It's so simple, so 
direct. He shows us how mankind is.'' Her Metropolitan Opera debut, 
as Annio in Mozart's ``Clemenza di Tito'' last year, was acclaimed 
by critics, and she will return to the Met in 2002 to sing the amorous 
page Cherubino in ``Le Nozze di Figaro,'' another trouser role in 
which she has been justly celebrated. She has also sung two roles 
in ``Cosi Fan Tutte,'' Dorabella and, perhaps more surprising, the 
saucy maid Despina. A budding opera star needs to keep her repertory 
growing, and Ms. Kirchschlager is trying hard. She took on six new 
roles last year and three this year. She will tackle two more next 
year: Valencienne in Lehar's ``Merry Widow'' and Silla in Pfitzner's 
``Palestrina.'' Ms. Kirchschlager is careful in choosing her parts, 
never tackling anything that might compromise her voice, but she is 
determined not to become predictable. She insists on artistic growth. 
``If you just do Verdi your whole life, even if you are fantastic, 
it would be boring,'' she said. ``The fascinating thing is to experience 
new things.'' In time, Ms. Kirchschlager affirmed, she would like 
to be involved in premieres of new works, but no such projects loom. 
She is content for now to add Kurt Weill's hard-edged ``Seven Deadly 
Sins'' to her repertory; she will sing it for the first time in April, 
in Vienna. For Ms. Kirchschlager, there are myriad connections to 
be made in music. ``When you do Weill, you profit in Mozart,'' she 
said. ``And when you do folk songs, you profit in Schubert.'' But 
if Ms. Kirchschlager has adopted an expansive approach in the opera 
house and on the concert stage, she has followed a different course 
in the recording studio. Unlike many of her peers, she has a tiny 
discography, though she signed an exclusive contract with Sony Classical 
in 1995. She has recorded no operas and only one recital album, a 
well-received disk of songs by Korngold, Mahler and Alma Mahler. She 
has no qualms about her spare recording schedule. In fact, she argues 
that the absence of a glut may make listeners appreciate her minuscule 
catalog all the more. ``I don't mind how many records other singers 
bring out in a year,'' she said. ``It doesn't affect me.'' That determination 
to go her own way artistically is a reflection of Ms. Kirchschlager's 
confident, sensible demeanor, says her friend the pianist Jean-Yves 
Thibaudet, who has accompanied her in some 20 recitals during the 
last four years. ``She is such an anti-diva person,'' Thibaudet said. 
``She is utterly natural, and she sings the way she is. Her whole 
approach is very organic, the way music should be.'' Thibaudet, who 
sometimes travels great distances just to hear Ms. Kirchschlager perform, 
says that working with her is a constant pleasure and that the two 
of them easily find common musical ground. ``I probably shouldn't 
tell people this, but most of the time, we rehearse a program just 
once, because we never fight,'' he explained. ``Also, that leaves 
an incredible spontaneity to the performance.'' Ms. Kirchschlager 
lives in Vienna with her husband, Hans-Peter Kammerer, a baritone, 
and their son, Felix. Although she and Kammerer will appear together 
in a production of ``The Merry Widow'' in February at the Vienna State 
Opera, Ms. Kirchschlager finds working with him nerve-racking. ``It's 
not so nice to sing together,'' she said, ``because each of us has 
to worry about the other as well as ourselves.'' Given her sweet, 
unaffected personal manner, to say nothing of her obvious and abundant 
talents, it is hard to imagine that Ms. Kirchschlager has a dark side. 
Yet a secret lurks beneath her friendly bearing and glowing tan. ``I 
know it would not be wise for me to do something like crossover, but 
I love that stuff,'' she said, almost guiltily. Then, as if unable 
to stop herself, she gushed, ``I would love to sing with Michael Bolton.'' 
Well, nobody's perfect.
