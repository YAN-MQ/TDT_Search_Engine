Unless drastic improvements are made, the New York City school system 
will fail to insure that students in its worst schools pass new, tougher 
high school standards imposed by the state, a report from a watchdog 
group says. The Public Education Association, a nonprofit organization 
that monitors school performance, assembled data from a number of 
sources and projected that most students in New York City would not 
be able to earn a high school diploma under the new state mandates, 
which within the next five years will require students to pass Regents 
exams covering English, math, American history, global studies and 
science. Previously the Regents exams were taken mainly by college-bound 
students and were not required for graduation. Schools Chancellor 
Rudy Crew issued a statement Tuesday night disputing the report. He 
called the prediction that most students would not measure up to the 
graduation requirements ``reckless,'' and said that other organizations 
had found New York leading other urban districts on ``virtually every 
performance indicator.'' The new report shows that students now perform 
far below the new state performance standards. In 1997, according 
to the report's analysis of State Education Department data, just 
18 percent of city students passed the Regents exam in biology, compared 
with 58 percent in the rest of the state, and 39 percent passed the 
English exam, compared with 65 percent outside of the city. Both will 
be mandatory for a high school diploma in coming years. The report 
was sponsored by the Center for Civic Innovation at the Manhattan 
Institute, a conservative research organization, and the Program on 
Education and Civil Society, a research group at New York University. 
Raymond J. Domanico, executive director of the Public Education Association, 
said that taken together, the data should provide parents and policy 
makers greater resolve to reverse the school system's lag behind the 
state and, in some cases, the nation. ``This is a wake-up call for 
the city,'' Domanico said in an interview. In the 14 lowest-performing 
community school districts, which are also the poorest, 37.8 percent 
of third graders read at or above grade level, while the rest of the 
32 districts averaged 56.5 percent _ a gap that has hardly changed 
in the last three years, according to the report. Between 1989 and 
1997 the percentage of students who earned a high school diploma within 
four years increased to 45 percent from 39 percent, and those who 
earned a diploma within seven years increased to 60 percent from 55 
percent. Although Domanico lauded the improvement, he said it was 
astounding that 40 percent of the students did not earn a diploma.
