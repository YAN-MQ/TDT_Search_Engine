They may not be Santa's elves, but craftsmen in one German town are 
carrying on a centuries'-old tradition. Denise Dillon takes us for 
a visit. It's as if time stood still in this small German village. 
Visitors from throughout Europe and America come to seiffen, to enjoy 
a Tradition that goes back nearly 400 years -- producing hand-carved 
wooden figures and toys. There are no assembly lines, no machines, 
just the artists hard at work, carefully creating each piece. These 
small trees can be produced in only two minutes, and are featured 
prominently in the works. Our figures are different from others in 
terms of the way they look. Each craftsman in the village is recognized 
by his typical style. Miniature toys have been made here since 1803. 
They're carved out of a specially prepared wooden ring. About 60 animals 
and other figures can be cut from one ring, then each is carefully 
painted by hand. These are all family-owned workshops that open their 
doors to visitors, so they can follow the manufacturing process step 
by step. Since almost 40 years ago, we show how to manufacture this 
beautiful handcraft. Christmastime is the busiest time of the year 
for seiffen, the time when visitors come to peek through the windows 
and enjoy the town's old-fashioned atmosphere. Denise Dillon, "Headline 
News."
