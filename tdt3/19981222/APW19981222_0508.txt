Fire broke out after someone poured gasoline on the lower floor of 
one of Stockholm's main department stores as it was crowded with Christmas 
shoppers Tuesday, injuring at least two people. Police said they arrested 
one person in connection with the fire, but details were not immediately 
available, the Swedish news agency TT reported. The store faces the 
Hoetorget square, directly across from the city's main concert hall. 
Firemen clolsed off the square, which includes about 20 covered stalls 
for vendors of produce and leather and woolen goods. One of those 
injured was taken to hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation. The 
extent of the others' injuries were not immediately known. The fire 
caused little visible damage to the store and was declared extinguished 
about 45 minutes after the alarm
