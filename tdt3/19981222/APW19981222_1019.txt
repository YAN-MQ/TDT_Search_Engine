Finns have indulged their famed infatuation with technology so deeply 
that there are now more cellular phones than regular telephone subscriptions 
in the country. The Ministry of Transport and Communications said 
Tuesday that 56 out every 100 people in the country own cellular phones, 
and more are buying every day. An estimated 60,000 new subscribers 
come every month, the ministry said. That puts the number of mobile 
subscriptions slightly above the 2.9 million fixed-line phone subscriptions, 
which includes both business and private users, the ministry said. 
``In 1997, we made a cautious prediction to cross 50 percent coverage 
by the year 2000 - but it happened in August this year. The growth 
has been incredibly strong,'' said Mikael Akermarck, a researcher 
at the ministry. Mobile phone maker Nokia, which claims to be the 
world's largest, is based in Finland. The growth in fixed phone line 
subscriptions has leveled off completely and many households now own 
several mobile phones, he added.
