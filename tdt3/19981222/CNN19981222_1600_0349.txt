Four house republicans are joining in the call for a censure of president 
clinton. Sherwood Boehlert and Benjamin Gilman of New York, James 
Greenwood of pennsylvania and Michael castle of Delaware all voted 
for impeachment. But in a letter to Senate majority leader Trent Lott 
they say, despite their votes, they believe a remedy short of removal 
is in order. The lawmakers say the Senate should consider the president's 
false testimony, the degree to which his conduct threatens the integrity 
and functioning of government and the will of the American voters. 
Democratic senator Carl Levin is questioning why the republican house 
members didn't speak out earlier. I'm disturbed that they didn't say 
that before they voted in the house. That seems to me it would have 
been a more timely place and time to make that point. I'm glad they 
finally said it if that's what they believe, but I sure wish they 
would have said that to their colleagues and to themselves, prior 
to the vote in the house.
