European champion Germany will replace World Cup winner France in 
next year's Confederations' Cup in Mexico, FIFA said Tuesday. The 
tournament will take place July 24 to Aug. 4 _ four days earlier than 
planned _ to accommodate the Germans, soccer's governing body said. 
After weeks of debate over the schedule and to the anger of FIFA and 
local organizers, France withdrew because of clashes with its domestic 
and European obligations. The French move reflected a feeling by many 
European squads that the Confederations Cup is an unnecessary feature 
on an overcrowded soccer calendar. In addition to the world champion 
and host nation, FIFA invited continental champions Brazil, New Zealand, 
Egypt and Saudi Arabia along with South American and CONCACAF runners-up 
Bolivia and the United States to participate in the competition. ``FIFA 
consulted the German Football Association who have now confirmed their 
participation following France's definite withdrawal,'' FIFA said 
in a sttement. Germany will play in Group B in Guadalajara against 
Brazil, the United States and New Zealand. FIFA initially moved the 
eight-nation event from Jan. 8-20 to July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France. 
The French federation said it accepted this, but then changed its 
mind because the French national league begins its 1999-2000 championship 
on July 28. France then asked for the competition to be moved to the 
start of the summer. But FIFA rejected the request. South America's 
Copa Libertadores isn't scheduled to end until June 16, and the Copa 
America begins June 29 and runs through July 8.
