Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma has signed a decree canceling late 
tax fines for companies that pay all their 1998 taxes by next February, 
a news report said Tuesday. The decree, signed Monday, was the latest 
in a series of measures Ukraine's cash-strapped government has taken 
to improve its chronically poor tax collection. The decree will become 
effective in a month unless parliament revokes it, the independent 
Ukrainian News agency said. Lawmakers are unlikely to oppose the decree. 
The nationwide tax debt in Ukraine skyrocketed this year from January's 
2.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.09 billion at the time) to 10.2 billion 
hryvna (dlrs 3 billion) as of Dec. 1, with most companies trying to 
escape the suffocating tax burden by declaring lower incomes, putting 
off tax payments _ or by not paying taxes at all. Economic reforms 
in Ukraine have proceeded slowly since it gained independence with 
the 1991 Soviet collapse. The government has failed to stop the continuing 
economic decline, which has left most enterprises loss-making and 
unable to pay their bills _ or taxes.
