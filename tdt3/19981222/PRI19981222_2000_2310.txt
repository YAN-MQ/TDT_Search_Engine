... for today's geography puzzler, we'll take you back to 1946. That's 
the year young Simeon and his family fled their Balkan homeland after 
the Communists took hold following World War II. But his wasn't just 
any family. It was the royal family of this place, once ruled by Simeon's 
father, Boris III, and by his grandpa, King Ferdinand, before that. 
In the home he left behind, Simeon's now known as King Simeon II, 
but in the country he fled to, he's hardly one of those regal types 
wondering what do the simple folk do. You could say he's one of them, 
living in Madrid, working as a business consultant, a noble profession 
by any estimation. Now 61 years old, King Simeon II is about to give 
himself a pretty dandy Christmas gift. For the first time in more 
than 50 years, he's leaving Spain to spend Christmas at home, the 
place his family fled when Communism moved in. The question is just 
where is his home for the holidays? Stay tuned.
