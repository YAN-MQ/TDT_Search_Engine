The top 10 U.S. college basketball teams have remained unchanged in 
the latest poll of coaches that was released on Monday. The only movement 
of significance in the top 10 was at number three where the undefeated 
Cincinnati Bear Cats received one additional vote for number one after 
winning three games during the past week. Idle Connecticut with a 
perfect record of eight wins so far is the top-ranked team, followed 
by Duke. Third-ranked Cincinnati is ahead of defending national champion 
Kentucky and Maryland. North Carolina sits at number six followed 
by Stanford and Perdue. Arizona and Indiana round out the top ten 
this week.
