The White House continues to search for interest in Congress, for 
a way to avoid placing an impeachment of President Clinton on trial 
in the Senate, for covering up his relationship with a former White 
House intern. Several House republicans, who voted Saturday to impeach 
the president on perjury and obstruction of justice charges, now say 
they favor a censure resolution. As correspondent, Nick Simeone at 
the White House reports, one Senate democrat says a deal may be close 
at hand. The White House has been hoping lawmakers can reach a compromise 
that would spare the nation what could be additional months of lengthy, 
and perhaps embarrassing, testimony about the president's relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. As he was leaving budget talks at the White 
House, Tuesday, democratic senator, Christopher Dodd, told reports 
an agreement that most senators could support may be close and that 
the next few days will be critical. What seems to be emerging, Mike, 
is that there are not the votes to convict this president for impeachment. 
There are the votes to censure this president. That seems to be a 
bipartisan consensus that is emerging. If that is the case, and it 
appears to be, then it seems to me that it is in the best interest 
of the Senate to move to that result, sooner rather than later. White 
House spokesman Jill Lockhart says the fact that several republicans 
in the House of Representatives say they favor censure rather than 
placing the president on trial in the Senate, is a positive sign that 
members of Congress want to put this matter behind them. Nick Simeone, 
VOA News at the White House.
