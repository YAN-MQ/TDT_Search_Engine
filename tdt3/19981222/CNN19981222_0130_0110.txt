Two former presidents are calling for an end to impeachment proceedings 
against President Clinton. In an article in "the New York Times," 
presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy carter say impeachment has already 
"brought profound disgrace" to Mr. clinton. They say the Senate should 
agree on a censure resolution. Mr. Ford and Mr. Carter referenced 
examples of pardon and Clemency in their own administrations. They 
say the Senate has a similar opportunity to promote healing.
