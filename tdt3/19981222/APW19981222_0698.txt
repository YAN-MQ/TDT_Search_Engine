Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder rebuked his environment minister Tuesday 
in a dispute over nuclear energy, provoking the first sharp clash 
in the new center-left government. Schroeder accused the minister, 
Juergen Trittin, of jeopardizing talks with utility firms on shutting 
down German nuclear power plants with his own anti-nuclear campaign. 
Earlier, Trittin announced he was firing the government's two advisory 
panels on nuclear safety and indicated he would install new members 
less favorable to nuclear power. Schroeder said Trittin, a member 
of the environmentalist Greens party, had not cleared the move with 
him. ``Everyone is called upon not to substitute self-important attitudes 
and the symbolism of party politics for dealing with the political 
issues,'' said Schroeder, clearly aiming at Trittin. Schroeder, whose 
Social Democrats won September elections, has pledged to put Germany 
on course to shut down its 19 nuclear plants. But in an interview 
published Tuesday, Schroeder rejected pressure for a fast timetable 
from the Greens, his junior government partner. ``Some people's ideas 
of making it by 2004 are mistaken,'' he told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine 
Zeitung newspaper. ``This will take significantly longer.'' At the 
same time, he denied reports that he has agreed to give German utilities 
at least 20 years to scrap nuclear power. He said he remains committed 
to seeking a shutdown strategy in talks with power companies starting 
next month. German media have reported that the two sides reached 
an understanding on a timetable in preliminary talks last week. Schroeder 
has said he could support 20 years, but one report said he had agreed 
to give power companies a longer grace period so they will renounce 
damage claims for lost earnings. The power industry last week called 
for 40 years as the only way for the government to avoid damage claims, 
which the industry has estimated at up to 80 billion marks (dlrs 48 
billion). Schroeder insisted there was no accord yet. ``I don't want 
to pin myself down on the time period,'' he told the newspaper.
