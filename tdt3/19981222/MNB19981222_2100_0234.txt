But first, in Washington today, senators on both sides of the aisle 
continued to work behind the scenes on the timing and scope of the 
pending impeachment trial of President Clinton but they also received 
unexpected words of advice from a member of the house G.O.P. leadership. 
Chip Reid has been tracking that development. We're talking about 
Tom delay, of course. He is the man who absolutely refused to concede 
defeat after that election back in November when it looked like the 
president was going to escape impeachment. He is responsible for pushing 
the process forward and receives much of the credit or blame, depending 
on which side of the aisle you're on, to keeping the impeachment process 
going to the point where they got the vote they wanted, to impeach 
the president and now that the process has moved to the senate it 
is still delay getting the headlines. He issued a press release today 
saying there are still reams of evidence and that the senators should 
spend plenty of time in the evidence room and if they do, 67 votes 
could appear out of thin air. We know what he's talking about from 
recent reports. Allegations made in the Paula Jones case regarding 
three women, and the republicans who have looked at this material, 
still under seal in the house documents room, believe it lends credence 
to a pattern of behavior by the president, women he had sexual relations 
with and allegedly participated in an effort to obstruct justice to 
keep them quiet. Today Tom Daschle was asked about that. Here's what 
he said. I understand that congressman delay has now started to put 
pressure on members of the Senate on the way he views the process 
and what he would like to see happen. I just hope we don't allow the 
poisonous climate that was so evident in the house to rervade the 
Senate and we don't need his advice or any other advice. I think this 
is a matter left to the Senate and I would hope all people took that 
advice very seriously. Now, the White House calls this a classic snear 
campaign by Mr. delay, that it is a fundamental violation of due process 
to try to impeach the president and try to remove him from office 
on the basis of information that hasn't even seen the light of day. 
Chip Reid in Washington tonight. Thanks a lot. You bet.
