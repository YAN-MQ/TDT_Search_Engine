If you still haven't bought all your holiday gifts, help could be 
just a Few keystrokes away. Ann Kellan explains, in this edition of 
tech trends. If holiday shopping makes you dizzy, or if you put it 
all off till the last minute, there are still gift certificates online 
that can be sent to you or a person you choose. You can buy directly 
from various stores' web sites. And now, there are web sites that 
give you a selection. I can now search by the name of a company. I 
can search by location. I can search by type of company and then by 
category. So if I want an apparel company, an automotive, books and 
music, restaurants, specialty stores, sporting, travel and wine and 
spirits. At some sites, the giver chooses the store where the gift 
certificate will be used. At other sites, a person who receives the 
gift certificate can choose from a specified list of stores where 
it can be spent. The new player in this game is webcertificate.com, 
a web site where the gift-giving and the shopping are done online. 
The giver fills out a form and, for a fee, the company E-mails the 
recipient that they've been given a virtual gift certificate. Once 
recipients open that E-mail and verify who they are, they click to 
the webcertificate site. They get an account number. That serves as 
a debit card, letting them shop anywhere, as long as it's online. 
The part that's really unique and the part that we have a patent pending 
on is the ability from one person to send, via E-mail, to another 
person, monetary value that they can use anywhere online. Webcertificate.com 
acts as a bank, keeping gift certificate money accounts. Now, recipients 
have one year to spend the money online. If they don't spend that 
money, they can apply it to their credit card balance. The sites can 
be used for any number of events, be it birthdays, graduations or 
the next time you're running around at the last minute looking for 
that perfect gift to buy. Ann Kellan, CNN.
