The Italian government, unions and employers on Tuesday reached preliminary 
agreement on an arrangement aimed at keeping down labor costs in hopes 
of stimulating job creation. By eliminating some of the tax contributions 
employers must now make for each employee, the new accord will reduce 
the cost of labor and, it is hoped, generate investment aimed at fighting 
unemployment, which runs about 12.5 nationally and roughly double 
that in parts of the south. While the pact does not include figures, 
the head of the Italian industrialists' group Confindustria, Giorgio 
Fossa, said the aim is to shave the cost of labor by around 1.2 percent 
by the year 2003. In the previous, 1993 accord, wage increases were 
linked to government inflation targets and not to real inflation. 
Confindustria note the latest accord would take into account Europe-wide 
inflation. By helping to fight inflation and reduce labor disputes, 
the 1993 back was important to Italy's qualification for European 
economic and monetary union. As an additional stimulus to investment, 
the new pact calls for tax reductions on company profits which are 
reinvested in machinery and equipment. Italian Labor Minister Antonio 
Bassolino said final approval of the pact should take place by the 
end of January, once it has been examined by the parliament and the 
membership of both union and employer organizations. Italian Communist 
leaders criticized aspects of the pact, contending that workers would 
lose bargaining power. Effectiveness of pact will also be assessed 
twice a year. As in the 1993 accord, wages will be negotiated every 
four years. The government pledged to provide the equivalent of nearly 
1 billion dollars' worth of job training over the next three years.
