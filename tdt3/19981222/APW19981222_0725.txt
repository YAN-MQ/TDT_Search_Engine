Argentina's Supreme Court has freed an Iranian woman detained in connection 
with the bombings of the Israeli embassy and a Jewish community center 
here. Lawyers for Nasrim Mokhtari, 43, said she had been released 
late Monday for ``lack of evidence,'' but was ordered to remain in 
the country while investigators continue their work. Mokhtari was 
picked up Dec. 2 at the Buenos Aires international airport after a 
flight from Paris. Local reports said she was questioned nine times 
by investigators and repeatedly denied charges linking her to the 
1992 Israeli embassy bombing and the 1994 attack on the community 
center. U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies suspect have attributed 
the bombings to Iranian-supported terrorist groups. The attacks claimed 
a total of 114 lives. Investigators arrested Mokhtari after hearing 
the testimony of a Brazilian, Wilson dos Santos, who was arrested 
last month in Brazil. He reportedly told authorities he knew of the 
plans for both bombings through Mokhtari, who he claimed had terrorist 
links. Dos Santos has said he alerted Argentine diplomatic officials 
in 1994 of an imminent bombing but claimed officials didn't take him 
seriously.
