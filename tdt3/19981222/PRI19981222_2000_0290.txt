Another prominent Chinese dissident, Qin Yongmin, has been sentenced 
to 12 years in jail for trying to set up an independent political 
party. He is the third dissident to be jailed this week. Carrie Gracie 
reports from Beijing on the government's view of the case. The Chinese 
foreign ministry spokesman said the three men in question were not 
legitimately enjoying their rights to freedom of speech and association 
but, instead, plotting subversion with the help of China's foreign 
enemies. Punishment of such criminals, he said, was necessary so that 
the rest of the Chinese populate might enjoy the human rights guaranteed 
under their constitution. The spokesman refused to answer a question 
about possible disagreement within the Chinese leadership over the 
handling of political dissent, but what is clear is that those who 
believe in taking a tough line now have the upper hand. Carrie Gracie, 
BBC, Beijing.
