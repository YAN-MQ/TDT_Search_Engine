CLEARWATER, Fla. _ ``So, you want to know about my love life?'' said 
Sophie Silverman, 85 years old and twice a widow, climbing out of 
the pool and settling into a lounge chair at her retirement community, 
On Top Of The World. She pushed her oversized purple sunglasses halfway 
down her nose. ``It stinks.'' Not that she isn't trying. Mrs. Silverman 
is out there, as they say in the singles world. Here is her latest 
personal ad in the monthly Senior Voice: ``JWWF (Jewish white widowed 
female), honest, attractive, ISO (in search of) happy, healthy and 
physically fit soul mate, 65-75 to give me back my life. I like going 
out dancing, dining, travel, and would like a pleasant, romantic man 
for LTR (long-term relationship).'' Mrs. Silverman is an optimist 
as well as a romantic. Plenty of men respond to her ads. They call, 
she puts on her best smile and meets them for coffee at the Burger 
King on U.S. 19 and Sunset Point Road, a prime first-date spot, and 
she never hears from them again. It seems that they, too, want someone 
younger. ``They don't want me, I'm old and gray,'' said Mrs. Silverman, 
who happens to be a bottle blonde who works out at the gym and looks 
a trim 75. Where do bald men with arthritic knees get off acting like 
this? It's a universal lament among single women that all the good 
men are taken. At On Top of the World, the women add, ``Or dead.'' 
After age 75, according to the census, there are four single women 
for every single man. The dating game never stops. Indeed, for couples 
who move to retirement communities, it resumes after decades on the 
sidelines after one spouse dies _ just when the survivor is looking 
his or her age. The need for companionship, tenderness, love and, 
yes, sex, remains as important as ever, but the rules of the game 
have changed. Not only women, but men, too, are racing the clock. 
At On Top Of The World and other Florida retirement communities in 
Clearwater, St. Petersburg and Tampa, it is clear that as always in 
matters of love and sex, there is a tremendous range in opinions and 
desire. But men generally want younger women more than ever, and can 
get them because of the sharp disparity in their numbers. Plenty of 
women, like Mrs. Silverman, want younger men, but only rarely do they 
succeed. At Bringing People Together, a Florida dating service that 
specializes in senior citizens, a woman who answered the phone said 
that while they helped men into their 90s, they tried not to take 
women over 78. Yet while men who got the cold shoulder from the girls 
back in high school may fare better in their 70s and 80s, that lasts 
only until they lose their driver's license _ no one takes the bus 
on dates down here _ or lose their health. No one is eager to be stuck 
with someone who has to be nursed six months down the road. Everyone 
is vulnerable. How does someone go on a date after being married to 
the same man or woman for half a century? Kathy Beck, who founded 
Senior Connection, a South Florida newspaper that publishes personal 
ads, says her office is barraged with questions by nervous clients: 
What should they say? How should they act? When do they sleep together? 
Kenneth Bruwelheide, 79, made his way to the Senior Connection office 
in Brandon, near Tampa, five years ago, shortly after the death of 
his wife of 52 years, Betty. ``I was very awkward,'' recalled Bruwelheide, 
a retired plumber. ``I broke down and cried right in front of them. 
I felt like I was cheating on my wife.'' Bruwelheide placed an ad 
modestly describing himself as a widowed male, in his mid-70s, in 
search of a companion who likes bingo and short trips. ``I got 57 
answers,'' he said. ``There's a lot more widows than widowers. I think 
it's a shame. The men died too young, the women sit there sorry, hurting, 
nobody to help them.'' One letter he answered was from May McCulloch, 
a widow four years his junior. A year and a half ago, Mrs. McCulloch 
moved in with him. ``I call her Dear,'' Bruwelheide said. ``I have 
somebody to talk to, somebody to say, `What are we going to have for 
supper?' I cook half the time, she cooks half the time.'' Is it love? 
``I'm a little slow on that,'' he said. ``When I say `love,' I'm thinking 
of Betty.'' Every Wednesday afternoon in St. Petersburg, hundreds 
of men and women, many in their 70s and 80s, gather at the tea dance 
at the Coliseum, which bills itself as the finest climate-controlled 
ballroom in the South. As couples fox-trotted to the music of an orchestra. 
Charlene Speaker, in a long flowered skirt, lacy blouse and pearl 
earrings, waited to be asked to dance. Her husband died five years 
ago. ``I don't want a marriage, just a companion,'' said Mrs. Speaker, 
who allows only that she is past 65. ``Someone who's loyal.'' Mrs. 
Speaker has been dating someone, but she is well aware that she does 
not have her pick of men the way she did in her youth. ``The men want 
younger women,'' she said, ``but what are they going to do with them?'' 
Meanwhile, short, solicitous, smooth-stepping Neil Oliviero has come 
into his own at 82. Oliviero, the former owner of a dress factory, 
is one of the most popular men on the floor. ``The trouble is, I won't 
commit,'' Oliviero, who is divorced, said with genuine sadness. He 
is still trying to work through his last serious relationship, with 
a woman named Dorothy, who died nine years ago. ``Did I love Dorothy?'' 
he mused aloud. ``What is love?'' The Coliseum is a long way from 
Evander Childs High School and the Bronx, where Oliviero failed miserably 
with the opposite sex. ``To date a little runt like me, they'd be 
embarrassed,'' he said, taking a break after the tango. ``My social 
success is a vengeance against everybody.'' The Singles Club at On 
Top Of The World is a poor place to meet men: Its 200 members are 
overwhelmingly women. But some women, of course, do beat the odds. 
``When I moved to Top of the World six years ago, I said to my friend 
Irene, `What about men?''' said Sally Pearl, 63, a retired junior 
high school teacher from Long Island who is divorced. ``She said, 
`Don't even think about it.''' Yet both Mrs. Pearl and her friend, 
Irene Hartwell, 83, found companions. Mrs. Pearl was talking about 
men and dating over fruit and chicken salads at a restaurant the other 
afternoon with Joyce Wohl, a past president of the On Top Of The World 
singles club, and three other women. Mrs. Wohl, a retired social worker 
who declined to give her age, said she had been on one date since 
her husband died nearly seven years ago. ``Yech, it was a bummer,'' 
she said. ``The movie was interesting. He was a drip.'' Florence, 
a widow who revealed her age (77) but asked to be identified by only 
her first name (she thought her family might deem it inappropriate 
for her to be discussing such matters), recalled the humiliation of 
her dinner with an 83-year-old man who told her ``all about how he 
wanted to date this younger woman.'' What would be her idea of the 
perfect man at this point in her life? Florence said she had taken 
care of her husband for 14 years before he died. She had loved him, 
but it is not something she wants to go through again. She smiled 
slyly, then said, ``I would like a note from his doctor stating that 
he's healthy _ or if he isn't, that he only has six months to live.'' 
Her companions whooped with laughter. They could have been any group 
of women anywhere, indulging in a favorite pastime: trashing men. 
They giggled over the single men at On Top Of The World: ``All they 
want is a nurse with a purse.'' But behind the brave and brittle wisecracks, 
they were serious. ``I would love to fall in love again,'' Nancy Nazar 
volunteered. Florence nodded, and said. ``So would I.'' It is not 
that they necessarily want to remarry. Indeed, after years of taking 
care of husbands and children, the widows of On Top Of The World and 
other retirement communities make it clear that they relish their 
independence. Many of them mention marriage and cooking in the same 
breath, and say they would not want to cook for a man again. They 
have plenty to do without cooking, they say. They stay in shape with 
brisk walks in the morning, they go out to lunch, they take trips, 
they join clubs, they volunteer, they keep up with their children. 
``I've spent my whole life taking care of people,'' said Joanne Golder, 
62, who moved to On Top Of The World with her husband, Mort, and was 
widowed nearly two years ago. ``This is my time to do what I want 
for myself.'' Stanley Tucker, a 76-year-old widower, has been dating 
a widow four years younger. ``Even my mother and my daughter say she's 
too old for me,'' Tucker said over breakfast at the Family Restaurant 
on Sunset Point Road, around the corner from On Top Of The World. 
``I would like a woman 55 to 68,'' said Tucker, a retired mechanical 
engineer who excels at ballroom dancing. ``It will make me feel good. 
I feel they'll be more lively.'' Does he realize that in this market 
he is a hot commodity? ``Oh, absolutely,'' he said. But he has his 
own insecurities. He, too, feels compelled to lie about his age. ``I 
can get away with 65 to 68,'' he said. If he owned up to 76, he said, 
``I feel I'd be rejected.'' Jack Beller was at the pool at On Top 
of the World, talking about his continuing argument with his friend 
Sophie Silverman _ and they are just friends, both say. ``I can't 
make her understand the difference between love and companionship,'' 
Beller said. ``In my opinion, companionship is more important than 
love.'' Beller is 80; his wife of 46 years, Florence, died 15 months 
ago. She had Alzheimer's disease, and for six years he took care of 
her. Now, he wears her wedding ring on his pinky finger, and tells 
strangers how much he loved her. But meanwhile Beller, who still works 
as a consultant in industrial physics and has a condo full of books 
by Vladimir Nabokov and Thomas Mann, says he enjoys the company of 
women, taking them to dinner and classical music concerts and yes, 
to bed. ``My sister, who's 72, says to me, `Get some condoms,''' he 
said. ``I said, `OK,' but I haven't yet.'' What about AIDS? ``I'm 
80 years old. What's going to happen to me? Am I going to die at 140?'' 
Mrs. Silverman said later: ``Jack gets all the women. He can drive 
at night.''
