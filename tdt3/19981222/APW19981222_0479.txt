Bulgaria's security services have blocked an attempt to export locally-manufactured, 
protable rockets to an undisclosed African country which is under 
an international arms embargo, an official said Tuesday. Kiril Radev, 
head of Bulgaria's anti-organized crime service, refused to provide 
any further details because the operation is still underway. Radev 
said agents seized the shipment this fall in cooperation with ``specialized 
services'' of the United States and Britain. ``This is an extremely 
serious case,'' Radev said. ``The plane which was to be loaded with 
those weapons had landed in Bulgaria.'' Portable antitank and antiaircraft 
rockets are some of the products in which Bulgaria's arms industry 
has specialized since the Soviet era.
