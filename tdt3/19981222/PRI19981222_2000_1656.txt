You're listening to THE WORLD. Don't forget you can join us anytime 
on line at www.theworld.org. This is PRI, Public Radio International. 
I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come on THE WORLD, Washington rethinks 
its policy toward China, and the Japanese go wild over Santa. They're 
even crowding Christmas Eve mass. There are churches that beforehand 
kind of give out tickets to the Catholics which would allow them entrance 
into the church. Otherwise, they couldn't get in. Also, dance music 
from Madagascar. First, though, this news. For THE WORLD, I'm Derrick 
Stoffel in the BBC Newsroom in London.
