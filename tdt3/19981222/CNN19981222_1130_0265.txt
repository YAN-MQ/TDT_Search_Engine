Chinese authorities ordered a balloon team trying to set a world record 
to land after the balloon crossed into China's territory with no permission. 
But the team's organizers say they can't land right away because it 
is too dangerous to land in the rugged terrain at night. Steve Fossett 
and lindstrom are trying to circumstance the globe nonstop. They strayed 
off course because of a variety of problems. Organizers apologized 
and said they're trying to head south as quickly as possible.
