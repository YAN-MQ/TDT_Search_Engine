Mount Rainier's snowy peak lends its spectacular beauty to Seattle 
but also adds a touch of Northwest noir to the landscape. She is, 
after all, a volcano. Rainier has such a presence that when the city's 
famous clouds lift, people offer this simple report to one another: 
``The mountain is out.'' Thus it is not surprising that the awesome 
mountain also has loomed large in the artistic consciousness, so much 
so that a group of students and teachers at the University of Washington 
once declared that an art student ``should not graduate from the university 
without dealing with the image of Mount Rainier in some way.'' But 
while everyone sees Rainier, many artists clearly find it far from 
easy to take their own measure of this familiar icon. ``It was so 
massive and reverence-inspiring that at first I thought it was part 
of the clouds and that it wasn't a real mountain,'' said Joel A. Lee, 
one of the artists whose work is on display here. Lee's acrylic on 
poplar wood is one of the works in ``The View From Here: 100 Artists 
Mark the Centennial of Mount Rainier National Park,'' a show at the 
Seafirst Gallery in the public atrium of the Columbia Seafirst Center, 
Seattle's tallest building. Some of the pieces evoke the mountain's 
majesty, some are whimsical, while others explore its potential for 
destruction. They include everything from a 19th-century oil painting 
to a sculpture carved from Rainier's glacial ice (to be diligently 
returned after the show is over, since nothing is supposed to be taken 
permanently from a national park). A few of the artists know the mountain 
from having climbed to its 14,410-foot summit. One, Chet Edward Hanson, 
a photographer, went for a hike on Rainier's Angel Trail 13 months 
ago and disappeared; his body has never been found. Others only know 
it, as most people here do, as a powerful landmark in the distance. 
Two of the artists, creators of photographs from early this century, 
are unknown. The show and its title would seem to have been inspired 
by Hokusai's famous ``100 Views of Mount Fuji,'' the woodblock print 
masterpieces that the Japanese artist created more than a century 
and a half ago. It is to travel, in between its display here and elsewhere 
in Washington State, to Japan to help celebrate the establishment 
of an official ``sister mountain'' relationship between Fuji and Rainier. 
That designation was agreed to by the national park services of both 
nations. But in reality the idea for the exhibition had much more 
prosaic origins, concedes Peggy Weiss, the show's curator and the 
director of the Seafirst Gallery, a nonprofit arm of the Bank of America. 
A few years ago she was struck by a photograph by Alan Berner titled 
``Supermall,'' which depicts the opening of a shopping mall near here. 
A group of businessmen is seen celebrating the event; the mall's entrance 
is adorned with a kitschy cutout image of Rainier, fireworks blazing 
from the volcano's peak, one of thousands of ways that Rainier is 
used commercially. ``It just got me thinking about all the ways that 
Rainier gets depicted,'' said Ms. Weiss, who found the photograph 
both amusing and provocative and included it in the show. She also 
has solicited music and poetry. ``The point here is to get not just 
the beauty shot of Rainier, but the unique view that artists have 
on this,'' she said. There are 100 unique views in the show, which 
will continue until Jan. 15 at the Seafirst Gallery, before part of 
it will be on display at the Seattle-Tacoma airport. While there are 
plenty of beauty shots, including Sanford Gifford's 1874 ``Mount Rainier,'' 
a landscape that Ms. Weiss borrowed from the Seafirst Bank chairman's 
office, many other pieces are wildly fanciful or spring from fascination 
with the mountain's darker side. In Andrew Keating's ``Mount Rainier 
Mona Lisa,'' a 1974 sketch, Rainier is an ornamental hat on a woman's 
head. For a work titled ``Out of Sight, Out of Mind,'' Lou Cabeen, 
an art professor at the University of Washington, assembled 100 postcards 
of Mount Rainier, the sort of tourist shots taken at sunset on clear 
summer days. But most of the year here, the weather interferes with 
views of Rainier. So Ms. Cabeen humorously posted circular white stickers, 
with words like ``rain,'' ``clouds,'' ``fog'' and ``haze'' over the 
summit in 70 of the 100 postcards. The dark side is explored in a 
1980 cut-wood assemblage by Bill Whipple titled ``Mount Rainier's 
Revenge.'' In one panel, dozens of Seattle icons _ Boeing jets, the 
Space Needle, the Kingdome, skyscrapers, fish, trees _ fit snugly 
inside the mountain. In the next, the mountain explodes, blasting 
everything skyward. Whipple finished his work two days before Rainier's 
downstate neighbor, Mount St. Helen's, began rumblings leading to 
a full-scale eruption.
