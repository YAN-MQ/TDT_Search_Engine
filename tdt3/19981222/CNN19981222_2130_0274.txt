Investigators believe a space heater may have sparked a fire that 
swept through a 12-story apartment building in Detroit today. Firefighters 
used 100-foot ladders to rescue about a dozen people. At least five 
people were treated for smoke inhalation. The red cross is helping 
find temporary Shelter for about 170 people whose apartments were 
damaged.
