It was a good night to feel sorry for Bill Clinton. The impeached 
president was throwing a big Christmas party for his tormentors in 
the press. It seemed too much to ask, after the December he has endured, 
that he should have to entertain the people who have brought to the 
world's attention all his flaws and felonious behavior. A White House 
party in this season of peace, good will and impeachment seemed too 
strange to miss. On Sunday The Times printed the recollections of 
Mark Twain, who went, as a 32-year-old journalist, to a reception 
at Andrew Johnson's White House on the eve of that president's impeachment. 
``I confess I went out of a thoughtless curiosity to see how the Chief 
Magistrate bore himself under these untoward circumstances,'' Twain 
wrote. ``I never saw a man who seemed as friendless and forsaken.'' 
Still thoughtlessly curious 130 years later, 6,000 journalists piled 
into a long line at the White House gate on Monday night. Once in 
a while a clown _ I mean, a real clown _ pranced by. Waiting, I mused 
how odd it was that a president who seemed so cuddly and eager to 
please had ended up creating so much chaos. There is something about 
him _ maybe the feeling that he's always getting away with something 
_ that drives people crazy. In Washington, we refer to this polarizing 
effect as ``Clinton poisoning.'' He drove Ken Starr crazy. He drove 
the Republicans crazy. He drove pundits crazy. He drove his staff 
crazy. He drove the country crazy; even if you don't want Clinton 
impeached, it doesn't make sense for him to have such celestial approval 
ratings. Once inside, we were greeted by the saturnine portrait of 
Andrew Johnson, and two rooms down there was Andrew Jackson, the only 
president to be censured. After another hour of standing in line to 
stand in another line, we finally reached a huddled mass of humanity 
waiting on the South Lawn to jam itself into an overheated tent. Inside 
there were only more clowns and wilted cookies. I waited in still 
another line, trying to snag an eggnog while a singer on stage warbled 
badly about putting on ``your bright red jammies.'' I couldn't help 
but dream of the giant buffet tables of White House Christmases past, 
those platters heaped with shrimp and succulent lamb chops, and agree 
with my friends that this party was the Clintons' revenge on us. Feet 
aching and deprived of sustenance, I thought about all the other things 
that have gone crazy this year. Feminism is ruined. That was clear 
once again when that self-styled feminist iconette, Geraldine Ferraro, 
pitched in to help the president on the impeachment vote by lobbying 
Republican women in the House. Calling Tillie Fowler of Florida, Ms. 
Ferraro made her pitch: ``Tillie, a man is a man is a man.'' And when 
the matriarch of feminism, Betty Friedan, lobbied for the president 
by saying, ``Even if he did what he is alleged to have done, what's 
the big deal?'' Journalism is ruined. Now Larry Flynt, Matt Drudge 
and Salon are running the show, dishing the dirt, while the rest of 
us try to figure out where that slippery little line between private 
and public is. Sex scandals are ruined. Like ``The Blue Room,'' the 
Oval Office was all about sex without being sexy. If only David Hare 
could be impeached, and Bill Clinton could get bad reviews. Socializing 
is ruined. Nobody can go to dinner here anymore without getting into 
a screaming match over Bill Clinton's sex life. Contrition is ruined. 
The Clinton confessions lose in authenticity as they gain in frequency. 
The only thing he's really sorry about is that he got caught. And 
then, the minute things start to go well for him, he becomes overconfident 
and slips up. At a White House party for supporters on Sunday, he 
once again compared himself to Nelson Mandela, telling an L.A. Times 
reporter that the South African hero had advised him not to give his 
heart and mind to his adversaries. If he means that he should not 
become vindictive, then the lesson is the right one. If he means that 
he can paint himself as a political martyr, then here we go again. 
I fled the stuffy tent without laying eyes on the president to see 
if he looked ``friendless and forsaken.'' But I still felt sorry for 
the guy. He must drive himself crazy too. (BOX)
