A Red Cross delegate who has just spent more than a year in Afghanistan 
says economic hardship, there, has increased since international aid 
agencies withdrew, last August, because of safety concerns. The official 
made his remarks in Geneva, Tuesday. Lisa Schlein has the details. 
Red Cross delegate, Juan Martinez,, says the people of Kabul and elsewhere 
in the country, are very concerned about the economic situation. While 
no one is dying of hunger, Mr. Martinez says people are having a very 
tough time right now. He told reporters that many Afghani government 
agencies stopped paying their workers' salaries a long time ago. The 
international committee of the Red Cross is the only agency providing 
humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan since the United Nations and 
private aid agencies pulled out. Most of its operations are centered 
in Kobul. The Red Cross provides food, and other basic assistance, 
to about 200,000 of the most vulnerable people, widows, children, 
the disabled, and elderly. Mr. Martinez says about one dozen private 
aid organizations have returned to Afghanistan, but they've done it 
unofficially. He says these organizations are negotiating with Tolabon 
rulers, the terms under which they will be able to resume their humanitarian 
activities. But, negotiations between the United Nations and the Tolebon, 
he says, have been temporarily suspended. I guess we won't see any 
expatriate from the U.N. before springtime in Kabul, because it's 
not so easy I guess. So, should the U.N. want to come back, the Tolibon's 
are open to that demand. But, I don't think that, for the moment, 
they have found common ground for that. The United Nations says it 
will not return to Afghanistan until the Toliban stop discriminating 
against women and allows its workers to provide health, and other 
assistance, equally to both women and men. Mr. Martinez says, unlike 
the U.N., the Toliban use the Red Cross as a neutral agency. Therefore, 
he says, the Red Cross is able to operate more freely in the country. 
He says the Toliban does not bar the Red Cross from giving women the 
help they need. Lisa Schlein, for VOA News, Geneva.
