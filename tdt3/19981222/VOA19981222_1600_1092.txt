The top U.S. prosecutor in Salt Lake City will not be leading an investigation 
into bribery allegations involving the city's bid for the 2002 Olympics. 
Salt Lake City U.S. Attorney, Paul Warner has removed his office from 
any role in the preliminary investigation. Salt Lake City is being 
probed to find if Olympic organizers provided gifts, medical care, 
and scholarships to buy the votes of IOC members. U.S. Attorney General, 
Janet Reno, says the Justice Department is reviewing the matter to 
see if Federal laws were violated. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
covers bribery of foreign governments.
