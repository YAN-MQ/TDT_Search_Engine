BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British warplanes violated Iraqi airspace 
and fired two ``stray missiles'' Tuesday in the direction of the southern 
Iraqi city of Basra, the official Iraqi News Agency reported The Pentagon 
denied the report, and Britain's Defense Ministry said it was checking 
the account. The report did not define what it meant by ``stray missiles'' 
or say if they had hit anything. The report comes three days after 
the United States and Britain ended four waves of punishing airstrikes 
on Iraq. Western jets patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraq 
have in the past fired if approached by Iraqi aircraft or Iraqi anti-aircraft 
batteries lock on with their radar systems to the Western craft. U.S. 
officials said they had no indication of Western forces firing missiles 
in the region Tuesday. U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander 
of U.S. forces in the Middle East, who was preparing to leave Andrews 
Air Force Base to visit troops in the Middle East, said: ``We have 
no reports of any of our aircraft involved in missile firings.'' He 
said at the Maryland air base that his comment also was referring 
to British forces. Zinni said flights are continuing, however. The 
news agency, quoting an authoritative military spokesman, said aircraft 
from the ``criminal aggressors'' _ used to mean the United States 
and Britain _ came in two waves and the second wave opened fire. It 
said ``four formations of aircraft ... penetrated Iraq's national 
airspace'' at 9:15 a.m. (0630 GMT), then returned in the direction 
from which they had come. The agency said five more formations entered 
Iraq at 2:17 p.m. (1117 GMT) ``and approached northern Basra out of 
range of our weapons and fired two stray missiles before fleeing.'' 
``This violation is part of the policy to harm Iraq,'' the agency 
added. The reported incident came as the United States and Iraq continued 
to trade rhetoric over the U.S.-British airstrikes of last week. While 
Washington characterized the four-day offensive as a success, Iraq's 
state-run newspapers declared Tuesday that President Saddam Hussein's 
continued hold on power showed Iraq had emerged victorious from the 
onslaught. ``The enemies made a bid that a riot would take place in 
the country, but they were wrong because Iraqis are closer to their 
leader now than ever,'' the weekly Al-Ittihad said in an editorial. 
The view was echoed in other government newspapers, which also claimed 
the four-day attack had built sympathy for Iraq among the world's 
Muslims. About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated during last 
week's airstrikes headed back to Baghdad from neighboring Jordan on 
Tuesday morning, and a U.N. official said they would be back at work 
Wednesday. Khalid al-Izzi, an aide to U.N. humanitarian coordinator 
Hans von Sponeck, said the first job would be to assess damage from 
the airstrikes. On Monday night, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz 
gave the first official casualty figures for soldiers in the bombardment, 
saying 62 were killed and 180 wounded. He repeated assertions that 
many more civilians were killed, but refused to give figures. Iraqi 
authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites where they 
reported heavy civilian casualties as they have in the past _ an indication 
the casualties either were not high or were scattered. The attacks 
targeted key military bases, government buildings, communication centers 
and military factories. U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the airstrikes 
after chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq of 
failing to fully cooperate with his inspectors. The weapons inspectors 
must certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction before 
the U.N. Security Council will lift economic sanctions imposed on 
Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Aziz and other officials 
said the attacks disrupted telephone communications to Iraq's south 
and heavily damaged factories that could be used to manufacture long-range 
missiles prohibited under the U.N. resolutions. In Washington, Zinni 
said the strikes hit 85 percent of their targets, 74 percent of them 
successfully. He said a full damage assessment of damage would probably 
take a few more days. Zinni showed pictures of damage to Iraq's Defense 
Ministry in Baghdad and the headquarters of the ruling Baath Party. 
``I guarantee you, nobody's working in the Baath Party headquarters,'' 
he joked, pointing to the scarred building. U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who was with Zinni as he briefed reporters, termed 
Operation Desert Fox ``highly successful.'' In London, British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair said the airstrikes have set back parts of Iraq's 
``military infrastructure several years.'' Aziz maintained, however, 
that most of the strikes hit empty barracks, adding that ``these barracks 
could be and will be rebuilt.'' A U.S. intelligence report revealed 
by ABC News said that most critical equipment from inside the missile 
plants had been moved and Iraqi technicians responsible for building 
missiles were at home in bed _ and not at the plants _ during the 
attacks. Iraq said that in addition to hitting missile factories, 
the bombardments struck colleges, post offices, dormitories, a museum 
and an oil refinery. ``They want to ... strip Iraq of any serious 
industrial capabilities,'' Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad. 
But he contended that the United States and Britain failed to seriously 
harm the Iraqi government or military. ``They boasted of great success. 
... They lied,'' he said. Aziz reiterated Monday that Baghdad will 
not allow U.N. arms monitors to return, but chief weapons inspector 
Butler said it was up to the Security Council to decide the future 
of the inspectors. ``It's not for Baghdad alone to make that declaration,'' 
Butler told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Tuesday.
