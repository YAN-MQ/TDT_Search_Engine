Germany will take part in next year's Confederations' Cup in Mexico 
following the withdrawal of World Cup champions France, FIFA said 
Tuesday. The tournament will take place July 24 to Aug. 4 _ four days 
earlier than planned _ to accommodate the new team, soccer's governing 
body said. France pulled out because of clashes with its domestic 
and European schedules.
