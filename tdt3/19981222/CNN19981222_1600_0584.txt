Iceland's largest sub-Glacier volcano is still shooting ashes and 
flames thousands of feet into the air, five days after it erupted. 
And experts say it could go on for days longer. When the Glacier last 
erupted two years ago, it caused a huge glacial Dam to burst, flooding 
rivers and damaging roads and bridges. This time, authorities say, 
there may be some overflow, but they note, heavy flooding is unlikely 
because of low water levels.
