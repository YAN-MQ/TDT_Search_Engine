A balloon team hoping to be the first to circle the globe non-stop 
has cleared a major hurdle in China. Chinese leaders have rescinded 
an order demanding the three adventurers land in rugged Himalayan 
terrain without crossing China. They now say the balloon can proceed, 
as long as it leaves prohibited chinese airspace as soon as possible. 
The record-seeking journey could last up to three weeks.
