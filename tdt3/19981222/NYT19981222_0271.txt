For those who just can't wait for Larry Flynt to expose the sex lives 
of some more GOP ``big fish'' in the next Hustler, there's a titillating 
tidbit in the ``Men of the Year'' issue of Time. In an interview, 
Lucianne Goldberg laughingly recalls a tell-all book proposal from 
the ancient, pre-Monica past in which a ``very famous Republican name'' 
would not take off his glasses ``even when he was buck naked, performing 
a particular sex act ... '' Time deletes the Republican name Ms. Goldberg 
merrily provided, but surely someone will pass her dish on to the 
rest of us soon enough. In the few days since Bob Livingston's resignation, 
not even Yuletide good will can slow the sludge. On the right, CNBC's 
``Hardball'' trumpets secret congressional documents ``accusing the 
president of actual forcible rape.'' On the left, Salon magazine uncovers 
still more sleaze from Dan Burton, the congressman who has previously 
admitted to fathering a child out of wedlock. And don't expect an 
end once Bill Clinton leaves office. ``After this thing is over,'' 
Ms. Goldberg tells Time, ``we'll move on to the next thing. There's 
always more to come. Especially now that I know how.'' If there's 
a moral distinction between Ms. Goldberg, a fierce partisan on the 
racy fringe of the publishing world, and Flynt, a fierce partisan 
on the racy fringe of the publishing world, it's visible only to William 
Bennett, who actually told Larry King on Monday that he knew of no 
conservative counterpart to the ``Democrats and liberals'' prying 
into private lives. Bennett apparently hasn't heard either of Ms. 
Goldberg, who urged Linda Tripp to tape Monica Lewinsky and then sped 
the results to Newsweek, or of Richard Mellon Scaife, who funneled 
some $2 million to The American Spectator, which hired private detectives 
to dig up dirt on the president. Flynt so far has offered only up 
to $1 million to smoke out hanky-panky, though he seems to be getting 
more bangs for his buck in the capital than Scaife did even in Clinton's 
all-too-fertile Arkansas. Partisans can and perhaps will argue forever 
whether the left or the right has the grosser slime machine. (Lucy 
or Larry _ now there's the choice from hell.) But it's certain that 
the greater casualties will be on the right, since it's the right 
that has ratcheted up sexual misbehavior as a bar to public office. 
It was Bennett who in February declared: ``Notice to Republican candidates: 
If you committed adultery, I don't think you are going to get the 
nomination.'' It was Jerry Falwell who announced after the revelation 
of Livingston's affairs (but before his resignation) that he ``should 
have withdrawn himself'' when initially offered the job. It was congressmen 
like Zach Wamp, Steve Largent and Don Manzullo _ favorites of the 
Christian Coalition all _ who warned Livingston on impeachment eve 
that his ``indiscretions'' could cost him right-wing GOP votes essential 
to elect him speaker in January. By never promising us Boy Scouts 
in the Rose Garden or Rotunda, the Democrats have little to lose in 
this ugly game. If what we know about Bill Clinton's sex life by now 
hasn't leveled him, what further revelation could? The Republicans, 
meanwhile, have handed Larry Flynt the ammunition to mow them down. 
The only way disarmament will come is if the GOP now takes that ammunition 
away _ if someone within the Republican Party has the guts to stand 
up to its powerful religious wing and say that private sexual behavior 
(whether that of a heterosexual congressman or a gay ambassadorial 
nominee) is really, truly not a criterion for public office. Bob Livingston 
could have been just the heroic Joseph Welch required, but by inaccurately 
likening his plight to the president's and then resigning, he botched 
his historic opportunity and handed the culture warriors of his party 
the very victory they crave. Unlike Clinton, who was supposedly impeached 
for the illegal act of perjury, not sex, the fallen speaker-to-be 
resigned for sex alone, not perjury _ thereby ratifying the religious 
right's position that sex in itself can drum a sinner out of public 
office. Far from inspiring the presidential resignation he intended, 
Livingston has in one disastrous act empowered both his own party's 
zealots and Flynt. Our ``Crucible'' may have only just begun.
