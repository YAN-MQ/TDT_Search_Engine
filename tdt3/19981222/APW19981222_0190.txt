A militant Islamic group has denied reports that it threatened to 
bomb U.S. and Kuwaiti interests to avenge the American and British 
airstrikes on Iraq, a leading Arab newspaper reported Tuesday. The 
London-based Al-Hayat quoted sources close to al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, 
or the Islamic Group, as denying that its members contacted news organizations 
to threaten attacks. It was not immediately clear if the denial reflected 
a split in the leadership of the Islamic Group. In recent months, 
Egyptian leaders of the group have called for an end to violent activities 
here, but militants abroad have said the struggle should continue 
against the Egyptian government. Al-Hayat reported Monday that it 
had received a statement and a phone call from people claiming to 
represent the Islamic Group. They urged a ``holy war'' against the 
United States and threatened to blow up Kuwaiti embassies. In the 
denial published Tuesday, the paper quoted an Islamic Group source 
as saying: ``The group does not announce in advance the operations 
it plans to carry out, in order to protect its credibility and members.'' 
The source was not identified, but the article carried a Cairo dateline. 
The United States and Britain last week carried out four days of punishing 
airstrikes against Iraq after the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard 
Butler, said the Baghdad regime was not cooperating in the inspectors' 
search for weapons of mass destruction. The attack lead to widespread 
protests around the Arab world. The Islamic Group carried out a six-year 
campaign of violence aimed at toppling Egypt's secular government 
that led to more than 1,250 deaths. The group wants to install an 
Islamic regime.
