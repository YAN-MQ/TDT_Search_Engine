I'm Steve Ember. Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are 
about to take a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Well, let's 
take a look at some Wednesday weather forecast for our listeners and 
friends in the Middle East. On Wednesday, it will be a sunny, warm 
31 degrees in Abu Dawhah. Amman, Jordan, 16 and sunny. In Baghdad, 
a sunny and pleasant 22 degrees for your Wednesday high. Beirut, Lebanon, 
17 degrees, although you can expect showers. Meanwhile it will be 
sunny and breezy and 20 degrees at Cairo, Egypt. Damascus, 16 degrees 
and mostly sunny. In Jerusalem, 14. Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, your Wednesday 
high, 32 degrees. Kuwait City, 28 and mostly sunny. Riyadh, Saudi 
Arabia, 27 on Wednesday. And in Tabriz, Iran, 7 degrees. We're coming 
up on 22 hours universal time, meaning we are closing down all frequencies 
to the Middle East, North Africa and Europe, except for 1548 kilohertz 
medium wave to the Persian Gulf region. In Europe, during the next 
hour, VOA News Now can be heard on WRN 1, via astra-channel
