Trainer Tommy Brooks is looking for a return of the old Mike Tyson 
when the former heavyweight champion makes his comeback next month. 
``In order for him to be successful again, to regain the title, we 
have to go back to the old style,'' Brooks said of Tyson (45-3 with 
39 knockouts), who has not fought since being disqualified for biting 
Evander Holyfield's ears in their rematch in June 1997. Tyson was 
banned by boxing for a year before having his license returned by 
the Nevada State Athletic Commission two months ago. ``We are looking 
to get that head movement, nonstop punching and stepping aside and 
around his opponent back,' Brooks said during a conference call on 
Tuesday from Scottsdale, Arizona, where Tyson is training for his 
Jan. 16 fight against South Africa's Francois Botha in Las Vegas. 
Brooks joined Tyson's camp as head trainer seven weeks ago without 
any thought of remaking the man who once was the most feared heavyweight 
in the world. ``When you are a new trainer, what I've been concentrating 
on is not trying to change his style but working to get back to the 
Mike Tyson of old,'' Brooks said. ``I was worried that I might not 
have enough time, but he showed me he was taking everything in that 
we were working on. He was putting his punches together in bunches 
and not trying to take him out in one punch. He was not squaring up.'' 
Brooks was in Holyfield's corner for his two victories over Tyson. 
In the rematch, Brooks remembers sensing Tyson's growing frustration 
before snapping and biting Holyfield's ear to get disqualified in 
the third round. ``The thing that happened to Mike was he wasn't in 
shape and he was getting hit by punches that he didn't think he could 
get hit by and he just lost it,'' Brooks said. ``He was going back 
to his corner and not getting any help. He lost his confidence in 
his corner. They weren't telling him anything. He had no program. 
That won't happen this time. ``We've have been doing our homework 
on this guy,'' Brooks said of Botha (39-1, with 24 KOs). ``We are 
going to capitalize on what we can do best and just going to take 
it to him.''
