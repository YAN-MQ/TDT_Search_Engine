The Republican leaders of the State Senate say they intend to push 
a far-reaching plan through the legislature that would, for the first 
time, provide a tax deduction for the payment of college tuition. 
The proposal, one of the few of its kind in the nation, would allow 
all New York taxpayers who live or work in the state to deduct the 
full annual cost of college tuition from their taxable state income, 
regardless of how much they earn. The deduction would apply to the 
payment of tuition at any accredited college or university, or professional 
or trade school, in the United States or abroad. But it would not 
cover money spent on books, room and board, and other educational 
fees. Under the proposal, for example, a family of four with a gross 
income of $55,000 a year and paying the average tuition of $12,000 
a year at a private college would reduce their taxable state income 
to $43,000, assuming there were no other deductions. That, in turn, 
would reduce their annual state tax bill to $1,289 from $1,769, a 
saving of $480. That same family, paying the $3,400 tuition at one 
of the public state colleges, would reduce their tax bill by $136 
a year. The plan, estimated to cost the state $275 million in unpaid 
taxes by the 2002-03 fiscal year, represents the opening bid in what 
is likely to be a contentious debate over how the state should use 
its 1999 budget surplus, which is estimated to be as much as $2 billion. 
Democrats in the Legislature have already begun staking their claims 
on the surplus, suggesting that the money be spent on repairing or 
replacing many of the state's dilapidated schools, among other things. 
But Republicans in the Senate say they are convinced that their proposal 
will have such broad appeal to the middle class that their Democratic 
rivals will find it politically difficult to resist. ``What is most 
troubling to the middle class?'' Joseph L. Bruno, the leader of the 
Republican majority in the Senate, asked in an interview on Tuesday. 
``It's educating their children and getting them a college education. 
This would help middle-income families struggling with the costs of 
college.'' The proposal to provide tax deductions to offset the cost 
of college comes just two months after the state initiated another 
program intended to make college more affordable. Under that program, 
individuals can deduct thousands of dollars from their state taxable 
income by putting the money in a special savings account to pay for 
college. Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon 
Silver, said on Tuesday that Democrats were considering their own 
tax cuts, aimed primarily at spurring job growth. But she added that 
the Assembly leadership would be open to considering the college plan. 
``Obviously, it's something that we would be interested in,'' she 
said. The college plan is the centerpiece of a broad package of tax 
cuts that Senate Republicans say they intend to push during the 1999 
legislative session, which begins next month. Bruno's aides said that 
he intended to release details of the Republicans' package at a news 
conference on Wednesday in Albany. Five other states _ New Jersey, 
Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan, and Arkansas _ already allow taxpayers 
to deduct a portion of their annual college tuition costs. But the 
proposal in New York differs from the other plans in that it would 
allow people to deduct the total cost of their annual college tuition.
