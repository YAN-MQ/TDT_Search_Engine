Princess Diana's former butler has lost his job at the charity set 
up in her memory. Paul Burrell, 40, the man whom the late princess 
called ``my rock,'' cleared out his desk Tuesday and said his goodbyes. 
Burrell had been the chief fundraiser of the Diana, Princess of Wales 
Memorial Fund, but was told that since the charity no longer was actively 
raising money, the position wasn't necessary. The fund's chief executive, 
Andrew Purkis, said he had offered Burrell a new job as a roving ambassador 
for the charity, but that he had refused. Burrell spent the morning 
packing up boxes from his office, then left the building saying only, 
``I am very sad.'' Looking tearful, he hugged another fund employee, 
Jacqueline Allen. ``I think the general public know how much Paul 
has given to the fund,'' she said later. ``I just think it is tragic 
that he is no longer with it.'' The charity, which provides money 
for causes sponsored by the late princess, will concentrate on managing 
its existing funds.
