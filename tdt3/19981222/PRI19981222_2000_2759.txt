Ah, he's not the only one who's going to be home for Christmas. It 
will also be a homecoming for King Simeon II who, after more than 
50 years, is returning home for the holidays. He and his family fled 
this Balkan state that's the topic of our geo quiz today when he was 
9 years old after a Communist regime took power. The answer to our

restore the monarchy or King Simeon who lives and works now as a consultant 
in Madrid.
