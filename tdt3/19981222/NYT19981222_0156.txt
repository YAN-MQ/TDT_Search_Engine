On the menu it hardly seemed a dish of note: a spot of cheese, some 
dried fruits and roasted almonds. But this combination led three friends 
and me to wax rhapsodic as we each took a bite of the most famous 
of all Portuguese cheeses, queijo de Serra, with a bit of fig drizzled 
with balsamic vinegar. Could it possibly have tasted so luscious? 
We each took another bite, then another and another, trying the cheese 
with some dates, then with almonds, and then, in complete abandon, 
with everything in one mouthful, on a bit of crisped bread. The buttery 
sheep's-milk cheese, with the texture of a runny reblochon but much 
milder, wraps each piece of fruit in its sweetness. But it is the 
20-year-old balsamic vinegar, syrupy and sweetly sharp, that makes 
the dish something that is more than the sum of its parts _ while 
allowing the taste and texture of each element to shine through. The 
revelations took place at O Padeiro, a Portuguese bakery in Chelsea 
that started serving food in June. While you would not find a similar 
pairing of fruit and cheese in Portugal, dried fruits and almonds 
are an important part of Portuguese cooking. How typically American 
to meld different culinary cultures, creating something even better 
than the original. The plate, which can be eaten by one hungry person 
or shared by four, is $12.
