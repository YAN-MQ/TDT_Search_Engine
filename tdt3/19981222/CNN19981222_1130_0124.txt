President Clinton is going about daily duties, while his lawyers try 
to stave off a Senate trial with legal wranglings about its constitutionality. 
Wolf Blitzer reports, Mr. Clinton still hopes for a censure resolution. 
A few days to celebrate the season -- President Clinton, volunteer 
in chief at a soup kitchen, anxious to remain above the impeachment 
battle, was asked if he has anything to say to Congress. I hope they 
and everyone will take some time to think about other people and do 
something in the spirit of the season -- something like this. His 
defenders, though, are sending out a dual-pronged message. First, 
the olive branch from vice President Al Gore, who's expected to play 
a more visible role in the president's defense. I do hope that the 
United States Senate will rise to this moment, as it so often does, 
to be the voice of reason, deliberation and healing that america needs. 
Second, the promise of a bitter legal battle if it does come down 
to a Senate trial. The president's lawyers, as you can expect, are 
looking at a whole series of legal and constitutional issues. Their 
hope remains a censure resolution, which is what former presidents 
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter have now proposed. Their plan includes 
-- a public acknowledgement that he did not tell the truth under oath. 
-- Something the president so far has refused to do. Even though Mr. 
Clinton has called for an end to the "politics of personal destruction," 
the White House won't ask either "hustler" magazine publisher larry 
Flynt or even presidential pal James Carville to lay off. Aides say 
they were lulled into complacency after last month's midterm elections. 
They promise that won't happen again. Wolf Blitzer, CNN, the White 
House.
