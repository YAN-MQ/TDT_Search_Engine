For many of our FM and medium-wave listeners, your local stations

This is Tuesday, December 22, 1998. It is the first full day on our... 
Mm-hmm. ... of winter... Winter. Mm-hmm. ... in the northern hemisphere. 
In the northern hemisphere. If you're in Australia of course happy 
summer. yes. Or if you're in Brazil; same thing. On this date in 1963, 
35 years ago today, president Lyndon Johnson led the ceremony ending 
the official one-month national period of mourning for the assassinated 
president John F. Kennedy. The president had been shot and killed 
in Dallas, Texas on November 22. President Johnson spoke from the 
steps of the Lincoln Memorial. He had to contend with chilly, gusty 
winds and the emotions of the day. Yes. About 15,000 people came to 
that ceremony at the structure dedicated to Abraham Lincoln, another 
assassinated president. "Throughout his life," Mr. Johnson said of 
the slain president, "he had malice toward none, but a senseless act 
of mindless malice struck down this man of charity, and we shall never 
be the same." That was a terrible time in the history of this country, 
and I remember it well -- one solid month of mourning... Mm-hmm. ... 
for President Clinton. As President Johnson spoke, the crowd could 
see the flickering eternal flame at the grave of President Kennedy 
at Arlington National Cemetery. President Johnson concluded the ceremony 
when he said, "We buried Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy, but we 
did not bury their dreams and visions." Every morning, I don't know 
about you Curt, but when I go home, I drive right by there and you 
can see the eternal flame. Indeed. A constant reminder of the terrible 
thing that happened on one month ago in 1963 in November. Ten hours 
thirty Universal Time and this is VOA News Now. The Middle East peace 
process is on hold as Israel heads for new elections expected in late 
April. A divided U.N. Security Council resumes closed-door talks in 
New York on how to eliminate Iraq's banned weapons of mass destruction. 
Those stories plus business news all coming up in the next half hour 
of VOA News Now. Hello again. I'm Curt Hetchen along with Paul Westfeeling, 
and this is VOA News Now.
