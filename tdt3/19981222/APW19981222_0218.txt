The Philippines' first death row convict to be scheduled for execution 
in 22 years married his girlfriend in ceremonies inside his cell Tuesday, 
radio reports said. Leo Echegaray has been sentenced to die by lethal 
injection between Jan. 4 and 8 at the suburban National Penitentiary 
for raping the daughter of another girlfriend. Echegaray and Zenaida 
Javier were married by the prison chaplain Roberto Olaguer after the 
Department of Justice gave approval Tuesday afternoon. No reporters 
were allowed to cover the ceremonies, the reports said. ``The couple 
were happy because they were finally married,'' media reports quoted 
one woman, who witnessed the wedding, as saying. Prison officials 
were unavailable for comment. Echegaray is the first among 844 death-row 
inmates to be scheduled for execution. The planned execution has triggered 
a debate among Filipinos over capital punishment. Several countries, 
including the European Union, the Vatican and Canada, have appealed 
to President Joseph Estrada to cancel Echegaray's execution and repeal 
the death penalty. Estrada has refused to pardon Echegaray, saying 
his execution will deter similar crimes. In 1987, a new constitution 
abolished the death penalty but gave Congress the option to restore 
it for ``heinous'' crimes such as murder, ransom kidnapping, rape 
and drug trafficking. Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took 
that option, bringing back the death penalty in 1994. Many Filipinos 
believe that the death penalty will deter crime, and that crime remains 
rampant because no one has been executed. Roman Catholic bishops and 
other civic groups opposed to the death penalty say there is no proof 
of that, and that poor people are more likely to be sentenced to death 
because they cannot afford good lawyers.
