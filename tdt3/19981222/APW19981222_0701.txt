The father of Goran Ivanisevic and the head of the Croatian tennis 
federation have been found guilty of slandering each other, Croatian 
media reported Tuesday. A Zagreb district court on Monday sentenced 
both Srdjan Ivanisevic and Suad Rizvanbegovic to 30 days in prison 
or one year suspended for insulting and slandering the other, Jutarnji 
list daily reported. For more than a year, the elder Ivanisevic and 
Rizvanbegovic have been engaged in a row over the control of Croatian 
tennis. The quarrel caused Goran Ivanisevic to stop playing in the 
Davis Cup for his country, demanding Rizvanbegovic vacate the his 
post in the federation. He even appealed to President Franjo Tudjman 
_ an avid tennis player and fan _ to intervene. But Tudjman instead 
apparently chose to back Rizvanbegovic, who is often seen in his company. 
Following the spat, Srdjan Ivanisevic folded the Croatian Indoors 
tournament he previously operated. Ivanisevic and Rizvanbegovic both 
spoke to the press regarding the quarrel and subsequently sued each 
other for slander. Rizvanbegovic said he was offended by an interview 
Ivanisevic gave to independent Globus weekly in February, in which 
he accused Rizvanbegovic of ``buying'' his position with someone else's 
money and not being a true Croat. Rizvanbegovic, who also is an executive 
in the country's biggest insurance company, said his sentence was 
``inappropriate.'' Ivanisevic, for his part, sued Rizvanbegovic over 
the accusation that Ivanisevic formed a pro-Yugoslav party. Croatia 
declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, triggering a six-month 
war with minority Serbs in the country.
