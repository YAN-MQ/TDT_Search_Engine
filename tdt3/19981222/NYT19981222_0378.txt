David S. Jackson, a member of the American Stock Exchange for 73 years 
and an exchange governor from 1965 to 1968, died Sunday, a son-in-law, 
Andrew Segal, said. Jackson was 96. Jackson, who was born in Manhattan, 
joined the exchange in 1925, working as a specialist. By 1930, when 
he married Freda King, he had made his first million. In 1931, during 
the second wave of the stock market crash, he lost most of his money 
but subsequently recovered. Jackson came into the limelight in 1955 
as a result of a Sunday night broadcast by Walter Winchell during 
which Winchell ``tipped'' Pantepee Oil stock as a recommendation to 
his audience. At the time, Jackson was the specialist in the stock. 
Public reaction was so great that Jackson risked his own finances 
by selling the stock short to meet the surge of demand. In large part 
because of Jackson's selling, the stock did not rise significantly. 
In the following week, it fell, and Jackson made $50,000 after buying 
back shares to cover his short position. Jackson was not shy about 
taking risks or making his views known. In 1969, he was openly critical 
of the exchange's administration and sought the resignation of its 
president, Edward T. McCormick, contending that the exchange had not 
dealt promptly with a specialist who had been enjoined for securities 
violations by the SEC. Jackson was angered that the injunction was 
never formally brought to the attention of the general membership. 
The exchange eventually appointed a special committee that rewrote 
the exchange constitution, and both McCormick and his board resigned. 
Jackson; Ralph Saul, a former SEC commissioner, and the Securities 
and Exchange Commission later rewrote the rules that governed specialists' 
obligations and trading rules. Jackson's other interests were as diverse 
as ballet, fishing, horse racing, bridge and travel in France. He 
retired from active work in 1971, but his firm, Jackson &AMP; Segal, 
continued until 1982. Subsequently, Jackson retained his seat privileges 
on the exchange. Jackson is survived by his wife, Freda, and two daughters, 
Linda Segal of New York and Nancy Godwin of Paris.
