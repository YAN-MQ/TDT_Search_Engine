By all accounts, he's facing an uphill battle: a campaign to unseat 
the incumbent prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a media-savvy politician 
with a talent for selling himself. So opposition leader Ehud Barak 
is fighting back _ with the help of some high-priced American spin 
doctors. Under their tutelage, his campaign debut is marked by a scrappier 
style. When Netanyahu came out swinging, mocking the ``fantasies and 
ambitions'' of his political rivals, Barak jabbed back with ridicule 
of what he calls ``Orwellian Bibi-speak.'' In an interview with The 
Associated Press, Barak indicated the issues in Israel's upcoming 
election would be less about Israeli-Arab relations and more about 
the economy and the character of Netanyahu, known by his nickname 
``Bibi.'' Barak attacked Netanyahu for giving away too much tax money 
to ultra-Orthodox religious parties and Jewish settlers in the West 
Bank. He also accused Netanyahu of trying to please everyone, deriding 
what he called ``Orwellian Bibi-speak in which you can hear whatever 
you want.'' ``If peace could be achieved through the (television) 
screen, and terror could be defeated through spin, then we have an 
ideal prime minister,'' said Barak. Critics accuse Barak of being 
a lackluster Labor Party leader who has adopted a me-too approach 
to the Israel-Palestinian issue in order to win-over the security-minded 
voters of the center-right. Asked if his policies were like Netanyahu's, 
Barak said: ``Oh, come on. Whoever wants an extra quarter-million 
unemployed, please vote Bibi. Whoever wants paralysis and impasses 
please vote Bibi. Whoever wants a government hostage to extremists, 
vote Bibi.'' By ``extremists'' Barak said he meant ultra-Orthodox 
factions and Jewish settlers, who had milked precious resources from 
Netanyahu's government and left school classrooms overcrowded and 
health services strained as a result. ``The way to get rid of this 
kind of leverage is to create a a wide government backed by a big 
enough fraction of the public that will enable us to do it,'' he said. 
``I respect tradition. I respect religious people. I'm against arm-twisting 
in the political arena.'' In the interview, Barak defined himself 
as a ``man of action,'' which is well supported by his resume but 
not obvious from his short stature, paunch and seeming shyness. As 
a paratroop commando in April 1973, he pulled a blond wig over his 
black, curly hair and applied lipstick and mascara. His mission: a 
commando raid in downtown Beirut to assassinate three PLO leaders. 
In May 1972, Barak led a team of 16 commandos, including Netanyahu, 
who disguised themselves as airline technicians and stormed a hijacked 
Sabena plane, killing two Palestinian hijackers and capturing two 
others. To spruce up his image, Barak hired some high-profile American 
experts including James Carville, who helped Bill Clinton get to the 
White House. The result is a more combative, less intellectual challenger 
who says he will win by ``being myself.'' In the latest polls, Barak 
and Netanyahu were nearly even with a strong showing by Amnon Lipkin 
Shahak, a former chief of staff who has yet to announce his candidacy 
but is expected to head a centrist party. In a radio interview Tuesday, 
Netanyahu shrugged off his challengers: ``The fantasies and ambitions 
of all those who want to be prime minister _ please. We will allow 
the voters to decide who needs to lead the state.'' In the AP interview, 
Barak skirted questions about what he would do if Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat declared a state on May 4, 1999, as he has threatened 
to do if there is no final status agreement. Netanyahu, who opposes 
an independent Palestinian state, has vowed to annex West Bank land 
around Jewish settlements and in areas needed for security. Barak 
said it would be a mistake for Arafat to declare a state without negotiating 
security arrangements. But, unlike Netanyahu, the Labor leader said 
he would not quibble about the name. ``It's up to them. I'm not going 
to patronize them,'' he said. ``They have their right to determine 
the name they call themselves as long as they fully comply with the 
mutually agreed terms of security.'' His terms, Barak said, were that 
Israel would not agree to a Palestinian army, a division of Jerusalem 
or a return to the 1967 borders that existed when Israel captured 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War. Jewish settlements, 
which now number more than 140 with 150,000 residents, should be clustered 
into blocs that remain under Israel's control, but he would not demand 
``every isolated settlement.''
