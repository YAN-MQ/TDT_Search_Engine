"CNN Headline News," I'm Judy Fortin. Drivers across the nation don't 
need to look at a calendar to know it's the first full day of winter. 
Ice and snow are making roads hazardous from the pacific coast through 
the midwest, and the blast of Arctic air is expected to reach the 
eastern seaboard by this evening. Bill Hemmer has details. Only about 
an inch of snow fell in parts of Washington state, but it was enough 
to catch some drivers off guard. Dozens of accidents were reported 
along interstate 5. among them, a pileup involving 20 to 30 vehicles 
near Woodland, closing the interstate for two hours. No one, though, 
was seriously hurt. Citrus growers in southern California keeping 
a wary eye on the falling mercury. Freeze warnings have been posted 
in Ventura, Los Angeles and Riverside counties. Many growers are using 
wind machines to keep air circulating to prevent their fruit from 
freezing. Some of the worst road conditions have been reported in 
parts of Missouri, kansas and Oklahoma. At least 25 people have been 
killed in traffic accidents. Further south in Texas, temperatures 
dipped down from the 60s to the teens in just a matter of hours. But 
there was one area of the country welcoming that snow and cold -- 
ski resorts in the state of Colorado. We got this snow storm really 
sort of in the Nick of time, because christmas is such a busy time. 
Some resorts reported as much as ten inches of fresh powder. In Denver, 
driving was slow going due to icy road conditions. Temperatures hovered 
in the teens. Bill Hemmer, "Headline News."
