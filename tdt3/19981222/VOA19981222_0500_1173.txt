The coach of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, Dan Reeves, returned to the 
hospital on Sunday, three days after being released following quadruple 
heart bypass surgery. A hospital administrator says that he was not 
feeling well. Reeves is in stable condition and is expected to undergo 
some tests and adjustments of his medication. Acting head coach Rich 
Brooks says Reeves will not be involved in the Falcons' preparations 
for the season finale against Miami. The primary focus for the Reeves' 
family right now is his regaining strength so he can continue the 
rehab process. And that means he will have no involvement in the upcoming 
game against Miami. And we don't know what the return schedule will 
be for him. Reeves watched his Atlanta Falcons on television Sunday 
as they clinched their first divisional title in 18 years with a 24-17 
victory at Detroit. Reeves is hoping to be back to coach in the playoffs.
