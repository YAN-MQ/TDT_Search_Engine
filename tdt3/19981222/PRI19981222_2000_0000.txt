From Public Radio International, this is THE WORLD, a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. Today is Tuesday, 
December 22nd. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Coming up on THE WORLD, 
Israel's Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu comes out swinging in a 
rough-and-tumble reelection campaign, Washington reassesses its China 
policy after Beijing's anti-democracy crackdown, and Russian Jews 
blame the Communist Party for a wave of anti-Semitism. The fact that 
some people are saying nasty things is not a big deal, but when the 
largest political party is going to protect them openly, that's creates 
a real problem. First, this news. For THE WORLD, I'm Derrick Stoffel 
in the BBC Newsroom in London.
