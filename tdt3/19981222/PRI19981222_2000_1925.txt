Scientists at NASA have succeeded in reestablishing communications 
with the first spacecraft to ever be sent into space to study an asteroid. 
THE WORLD's David Lavali has more. For 27 nerve-racking hours, all 
the scientists at NASA heard was silence, and the NEAR Mission, which 
stands for Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, was in jeopardy. But mission 
controllers have now managed to reestablish radio communications. 
Much relieved NASA scientists are now looking forward to seeing pictures 
and getting data from an asteroid that's 200 million miles away. It's 
hoped the research will make it possible to better predict the risk 
of asteroids colliding with our planet and to answer some basic questions 
about the formation of our solar system. For THE WORLD, I'm David 
Lavali.
