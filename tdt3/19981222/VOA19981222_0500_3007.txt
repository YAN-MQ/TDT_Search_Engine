U.S. stocks continue making gains. The widely watched Dow Jones Industrials 
Average resumes trading at just under 9,000 after an 85-point gain 
Monday. Dodge Jorlin, chief technical analyst at Landor Investment 
Management was asked how outside events, including President Clinton's 
impeachment and a pending central bank decision on lowering interest 
rates, are affecting investor decisions. The market recognizes the 
potential impact of all the items that are outstanding, feels that 
they will be resolved favorably but not considerably favorably, and 
has already discounted a lot of the potential outcomes -- obviously, 
the most probable ones -- and is looking forward to the end of the 
year. We are in a very seasonally. So the market is very constructive. 
vvv Mr. Jorlin expects market volatility, but says the trend is higher 
with the potential to the upside not the downside.
