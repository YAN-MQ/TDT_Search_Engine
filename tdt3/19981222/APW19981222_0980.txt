The chief of Iran's hard-line judiciary has ordered the formation 
of a committee to investigate a spate of mysterious deaths of dissidents, 
Tehran newspapers reported Tuesday. The official, Ayatollah Mohammad 
Yazdi, said the special committee would improve coordination of information 
and evidence in the cases, the Farsi-language Iran and other newspapers 
reported. No other details were available. A similar special investigative 
committee has already been set up by moderate President Mohammad Khatami, 
and it was not immediately clear if the one ordered by Yazdi would 
work independently or support the other one. Five dissidents have 
died in the past month, all of them critical of the government's hard-line 
clergymen who are trying to stymie the social and political reforms 
of Khatami. Two more political activists remain missing. Thousands 
of students and intellectuals demonstrated last week to protest the 
killings and called for the dismissal of Yazdi and other intelligence 
officials. There is, however, no evidence linking the hard-liners 
with the killings, and the conservative faction has suggested that 
unnamed foreign forces and even an opposition group in exile could 
be killing dissidents to discredit the government.
