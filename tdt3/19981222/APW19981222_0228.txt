Peace on earth, good will toward men. But not toward pigeons, say 
officials in an Amsterdam neighborhood that has declared war on the 
``flying rats.'' In a bid to rid itself of a plague of pooping pigeons, 
the Bos en Lommer municipality has outlawed feeding the birds and 
will fine anyone caught breaking the new edict. The inner-city municipality 
will slap a 150-guilder (dlrs 83) fine on anyone caught feeding the 
birds and a 250-guilder (dlrs 139) fine on serial cereal distributors 
_ those caught more than once. The measure is the latest in a series 
of measures aimed at tackling the plague of pigeons in the Dutch capital. 
Earlier anti-pigeon plans have included poisoning their food and sowing 
it with anti-conception drugs. Neither has had a noticeable effect. 
``We are getting more and more reports'' of pigeon problems, a city 
official told the Dutch daily De Volkskrant for Tuesday's edition. 
The official, identified only as G. Otten, calls the pigeons ``flying 
rats.'' ``Rats carry annoying diseases and that is sometimes the case 
with pigeons too.''
