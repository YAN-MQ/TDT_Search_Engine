The parents of the McCaughey Septuplets wished the Texas parents of 
octuplets merry Christmas today. All eight of the babies are in critical, 
but stable condition. Charles Zewe has more from Houston. At the neonatal 
intensive care unit of a Houston hospital, doctors say six newborn 
girls and two boys are struggling to live. They are all coming along. 
And they're still on oxygen, they are still on ventilators. Their 
weights range from 11 ounces to almost two pounds. The mother, 27-year-old 
nkem chukwu, is in stable condition. She delivered her first daughter 
December 8th, 12 weeks premature. That infant is now off a ventilator. 
It's is on feedings now, working up to full feedings and is off the 
ventilator and on a small amount of supplemental oxygen but doing 
very nicely. The other babies still have that rocky first week to 
two weeks in front of them. Lung infections and heart problems are 
the chief concern. Mrs. chukwu, a Nigerian native, who resides in 
Houston with her husband, had been taking fertility drugs when she 
conceived. After delivering the first daughter vaginally, doctors 
postponed further labor until Sunday when they decided the littlest 
of the seven remaining fetuses might not survive in the womb, and 
they delivered the remaining children by a caesarian section. One 
of the babies on ultrasound was significantly smaller and had a Reduction 
in the blood flow in the cord, in the umbilical cord. And we were 
concerned that this baby may not survive if were left in utero for 
much longer. So when she went into active labor at that point, and 
she was on multiple medications to stop the labor, nature intervened 
and bailed us out, essentially. The mother was offered the opportunity 
to reduce the number of fetuses to increase their chances of survival, 
but she refused. Doctors say, there's an 85% chance all of the infants 
will live. Charles Zewe, CNN, Houston.
