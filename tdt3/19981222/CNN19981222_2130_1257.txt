Rob Ticktin krrt "Headline Sports." Roger Clemens will play the 199 
season for the blue Jays. That's right the 36-year-old rocket withdrew 
his trade offer and says he will report for spring training. He won 
the cy young award five times. The marketplace is what it is. That 
isn't the driving force behind any of this. For people to characterize 
that is very misleading. I will go out there and win as many times 
as I can do. If something else comes up where they think they can 
improve their team down the road, we will talk again.
