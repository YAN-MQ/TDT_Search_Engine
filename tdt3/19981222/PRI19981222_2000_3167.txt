You may not have heard of Jaojoby, but on his African island nation 
of Madagascar, he and his road shows sell out every place they play. 
THE WORLD'S Marco Worman introduces us to the voice that makes them 
dance on the great red island. In 1970, when he was 15, Jaojoby Usaid 
entered Madagascar's equivalent of "Star Search" and won the top prize. 
From that point on, Jaojoby, as Malagasies know him, had his future 
mapped out. In the same way that Bruce Springsteen puts working-class 
concerns to a driving rock beat, Jaojoby takes similar issues and 
lashes them to Salegy, the national dance beat of Madagascar. In this 
track, Jaojoby lures in the listeners with the description of a sexy 
woman, who, in his words, has a beautiful derriere and thighs that 
make you drool. Think carefully, Jaojoby warns, because AIDS doesn't 
let go of its prey. And while songs for the working class are what 
sets Jaojoby apart from his fellow Malagasy musicians, his currency 
is familiar to all Malagasies, the Salegy. They call the tempo six-eight, 
but me, you know, I say that traditional music that we have electrified. 
If we played a cappella, we would play like our ancestors. The Salegy, 
Jaojoby says, is strongly identified with the accordion, which, while 
native to Madagascar, has been around for centuries. Since the 17th 
century, accordion, you know, came to Madagascar, and in my country, 
it is considered like a traditional music instrument. Yeah. So when 
we play accordion, we just try to play Malagasy traditional music. 
They must really love you on Madagascar. You must be a big hero there. 
Yeah, yeah. You know, to say it myself, you know, may seem to be so 
proud, but in my Madagascar, I know my band is loved, yeah. And the 
crowds especially love the number "Mbola Velono." Jaojoby ends his 
shows with the song and its feverish message about dance. But the 
homegrown rhythm of Salegy still makes Madagascar move. For THE WORLD, 
I'm Marco Worman. And we end our show with Jaojoby's "Mbola Velono." 
I'm Lisa Mullins inviting you to join us again tomorrow for another 
spin of THE WORLD.
