For the online shopper at Amazon.com, it all looks so easy this holiday 
season. ``Easy for the customer, sure,'' said Todd Bradley, a 27-year-old 
cart runner threading through the maze of shelves at the company's 
vast distribution center here. ``You just kick back at home and wait.'' 
Cedric Ross, 29, the training manager, added: ``There's nothing virtual 
about it for us. We've got books to get out the door here.'' The Seattle-based 
company has transformed the world of Internet commerce, offering millions 
of book and compact-disk titles at discount prices and generally tax-free, 
all just one click of a computer mouse away. With 4.5 million customers 
in 160 countries, and with orders coming in around the clock at the 
rate of more than $20 a second, the three-year-old company and its 
34-year-old founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, are already a marketing legend. 
At the end of the day, though _ or at 5 a.m., which is when Bezos 
and many of the company's other top executives have shown up recently 
to help at the distribution warehouse, bleary-eyed and all but oblivious 
to outside events like the impeachment crisis engulfing the White 
House _ somebody has to put books in boxes. The orders course through 
the electronic ether, but on the other end of the transaction a human 
being still needs to fill them. For all the attention paid to the 
remarkable technology and sophisticated software involved in electronic 
commerce, a glimpse at this company in action during the frantic pre-Christmas 
rush suggests that an online store like Amazon.com still needs plenty 
of old-fashioned elbow grease to compete in the virtual marketplace. 
Here, amid stacks and shelves and hundreds of old wooden library carts, 
the company is engaged in an all-hands alert to fill holiday orders 
on time. While much of the 1,600-employee business is computerized, 
a worker still has to walk to a shelf and retrieve a book. And the 
stock itself is arranged in a numbering system that would drive an 
old Dewey-decimal librarian crazy. One case here in the warehouse 
holds copies of ``Taxes for Dummies,'' ``The Tao of Sex,'' Webster's 
Collegiate Dictionary, the ``Goosebumps'' children's book series and 
Immanuel Kant's ``Critique of Pure Reason.'' Normally the orders that 
come in here are handled smoothly by an energetic army of largely 
20-something ``associates,'' who have fast become a literally colorful 
part of company lore. Many dye their hair in hues that range across 
the full spectrum, and adorn an impressive number of pierced body 
parts with jewelry. All have the good fortune to receive stock options 
in Amazon.com in addition to their hourly wages. But in recent weeks 
the company has been so thoroughly deluged with holiday orders that 
it has hired hundreds of temporary workers here and at its other big 
distribution center, in New Castle, Del., and brought executives from 
the downtown Seattle headquarters to the warehouse in an industrial 
neighborhood here. Not that those executives are buttoned-down types 
themselves: at the headquarters, it is far easier to find dogs, which 
are welcome to hang out there with their masters, than neckties, which 
appear to be distinctly frowned upon. In any event, some of the company's 
brainiest talent, people who are usually found designing new Web pages 
or researching other products for potential sales online, can now 
be found taking the merchandise off the shelves one book at a time, 
or pitching in at the loading docks. Although the company has yet 
to actually report a profit, its stock has continued to soar, reaching 
$329 a share today, its highest level ever, before closing at $322.375. 
Some analysts say the price still has far to go. Henry Blodget of 
CIBC Oppenheimer said last week that he expected it to hit $400 within 
a year, and pronounced the company ``in the early stages of building 
a global electronic-retailing franchise that could generate $10 billion 
in revenue and earnings per share of $10 within five years.'' (Sales 
in the most recent quarter were $153.7 million.) But other analysts 
remain skeptical. Jonathan Cohen, a senior analyst at Merrill Lynch 
Global Securities, called the current trading price ``truly outrageous'' 
and said the company should be valued at $50 a share. Like all employees 
of Amazon.com, Bezos _ who so named his company because the image 
of a huge volume of water tracked his goal of dealing in a huge volume 
of books _ refuses to comment on the stock price for the record. Its 
officials say the company is focused solely on developing its customer 
base. ``Underpromise and overdeliver,'' said David Risher, the 32-year-old 
senior vice president and himself a book stocker in recent days. ``It's 
completely what drives us. In this business, the real power is in 
the hands of the customers. They're always one click away from another 
store.'' For anyone who registers as an Amazon.com customer, the company's 
software makes it astoundingly easy _ literally one click of the ``add 
it to your shopping cart'' icon _ to buy a book. But, as Risher puts 
it, ``it takes a lot of work to make it look easy.'' Katherine Koberg 
usually picks books for the company in her position as an editorial 
director for its Web site, deciding which titles to highlight in cyberspace. 
But the other day found her helping out in the warehouse, picking 
books in a very different way _ physically, off the shelves. ``It's 
a collective effort,'' she said, gesturing toward the teams of cart 
runners, gift wrappers and box packers that filled the warehouse. 
``It's a big job. So we just keep doing it.'' By Tuesday, the company 
was all but finished with the Christmas rush. Officials were waiting 
for a flood of last-minute orders for electronic gift certificates, 
but those, at least, require no heavy lifting at all. They are ordered 
online, and automatically sent to the recipient via e-mail. ``And 
they're a procrastinator's dream,'' said Risher, warming to a salesman's 
pitch. ``If it's 11:59 p.m. on Christmas Eve, you can still order, 
and they'll arrive at 12:01 a.m. on Christmas Day.'' Given the millions 
of titles available and the bedlam in the warehouse, a visitor cannot 
help noticing one paradox: no one can actually come here and buy a 
book. This summer, Ross recalled with a laugh, one woman with cash 
in hand managed to slip past the security guards, and she started 
wandering around, looking at the shelves. ``I just didn't know what 
to say to her,'' Ross said. ``I mean, I had no frame of reference 
for what she was asking. So I just had to say: `Lady, you can't buy 
a book in here. The CEO of the company can't buy a book here, unless 
he goes online.' ''
