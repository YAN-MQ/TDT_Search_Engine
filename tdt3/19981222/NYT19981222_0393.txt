J. Harold Flannery Jr., an associate justice of the Massachusetts 
Appeals Court since 1995 who was a civil rights lawyer in the South 
and in Boston in the 1960s and 1970s, died on Friday at Massachusetts 
General Hospital in Boston. He was 65 and lived in Weston, Mass. The 
cause was complications from cancer, said Rudolph Kass, also an associate 
justice of the court. Flannery was a trial lawyer in the civil rights 
division of the Justice Department from 1958 to 1970. He was deputy 
and acting director of the Center for Law and Education at Harvard 
University from 1970 to 1974, national director of the Lawyers' Committee 
for Civil Rights Under Law from 1974 to 1975 and a Massachusetts Superior 
Court judge from 1984 to 1995. In the 1970s, Flannery was the lead 
counsel and strategist for the plaintiffs in Morgan vs. Hennigan, 
the Boston school desegregation case. A federal judge, W. Arthur Garrity 
Jr., ruled in 1974 that the Boston School Committee had long breached 
the 14th Amendment by sending white and black pupils to separate schools 
and withholding from blacks equal protection under the law. Court 
orders were implemented requiring that the Boston school system be 
desegregated by busing. In earlier years, Flannery played a role in 
more than 40 civil rights cases and in other civil-rights matters 
in the South. In 1966, he went to Oxford, Miss., to take part in litigation 
by the federal government to require the authorities in Grenada, Miss., 
to protect journalists and black schoolchildren who had been attacked 
by mobs near that city's newly segregated schools. In 1963, he rushed 
to Danville, Va., to confer with FBI agents at a time when city officials 
were considering a strict curfew to deal with that area's first determined 
effort by blacks to obtain equal rights by demonstration. The effort 
had led to violence and charges of police brutality. While he was 
on the bench, Flannery was perhaps best known for a 1993 case involving 
the right of homosexuals to march in South Boston's St. Patrick's 
Day parade. He declared, ``History does not record that St. Patrick 
limited his ministry to heterosexuals or that General Washington's 
soldiers were all straight. Inclusiveness should be the hallmark of 
the parade.'' He held that it should be open to all participants who 
were peaceful. His decision was upheld in 1994, but was reversed in 
1995 by the U.S. Supreme Court. Flannery was born in West Pittston, 
Pa., and received a bachelor's degree in 1955 from Wilkes College 
in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and his law degree in 1958 from the University 
of Pennsylvania. He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Marie 
Nash, whom he married in 1967.
