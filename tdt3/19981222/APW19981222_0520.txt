The International Committee of the Red Cross - the main aid agency 
in Afghanistan _ wants 50 million Swiss francs (dlrs 36 million) next 
year for projects to help the population fend for itself. Red Cross 
delegate Juan Martinez said Tuesday that general economic hardship 
was growing, even though security had returned to most parts of the 
country after years of war. Such was the destitution and weariness 
of the people that none heeded the calls of the ruling Taliban religious 
army to demonstrate in favor of Iraq during the U.S. and British air 
strikes, said Martinez, who just completed a 14-month stint in Kabul. 
In contrast to the United Nations and most other relief organizations, 
the ICRC has continued its work under the Taliban, which now controls 
most of Afghanistan. ``We have had problems, but they haven't been 
insurmountable,'' said Martinez. ``We have ways of working based on 
patience and negotiation. That has paid dividends over time.'' The 
ICRC cut its foreign staff in Afghanistan from 100 to about 60 after 
an Italian U.N. worker was shot in August. U.N. international personnel 
pulled out altogether. The Taliban blamed the incident on renegade 
soldiers angry at U.S. missile attacks against suspected terrorist 
camps in eastern Afghanistan. Even prior to that, relations were tense, 
with the Taliban upset at not being given diplomatic recognition, 
and U.N. agencies angered at discrimination against women and ban 
on education for girls. ``It's easier for us than the United Nations 
because of the different mandates,'' said Martinez. ``The ICRC is 
considered by everyone as a neutral intermediary. The United Nations 
isn't.'' He said it also helped that the Geneva-based ICRC relied 
on discretion rather than publicity to get what it wanted. In July, 
dozens of private aid groups quit Kabul to protest a Taliban order 
forcing them to relocate to abandoned school dormitories. They are 
beginning to trickle back _ on the Taliban's terms _ but haven't yet 
resumed full-scale operations. Red Cross aid programs are concentrated 
on 200,000 of the most vulnerable people in Kabul _ including the 
handicapped and war widows who aren't allowed to work to feed their 
families. It also has medical care programs for women. Despite the 
immediate plight of hundreds of thousands of people, the ICRC wants 
to shift its focus on to longer-term projects to help them fend for 
themselves, said Martinez. After two decades of war and destruction, 
many have given up hope. ``We need projects that get people involved 
and that make them work and not just be dependent on aid,'' said Martinez. 
Rather than handing out charity, the Red Cross is getting people to 
work in return for food, he said. The appeal for 50 million francs 
will be made as part of an overall appeal for funds early next year.
