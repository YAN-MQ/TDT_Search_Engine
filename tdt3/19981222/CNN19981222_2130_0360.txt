The federal reserve has decided against making any additional changes 
in U.S. interest rates this year. It will keep the overnight bank 
lending rate at 4.75%, where it has stood since November 17th. Analysts 
indicate the fed may be trying to act as a stabilizing force in the 
marketplace. This was a good week. We had problems in Brazil, impeachment. 
We had a war and the market went up. The basic driver here is incredible 
liquidity. And now the fed may not lower rates any more, but it's 
not going to raise them. We're still in this global crisis into the 
year 2000. They're absolutely going to keep rates steady. They don't 
want to make things worse. The fed cut borrowing rates three times 
in the past three months to spur the U.S. economy in the wake of financial 
woes abroad.
