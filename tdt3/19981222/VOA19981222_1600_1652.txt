I'm Nancy Beardsly. Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates 
are about to take a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Well, 
let's take a look ahead to Wednesday's weather for our listeners and 
friends in Africa. Periods of clouds and sunshine, a cool 13 degrees 
for your high in Algiers. For Both, Morocco, 17 degrees, and pretty 
much the same outlook. And, in Tripoli, pretty much the same at 10 
degrees. Partly sunny and cool in Tunis, Tunisia with a high of 11 
degrees predicted for Wednesday. Mostly sunny, windy and humid in 
Obeshan, with a high of 30 degrees. A little bit warmer, 32 degrees 
in Abuja, Nigeria. Sunny and hot is the forecast. Accra Ghana, sunny 
and very windy. A humid 31 degrees on Wednesday. Abisabah, 27 and 
sunny. And, in Osmora, 23, sunny and breezy. It will be sunny and 
hot in Bamaco with a high of 32 degrees expected. Look for showers 
in Bujumbura with warm weather, a high of 27 degrees. And sunny and 
very windy and warm, high of 28 in Cape Town, South Africa. Conakry, 
mostly sunny, a warm 31 degrees on Wednesday. Dakar, Senegal, sunny, 
a pleasant 26 and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 32 for your Wednesday

Africa. Breezy and cool, a high of 21 degrees expected. Also, mostly

Now continues in just a moment. Stay tuned. It's in universal time, 
And this is VOA News Now. The United States says it's willing to consider 
expansion of the United Nation's Oil for Food program in Iraq. And, 
the United States and Britain have dismissed an Iraqi report that 
western war planes fired two missiles in the Bosnia area, Tuesday. 
And, on Dateline, corruption in government. It's all in this half-hour 
of VOA News Now. First, a summary of world news. I'm Robert Burns, 
VOA News.
