The New York Time said in an editorial for Wednesday, Dec. 23: The 
Supreme Court's unanimous ruling this month denying the police blanket 
authority to search a car after ticketing the driver for a minor traffic 
violation, such as speeding, was an important victory for privacy 
rights. At issue was an Iowa law that extended the power police now 
have to conduct a warrantless search when a driver is arrested. The 
new law allowed such searches even in routine traffic stops where 
there was no arrest and no suspicion of any criminal activity. Had 
the court gone the other way, such intrusions _ unnecessary to insuring 
officer safety or preserving evidence _ would have become widespread. 
The laudable ruling was a rare departure for a court that had just 
watered down privacy rights in the home by validating the peeping-Tom 
behavior of a Minnesota police officer. The officer saw two men bagging 
cocaine in a third person's basement apartment by peering through 
a gap in closed venetian blinds before obtaining a search warrant. 
A state court tossed out the narcotics convictions of the two men, 
concluding that the officer's warrantless snooping amounted to an 
illegal search of guests in a home. But a majority of the Supreme 
Court said the two men had ``no legitimate expectation of privacy'' 
in a home belonging to someone else that for them was ``simply a place 
to do business.'' Yet as Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in a spirited dissent, 
the refusal to honor the privacy rights of guests inevitably undermines 
the established privacy rights of the host, by giving police new incentive 
to pry illegally.
