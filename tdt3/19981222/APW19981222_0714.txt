Russia's parliament is likely to give the 1999 draft budget preliminary 
approval Thursday, lawmakers said Tuesday _ but final passage could 
still stall over squabbles during later debates. Russia desperately 
needs an austere, realistic budget for resolving the economic crisis. 
The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, is to begin discussing 
the draft budget Thursday. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ whose 
parliamentary faction has formed the main resistance to passage of 
the government's budgets in recent years _ said Tuesday that while 
he wasn't entirely pleased with the draft budget, his party would 
probably give it initial approval. ``We have a difficult choice between 
bad and very bad because the present government has inherited from 
its predecessors only debts and troubles, but no resources,'' Zyuganov 
told Russian news agencies. Communists are the largest group in parliament, 
and they have made the passage of past years' budgets stretch into 
months of rancorous debate. The budgets are generally passed months 
into the new year. But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's new Cabinet 
was formed as a compromise with the Communist opposition, and includes 
several communists. Because of that, many observers say Zyuganov may 
abandon his political grandstanding and opposition to the government. 
``The budget, it appears, should be passed on the first reading,'' 
Zyuganov said. Other factions also said they would support the budget 
during the first reading. However, the first reading has traditionally 
been the easiest hurdle to clear. The draft would then need to go 
through three more approvals. Major delays usually begin during the 
second reading, when lawmakers start to debate details of the distribution 
of budget funds. ``Delays with (the budget's) approval, development 
of all sorts of lobbyist processes in the Duma ... would not make 
the budget better, but would make it less and less realistic,'' President 
Boris Yeltsin's economic adviser Alexander Voloshin warned Tuesday. 
The Communists are calling for more state spending to help impoverished 
Russians and ailing industries. Zyuganov also said he wanted to see 
more money for the military, education and culture. But because of 
the economic crisis, the government has even less money to spend on 
these areas than in the past. For example, the draft budget envisages 
an increase of 80 billion rubles (dlrs 3.9 billion), or 22 percent, 
compared to last year in spending for science and support to impoverished 
people, Voloshin said. However, the budget also forecasts 30 percent 
inflation, so the ostensible increase will actually result in less 
money for those areas, Voloshin conceded. Russia's markets crumbled 
this summer, succumbing to global financial uncertainty, and the country 
is now facing its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
