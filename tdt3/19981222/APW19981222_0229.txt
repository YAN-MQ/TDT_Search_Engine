Philippine shares ended mixed Tuesday with Wall Street's overnight 
gains reviving interest in blue-chips, but failing to boost demand 
for second-liners, traders said. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange 
Index closed 20.51 points, or 1.1 percent, higher at 1,893.66, following 
its 13.21-point, or 0.7 percent, drop Monday to 1,873.15. Decliners, 
however, edged out gainers 45 to 43, while 45 issues were unchanged, 
based on preliminary results. Shares of San Miguel Corp. dominated 
trading on the back of persistent, though unconfirmed, reports that 
Filipino-Chinese tycoon Lucio Tan wants to revive his bid to take 
over the country's largest food and beverage conglomerate. Shares 
of Centennial City, a real estate holding company, rose 8.7 percent 
after President Joseph Estrada announced the government may sign a 
contract in January that would enable the firm to pursue its 750-hectare 
(1,853-acre) reclamation project along Manila Bay. The project was 
halted last year following allegations of bribery. Proponents of the 
project had to restart talks with the government on the terms of the 
joint venture. An endorsement by Estrada is seen advancing the multi-billion 
peso (multi-million dollar) project. Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn 
Securities Inc., said the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 85.22-point 
rise Monday to 8,988.85, gave investors reason to resume accumulating 
oversold index-heavyweight stocks. ``But people are still cautious,'' 
he said. ``They want to wait and see if the index run-up was just 
a reaction to Wall Street. If it turns out that way, the market may 
resume its downturn in the next sessions since there's no fundamental 
reason for the market to go up.'' The Philippine peso closed lower 
against the dollar in light trading Tuesday, weighed by the weaker 
regional currencies in reaction to dollar buying following Wall Street's 
gains, traders said. At the close, the dollar averaged 39.084 pesos 
on the Philippine Dealing System, up from Monday's average of 38.985 
pesos. The dollar traded at a thin rage of 39.040 pesos to 39.130 
pesos. It was last traded at 39.090 pesos. Volume totaled dlrs 61.2 
million compared with dlrs 81.6 million Monday. ``The peso merely 
took its cue from regional trading,'' a trader with a foreign bank 
said, noting actual dollar demand was scarce.
