South Korea's navy will hold an open bidding next year to buy several 
1,500-ton submarines worth 2 trillion won (dlrs 1.7 billion), Defense 
Ministry officials said Tuesday. Until now, the nation's Daewoo Heavy 
Industries Ltd. has been the sole provider of submarines for the navy. 
Since 1986, it has built the navy seven 1,200-ton submarines designed 
by Germany's Howaldatswerke Deutsche Werft AG. and is manufacturing 
two more for delivery by 2001. That prompted rival shipbuilder Hyundai 
Heavy Industries Co. to complain about what it called unfair competition. 
In June, the government's audit agency backed Hyundai's complaint. 
``We decided to hold an open bidding because competition will lead 
to technological development and more domestic production of submarine 
components,'' said Col. Chang Hyun-sup, a ministry spokesman. Chang 
said South Korea will first select a foreign submarine designer through 
the open bidding and then choose between Daewoo and Hyundai to build 
new submarines in a technological tie-up with that foreign company. 
He gave no further details. But the national Yonhap News Agency, quoting 
unidentified military sources, reported that five submarine manufacturers 
from Germany, Sweden, France and Russia have shown interest in the 
bidding. No South Korean company possesses the technology to build 
submarines on its own. South Korea's navy began buying submarines 
in 1986 to strengthen its military capabilities against communist 
North Korea. The two Koreas are technically in a state of war as their 
1950-53 war ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. North Korea 
has 35 Soviet-designed submarines, according to South Korean officials.
