President Clinton has warned Libya of stronger sanctions if its fails 
to hand over for trial two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am 
jet liner over Lockerbee, Scotland in 1988. Mr. Clinton issues the 
warning Monday during a Memorial service marking the tenth anniversary 
of the bombing that killed 270 people. The President said if the suspects 
are not turned over by the end of February, he will work with the 
United Nations to seek stronger measures against Libya.
