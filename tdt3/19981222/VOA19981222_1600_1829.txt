The United Nations' Security Council is continuing its discussions 
on Iraq, at this hour. The council is considering a proposal from 
Russia that would authorize an overall assessment of the situation 
concerning Iraq. VOA's United Nations Correspondent, Max Rustin, reports. 
The proposed Russian statement asks U.N. Secretary General, Kofi Annan, 
to submit, as soon as possible, an overall assessment of the current 
situation on the ground in Iraq in order to ensure the implementation 
of relevant council resolutions. In effect, Russia is looking to Mr. 
Annan to help repair deep divisions within the Council over how to 
maintain an effective system for monitoring Iraq's weapons program. 
If the Russian proposal is approved by the Council, Mr. Annan would 
likely have to suggest ways to reconstitute the U.N Special Weapon's 
Commission, UNSCOM, responsible for searching for weapons of mass 
destruction in Iraq. The Council is currently split over what, if 
anything, should be done to change the composition of that commission. 
The Security Council is scheduled to continue its discussions on Iraq, 
on Wednesday. Max Rustin, VOA News United Nations.
