look and feel like Christmas in some places with deadly results. The 
president and the move to censure. One key republican says not so 
fast, there's crucial evidence that's yet to be released. And from 
Jesse the candidate to the governor-elect. Tonight, Maria shriver's 
"Dateline" report. Good Wednesday evening to you. In aaddition to 
those headline stories tonight we'll be joined in just a Moment by 
two respected members of the U.S. Senate as the president's punishment 
debate moves forward.
