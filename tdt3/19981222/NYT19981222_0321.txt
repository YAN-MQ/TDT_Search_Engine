Fearing that it will hurt negotiations with the players union, Commissioner 
David Stern has steadfastly refused to issue a so-called drop-dead 
date that would signal the cancellation of the entire 1998-99 National 
Basketball Association season. But as the league's contentious labor 
dispute motors toward its sixth month without resolution, it appears 
that such a date is within days of being announced. League officials 
are considering a date for a special Board of Governors meeting to 
be convened the first week of January in New York. The main item on 
the agenda: a vote of representatives from the 29 teams on whether 
to terminate what is left of the season. ``At some point, we'll have 
to have a board meeting to cancel the season,'' Russ Granik, the league's 
deputy commissioner, said Tuesday night. ``I don't know if you would 
call that a drop-dead date, but I guess some people will take it that 
way.'' Granik refused to release the date of the meeting or say when 
the season will be canceled if the two sides cannot negotiate a new 
collective bargaining agreement. The final decision rests with Stern, 
who is vacationing in Aspen, Colo., and is not planning to return 
until next week. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, returned 
home to Oakland, Calif., to spend the Christmas holiday with his family. 
Ten days after the last bargaining session, no new talks have been 
scheduled, though Hunter was planning to speak to Stern over the next 
couple of days, a union official said. As the owners and players battle 
over how to share $2 billion in revenue, the first three months of 
the season is about to be lost. Given that the season cannot start 
until the last week of January, at the earliest, more than $400 million 
in player salaries will be lost as well. Meanwhile, Kevin Willis of 
the Toronto Raptors became the second player in four days to publicly 
support an owners' proposal forwarded to the players last week by 
Stern. In an interview with The Associated Press, Willis called for 
players to vote on the proposal by secret ballot. ``The majority would 
vote for the owners' latest proposal, just to start playing ball again,'' 
Willis said. Forward Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz said on Saturday 
that he thought the deal was fair, though he added that it needed 
some ``minor adjustments.'' Willis' comments weren't surprising, given 
that his agent, Steven Woods of Atlanta, has harshly criticized Hunter; 
Patrick Ewing, the union president, and the union itself the past 
few months. In October, he was escorted by security guards from a 
players meeting in Las Vegas. ``We conducted conference calls over 
the last two weeks with more than 120 players on each call,'' said 
Dan Wasserman, the union's communications director. ``At least a dozen 
players on each call specifically told us they will wait for the negotiating 
committee to recommend a deal that is worthy of putting to a vote. 
``Every player is entitled to his opinion, although we have not heard 
from Kevin Willis directly. But the vast majority of players support 
the authority of the negotiating committee to recommend a deal.'' 
With both sides still trying to hash out key economic issues relating 
to how the league will do business the next six to seven years, union 
and league officials are beginning to acknowledge that time for a 
settlement is running out. Hunter has said that the two sides are 
not as far apart as many observers believe, and that a deal can be 
struck within 24 hours if the parties show a willingness to compromise. 
But getting lawyers and the chief negotiators into a room for that 
meeting is another story. The next meeting will most likely not take 
place before Monday. Two union officials, speaking on the condition 
of anonymity, said that if a deal cannot be struck between Jan. 5 
and 10, at the latest, they believe Stern will cancel the season. 
``They're in the right time frame,'' Granik said. ``We don't want 
this to be a fatalistic situation. Frankly, I'll be surprised if we 
don't have another meeting before canceling the season. But right 
now, I don't have any reason to be optimistic about the results.''
