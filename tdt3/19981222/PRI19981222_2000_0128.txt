Israel says it is not putting the peace process on hold because of 
early elections. Voting is expected to take place in three to four 
months, and campaigning has already begun. Jerusalem, Lyse Doucet 
reports. Opinion polls show that the leader of the opposition Labor 
Party, Ehud Barak, the former army chief, could beat Binyamin Netanyahu 
in a straight contest for the premiership. But Israel's political 
map is being redrawn. Several members of Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party 
have said they'll run against him. As Mr. Netanyahu fights for his 
political life, he's unlikely to press ahead with the peace deal he 
signed only a few months ago in Washington. Lyse Doucet, BBC, Jerusalem. 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart says he is confident the Wye River 
agreement will be honored.
