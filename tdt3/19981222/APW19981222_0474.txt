Police have completed an investigation into the shooting death of 
Polish woman who worked for the United Nations in Georgia, and the 
case has been sent to court, an official said Tuesday. Maria Magdalena 
Wewiorska, 31, was shot at point-blank range on July 14 when she apparently 
startled a burglar in her apartment in central Tbilisi. The suspect, 
20-year-old Zurab Bregvadze of Georgia, was arrested in August. The 
case was sent to Tbilisi municipal court last Friday, and hearings 
are expected to begin on Jan. 25, court official Irina Dzhaparidze 
said. Bregvadze, who lived near Wewiorska, was identified by neighbors 
who reported seeing him run out of her house shortly after the shooting, 
police officials said. U.N. officials said Wewiorska had moved to 
Tbilisi to work as a secretary for the head of the U.N. mission in 
Georgia. U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between 
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea province 
of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province in a 1992-93 
war.
