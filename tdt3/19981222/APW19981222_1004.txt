Israeli warplanes fired missiles at suspected guerrilla bases in eastern 
Lebanon Tuesday, killing a woman and her six children, Lebanese security 
officials said. Israel expressed regret at the deaths, the highest 
civilian casualties in an Israeli raid since a 17-day bombing blitz 
of Lebanon in 1996. Lebanese security officials said one Israeli rocket 
crashed on a farm where a couple and their seven children resided 
in the village of Nabi Sheet, about 23 kilometers (14 miles) southwest 
of the ancient city of Baalbek. The mother and six children aged between 
two and 13 were killed. The father, Mohammed Othman, and an 11-year-old 
son were wounded, the officials said, speaking on customary condition 
of anonymity. ``I felt I was lifted from the ground and then everything 
went black,'' Othman, who suffered shrapnel wounds, said from his 
hospital bed in Baalbek. Local television stations showed blackened 
limbs and other charred remains of the dead wrapped in blankets at 
a morgue. Lebanese officials said five other air-to-surface missiles 
also hit the hills around the villages of Nabi Sheet and Janta in 
the Bekaa Valley. The officials said a guerrilla from the Shiite Muslim 
militant Hezbollah was killed and another wounded in the attack. But 
a Hezbollah official in Beirut said he was not aware of any guerrilla 
death. Lebanon's government complained to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan and called for a meeting of a multinational committee monitoring 
an understanding between Israel and the guerrillas on not attacking 
civilians. Israel's army said in Jerusalem it regretted the loss of 
civilian life. It said the jets struck a civilian target by mistake 
while targeting a guerrilla training facility and broadcast station 
The army called it a ``malfunction.'' The Hezbollah confirmed that 
its radio transmitter on the edge of Nabi Sheet was destroyed. The 
radio, however, remained on the air, apparently using a backup transmitter. 
No other details were available. Israeli fighter bombers also fired 
four rockets earlier Tuesday at suspected guerrilla bases facing Israel's 
self-styled ``security zone'' in an occupied portion of South Lebanon. 
There were no casualties from the raid. Hezbollah, the guerrilla group 
leading the fight against Israel's occupation of a border zone in 
the south, promised to avenge the ``atrocious crime.'' Israeli authorities 
warned residents of northern Israeli communities to spend the night 
in bomb shelters in case rockets were fired. Israeli warplanes flew 
over southern Lebanon Tuesday night, occasionally dropping flares 
apparently to thwart guerrilla movements along the front line.
