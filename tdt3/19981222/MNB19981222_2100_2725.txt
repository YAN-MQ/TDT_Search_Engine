When we come back, Jesse Ventura explains why he thinks he can survive 
the political wars sure to come. In part two of his conversation with 
Maria shriver from "dateline NBC." Hey, Freddie. I need a little information. 
Well, my mind's a little fuzzy, chief. This clear it up? Mercury mountaineer. 
Available V-8, all-wheel drive, leather trim interior, six-disc C.D. 
changer. I hear it's very comfortable. You're good, kid. Where do 
you get your information anyway? That's my little secret. Power moonroof, 
standard fog lamps, cast aluminum wheels. There was a time when memories 
were painful. They just reminded me of how far away I was from feeling 
like myself. I couldn't get out of bed. I was always tired. I hardly 
ate. I stopped wanting to be around people. Sometimes, I felt like, 
"what's the use?" My friends, they'd say, "cheer up. You have everything." 
But I was so depressed, I couldn't snap out of it. You can't just 
snap out of clinical depression. No one can because it's a real illness 
with real causes. But you can get your life back. A first step is 
giving us a call. We'll send you a free, confidential information 
kit... with facts about depression and treatment that's worked for 
millions... and a symptoms checklist that can make it easier... to 
talk with a doctor about how you're feeling. Now, I already have my 
wish. I have my life back.
