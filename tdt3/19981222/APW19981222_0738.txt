Barely three years ago before Tiger Woods made his phenomenal impact 
on the game, Nick Faldo was the bookmakers favorite to win any of 
the Majors. After the worst slump of his spectacular career, he's 
now quoted at 40-1 to win the Masters, the British Open or the PGA 
and 50-1 for the US Open. And this is the man who has won three Masters 
and three British Opens. The odds on Colin Montgomerie, who has never 
won a Major, are half the odds on Faldo. ``Three years ago Faldo was 
the automatic favorite to win any tournament, including any of the 
majors,'' said Andy Clifton, spokesman for bookmakers Ladbrokes. ``Even 
for the Open of '97 we quoted him as 16-1. At this year's event he 
was 80-1. That's how bad he was in the first half of the year.'' Yet 
Faldo ended 1998 with a title when he partnered David Carter to victory 
for England at the World Cup in New Zealand. ``A win is a win,'' Clifton 
said. ``But the conditions were very British Open type weather with 
strong winds. And it was not exactly a world class field. ``We are 
yet to be convinced. We are yet to see him perform well in a big tournament 
with plenty of pressure on. ``He wants to play in three or four of 
the new World Tour events and that means being in the top 64 in the 
world. He's just about on the bubble and needs to come out firing 
on all cylinders in the first half of the year to make sure on in 
them,'' Clifton said. ``He's swinging the ball OK but he can't get 
the putts when it really matters and that just affects his confidence.'' 
Ladbrokes quotes Woods as clear favorite to win any of the Majors. 
He's 5-1 for the Masters (next best David Duval at 14-1), 8-1 fpor 
the British Open (Lee Westwood at 14-1), 9-1 for the US Open (14-1 
Ernie Els) and 9-1 for the PGA (Duval, Els and Westwood all at 16-1)
