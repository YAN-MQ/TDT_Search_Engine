Japan's central bank chief says he sees some bright signs in the world's 
second largest economy, but warns hard times remain. Bank of Japan 
Governor Massaru Hayami says public spending is climbing; there appears 
to be a slowdown in the sharp fall in production. But, he says, there 
is little to encourage capital spending or private consumption. Prices 
continue to fall; investors remain concerned about liquidity and credit 
risks.
