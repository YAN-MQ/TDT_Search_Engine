Bulgaria's former king arrived Tuesday to celebrate Christmas and 
New Year in his homeland for the first time in 52 years of living 
abroad. Simeon II was accompanied by his wife, Queen Margarita, and 
one of their five children, Kalina. They will spend the holidays at 
the Czarska Bistritsa palace, in the alpine Rila Mountain, some 60 
kilometers (40 miles) south of Sofia. Meeting reporters and a few 
supporters at the Sofia airport, Simeon said his feeling of being 
back home ``was beyond description'' and wished that ``1999 be better 
for all Bulgarians.'' The small palace is part of the real estate 
Simeon is to reclaim after a high court earlier this year reversed 
the communist nationalization of two palaces, three hunting villas 
and three country houses owned by his ancestors. All places have served 
as government mansions so far. Simeon is expected to visit them during 
his stay, scheduled to end Jan. 7. Simeon will still have to pay for 
staying in Czarska Bistritsa until legal procedures returning the 
palace are completed and he pays due taxes, the minister of public 
administration, Mario Tagarinski, told the state news agency BTA. 
Bulgarian media have reported that Simeon intends to donate some of 
his property for public use. Simeon, now a businessman living in Madrid, 
Spain, was welcomed by enthusiastic crowds during two visits here 
in previous years. He acceded to the throne at the age of 6 in 1943, 
when his father, Boris III, died shortly after allying Bulgaria with 
Nazi Germany. Simeon reigned under regencies until 1946, when the 
communists, installed by the Soviet army in 1944, abolished the monarchy 
in a referendum widely suspected of being rigged.
