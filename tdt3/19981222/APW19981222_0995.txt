The foreign ministers of Egypt and Libya on Tuesday discussed the 
possible trial of two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, 
and the U.S.-Britain airstrikes on Iraq. Egypt's Middle East News 
Agency said Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and his Libyan counterpart, 
Omar al-Muntasser, discussed the Lockerbie issue in the light of the 
Libyan Parliament's approval for trying the suspects in a third country. 
It gave no other details. The two ministers also discussed the Iraq 
crisis and the U.N sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait 
in 1990, the agency said. Al-Muntasser arrived in Cairo Monday. Libya 
already has accepted in principle to the trial of the two suspects 
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands but demanded 
that, if convicted, they should be jailed in Libya. The Dec. 21, 1988 
bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270 people. 
The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, also gave its conditional 
approval last week for the trial of the two men in a country other 
than the United States or Britain. The United States and Britain insist 
that the two men should spend the jail term in Britain. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, speaking at a memorial service Monday on the bombing's 
10th anniversary, warned that the United States would seek even stronger 
measures against Libya if the suspects were not turned over. Libya 
is under U.N. air sanctions aimed at forcing its government to hand 
over the suspects.
