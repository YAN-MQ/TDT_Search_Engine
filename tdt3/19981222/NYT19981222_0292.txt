Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its long-term credit ratings Tuesday 
on Toshiba Corp.'s debt, saying the company's efforts to strengthen 
itself financially will likely be hurt by a swift erosion in cash 
flow and adverse global market conditions. The downgrade was sobering 
because Toshiba, which manufactures everything from batteries and 
household appliances to power generation equipment and sophisticated 
computer chips, is regarded here as having gone further than most 
corporations to overhaul itself. Under its president, Taizo Nishimuro, 
the company has exited less profitable businesses, streamlined corporate 
governance and adopted a plan to reduce jobs. The company also intends 
to reduce the number of affiliates _ and therefore obligations to 
them _ to 300, from 1,000, by April 1999, and to whittle its labor 
force to 60,000, from 66,000, by 2000. But Standard &AMP; Poor's was 
apparently unswayed, pushing the company's long-term ratings to triple-B-plus 
from A-minus. ``Although these actions will help the company improve 
its performance over the next several years, the scale and timing 
of the benefits of restructuring are uncertain,'' the ratings agency 
said. It pointed to weakness in the semiconductor market, a slowdown 
in capital investment among Japanese electrical companies and the 
uncertain demand for personal computers. Toshiba shares, which had 
risen 50 percent over the last three months on the company's restructuring 
efforts, fell 4 percent, or 28 yen, on the downgrade news to 677 yen, 
or about $5.84. A lowered credit rating can make it more expensive 
for corporations to borrow by issuing bonds, because investors demand 
a higher rate of return on securities considered more risky. But Toshiba 
said through a spokesman that the company did not expect the ratings 
change to significantly increase its borrowing costs.
