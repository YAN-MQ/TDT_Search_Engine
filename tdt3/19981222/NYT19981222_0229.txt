As the eight babies born to a Houston woman on Sunday struggled to 
survive as the first known living octuplets, donors from around Texas 
and across the country pledged money and goods to help the new family. 
``There have been no significant changes in the babies' conditions,'' 
said Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatalogy at Texas Children's Hospital, 
where the six girls and two boys remain under sedation and on a diet 
of sugar and water. ``In these cases, no news is good news.'' Officials 
at Texas Children's Hospital, where the babies remained in critical 
but stable condition, and at the adjacent St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, 
where the octuplets' mother, Nkem Chukwu, 27, is described as alert 
and excited following surgery to correct internal bleeding, say they 
have received a steady stream of calls and packages. ``We have gotten 
a lot of interest, though I think some people around the country are 
waiting to see how the babies do,'' said Katy Gill, director of development 
at Texas Children's Hospital. ``In this case, because the babies are 
so critical, a lot of people may be waiting to see if they survive.'' 
A Houston-based food chain, Randall's Food Markets, has donated a 
year's worth of groceries for the Chukwus. A national company, Drypers, 
has donated a lifetime supply of baby wipes and disposable training 
pants. Another company, which asked to remain anonymous, donated a 
lifetime supply of diapers. Mead Johnson Nutritionals donated a year's 
worth of infant formula. The producers of Maury Povich's television 
show, ``The New Maury Show,'' have arranged to provide eight cribs 
to hold the Chukwu children. Holt Educational Outlet, manufacturers 
and distributors of educational toys, say they will donate a full 
array of toys as soon as it is clear what products best fit the children's 
needs. Foley's, the department store chain, called the hospital (``as 
they always do in these cases,'' Ms. Gill said) and said they would 
provide what the family needed in baby car seats or infant clothes. 
The most unusual call, said Mari Anne Dwyer, assistant director of 
hospital philanthropy at St. Luke's, came from Excalibur Tire and 
Wheel, a Houston chain of auto supply stores, offering the Chukwus 
a lifetime supply of tires and oil changes. ``It's so sweet,'' Ms. 
Dwyer said. Ms. Chukwu, who had been trying to have children for several 
years and had miscarried triplets earlier this year, learned 12 weeks 
into her pregnancy that she was carrying multiple embryos, but declined 
for religious reasons to allow doctors to reduce the number of embryos. 
The sensational nature of the case _ marking the fifth known time 
in the world that more than seven children were delivered and the 
only known time that all have survived _ has revived the debate among 
doctors over the ethical use of fertility drugs when so-called high 
order multiple births, triplets or more, most often end in tragedy 
for at least some of the children. Hospital officials said Tuesday 
that many of the calls came from individuals who wanted to give money 
to the new family. Ms. Dwyer said that St. Luke's Hospital would accept 
checks made payable to the Chukwu Family Fund until a more permanent 
fund for the family can be set up in the next few days. Meanwhile, 
Chido Nwangwu, the Houston-based publisher of two national magazines 
and two Internet sites aimed at Africans and black Americans, said 
he was trying to rally support in the black community for the octuplets' 
parents, both American citizens born in Nigeria. ``Our thought is 
to stimulate the spirit of community service and volunteerism for 
all people, regardless of race or culture,'' Nwangwu said. ``And we 
want particularly to make certain that these children get the same 
kind of support, regardless of their culture, that have been given 
to other multiple-birth babies in the past.'' Ms. Chukwu and her husband, 
Iyke, a respiratory therapist in Houston, have asked hospital officials 
to shield them and their babies from the dozens of reporters and television 
crews camped outside the hospitals and they have allowed no pictures 
and given no interviews.
