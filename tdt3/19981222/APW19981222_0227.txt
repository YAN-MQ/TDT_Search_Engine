Although strongly opposed to the U.S.-led bombing of Iraq, China offered 
Tuesday to work with the United States to resolve the crisis over 
U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao 
said China and the United States should work together in the U.N. 
Security Council. ``This is not only good for the restoration of world 
peace and security but also for the healthy and stable development 
of China-U.S. relations,'' Zhu said. The U.S. and British airstrikes 
on Iraq last week left the Security Council sharply divided, especially 
over the future of the inspections. Under the Gulf War cease-fire, 
the inspectors need to certify Iraq has dismantled its missiles and 
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons before sanctions can be lifted. 
Russia and China want the sanctions removed and have demanded the 
ouster of the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, who heads the 
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM. Zhu did not offer any new 
suggestions for resolving the crisis, except to say that China was 
considering whether UNSCOM's ``approach and composition'' should be 
changed. The United States and Britain want UNSCOM to continue its 
job and support Butler. Butler's report last week concluding Iraq 
failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors triggered four 
days of air strikes.
