Israeli warplanes struck twice in Lebanon, Tuesday, against what were 
said to be Hesbola guerrilla targets. One air strike was deep in Syrian 
controlled territory in the historic town of Baalbek. And, civilian 
casualties were reported. VOA's David Gullis has more from Jerusalem. 
The Israeli military statement said both air strikes were directed 
against Hesbola targets, the first just north of Israel's self-declared 
Lebanon security zone, and the other far to the north in the Bekaa 
valley on the Syrian border. No details of casualties or damage were 
given here, but news reports quoting Lebanese officials said rockets 
fired in the second attack hit a Hesbola radio station and training 
camp, but also a nearby farm house, killing a Lebanese woman and six 
of her children. Her husband, and another child, were reported injured 
along with two guerrillas. Israel has staged more than 100 air strikes 
in Lebanon this year, but the planes rarely venture into the northern 
Bekaa. As Hesbola has been waging a guerrilla campaign to drive Israel 
out of the buffer strip it has occupied in Lebanon since 1985. David 
Gullis, VOA News, Jerusalem.
