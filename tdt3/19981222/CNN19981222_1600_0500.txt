This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map. The cold front moves off the east coast and takes most 
of the precipitation with it. However, as we put our map in motion, 
you will see precipitation begin to develop in the lower Mississippi 
river valley in parts of Texas and louisiana. It will stretch eastward. 
Some precipitation could continue to develop as we head into tomorrow 
night. Much of the nation will remain dry. Here is your forecast for 
high temperatures. It's cold throughout the country. Temperatures 
are a little bit warmer in the upper midwest and the northern rockies. 
We move into our extended forecast on Thursday. There is the threat 
of ice in parts of the south. Temperatures continue to warm ever so 
slightly as we go through the remainder of the week. On Friday, you 
can see teens and 20s throughout much of the north a few scattered 
showers are possible in the southeast. As we move into Saturday, temperatures 
are considerably warmer. Scattered showers possible in the east. For 
more weather information log on to CNN.com.
