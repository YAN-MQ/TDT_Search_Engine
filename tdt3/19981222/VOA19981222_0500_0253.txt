Western diplomats who monitor human rights activities in China say 
they have been informed that Chin Young Min, a co-founder of the fledgling 
China Democracy Party, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison. VOA's 
Roger Wilkeson reports Mr. Chin is the third prominent Chinese dissident 
in the past two days to receive a lengthy jail term for what the government 
calls subversion. Just like his associates Chu Wend Lee and Wang Yotsi 
who were sentenced on Monday to 13 years and 11 years in jail, respectively, 
Mr. Chin was accused of subverting the power of the state for trying 
to set up an opposition party. The harsh sentences have drawn condemnation 
from Western governments and human rights organizations. The sentences 
meted out to the three dissidents came 10 weeks after China signed 
a United Nations convention on civil and political rights that guarantees 
freedom of assembly and speech. But the Chinese legislature has not 
yet ratified the convention. The three men were tried separately following 
a nationwide crackdown on members of the would-be opposition party. 
China's official Chinwa News Agency quoted court documents as saying 
Mr. Chu and Mr. Wang accepted money from foreign-based organizations, 
but it gave no further details. Roger Wilkeson, VOA News, Beijing.
