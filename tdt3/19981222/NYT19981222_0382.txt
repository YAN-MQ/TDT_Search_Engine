Allan D'Arcangelo, a painter known for pared-down images of highways 
and road signs that neatly split the difference between Pop Art and 
Minimalism, died on Dec. 17 at Beth Israel North in Manhattan. He 
was 68 and lived on an 80-acre farm in the Catskills, near Kenoza 
Lake, N.Y. The cause was leukemia, his family said. D'Arcangelo was 
born in Buffalo in 1930, the son of Italian immigrants. He received 
a bachelor's degree in history at the University of Buffalo in 1953 
and briefly considered law school. But an interest in culture drew 
him to Manhattan, where he studied writing at the New School and education 
at City College and started visiting art galleries where he encountered 
the work of the Abstract Expressionists. After a brief stint in the 
Army in the mid-1950s, he used the GI Bill to study painting at Mexico 
City College for two years, returning to New York in 1959. Until then 
he had worked in a roughly painted figurative style that had affinities 
to folk art. But he soon responded to the cool sensibility that was 
emerging in the work of artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. 
By the time of his first solo show, at the Fischbach Gallery in 1963, 
he had reduced his forms to geometric shapes and adopted as his subject 
the American highway, plunging toward the distant horizon between 
crisp straight lines. These works were well received and earned D'Arcangelo 
a place in the first generation of Pop artists. His efforts were often 
linked to the American Precisionists and shared some of the graphic 
flatness of Hard-Edge paintings and the simple industrial forms of 
Minimalism. But they also had an air of slightly morose desolation 
and vastness, and it made sense that D'Arcangelo often cited de Chirico 
as one of his main influences. D'Arcangelo exhibited regularly in 
Europe and New York throughout the 1960s and joined the Marlborough 
Gallery in 1971. Starting with the 1964 New York World's Fair, he 
executed numerous mural commissions, both public and private. He taught 
throughout his career, most consistently at the School of Visual Arts 
(1963-68 and 1982-92) and Brooklyn College (1973-92). In the early 
1970s, D'Arcangelo moved to his farm near Kenoza Lake, where he continued 
to paint in a style that was at first more realistic and then became 
gradually rougher and more primitive. His life-long interest in ancient 
cultures was also expressed in a natural stone compass rose, or sun 
clock, measuring 40 feet in diameter, that he built on his land. D'Arcangelo's 
marriage to Sylvia Resnick ended in divorce. He is survived by a son, 
Gideon, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Gabrielle Walters of Chico, Calif.; 
a brother, Mark, of Fairfield, Conn., and a sister, Bernadette Gorski, 
of Cheshire, Conn.
