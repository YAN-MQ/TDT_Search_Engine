A Rome prosecutor has asked that Abdullah Ocalan be put back in jail, 
saying the Kurdish rebel leader must be kept under surveillance in 
case an appeals court rules in favor of his extradition to Turkey. 
Italy has so far refused to extradite Ocalan, citing laws that forbid 
it from extraditing suspects to countries where they face the death 
penalty. But the Rome prosecutor in charge of the case, Giovanni Malerba, 
on Monday indicated that Ocalan could be extradited for crimes that 
are not punishable with the death penalty. Turkey considers Ocalan 
a terrorist and is the country's No. 1 fugitive. Ocalan, who heads 
the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, was arrested Nov. 12 when he 
flew into Rome from Moscow. He was freed a week later but ordered 
not to leave Rome. Last week, Rome's appeals court lifted all restrictions 
on the Kurdish rebel after Germany withdrew an international arrest 
warrant it had issued against him for its own terrorism charges. Italy's 
justice minister must now decide whether to take up Malerba's request 
for a new arrest warrant. Ocalan has requested political asylum in 
Italy, but Premier Massimo D'Alema's center-left government is split 
over what to do. The possibilities mentioned include sending Ocalan 
to a third-country. South Africa, Libya, Pakistan or North Korea have 
been mentioned as possibilities. Close to 37,000 people have been 
killed since Ocalan's rebel group began fighting for autonomy in southeast 
Turkey in 1984.
