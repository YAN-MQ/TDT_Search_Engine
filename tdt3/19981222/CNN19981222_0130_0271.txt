Israeli lawmakers will try to decide this week when to hold elections. 
The parliament voted overwhelmingly today to dissolve itself and hold 
early elections. The vote came after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 
coalition of right-wing parties collapsed. Many of them would not 
support the wye river agreement with the palestinians. Netanyahu wants 
to delay elections until April 27th, so that balloting comes close 
to the deadline when the Palestinian authority plans to declare a 
state. The labor party wants to hold voting earlier, around March 
17th.
