Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told Iran's visiting foreign 
minister on Tuesday he is worried about suspicions that Iran is supplying 
missile parts to countries like North Korea, a report said. Obuchi 
said that Iranian efforts to allay such fears would help contribute 
to the development of bilateral ties, Kyodo News reported, quoting 
a Japanese government official. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, 
who is on a three-day visit to Tokyo, declined to comment on the issue 
during his meeting with Obuchi, Kyodo said. Tokyo has become deeply 
concerned about North Korean missile development after the Stalinist 
state fired a rocket in August that flew over Japan. U.S. and Japanese 
officials believe the launch was a ballistic missile test. Japanese 
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura invited Kharrazi during a trip to 
Tehran last April. Kharrazi's visit is the first by an Iranian foreign 
minister to Japan in 11 years.
