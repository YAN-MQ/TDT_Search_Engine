Russia's parliament has put off debate on the START II treaty until 
next spring at the earliest, dashing hopes that it might act soon 
on the arms control agreement with the United States, reports said 
Tuesday. After refusing to act on the treaty for several years, parliament 
was showing signs that it was ready to move. A visiting U.S. delegation 
said earlier this month that it thought Russia's parliament might 
ratify the treaty before the end of this year. But the recent U.S. 
bombing campaign against Iraq has stirred up anti-American sentiment 
in Russia. Vladimir Ryzhkov, the deputy speaker of parliament's lower 
house, said the treaty was put on the agenda for the spring session 
of the State Duma. ``This, of course, does not guarantee either the 
ratification of the START II treaty, or even that it will be considered 
by the State Duma,'' he told Russian news agencies. ``It simply shows 
that the State Duma intends to continue work in this direction.'' 
Ryzhkov is a moderate who supports the treaty. But he said Russian 
lawmakers still had a ``sharply negative attitude'' toward last week's 
U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq. The two countries bombed 
Iraq for refusing to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors. 
Russia and the United States signed the START II treaty in 1993, and 
the U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996. Communists and other hard-liners 
in Russia's parliament have opposed the treaty on the grounds it could 
weaken Russia's security and would be too expensive to implement. 
The treaty calls for both countries to cut their nuclear arsenals 
in half to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each. Russian military officials 
say many of the country's nuclear weapons are nearing the end of their 
service life and will have to be dismantled regardless of whether 
the parliament ratifies the treaty.
