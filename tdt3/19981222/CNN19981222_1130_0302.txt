Prime minister Netanyahu is ridiculing what he calls the ambitions 
of his political rivals. After yesterday's vote to absolve itself 
and hold early elections, netanyahu began campaigning today. The vote 
looks to happen by the end of April. Yesterday's parliament action 
came after Netanyahu's coalition of right-wing parties collapsed. 
Many of them would not support the wye river agreement with the palestinians.
