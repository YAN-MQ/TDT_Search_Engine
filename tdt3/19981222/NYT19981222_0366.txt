Having carried out its attack on Iraq, the United States has begun 
to reduce its forces in the Persian Gulf, withdrawing more than three 
dozen fighters, bombers and other aircraft ordered to the region over 
the last month, Pentagon officials said Tuesday. The Pentagon also 
plans to order the aircraft carrier Enterprise, whose Navy and Marine 
fighter jets provided much of the punch in last week's attack on Iraq, 
to leave the gulf, along with its armada of cruisers, destroyers, 
attack submarines and support ships by the end of the week. Once the 
withdrawals are completed, the American force in the region will return 
to roughly the size it was before this latest confrontation with President 
Saddam Hussein over United Nations weapon inspections, military officials 
said. With nearly 200 aircraft and a dozen warships led by the carrier 
Carl Vinson, the United States will still have enough fire power in 
the region, they said, to carry out additional strikes as the administration 
has vowed to do if Iraq does anything provocative. ``We're satisfied 
our day-to-day force _ what we call our near-continuous force _ is 
adequate,'' Marine Corps Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the commander of all 
American forces in the region, said in an interview. The Pentagon 
announced the reductions on Tuesday as Zinni and Defense Secretary 
William Cohen left Washington for a pre-Christmas tour of American 
troops in the gulf, arriving here early Wednesday morning at this 
remote desert base southeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Zinni, 
Cohen and other administration officials have portrayed the four days 
of strikes _ by far the most punishing attack on Iraq since the Gulf 
War _ as an unalloyed success, but questions remain about the attacks' 
long-term impact. In an interview on the way to Saudi Arabia, for 
example, Zinni said that Hussein's government would quickly be able 
to rebuild the communications system needed to keep a firm grip on 
the country. He also said for the first time that Iraq's seemingly 
feeble anti-aircraft fire had forced pilots to abort strikes on some 
sites, though he described those targets as secondary ones. Cohen, 
for his part, said the raids appeared to have done little to force 
Hussein to comply once again with the weapons inspection. On the contrary, 
he said, those seem certain to end for good now. ``I have not seen 
any evidence of behavior modification on the part of Saddam Hussein,'' 
Cohen said. ``I think he is going to continue to try to frustrate 
the inspections and try to get relief from the sanctions. I think 
that has been his goal all along. And he will do whatever he can to 
portray himself as a victim, hoping the world has suffered some case 
of accommodating amnesia.'' At the peak of the strikes over the weekend, 
the United States had 301 aircraft in the gulf, half of them aboard 
the Enterprise and the Carl Vinson. The combat jets being withdrawn 
include 12 of the 15 B-52's that battered Iraq with 90 air-launched 
cruise missiles from the British base on Diego Garcia, an island in 
the Indian Ocean. Six B-1's that had been based in Oman _ and took 
part in the bombers' first combat missions after three decades of 
troubled development _ are returning to the United States, as are 
10 A-10 attack jets and 10 KC-10 aerial tankers.
