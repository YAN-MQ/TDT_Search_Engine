The International Monetary Fund Monday said interest rate cuts in 
the industrial world have eased the threat that the Asia Financial 
Crisis will trigger a global recession. But the IMF's Flemming Larson 
says risks are evident, including in Japan. We have seen in policy 
measures recently to speed up the restructuring and re-capitalization 
of the banking system and also to ensure the maintenance of an adequate 
level of policy stimulus, both fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus. 
But there's still uncertainty about the implementation of many of 
the measures and about the speed of recovery in Japan. vvv The IMF 
has trimmed its forecast for world growth in 1999 to 2.2 percent, 
down from the 2.5 percent predicted last September.
