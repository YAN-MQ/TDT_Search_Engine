It's time now for a look at the weather across the country and for 
that we go to WNBC television in New York and Janice huff. Hi, Soledad. 
We're working on a white Christmas here in the northeast. Temperatures 
frigidly cold in the last 24 hours and now a major ice and snow storm 
is developing and maintaining itself over the mid atlantic states 
tonight. Extending back down to sections of Texas and into the northeast, 
closer to New York City, snow is starting to fall at J.F.K. airport 
and down towards wilmington, Delaware, and Philadelphia. Look at the 
bone-chilling collingd over the northern plains. Minus 3 in international 
faufments the only warm spot across the nation will be south Florida. 
30's even in the deserts of Arizona and southern California tonight. 
Highs in the 50's and 60's there tomorrow. Look at the 30's deep in 
the heart of Texas for highs tomorrow. Look out for some snow on Christmas 
eve in Washington and Boston, could find airport delays in Atlanta. 
Over the next several days things remain about the samente have a 
happy holiday. Back to you. Thank you very much. Janice. Samed to 
you.
