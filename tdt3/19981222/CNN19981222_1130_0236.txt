Two top republican leaders have come out against David Duke's plans 
to run for Congress. The former Ku Klux Klan leader says he'll run 
for the house seat being vacated by Louisiana representative Bob Livingston. 
Livingston announced Saturday he would resign after an admission of 
marital infidelity. Republican national committee chairman Jim Nicholson 
says the party has no room for Duke. The republican leadership council's 
executive director adds, Duke's candidacy must be opposed.
