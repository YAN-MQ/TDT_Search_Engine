Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports." The Denver Broncos' perfect season 
has certainly turned sour. After a 13-0 start, the Broncos dropped 
their second straight game Monday night, 31-21, to the dolphins. Dan 
Marino won the battle of hall-of-fame quarterbacks. He threw four 
touchdowns for the 21st time in his career. That's an NFL record. 
When you play a team like Denver, you got to score every opportunity 
you get, because they have a lot of fire power. The way our defense 
played, you know, really caused our offense to step it up. We knew 
everybody had to play a good game to win tonight, because they're 
the best team in the league.
