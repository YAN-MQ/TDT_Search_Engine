U.S. political leaders are considering alternatives to a long trial 
in the Senate, on whether to remove President Clinton from office. 
Four republicans in the House, who voted to impeach Mr. Clinton, are 
now asking the Senate to consider censure rather than removal from 
office. Democratic senator, Christopher Dodd, says he believes the 
bipartisan consensus is emerging to censure the president. The house 
impeached Mr. Clinton, Saturday, for perjury and obstruction of justice 
arising from his efforts to conceal an affair.
