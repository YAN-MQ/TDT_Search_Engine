They came by airplane and bus and automobile. They came dressed in 
their navy blues with their hats on. Some brought their sons. Snapping 
flags at half-staff lined the route Tuesday for the funeral cortege 
in this small western Long Island town. Lt. Joseph Cavalieri was the 
last of three New York City firefighters to be buried after their 
lives ended in a wall of fire on Friday morning as they tried to save 
an elderly woman from her burning Brooklyn apartment building. His 
two comrades, James Bohan and Christopher Bopp, were laid to rest 
Monday, and the magnitude of the week's loss streaked tears across 
the rugged and clean-shaven faces of firefighters who came from across 
the continent, from as far way as the Yukon Territory and Texas. ``All 
three of these men and their families lost everything,'' said Dan 
McMurray, a firefighter from Toronto, in a raw, croaking voice. ``We 
do this job for our families, and when one loses, we all lose.'' The 
three men were assigned to Ladder Company 170 in Canarsie, Brooklyn, 
and had tried to save a 67-year-old woman who, fire officials believe, 
had started the fire by dropping a cigarette in her apartment. Cavalieri, 
42, who had been highly decorated, was leading his two colleagues 
in the search for trapped people, including the woman. The men did 
not know that she had taken refuge elsewhere. While they were struggling 
through the heavy smoke on the 10th floor at 17 Vandalia Ave., high 
winds from an open door caused a fireball to shoot down the hall like 
a bullet down the barrel of a gun, fire officials said. Officials 
have also discovered that the sprinkler system was not working, but 
finger-pointing and recrimination were absent Tuesday as people came 
to remember and honor a brave man. ``He was a great man, a better 
guy than I'll ever be,'' said Firefighter Joe Tursi, who worked in 
the Canarsie firehouse with Cavalieri. ``It's tough, but we go on 
because it's our job.'' It was a coarse and rainy day for a funeral. 
It began with a procession from the Malverne Funeral Home led by a 
motorcade, followed by a ladder truck from Company 170, then the Pipe 
and Drum Corps and, finally, the fire engine carrying the draped casket 
of Cavalieri. As the Rev. Donald Baier waited with clasped hands in 
the whipping wind at Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church, the 
gravity of the spectacle bore down on the crowd of about 8,000, and 
some winced. Just before 11 a.m., the bell began to toll and the color 
guard marched from the church. A crisp salute was offered from the 
sea of blue. One solemn piper played ``Amazing Grace'' as the casket 
was carried up the steps of the church. At the entrance to the sanctuary, 
Cavalieri's widow wept. Cavalieri was the 770th firefighter in New 
York City history to die in the line of duty. His name will be added 
to the Wall of Honor at the department's headquarters in downtown 
Brooklyn.
