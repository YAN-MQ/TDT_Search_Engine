Israel says it will not put the peace process with the Palestinians 
on hold during the election campaign. Yesterday, the Israeli parliament 
approved a draft law needed to organize early elections. Hanan Ashrawi 
is a member of the Palestinian parliament. She says the peace process 
is paralyzed. Well, I believe the peace process, once again, is being 
held hostage to Israeli domestic politics. So far, it's been in trouble, 
in constant crisis, and I believe that there will be no implementation 
and the peace process is not only suspended but is in serious trouble. 
Hanan Ashrawi. Meanwhile, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart says 
he is confident the Wye River accord will be honored.
