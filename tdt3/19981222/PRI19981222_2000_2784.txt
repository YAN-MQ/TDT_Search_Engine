If you love our daily geography quizzes or if they drive you to distraction, 
let us know. We'd like to hear your comments about the show and about 
the news in it. You can call us at 868-5750. Once again, 868-5750. 
You can also reach us in cyberspace. Our e-mail address is theworld 
-- that's one word -- theworld@pri.org. Once again, theworld@pri.org. 
Or you can put pen to paper and write us a letter at THE WORLD, 125 
Western Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02134. The address again is 
THE WORLD, 125 Western Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02134. Still 
ahead on THE WORLD, panic in Cambodia and music from Madagascar on 
PRI.
