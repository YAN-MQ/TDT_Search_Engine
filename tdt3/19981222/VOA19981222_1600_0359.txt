Russia's lower house of Parliament has postponed debate on the nuclear 
arms reduction Treaty known as Stark II. However, the deputy Speaker 
of Parliament, told reporters in Moscow Tuesday, that Stark II will 
be on the agenda for the DUMA's first session early next year. Eve 
Conant brings us up to date from Moscow. Lawmakers in Russia's Communist-led 
lower House of Parliament said, last week, Stark II might never be 
ratified. This was in response to the U.S. led attack on Iraq, which 
dealt a blow to Russia's political prestige and was vehemently denounced 
across Russia's political spectrum. But this week, Russia's law makers 
seem to be softening. Speaker of the parliament, Vladimere Dreshcove, 
told Russian news agencies, Stark II will be on the agenda for parliament's 
first session in early 1999. But, Mr. Dreschove emphasized, in his 
words, "Ratification is not guaranteed, nor is it certain parliament 
will even consider Stark II." Mr. Dreschove supports the treaty, but 
says many have what he calls a "sharply negative attitude" towards 
last week's military strikes. He said any optimism would be premature. 
Communists in Parliament have consistently opposed the 1993 treaty 
and have been stalling ratification for years. They say Stark II, 
which would reduce both the Russian and the U.S. nuclear arsenal by 
half, would weaken Russia's security, and it's too expensive. President 
Yeltsin, and his administration, have supported Stark II as a way 
to trim and modernize Russia's military forces. Earlier this month, 
a visiting U.S. delegation expressed hope Russia might ratify the 
accord before the end of this year. Eve Conant for VOA News, Moscow.
