Another prominent Chinese dissident has been given a lengthy prison 
sentence for subversion -- the third activist to receive such punishment 
in two days. A court in the central city of Woohans sentenced Chin 
Young Min to 12 years in prison. He was convicted of trying to overthrow 
the government in connection with his efforts to organize the opposition 
China Democracy Party. Two other dissidents convicted on the same 
charges, Shoo Win Lee and Wong Yo Chiai, received prison sentences 
of 13 years and 11 years, respectively, on Monday. A U.S. State Department 
spokesman here in Washington called for the release of the men, saying 
they were punished only for taking part in a new political party. 
The International Human Rights Group, Human Rights Watch, has also 
condemned the sentences.
