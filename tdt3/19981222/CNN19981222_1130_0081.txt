CNN has learned four moderate republicans in the house who voted for 
impeachment are sending a letter to Senate majority leader Trent Lott 
asking him to allow the Senate to consider strong censure. The letter 
states -- I'm disturbed that they didn't say that before they voted 
in the house. That seems to me it would have been a more timely place 
and time to make that point. I'm glad they finally said it if that's 
what they believe, but I sure wish they would have said that to their 
colleagues and to themselves, prior to the vote in the house.
