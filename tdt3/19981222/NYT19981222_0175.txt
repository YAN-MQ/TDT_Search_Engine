It was the early 1980s, a time before Lounge, and the martini looked 
to be on its last legs. Undeterred, a martini lover and classics professor 
named Lowell Edmunds wrote a treatise on his favorite drink, exploring 
its multiple meanings, explaining its ambiguous messages and tracing 
its intricate history. His book, ``The Silver Bullet,'' was a landmark, 
the first serious work on America's greatest cocktail, but for years 
_ the very years in which the martini has regained its former glory 
_ it has been out of print. Now, revised and updated, Edmunds's labor 
of love lives again, outfitted with a new title, ``Martini, Straight 
Up: The Classic American Cocktail'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 
$24.95). As before, Edmunds puts the martini on the cultural couch, 
teasing out its contradictions. Drawing on Hollywood movies, novels 
and journalism to illustrate his points, he looks deep into the famous 
conical glass and sees seven messages (the martini is urban and urbane, 
for example, not rural or rustic) and four ambiguities (the drink 
is both sensitive and tough) concealed within. ``Its pleasure, which 
is not voluptuous but astringent,'' he writes, ``can only be expressed 
by oxymoron: sensuous coldness, opulent dryness, mysterious clarity, 
alluring purity.'' Edmunds seems to have unearthed every reference 
to the martini since its creation sometime in the 1870s, and by researching 
recipe books from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, he has painstakingly 
reconstructed the actual history of a cocktail swaddled in myth. He 
tracked down the first shipment of French vermouth to the United States 
(from Noilly Prat, in 1851). He got the lowdown on Sherwood Anderson's 
unfortunate death-by-toothpick after drinking a martini. He compiled 
a list of every martini cartoon ever to appear in The New Yorker. 
The martini is the last word on cocktails. This book is the last word 
on the martini.
