A former Ukrainian prime minister charged Tuesday that a Swiss money 
laundering investigation against him was inspired by Ukrainian leaders 
who want to neutralize him before 1999 presidential elections. Pavlo 
Lazarenko said his recent arrest in Switzerland was the work of Ukrainian 
prosecutors who persuaded their Swiss colleagues to investigate and 
detain him. ``I have not committed a single violation of Swiss law,'' 
Lazarenko told a news conference. ``But this case revealed the real 
aim of Ukrainian authorities: Lazarenko gets arrested in Switzerland 
and the (Ukrainian) authorities then say they have nothing to do with 
the arrest.'' Lazarenko was released last week on dlrs 3 million bail 
from a jail in Switzerland following his arrest by Swiss police earlier 
this month on money laundering charges. Lazarenko, who heads his opposition 
Hromada party in parliament, has turned into an adamant opponent of 
President Leonid Kuchma and prominent opposition leader since being 
fired from the prime minister's post in July 1997. Until his arrest, 
many had expected Lazarenko to run in the October 1999 presidential 
election. If he doesn't, analysts predict he will channel his reportedly 
substantial financial resources to support another candidate opposing 
Kuchma. Lazarenko would not say Tuesday whether he would run, but 
said his party would discuss the issue at a congress this week. Ukraine's 
chief prosecutor's office has launched an investigation against Lazarenko, 
accusing him of siphoning millions of dollars out of Ukraine illegally, 
largely through the national gas distribution market. On Monday, prosecutors 
asked parliament to revoke Lazarenko's immunity so he could be arrested 
and put on trial on charges of stealing government funds and illegally 
stashing about dlrs 4 million abroad. Under Ukraine's constitution, 
a lawmaker can be prosecuted only if parliament lifts his immunity. 
It is unclear when parliament would debate the prosecutor's request. 
Lazarenko said the request was an attempt to discredit him and his 
opposition party before presidential elections. ``The Ukrainian authorities 
will be destroying Lazarenko until the end because they are not interested 
in his presence in Ukraine during the presidential elections,'' he 
said. Lazarenko said he was ready to provide evidence of corruption 
and money laundering against several senior government officials, 
but said he would not give it to Ukrainian prosecutors. ``Unbiased 
people are needed to prove facts of corruption in Ukraine,'' Lazarenko 
said. Lazarenko did not say who he would give the evidence to or when. 
But he warned: ``Lazarenko is not an angel, and I'm saying that honestly. 
The acts (that were employed against me) cannot be forgiven.'' Later 
Tuesday, Kuchma called Lazarenko's claims ungrounded. ``If (Lazarenko) 
had anything to say (about corruption), he would have said it a dozen 
times,'' Kuchma said, according to the Interfax news agency.
