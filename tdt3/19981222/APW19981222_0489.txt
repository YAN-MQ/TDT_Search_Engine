At least two men were killed and more than 15 others were wounded 
Tuesday in clashes between heavily armed militiamen loyal to South 
Mogadishu warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid, witnesses said. One group 
was connected with the Suleman sub-clan; the other with an Islamic 
court in the southern half of the war-torn capital. The fighting was 
said to be connected to disputes over land ownership. The witnesses 
said fighting began when a a group of militiamen tried to kidnap another 
man, and militiamen from the Shirkole Islamic court intervened. Although 
three of the court's militiamen were wounded, the group managed to 
restore calm to the area. One of the would-be kidnappers as well as 
second unidentified man were killed. Officials from the Islamic court 
said they would soon take up the longstanding land dispute which civilian 
courts were never able to resolve. There has been no central government 
or administration in Somalia since Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohamed 
Farah Aidid, and north Mogadishu warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed briefly 
joined forces to oust longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, 
plunging the country into civil war. Islamic courts have been established 
in Mogadishu and other parts of the country in a attempt to curb violence 
and settle civil disputes.
