A popular toy basketball set is being recalled for safety concerns. 
Ed Garsten reports on the problem and how it's being fixed. Kids, 
especially little ones, love the feeling of trying to make that first 
basket. And a variety of toymakers sell pint-sized sets to help junior 
jordans get started. But the consumer product safety commission has 
found that many sets made between 1976 and early this year can be 
dangerous, and deadly. And it's recalling 10.1 million of them. The 
problem is, is that children can strangle in the nets of these sets. 
And there have been 20 incidents, which included one death. The commission 
says that either the nets are separating from the rim, or the knots 
are sliding. And when there's an opening, a child's head can get caught 
in it, and the net can get twisted around the child's neck. The recalled 
sets were made by Ohio art, little tikes, today's kids, and Fisher-price. 
If you own a basketball set, contact the company to see if your model 
number is one being recalled. If so, you can order a replacement net 
at no charge. While you're waiting for it, you can just keep the Rim, 
take off the old net, cut it up, throw it away. And that way, budding 
Larry birds can safely sink 'em. Ed Garsten, CNN, Detroit.
