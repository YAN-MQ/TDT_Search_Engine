It is time now for a look at sports. And the Miami Dolphins are going 
to the National Football League Playoffs, thank you. The Dolphins 
will be joining three other AFC Eastern Division teams in the playoffs 
after beating the once-invincible Denver Broncos. Dan Marino threw 
four touchdowns Monday night as the Dolphins handed the Broncos a 
31-21 shellacking. The loss was Denver's second in a row after 13 
straight wins.
