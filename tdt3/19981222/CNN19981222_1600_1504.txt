This Christmas, a familiar voice in the rock music world is plying 
his trade on a different stage -- Broadway. Bill Tush reports. I say 
-- Who is that under the stocking cap and grey wig playing ebenezer 
scrooge? Actually, it's the lead singer of the who, Roger daltrey, 
up there on stage. This marks the rock legend's New York acting debut. 
I've never done a theatrical stage thing ever, and this is it. So 
where better -- where better to spend Christmas if you're not going 
to be at home, than a city like New York? So through December 27th, 
daltrey dons the scrooge costume and goes out there 15 times a week. 
A grueling schedule indeed, even for a veteran rocker. It's challenging, 
but I don't think it's any harder than rock 'N' roll. The hardest 
thing about this part is that I'm playing a man at about 70, and his 
body posture is appalling. While his starring in "A Christmas Carol" 
may be daltrey's New York stage debut, it is by no means his first 
acting gig. In fact, he grabbed a golden globe nomination for his 
performance in the film version of the who's rock opera "Tommy." Most 
of the people who are coming to see him as scrooge, though, weren't 
even born back in 19 5, when daltrey played Tommy. I'd say maybe 80% 
of the audience, they don't know you from the who. Thank God! Thank 
God. No, they just know me as this mean old fellow that comes out 
and shouts at kids. Go by the touch a toy, buy lots have a good and 
fine go well So what, they don't know him from who. The thrill on 
this one is playing to these, the very young audiences. It's the most 
wonderful experience. Because any 11:00 in the morning show is not 
an easy order to fill. But when we come onstage and we're standing 
back there and you hear all these kids in the crowd getting ready 
for a show, and the lights go out and they scream, it's worth a million 
bucks a week. It's the best feeling. And you just want -- you just 
become a kid again. God bless us, everyone. Bill Tush, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
