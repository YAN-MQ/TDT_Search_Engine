President Clinton's job approval rating has gone up, even as he faces 
the prospect of a Senate trial in the Monica Lewinskey scandal that 
could lead to his removal from office. Seventy-three percent of those 
surveyed by the New York Times and CBS News said that they approve 
of the way Mr. Clinton is doing his job. He enjoyed similar marks 
in several other polls. The Republicans' popularity rating was around 
35 percent. And the Republican-led House voted Saturday to impeach 
Mr. Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice.
