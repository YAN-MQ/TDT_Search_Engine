United States and Britain have dismissed an Iraqi report that western 
warplanes fired two missiles on the Masseraey area on Tuesday. U.S. 
defense officials had no U.S. aircraft fired rockets over Iraq, Tuesday. 
The British Air Force said none of its planes were flying over Southern 
Iraq. The report was Iraq's first claim of a military incident since 
the U.S. and Britain halted four nights of air strikes, early on Sunday.
