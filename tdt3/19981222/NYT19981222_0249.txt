In his spare time, Dhia al-Quasi still likes to recall the night in 
1986 when an audience of actors, directors and theater professors 
from around the world greeted his production of ``King Lear'' with 
a rapturous standing ovation. These days, however, Quasi doesn't have 
much spare time. He rises early for his first class at the Academy 
of Fine Arts here, teaches until midafternoon, grabs a quick lunch 
and then begins his work as a taxi driver. Without his taxi income, 
he said, he could not support his family. ``Once we had fulfilling 
lives, but now we have dropped out of the world,'' he mused after 
his last class today. ``Everything has changed, and we really don't 
understand why. All we can do is accept it. There is no alternative.'' 
Until 1990, when President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait turned 
this country into an international pariah, Iraqis were known as some 
of the most sophisticated people in the Middle East. Students from 
across the Arab world flocked to universities here, and cultural figures 
like Quasi attracted large and enthusiastic followings. But eight 
years of crushing economic sanctions have turned that Iraq into a 
distant memory. Thousands of educated Iraqis have fled in search of 
normality abroad. The most resilient remain, but like King Lear himself, 
they cannot quite comprehend how they lost so much that was so good. 
The U.S. and British governments have a simple explanation. They say 
that Saddam has built a terrifying arsenal of chemical and biological 
weapons, and that foreign powers have no choice but to limit him in 
any way possible, even if it means imposing sanctions and dropping 
bombs. Because the political climate here does not permit dissent, 
it is hard to gauge what Iraqis really think. But in conversations 
after last week's bombing campaign, several sophisticated professionals 
said they blame the United States for destroying their way of life 
and shredding the prospects of an entire generation. ``I am educated, 
I know what's happening, and still I blame the United States and Clinton,'' 
said Yania Attala, a retired schoolteacher with a degree in literature. 
``If they want to penalize someone, let them do it, but not the Iraqi 
people. Doesn't Israel have a nuclear bomb? Doesn't India? Every country 
needs weapons to defend itself. We could be attacked by Iran at any 
moment. Why single us out and bomb us?'' ``I used to live very well,'' 
Ms. Attala continued. ``I traveled, I bought whatever I wanted and 
was quite prosperous. Now I am reduced to a kind of poverty. Last 
week I spent four days at home not knowing if I was going to be hit 
by a bomb. We gave my mother Valium to calm her down, but they didn't 
help. So how do you think I feel? How would you feel?'' U.N. aid programs 
have eased the most acute suffering here, but levels of health, nutrition 
and education are still nowhere near what they were a decade ago. 
After the bombing and Iraq's subsequent announcement that it will 
no longer permit monitoring of its weapons program, a solution seems 
further off than ever. In a small office above a busy Baghdad street, 
Dr. Ahmed Mahbobu, a pediatrician educated in Glasgow, treats more 
people in a day than he used to in a week, he said. Most are unable 
to pay and cannot afford to fill the prescriptions he writes. He cannot 
even treat his own advancing case of Parkinson's disease because the 
medicine he needs is not available here. ``The most common problem 
I see is underweight and malnourished fetuses,'' he said as he tried 
to control the palsy in his right arm. ``Mothers don't get enough 
to eat, so their children are permanently damaged and will not develop 
normally, either physically or psychologically. Our rate of children 
born underweight used to be under .01 percent. Now it's over 10 percent.'' 
Because of his reputation, Mahbobu counts some of Baghdad's wealthiest 
mothers-to-be among his patients. Without the fees they pay, he could 
not survive. ``I don't really know how they get their money, but they 
certainly seem to get it,'' he said. ``They're in some sort of business, 
I guess. Of course people resent it, but that is what life has become 
here.'' In Iraq, as in Serbia and other places where economic sanctions 
have been imposed, opportunities open up for wheeler-dealers. Sanctions 
have turned this country into a sea of poverty, but sanctions-busting 
has created verdant islands of wealth. Most Iraqis who live the life 
of the mind are swimming in the dark sea as the islands recede ever 
farther into the distance. They seek refuge in their intellects and 
emotions. ``I wish I could afford good paints again, but other than 
that, I don't think about the embargo,'' said Hamid al-Mahal, one 
of Iraq's most prominent artists, who studied in Paris. ``My painting 
has nothing to do with politics, and neither do I,'' Mahal said. ``Of 
course I want the embargo to end soon, even today if that is possible. 
But I keep telling myself that even an embargo cannot stifle art and 
creativity. I have to believe that, or else everything is lost.''
