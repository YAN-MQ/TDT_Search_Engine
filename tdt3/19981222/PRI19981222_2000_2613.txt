The Japanese may be having a merry Christmas, but what about you? 
Is it a time of joy and peace or of stress and strain? THE WORLD's 
Boris Maximov shares some seasonal thoughts. Everywhere I go, everywhere 
I look, people keep complaining about Christmas -- all the hassle, 
all the shopping, procuring of gifts, stocking up on food, writing 
cards, watching the bank account dwindle, all the strain on the family, 
all the guilt, not to mention the trips to 15 stores to get the tree 
here, the only ones there, something special for the grandmas, somewhere 
else altogether, balancing your time with the family. Work and life 
is bad enough without all this stress. And to make your mood even 
worse, every store you enter is playing the same holiday Christmas 
cheer. In the words of Lenin, "What is to be done?" Well, let me tell 
you a story. Once upon a time, long ago and far away, somewhere in 
Eastern Europe, a man came to his rabbi. "Rabbi, help," he pleaded. 
"Me and my wife, my 10 children, my mother-in-law are all living in 
one room where I have my tailor shop as well. We're on top of each 
other. The noise, the hassle -- I cannot take it anymore. What, oh, 
what shall I do?" The rabbi stroked his long beard and said to the 
unfortunate man, "Buy yourself a goat." A month later, the same man 
comes again complaining even more about the same utterly intolerable 
terrible conditions, and on top of that, there is a stinking goat. 
The rabbi stroked his beard and said to the unfortunate man, "Sell 
the goat." A little while later, the man went to see the rabbi, beaming 
his pleasure. He said, "You were right, Rabbi. Without that goat, 
life is so much better." And the moral of the story? Think of the 
pre-Christmas hassle, bustle, endless shopping, family quarrels, and 
the sheer imposition of it all as just another goat. Soon, things 
will return to normal. You will have survived yet another period of 
madness. Without that goat, life will be so much better. Merry Christmas. 
THE WORLD's Boris Maximov never gets our goat. He's a regular contributor 
to the world.
