Israel's parliament has voted overwhelmingly for early elections after 
rejecting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's tough policies for making 
peace with the Palestinians. In Jerusalem is VOA's David Golles with 
this report. Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud Party decided to join in 
the move for elections after it became clear the prime minister's 
right-leaning coalition stood to lose a confidence vote in parliament. 
The left-of-center Labor Party accuses Mr. Netanyahu of wrecking the 
peace process with the Palestinians by pandering to far-right parties. 
In a blistering speech, Labor leader Abhood Barock, heard here through 
an interpreter, said the government had lost all principles. It's 
a systematic capitulation to the extremists in order to survive. This 
is a government which cannot and does not wish to work for the sake 
of the whole of the Israeli people. Mr. Barock turned down a last-minute 
appeal from the prime minister to join in a national unity government.
