Finns have indulged their famed infatuation with technology so deeply 
that there are now more cellular phones than regular telephone subscriptions 
in the country, according to government figures released Tuesday. 
The Ministry of Transport and Communications said 56 out every 100 
people in the country own cellular phones, and more are buying every 
day. An estimated 60,000 new subscribers come every month, the ministry 
said. ``In 1997, we made a cautious prediction to cross 50 percent 
coverage by the year 2000 - but it happened in August this year. The 
growth has been incredibly strong,'' said Mikael Akermarck, a researcher 
at the ministry. The ministry now predicts that 60 out of 100 will 
have cellular phones by next spring. The growth in fixed phone line 
subscriptions has leveled off completely and many households now own 
several mobile phones, he added. Mobile phone maker Nokia, which claims 
to be the world's largest, is based in Finland.
