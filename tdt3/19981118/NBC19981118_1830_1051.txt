Up next -- "bitter pill," our special series on the high cost of prescription 
drugs. And have you checked your phone Bill lately? Sneaky charges 
could wind up on your Bill. It's a "fleecing of America." Some things 
can never be taught... in a Classroom. You won't find them in any 
textbook. And with fixodent's long-lasting hold... you'll be ready 
no matter where the lesson takes you. For long-lasting hold... okay! 
and stretch! And bend! And stretch! And bend! Unlike ordinary pickles, 
claussen just won't bend... come on, everybody! stretch! And bend! 
When it comes to taste. - We make 'em cold and keep 'em cold. - so 
enjoy the cold snap of claussen. Dog, thinking: T-bone! T-bone! Looking 
for a T-bone! Chewy, meaty T-bone! At the big T-bone store! There's 
one! No, that's not one. Over there! no! no! On that shelf! ahh! Too 
green! Wait a minute! There! A whole package of little chewy, meaty 
T-bone steaks! Ya-hoo! I'm waking up! Mama brought you some T bonz 
dog snacks. Made with real meat, so dogs think... Dog: it's a T-bone! 
Resealable T bonz brand from Purina. It's a T-bone!
