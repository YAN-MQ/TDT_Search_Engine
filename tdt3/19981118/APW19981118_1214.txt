SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) - Two senior NATO officials arrived in Macedonia 
Wednesday as the country prepared to formally allow the deployment 
of NATO's rapid reaction force to assist international monitors in 
neighboring Kosovo. U.S. Admiral James O. Ellis, commander-in-chief 
of NATO's Allied Forces Southern Europe, and French Gen. Marcel Valentin 
met Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov and the likely future premier, 
Ljubco Georgievski. Macedonia's outgoing government said Wednesday 
it could not give a formal go-ahead for the NATO deployment on its 
territory before the country's new government is formed. Incumbent 
ex-Communists lost last month's elections to a conservative center-right 
coalition. But sources close to Georgievski said his new government, 
to be formed by the end of this month, will invite a French-commanded 
extraction force designed to rescue any of some 2,000 unarmed verifiers 
if they come under threat in Kosovo, a Serbian province in neighboring 
Yugoslavia. In Lisbon, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander 
in Europe, warned Wednesday that diplomatic efforts to secure a lasting 
settlement in Kosovo must advance quickly because the cease-fire there 
is shaky and could collapse within months. ``Despite all our best 
efforts ... we probably have only a two-to-four month window of relative 
peace,'' Clark told a conference here. ``We must use this respite 
to achieve a just and durable political settlement'' in the southern 
Serb province. On Tuesday, NATO formally requested Macedonia's permission 
to deploy the force - about 1,800 soldiers with tanks and helicopters 
- on its territory. President Gligorov said in a statement Wednesday 
that he received NATO Secretary General Javier Solana's request for 
the deployment, adding he supports such a move because of the ``humanitarian 
aspect of the mission'' and Macedonia's ``strategic plans toward NATO.'' 
Last Sunday, Yugoslavia lodged an ``energetic protest'' to Macedonia, 
warning that Macedonia's consent to serve as a base for ``any military 
action against Yugoslavia would be contrary to long-term interests 
of the two countries'' and their good relations. On Wednesday, Macedonia 
handed a counter-protest to Yugoslavia, saying the deployment of foreign 
troops is the country's internal matter. As part of a U.S.-brokered 
deal struck Oct. 12, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic allowed 
the civilian verifiers to be sent to Kosovo. They are to ensure Milosevic 
abides by the agreement and NATO's rapid reaction force is intended 
to rescue the verifiers in case of trouble. Macedonia was the only 
former Yugoslavia republic which seceded without bloodshed from the 
six-republic federation in 1991.
