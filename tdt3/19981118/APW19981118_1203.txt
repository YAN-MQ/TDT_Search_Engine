Already under a political death sentence in its present form, Britain's 
unelected House of Lords has repeatedly blocked a bill to change the 
voting system for European Parliament elections in what the Labor 
Party government calls ``an abuse of power.'' By a vote of 212-183, 
the Lords rejected the bill for the fifth straight time Wednesday 
in an unprecedented show of defiance that Prime Minister Tony Blair 
blames on hereditary peers _ aristocrats who overwhelmingly support 
the opposition Conservative Party. The government said will make no 
further attempt to have it passed before the current parliamentary 
session ends on Thursday, effectively killing off the bill. In angry 
exchanges in the House of Commons before the Lords' vote, Blair taunted 
Conservative leader William Hague with ``wrapping himself in the ermine 
of hereditary peers.'' ``This is no longer about the (voting) system, 
it's about the hereditary Tory peers in the House of Lords,'' Blair 
said, shouting above jeers from Conservative lawmakers. Hague, referring 
to Blair's plan to turn the Lords into an all-appointed chamber, charged 
him with seeking to ``expand the power of your own clique of cronies 
at the expense of the power of the people.'' The latest defeat will 
be used by Labor as a major argument for its plan to abolish the 600-year-old 
right of hereditary peers to vote in the Lords. On Tuesday, the Lords 
rejected the bill by a 261-198 vote. Queen Elizabeth II is due to 
open the new session of Parliament on Tuesday by reading out the legislative 
program for the coming year _ likely to include a bill to strip the 
hereditary peers of voting rights. The government can get a measure 
rejected by the Lords passed automatically in the next session of 
Parliament. But reintroducing the bill in the new session would be 
too late to set up the voting system _ which critics say gives too 
much power to party machines _ for European Parliament elections in 
July. The new system, involving constituency boundary changes, could 
not then be in place until 2004 elections. Conservative opponents, 
both lifetime and hereditary peers, are supported by dozens of peers 
with no party affiliation, some Labor rebels, and senior Church of 
England bishops who have seats in the upper chamber. But Blair's aides 
said that without the votes of Tory hereditary peers, the measure 
would have passed by 36 votes on Tuesday. The bill provides that instead 
of voting for a single candidate in each district, voters choose a 
party. The party would then allocate seats to its nominees, with the 
number of seats based on the proportion of the overall vote won by 
each party. The system is used France, Germany, Greece, Spain and 
Portugal. But British opponents say the measure deprives voters of 
the right to choose a candidate and allows party apparatchiks to control 
who gets elected.
