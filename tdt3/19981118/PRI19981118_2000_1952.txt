The State Department has intervened in a deepening controversy between 
Italy and Turkey. It's calling upon Italy to hand over Kurdish Separatist 
leader, Abdullah Audulan. He was detained there last week. Turkey 
wants to put Audulan on trial, saying he is a terrorist responsible 
for thousands of Turkish deaths. But Italy is refusing to extradite 
him, because Turkey, unlike Italy retains the death penalty.
