Actress Esther rolle is dead at the age of 78. Many remember her as 
the feisty maid on the TV comedy "maude" and as the strong-willed 
matriarch on the series "good times." Rolle also had major movie and 
stage credits, including "driving miss daisy," and "A raisin in the 
sun." While she often played the parts of maids and housekeepers, 
she fought black stereotypes in Hollywood. She has a role in the film 
"down in the Delta," which is due out next month. Her publicist says 
rolle died overnight after a long illness.
