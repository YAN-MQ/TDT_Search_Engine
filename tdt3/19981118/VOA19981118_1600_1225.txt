The top-ranked Duke Blue Devils got off to an easy start Tuesday night, 
while reigning champion Kentucky cruised to a win over eastern Kentucky 
in college basketball. Tragon Langden scored 27 points for Duke, as 
the Blue Devils rolled to a 94-61 win over Davidson. Langden says 
after a sloppy start, the Devils were able to recover themselves a 
win. I got Roland early, Bennison did a good job coming off the bat. 
Fresh enough from the half court. They did not let us get into our 
stuff. We turned the ball over early and I just, you know, made a 
concerted effort to come down and try to get some good shots. Get 
our offense going and get some shots from the guys did a good job 
screening for me and looking for me a lot of thanks to them.
