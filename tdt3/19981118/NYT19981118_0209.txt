When it comes to homework assignments, the goal in my household is 
to avoid, at all costs, the diorama. I recognize the value of the 
dreaded diorama as a fallback option for families who avoid confronting 
until the very last minute the looming deadline of a fourth-grade 
social studies project. That said, everything else about the diorama 
experience _ the tense search for an empty shoe box, the furtive attempt 
to remove its price tag before someone asks whether $100 wasn't a 
lot of money to spend on lug-sole loafers, the bickering over who 
used up all the glue and brown construction paper _ is bleak. The 
best you can hope for is that after your child assembles a phony three-dimensional 
scene using Popsicle sticks that plausibly depicts, say, the discovery 
of fire, the project will survive the bus ride to school _ but not 
the bus ride home. To avoid this vicious cycle, my 9-year-old daughter 
and I went to the public library the other day to research Algonquin 
crafts. But then we saw a sign taped to the front door. ``Closed for 
renovation,'' Zoe read darkly. ``I am going to fail fourth grade.'' 
My mood matched hers; by the time the library reopened, we would already 
be enmeshed in a diorama situation. Unless, of course, our home computer 
could save us. In second grade, the machine had proved an adequate 
tool for supplementary research, enabling Zoe to snag information 
about the history of copper off an obscure Web site. But this would 
be a task of a much broader scope. At home a half-hour later, it seemed 
prudent to start slowly. Why confront the Internet at all if we didn't 
need to? Had we been at the public library, Zoe's first step would 
have been to look up ``Algonquin'' in an encyclopedia. So I handed 
her the CD-ROM for the Encarta encyclopedia. After the opening screen 
appeared, Zoe intuitively clicked on Find. Then I pointed out the 
on-screen query box (participating far more than I would have had 
to at the library, by the way, where I could have skulked in a corner 
reading back issues of my favorite magazines). She typed ``Algonquin'' 
in the search box, selected the first of four matches that appeared, 
then read aloud. ``Native North American tribe of the Algonquian lin-something 
stock, dwelling originally in the vin ... city of the Ga ... What 
is that word, Gadzo River?'' Frustrated, she looked up. ``I don't 
think this has anything that will help me.'' I looked over her shoulder. 
``That's linguistic, vicinity and Gatineau River,''' I said. If she 
had been wrong on pronunciation, Zoe had been right on the bigger 
issue. Despite its multimedia format and links to related articles 
and maps, Encarta gave us the same general kind of information as 
an old-fashioned paper encyclopedia. One difference: a book would 
not have forced us to reboot; Encarta crashed the computer when I 
inserted its second disk. At the library, the next step would have 
been to find a reference librarian. So we logged on to America Online, 
then connected to its Ask a Teacher feature (keyword: homework). Zoe 
typed a query to one of AOL's social studies specialists: ``How can 
I learn about Algonquin crafts?'' An on-screen message informed us 
that ``teachers will read your e-mail and attempt to provide an answer 
by e-mail.'' (Three days later, we were still waiting.) In the meantime, 
we tried AOL's other features. We searched its articles database (keyword: 
elibrary) but got only irrelevant responses, like a list of sleep-away 
summer camps in Minnesota. Then we tried the social studies tutoring 
room on the Kids Only channel (click on Homework Help, then Discuss 
It). The tutoring room was closed, although, according to the posted 
hours, it should have been open. Trying not to lose heart, we decided 
to conduct rudimentary Web searches on www.hotbot.com and www.yahoo.com. 
Although her query _ ``Algonquin crafts'' _ returned screens of responses, 
none of the first 20 on either site seemed useful (after 20, we gave 
up). After nearly two uproductive hours, the Internet seemed like 
just another form of diorama, a vast collection of useless facts that 
is a simulacrum of real knowledge. But since I don't want my daughter 
to think it is OK to be defeated by adversity _ or technical perversity 
_ as a last resort we queried a children's search engine, Ask Jeeves 
for Kids (www.ajkids.com). Zoe clicked on a response and the screen 
filled with gold. At www.civilization.ca/membrs/fph/stones/engfrm.htm, 
we found descriptions of American Indian musical instruments, toys, 
crafts, articles of clothing. Zoe decided to build a version of a 
cradleboard that had once carried an Algonquin child's doll. So what 
was the biggest difference between old-fashioned library research 
and computer research? The odds. At the library, we would have found 
information in some children's reference book or another. It might 
not have been exhilarating, but it would have been adequate. Using 
the computer, however, was an all-or-nothing experience. This time, 
it paid off. ``We never could have found this list at the library,'' 
Zoe said. That was the good news. The bad news? To make the cradleboard, 
we needed a shoe box. Mail address: Slatalla(AT)nytimes.com
