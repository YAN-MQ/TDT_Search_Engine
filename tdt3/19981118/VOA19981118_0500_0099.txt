Israel's parliament has overwhelmingly approved the new Israeli Palestinian 
peace accord signed last month in Washington. This moves the deal 
closer to implementation. After two days of heated debate, the canasit 
voted to ratify the agreement, which calls for Israel to turn over 
control of 13 percent more West Bank territory. The Israeli cabinet 
is expected to meet Thursday to review Palestinian compliance and 
decide whether to begin a phased withdrawal.
