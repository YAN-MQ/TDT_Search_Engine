Grain and soybean futures rose sharply Wednesday on the Chicago Board 
of Trade amid hopes for new export business. The U.S. Agriculture 
Department indicated Tuesday that it likely will buy more grain for 
donation to needy countries than the 2.5 million metric tons estimated 
earlier as it tries to help farmers get rid of bumper crops. Corn 
and wheat also were supported by bad weather in Australia and Argentina, 
which raised the potential for sharply reduced production there. Soybean 
futures rose amid expectation for a increase in soybean oil exports 
as the price of a competing vegetable oil, palm oil, moves higher. 
Increased exports would come at a time of weaker soybean oil processing. 
Wheat for December delivery rose 5 cents to dlrs 2.93 a bushel; December 
corn rose 2 1-4 cents to dlrs 2.21 1-4 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at dlrs 1.11 a bushel; January soybeans rose 2 1-2 cents 
to dlrs 5.84 a bushel; while the expiring November contract rose 6 
1-4 cents to dlrs 5.79 a bushel.
