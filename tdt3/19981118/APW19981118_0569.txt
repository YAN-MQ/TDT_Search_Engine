Ukrainian police have detained two armed soldiers who fled from their 
military unit last week after stealing weapons and ammunition, newspapers 
said Wednesday. Oleh Korniyenko and Roman Bebeshko were detained on 
a highway 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the northeastern city of Sumy, 
where their military garrison is based, the daily Den said. The 19-year-old 
conscripts deserted their unit on Nov. 8 with two Kalashnikov rifles, 
two bayonets and four empty magazines. They face up to five years 
in prison if convicted. They told investigators they wanted to earn 
money from selling the stolen weapons and ammunition and then become 
mercenaries, the daily Fakty reported. Cases of conscripts fleeing 
from the Ukrainian armed forces, like those in neighboring Russia 
and other former Soviet republics, have become common recently. Last 
week, a 19-year-old soldier deserted his garrison in the eastern city 
of Poltava and shot himself to death several hours later after he 
was surrounded by fellow soldiers pursuing him. The Ukrainian army, 
hit by the country's continuing economic decline, suffers from poor 
living conditions, chronic shortages of funds and supplies, and brutal 
hazings inflicted on young conscripts by older soldiers.
