The Palestinian Authority has announced moves aimed at getting the 
Israeli cabinet to approve the first handover of land to Yasir Arafat 
when it meets tomorrow. Steve McNally reports from Jerusalem. Yasir 
Arafat will issue decrees on Friday and Saturday ordering the seizure 
of illegal weapons and banning violent incitement against Jews. Both 
are crucial to getting the Israeli Cabinet to OK the first troop withdrawals 
from the West Bank this week or next. The cabinet is bitterly divided 
over the peace plan. And Benjamin Netanyahu put off the meeting until 
tomorrow waiting for today's announcement from the Palestinians. The 
two sides are still at odds over the names of Palestinian prisoners 
to be released from Israeli jails. But there was one bit of progress 
today. Foreign Minister Arial Sharron met with Palestinian negotiator 
Mafmoud Abaz to open the final status talks. They began discussing 
thorny questions about the future of Jerusalem which both sides claim, 
and the final borders between Israel and a new Palestinian state. 
For NPR News, this is Steve McNally in Jerusalem.
