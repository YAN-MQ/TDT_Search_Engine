Early Monday morning, hours after his team's 37-3 loss to the Green 
Bay Packers, New York Giants coach Jim Fassel examined the tape of 
the game in his office, staring soberly at the image of quarterback 
Danny Kanell. He knew Kanell had not played well, but he was looking 
for signs that Kanell was still seeing the field properly, still thinking, 
still in control. Fassel never found what he had hoped to see. ``Something 
is wrong,'' he said. Most telling was one play the Giants had practiced 
repeatedly the week before _ a pass on the goal line. It was executed 
entirely wrong, with Kanell looking away from a wide-open receiver 
and toward one in double coverage. In that moment and in others the 
next two days, Fassel came to his decision to pull the plug _ temporarily 
at least _ on the 20-game Danny Kanell era. He had seen enough to 
believe that Kanell was mentally overwrought. Wednesday, it was Kanell's 
backup, Kent Graham, taking the snaps with the first-string offense 
as the Giants prepared for Sunday's home game against the Philadelphia 
Eagles. Kanell waited behind the starting unit, helmet in hand. ``I'm 
giving Danny a timeout,'' Fassel said of Kanell, whose two-year record 
as the Giants' starter is 10-9-1. ``Danny has a future and I'm not 
putting him on the shelf and forgetting him. But something's wrong. 
It's hard for me to believe he hasn't lost some of his confidence. 
It's never an easy thing to do when it involves a young quarterback, 
but as a coach you have to make a decision. ``How much more confidence 
can he lose? How much more shattered can he get? I think he needs 
to regroup to collect his thoughts, and I need to win this game right 
now. I need a spark.'' Although Fassel said he had no timetable for 
how long Graham would play over the remainder of the season, he made 
it relatively clear that Graham was not embarking on a one-game tryout. 
``Kent does not need to look over his shoulder after a bad series, 
bad pass or bad game,'' Fassel said of Graham, whom he coached as 
an assistant with the Giants in 1992 and the Arizona Cardinals in 
1996. ``I have a lot of confidence in Kent.'' Left unsaid was how 
Kanell, who will be 25 next week, or Graham, who is 30, figure in 
the plans of the team. Based on comments made by people within the 
organization during the past year, Graham has never been viewed as 
someone the team would build around. The Giants could draft a quarterback 
next spring or sign a veteran who becomes a free agent this winter, 
or Kanell could regain his starting job in three weeks and restore 
the franchise's faith in him. What happens if Graham is productive 
and the Giants play better is less clear, although he could be the 
starter who shepherds the offense while the Giants nurture a quarterback 
drafted in the first round next spring. Then there is Mike Cherry, 
the third-string quarterback with the best throwing arm on the team. 
Fassel said he would use him in the fourth quarter of remaining games 
in which the Giants lead or trail by a significant number of points. 
Fassel, like others in the organization, wants to see Cherry, a sixth-round 
draft pick last year, in action. Cherry has been in for just a few 
plays in two years. Kanell and Graham were both low-key in their public 
reactions to Fassel's decision Wednesday, although Kanell looked unhappy 
and Graham looked rejuvenated. ``I probably disagree with this,'' 
said Kanell, who has thrown for 11 touchdowns and 10 interceptions 
in his 10 starts this year. ``But only because I'm a competitor. At 
the same time, I respect his decision. I believe, from what he has 
told me, that he's looking out for my best interests and he's looking 
out for the team's best interests.'' Asked to characterize the opportunity 
he has been given, Graham said: ``I've got my foot in the door. That's 
probably the best way of saying it. I have a lot to prove, but I'm 
thankful for the opportunity to get that chance at least to prove 
it.''
