U.S. officials are set to wrap up talks in Peong Young on the dispute 
over a suspected North Korean nuclear weapon site. The U.S. delegation 
has been pressing American demands for access to the underground site 
since its arrival in North Korea Monday. North Korea has resisted 
claiming the site is for civilian use only. U.S. officials suspect 
the site is being used for nuclear weapons development in violation 
of a 1994 energy agreement with North Korea.
