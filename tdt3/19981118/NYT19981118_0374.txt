After two weeks of bloodletting over their leadership, House Republicans 
sent a mixed message Wednesday about the image they want to project 
in the upcoming 106th Congress _ they kept some leaders and threw 
out others, producing a team with a strong conservative cast that 
includes the party's first black leader. In a foregone conclusion, 
the party unanimously endorsed Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana 
as its nominee for speaker. He will replace Newt Gingrich, who was 
forced from office after the party lost seats in the Nov. 3 midterm 
elections. Livingston is to be elected speaker by the whole House 
on Jan. 6. Republicans kept Dick Armey as majority leader and Tom 
DeLay as majority whip. Both men, who are from Texas, are strong conservatives. 
But they ejected John Boehner of Ohio as Conference Chairman, replacing 
him with J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the first black Republican in a leadership 
role. And they repudiated John Linder of Georgia as chairman of the 
National Republican Congressional Committee, replacing him with Thomas 
Davis III of Virginia. Both Boehner and Linder bore some blame for 
the party's midterm stumble, in which it lost five House seats. The 
party put two women in its low-level leadership positions. The voting 
Wednesday by secret ballot took place behind the closed doors of the 
ornate caucus room in the Canon Office Building. Emerging midway through 
the day, Livingston stood with some of his new team, including Armey, 
with whom he and DeLay have had frosty relations. Setting a tone of 
low-key conciliation, Livingston pronounced his party ``united,'' 
adding: ``We're all going to have to work together,'' a daunting task 
that will entail ``reaching out to Democrats,'' given the party's 
narrow six-vote majority and the strength of its ideological wings 
on the left and on the right. ``We want the American people to know 
that they are going to get good, clean, honest, efficient government 
from us,'' Livingston added. ``We muffed our message a little bit 
in the last elections,'' he conceded. ``We may have slipped, but we 
haven't fallen.'' The party's priorities, he and others made clear, 
would be to save Social Security and enact tax cuts before the elections 
in 2000. Democrats sitting on the sidelines gloated that the Republicans 
had failed to make a clean sweep of their leadership and put a fresh 
face on their party. ``On the issues, there is no difference between 
Newt Gingrich and the new Republican leaders,'' said Roy Romer, general 
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The most intense action 
of the day came during the protracted four-way race for majority leader, 
the second in command. Armey won a majority of votes only after a 
third ballot, and seemed somewhat the bloodier for it. A relieved 
Armey described the ordeal as a ``merry chase.'' But his closest challenger, 
Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a fierce conservative and charter 
member of the revolutionary class of 1994, brooded after the battle: 
``Steve Largent has been too slow and too small his whole life, and 
this is just one more occasion,'' he said, a reference to criticism 
early in his football career, which started out rocky but culminated 
with his induction into the Hall of Fame. ``But I will tell you that 
I'm not accustomed to losing, and I don't like to lose.'' Also spurned 
for majority leader was Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, the first 
woman to run for a leadership position, who declared that even her 
attempt to run for office was a milestone. And a fledgling effort 
to draft Dennis Hastert of Illinois fell flat. In the first round 
of balloting, Armey won 100 votes, Largent, 58; Ms. Dunn, 45, and 
Hastert, 18. With no one winning a clear majority of 112, the person 
coming in last, Hastert, was dropped and a second ballot was held. 
On the second, Armey won 99, Largent, 73, and Ms. Dunn 49. On the 
third, Armey won 127 and Largent, 95. After retaining Armey, the party 
ousted two other incumbents from its hierarchy. In what some described 
as a burst of indignation, Republicans rejected Boehner as conference 
chairman. The chairman is responsible for presenting the party's message 
to the public and communicating leadership decisions and party policy. 
Watts blamed the leaders directly for the party's losses in the midterm 
elections. ``I'm a public relations major,'' he told reporters. ``And 
one of the things I found out in public relations is, it's very hard 
to P.R. a bad product. And we had a very bad product as Republicans 
coming down the stretch. And whether it was true or not, the perception 
was the presidential problems and Monica Lewinsky became our agenda.''
