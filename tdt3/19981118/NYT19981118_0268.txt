Max Ferra, the artistic director of Intar Hispanic American Arts Center, 
pays a nice tribute to Federico Garcia Lorca by including his 1929 
farce, ``The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife,'' on a bill of three works 
marking the playwright's centenary. Its 90 minutes of laughter is 
unexpected from a man usually associated with tragedy onstage and 
in life. A shoemaker (Bill Torres), who is 53, marries an 18-year-old 
woman (Denise Casano), to the delight of the town gossips, whom she 
enjoys answering with hilarious public scorn. She also delights in 
taunting her husband with tales of the young suitors she could have 
married, and that's her undoing. He walks out, and she is reduced 
to turning his shoeshop into a bar to make a living. Local lotharios 
fill the place, but she fends them off, protesting she loves only 
the missing shoemaker. Finally, she pours out her heart to an itinerant 
puppeteer who, overcome by her fidelity, reveals himself as her husband 
in disguise. That does it. After a moment of ecstasy, she's back to 
her old self, denouncing him to the town as ``crook, scoundrel, this 
riffraff.'' Ferra's direction makes this little comedy as fresh and 
lingering as a tart sorbet, and the production team gives it a bright 
fairy-tale appearance _ especially Katherine B. Roth, the costume 
designer, and Ralph Lee, the puppeteer and mask maker. For a mischievously 
talkative child, they have created a mask and costume that turn an 
adult actor (Doris DiFarnecio) into an improbably small puppet. And 
they've transformed the townsmen lusting after the wife into animals: 
the ridiculously hopeful old mayor (Carlos Rafart) barely conceals 
a wolf's gray tail under his frock coat; a young Mirlo (Oscar de la 
Fe Colon) sprouts a few crow feathers from under his collar and his 
nose is beaky; two small horns peak out from the hair of another youth 
(Carlos Orizondo), who thinks he's irresistible. By herself, Miriam 
Cruz, called the Woman in Red, could make up a town full of snoopy 
gossips, but she gets help from a pair of garish life-size puppets 
and from Colon and Orizondo in the guise of scandal-mongering, and 
much scandalized, women. The delight the whole cast takes in this 
concoction of sophisticated silliness is a needed reminder that Garcia 
Lorca, who knew how to reveal appalling darkness in the soul, was 
known to his friends as a young man with a singular passion for laughter.
