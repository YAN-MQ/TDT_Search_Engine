A doctor in Boston wasn't in an operating room when he assisted in 
the surgery of a Russian sailor. Actually, he was half a world away. 
David ropeik of affiliate wcvb explains. Dr. Dan Carlin runs something 
called world clinic, which can transmit by computer medical instructions 
to anyone with a satellite phone or computer online anywhere in the 
world. He's the doctor on call for solo sailors in an around-the-world 
race. One of those sailors, Victor yasekof, sent a satellite E-mail 
last week that his arm was infected and swollen, he couldn't use it, 
and the weather in the south atlantic was violent. Carlin had equipped 
each boat with medical equipment, and sent dramatic instructions. 
I took him through sterilizing the skin, sticking a knife into the 
abscess, draining the puss out, rinsing the puss pocket out, and putting 
in what we call a surgical drain -- a long cotton wick. Yasekof described 
in his computer the surgery. But he'd been taking aspirin, which thins 
the blood, and his bleeding wouldn't stop. He messaged that he was, 
"watching as my life drop by drop, leaving me." He tells parts of 
his story on the around-alone boat race home page. I didn't know what 
to do. I was afraid, and I think all around, everything covered by 
blood. On his own, yasekof tried a tourniquet, which stopped the bleeding 
but nearly killed his arm. Carlin messaged instructions to try a pressure 
bandage, which worked. And yasekof sailed 1,000 miles into cape town 
alive, his arm okay. This was a great outcome that happened to a really 
courageous, you know, really humble, delightful guy. So I'm intensely 
happy for him, and for my own perspective, it's incredibly rewarding 
as a doctor. That was David ropiek reporting.
