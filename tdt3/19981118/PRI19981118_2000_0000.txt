This is a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH, Boston. 
It's Wednesday, November 18th, I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Today, 
North Korea fails to satisfy US demands for access to a suspected 
Nuclear weapons sight. Jewish settlers, on the West Bank, throw a 
money wrench into the Middle-East peace process. And Slobodon Milosevic 
flunks the teachers of Serbia. Professors were physically carried 
out by hired bodyguards, actually. They were physically thrown out, 
carried out and thrown out. These are things you don't do at the university. 
Also, a different kind of soap from Israel. First, though, this news.
