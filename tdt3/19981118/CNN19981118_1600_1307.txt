Well, the New York Mets introduced their latest addition today in 
Queens. Yes, Bobby bonilla, back for a second go around in the big 
apple. You remember, the outfielder endured a rocky relationship with 
the media and fans during his first stint as a met. The amazings also 
announced that lefty Dennis cook will return with a Three-year deal 
worth $6.6 million. In 1998, the veteran reliever went 8-4 with a 
2.38 E.R.A. in 68 innings.
