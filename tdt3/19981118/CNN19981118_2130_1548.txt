Many people are looking forward to the Thanksgiving holiday. But there's 
another group that might be getting a little nervous. Joe gehl, of 
CNN affiliate ktvq, has details. Please, forgive them if they seem 
just a little nervous. It's just that lately, these turkeys sensed 
that something isn't quite right around here. You have to be quiet. 
We don't want them to know what the day is. It's D-day. Norma here 
admits while it may sound like a vegetarian's nightmare -- Ew, yeah. 
Like it or not, these farm-grown turkeys have reached the end of the 
line. Yeah, they've noticed there's a lot of people around. They've 
been a little bit noisier than usual. And you can just imagine what's 
going on in their heads. If they really are wondering what's up, well 
Norma isn't Gong to tell them. After all, she is -- I'm the Turkey 
lady. And that means she knows that today is the day thousands of 
the farm's Turkey's -- well, let's just say, take a dramatic step 
closer to joining you for Thanksgiving dinner. So, she's trying to 
be sensitive towards their feelings if they have any. These over here 
will be gone tomorrow. In fact, over the next several days, most of 
these birds will be processed and sold to local and area merchants 
just in time for thanksgiving. But don't worry about them, Norma will 
be good about keeping the plan quiet. Don't let 'em know.
