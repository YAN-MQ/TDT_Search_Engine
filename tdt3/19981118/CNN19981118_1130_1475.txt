If your dancing partner has two left feet, you might want to look 
elsewhere. The family dog might be dying to get its paws out on the 
dance floor. Jeannie Moos reports. They say it takes two to tango, 
two of what? Most of us have enough trouble just walking a dog straight 
ahead. Imagine, instead of a stroll, rock 'N' roll. We call it musical 
canine freestyle, dancing with dogs. Patie ventre is the organizer 
of the "pupperoni" canine freestylers. Do you ever say to him, "hey, 
I'm supposed to be leading"? Well, a lot of time he comes up with 
his own movements. That dog's got rhythm, look at it! Your dog doesn't 
have rhythm? Not that I know of. Yes, feed me. I'll do this if you 
feed me. Hey, treats might work getting guys out on the dance floor. 
He doesn't sit around watching old Fred Astaire movies, does he? I 
don't know what he's doing when I'm not home. When we're out together 
dancing cheek to cheek Make that cheek to jowl. So what if your partner 
occasionally gets distracted. Buck is no Rudolph nureyev, though he's 
mastered the leaps. Canine freestyle got its start less than ten years 
ago in Canada and england. Think of it as obedience training set to 
music. The owner can wear a costume. The dog, thankfully, cannot. 
About turn to the beat. Very nice! Donna gives lessons in canine freestyling. 
The sidestep and walking backwards are considered most difficult for 
dogs. Dog dancing leaves dog owners misty eyed. I almost cried, it 
was so beautiful. I had tears in my eyes. After all, when was the 
last time you saw this look of love in your partner's eyes? Do you 
dance much with humans? Not really. Do you dance with people? no. 
At least dogs don't tell anybody when you step on their feet. On the 
other hand, people tend not to scratch on the dance floor. Or, worse 
yet, lick themselves. Who is the John Travolta of dogs? Sparky. Rookie, 
the reigning champ, clearly suffers from "Saturday night fever." Jeannie 
Moos, CNN, king of prussia, Pennsylvania.
