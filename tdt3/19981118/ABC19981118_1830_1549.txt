Finally we are going to continue with our preview of previews of the 
millennium. Who was that woman last night from an advertising agency 
who said all the millennium products will be a real yawn. ABC's Robert 
Krulwich picks up where she left off. Businesses are in such a rush 
to bring products to market that say millennium on them, we decided 
to run a little quiz here in New York City, we handed out -- I've 
got a bottle of vitamins. I've got a box of some kind. I've got what 
appears to be a flag. Now I should tell you that each of these items 
has something wrong with it and in every case it's the same thing. 
We've counted this mistake on 150 other items of a like kind. The 
question is, what is wrong with the thing that you have? That's the 
question. If anybody finds it first, give us a hint to the rest of 
U.S. The only thing I can see that's wrong with them is that millennium 
is spelled incorrectly. It's spelled with only one "N." How do you 
spell millennium? That may be the key. The spelling of millennium, 
is that what it is? That's it. it's i-e? That is wrong. i-e-n, i-u-m 
-- That is wrong. i-e-l-l? No, no, no, that's not it. Not that anyone 
will notice, apparently. i-e, i-e? But as the millennium gets closer, 
we think as a public service, we should spell it once, correctly. 
so -- m-i-l Miell --? m l-e-n Nobody has been able to figure this 
out? n-i-u-m That's two Ls, two Ns. They should know how to spell 
it correctly. They certainly should. Is it E -- E-U-M instead of I? 
Is that what it is? Robert Krulwich, ABC News. Or is it one "L"? Two 
Ls, two Ns.
