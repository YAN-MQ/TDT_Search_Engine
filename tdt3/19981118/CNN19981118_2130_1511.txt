Sometime it's a little hard to fly like an eagle. It certainly was 
for this golden eagle who was waylaid while migrating south last week. 
After a brief recuperation at the Michigan state University veterinary 
clinic, she was able to fly again. The golden eagle was released yesterday, 
heading south again.
