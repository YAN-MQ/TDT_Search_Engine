top Israeli and Palestinian officials met in Jerusalem Wednesday. 
For their first discussion in more than two years on the final status 
issues of the peace process. VOA's David Gulles reports from Jerusalem. 
Palestinian negotiators, Mahud Aboss, a top aide to Yasser Arafat, 
is the most senior Palestinian official to visit Israel's foreign 
ministry compound. And with reporters present for the opening of the 
meeting, he had an amiable exchange with foreign minister, Ariel Sherone, 
who said the talks were not about the bitter history of the Israeli/Palestinian 
conflict. We are not going to talk about what happened in the past. 
I think we are looking forward to see how to be able to find a way 
for a lasting peace in the Middle East. The final status talks expected 
to convene in full sessions later this month will deal with the most 
difficult issues of the peace process including Jerusalem, the future 
of Jewish settlements in Palestinian areas, and the questions of Palestinian 
statehood. David Gulles, VOA News Jerusalem.
