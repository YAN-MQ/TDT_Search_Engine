They served time in Soviet prisons and Siberian labor camps for teaching 
Hebrew and encouraging immigration to Israel. Now, a group of former 
Soviet dissidents said Wednesday that Israel has forgotten them. Five 
Soviet refuseniks, so-named because they were refused permission to 
go to the Jewish state, told a news conference that the meager stipends 
they were receiving were being cut by the government. They demanded 
full state pensions. ``Thousands went around with our names engraved 
on their wrists, but as soon as we reached Israel, we became people 
of the past,'' said Ida Nudel, 67, a former Russian refusenik, who 
spent four years in Siberian exile for agitating on behalf of Jewish 
prisoners. Nudel is one of 850 ``prisoners of Zion'' living in Israel, 
members of the Jewish underground, mostly from the former Soviet Union, 
who risked their lives and freedom to protest human rights violations. 
Nudel, who reached Israel at the age of 57, said she expected Israel 
to take better care of her and her colleagues, many of whom arrived 
elderly or worn out from years of hard labor in prison and had little 
chance of employment. ``I came without language, without a profession,'' 
said Nudel. Nudel, who is retired and lives on income from writing 
and prizes received years ago, gets dlrs 250 each month from the Jewish 
Agency. The stipend is calculated on the basis of her four years in 
exile in Siberia but does not take into account the full 17 years 
she spent as an activist. ``I gave up everything to work in the underground,'' 
she said, adding that a pension would symbolize government recognition 
of her contribution. Last summer, in response to lobbying efforts 
by Nudel and others, Israel b'Aliyah, a party headed by former refusenik 
Natan Sharansky, now the trade minister, passed a law giving former 
prisoners of Zion a government stipend. But under the new arrangement, 
most people will actually receive less money than they got from the 
Jewish Agency. ``It's a grant; it's not a pension,'' said Roman Bronfman, 
the chairman of Israel b'Aliyah. Bronfman acknowledged that those 
who received money from the Jewish Agency would take a cut in benefits. 
But he said the new legislation would help a far larger group, about 
2,000, not just the 200 currently receiving grants from the Jewish 
Agency. He said the amount of money hadn't been determined yet, but 
it would be a few hundred dollars per month on average. Former prisoners 
of Zion said the new stipend neither honors their struggle nor pays 
the bills. ``We are not beggars,'' said Victor Brailovsky, who was 
jailed in Russia for creating a Jewish newspaper. ``We just want to 
get what we deserve.'' Other former Soviet activists attending the 
news conference were Yosef Begun, Vladamir Slepak and Yosef Mendelevich.
