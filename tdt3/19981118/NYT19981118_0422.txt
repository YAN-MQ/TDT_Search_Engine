As a panel of the House of Lords in London decides the legal fate 
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean Roman Catholic Church is pushing 
to reopen an investigation into the deaths and disappearances of activists 
during his regime. The move by Archbishop Francisco Javier Errazuriz 
of Santiago has quickly attracted the support of a wide range of prominent 
politicians. And while leaders have differing opinions about how far 
a new investigation should go, the momentum building behind the archbishop's 
proposal reflects how Pinochet's arrest in London last month has made 
human rights an important issue in the 1999 presidential race now 
getting under way. Errazuriz has called for the reconvening of a 1991 
Truth and Reconciliation panel, also known as the Rettig Commission, 
which identified more than 2,000 victims and detailed the circumstances 
surrounding their cases. The commission's report blamed the military 
and security forces for the vast majority of the deaths, most of which 
occurred between 1973 and 1978, but stopped short of identifying the 
officers and agents involved. Errazuriz has not said what he thinks 
the new commission's mandate should be, and the fate of his idea may 
depend on whether the Law Lords uphold a lower British court ruling 
and allow Pinochet to return to Chile. A reversal could open the way 
for the former dictator's extradition to Spain for him to stand trial 
on charges of genocide and murder. Most political observers say it 
is virtually unthinkable that an amnesty introduced by Pinochet while 
he was still in power could be reversed, or that the former dictator 
will be stripped of the legal immunity in Chile derived from his lifetime 
senate seat. But the possible identification of military officers 
involved in killings, including senior officers still on active duty, 
would be a dramatic departure from agreements made by civilians and 
Pinochet aides during talks leading to democratic rule. After meeting 
with the archbishop on Tuesday, Andres Zaldivar, the president of 
the senate and the leading presidential candidate of the governing 
Christian Democratic Party, said a new commission could shed light 
on the guilty and comfort families of the disappeared. ``We need to 
know where the bodies are, and we need justice,'' Zaldivar said. ``The 
Rettig Commission was a step forward, but we have to go much deeper.'' 
More surprising was the support given to the commission proposal by 
Sebastian Pinera, a former senator who is the presidential candidate 
of the conservative National Renovation Party, which includes many 
members who served in the Pinochet regime. ``The issue is the disappeared,'' 
Pinera said in an interview Wednesday. ``We have to do our best to 
find the bodies and return them to their families.'' But he said it 
would be unwise for a future commission to identify guilty officers, 
adding: ``That would only set a new fire. It's like in a marriage 
in which a wife and husband have been unfaithful but want to get back 
together again. How useful is it for them to know every single fact?'' 
Leftist politicians generally welcomed the archbishop's proposal.
