A stamp of approval for Republican Representative, Bob Livingston 
of Louisiana, as the new House Speaker. House Republicans endorsed 
the move today. He'll take over from outgoing speaker, Newt Gingrich. 
Livingston says his first job is to clean house. My first order is 
to really bring order to the House of Representatives, pride in the 
institution, and instill in the American people the understanding 
that we are all, Republican and Democrat, and Independent, hard-working 
people who are working in the best interest of our constituents. Bob 
Livingston, the next Speaker of the House.
