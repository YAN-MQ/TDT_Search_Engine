Even though the United States aborted a colossal attack on Iraq, Navy 
forces in the Gulf gained ``a tremendous amount'' of experience by 
executing the elaborate assault plan up to the eleventh hour, a senior 
Navy officer said. ``Everything was absolutely perfect. And next time 
it will be even more perfect,'' Capt. Denby Starling, the skipper 
of this aircraft carrier, told visiting journalists Tuesday. USS Eisenhower, 
carrying 4.1 million tons of ordnance, 10 F-14s and 36 F/A-18 strike 
fighters, was to have been the main punch of the planned Nov. 14 attack. 
The assault would have involved waves of air raids and a barrage of 
cruise missile strikes from support ships in the carrier's armada 
now patrolling the Gulf. ``We gained a tremendous amount,'' Starling 
said, speaking from the bridge high above the black flight deck of 
his 18-deck boat, which is the length of the Empire State Building. 
``We had an opportunity to do what we wouldn't routinely do. It is 
one thing to ... put (the crew) in a simulated environment. It is 
entirely different when you think it is the real thing,'' Starling 
said. Eisenhower's armada showcases some of the most best U.S. strike 
capability that would have been unleashed had Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein not backed down from its Oct. 31 decision to completely suspend 
U.N. weapons inspections. The inspectors resumed their work Wednesday. 
Iraq says it bowed to the diplomatic efforts of U.N. Secretary General 
Kofi Annan. Not many on the Eisenhower are convinced. ``Diplomacy? 
Yes, it was 95,000 tons of diplomacy that convinced Saddam,'' said 
Eisenhower spokesman Ernest Duplessis, referring to the amount of 
water that this nuclear-powered ship displaces. Many sailors interviewed 
on the ship said Iraq will likely break its pledge. Hopefully not 
soon, they add. Eisenhower is scheduled to return to its home in Norfolk, 
Virginia on Dec. 10 provided there is no emergency in the Gulf. Lisa 
Tobin, a 31-year-old native of Washington D.C., said she was a little 
disappointed when the strike was called off at the last moment. But 
now she is ``just anxious to get home for Christmas,'' said Tobin, 
who maintains small arms and a fire fighting system in the weapons 
magazine. But even as the U.S. military rolls down its sleeve, the 
muscle that was only brandished remains evident in the daily routines 
on the ship. Just below the flight deck is Command Chaplain Sheila 
Robertson's office where conversations take place in between the thundering 
take off and landings. Planes are catapulted on the 319-foot (96-meter) 
runway with steel slings that send the aircraft from 0 to 180 mph 
(290kmph) in three seconds. They touch down on a narrow square, and 
cords strung across the deck arrest the plane to bring them to a halt 
almost instantly. ``I would like to know who built the chaplain's 
office here,'' Robertson said good humoredly, adding: ``It would be 
nice to get back home. There will actually be a Christmas.''
