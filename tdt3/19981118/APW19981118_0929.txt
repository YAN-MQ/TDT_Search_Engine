The Swiss government said Wednesday it will publish in January the 
names of some 580 mostly East Europeans whose unclaimed assets were 
pooled into a humanitarian fund. Applications for compensation will 
be processed by the Swiss foreign ministry. The compensation paid 
will be the value of the account with interest at a rate of 3.5 percent 
per year. In 1962, Swiss financial institutions were required to register 
with the government deposits unclaimed since the end of World War 
II. The government issued a decree transferring assets for which no 
entitled owner could be found into a central fund. The money was later 
used by Swiss humanitarian organizations. In some cases, no search 
for the account holders was made. ``These concerned assets of less 
than 1,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 730 at 1998 rates) as well as assets 
of people whose domicile or nationality was unknown or their final 
residence was in the then Communist countries of Eastern Europe,'' 
the government said in a statement. In the case of the latter, searches 
were not made ``because it was feared that those affected would otherwise 
be subjected to material and immaterial hardship by their home countries,'' 
it continued. The 3.5 percent interest rate was devised to reflect 
a fair increase in the value of the deposits, taking into account 
that the money was used only for humanitarian purposes and that no 
one profited from holding it, officials said. The list will be published 
and posted on the Internet. Account holders and their heirs will be 
able to contact Swiss embassies abroad and an information center in 
Bern. Tracing the owners is expected to cost some 3 million francs 
(dlrs 2.19 million). Compensation could amount to 7 million francs 
(dlrs 5.11 million) if all applications are approved, said Marie-Marceline 
Kurmann, spokeswoman for the government's task force on World War 
II. The government said all cases, including those where heirs lived 
in Western Europe, can be compensated. But account owners who lived 
in Poland and Hungary will be excluded as those countries have already 
been compensated for the assets and are themselves searching for those 
affected, it added. Following a historians' report, the government 
in February 1997 agreed in principle to compensate traceable owners 
as a ``solidarity gesture.'' Subsequent investigations, carried out 
as part of the response to intense international criticism over Switzerland's 
wartime record and especially that of its banks, uncovered far more 
dormant accounts. The Swiss Bankers Association last year published 
two lists of account holders. In October 1997, it said it was ``confident 
that the vast majority of dormant assets from the period prior to 
1945 have been identified.''
