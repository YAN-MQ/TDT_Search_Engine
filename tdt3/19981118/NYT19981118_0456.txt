c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service WASHINGTON _ France was not told by 
the United States or by Britain precisely when the two countries planned 
to attack Iraq last weekend and could not have tipped off Baghdad, 
senior French officials said Wednesday. Even if the French had known, 
a French official insisted angrily, Paris would certainly not have 
passed the information on to Baghdad. Suspicions were raised last 
weekend that the Iraqis somehow learned of the imminence of the attack, 
whereupon they sent a letter pledging to allow arms inspectors to 
begin work once again. The attack was then called off. A senior British 
official said that Paris did not know the exact timing of the attack. 
Very few British officials knew, this official said, and he thought 
that representatives at the United Nations would be unlikely to have 
been among those told. U.S. and British officials said they had no 
indication that Baghdad had been tipped off to the imminent air strikes, 
explaining that they had not noticed any unusual activity by the Baghdad 
authorities on Friday. ``There were things we expected them to protect 
that were left exposed,'' one official said. U.S. intelligence officials 
said that there was evidence that the Iraqis were themselves surprised 
at how close they came to getting bombed. The officials said there 
was ``no evidence'' of any leak to the Iraqis. A senior U.S. official 
would not comment on whether Paris knew about the exact timing of 
the raid, saying only that Washington was in close touch with French 
authorities throughout the crisis. But the official emphasized that 
there was no evidence whatever that the Iraqis were tipped off by 
anyone. Russian officials in particular had tried to impress on Baghdad 
that the threat of force was real and imminent, but anyone watching 
television would have known that the Americans were ready to strike, 
said Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser. 
On Monday, the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, vehemently 
rejected a suggestion on Sunday by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that 
a French tip-off might explain Saddam's fortuitously timed letter 
allowing the United Nations to resume weapons inspections. McCain 
himself said later that he had no special knowledge before making 
his comments on a Sunday television show. Vedrine called the accusation 
``both shameful and completely idiotic.'' In fact, he said, ``all 
the Iraqi leaders had to do was read the international press and watch 
CNN to know they were threatened with an imminent strike, and that 
certainly played a key role in the volte-face we all sought.'' Francois 
Delattre, the French Embassy spokesman here, said he had little to 
add to Vedrine's statement except to say that ``French officials are 
outraged'' by the insinuation at a time when French and U.S. positions 
on Iraq are as close as they have ever been.
