The federal government is taking another step toward truth in advertising 
when it comes to dietary supplements. The federal trade commission 
has issued new guidelines for the billion-dollar industry. Supplement 
manufacturers must now explain what their products do, and back up 
those claims with scientific evidence. Consumer advocates say the 
guidelines are inherently weak because the government doesn't have 
the resources to enforce them.
