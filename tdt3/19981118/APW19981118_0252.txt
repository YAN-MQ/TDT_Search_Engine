The giant Gazprom natural gas company expects bad financial results 
for the rest of the year because of poor market conditions and may 
be facing a loss, Chairman Rem Vyakhirev said Wednesday. A sharp drop 
in world oil prices and poor domestic conditions had hit the company, 
he said. ``We will have bad results,'' Vyakhirev said. ``I think we 
will even make a loss.'' Vyakhirev said payments for gas deliveries 
dropped dramatically when Russia's latest financial crisis broke out 
in August after the government defaulted on its treasury debt. In 
September, the virtual collapse of the banking system brought all 
payments to a halt. ``In August, (payments) were very bad, and in 
September almost no payments were made,'' Vyakhirev said. He said 
the situation was now improving and payments rising. In October, the 
central bank made some progress in restarting the banking system and 
the weakening of the ruble slowed.
