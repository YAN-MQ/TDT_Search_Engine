Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. was in an expansive mood Wednesday, his 41st birthday, 
after being elected chairman of the Republican Conference and promising 
to put ``feet and words and message'' to his party's policies. ``We're 
a party of men and women, and red, yellow, brown, black and white 
Americans,'' he said. ``I think we want to say to everybody that you're 
welcome in the Republican Party.'' The Oklahoma congressman's language 
of inclusiveness was a small paradox, in a way, because for much of 
his political career _ indeed, for much of his life _the adjectives 
most often linked to him were ``the first'' and ``the only.'' A native 
of Eufaula, Okla., where his father was the first black police officer, 
Julius Caesar Watts Jr. helped to integrate Jefferson Davis Elementary 
School. He was not the only black child at the school honoring the 
president of the Confederacy (there was one other), but he was the 
first black quarterback at his high school. After leading the University 
of Oklahoma football team to consecutive Orange Bowl victories, in 
1980 and 1981, he played professional football in Canada for several 
years. In 1990 he became the first black to win statewide elected 
office in Oklahoma, capturing a seat on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, 
which regulates oil and gas utilities. In 1994, he was elected to 
Congress from the Fourth District in southwestern Oklahoma. For two 
years, there was one other black Republican in the House, Gary A. 
Franks of Connecticut, but when Watts won re-election in 1996 and 
Franks did not, Watts found himself the only black Republican in the 
House. He is the only black who does not belong to the Congressional 
Black Caucus, and Wednesday he became the first black Republican ever 
elected to a leadership post. Yet in many ways he talks like a consummate 
team player, and has been seen by his party colleagues as one. His 
remarks to reporters Wednesday could have been taken from the Republican 
hornbook. ``I'm excited about everybody working together as a team 
to make sure that we cut people's taxes, that we strengthen our national 
defense, that we strengthen Social Security, we continue working on 
a health-care system to make it better,'' he said. Partisan bromides 
aside, Watts, an ordained Baptist minister, is acknowledged as an 
inspiring speaker. He was picked by his party to deliver its response 
to President Clinton's State of the Union Message in January 1997. 
``You know, I'm just old enough to remember the Jim Crow brand of 
discrimination,'' he said then. ``In my lifetime there have been some 
great and good laws that took some evil and ignorant laws off the 
books.'' But, he went on, ``if legislation is the answer to the racial 
divide in our nation, then why _ in God's name, in our time _ has 
the division grown?'' ``The fact is,'' he said, ``our problems can't 
be solved by legislation alone. In fact, government sometimes rubs 
the wound raw, and makes the healing harder.'' He went on to extol 
the Republican ideals of self-reliance, responsibility, morality. 
``We must be a people who dare _ dare to take responsibility for our 
hatreds and fears and ask God to heal us from within.'' Watts' words 
have occasionally been more pungent, as when he referred to ``race-hustling 
poverty pimps,'' black politicians whose careers, he said, hinged 
on keeping many black people dependent on government. (That remark, 
in a interview in The Washington Post two years ago, caused a furor 
as Watts insisted he was not referring to the Rev. Jesse Jackson.) 
Watts has deplored President Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal but has not said what he thinks should be done about it. His 
deputy press secretary, Tobi Edwards, said he would wait until the 
House Judiciary Committee conducted its business before commenting. 
Watts and his wife, Frankie, have five children from grade-school 
age to their early 20s. The congressman and his wife were already 
planning a birthday celebration Wednesday night, before his election 
to the leadership post. ``It's probably going to be a bigger party 
than we thought,'' Ms. Edwards said. But not a wild one. The congressman 
is a teetotaler.
