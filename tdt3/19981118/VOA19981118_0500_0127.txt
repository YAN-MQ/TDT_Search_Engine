Well after a two-day summit in Malaysia, leaders of Pacific Rim nations 
issued a joint statement Wednesday. Amy Vickers reports from Kuala 
Lumpur. The communique focuses on reviving Asia's beleaguered economies. 
Leaders from the 21 countries that comprise the Asia Pacific economic 
cooperation forum unveiled a multifaceted plan to turn around Asia's 
troubled economies. After spending the day in closed-door talks just 
outside of Malaysia's capital, the leaders issued a communique detailing 
plans to revitalize Asia's private sector and reinforce its social 
safety net. They also endorsed a plan to liberalize trade in nine 
sectors, including chemicals and telecommunications equipment. And 
they voiced strong approval of a $10 billion U.S.-Japan initiative 
to help companies and banks struggle with bad debts. The leaders noted 
that while some countries had made progress towards overcoming the 
financial crisis, there is still a long way to go. Amy Vickers for
