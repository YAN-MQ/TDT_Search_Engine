The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 19: When 
one of the Supreme Court's most conservative members, Justice Antonin 
Scalia, writes a decision strengthening civil rights enforcement, 
it is worth taking note. It happened this week in a closely watched 
discrimination case from South Carolina. The decision concerned a 
collective bargaining agreement between the International Longshoremen's 
Association and the Port of Charleston. Like most labor agreements 
these days, it contained a clause requiring workplace disputes to 
be submitted to arbitration. A federal appellate court interpreted 
the clause as stripping a longshoreman, Caesar Wright, of his right 
to sue under the Americans With Disabilities Act. Wright could not 
go to court with his claim of discrimination, the court said, because 
his union had effectively waived that right when it negotiated the 
arbitration clause. Fortunately, a unanimous Supreme Court has now 
rejected this watering down of federal protection. Vaguely worded 
arbitration clauses in labor contracts, the justices held, cannot 
bar access to federal court by employees seeking to vindicate their 
rights under federal civil rights laws. ``The right to a federal judicial 
forum is of sufficient importance to be protected against less-than-explicit 
union waiver'' of the right to go to court, said Scalia, writing for 
the court. Disappointingly, the court stopped short of finding that 
even an explicit waiver would be unenforceable. But that may not matter 
for most employees. Few labor agreements currently contain explicit 
waivers of federal civil rights claims.
