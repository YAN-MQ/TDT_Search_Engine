Jabuti has severed diplomatic relations with Ara Triap after Asmara 
accused it of supporting Ethiopia in an Ara Triap /Ethiopia border 
conflict. Jabuti's ambassador to the United States told VOA his country 
has nothing to do with the conflict between the two neighbors. He 
said Jabuti has been trying to seek a peaceful solution to the dispute.
