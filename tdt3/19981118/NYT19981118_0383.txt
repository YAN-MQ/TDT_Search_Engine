Esther Rolle, a pioneering African-American actress who gained national 
recognition in the 1970s for her role as Florida Evans on two television 
shows, first ``Maude'' and then ``Good Times,'' died at a hospital 
here on Tuesday. She was 78 and lived in Los Angeles. Larry Calhoun, 
her longtime publicist, said the cause of death had not been determined, 
but he added that Ms. Rolle had been suffering from diabetes and had 
been under dialysis. He said she had celebrated her 78th birthday 
a little more than a week ago, and that one of the last things she 
had done was to write a check to support a local black theater, something 
she had done most of her career. Ms. Rolle met with many of her old 
friends and cast members of the two television shows last week in 
a gathering here for a People magazine article. Norman Lear, one of 
the executive producers of both of her shows, said the once-stocky 
actress appeared thin but vibrant, and that she had a role in a forthcoming 
movie, ``Down in the Delta,'' directed by poet Maya Angelou and scheduled 
for release this month. Ms. Rolle became famous for playing the role 
of a strong-willed maid on television, and in that role she also performed 
memorably in the play ``A Raisin in the Sun,'' in the television movie 
``Summer of My German Soldier,'' for which she won an Emmy Award in 
1979, and in the movie ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' She also appeared in 
the film ``Rosewood.'' She spoke firmly and often about about her 
desire to fight black stereotypes on television and even left the 
cast of ``Good Times'' for a while, saying at the time that she resented 
the image presented by the buffoonish character of her son in the 
show. In the show she played the matriarch of a struggling black family 
in Chicago. Ms. Rolle was well known for her strong personality, both 
on and off screen, and her ear for the nuances of race relations. 
Lear, who was the executive producer of ``All in the Family,'' from 
which ``Maude'' and ``Good Times'' were spun off, said one of his 
most vivid memories of Ms. Rolle was a musical number she performed 
with Beatrice Arthur, the actress who played Maude. Lear said that 
every year there was a musical number on the show, and one season 
Ms. Rolle and Ms. Arthur performed ``Me and My Shadow.'' Ms. Arthur 
kept trying to stand in back and play the shadow in the scene, but 
Ms. Rolle kept slipping behind her, a striking metaphor for the subtleties 
of race relations that Lear described as ``an indelible memory of 
an indelible woman.'' Ms. Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, Fla., a 
retirement community that was once a bucolic farming town with the 
character of the Deep South. She was the 10th of 18 children, and 
her father was a farmer. She had a theatrical bent and after high 
school followed her sister, Rosanna Carter, also an actress, to New 
York. She was one of the early members of the Negro Ensemble Company 
in New York and in the late 1950s performed with Shologa Oloba, an 
African-American dance troupe. In 1958 she and her sister appeared 
with the company in a revival of Asadata Dafora's ``Zunguru.'' In 
1990 she became the first woman to receive the NAACP Chairman's Civil 
Rights Leadership Award for her work improving the image of blacks. 
Ms. Rolle's marriage ended in divorce, and she had no children, her 
publicist said. She is survived by two sisters and a brother.
