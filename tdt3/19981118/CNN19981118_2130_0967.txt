A survey of 766 California doctors suggests many physicians in managed 
care believe the financial pressures of HMOs interfere with patient 
care. Most of the primary care physicians polled say they are under 
the gun to see more patients and refer fewer to specialists. The survey 
comes after several large groups of doctors defected from HMOs in 
four other states. An industry official says the survey is flawed 
and exaggerates any unhappiness. The study is published in the "New 
England journal of medicine."
