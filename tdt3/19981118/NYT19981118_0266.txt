A dinner party at Harpagon's house probably wouldn't be a good time. 
Preparing for such a gathering in Act II of ``The Miser,'' he instructs 
one servant to pour the wine ``but only when people are thirsty'' 
_ that is, when ``they have asked several times.'' And, he adds, put 
water in it. As for the food: ``Prepare for eight,'' he tells the 
cook, ``and there's always plenty for 10.'' Harpagon, after all, is 
a man who whispers sweet nothings to the cash box he keeps hidden 
in the garden and is eager to marry his daughter off to the first 
man who says he'll take her without a dowry. Never mind that the man 
is twice her age and that she's secretly in love with one of the servants, 
who is secretly a member of Neapolitan nobility. Of course, Harpagon's 
biggest problem is that he and his son want to marry the same young 
woman. Many Moliere admirers consider ``The Miser'' one of his lesser 
works _ or at least a particularly odd one, since the title character 
is undeniably pathological. But for those of us willing to consider 
the possibility of dark farce, the production is a delight, and the 
Pearl Theater Company shows off all the comedy's best features. For 
a play that had its premiere in 1668, ``The Miser'' contains a lot 
of up-to-date observations. Harpagon (Robert Hock, appropriately appalling) 
comments on the credentials of guests: ``The world is full of self-styled 
nobility these days.'' Elise (Patricia Dalen), the beautiful daughter, 
is skeptical about her suitor's vows: ``Men are all alike in their 
promises,'' she says, and differ only in their deeds. That suitor, 
Valere (Bo Foxworth), assures her that he knows how to handle characters 
like her father. ``Pretend to agree with them,'' he explains. ``The 
most cunning of men are most easily deceived.'' Cleante (Christopher 
Moore), the foppish son, doesn't comment so much on human behavior, 
but he makes a spectacular entrance wearing bright blue and mustard 
yellow and shoulder-length golden curls. He is carrying two hatboxes 
(one yellow, one blue) and what appears to be a garment bag (lavender). 
He, like many of the characters, virtually prances across the stage. 
There is plenty to prance about: borrowing and lending, stealing and 
returning, disinheriting and cursing. There are even reunions of long-lost 
family members. Murell Horton's off-kilter, attic-clutter set is clever, 
and his costumes are vivid and attractive. It is an interesting choice, 
though, amid a stageful of 17th-century styles, to have some characters 
dressed out of period. For instance, Frosine (Robin Leslie Brown), 
the matchmaker, wearing ostrich feathers and a short black lace skirt, 
might have wandered in from the Weimar Republic. And the gown worn 
by Marianne (Lauren Stamile) could have come from a Neiman Marcus 
catalog. But Ms. Stamile, who is making her New York acting debut, 
is such a vision of brainless loveliness that it really doesn't matter. 
``The Miser,'' ebulliently directed by David Schechter continues through
