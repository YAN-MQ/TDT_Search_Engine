Only two days before he died, Weeb Ewbank watched the New York Jets-Indianapolis 
Colts National Football League game from the owner's box at the RCA 
Dome in Indianapolis. How fitting. Ewbank, who coached both teams 
to national prominence and league championships, died Tuesday at his 
home. He was 91. Ewbank's death followed by four days the passing 
of a New York contemporary, Red Holzman, who coached the New York 
Knicks to two championships in 1970 and 1973 while Ewbank was leading 
the New York Jets. The cause of Ewbank's death was not released immediately. 
The Hall of Famer was hospitalized briefly last year for a heart problem. 
Ewbank was the only coach to win titles in the American Football League 
and National Football League. He earned championships in two of pro 
football's most memorable games _ the 1969 Super Bowl with the Jets 
and the 1958 NFL title with the Baltimore Colts. ``Weeb combined a 
low-key style with a flair for the most dramatic of accomplishments,'' 
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``He led two of the legendary 
teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred 
to stay in the background and let the players take the credit.'' Ewbank 
guided Joe Namath and the Jets over heavily favored Baltimore 16-7 
in the third Super Bowl, giving the AFL its first title over the more 
established NFL. ``All of us knew he didn't have much time because 
of his age, but it's still a shock and takes everything out of you,'' 
Namath said Wednesday. ``I don't know how else to deal with it other 
than to say it is like you see a football and jam it with a nail and 
the air comes out. That is how you feel. You feel very empty, something 
is gone and you are afraid it is not going to be back and it won't. 
``It is an awful feeling and you miss him a great deal already.'' 
In 1958, Ewbank coached Johnny Unitas and the Colts to a 23-17 overtime 
win over the New York Giants. Often called ``The Greatest Game Ever 
Played,'' it was credited with making pro football one of the most 
popular American sports. ``He was just a fine gentleman, to me the 
best coach I ever played for,'' Unitas told the New York Post. ``I've 
always been indebted to him for letting me come to Baltimore to play 
football for him.'' Ewbank also led the Colts over the Giants 31-16 
for the title in 1959. He posted a 130-129-7 record during 20 seasons 
as a pro coach. He coached the Colts from 1954 to 1962 and the Jets 
from 1963 to 1973. Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula said Ewbank ``helped 
shape my coaching philosophy.'' ``When I replaced him as head coach 
of the Colts, many of the things I did in Baltimore and then in Miami 
I learned from him,'' Shula said. ``I greatly admired Weeb,'' Jets 
board chairman Leon Hess said. ``He was a man who knew everything 
there was to know about football organization and player motivation.'' 
Don Maynard, the Jets' star receiver under Ewbank, said the coach 
treated his players like family. ``On Saturdays, he'd let you bring 
your kids to the workouts,'' Maynard recalled from his home in El 
Paso, Texas. ``He also let you bring your friends to the dressing 
room after the game. I remember I brought Charlie Pride and Willie 
Nelson in.'' Born Wilbur Charles Ewbank, the native of Richmond, Indiana, 
lived with his wife, Lucy, in Oxford. He is survived by his wife, 
three daughters, eight grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren. Despite 
health problems that included an artificial hip, Ewbank still followed 
football closely in his later years. He watched NFL games every weekend, 
usually with his wife. Ewbank was a guest of the Jets' organization 
Sunday and saw the Indianapolis Colts rally past New York 24-23. In 
addition to coaching in two of pro football's most memorable title 
games, Ewbank coached the Jets in the famous ``Heidi'' game in 1968 
_ played exactly 30 years ago Tuesday _ and the first Monday night 
game in 1970. Ewbank retired after the 1973 season, coaching his last 
game on Dec. 16, the day O.J. Simpson broke Jim Brown's single-season 
rushing mark and the 2,000-yard plateau for the season on a snowy 
day at Shea Stadium. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame in Canton, Ohio, in 1978.
