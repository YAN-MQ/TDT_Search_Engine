You've tried the patch. You've tried hypnosis. Maybe you've even tried 
chewing that dreadful nicotine gum. None of it worked, did it? Well, 
here's the latest, sure-fire way to beat the smoking habit: Pet sounds. 
No, not the Beach Boys album; I'm talking about the actual sounds 
that pets make. Dogs barking. Cats purring. Birds tweeting. Fish ... 
well, I'm not sure what sound fish make, but you get the picture. 
Studies have shown that pet ownership can help lower blood pressure, 
fight depression and just generally reduce stress. And since few things 
are more stressful than quitting smoking, the American Pet Products 
Manufacturers Association came up with the idea of using pet sounds 
to help people kick the filthy habit. To participate in the ``Pets 
Can Help You Quit Smoking Program,'' you send in a pack of your favorite 
coffin nails and receive, in return, a free Pet Starter Kit that consists 
of a 4-minute audio cassette tape filled with ``soothing and relaxing 
pet sounds.'' The thinking here, apparently, is that the nightmarish 
symptoms of nicotine withdrawal will be alleviated by the steady yapping 
of a Shih Tzu or the yowling of a Siamese. If the APPMA is lucky, 
the cassette tapes will de-stress you to the point that you decide 
to acquire a pet of your very own, preferably one with a taste for 
the bowls, leashes, food and other pet paraphernalia endorsed by APPMA. 
But the Pet Starter Kit is more than a marketing gimmick. (Not a lot 
more, admittedly, but somewhat more.) It is the first time, to my 
knowledge, that pets have ventured into the lucrative field of alternative 
medicine. Forget about valerian, ginseng and St. John's wort; if you 
want to achieve ``wellness,'' simply slip on a pair of headphones 
and listen to the soothing sounds of a $150 tropical fish floating 
belly-up to the surface of its aquarium. In the future, the term ``dog 
and cat clinic'' may take on a whole new meaning. Instead of taking 
your pet in for medical treatment, you receive medical treatment from 
your pet. I wouldn't be surprised if scientists and/or marketers soon 
discover that pets' therapeutic powers extend far beyond a simple 
``bow-wow'' or ``meow.'' For example, we may come to realize that 
dogs that dig holes in your back yard deep enough to bury the Starr 
Report are good for dry skin and congestion. Cats that drop the head 
of a squirrel on your lap with the same pride a fisherman might display 
a trophy bass may serve as a remedy for baldness, toenail fungus and 
hemorrhoids. Giant pet iguanas that leap on your neck and sink their 
claws into your carotid may cure drowsiness, depression and feelings 
of low self-esteem. We already know that pets can help improve your 
circulation, such as when you chase your dog around the living room 
trying to retrieve your slipper, and also help reduce your cholesterol, 
such as when your cat eats your lasagna while you're busy talking 
on the phone. If they can help you quit smoking, too, that would be 
an added bonus. To receive your very own Pet Starter Kit, write to:
