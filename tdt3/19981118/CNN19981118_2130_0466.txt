A British attack submarine has successfully fired a tomahawk cruise 
missile off the coast of California. It is the first such live warhead 
test by Britain. The submarine "hms splendid" fired the tomahawk missile 
500 miles to the target on San Clemente island. The splendid is the 
first British submarine with that capability. Britain had conducted 
two tests of nonexplosive warheads off California earlier this month.
