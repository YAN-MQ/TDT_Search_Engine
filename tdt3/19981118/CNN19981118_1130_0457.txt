I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Forecast temperatures today only in the 20s over the upper midwest. 
It will be warm though along the gulf coast. And back into Florida, 
with forecast highs into the 80s. Area of low pressure will be tracking 
through the midwest and that's going to bring some heavy snows through 
sections of the dakotas and northern minnesota today. Look for windy 
conditions through the Great Lakes, as well as that area of low pressure 
moves through. By late tomorrow, frontal system approaching the pacific 
northwest will bring chances for some rain there. As we head into 
Friday, though, that storm in the pacific northwest picks up. We'll 
find heavy rain and windy conditions. Rain likely in the northeast 
as well with snow lingering back through the eastern Great Lakes and 
especially in through Canada as temperatures remain cold through the 
Great Lakes. On Saturday, again the pacific northwest will see problems 
with more heavy rain and windy conditions. Showers likely in parts 
of Texas. And on Sunday, much the same story for the pacific northwest, 
more heavy rain is in the forecast.
