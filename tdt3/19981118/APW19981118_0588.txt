Moldova's Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc was taken suddenly to the hospital 
for treatment for an illness that government officials declined to 
name, his office said Wednesday. Ciubuc, 55, was brought to the hospital 
by ambulance Tuesday. Some media reports in this former Soviet republic 
said he had a heart attack, though his office would not comment on 
the speculation. Ciubuc canceled a visit to Croatia for a meeting 
of Central European leaders scheduled for Nov. 20-21. His deputy Ion 
Sturza will replace him. Ciubuc's government on Friday survived a 
no-confidence vote in parliament. Moldova is suffering a severe economic 
decline following the crisis in Russia, its main trading partner.
