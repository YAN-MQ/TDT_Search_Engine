Indian security forces and Muslim rebels clashed in several areas 
of Kashmir on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, officials said. 
At least six guerrillas died in fighting in the mountainous region 
of Charri Pathri, about 150 kilometers (95 miles) northeast of Jammu. 
One soldier also died. In Chandmarh, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) 
north of Jammu, three militants were killed in another clash, and 
at least seven rebels were killed in other fighting throughout the 
region, said army spokesman Maj. P. Purushottam. Meanwhile, six villagers 
trying to salvage metal from a military ammunition dump in the village 
of Khundroo were killed in an explosion Tuesday when they ignored 
soldiers' warnings to stay clear, Purushottam said. Three others were 
injured. Soldiers had set two blasts to destroy the old ammunition, 
65 kilometers (40 miles) south of the capital Srinagar, Purushottam 
said. But they were overpowered by dozens of village scrap dealers 
who rushed onto the dump and accidentally set off the blast.
