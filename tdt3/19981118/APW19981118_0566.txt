The editor and a staff reporter from an independent daily newspaper 
in Benin were sentenced to six months in prison for defaming a former 
government minister, a court official said Wednesday. Maurice Chabi, 
the editor of Echoes of the Day newspaper and a reporter, Pascal Zantou, 
were sentenced Tuesday after they were found guilty of libel. Chabi 
was sentenced in absentia and has been missing since the verdict was 
announced earlier this week. The newspaper earlier this year published 
a report that claimed former Education Minsister Djidjoho Padonou 
has embezzeled state funds. The court said the claims were groundless 
and found both Zantou, the author of the original article, and Chabi 
guilty of libel.
