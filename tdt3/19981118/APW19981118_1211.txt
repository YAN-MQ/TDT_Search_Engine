A court ruled Wednesday that an automobile repair shop could not be 
found guilty of discrimination despite hiring an inexperienced white 
man over an experienced black applicant. The case in the Labor Court 
could increase already-strong criticism that Sweden, despite its image 
of racial tolerance, has an insufficient anti-discrimination law. 
Current law states that an employer can be found guilty only if it 
can be shown that the employer intended to discriminate. ``The big 
stumbling-block was that I did not succeed in showing that the employer 
probably chose to discriminate,'' Discrimination Ombudsman Margareta 
Wadstein, who brought the case to the labor court, was quoted as saying 
by the news agency TT. The small repair shop had advertised last year 
for a mechanic. The two prime job candidates were a white man and 
a Ugandan immigrant who now holds Swedish citizenship. Both had similar 
training in auto mechanics, but the black man had five months of work 
experience, while the other candidate had none. The court ruled that 
the plaintiff did not succeed in proving that the black man was not 
hired because of his race. The ruling comes at a time when Sweden 
has become increasingly sensitive about racial questions. A study 
submitted to the parliament last year said Sweden's large number of 
immigrants are not being integrated into society successfully, suffering 
from higher-than-average unemployment and increasingly living in outlying 
suburbs where an ever-fewer number of native Swedes live. Meanwhile, 
open signs of anti-immigrant sentiment are increasing. A black politician 
in the town of Varberg resigned this month, saying he had repeatedly 
received threating telephone calls, and a firebomb was tossed Monday 
at a building housing refugees in the town of Flen.
