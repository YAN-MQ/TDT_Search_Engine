German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, has ended a state visit to Moscow. 
He is pledging to uphold close bilateral relations, but declining 
to offer Russia any new money. On Tuesday, Mr. Schroder told President, 
Boris Yeltsin, he is interested in strengthening political and economic 
ties. Mr. Schroder ruled out additional aide to Russia outside a loan 
package negotiated with the International Monetary fund.
