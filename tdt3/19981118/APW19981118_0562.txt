Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet approved plans Wednesday to 
commit 250 German army soldiers to the NATO ``extraction force'' being 
set up to protect unarmed observers in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo 
province. The plan was expected to get the necessary parliamentary 
approval on Thursday. Parliament cleared the way last Friday for 350 
German soldiers and 16 unmanned spy planes to take part in NATO air 
surveillance over Kosovo. NATO's aim is to monitor the withdrawal 
of Serb forces from Kosovo and the safety of some 2,000 unarmed international 
observers. The 1,700-strong ``extraction force,'' intended to rescue 
the observers if they run into trouble, is to be based in neighboring 
Macedonia.
