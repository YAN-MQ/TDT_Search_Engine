New labels should soon appear on dietary supplements. The federal 
trade commission today will issue guidelines that would require manufacturers 
of dietary supplements to support claims about what their products 
can do. The labels should also explain the benefits which makers imply 
in advertising. By law, dietary supplements, which can be sold without 
government approval, cannot promise to directly treat or prevent disease. 
Americans spend about $5 billion on supplements a year.
