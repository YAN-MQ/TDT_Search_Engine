To most people it's known as a deadly poison. But to some leukemia 
patients, it could become a cure. Researchers say extremely low doses 
of arsenic can kill cancer cells in people with a type of leukemia 
called apl. Just to think you have to take a poison that would kill 
someone who is healthy to make myself live, it was kind of, it's scary 
really. In a study published in "the New England journal of medicine," 
8 of 12 patients had complete remission of their apl after treatment 
with arsenic. Doctors say unlike chemotherapy, there are very few 
serious side effects. But experts caution arsenic can be deadly at 
higher doses. There have been reports of toxic neuro effects, kidney 
effects and we're going to have to be careful as we increase the doses 
in clinical trials. More trials are on the way, and doctors say they 
could have a Cure for apl by the year 2000.
