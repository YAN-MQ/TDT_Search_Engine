And we had a good day on Wall Street with the Dow Jones Industrial 
average closing at 9,041 that was up 54 points. The Standard & Poor's 
500 index closed at 1144 and that was up five points. Analysts say 
although traders continue to be positive about yesterday's interest 
rate cut by the U.S. Central Bank, there was some caution. There is 
now a feeling on Wall Street that Tuesday's action may be the last 
interest rate cut for at least the next few months. The big question 
is are interest rates now low enough to boost the U.S. economy and 
cause corporate profits to rise?
