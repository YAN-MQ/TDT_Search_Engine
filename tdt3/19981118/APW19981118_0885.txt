A former M15 intelligence agent walked out of La Sante prison on Wednesday 
a free man, hours after a French appeals court rejected a request 
by Britain to extradite the one-time spy. David Shayler, 32, faced 
being charged under Britain's Official Secrets Acts and up to two 
years in prison if he had been deported by French authorities who 
had arrested him on Aug. 1 at Scotland Yard's request. Instead, the 
court ordered Shayler freed from La Sante prison in southern Paris, 
judicial sources said. Shayler's two brothers hugged him as Shayler 
emerged from the prison carrying two cardboard boxes with his personal 
belongings. ``I am glad to be out of prison. I shouldn't have had 
to spend four months in prison for criticizing MI5,'' he said. ``It's 
a very happy day for me and for civil liberties and a very sad and 
embarrassing one for MI5 and the government.'' The former spy admitted 
that he sold information on Britain's MI5 domestic intelligence agency 
to a London newspaper for 20,000 pounds (dlrs 33,400). At the time 
of his arrest, Home Secretary Jack Straw said that Shayler had access 
to highly sensitive information. The French court's decision for letting 
Shayler go was not made public, nor it's reason for doing so. Shayler's 
lawyers argued that the British extradition request had a ``political 
character'' and was therefore prohibited under French law. The French 
government cannot go against a court ruling and order Shayler to be 
turned over to the British. Shayler was arrested in France after he 
reportedly considered releasing information about an alleged British 
plot to kill Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, which the British government 
denies. Shayler worked for MI5 internal security service from 1994 
until 1997. He fled to France last year after selling stories about 
the agency's operations to a British newspaper. Libya also had asked 
France to extradite Shayler, or to allow Libyan judicial authorities 
to question him in France. Until his arrest, Shayler had been living 
with his girlfriend in a remote part of rural France. In London, the 
Home Office said it was up to French prosecutors to decide whether 
to further appeal the court ruling. The British Government would be 
keeping in close touch with French authorities, said a spokeswoman.
