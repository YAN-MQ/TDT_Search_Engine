Given the language of the law, guilt was ordained. The four high school 
seniors charged with having sexual relations with three 14-year-old 
freshmen girls had committed statutory rape, and the prosecutor was 
only doing the state's duty in enforcing the law. But ``Cry Rape,'' 
Thursday night's ``48 Hours,'' gives a more nuanced account of the 
events that led these young men and women (boys and girls?) into the 
situation that damaged them all. As reported by Bill Lagattuta, the 
case offers a glimpse of sex conventions at Grosse Point North High 
School in Michigan. A swinging set of seniors in this upscale community 
appears to have been competing to see how many virgins they could 
bring to bed before graduation. The three girls in question succumbed, 
how voluntarily remains at issue. Two of them say they were, to use 
the melodramatic language that seems to suit the offense, plied with 
alcohol and then forced to submit to sex. But the evidence suggests 
a degree of compliancy if not complicity; they evidently returned 
for more of the same. Apparently, little sympathy for them has been 
forthcoming from the community. The third girl, who still harbors 
warm feelings for her main seducer, says, no, the sex was not forced; 
on the other hand, it was not exactly consensual. She says, ``It was, 
like, sex.'' Of the participants in the episode, she seems to be the 
frankest about her confused feelings. ``I still think guys are hot,'' 
she says. The picture presented is of teen-age partying, no physical 
force required, with a mix of alcohol, desires and easy opportunities. 
Everybody in this privileged group was fooling around. If one is inclined 
to be judgmental, the seniors, big men on campus, were predators; 
the girls were flattered to be selected for the attentions of such 
important social figures. As the prosecutor holds, 14-year-olds, whatever 
their own silliness or because of it, should be protected even against 
17- or 18-year-olds, and the law calls the offense statutory rape. 
Few viewers are likely to leave ``Cry Rape'' with any particular admiration 
for the young men. (One says the girls forced themselves on him.) 
Yet you may feel that significant elements of the story could never 
be sorted out in a courtroom. For example, we meet the parents of 
one of the young men and two of the girls; they seem not to have had 
a clue about what their children were up to. In the school, these 
youngsters were leaders, trend-setters, and, as at least one of them 
recognizes, they were very much part of a culture that celebrates 
youthful sex. The wonder is that many more of the students didn't 
find themselves in trouble. The program ends with the main protagonist, 
a sometime class president and valedictorian, being sentenced to jail 
for a few months. The law requires it; he has earned it. But the debt 
he is paying resolves little about how he and the others got into 
this fix. What ``Cry Rape'' suggests is that when this sort of sexual 
assault _ insofar as it can be called assault _ becomes a case at 
law, punishment is much more common than insight. BROADCAST NOTES:
