Meanwhile, rival Sudanese rebels have taken their dispute to neighboring 
Kenya. Sonya Lawrence, Sonya Lawrence Green, rather, reports that 
each accuses the other of plotting mischief this week in Nairobi. 
Rival rebel commanders in South Sudan, Kerobino Quanyan Boll and John 
Gurang, appear to be locked in a new battle. This time, a war of words 
set in Kenya's capital, Nairobi. Major General Kerobino, leader of 
renegade rebel force that operates in parts of south Sudan, says that 
members of John Gurang's mainstream SPLA rebels harassed him in Kenya, 
searched his residence, and helped orchestrate his arrest late last 
week. But the SPLA says that is nonsense. It categorically denies 
harassing Mr. Kerobino. It says Kenyan police searched Mr. Kerobino's 
home looking for guns and radio equipment and that only Kenyan police 
could make any related arrests. In fact, the SPLA says it was Mr. 
Kerobino who was up to no good. It says Mr. Kerobino tried to assassinate 
SPLA leader, John Gurang, at his home in Nairobi over the weekend, 
but failed. It says a hit squad of 20 men attacked Mr. Gurang's home. 
After Kenyan police intervened, some ran to the SPLA offices to loot 
equipment, but a local Kenyan vigilante group came to the aid of the 
night watchman there. The SPLA says that Mr. Kerobino's gang of terrorists 
has assistance from Sudan's government through its embassy in Kenya. 
Sudan's government denies any links to terrorism abroad. But the fact 
that all these Sudanese talks and accusations have emerged in Kenya 
was perhaps inevitable. Since all factions of Sudan's 15 year civil 
war have offices in Nairobi, within a few miles of each other. Sudan's 
bitter civil war has dragged on since 1983. Southern rebels are fighting 
the northern Arabai government, demanding more autonomy and religious 
freedom for the south. But the rebels have split, formed alliances, 
and counter-alliances so many times that he war has turned into something 
of a deadly stalemate. Sonya Lawrence Green for VOA News, Nairobi.
