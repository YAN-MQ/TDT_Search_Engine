Actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas is trading "home improvement" for homework. 
Thomas says no one is complaining about his decision to leave the 
hit TV show, so he can concentrate on his junior year in high school. 
It will be written into the show that his character, Randy, is leaving 
to pursue his interest in the environment. Thomas will bow out after 
the show's Christmas episode.
