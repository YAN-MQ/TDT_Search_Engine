The referee's committee of football's World Governing Body has decided 
to appoint only women referees for the 1999 Women's World Cup in the 
United States. The committee complied with a suggestion from FIFA 
President, Seth Bladder, for the tournament which would be played 
from June 19 to July 10. FIFA also plans to hold a workshop for 15 
female referees and 16 assistants that will be held prior to the tournament. 
The workshop will be modeled after the program for the male referees 
chosen for the 1998 World Cup in France. The committee came to the 
conclusion that more attention needs to be paid to the psychological 
well being of the referees. They also suggested that more sophisticated 
means should be used to assess the official's performance.
