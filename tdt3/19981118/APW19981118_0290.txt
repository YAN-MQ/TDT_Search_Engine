Romanian president, Emil Constantinescu, arrived in Sarajevo Wednesday, 
on his first official visit to Bosnia since the two Balkan countries 
established diplomatic relations last year. In the Bosnian capital, 
Constantinescu met the three-member Bosnian joint presidency and was 
scheduled to visit commanders of the NATO-led peace force stationed 
in the country. Following a 1992-95 war, Bosnia was divided into the 
Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic. A strong international 
presence has helped return the country to stability. Later Wednesday, 
Constantinescu is to travel to central Bosnian town of Zenica to visit 
Romanian soldiers serving in the peace force.
