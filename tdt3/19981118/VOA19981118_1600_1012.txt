This is the Voice of America coming to you from Washington. I am Erin 
Brummet with Tony Riggs, bringing you this hour of VOA News Now. At 
21 hours, 18 universal time, here are our leading headlines. President 
Clinton, departing for a trip to Asia, has called on Japan to take 
decisive steps to repair its economy saying the key to recovery in 
the region lies with Japan. Mr. Clinton said he also looks forward 
to talks with South Korean leader, Kim Dae-Jung, on joint security 
concerns about North Korea's nuclear program. We will have more on 
that and the rest of the hour's top news in our next summary about 
12 minutes from now.
