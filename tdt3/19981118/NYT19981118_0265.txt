Given Livent Inc.'s financial predicament, filing for bankruptcy protection 
_ a step taken Wednesday after much agonizing _ may in some ways be 
the best thing that could have happened to it. With a mountain of 
debt, its stock frozen and shareholders clamoring for redress, Chapter 
11 reorganization buys the troubled company behind the musical ``Ragtime'' 
breathing space to try to get its house in order and keep its creditors 
at bay. And although the Toronto-based Livent canceled the remainder 
of the ``Ragtime'' road tour Wednesday, it appears that its new works-in-progress 
have enough money to proceed as planned. These include ``Parade,'' 
a new musical jointly produced by Lincoln Center Theater that is now 
in previews and ``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance,'' due to 
open on Broadway in January. But Livent's raising of the financial 
white flag also underscores larger questions about the future viability 
of a company that helped define the outer reaches of theater extravagance 
and about whether there are cautionary lessons for the rest of Broadway. 
Did Livent go too far in trying to promote shows like ``Ragtime'' 
and ``Showboat'' and quickly clone road companies around the country? 
Should the fall of Garth Drabinsky, Livent's former creative director, 
serve as an object lesson in the pitfalls of lavish producing? Or 
are Livent's travails simply the result of one renegade impresario 
run amok? ``I think he was a special case,'' said Jujamcyn Theaters 
president Rocco Landesman. ``Garth lived on Fantasy Island all those 
years and still does. I don't think he was ever realistic about how 
he was going to recover expenditures he made. Too much was not enough, 
that was the motto.'' Indeed, most Broadway producers say they saw 
this coming, that with running frequent expensive full-page ads in 
The New York Times and the costly refurbishing of the Ford Center 
for the Performing Arts, Livent was clearly heading for a fall. But 
they also say Drabinsky deserves credit for trying to redefine Broadway, 
for attempting a new financial construct _ raising capital internally 
as a public company rather than tapping individual investors _ and 
for creating fireworks in the theater. ``Garth has contributed excitement, 
and flamboyant showmanship, and true detail to the creative process,'' 
said veteran Broadway producer Alexander H. Cohen. ``It is unfortunate, 
however, that he didn't seem to have a close enough eye to the costs.'' 
It isn't just that Drabinsky spent too much, producers say, it's that 
he tried a different model of fund-raising that was ultimately flawed. 
In what he called ``vertical integration,'' Drabinsky wanted to bring 
all the producing functions inside the company, including investment. 
But because theater has historically been a risky investment at best, 
the strategy proved misguided. ``Between 15 and 20 percent of shows 
recoup their investment, so why would you want to set up a structure 
where you did 100 percent of investing in your own shows?'' Landesman 
said. ``Producers for 50 years have known better. That's why they 
go out and raise money. The model was illogical.'' Bernard Gersten, 
the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, which is splitting 
the cost of the $5.2 million ``Parade'' _ now in previews _ with Livent, 
said Drabinsky's approach could not be so easily dismissed. ``He changed 
the rules in an interesting way,'' Gersten said. ``He did it the way 
auto companies do, he raised capital and he put on shows. The problem 
is, it was predicated upon on an unreasonable requirement that you 
produce hits in the theater.'' So far, Livent's current projects seem 
protected. Gersten said the company had met all of its obligations 
on ``Parade'' except paying a reserve against possible losses during 
previews, which is due Nov. 30. ``I expect that payment will be made 
in a timely fashion,'' Gersten said. ``Fosse'' is currently being 
performed in Los Angeles and is due to begin previews in New York 
next month. Tuesday, Livent held a workshop in Manhattan of ``Sweet 
Smell of Success,'' a new musical with music by Marvin Hamlisch and 
a book by John Guare. And ``Ragtime'' led Broadway grosses last week, 
with reported sales of $848,825, according to Variety. In addition, 
people in the theater expressed confidence in the company's new management 
_ namely Michael Ovitz, the former president of Walt Disney Co. who 
controls Livent's board, and Roy Furman, the chairman and chief executive 
_ even though the officers failed to identify financial irregularities 
when they took over the company last spring. ``I'm sure they'll come 
out of this with great success,'' said David Richenthal, a producer 
who said he has discussed the possibility of future projects with 
Furman and Livent's artistic director, Todd Haimes. ``They both have 
great theater judgment and great business judgment and they have enormous 
credibility in the industry.'' If anything, some producers said, seeking 
Chapter 11 protection was long overdue. ``The only mistake Furman 
and Ovitz made was not doing this sooner,'' Landesman said. ``This 
is not `The Producers' with Mel Brooks,'' added Cohen. ``This seems 
to me to be a time for the company to emerge stronger. I think they'll 
be able to attract new investors through the offices of Mr. Furman 
and Mr. Ovitz, who are plenty experienced in raising money. I am totally 
unconcerned.'' Nevertheless, questions remain, particularly given 
that Livent has at this point canceled the last two cities on its 
``Ragtime'' tour _ Boston and Seattle _ although the cast and crew 
will finish the run in Minneapolis. Will Livent continue to support 
its Chicago company of ``Ragtime,'' its touring company of ``Showboat'' 
and its Toronto production of ``Phantom of the Opera''? The company 
recently dropped plans to develop the historic Times Square Theater 
on 42nd Street and canceled plans for a new 1,400-seat theater in 
downtown Toronto. And its Ford Centers in Toronto and Vancouver are 
reportedly struggling to attract audiences. Will Ovitz and his team 
ultimately determine that Livent is not worth saving and simply decide 
to sell? What will be the result of investigations by securities regulators 
in the United States and Canada, where the company is based, into 
the company's books? Or the outcome of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police's criminal investigation? Livent's stock has not traded on 
exchanges in the United States or Canada since Aug. 10, when the company 
announced that it had discovered millions of dollars in accounting 
errors and suspended Drabinsky, along with the company's co-founder, 
Myron Gottlieb. Wednesday, Livent dismissed Drabinsky and Gottlieb 
as employees and asked for their resignations as directors. Both men 
refused to resign. Livent also filed a lawsuit against them alleging 
breach of contract and fraud among other things. The lawsuit, filed 
in Toronto, seeks $64.5 million from each man, $9.6 million from a 
company Gottlieb controlled and $6.4 million in punitive damages from 
the two men and that company. Meanwhile, Drabinsky and Gottlieb, who 
have denied any wrongdoing, are back in an an office in Toronto about 
two blocks from Livent's headquarters under MyGar Partnership, their 
former corporate name. Indeed, some suggest that Broadway may not 
have seen the end of Drabinsky, or at least that his impact will be 
lasting. ``He may have been ahead of his time,'' Gersten said. ``And 
maybe what he set out to do will be accomplished at a later moment 
by someone else who will be more thoughtful and more careful.''
