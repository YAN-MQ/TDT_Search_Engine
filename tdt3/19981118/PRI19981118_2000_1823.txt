For The World, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom, in London. 
President Clinton says the world is still looking to Japan to take 
decisive steps to help restore growth in Asia. He made his comments 
before leaving for Tokyo, the first stop on a five-day Asian tour. 
Richard Lister reports. Despite the recent stimulus packages unveiled 
by Japan, Washington's view is that it could do better. President 
Clinton has spoken frequently about the need to reform the Japanese 
economy, in order to revitalize the region as a whole. He sent the 
Prime Minister Kazuo Obuchi a letter last week, making the point that 
further stimulus was still needed. Speaking before his departure for 
Tokyo, President Clinton said US exports were already beginning to 
suffer from the weakened Asian economy. And that Japan was the key 
to recovery. Richard Lister, BBC News, Washington.
