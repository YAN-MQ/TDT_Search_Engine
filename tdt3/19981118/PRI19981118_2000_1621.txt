Monthly trade figures released today, in Washington, show the United 
States still imports more than it exports. But after the trade gap 
reached record levels in August, it narrowed in September. The World's 
Liz George tells us what it all means, in this report from our Business 
Desk in New York. America's current account is in the red now, by 
just over $14 billion. And although figures released today show that 
US exports are increasing, imports from other countries are still 
arriving in high numbers. And economists are warning, many of the 
problems in overseas markets, which led to the ballooning deficit 
in the first place, are still there. Kevin Flannagan is the First 
Vice President with Morgan Stanley Dean-Witter. Given the situation 
you are still seeing in many of the markets abroad for US based goods, 
the trade deficit for the US will continue to widen as you approach 
the end of this year and early 1999. What impact is that having on 
our in-home markets? It's having a very significant impact, especially 
on manufacturing. A lot of the talk early on, with the difficulties 
in Japan and some of the other emerging market economies, was that 
the US would receive a flood tide of imports. We have seen import 
totals rise, but the key is on the export side. And that's what's 
most important for manufacturing. We're seeing markets for US based 
goods drying up. For the last nine months, we've actually seen a drop 
of about 190 to 195,000 workers in manufacturing. Economists are predicting 
that the deficit is going to be enormous by the end of this year. 
Is that your view? Yes, well the way we would look at it is, right 
now you are dealing with a $14-15 billion figure. We would say that 
by year end we wouldn't be surprised to see something in the $19-20 
billion range. One of the factors boosting exports from the US this 
month, was the record number of civilian aircraft sales abroad. On 
the other hand, America is still buying more from China than anywhere 
else in the world. This month the numbers reflect, in part, large 
shipments of toys ahead of the Christmas season. For The World, I'm 
Liz George, in New York.
