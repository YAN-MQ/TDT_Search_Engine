Both the winners and losers emphasized teamwork today as house republicans 
got their leadership elections out of the way. Louisiana congressman 
Bob Livingston is the republican candidate for house speaker. He ran 
unopposed and was approved by voice vote. He must still be formally 
elected by the entire house when the new Congress convenes. I now 
greet you as the republican nominee for the speaker of the House of 
Representatives, the third ranking constitutional slot in the United 
States of America. And that humbles me, beyond all doubt.
