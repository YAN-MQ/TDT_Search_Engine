But first the latest from Washington. White House lawyers are crying 
foul over tomorrow's impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. 
They accuse the house Judiciary committee of partisanship, saying 
the process clearly favors republicans. The main sticking point involves 
independent counsel Ken Starr. White House lawyers object to the fact 
Starr will get to make a two-hour uninterrupted presentation, while 
presidential lawyers have only 30 minutes for cross-examination. Democrats 
are also upset at reports Starr might discuss matters outside of the 
Monica Lewinsky matter. Although the republicans have talked about 
being bipartisan, and the independent counsel has talked about his 
independence, we seem to see a Situation now where they're walking 
in lockstep. Where the republicans say that they're about to expand 
this probe, and then we see in the paper that the independent counsel 
is about to expand his statement. The republicans should be working 
in a bipartisan way and the independent counsel should be truly independent. 
He should not be working with the republicans on this.
