Tonight, "the fleecing of America." When was the last time you took 
a close look at your phone Bill? With phone use so heavy in almost 
every household, the bills often run to pages and the details can 
be mind-boggling so, understandably, a lot of people just go to the 
bottom line and pay the charges. But guess what? A new scam adds up 
to a "fleecing of America." Here's NBC's Mike Jensen. You're probably 
1 of 100 million Americans who get a phone Bill every month. But do 
you really know what's in it? Page after page of local charges, long 
distance charges, and sometimes, mystery charges with vague descriptions. 
But many of those charges are fake, for services and items you never 
wanted, never ordered, never received. Patricia Stark. They soaked 
me for almost $11.00, $12.00 each month. how? It's a new, nationwide 
scam called "telephone cramming," not by the phone company, but by 
rip-off artists who have recently figured out how to use loopholes 
in the law to cram their phony charges onto your Bill. How do the 
scammers get access to your phone Bill? For Patricia Stark and thousands 
of others, authorities say the cramming trap was set at this county 
fair in upstate New York. It started innocently, when they filled 
out sweepstakes forms distributed by an organization called veterans 
of America association. But, not only did they not win a prize, they 
ended up with a new charge on their phone Bill. Because on the sweepstakes 
form, in the fine print, was this statement. That they were actually 
joining the veterans of America association. Also in the fine print, 
that a membership fee would show up on their telephone Bill as a voice 
mail charge. New York state sued the veterans of America association. 
They duped nearly,000 New Yorkers by this device and scam. The association 
says it was a mistake by a promotion firm. And denies any wrongdoing. 
The case is pending. Some crammers have been shut down. More than 
50 in the northeast alone. What can you do to avoid being crammed? 
First, read the fine print on everything you sign. Then, at home, 
study your phone Bill. Check out any charges you don't understand. 
Otherwise, you may join tens of thousands of Americans being ripped 
off in this latest "fleecing of America." Mike Jensen, NBC news, New 
York.
