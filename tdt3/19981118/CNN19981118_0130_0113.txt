they were conversations monica lewinsky thought were private -- conversations 
that may or may not have been recorded legally. regardless, the house 
judiciary committee released 22 hours of recorded phone conversations 
between lewinsky and linda tripp on tuesday. although the transcripts 
were released last month. this is the first time much of the public 
has heard her voice. the tapes include lewinsky talking in detail 
about her relationship with president clinton. in one excerpt she 
is so upset she breaks down in tears. it's just -- i go to work every 
day and i just -- i'm trying to keep it together and i just can't. 
you've been a trooper through this monica, and you've been through 
-- -- a situation that most full grown adult women couldn't handle. 
okay? sorry, i mean this is ridiculous. another recording includes 
a discussion about lewinsky's subpoena in the paula jones case. maybe 
i should just tell the creep, maybe i should just say, "look, don't 
ever talk to me again, it's over. and for now you have this information, 
and do whatever you want with." no, i think -- i think if you want 
to do that -- that's what i would do, but i don't know that you're 
comfortable with that. i think he should know. he won't settle, he's 
in denial. nothing is -- i think if he knew he would settle. i don't 
think so, because he knows that it will just end up being me against 
you. i don't think. i don't want to paint you as a bad person. look, 
monica, we already know that you're gonna lie under oath. we also 
know that i want out of this big time. i mean, how else is this gonna 
go? if i have to testify -- if i am forced to answer questions and 
i answer truthfully, it's gonna be the opposite of what you say. so 
therefore, it's a conflict right there. the white house is dismissing 
the tapes. press secretary joe lockhart says he thinks most people 
will ignore them because the transcripts were released six weeks ago. 
but he says people obsessed with the scandal will be in heaven.
