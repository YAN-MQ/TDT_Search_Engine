Bryan Cox, who has launched himself into the upper echelon of New 
York Jets defenders with his recent play, wiped that off-the-field 
smile off his face Wednesday. The linebacker was thinking of Steve 
McNair, the scrambling Tennessee Oilers quarterback the Jets face 
on Sunday. Both American Conference clubs are 6-4, and this could 
be a game that helps determine a wild-card berth for either team. 
But the immediate problem is McNair, who earned the nickname Air in 
college for his outstanding passing at Alcorn State and is now also 
running at a gaudy 8.2 yards a carry. ``I get angry,'' said the excitable 
Cox, ``when I run all that way and then just as I'm about to tackle 
him, the quarterback slides. I'm teed off that I wasted all that energy.'' 
For defensive tackle Jason Ferguson, the husky McNair's running ability 
``is like having Eddie George back there running the ball.'' Actually, 
the Oilers also have George back there. George, in his third year, 
has amassed 953 rushing yards. He is on the hottest tear of any running 
back in the National Football League. Over the last six games, he 
is averaging 121.8 yards a game. The tandem has coalesced in the last 
three games, all victories, including two over the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
The team has generated 94 points in the span. The 6-foot 2-inch, 225-pound 
McNair is completing passes at a 61.5 percent rate and has tossed 
11 touchdowns to only 7 interceptions. ``I don't think a lot of people 
realized this about McNair,'' said Oilers coach Jeff Fisher. ``But 
as a junior, he was a pocket passer. As a senior, he used four wide 
receivers in an open game. We wouldn't have drafted him if he wasn't 
a good pocket passer.'' This is McNair's fourth season with the Oilers, 
and second as a starter. It surprises people to learn that for at 
least one year he played in a pro-type offense in college, where he 
tossed 530 career passes. ``This is a lot different,'' he said Wednesday. 
``In college I was throwing a lot. Here, there's a balanced attack.'' 
He is a major part of that balance with his running, which includes 
the Oilers' longest score of the season, a 71-yard scramble. He has 
run 37 times and has scored three touchdowns, as many on the ground 
as George. But McNair knows he must also be practical when he picks 
up running yardage. Did he ever forget to slide? ``There are times 
when you try to make more yards on third down,'' he said. Perhaps 
the Nashville fans are getting accustomed, indeed looking forward 
to, this improving team. In five home games this year, Vanderbilt's 
41,000-seat stadium has been sold out only twice. The Oilers were 
8-8 last season, when they played in Memphis but practiced in Nashville. 
In 1996, the team played in Houston. Next year, they will be moving 
into a new, as-yet unnamed stadium that will hold 67,000 fans. ``That 
will be our fourth stadium in four years,'' said Fisher. ``Things 
are settling down,'' said the coach, who can finally play home games 
at home. Last year, the Oilers flew to all 16 games, including the 
eight they played at ``home'' in Memphis. Still, George said ``it'll 
take a few years for people to get used to having an NFL team in Tennessee.'' 
And he's not happy with the artificial turf at Vanderbilt, which he 
described as ``hard on your body.'' Next year, meanwhile, the team 
won't even be the Oilers any longer. They will be the Titans, which 
just happens to be the Jets' original name. But the Tennessee Titans 
got their name, said their owner, Bud Adams, because Nashville is 
known as the Athens of the South. Adams noted that one nickname the 
team didn't want involved snakes or reptiles. ``That eliminated Copperheads 
and Vipers,'' said Adams. ``My apologies to the herpetologists.'' 
EXTRA POINTS _ The Jets' loss to the Colts is still galling. The Jets 
produced so many positive offensive and special-teams plays, yet lost 
by a point. ``In all the years I've played,'' said quarterback VINNY 
TESTAVERDE, ``this is the toughest game I've had trouble putting behind 
me. But in order to win the next game, we've got to put it behind 
us.'' _ At least one Oilers starter, safety BLAINE BISHOP, is out, 
having suffered a knee injury. Another, wide receiver YANCEY THIGPEN, 
is listed at 50-50 to return from a knee injury, which has kept him 
out of the last three games. _ AARON GLENN is the American Conference's 
special-teams player of the week for his league-record 104-yard touchdown 
return of a Colts field-goal attempt.
