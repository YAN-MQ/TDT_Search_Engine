satellite operators say most of the leonid meteor storm has passed. 
the skies over japan were filled with light as debris moved through 
earth's atmosphere. so far, none of the 600 satellites orbiting earth 
has been damaged by the meteor pieces. nasa rotated the hubble space 
telescope so that any particles would hit its heavily protected back
