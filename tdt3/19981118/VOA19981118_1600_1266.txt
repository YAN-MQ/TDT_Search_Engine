Meanwhile, in the Rough Arena, Scott Hatchett scored 21 points and 
grabbed 12 rebounds as the Kentucky Wildcats rolled over EKU 99-64. 
Number five, Maryland, scored its 60th straight home victory against 
a non-conference opponent, beating UMBC, 90-62. The eighth-ranked 
Kentucky or Kansas Jayhawks, that is, scored a win over Pennsylvania, 
61-56. Kansas coach, Roy Williams, says Penn played Kansas tough. 
I knew Penn would play our tails off and the first half was about 
as ugly as I can ever remember a team playing. Somebody told me it 
was the fewest points we have scored in the half since I have been 
there. And shot 27 percent so that has got to be close as bad as it 
can be, but we were bad and yet, give Penn credit for causing a lot 
of that, too. It is not just a one-way street out there. And the Tennessee 
Volunteers, behind 19 points, but behind Brandon Wharton scored an 
83-64 over Cal State Northridge. Other games Savier, beat Butler, 
73-66. Michigan State over Oakland, 96-66. And Arkansas over Alabama 
State, 73-43. That's sports, I am Steve Shine.
