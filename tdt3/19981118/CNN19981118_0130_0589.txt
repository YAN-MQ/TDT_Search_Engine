scientists say a discovery in argentina will provide new information 
about the development and reproductive strategies of dinosaurs. aram 
roston looks at what they've found. in rough argentinean terrain, 
scientists say they've found a giant prehistoric nesting site of dinosaurs 
-- thousands of grapefruit-sized dinosaur eggs more than 70 million 
years old. inside some of those eggs, scientists say they found fossilized 
dinosaur embryos. they would have grown to approximately 40 to 50 
feet in length when adult. these were the eggs of sauropods, the massive 
plant-eating dinosaurs depicted in "jurassic park." sauropods were 
the largest dinosaurs. this is the first time any confirmed sauropod 
egg has been found. this is also the first time scientists have recovered 
fossilized skin of dinosaur embryos. lowell dingus, one of the scientists 
involved in the find, has been fascinated by dinosaurs since he was 
in kindergarten. he says flooding may have covered the giant nesting 
fields in silt. it was really those flood events that probably -- 
although unfortunate for the little embryos, was a real fortunate 
event for us -- because by burying the embryos and the eggs quickly, 
it allowed them to be preserved. and through some means, that we're 
not entirely sure about the process, preserved even the soft tissues. 
scientists believe sauropods were social and traveled in herds and 
came repeatedly to the same nesting grounds to lay their eggs. aram
