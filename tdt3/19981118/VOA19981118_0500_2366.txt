Indonesia's military has published newspaper advertisements to apologize 
for the deaths of at least 14 people during clashes last week between 
police and antigovernment demonstrators in Jakarta. It was the worst 
unrest since riots last May helped topple, then President Suharto. 
Clashes broke out when thousands of protesters advocating swift democratic 
change, tried to march on the Indonesian parliament building. Where 
a special assembly was deliberating political reform. Police fired 
rubber bullets at the crowd.
