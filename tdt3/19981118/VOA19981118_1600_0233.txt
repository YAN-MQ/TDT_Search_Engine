Top Israeli and Palestinian officials met in Jerusalem Wednesday for 
their first discussion in more than two years on the final status 
issues of the peace process. VOA's David Gulles reports Abass, a top 
aid to Yasser Arafat, is the most senior Palestinian official to visit 
Israel's foreign ministry compound. And with reporters present for 
the opening of the meeting, he had an amiable exchange with Foreign 
Minister, Areal Sherone, who said the talks were not about the bitter 
history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. We are not going to talk 
about what happened in the past. I think we are looking forward to 
see how to be able to find a way for a lasting peace in the Middle 
East. The final status talks expected to convene in full sessions 
later this month will deal with the most difficult issues of the peace 
process. Including Jerusalem, the future of Jewish settlements in 
Palestinian areas, and the question of Palestinian statehood. David 
Gulles, VOA News, Jerusalem.
