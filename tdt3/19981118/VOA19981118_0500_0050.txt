I am Becky Bailey, VOA News. UN arms inspectors are back at work in 
Iraq one day after returning to Baghdad following the latest crisis 
that nearly led to U.S. Air Strikes. Chief weapons inspector, Richard 
Butler, was asked when he thinks the next crisis will be. That is 
Iraq's call. They can choose between never having one again, by cooperating 
with us. Or they can have one tomorrow, if they decide to block us. 
The inspectors are expected to check long-term monitoring equipment 
at various sites as they begin to test monitors and Iraq's promise 
of unconditional cooperation. But UN officials said the crucial test 
would come when surprise searches for hidden weapons are carried out 
at new sites.
