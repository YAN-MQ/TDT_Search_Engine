Now to our special series with "the Wall Street Journal" -- "bitter 
pill." All this week, together with "the journal," we're looking at 
the high cost of prescription drugs. Tonight, generic drugs. They're 
supposed to be a more affordable alternative to brand names. But it 
doesn't always turn out that way. Here's NBC's Anne Thompson. Joyce 
cook slashes her prescription Bill in half every month, taking a generic 
drug to treat her high blood pressure. The medicine is working. Generics 
make up almost half of the prescriptions written in this country. 
And yet they account for only one-tenth the money spent on drugs. 
One reason -- generics are so much cheaper. But another reason, drug 
companies fighting hard to keep their lock on a Lucrative market. 
And that means you may not always get the best deal. The major difference 
between a brand name and a generic is price. Comparisons -- feldene, 
the popular brand name arthritis drug, 16 times more expensive than 
the generic. Glucotrol, for diabetes, eight times more than the generic. 
Isoptin, for hypertension and arrhythmia, twice the price of the generic. 
So you'd think generics would be everywhere. But they're not, because 
pharmaceutical companies are doing everything they can to keep you 
and your doctor loyal to their more expensive brands. Big company 
sales reps bombard doctors, like Matt sorrentino, with free products 
and perks. I have a feeling there are not a lot of drug reps from 
the generic companies, so we don't have a lot of exposure to them. 
Another tactic -- politics. Du Pont makes the blood thinner coumadin, 
bringing in up to $550 million a Year. It's a wonderful drug when 
managed appropriately. It can be very dangerous if it's used cavalierly. 
Du Pont says switching from the brand name to the generic, warfarin, 
made by Barr laboratories, can confuse patients and put them at risk 
for bleeding or strokes. So du Pont asked 20 state governments to 
require pharmacists to get doctor's approval before making the switch 
to the generic. Its rival, Barr, says it's an unnecessary step designed 
to protect market share instead of patients. We've had a very difficult 
fight with them all across the country. a product the food and drug 
administration says is just as good as the brand name. And based on 
our evidence, we think they're interchangeable products. More than 
70% of all drugs have a generic counterpart, but if you want to save 
money, like Joyce cook, you may have to look harder and ask your doctor 
whether a generic is right for you. Anne Thompson, NBC news, Chicago.
