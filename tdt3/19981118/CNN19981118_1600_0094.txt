President Clinton is on his way to Asia with hopes of reviving economies 
there. His first stop is Japan. Mr. Clinton says nothing is more important 
to restoring stability in the region than restoring the Japanese economy. 
And he says the United States can help do that. The president's five-day 
trip comes on the heels of the apec summit. Vice President Gore attended 
in place of Mr. Clinton, who was delayed because of the Iraq standoff.
