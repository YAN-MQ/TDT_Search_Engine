Farmers sent police on a wild pig chase Wednesday as they staged a 
second protest to demand tighter restrictions on pork imports and 
increased government aid. The farmers _ calling themselves the ``Movement 
of Bankrupt Farmers'' _ released some 90 pigs at main avenues in Lisbon 
and two inland cities before daybreak causing traffic havoc. In Leiria, 
some 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of the capital Lisbon, the animals 
had the words ``Hunger'' and ``Misery'' written across their backs 
while farmers also distributed pamphlets demanding that ``the government 
feed (the pigs). We no longer can,'' the national news agency Lusa 
reported. A spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry said the government 
was working on a solution to meet the farmers' demands, but gave no 
details. The movement staged its first protest Saturday, setting dozens 
of squealing pigs loose outside the Agriculture Ministry, in Lisbon. 
Most of the pigs were rounded up by police Wednesday although two 
were killed when they were accidentally run over by farmers. Pork 
farmers have also held protests in France and Spain this month to 
denounce plunging prices and demand more government aid.
