A Paris court on Wednesday threw out a lawsuit by actor Alain Delon 
who was trying to ban publication of a still unwritten unauthorized 
biography. Delon, not present at Wednesday's hearing, won a temporary 
court order in August to have the planned biography by Bernard Violet 
banned pending further hearings. Delon was also seeking 400,000 francs 
(dlrs 71,400) in damages. But Wednesday's court ruling said a ban 
on an unwritten work would run contrary to freedom of expression. 
It said that the final contents of the book ``remained uncertain.'' 
A French magazine in August published court papers citing a synopsis 
of the book, prompting Delon to seek a court order to remove the magazine 
_ Marianne _ from newsstands. He failed. Delon, who has seen the book 
synopsis, accused the author of being a ``spelunker of the garbage 
can'' in his bid to get information for the book. Among the details 
in Marianne were Delon's alleged youthful dalliances with other actors 
or actresses and reported ties to shady politicians, mafia figures 
and mercenaries. The book's publisher, Editions Grasset, had criticized 
the original court ban, complaining of creeping censorship. It had 
no immediate comment Wednesday on the court ruling. Now 63, Delon 
was for decades a dashing screen idol in dozens of movies including 
``The Leopard'' and ``Rocco and his Brothers.'' Violet, a former reporter 
for French television, has written 10 other investigative books. Among 
them: biographies of the terrorist Carlos, convicted Vichy official 
Maurice Papon, oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, and a look at France's 
secret services under the late President Francois Mitterrand.
