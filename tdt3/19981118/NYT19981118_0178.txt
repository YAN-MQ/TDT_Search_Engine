When you're president of a co-op board, the complaints just flood 
in. ``It's always the little stuff, like the complaint last week about 
a guy who goes out in the hall every morning to get his paper _ wearing 
nothing but a cowboy hat,'' said Sylvia Shapiro, board president, 
lawyer and author of ``The Co-Op Bible'' (St. Martin's Press), a new 
book subtitled ``Getting In, Staying In, Surviving, Thriving.'' Ms. 
Shapiro, a stylish woman of 48 with dark hair combed straight up, 
seems to be thriving in her own red-brick postwar ``cond-op'' (a New 
York City invention: half condo, half co-op) at Broadway and 9th Street. 
Her apartment, a duplex penthouse she obtained ``through horse-trading 
and stealth maneuvering'' (see the introduction to the book) just 
as the building was converting from rentals in 1990, is immaculately 
appointed in a combination of Empire chaises covered in claret-colored 
silk and a lot of Egyptian revival chairs she found in Cairo. Her 
own building, she said, has few major squabbles. Yes, there is the 
fellow in the cowboy hat. ``I haven't witnessed the spectacle myself, 
so the matter is pending,'' she said. ``Then there was all that hate 
mail about the lack of lights on our Christmas tree,'' she said ruefully. 
Ms. Shapiro has very definite tastes _ this is clear from her apartment 
_ and she deplored ``those tacky plastic ornaments we had.'' Aided 
by the building superintendent, she hunted down antique mercury glass 
balls. ``We called stores as far as Texas,'' she said. She considered 
the effect ``splendid and elegant.'' Still the complaints came: where 
were the lights? ``We also had a plastic wreath,'' she recalled. ``We'd 
just renovated the lobby, and I didn't want to put nails in the new 
walls to hang it up.'' Well, Ms. Shapiro lost on the lights: this 
Christmas, there will be strings of pure white bulbs. But she won 
big on the wreath. ``I got some designer topiary poinsettias,'' she 
said, smiling brightly through her very red lipstick. With such attention 
to detail, it's not surprising that Ms. Shapiro devotes a big section 
of her book, an $18.95 paperback, to advising co-op shareholders how 
to navigate board restrictions on renovations. One tip: Gain the neighbors' 
approval for any makeover in advance. And get all board approvals 
in writing, even for minor changes. At some point in the legal-limbo 
nether region between her occupancy of the penthouse as a renter and 
her occupancy as an owner, Ms. Shapiro, it seems, embarked on a big 
renovation. In a subchapter titled ``Getting Away With Murder,'' she 
tells how she began ripping up the apartment in what she calls ``not 
an act of defiance but of ignorance.'' After she became president, 
she says, she learned better. Although the book is full of legal advice 
_ with only a few legalisms _ Ms. Shapiro, in her writing as well 
as her conversation, likes to take chances. After a lengthy discourse 
in her book on what to do if you are rejected by a co-op _ if disappointed 
applicants suspect discrimination, they can turn to state or municipal 
human-rights agencies _ she concludes the chapter with what she now 
calls tongue-in-cheek advice. ``None of these strategies seem like 
sure-fire winners?'' she asks. ``Why not try a new approach calculated 
to hit board members where it hurts (their egos) and sure to bring 
instant attention to the cause?'' Only half-kidding, Ms. Shapiro counsels 
readers who consider themselves to be victims of co-op board harassment 
to take their cause to the news media. If that's not your style, she 
says, ``slap on a placard or hand out leaflets in the street in front 
of the building.'' Ms. Shapiro's career, although eccentric, reflects 
a close acquaintance with the city's bastions of higher learning. 
After graduating from Barnard College, she made costumes for Shakespearean 
plays. Tiring of that, she took a master's degree at Columbia University 
in Renaissance art. Then she went to New York University Law School 
and got serious about corporate law, litigating for Stroock &AMP; 
Stroock &AMP; Lavan and for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison. 
But that bored her, too, and she started a business designing garments 
intricately embroidered in Morocco and Egypt _ where she picked up 
all those chairs, carting them back on planes and boats. The business 
folded, and about that time she started remodeling her apartment and 
wheeling and dealing for the co-op presidency. ``And after all that,'' 
she said, ``I thought, What's left? I guess I'll write a book.'' Now 
she has a title for the sequel: ``The Man in the Cowboy Hat and Other 
Stories.'' CO-OP TIPS A few tips from ``The Co-Op Bible'' on those 
ghastly board interviews: _ ``Until these people are your friends 
(or at least your neighbors), they are your potential enemies. If 
they ask you about your last visit to a lawyer, it's OK to say you 
went to have a will drawn up. Assuming they don't already know from 
their own checking that you're involved in litigation, better play 
it close to the vest or risk being labeled a troublemaker.'' _ Be 
prepared to talk money, the book suggests. The buyer whose finances 
are borderline can use the interview for rehabilitation. If you can, 
make the grand gesture of offering to pay six months' maintenance 
up front. _ Play the role. Like it or not, these interviews are often 
family affairs. So do what's necessary _ ``bribe your youngsters with 
the latest Nintendo game, promise them a pair of Air Jordans, take 
them to Disneyland'' _ to insure their best behavior. _ ``Take care 
not to give responses that are too pat, lest you reveal that you are 
a product of your broker's coaching.'' _ ``Show that you are civic-minded 
but not power-hungry.'' Offer to serve on a committee: ``It's hard 
to argue with someone who's willing to get down and dirty in the garden.'' 
_ Whatever you do, DO NOT say you want to run for the board.
