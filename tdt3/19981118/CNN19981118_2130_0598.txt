Is a marriage the legal union of one man and one woman? Or could it 
be a legal union of two men or two women? The Vermont Supreme Court 
is wrestling with that question. One male and two female couples were 
denied marriage licenses by their town clerks. They lost suits in 
a lower court and appealed. It's the only case of its kind now at 
the state Supreme Court level.
