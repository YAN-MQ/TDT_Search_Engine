U.S. arms inspectors in Iraq have gone back to work following the 
latest showdown with Iraqi authorities that nearly triggered U.S. 
air strikes. But U.S. State Department spokesman, James Rubin, is 
skeptical that Iraq will live up to its promise of cooperation with 
the inspectors. We have serious doubts as to whether Saddam Hussein 
will ever comply with Security Council. \ --including behavior like 
killing your own people with chemical weapons. UN inspectors set out 
from their Baghdad headquarters Wednesday to carry out their duties 
for the first time in more than two weeks. They were expected to check 
long-term monitoring equipment as they began to test Iraq's promise 
of unconditional cooperation. UN officials say the crucial test will 
come when surprise searches for hidden weapons are carried out at 
new sites. I am Dave DeForest, VOA News.
