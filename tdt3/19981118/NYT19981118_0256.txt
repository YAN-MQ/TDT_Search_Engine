LOS ANGELES _ ``Martial Law,'' a cartoonish kung fu series on CBS, 
has been one of the odder and more successful experiments on network 
television this fall, but now it is embarking on yet another experiment 
that speaks volumes about the immense pressures on the networks to 
conjure up hits: the show is undergoing the sort of midseason surgery 
previously reserved for dying shows, by adding the onetime talk show 
host Arsenio Hall as the co-star. It is an attempt to make everything 
about the show large, its humor, its action scenes and, if the television 
gods approve, its ratings. And so Hall, who will play a cop named 
Terrell, made his entry on the set the other day in an appropriate 
fashion _ by lying down on the show's unlikely star, Sammo Hung. Hung 
had been chasing some assassins at a huge outdoor party when Terrell 
leaped to his aid and the two ended up in a heap. Hung wrestled free 
and exclaimed, ``You saved my life!'' ``So you're not the caterer, 
are you?'' Hall asked. Indeed, just who will be on top in the cast 
of this series, one of the bigger surprises of an otherwise dismal 
fall season, and who is really saving whom, is the question as ``Martial 
Law'' takes another leap into the unknown this Saturday, when Hall 
makes his debut. The evolution of ``Martial Law'' is as good an illustration 
as any of just how the process of developing shows has been transformed 
into a much more nervous and hands-on process by the new hardball 
economics of television. ``Martial Law'' was an unlikely bet from 
the start. It was thrown together in a mere seven weeks last spring, 
compared with a year or so for most new shows, in an effort by CBS 
to attract the coveted young male audience with kung fu antics and 
over-the-top humor; indeed, in a recent episode Hung fights off a 
pack of security guards while wearing a huge chicken suit. In addition, 
Hung has been a movie director rather than an actor in recent years, 
speaks only a modest amount of English, and, with his girth, looks 
more like Danny DeVito than Bruce Lee. In most weeks, ``Martial Law'' 
has been the most successful new one-hour series of the season, though 
it is not a breakout hit by any stretch. It ranked 53rd last week, 
with 11.3 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, but 
is winning its Saturday time slot for the most part. Although the 
show is running slightly behind last year's ratings for ``Dr. Quinn, 
Medicine Woman,'' the CBS drama it replaced, it is more than 40 percent 
ahead in terms of its male audience. CBS is delighted with the performance 
of ``Martial Law,'' underscoring an important fact about network television: 
the greatest profits come from luring what is perceived to be the 
biggest-spending, hardest-to-attract slice of the audience, younger 
men. As a result, CBS recently announced that it had ordered 9 more 
episodes, bringing the total to 21. And yet CBS and the producers 
are tinkering with it by adding Hall. (Technically, Hall has been 
signed as a guest star for three episodes, but all concerned hope 
the job will be permanent.) Hall has failed to create a hit in two 
previous shows, but this is a risk everyone seems gung-ho about to 
improve the odds of a long shot, or, as Leslie Moonves, the president 
of CBS Television, put it, ``stacking the deck.'' The producers are 
now frantically revising scripts and struggling to turn a fish-out-of-water 
show into a buddy cop show with a larger component of humor. Series 
surgery brings mixed results. ``Men Behaving Badly,'' for instance, 
underwent major revisions last year, but they could not save a show 
that had been struggling. Some successful shows, however, like ``Homicide'' 
and ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' have had big cast changes over the years and 
still done well afterward. As luck would have it, the producers of 
``Martial Law'' are transforming the show into a close cousin, if 
not a copy, of one of the biggest breakout hit movies of the fall, 
``Rush Hour,'' which happens to have a kung fu star, Jackie Chan, 
and a black comic, Chris Tucker, as loopy cops. The ``Martial Law'' 
producers insist they had the idea of combining an African-American 
detective and a Chinese martial arts expert long before the movie's 
returns stunned Hollywood, but they do concede that, at the least, 
the film legitimized the concept. Stanley Tong, an executive producer 
of the show, said that, in fact, the producers had suggested such 
a pairing initially and that CBS had hesitated for fear the show would 
be ``too ethnic.'' Most important, at a time when the profitability 
of the networks has all but evaporated and the success rate of new 
shows has dwindled, the producers and the network are working in greater 
haste than they once might have to create a major hit. It is analogous 
to the situation in the movie business, where theaters are generally 
reluctant to continue to run films unless they produce a huge first 
weekend. ``It used to be in the old days you had a whole system to 
let a show find itself and work out the bugs,'' said Terry Botwick, 
a CBS senior vice president in charge of dramas. ``The creative process 
works differently now. The spotlight is so big and the competition 
is so intense that you rarely have a show break out right away.'' 
Sandy Grushow, the president of 20th Century Fox Television, the News 
Corp. unit that helps produce ``Martial Law,'' also emphasized that 
if a show is going to survive, it has to be given a big push quickly. 
``We live in a world where, if you're not moving forward, you're moving 
backward,'' Grushow said. ``Instant hits are just about a thing of 
the past.'' He added: ``Normally, when you do a makeover on a show 
you're trying to salvage it. We have an interesting animal on our 
hands here. The show has performed very well. It's on the cusp of 
becoming a real hit, we think. Our feeling was and is that we have 
a real opportunity with Arsenio to take it up to the next level. And 
to do that quickly.'' The idea of introducing Hall came from 20th 
Century Fox Television, which made an unsuccessful pilot for CBS with 
Hall last spring. The show, ``Skip Chasers,'' was a drama about bounty 
hunters. Moonves said that though CBS rejected the pilot, he had been 
convinced Hall was a success waiting to happen. The suggestion to 
pair him with Hung, even if that meant reinventing the story arc, 
was enthusiastically received. ``I just felt Arsenio brings a new 
dimension to this,'' Moonves said. ``Adding to the comedy would certainly 
help our female numbers on a male-oriented show.'' There was, however, 
the delicate subject of how to sell the idea to both Hall and Hung. 
Hall was used to creating and being the sole star of his shows, and 
Hung had built ``Martial Law'' and now faced the prospect of getting 
second billing. No one involved would disclose salaries, but it was 
also clear that Hall would be paid close to twice as much per episode 
as Hung, in the range of $80,000 per episode, according to some industry 
executives. ``They thought I wouldn't do something that I wasn't the 
star of,'' Hall said. ``They kind of floated the idea carefully to 
see what I would do. But I said, `No, it's not like that.' Look, I 
want to act. I love it. I don't want audiences to see me and think, 
`former talk show host.' I want them to see me as an actor.'' At least 
initially, the actors are embracing the changes as a way of lifting 
the show up a notch. ``Sammo's still the star,'' Tong said. ``I don't 
think he would agree to change that. And we don't want to do that. 
Arsenio was very honest about that and fair to Sammo. He was cool 
about it.'' Hall concurred. ``It's Sammo's show,'' he said.
