Coming around to sports time once again and here is Ray Kuzial. Tom 
Glavin of baseball's Atlanta Braves has won the Psi Young Award as 
the best pitcher in the National League for the second time in his 
career. He also earned the honor back in 1991. Glavin edged to San 
Diego reliever, Trevor Hoffman, by 11 points. But Hoffman received 
the most first place votes. This is the first time in Psi Young Award 
history that a pitcher has won without getting the most first place 
votes by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Glavin says 
he was a little surprised to win the award. Quite honestly, I did 
not know how it was going to go. I mean, you know, obviously, that 
was reflected with the closeness of the vote. Trevor had a great year. 
Kevin Brown had a great year and Dennis Molsey and Mattox did as well. 
So, you know, I kind of did not worry about it too much. I just kind 
of let the day come and hope for good news and either way, I would 
have been happy about the year I had. But this is, this obviously, 
you know, makes it a lot happier for me. The 32 year-old Glavin as 
the National League's only 20 game winner this season at 20 and 6. 
The left-hander had a 2.46 earned run average. Hoffman had a major 
league leading 53 saves.
