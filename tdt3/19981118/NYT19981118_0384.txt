A bill to ban smoking in public, outlaw all tobacco advertising and 
regulate nicotine levels in cigarettes is about to become law here. 
The bill, the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act, passed Parliament 
last week, and President Nelson Mandela is expected to sign it. South 
Africans are heavy smokers; between 28 and 34 percent light up. Many 
sports events, from the Dunhill Derby to the Gunston 500 surf contest 
to Camel cross-Africa races, are sponsored by tobacco companies. The 
bill, put forward by Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma, is opposed by 
a coalition of tobacco interests, media and advertising executives 
and free-speech advocates. The African National Congress pushed it 
through, while most opposition parties voted against it _ not because 
they endorse smoking, but because they say it unconstitutionally limits 
free speech, intrudes on privacy, burdens police and grants the health 
minister dangerously large powers. Under the bill, the minister can 
ban all forms of tobacco advertising, sponsorship deals, tie-in products 
and even anything that might be mistaken for a tobacco ad. Smoking 
is banned in workplaces and enclosed public spaces. Restaurants and 
bars must have separate, independently ventilated smoking rooms. Smoking 
illegally can bring a $36 fine; selling to minors a $1,800 one; advertising 
a $36,000 one and possibly jail. The minister can order cigarette 
manufacturers to lower tar and nicotine levels, theoretically down 
to zero. Zuma, a pediatrician, says the law is needed to prevent smoking 
by children and to bring down high lung cancer rates. International 
tobacco companies, frustrated at home, ``are on the offensive in developing 
countries,'' she said at an anti-smoking conference this year. The 
bill is opposed by tobacco companies, one of which, Rembrandt Holdings, 
is one of the country's five biggest conglomerates. The industry says 
that tobacco creates 100,000 jobs and nearly $1 billion in tax revenue. 
Magazines and newspapers say they will lose $50 million in advertising 
revenue. Other opponents say the bill creates absurdities. They say 
smokers who employ maids or babysitters might not be able to smoke 
in their own homes, since they would be workplaces. The police, already 
failing to stem high rates of rape and murder, would chase smokers. 
The popular Camel and Marlboro lines of clothing would be banned. 
``Just saying `Gold' or using the color might be banned because it 
implies Benson &AMP; Hedges,'' said Laura Polecutt, executive director 
of the Freedom of Expression Institute. The institute, a long-established 
defender of free speech, opposes the section of the bill banning advertising, 
arguing that commercial speech is constitutionally protected. The 
Freedom of Commercial Speech Trust, recently created with the backing 
of the tobacco and media industries, plans to take the bill to the 
Constitutional Court. Dr. Ruth Rabinowitz, a member of Parliament 
specializing in health issues for the Inkatha Freedom Party, objected 
to the powers the law gives the minister. Exceptions to the ban ``are 
totally at her whim,'' Dr. Rabinowitz said. ``If she likes the person, 
or if it's someone in the ANC unions with an interest in Camel jackets 
saying jobs will be lost, she can let them go on. If it's some dirty 
buzzard who took her to court, she can shut them down. ``There are 
no checks anywhere along the line. To be truthful, our health-related 
bills should all say: `The minister may do as she likes.'''
