in an effort to further insulate the economy from a possible slide 
this winter, the federal reserve has lowered interest rates again. 
if you can't get waited on this holiday shopping season, blame the 
federal reserve. what it will mean, there'll be a few more people 
in there elbowing you out as you try to get over and look at those 
things for your wife. i think it might spur on some of the christmas 
shopping as well with the lower interest rates. experts say tuesday's 
quarter-point drop in the federal reserve short-term interest rate 
could mean more holiday hiring as employers loosen up a bit. but even 
more holiday shoppers, because their monthly mortgages and the cost 
of borrowing could go down. it actually affects us because we're looking 
at buying a house. lower credit card rates will take a little longer 
as competition among credit card companies heats up, driving rates 
down. you get a little something in the mail which says, "start with 
us. we're only going to charge you 6%, not 12%." is this the last 
cut? probably not. the federal reserve board meets again december 
22nd. there are some indications consumers may wake up on christmas 
morning with another financial gift in their holiday stockings. greg 
lefevre, cnn, san francisco.
