Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on Wednesday ruled out a new Australian 
inquiry into the 1991 killing of pro-independence protesters in East 
Timor, but stopped short of accusing his predecessor Gareth Evans 
of a cover-up. Indonesia has admitted 50 people died when its troops 
opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Santa Cruz cemetery 
in the East Timorese capital of Dili in November 1991. But Mario Carrascalao, 
the Indonesian governor of East Timor at the time, said Wednesday 
about 200 demonstrators died, many of them murdered in follow-up killings 
by Indonesian troops. The claim has prompted new allegations that 
Evans, Australia's foreign minister at the time, was informed of the 
later killings, despite public denials. Carrascalao said a witness 
named Carlos told him at least 100 people were buried in a mass grave 
at a rubbish dump near Dili. He said many others wounded were later 
killed by Indonesian troops. ``On the same day of the killings of 
Santa Cruz, my wife and Bishop Belo went together to Santa Cruz,'' 
he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio Wednesday. ``My wife counted 
18 very heavily wounded and when she visited the hospital ... she 
could not even see one of those.'' Carrascalao said he believed many 
of those wounded had been later killed by Indonesian troops and thrown 
in a river. He said he had not informed the Australian ambassador 
at the time, Philip Flood, of the additional killings. Downer said 
it was likely there were follow-up killings in Dili. ``I think there's 
strong evidence people were killed over and above those who were killed 
at Dili,'' Downer said Wednesday. ``But whether, as you put it rather 
emotively, it was a massacre, as distinct from people being killed 
in a more ad hoc way, I think that's very hard to judge.'' Downer 
made clear he would not be ordering any new investigation into the 
incident. ``This was in 1991. It's not possible for us to do more 
than to once more review the files,'' Downer said. ``I don't think, 
really, in 1998, there's a great deal as the foreign minister I can 
do. I think it's a matter you should raise with Gareth Evans because 
he was the minister at the time.'' Downer said he did not believe 
Evans would have covered up a second massacre. ``I don't think I could 
ever claim that Gareth Evans would have deliberately gone out and 
covered up material,'' Downer said. Evans was in Kuala Lumpur for 
a conference of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and was 
not available to comment on the allegations Wednesday. He was to return 
to Australia Thursday.
