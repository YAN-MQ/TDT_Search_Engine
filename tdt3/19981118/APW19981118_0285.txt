The Turkish ambassador repeated warnings Wednesday that his country 
will take retaliatory measures if Russian anti-aircraft missiles are 
delivered to Cyprus. But he said the measures would not be aimed at 
Russia. Russia is selling S-300 missiles to the Cypriot government 
which controls the ethnic Greek side of the divided island nation. 
Turkey, which supports the ethnic Turkish side of the island, is angered 
by the deal and has threatened to use force to prevent the deployment 
of the weapons. In an interview carried Wednesday by the Interfax 
news agency, Ambassador Nabi Sensoy said any possible retaliation 
would be directed at the missiles. ``If we respond, it will focus 
on the arms in the Greek section. Therefore, Russia and Turkey would 
not clash on this issue,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We will not 
interfere in Russia's matters although the sale of the weapons runs 
counter to our interests and poses a threat,'' he added. But he said 
Turkey could not ignore the fact that ``the systems which could be 
used in an offensive against it will be controlled and inspected by 
Russian experts.'' ``The three parties (Moscow, Nicosia and Athens) 
involved will have to contemplate the consequences of this sale,'' 
he added. Turkey claims the deployment of the missiles is a menace 
both to Turkish Cypriots and to Turkey itself, and has threatened 
pre-emptive strikes against them. The S-300 is similar to the U.S. 
Patriot missile, which was used against Iraqi missiles during the 
Gulf War. Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish communities 
since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded following an abortive coup 
by ethnic Greeks who supported union with Greece.
