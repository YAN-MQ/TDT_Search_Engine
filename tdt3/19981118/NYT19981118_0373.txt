In their debut appearance as heirs to the latest American political 
dynasty, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his younger brother, Gov.-elect 
Jeb Bush of Florida, Wednesday stepped forward as models for what 
they described as a new ``compassionate conservatism.'' As Republicans 
lament and point fingers over their party's discouraging performance 
in the midterm elections, the Bush brothers, sitting side-by-side 
at a joint news conference at the opening of the Republican Governors 
Association's annual convention, were still savoring their electoral 
triumphs. And they were not bashful in proclaiming themselves as exemplars 
for their party. ``The conservative philosophy doesn't have to be 
confined to certain people,'' said the Texas governor, who won impressive 
support from members of minority groups, particularly from Hispanic 
voters. ``A conservative philosophy can extend its message across 
demographic lines. A conservative philosophy is one that can attract 
Hispanics if properly positioned. And the Republican Party needs to 
do just that.'' As his older brother looked on approvingly, Jeb Bush 
said, ``It's the style of governance, George's case and, the style 
of campaigning in my case, that might be a good lesson.'' The sons 
of former President George Bush emerged as such a marquee attraction 
here that they scheduled their own briefing and were mobbed by reporters 
and Republican operatives who seemed to barely notice other party 
luminaries, including Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate Republican 
leader. Much of the frenzy was around the Texas governor who, fresh 
from an overwhelming re-election victory, has emerged as the most-talked 
about prospect for the party's presidential nomination in 2000. There 
was also curiosity about Jeb Bush, who won the governorship after 
a narrow loss four years ago. Texas is the nation's second largest 
state and Florida is the fourth largest, and between the two 35 million 
people will again have a Bush first family. ``He's the tall one and 
I'm the short one,'' Gov. Bush, who is 52, said of the lanky 45-year-old 
politician he described as ``my little brother.'' With a wide smile, 
the Texas governor insisted, ``I haven't made up my mind yet,'' about 
whether to run for president. If he does, he said, ``I'm going to 
have to start sending signals.'' Yet there were signals aplenty Wednesday. 
Bush said he thought the next president should be a governor. And 
he made it clear that one way or another, he and his brother would 
have influential roles in the presidential competition. Not since 
1967 _ when Nelson Rockefeller was governor of New York and his brother, 
Winthrop, was governor of Arkansas _ have two brothers occupied governor's 
mansions. ``Someone to be running for president, it would be wise 
for them to knock on Jeb Bush's door,'' George Bush said. ``Florida's 
an important state.'' After a pause, he added, ``Just like it would 
be wise for someone to knock on the Texas governor's door.'' The Texas 
governor said the point of the event was to introduce his brother 
to the press. ``I can't tell you how proud I was to see him walk in 
the Republican governors' meeting,'' George Bush said, adding, ``This 
guy's a good guy and I love him a lot.'' But George Bush began taking 
questions from reporters before his brother even had a chance to speak. 
In fact, Jeb Bush stayed quiet for much of the nearly half-hour session 
and often looked on with amusement as his brother, teased, hinted 
and parried with his questioners about his aspirations. When the Florida 
governor-elect was called upon to speak, he was often asked about 
the man sitting next to him. And when the session ended, Jeb Bush 
walked out while his brother _ enjoying the limelight _ lingered with 
reporters for another 15 minutes until his aides finally pulled him 
out. Jeb Bush said his brother would be ``an awesome candidate,'' 
should he decide to run. Although he expressed concern about the toll 
a candidacy could take on his brother's family, he said, ``If he announces 
his candidacy, we won't have a family vote. Everybody will be lined 
up to help him.'' The governor-elect said his brother has had such 
success that he ``was the first Texas governor, I think, in a long 
while, that got re-elected.'' His brother, with a smile, corrected 
him, saying he was the ``first ever'' governor of Texas to win two 
consecutive four-year terms. While the brothers _ the two eldest of 
the four Bush sons _ seemed to get on fine, there were signs of the 
old Bush family competitiveness as they ribbed each other. Asked by 
a reporter if George was the savvy brother and Jeb was the smart one, 
George replied, ``I'd describe me as the smart one.'' And as they 
discussed how aggressive Republicans should be in pressing their agenda, 
Jeb turned to his brother, jabbed him on the shoulder, and asked, 
``Can I disagree on a minor point?'' His brother shot back, ``Make 
sure it's a minor point.'' Lest anyone think the event Wednesday marked 
the unveiling of a future Bush-Bush ticket, Jeb Bush nixed the idea 
with a ready one-liner. ``A nepotism rule precludes that from happening,'' 
he said.
