UN arms inspectors in Iraq are out doing their jobs following the 
latest crisis that nearly led to U.S. air strikes. A spokeswoman for 
the UN special commission said that some of the staff are out on inspections 
today, checking on long-term monitoring equipment at various sites. 
They will be testing how well Iraq abides by its promise of unconditional 
cooperation with ONSCOM, also. UN officials said the crucial test 
comes when inspectors attempt to make searches without prior notice 
at new sites.
