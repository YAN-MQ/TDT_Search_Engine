John Schmitt, the Jets' center when they won Super Bowl III in 1969, 
recalled how his former coach and general manager took a chance on 
him when no one else was interested and eventually surprised him with 
a contract bonus. Emerson Boozer, the Super Bowl tailback, laughed 
as he told how that contract generosity was not always what it appeared 
to be. From Texas to Pennsylvania, from Louisiana and Mississippi 
to New Jersey and Long Island, the old-timers had smiles in their 
voices Wednesday. They were saddened that Weeb Ewbank, the pro football 
coach who had touched and often changed their lives, died Tuesday 
at age 91, but in telephone interviews they remembered the fun days 
with Ewbank and the lessons they learned. Joe Namath talked about 
upsetting Ewbank with his rash guarantee that the Jets would beat 
the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Two keys to that victory were 
Matt Snell's running and Dave Herman's blocking, and both players 
told how Ewbank had cut through the mumbo jumbo to devise the winning 
formula. Hank Stram talked about coaching against Ewbank and Walt 
Michaels talked about coaching for him. Here are their stories: JOHN 
SCHMITT, who owns an insurance company in Milford, Conn.: ``I was 
a 297-pound tackle from Hofstra, and nobody in pro football wanted 
me. Weeb signed me as a free agent for $8,500 a year, which was $1,000 
more than my father was making at the time, and made me a center. 
He was like another father to me, but he was tight with money. When 
he was negotiating a contract, he had tears in his eyes if he gave 
you a raise. After the Super Bowl, I wanted $30,000 for the next year. 
He said, `When I had Jim Parker in Baltimore, he was the greatest 
tackle ever, and he made only $27,500.' I said, `Coach, that was many 
years ago.' Weeb finally said, `OK, you've got a deal, $30,000.' I 
said how about a three-year contract with a $3,000 raise each year. 
He said, `That's a $100,000 deal.' `I said, `Yes, Coach, but I think 
I'm worth it.' He agreed and asked me to sign a blank contract and 
he would fill in the numbers. Can you imagine anyone signing a blank 
contract now? But I signed it, and a few days later my copy arrived 
in the mail. He gave me $1,500 more than we had agreed on.'' EMERSON 
BOOZER, who supervises a drug program in the town of Huntington on 
Long Island: ``The man was a great teacher and knew how to put you 
in a relaxed state, but he was tough with money. After the Super Bowl, 
when my contract was up, I met with Sonny Werblin, the team president. 
I was making $20,000 a year. He agreed to raise me to $30,000 the 
next year and $35,000 the year after. He said Weeb would finalize 
it the next day. So I saw Weeb. He closed the door and said: ` Werblin 
said to give you $5,000 more next year. I'm going to give you $10,000 
more.''' JOE NAMATH, a television analyst living in Tequesta, Fla., 
on his Super Bowl guarantee: ``You can't print the things he said. 
Weeb said, `They'll put that on the bulletin board.' I said, `Hey, 
Coach, if they need clippings from that bulletin board, then they're 
in deep trouble.' But I felt bad that I did upset him. We had our 
times when we didn't get along and I grew through that. Coach Bear 
Bryant told me the people you go to are very important when you turn 
pro. I wanted to play for Weeb and what he accomplished with Johnny 
Unitas.'' MATT SNELL, who owns a construction company in Jersey City, 
N.J.: ``Weeb was smart. Before the Super Bowl, he told us we've just 
got to run the ball and we'll win the game. We didn't have any idea 
which plays would work, but we finally found one play: 19 Straight. 
We would run behind Winston Hill at offensive tackle and cut inside 
or outside. Of my 28 carries, I must have run that play 12 or 15 times. 
Weeb told Joe Namath, `Let's keep running it until they stop it.' 
They never stopped it.'' DAVE HERMAN, a financial planner in New York: 
``For the Super Bowl, Weeb moved me from guard to tackle. I weighed 
255 and I had to block Bubba Smith, who must have weighed 320. After 
the game, Weeb said to me, `How many guys could I ask to do that?' 
I was proud of that. I loved him. My daughter was born with cerebral 
palsy, and he made me bring her to Saturday workouts so he could talk 
to her. In recent years, I talked to him every two weeks. The last 
time was a week ago, and the first thing he said was, `How are the 
kids?''' HANK STRAM of Covington, La., a pro football analyst: ``A 
coach has to accumulate talent, assess it and make it play like it's 
supposed to and win. He did all of that extremely well, and I never 
thought he got the credit he deserved. One time when we played at 
Kansas City, both benches were on the same side of the field. We had 
30 yards of space and they had 30. But on the opening kickoff, the 
ball is still in the air and he's running toward it and there he is, 
next to me, swinging his arms back and forth across his chest. From 
then on, I called him the Penguin.'' WALT MICHAELS, semiretired, Pennsylvania: 
``He always said don't try to win too many games until you have enough 
people to win the whole thing. In our first year with the Jets, he 
said, `We don't have a lot of players, so let's take the heat and 
build this thing.' We did. He used to say: `Coaching is like riding 
a motorcycle. Stay in it long enough and you'll get killed.' At least 
he survived it.'' JOHNNY SAMPLE, a Super Bowl defensive back and now 
a talk-show host in Philadelphia: ``He coached Otto Graham, Johnny 
Unitas and Joe Namath, three of the greatest quarterbacks who ever 
played. His knowledge of offense was great. He didn't work much with 
defensive players, but he used to come into our meetings with little 
hints. Once, he told me to get up on a receiver and jam him. That 
was in 1958, and no one had ever thought of that before.'' DON MAYNARD, 
a Hall of Fame wide receiver and now a financial planner in El Paso, 
Texas: ``I've played under nine head coaches and 42 assistant coaches, 
and I've learned how not to coach. He knew how to do it. He was always 
open to suggestions. I wanted to round out certain pass patterns and 
he didn't like the idea, but I showed him and he agreed. As a result, 
when I ran a 10-yard out, I turned my head and Joe Namath would have 
the ball in my hands.'' LARRY GRANTHAM, a linebacker on the Super 
Bowl Jets and now a manufacturer's representative in Olive Branch, 
Miss.: ``We had a lot of fun with him. He was a master of double talk. 
He would stand in front of a crowd and talk longer and say less than 
anyone. He would call a players' meeting before a trip and say: `How 
many of you want your pre-game steak rare? How many medium? How many 
well done?' If the numbers didn't add up or if someone didn't vote, 
we had to do it again. We kept it going pretty good.'' ARTIE DONOVAN, 
defensive tackle for Ewbank's champion Colts in 1958 and 1959 and 
the owner of the Valley Country Club in Towson, Md.: ``He kept me 
in the league eight more years so I didn't have to go back to New 
York and become a cop. I think he was as good a coach as there's ever 
been. He took the Colts and the Jets, two of the worst teams ever 
to play football, and made them champions. During World War II, if 
the Navy had made him and Paul Brown spies instead of football coaches, 
we'd own Russia now.''
