Researchers report student aid grants are not keeping pace with the 
soaring cost of a college education. Pell grants, the major federal 
assistance for low-income students, go about half as far as they did 
20 years ago. In 1976 and '77, the grants covered 19% of the costs 
at a private school, 39% at a public school. In 1996 and '97, the 
grants paid just 9% of the costs at a private school, 22% at a public 
school.
