U.S. arms inspectors in Iraq have gone back to work following the 
latest showdown with Iraqi authorities that nearly triggered U.S. 
air strikes. Inspectors set out from their Baghdad headquarters to 
carry out the duties for their first time in more than two weeks. 
They were expected to check long-term monitoring equipment, as they 
begin to test Iraq's promise of unconditional cooperation. UN officials 
say the crucial test will come when surprise searches for hidden weapons 
are carried out at these new sites.
