On the eve of the official opening of the second set of impeachment 
hearings in just a quarter century in this country, what will happen 
in the morning? What's going on behind the scenes in Washington tonight? 
What is Ken Starr likely to say when he is sworn in? Also tonight, 
a look at the last time this happened, a look at what has changed 
since 1974. Here on Capitol Hill tonight, the republican party is 
literally under new management. The vote was today. Tonight there 
are new players at the top of the party and most of the jobs. We'll 
talk live to new of the nation's G.O.P. glove nors. And the crisis 
has not entirely passed afterall. In fact, there are indications the 
situation in Iraq could be close to heating up once again.
