In Malaysia, the apec summit is ending. One of the high points was 
a speech by Al Gore, who offered sympathy for the reform movement 
there. That earned Gore disapproval from other apec members. As for 
the summit itself, leaders are approving a modest set of proposals 
aimed at helping pacific Rim nations recover from the economic process.
