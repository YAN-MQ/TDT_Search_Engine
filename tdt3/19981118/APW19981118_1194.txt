Hungary scored two goals in the first seven minutes to beat Switzerland 
2-0 in an exhibition match Wednesday before 4,000 fans braving near-freezing 
weather at Ferencvaros stadium. In the very first minute, Janos Hrutka 
headed Istvan Pisont's long shot to Gyoergy Korsos, who fired the 
ball into the net from three meters (yards). Six minutes later, left 
winger Gabor Egressy passed to the right, where Jozsef Seboek headed 
it in from five meters (yards) for 2-0. The Swiss regrouped and concentrated 
more, bent on at least stopping the host team, but were not able to 
score themselves. The Hungarian defense stoold their ground on home 
turf, stopping all Swiss offensives, although in the 34th minute the 
visitors nearly scored when Raphael Wicky fired from 14 meters, but 
the ball went just wide of the right goal post. ``The Swiss played 
arrogantly,'' was how Gyoergy Mezei, a former all-stars player, saw 
it on state TV, commenting on the first half. The Hungarians were 
more cautious - and slower - in the second half, while the Swiss were 
more aggressive but failed failed to score. In the 72nd minute, Sebastien 
Jeanneret headed the ball just over the net from two meters (yards).
