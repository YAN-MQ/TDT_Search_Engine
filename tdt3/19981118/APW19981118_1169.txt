RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Members of an agrarian reform movement 
have stormed the doors of bank agencies in two northern cities to 
pressure authorities to release already approved credits for reform. 
``There is so much red tape that even when the money is released there 
is more red tape,'' Landless Rural Workers Movement spokesman Nilton 
Vianna told the Associated Press Wednesday. The invasions occurred 
at branch offices of the state-run Banco do Nordeste in the cities 
of Vitoria da Conquista and Itabuna in the northern state of Bahia, 
said Vianna. The movement often sends its members to invade large 
fallow holdings owned by wealthy ranchers. The say such invasions 
are necessary in a nation where some 90 percent of Brazil's arable 
land is owned by 20 percent of the population while the poorest 40 
percent owns just 1 percent. Movement leaders say they will authorize 
more bank sit-ins if the federal government fails to release monies 
to buy seeds for the next planting season. ``We hope that after these 
bank sit-ins, the money will come in 15 days,'' said Admar Bogo, a 
Bahia organizer.
