Pacific Rim leaders have wrapped up this year's economic summit in 
Koala Lumpur, after approving a marched set of proposals to battle 
the area's worse financial crisis in decades In a joint declaration, 
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Group pledged to work together 
to support battered economies in the region. It also said those countries 
hardest hit by the crisis must continue adopting painful economic 
reforms. The declaration said APEC leaders are committed to working 
together for an early and sustained recovery in the region. Participants 
called for a close monitoring of capital flows to contain currency 
speculators. VOA's Amy Vickers, says the U.S. has been among those 
concerned about protecting capital flows from regulation. They want 
to deregulate further they don't want further regulation as Prime 
Minister, Mahatier wants. That said, Vice President Gore and others 
have all said that they view the hot money that rushes in and out 
of countries at a moment's notice as a problem. The summit heard a 
sobering assessment of the region's recovery prospects from the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation. It forecasts continued recession until late 
1999.
