In music news, a new album on the market called Wide Prairie is the 
late Linda McCartney. She died of breast cancer last Spring. But she 
never really wanted to be a rock star. She only stepped on stage at 
the urging of her husband, ex-Beatle, Paul McCartney. And as VOA'S 
Katherine Cole reports, Paul's effort to produce and release Wide 
Prairie is a labor of love. Linda McCartney was rightly admired for 
many reasons. Her work as a photographer, her unwavering devotion 
to her family and to various causes. Music was not a major talent 
for her. The 16 tunes on Wide Prairie range from strange to weird 
to wistful. Most were written or co-written by Linda and all produced 
by Paul. Who also acts as a backup singer and instrumentalist. The 
first song that Linda McCartney wrote, Seaside Woman was recorded 
with the band Wings and is also one of the album's best. That is Seaside 
Woman from Wide Prairie, a collection by Linda McCartney. Another 
familiar song is Cook of the House, which was included on the 1976 
album, Wings at the Speed of Sound. It captures the playfulness that 
was evident in much of the McCartneys' work together. The Light Comes 
from Within is one of the new songs. Paul describes it as Linda's 
answer to all those people who had ever put her down. The Light Comes 
From Within. That is off the Linda McCartney CD, Wide Prairie and 
features a fierce guitar solo by son, James. The album's last song 
is about Linda McCartney's beloved Appaloosa horses. It was recorded 
just a month before she died and featured some fine guitar work from 
Paul. Wide Prairie documents a life full of love and courage. No song 
on the record is more moving than Paul McCartney's liner notes, which 
suggest how this album should be seen. As a tribute to a life that 
ended too soon. I am Katherine Cole.
