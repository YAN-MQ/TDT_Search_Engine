In the streets and in Parliament, Turks rallied behind their leaders 
Wednesday in their tough stand on a Kurdish rebel chief detained in 
Italy: No relenting in their demand for his extradition. No negotiating 
with the rebels. Abdullah Ocalan's supporters in Europe showed equal 
fervor. One of about 500 Kurds camped outside the military hospital 
in Rome where Ocalan is believed to be held set himself on fire with 
gasoline Wednesday, crying out Ocalan's name. Ocalan ordered his followers 
to stop such fiery protests, which have left several Kurd inmates 
in Turkish prisons hospitalized with burns and killed one protester 
in Moscow. ``If you want to prove your loyalty, you must quit such 
actions immediately,'' he said in a statement read to followers. Ocalan 
leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a bloody, 
14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's southeast. He was 
arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport as soon as he stepped off a flight 
from Russia, which denied him asylum. Italy is weighing his asylum 
request and expected to reject Turkey's request for his extradition. 
Turkey's government offered its people free use of fax machines Wednesday 
to send protests to the Italian government to press for his return. 
Thousands of Turks gathered outside the Italian Embassy in Ankara 
for a second day, burning Italian flags and demanding extradition. 
Although Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government is on the 
brink of collapse over mafia scandals, it was clear Wednesday that 
support for the tough line on Ocalan crossed all political lines. 
``No government of the Turkish republic will ever .. sit at the table 
with the monster that has blood on his hands,'' Yilmaz declared in 
Parliament, drawing overwhelming applause from allies and opponents 
alike. The conflict between Turkey and Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers 
Party has killed 37,000. The military has always drawn strong public 
support in the war against the rebels despite thousands of losses. 
Turkey has never responded to Ocalan's calls for cease-fires. In Italy, 
he insists that he has now renounced violence. ``We have abandoned 
terrorism and are ready for a peace accord,'' Ocalan told the daily 
newspaper La Repubblica. ``My presence here testifies to a change 
in the strategy of the Kurdish national movement.'' Yilmaz said Italy's 
response to the extradition request would be a test of its commitment 
to combat terrorism. ``If it does not pass this test successfully, 
it will become an accomplice to all the murders the (rebels) have 
committed until now,'' he told Parliament. Italian Premier Massimo 
D'Alema rejected the accusation, telling a news conference in Rome: 
``Italy doesn't justify terrorism and doesn't want to be an accomplice.'' 
``The Italian government will respect the laws of our country and 
isn't disposed to submit to intimidation,'' D'Alema said. In Washington, 
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Ocalan had renounced 
terrorism repeatedly in the past, only to later renege. He called 
Turkey the logical place to send Ocalan because it was the only country 
to pursue extradition. ``The vast majority of the terrorist acts committed 
by this man was against Turkish citizens on Turkish soil,'' he added. 
There are 20 to 25 million Kurds spread out in Turkey, Syria, Iran 
and Iraq and hundreds of thousands more in Europe. Turkey does not 
recognize its 12 to 15 million Kurds as an official minority, which 
would give them the right to teach and broadcast in their own language.
