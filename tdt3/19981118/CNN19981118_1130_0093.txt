President Clinton says Japan must take decisive steps to repair its 
battered economy. He made the comment before leaving on a trip to 
Japan, south Korea and guam. He says Japan is Asia's engine of growth, 
and needs to get things restarted before growth can be restored in 
Asia. President Clinton said it's easy for Asia's money troubles to 
become U.S. money troubles. If people overseas lose their jobs, therefore 
they can't afford American products and our farmers and workers pay 
the price. We see that in the slight decline so far in our exports 
this year due to the global financial crisis in general and the problems 
in Asia in particular. Clearly in order to sustain progress at home, 
therefore we have to exercise leadership abroad.
