After six editions in Europe and one in Asia, the World Athletics 
Championships appear headed to North America for the first time in 
2001. But will they go to the United States or Canada? Stanford, the 
prestigious university in Palo Alto, Calif., and Edmonton, capital 
of the Canadian province of Alberta, are the favorites in the race 
for track and field's showcase event. Paris and New Delhi, India, 
are also in the running for what is considered the third biggest international 
sports event behind the Olympics and the World Cup. The International 
Amateur Athletic Federation will select the winner Thursday in Monte 
Carlo, Monaco. New Delhi has little chance of winning in the secret 
vote by 27 members of the IAAF Council. But Paris can't be counted 
out, especially if Stanford and Edmonton cancel each other out. Logic 
says it's time for the championships to go to North America after 
Helsinki (1993), Rome (1997), Tokyo (1991), Stuttgart (1993), Goteborg 
(1995), Athens (1997) and Seville (1999). ``I think it's going to 
go to North America,'' Nick Petredis, chairman of the 2001 Partnership 
that is trying to secure the bid for Stanford, said Wednesday. ``I 
just can't make a call which way.'' This is Stanford's third bid after 
previous attempts for the 1997 and 1999 championships. The IAAF's 
powerful Italian president, Primo Nebiolo, has repeatedly stressed 
his desire to hold the championships in the United States. While America 
produces some of the world's greatest track and field stars, the sport 
_ apart from during the Olympics _ continues to founder in the United 
States from lack of public interest, sponsors, funds and television 
coverage. ``It is a very important event we need as a rallying point 
for youth to showcase the sport, like the (1994) World Cup did for 
soccer,'' Petredis said. ``We need to bring up the profile of the 
sport in the U.S.'' Other strong selling points for Stanford are its 
location _ in the popular San Francisco Bay Area _ and the prospect 
of a lucrative American television deal. The championships would be 
held in 86,000-seat Stanford Stadium, with an adjacent nine-lane warmup 
track. The athletes' village would be located 800 yards away from 
the warmup track, while hotels in nearby San Jose would accommodate 
officials and visitors. Petredis, a San Jose attorney, said the bid 
was backed by a ``significant amount'' of public money. He described 
the bid as financially ``bulletproof,'' even though there are no government 
guarantees. ``Our position is that is not a proper use of money in 
the U.S.,'' he said. ``We present a financially very sound bid that 
will feature a unique insurance cover that guarantees our revenue. 
We feel like we have done better than a government guarantee.'' In 
the past, the IAAF awarded a dlrs 7 million grant to cities organizing 
the championships. But that stopped after Goteborg in 1995, leaving 
organizers to finance the event entirely on their own. Financial issues 
could be crucial in Thursday's decision. ``You don't like to find 
problems when you arrive a year or a few months from the championships,'' 
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said. ``It's important to be sure you 
choose a city with financial capacity and organization.'' The Edmonton 
bid has broader and more high-profile support than Stanford. The Canadians 
sent a 27-member delegation to Monaco, headed by Alberta Premier Ralph 
Klein. Stanford sent five people. The province has promised financial 
backing for the championships, which would be held at Commonwealth 
Stadium, home of the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos. Even though Edmonton 
is a relatively small, out-of-the-way place, the city believes it 
has the edge based on experience. Edmonton staged the 1978 Commonwealth 
Games, 1983 University Games and 1996 world figure skating championships. 
Another Alberta city, Calgary, held the 1984 Winter Olympics. In the 
end, it could all come down to politics in the highly political world 
of the IAAF. ``It's no different than the Olympics,'' said Dale Schulha, 
a member of the Edmonton bid committee. ``When you look at major games 
like this that have world impact, there are a lot of factors.'' The 
IAAF will also select the site of the less prestigious world indoor 
championships of 2001. The candidates are Budapest, Hungary; Lisbon, 
Portugal, and Borlange, Sweden.
