If you have a question, we've found the web site that will probably 
have the answer. Here's what's "on-line." Are you someone who likes 
the inside scoop? Then the web site "how stuff works" is just for 
you. The site, at the address below, is a collection of articles written 
by a Man aptly named Marshall brain. Topics vary from computers to 
food to basic technologies. With plain language and smart graphics, 
the site teaches how car engines work, what makes things tick and 
talk, as in cell phones. You can even see how to build your own web 
page. Or learn about man's best friend, the remote control. But please 
don't use yours just yet. Go below the surface and discover how you 
tan or see there's more than meets the eye to tractor pulls. Along 
with its bells and whistles, the site also explains the origin of 
jingle bells and mistletoe in an area called "how Christmas works." 
And if you're willing to tackle the big one, find out how the world, 
yes, the world, works. For links to this and other sites go to -- 
CNN.com and that's what's "On-line."
