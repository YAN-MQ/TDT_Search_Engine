In south Africa tonight, there is a Russian sailor with a remarkable 
tale of survival to tell. He had set out from Charleston, South Carolina, 
two months ago to race single handed around the world. His first port 
of call was Capetown. But in the south atlantic, he was in desperate 
trouble. ABC's Bill Redeker has the rest of the story. He was all 
alone at sea, 400 miles from land, and Viktor yazykov was in trouble. 
It was very bad, very bad situation. Yazykov had badly injured his 
right elbow. It was a life-threatening infection. He needed a doctor. 
But where and how? Using a solar powered computer, he sent an E-mail 
message to the official doctor for the race. 7,000 miles away in Boston, 
Dr. Daniel Carlin typed back -- I prescribed surgery. The tricky part 
was I had to make the surgical procedure very simple. So he E-mailed 
yazykov step by step instructions how to cut and drain the infection. 
But after performing surgery on himself and applying a tourniquet, 
yazykov couldn't get the bleeding to stop. The strong smell of blood 
was so horrible. So he sent a more urgent E-mail -- "have been sitting 
on the bloody cabin floor watching my life drop by drop leaving me. 
My first instruction to him, once this became clear, was immediately 
cut the tourniquet. And he wrote, "apply direct pressure to the wound." 
Finally, the bleeding stopped. It was lifesaving for Viktor. He did 
just perfect job. The next day after sending this E-mail note of thanks, 
yazykov discovered he had also sailed 239 miles, the best "one day 
run" of the race so far. Bill Redeker, ABC News, New York.
