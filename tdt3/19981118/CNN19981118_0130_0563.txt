a new report shows women who eat well-done beef and bacon are more 
likely to develop breast cancer. researchers compared women with a 
diet of well-done beef and bacon to women who eat rare and medium-cooked 
meats. the increased risk may be linked to certain compounds, which 
form when meats are cooked at higher temperatures. critics say the 
study doesn't show a strong enough connection between cancer and cooking, 
and they caution women that undercooked meat can be dangerous too.
