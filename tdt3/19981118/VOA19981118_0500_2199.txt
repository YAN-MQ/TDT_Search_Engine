The showdown over Iraqi weapons inspections forced President Clinton 
to cancel his planned trip to Kuala Lumpur for the APEC meeting. But 
he does take off today for an abbreviated Asian trip that plans to 
visit Japan and Korea. His first stop is Tokyo, where he will discuss 
Japan's efforts to revive its economy. President Clinton will be meeting 
with Japanese Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi, who on Monday, unveiled 
a huge stimulus plan to combat Japan's worst post-war recession. In 
Korea, they will be talking with South Korean leader, Kim Dae-Jung, 
focusing on the latest developments in North Korea.
