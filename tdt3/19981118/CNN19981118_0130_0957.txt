at the annual computer convention known as comdex, much of the hoopla 
this year centers around the latest gadgets. bruce francis reports 
from las vegas. these dogs are mutts -- part camera, part microphone, 
part touch sensor, part pc technology. sony will probably introduce 
them next year for $2,000 to $3,000. more practical -- the memory 
stick. it can store pictures, sound, data, just about everything using 
pc-style memory. these are pretty much indestructible. they're lightweight. 
they have very ruggedized connectors to prevent any kind of problem 
with connectors on it. so it's designed to be consumer-friendly. sony 
plans to put it everywhere, including this slide-show picture frame. 
close to everywhere, it seems, the palm pilot -- with 2 million users 
now, features like beaming a business card from one unit to another 
are increasingly common. and like so many devices at the show this 
year, the palm is getting connected to the internet. this device from 
jp systems lets your hand-held computer access e-mail. the message 
from consumers to makers of high-tech gadgets get connected or get 
lost in the crowd. the value of the device is its ability to connect. 
and that's why the devices may come and go, interconnectivity of devices 
is what's important. chipmaker cyrix is also taking that advice. the 
web pad accesses the internet through a wireless connection to a base 
station, like a cordless phone. cyrix won't make it, but is talking 
to manufactures who will, and inexpensively. but the greatest change 
in the industry may not be technology at all. pc itself, as we know 
it, kind of is a -- it sits at the center of all this and that, over 
time, it begins moving itself to eventually, possibly even being free. 
apple computer's imac may not be free, but the company may be planning 
to get into the low end of the market. oracle corporation chairman 
and ceo larry ellison, who also sits on the apple board, tells "cnn 
financial news" that the company plans to introduce a $500 version 
of the imac next year. bruce francis, "cnn financial news," las vegas.
