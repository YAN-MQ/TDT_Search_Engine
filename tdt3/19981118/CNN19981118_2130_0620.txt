For years scientists have been looking for evidence of what caused 
the extinction of the dinosaurs. A new discovery might help provide 
the answer. Rick Lockridge reports in this edition of "tech trends." 
It was earth's worst day in the last billion years, according to a 
scientist who claims to have found a tiny rock, that had a huge impact. 
I've found a piece of this object that impacted the earth 65 million 
years ago, and it's a piece big enough to analyze, to study and discuss. 
If Frank kyte is right, you're looking at a piece of a Ten-kilometer-wide 
asteroid that struck Mexico's yucutan peninsula, altering the earth's 
climate and wiping out most of the animal species on the planet. Kyle 
says the tiny iridium-and-iron chip could only have come from an asteroid, 
not a Comet. And he says that should end an ongoing debate over which 
of those two objects killed off T-Rex and all of his friends. Comets 
are very icy objects, that's why they emit vapors when they get close 
to the sun, and asteroids are rocky. The data support the probability 
that it is from an asteroid instead of from a Comet. The impact of 
the giant rock gave the earth shakes and a fever. Earthquakes, volcanoes 
and skies full of dust. A hothouse effect kicked in. The dinosaurs 
couldn't take the heat. Kyle found his piece of the rock under the 
seabed thousands of miles from the point of impact. Embedded in a 
layer of fine dust, he says it was easy to spot. It's a thousand times 
bigger than the typical grains of sediment it was deposited in. If 
other scientists can support kyte's contention that this was the rock 
that changed the world, it'll be a defeat for the many scientists 
who still hold to other theories, and a final postscript for the dinosaurs 
-- They were big, but the asteroid was bigger. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
