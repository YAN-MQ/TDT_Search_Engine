The national consumers league says mixing some everyday foods and 
medicine can be dangerous. The league, with help from the food and 
drug administration, has published a brochure warning people what 
combinations they should avoid. Among them -- mixing grapefruit juice 
with antihistamines, like claratin or benadryl, certain heart drugs, 
like procardia or cyclosporin. Doctors say the combination can sometimes 
be deadly. Officials also warn against mixing caffeine with certain 
antibiotics, like cipro, ulcer drugs, like tagamet, Zantac and pepcid, 
or with theophylline, a bronchodilator. They say mixing them can cause 
the jitters and stomach irritation. For more information you can contact
