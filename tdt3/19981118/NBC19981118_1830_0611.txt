One of the most important tactics the U.N. teams in Iraq use is the 
surprise inspection. Scott Ritter is a former member of the U.N. inspection 
force, now a Consultant to NBC news. He told us how the process of 
looking for Saddam's most dangerous weapons works, "in his own words." 
When we take an inspection team into Iraq to carry out a mission of 
discovery, to look for Iraq's hidden capabilities, it's a very confrontational 
process. It's one that's fraught with potential danger, one in which 
the team will be consistently exposed to intimidation on the part 
of the Iraqis. And when we show up to a site that Iraq wants to deny 
us access to, oftentimes the guns come out. The Iraqis will load these 
guns. Sometimes they'll point the guns at the inspectors. Sometimes 
they'll threaten the inspectors with their lives. It is cat-and-mouse. 
It is hide-and-seek. They can lie. They can deny access. They can 
lock doors. They can hide documents. They're in control. We know that 
they've lied about their biological weapons program, we know they 
have lied about their ballistic missile program. We know that they've 
lied about their nuclear program. We know that they've concealed all 
of this from the special commission in a Systematic way. On the few 
occasions where we've had dramatic successes, the elation is indescribable. 
You've spent months, years trying to achieve a certain goal, that 
for a Change I can go back and report, "we did it. We won!" Every 
inspector who goes to Iraq understands that he or she, in on the front 
line of carrying out important disarmament tasks in Iraq, that he 
is doing a precedent-setting work. Nobody's beating the Drums of war, 
nobody wants war. If we avoid decisively confronting Saddam Hussein 
over the issue of weapons inspections today, five years down the road 
there will be a war and it will be significant. Former member of the 
U.N. weapons inspection team, Scott Ritter tonight, "In his own words."
