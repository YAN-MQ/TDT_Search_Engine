Ten hours, 15 universal time. In U.S. News, the White House has accepted 
a congressional invitation to question independent counsel, Kenneth 
Starr, when he testifies at presidential impeachment hearings on Capital 
Hill Thursday. However, lawyers for President Clinton asked Tuesday 
for more than the allotted 30 minutes to question the prosecutor. 
Committee chairman, Henry Hyde, rejected any time extension late in 
the day. Mr. Starr's testimony will mark the first time he has appeared 
in public to discuss his investigation of President Clinton.
