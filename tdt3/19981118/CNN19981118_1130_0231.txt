A United Nations monitors are back in the field in Iraq looking for 
suspected weapons sites. They'll be testing Iraq's pledge of full 
cooperation. Jane arraf reports from Baghdad. U.N. weapons inspectors 
are doing something they haven't done in more than two weeks -- monitoring 
potential Iraqi arms sites. Iraq suspended cooperation with the U.N. 
special commission, UNSCOM, late last month -- leading to threats 
of U.S.-led air strikes. Those strikes were called off after Baghdad 
agreed to let weapons inspections resume. But the U.N. special envoy 
here says the real test of the agreement will come when UNSCOM teams 
carry out more sensitive surprise inspections. We will have to wait 
and see how it actually happens once inspections are resumed and the 
authorities of UNSCOM and iaea go about their task. It is at that 
time that it would have to be determined whether Iraq has extended 
the full cooperation that they have promised. Iraq has been telling 
its people that resuming cooperation will put it on the road to having 
sanctions lifted. But even with the continued threat of U.S. air strikes, 
Iraq says it won't wait much longer. We will do our best to cooperate, 
we will be patient and we will even try to contain provocations,if 
there are any. But naturally there are limits. Iraq says it's expecting 
UNSCOM to stick to its previous agreement to respect its sovereignty, 
security and dignity. Iraq says it's committed to fully cooperating 
with UNSCOM, but it's making clear there are some things that are 
still off limits. That means full cooperation may have to be left 
to interpretation by the security council. Jane arraf, CNN, Baghdad.
