The settlement with big tobacco is sending billions of dollars to 
state treasuries. But that money won't necessarily go for the medical 
treatment of smokers. Deborah feyerick reports on how New York might 
spend its share. New York's expected $25 billion windfall has generated 
lots of ideas among lawmakers and anti-smoking groups on just how 
that money should be spent. The debate was broken down between those 
who think the money should go to reimburse smoking-related health 
care costs and others, who want the money used for projects, they 
believe, have gotten the short end of the stick. I think it's important 
to take care of things that the ordinary budget would not necessarily 
take care of. Sheldon silver, speaker of the New York assembly, wants 
to use the money to rebuild schools and cover people without health 
insurance. Others have suggested improving roads and lowering property 
taxes. But anti-smoking groups say the money should go towards health 
care and aggressive anti-smoking campaigns. It should be education 
for youth, it should be youth cessation, it should be youth accessibility, 
it should be raising the price on tobacco. Silver and others say smoking-related 
health care costs have forced taxpayers to cough up money that would 
have been used for other projects. What we have to be doing is spending 
this money on some of the things that we weren't able to do as a result 
of having to spend this money on medicaid. The city of Buffalo is 
expected to use their share to lower property taxes in the hopes of 
creating jobs. But New York City's mayor Rudy Giuliani says he's not 
making any decisions until he has his expected $6 billion share in 
hand. Do we spend it all in health care or do we spend it in education 
as well? Is it appropriate to use it for some other purposes or not? 
I don't know the answers to all that. It is almost impossible to put 
an exact price tag on just how much the state has spent over the years 
to treat smoking-related illnesses. And while politicians say the 
settlement is a good one, they also say it's only a partial reimbursement. 
Regardless of how New York spends the expected settlement, lawmakers 
say the $25 billion will not cover dollar for dollar what they have 
already spent on smoking-related illnesses. Deborah feyerick, for 
CNN, New York.
