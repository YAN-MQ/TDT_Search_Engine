Israeli warplanes raided suspected bases of Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday 
following a guerrilla ambush near an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, 
security officials said. Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles 
on the deserted village of Aqmata, some 12 kilometers (seven miles) 
north of this southern market town. The targeted area in Iqlim al-Tuffah 
is a stronghold of Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas and is frequently 
used to launch attacks against Israeli troops occupying a border enclave 
in southern Lebanon. The afternoon raid came a few hours after Hezbollah 
detonated a roadside bomb as an Israeli infantry unit was traveling 
near the Blatt outpost, about three kilometers (two miles) north of 
the Israeli border. Hezbollah, in a statement, said the bombing caused 
casualties among the Israeli troops. But security officials, speaking 
on customary condition of anonymity, said there was still no word 
of causalities from the noontime attack. The Israeli air attack comes 
at a time of heightened tension in the volatile region following a 
Hezbollah roadside bombing near the Israeli border Monday which killed 
three Israeli soldiers and wounded four others, two of them seriously. 
The casualties marked the highest Israeli losses in more than a year. 
On Tuesday night, an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile at 
guerrillas who had attacked a military post in the occupied zone. 
There were no casualties. Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust 
Israeli troops and their Lebanese militia allies from the enclave 
Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern territory from cross-border 
attacks.
