More than 20,000 schoolchildren missed their classes Wednesday because 
of a teachers' strike over unpaid salaries in four regions of Ukraine, 
officials said. Strikes involving 1,806 teachers were reported at 
a total of 59 schools in the Crimea, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kirovohrad and 
Ternopil regions, the Education Ministry said. Teachers in other regions 
of the country were prepared to join the strike, it added. Earlier 
this fall, about 12,000 schoolchildren in Ukraine missed several weeks 
of school because of a strike by teachers demanding back wages. Wage 
debts have only mounted since the start of the school year on Sept. 
1, the ministry said, according to the Interfax news agency. Ukrainian 
teachers are owed 428 million hryvna (dlrs 125 million at the current 
exchange rate) in back wages. In the Kirovohrad and Ternopil regions, 
their salaries have not been paid for six to seven months. The former 
Soviet republic's economic troubles are affecting many of the country's 
500,000 teachers at Ukraine's 21,260 schools. Education officials 
say wages are being paid more or less regularly only around Kiev, 
the capital, and two other regions.
