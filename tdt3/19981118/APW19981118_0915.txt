Germany on Wednesday agreed to forgive a 50-million- mark (dlrs 30 
million) debt owed by Jordan as a goodwill gesture toward the Arab 
kingdom. A German Embassy statement said the debt relief agreement 
covered the last trunch of 169.5 million marks (dlrs 102 million) 
in debts owed to Germany accumulated by Jordan in the 1980s. The statement 
did not disclose details of the agreement, saying only that Jordan 
must spend at least half of the amount forgiven on environmental protection 
and projects designed to alleviate poverty. Germany is one of Jordan's 
main European donors, contributing more than dlrs 500 million to various 
water and education projects since 1990. Wednesday's debt-relief agreement 
was reached by visiting German President Roman Herzog, who arrived 
in Jordan on Tuesday on the third leg of a Middle East tour that has 
taken him to Israel and Palestinian territories. Accompanied by his 
wife Christine and a business delegation, Herzog held talks with Crown 
Prince Hassan, who is acting as regent while King Hussein, the Jordanian 
monarch, is away in the United States for medical treatment. Herzog 
also toured several German-financed projects and was scheduled to 
visit historical and biblical sites before he flies on Thursday.
