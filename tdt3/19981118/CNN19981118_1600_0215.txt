Researchers say they may have developed a way to fight disease by 
implanting cells from cows into humans. But that's also raising a 
lot of questions. Susan Candiotti reports. Charlie is a clone. Researchers 
are now looking into whether egg cells from cloned cows like charlie 
could be combined with human cells. Researchers at Massachusetts-based 
advanced cell technology claim they've devised a way to take an egg 
from a cloned cow and replace its nucleus with human genetic material. 
From the egg, researchers say they can grow human stem cells, blank 
cells that can develop into any cell in the human body. Researchers 
hope stem cells can then be removed and customized to repair virtually 
any damaged human tissue. The goal is not to clone a human being but 
to make these embryonic stem cells that are identical to the patient, 
so they will not be rejected by the patient as foreign cells. The 
specter of creating a stem cell that's part cow, part human prompted 
President Clinton to fire off a letter to the national Bioethics advisory 
commission. He said he was "deeply troubled" by experiments mingling 
human and nonhuman species. The issue was hurriedly added to a previously 
scheduled Bioethics meeting in Miami. The commission, created by the 
president, is now launching a study into the legal and ethical questions 
posed by the potential of stem cell research. Like what is inappropriate 
for human beings to be doing? How much interference with the natural 
order of things is acceptable to us? Some ethicists agree the idea 
of using cows to produce human cells could initially scare some people. 
You're not going to see minataurs walking around -- half human, half 
cow. That kind of thing is just not going to happen. What's going 
to happen is people are going to be uncomfortable with some of the 
science. They'll use their imaginations to think of reasons to inhibit 
the science. If the experiments move forward without complications, 
researchers estimate they're at least 10 to 15 years away from using 
the new cells to treat disease. The questions is, what medical and 
ethical complications might arise? Susan Candiotti, CNN, Miami.
