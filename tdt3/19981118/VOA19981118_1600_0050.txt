I am Dave DeForest, VOA News. President Clinton is flying to Japan 
and South Korea for discussions with leaders of both countries on 
pressing economic reforms and security concerns. As correspondent, 
Nick Simyon, at the White House reports, Mr. Clinton is expected to 
follow up on progress toward free trade he says was made at the just-concluded 
APEX Summit in Malaysia. As he left the White House for the long trip 
to Asia, the president told reporters he will be pushing for further 
steps to contain the Asian financial crisis and spur economic growth. 
Steps, which he says, will pay benefits to the world. Now in Japan 
and Korea, I will work for further progress. Nothing is more important 
than restoring stability and growth in Asia and efforts to restart 
Japan's economy. It has long been Asians, Asians' engine of growth. 
It is, as all of us know, the second largest economy in the world. 
But it has been stalled for five years. In South Korea, Mr. Clinton 
says his meetings with President Kim Dae-Jung will address critical 
security issues, including developments in North Korea, which he says 
could call into question Feong Yang's commitment to freezing its nuclear 
weapons programs. If Iraq's suspected weapons programs have been in 
the news, he says, we must be no less concerned about provocative 
activities in North Korea. Nick Simyon, VOA News, at the White House.
