More than 120 asylum seekers, including 20 babies, were left without 
a roof over their heads Wednesday when a voluntary group that said 
it could no longer afford to take care of them. As temperatures dropped, 
the refugees sat in buses or huddled around fires outside an asylum 
seeker's camp near the central Dutch city of Nijmegen. Although the 
camp had 500 free beds, it was not allowed to house the refugees, 
who fled to the Netherlands from countries all around the world, because 
the Dutch government has already refused to grant them asylum. Because 
the refugees had already had asylum applications rejected in other 
European Union nations before entering the Netherlands, they have 
no right to stay in this country. ``We can do no more. Our hands are 
empty,'' a spokeswoman for the Arnhem group that turned the refugees 
out told Dutch television news. The spokeswoman, identified only as 
I. Loeter, said her group wanted to bring the refugees' plight to 
the public's attention. Dutch parliament called an emergency late-night 
sitting Wednesday to discuss the matter. The refugees were heading 
to a Salvation Army center to seek shelter for the night. Providing 
accommodation for asylum seekers in this overcrowded nation reached 
crisis point recently when the government had to pitch tents because 
all other refugee centers were full. The move provoked a storm of 
protest, but while the protest has died down, the tents remain. Through 
September, 31,466 refugees applied for permission to stay in the Netherlands 
this year _ a 30 percent increase from the same period a year ago.
