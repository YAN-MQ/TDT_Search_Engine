President Clinton leaves the country just as a new chapter opens in 
the Monica Lewinski scandal. The revelation of her tape-recorded conversations 
describing her relationship with the President, set in motion a series 
of events leading to the impeachment inquiry now under way on Capital 
Hill. Tuesday the public heard those actual recordings for the first 
time. And on Thursday, the House of Representative's Judiciary Committee 
holds a hearing where special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr is expected 
to testify. VOA's national correspondent, Jim Malone, discussed this 
week's developments with News Now, host Tony Riggs. TONY RIGGS, VOA 
NEWS CORRESPONDENT. I think what is interesting is that, as we look 
ahead to the impeachment hearings on Thursday, now. There is a lot 
of back and forth between Republicans and Democrats about what is 
going to happen at that hearing, as you know, independent counsel 
Starr is supposed to testify. It will be his first major public appearance 
like this since he has been heading the investigation. And now some 
of the Democrats are making noises that, if the Republicans try to 
push this beyond the Lewinski affair into other things. Like campaign 
finance or the Webster-Hubble and White Water situations, that they 
may raise a stink and they may actually walk out of a committee hearing 
on Thursday. So we could actually have some political fireworks on 
Thursday, depending on how things go. It is starting to shape up fairly 
contentious. Is that what we might expect some fireworks on this? 
Well, the house Democratic Leader, Richard Gephardt, was at a news 
conference today saying that if the Republicans insist on raising 
issues outside of the Lewinski situation. Things like the White House 
use of FBI files, the firing of employees in the White House travel 
office, that in his words, the Democrats may decide not to go to the 
hearing. They could even decide to walk out. So, I think we are setting 
up now for fairly confrontational hearing, and I think a lot of this 
is now in the background of the election results. No Republican gains, 
the Democrats feel emboldened. They saw that as somewhat of a referendum 
on impeachment and that the country wants to move on. National correspondent, 
Jim Malone, he was speaking with News Now host, Tony Riggs, late on 
Tuesday.
