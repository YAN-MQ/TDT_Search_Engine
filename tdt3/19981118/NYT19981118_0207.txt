For all of their diversity, the streetscapes of New York City can 
be boiled down to a few representative elements: a yellow cab, a hot 
dog stand and a steaming manhole cover. Throw in a light-blue and 
white police car, and the location is fixed beyond all doubt. Only 
in New York, kids, only in New York. Unfortunately, that last component 
of the city's visual signature will soon go the way of all things. 
One by one, the NYPD's familiar patrol cars, Chevrolet Caprices painted 
white and a custom shade that the department calls ``grabber blue,'' 
are being replaced by lily-white Ford Crown Victorias. By 2000, when 
the transition is complete, New York will be a bit more like everywhere 
else. The new cars fall in line with a standard used throughout the 
nation: factory-painted white cars decorated with reflective decals, 
in this case two dark blue racing stripes, the department shield and 
a bold ``NYPD.'' The new car is an unlikely award winner. In the 1997 
Police Vehicle Design Contest, sponsored by Law and Order magazine, 
the NYPD won second prize, beating a white car with blue stripes from 
Little Rock, Ark., but losing to a white car with blue stripes from 
Lynnwood, Wash. William Flynn, executive director of support services 
for the Police Department, said the new color scheme was ``primarily 
an economic move.'' Each white car is about $800 cheaper to produce 
than the blue and white car it replaces, he says. But despite total 
savings in the millions of dollars _ the patrol cars' street life 
is only three years _ the introduction of the new design has been 
something of a stealth campaign. Police Commissioner Howard Safir 
approved the new cars in June 1996, and the first 200 or so rolled 
on to the streets with little fanfare in the spring of 1997. Half 
of the city's 1,700 patrol cars have now been replaced, but the new 
cars are still well below the radar of most New Yorkers. Allen Adamson, 
the managing director of the New York office of Landor Associates, 
a large graphic design firm responsible for the corporate identities 
of Federal Express, Xerox and Delta Air Lines, suggested that New 
Yorkers have been slow to notice the change because the cars were 
sending the wrong message. ``From a branding point of view, I think 
they made a mistake,'' he said. ``You want an image of toughness, 
but the new image is more suburban, more Mayberry. When I call the 
police in New York, I want Detective Sipowicz, not Andy Griffith.'' 
Curiously, the fearsome blue cars were originally part of a program 
to make the police more user-friendly. Benjamin Ward, police commissioner 
from 1984 to 1989, was serving as deputy commissioner for human relations 
when the color was adopted in 1973. ``Probably because the department 
had been Irish for so long, we all thought that green would be everybody's 
favorite color,'' he said. ``But research showed that baby blue was 
the most popular color in America.'' No formal studies were conducted 
to test public reaction to the all-white cars, but Hank Seiden, founder 
of the Seiden Group, a Manhattan-based marketing and advertising firm, 
worked with the department to develop the new look. Seiden also oversaw 
a more modest redesign of the patrol car graphics in the early 1990s, 
when the police introduced the bubble-headed Caprice but retained 
the distinctive grabber blue. Now, he is sorry to see them go. ``I 
designed those cars and I loved them,'' he said. ``The white car starts 
to look like thousands of other police forces. But I'm happy with 
the way they came out. It's a friendly car. It's like a guy on a white 
horse with a white hat.'' But the new cars may be too friendly, and 
too indistinct. Mark Lerner, the president of Epic Security, one of 
the city's largest private guard services, is concerned that people 
will mistake his white, blue-striped fleet for the new white, blue-striped 
police cars. Speaking in his academic capacity _ Lerner has a Ph.D. 
in criminology and has taught at John Jay College in Manhattan _ he 
said that the new cars would probably not make a difference in the 
way the police were perceived. But he worried that the department's 
distinctive edge had been lost. ``I think the old black, white and 
green cars from the 1960s had the most effective look. New York City 
should look different than other places.''
