European markets expected to make gains today in the wake of Tuesday's 
interest rate cut by the U.S. Central Bank. In Asia, reaction was 
positive, in Singapore, a key bank's cut of its own rate by 50 basis 
points, sent stocks there surging over three percent. Japan's Benchmark 
NIK gained over one percent to close at 14,600. It is their highest 
level in about a month as investors raise their hopes that Prime Minister, 
Keizo Obuchi, who unveiled a huge economic stimulus package will take 
additional steps to jump-start the world's second largest economy 
in recession now for more than a year. Stocks in Hong Kong and the 
Philippines also surged. Japan's two largest trading companies, Mitsubishi 
and Mitsui, said net income fell in the half-year ending September 
30, 1999. As falling demand in Asia led to a decline in machinery 
orders. Demand for machines and machine services has been falling 
in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand. The dollar 
was little changed in Asia trading from it's late Tuesday New York 
quote of 1.67 marks and 12.90 ATN.
