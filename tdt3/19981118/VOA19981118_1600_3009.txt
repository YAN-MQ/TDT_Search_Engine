In the United States, there are two basic types of bookstores, small 
independent shops, and the ever-expanding chain stores. Independent 
bookstores introduce new writers and ideas into communities. The mission 
statement of larger chain stores is to maximize profits. But the market 
for new books in the United States is limited and as Jan Sleuser reports, 
independent bookstores are losing the fight for consumers. In the 
past 10 years, book store chains such as Barnes & Noble and Borders 
Books have set up retail shops all over the nation. And they have 
been successful. With pleasant large spaces that offer a wide selection 
of popular titles and coffee bars where the customer can sit, sip 
a cappuccino, and read. The San Francisco-Bay Area Book Council is 
a nonprofit group that supports independent sellers. Each year the 
council produces a book festival. Executive director, Kathy Angus, 
says chain bookstores are excluded. Unlike any other place in the 
country, the Bay Area has a strong hold of independent booksellers. 
And we consider that to be a very precious thing. Because the chains 
have consistently been squeezing those bookstores out. Kathy Angus 
says well capitalized chain stores buy best sellers in volume and 
sell them at discount. Publishers also pay the chains to display their 
books in windows and place them prominently in stores. Unable to compete 
in the past five years, about one-fourth of all independent bookstores 
nationwide have gone out of business. For more than 20 years, Neil 
Sofman operated three independent bookstores in the Bay Area. This 
year he has had to close two after chain stores opened up nearby. 
The whole industry has changed in the last 10 years. There is not 
a bookseller in the country who is a good book seller that is not 
impacted. And there is not a reader in the country who is not impacted. 
Because there are dozens and dozens and dozens of books that have 
been canceled because the chain book buyer, the person responsible 
for buying the book, says I do not really want that book. The control 
over the flow of information in this country is dramatic and that 
frightens me. On behalf of independent bookstores, the American booksellers 
Association has filed a lawsuit against Barnes & Noble and Borders 
Books, charging that they are in violation of federal antitrust laws. 
The lawsuit claims that the chains have used their weight to force 
publishers to give them advantageous discounts not given independents. 
For VOA News Now, this is Jan Sleuser in San Francisco.
