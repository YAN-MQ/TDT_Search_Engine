Sir Paul McCartney will find an old friend at the induction ceremonies 
for the rock 'N' roll hall of fame next year -- sir George Martin. 
The legendary Beatles producer, who also changed the way record producers 
interact with the record labels, will be inducted in the nonperformer 
category. Don't tell the hall about the numerous times he played keyboards 
for the fabs.
