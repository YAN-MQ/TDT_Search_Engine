Microsoft Corp. has decided ``absolutely'' to continue to support 
the Java programming language in the wake of a ruling on Tuesday in 
which a U.S. judge ordered the company to change its Java software, 
a Microsoft executive said Wednesday. In a preliminary ruling, the 
judge found that Microsoft had violated its licensing contract with 
Sun Microsystems Inc., inventor of the Java language, by altering 
it so that it was tailored for Microsoft's Windows and incompatible 
with Sun's Java technology. Judge Ronald Whyte of U.S. District Court 
in San Jose, Calif., told Microsoft it could no longer ship the incompatible 
software and gave the company 90 days to comply with his order. After 
the ruling on Tuesday afternoon, Paul Maritz, a Microsoft group vice 
president, said the company was weighing its options and that ``the 
option of not supporting Java is open to us.'' But Tod Nielsen, Microsoft's 
general manager in charge of dealing with software developers, said 
the company was ``absolutely going to support Java, and we will support 
it as long as there is a desire for it,'' among programmers. Maritz's 
comment on Tuesday, Nielsen said, was intended as one of a number 
of ``hypothetical options'' available to Microsoft in the aftermath 
of the judge's ruling. The ruling does curb some of Microsoft's practices. 
For example, the company may not contractually require software developers 
to use Microsoft's version of Java exclusively, nor may Microsoft 
add commands to Java that result in programs that run only on Microsoft's 
Windows operating system. But the main element of the judge's order, 
according to Microsoft, is the requirement that the company include 
additional commands that make it compatible with Sun's Java standards. 
``Though there are some restrictions on what we can do,'' said Tom 
Burt, an associate general counsel for Microsoft, ``Microsoft still 
has the right to create its own version of Java.'' Rather than curbing 
its Java offerings, Nielsen said Microsoft would comply with the judge's 
order by giving ``software developers another choice'' among the Java 
options that the company includes in products like its Windows 98 
operating system and its Internet Explorer World Wide Web browser. 
Still, industry analysts expressed skepticism about Microsoft's court-ordered 
conversion to the virtues of offering more choice for the thousands 
of software developers who write programs in Java that are used for 
everything from animating Web sites to tracking stock prices. Microsoft, 
the analysts said, had tried to divide Java into different camps _ 
one aligned with Microsoft, one with Sun _ to undermine the Java threat 
to Microsoft. The appeal of Java is that it makes it easier to write 
programs that can run easily on different operating systems, thus 
weakening the advantage Microsoft enjoys now because most developers 
write programs tailored for its industry-standard Windows operating 
system. Many companies, including IBM Corp. and Novell, have licensed 
Sun's Java technology, and those companies are permitted to fine-tune 
Java as long as the additions do not make it incompatible with the 
core Java software. ``But the difference is that Microsoft tried to 
create incompatibilities,'' said Jeffrey Tarter, editor of Softletter, 
an industry newsletter. The court ruling could cause some uncertainty 
among software developers working with Microsoft's version of Java, 
Tarter said. Perhaps within a year or so, Tarter said, Microsoft will 
likely regain its influence over the growing community of Java programmers 
by re-engineering Java so that it can do whatever it wants with it. 
In this process of ``cloning'' software, engineers who have not had 
access to Sun's Java programming code are given specifications about 
what tasks the cloned Java should perform and then told to write code 
that performs those tasks. The resulting product, Tarter said, would 
be intended to run existing Java programs but also to run far better 
than Sun's version on computers using Microsoft's Windows operating 
system. ``Microsoft got its start doing a knock-off of the old Basic 
operating system, so that kind of reverse engineering is totally in 
character,'' Tarter said. Nielsen of Microsoft said there were no 
current plans for cloning Java, and he described that option as a 
``long-term technical issue.'' By requiring Microsoft to offer Java 
that is compatible with Sun's standards, the California court order 
is likely to make it more difficult for Microsoft to use its dominance 
of personal computing software to bend Java in its direction. ``It 
really forces Microsoft to compete on the merits of the product, and 
these days it rarely does that,'' said Richard Shaffer, a principal 
of Technologic Partners, a technology consulting firm in New York. 
``Typically, Microsoft's enormous market power gives it a huge advantage.'' 
For his part, Nielsen of Microsoft said, ``We feel pretty confident 
about our ability to write software.'' Michael Morris, Sun's general 
counsel, said the court order was intended to make the playing field 
level for all companies in the Java market. ``If Microsoft is happy 
with that, I'm delighted,'' Morris said.
