hard times in russia have deprived many children of a childhood. kids 
are on the streets, trying to make money any way they can and social 
workers can't reach them all. betsy aaron looks at what's become an 
almost impossible job for everyone. what do you do when you're a kid 
and your parents send you out to make some money? you wash car windows. 
it doesn't matter how old you are. it doesn't matter that you should 
probably be in school. genya's 10, and she brags that in one day she 
once made 125,000 rubles, about $10, washing windows. "yeah, i live 
at home," she says. "but sometimes i have to hang out." "we all used 
to sniff glue," he says. "but now we quit, except for maybe one girl." 
they smoke. what about beer? that happens. social workers, many of 
them still in school, spend their time on the streets trying to reach 
these kids. what these kids need is attention. nobody's taking care 
of them. too many parents are alcoholics or drug addicts or just desperate 
with no jobs and no home and no prospects. you know, sometimes dad 
starts yelling at me, and i just go out. one day, these kids were 
told they were going to meet a very important person, the head of 
unicef, the woman in charge of kids at the united nations. so genya 
and the others told their stories, and so did the social workers. 
it's really hard to convince those kids that we're not from the police, 
that we won't report them. are there any services that you can try 
and connect their families up with sometimes? there are government 
structures. but they have a repressive character -- the so-called 
"commission for juveniles." unicef provides some money for what it 
sees as a growing problem on the streets. the goal is to get to the 
kids before they get to the streets. sometimes the lost kids end up 
in shelters. slava is 8. three months ago, his mother left him, saying 
she'd be back in a week. vasily can't stay at home because he doesn't 
have one. what do you do when you just can't remember the last time 
you saw your mother? my mom used to work, and now she's gone. bridget's 
mother died of a drug overdose. ask any of them what they want. "a 
family," they say. "a home," they say. i have a dream. i want to grow 
up as soon as possible. "because," she says, "it's sad being a little 
girl." betsy aaron, cnn, moscow.
