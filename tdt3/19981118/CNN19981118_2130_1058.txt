If you have some old frequent-flier miles with Delta you may have 
a free trip just waiting for you. Kalin Thomas-Samuel explains in 
this edition of "working ahead." In January, Delta airlines expects 
court approval to settle a Class action suit that was filed against 
the airline ten years ago. Under the terms of the settlement, frequent 
flier members who had at least 40,000 miles prior to July 1988 are 
due a package of benefits. Either a coupon good for a discount off 
of a future flight, or a certain number of frequent flier miles to 
be used to redeem for a future flight. Take the miles, they'll go 
into your account, and you can go to Hawaii for free. But some travelers 
haven't even read the Delta statements sent to them in the mail, let 
alone signed the claim form to join the suit. I've already got probably 
more miles than I will use for a long time, and it's really not that 
important to me, I guess. And it'll be difficult for travelers to 
use extra bonus miles they might get in a settlement. Since today, 
there are 22 million sky miles members, all vying for about the same 
amount of free seats that were available ten years ago. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, 
CNN, Atlanta.
