Livent Inc., the troubled Canadian theater company, may have to consider 
filing for bankruptcy protection, according to officials of two credit-rating 
agencies that have downgraded the company's debt rating. The company's 
problems have been in the spotlight since co-founder Garth Drabinsky, 
producer of ``Ragtime,'' ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and other hit 
musicals, was suspended in August after an investigation by Livent's 
new managers led to allegations of financial irregularities. Drabinsky 
and business partner Myron Gottlieb have denied any wrongdoing. Livent's 
new management team is headed by former Walt Disney executive Michael 
Ovitz and New York investment banker Roy Furman. Standard and Poor's 
and Moody's Investors Service said Tuesday's downgrades reflect uncertainty 
about Livent's ability to pay its debts amid speculation that it might 
soon seek protection from creditors in U.S. and Canadian bankruptcy 
courts. ``It's looking more and more like they will have no alternative 
to filing'' for bankruptcy protection, said Russ Solomon, a vice president 
at Moody's in New York. Livent's board of directors met Tuesday in 
Toronto to discuss their financial dilemma and issued a brief statement 
saying they ``were carefully exploring the company's options.'' Analysts 
say one alternative to seeking bankruptcy protection would be selling 
the company, but Livent's management has acknowledged having difficulty 
getting a clear picture of its financial condition. Moody's, in a 
statement, said it was concerned about the ``multitude'' of class 
action lawsuits filed against Livent and ``evidence of a fundamental 
deterioration of the company's business performance.'' Ed Lawrence, 
a director at Standard and Poor's in Toronto, said Livent's credit 
ratings were dropped from single-B plus to triple-C, a sign that its 
ability to meet its debts is ``very vulnerable.'' Filing for bankruptcy 
protection would give Livent time to come up with a restructuring 
plan aimed at preventing the company from being devoured by its creditors.
