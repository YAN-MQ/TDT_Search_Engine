Belgium, co-organizer and automatic qualifier for the European Championships 
2000, struggled to a goalless draw against the part-timers of Luxembourg 
Wednesday, a result which is bound to increase criticism of coach 
Georges Leekens. What was expected to be a session of target practice 
turned into a struggle for Belgium, which was fielding a young and 
inexperienced team in the exhibition game. Luxembourg is last in Euro 
2000 qualifying Group 5 after losses against Poland and England. Belgium 
had made wholesale changes to the team since this summer's disappointing 
World Cup and counted on Johan Walem of Udinese to push the team forward 
and orchestrate the attack. It didn't happen. On a frozen pitch, Belgium 
failed to create many chances against a well-organized Luxembourg 
defense. Luxembourg, relying on a plucky team of part-timers, almost 
went ahead in the 67th minute when forward Paolo Amodio exploited 
a Belgian defensive error and broke through on his own but he put 
his shot wide. It was Belgium's first game since it tumbled out of 
the first round of the World Cup without a single win to its credit. 
Leekens has weeded out a slew of veterans but youth failed to turn 
Belgium's fortunes around Wednesday. Lineups : Luxembourg : Paul Koch; 
Laurent Deville, Nico Funck, Jeff Strasser, Vanek, Marc Birsens; Jeff 
Saibene, Luc Holtz , Manuel Cardoni, Patrick Posing, Marcel Christophe 
(58, Paolo Amodio). Belgium : Ronald Gaspercic; Eric Deflandre (72, 
Tjorven De Brul), Glen De Boeck, Gordan Vidovic, Nico Van Kerckhoven 
(60, Davy Oyen); Philippe Clement, Christiaan Janssens, Johan Walem; 
Sven Vermant, Gert Claessens, Bob Peeters (60, Mbo Mpenza).
