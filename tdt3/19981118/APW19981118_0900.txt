In the first major arms deal by post apartheid South Africa, the government 
on Wednesday gave preliminary approval to a 29.77 billion-rand (dlrs 
5.22 billion) package of jet fighters, submarines and other equipment. 
The proposal includes 28 Gripen jet fighters from Saab/British Aerospace 
of Sweden and England, three submarines and four corvette warships 
from German consortiums, 40 light utility helicopters from Italian 
manufacturer Agusta and 24 Hawk-100 jet trainers from British Aerospace. 
Critics say it's wrong for the rainbow nation to spend so much on 
weapons given the country's problems with poverty and 34 percent unemployment. 
Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Njongonkulu Ndungane has said the 
money is ``desperately needed for reconstruction and development'' 
after decades of apartheid rule that systematically denied the non-white 
majority good housing, education and jobs. But defense officials say 
the package will generate 65,000 new jobs and a transfer of technology 
resulting from 110 billion rand (dlrs 19.3 billion) in investments 
promised by the countries selling the arms. The new equipment is needed 
to replace obsolete armaments from the heavily militarized apartheid 
government that left power after the first democratic elections in 
1994, said Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils in an SABC radio 
interview on Wednesday. South Africa can ``go into the next century 
with a new defense force capable ... of protecting our sovereignty 
and people,'' Kasrils said. As an increasingly dominant regional military 
power, other African countries are also looking to South Africa for 
help in brokering the continent's ongoing conflicts. The contracts 
attracted intense bidding despite strings attached. The government 
is requiring that countries wishing to sell weapons must invest an 
amount at least equal to the purchase price into high technology industry 
here. Government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said the finance minister 
and a Cabinet subcommittee would negotiate further with the suppliers 
over the coming weeks and possibly reduce the number of items being 
purchased. Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has raised questions about 
the affordability, local newspapers reported this week. Swedish Ambassador 
Paul Heineback said he expected ``very tough'' negotiations over Sweden's 
investment, but added, ``I'm quite confident there will be final agreement.'' 
The government placed the costs of the Gripen jets at 10.875 billion 
rand (dlrs 1.91 billion), the largest component of the procurement. 
The price of the corvettes was 6 billion rand (dlrs 1.05 billion), 
and 5.212 billion rand (dlrs 914.4 million) for the subs. The German 
consortium includes Thyssen AG, Blohm and Voss AG and Preussag AG. 
The package would also include 4.728 billion rand (dlrs 838.6 million) 
for the Hawks; 2.168 billion rand (dlrs 380.4 million) for the Agusta 
helicopters; and 787 million rand (dlrs 138 million) for four maritime 
helicopters from GKN Westland of the United Kingdom.
