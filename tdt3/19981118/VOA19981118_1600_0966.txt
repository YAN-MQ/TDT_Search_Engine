A prominent U.S. Senator, Democrat Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, says 
the United States has an urgent national security interest in helping 
Russia reduce its nuclear arsenal ahead of schedule. Senator Kerrey 
says he wants President Clinton and Congress to agree on accelerating 
the dismantling of U.S. nuclear missiles. He says this would give 
Russia the incentive it is looking for to downsize its own arsenal 
faster, before losing control of it. The Stark One Arms Control Agreement 
calls on the United States and Russia to each cut their arsenal to 
6,000 warheads. Senator Kerrey says that total is necessary for security. 
He recommends cutting the weapons at a more rapid pace to a level 
of about 2,000.
