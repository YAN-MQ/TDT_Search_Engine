The legal fate of a Kurdish leader jailed in Italy and wanted by Turkey, 
is causing rallies and hunger strikes in various cities across Europe. 
Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, is being held by Italian authorities. 
Italy said Tuesday, it will not extradite him because Turkey might 
put him on trial for terrorism and treason, and he could be executed. 
More than 10,000 Kurds marched in Rome to demand political asylum 
for Mr. Ocalan. More than 4,000 Kurds demonstrated in Bonn. And in 
Moscow, two Kurds set themselves on fire outside the parliament.
