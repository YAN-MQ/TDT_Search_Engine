A rare 300-year-old Stradivari violin fetched 529,500 pounds (dlrs 
884,000) at auction Wednesday. The Joachim Kortschak, named after 
two of its previous owners, was bought at Christie's by an anonymous 
telephone bidder, the auction house said. Christie's pre-sale estimate 
had been between 500,000 pounds (dlrs 835,000) and 700,000 pounds 
(dlrs 1.2 million) following a sale in April when the Kreutzer Stradivari 
sold for 947,000 pounds (dlrs 1.6 million), making it the world's 
most valuable instrument. The Joachim Kortschak, which had never before 
come to auction, is in fine condition and ``an important example of 
the `long pattern' Stradivari,'' the auction house said. Antonio Stradivari 
(1644-1737) first won fame as an instrument maker in the 1680s, and 
gained a reputation for experimenting with new violin designs. A total 
of 650 instruments made by him have survived, including violins, violas, 
cellos and harps.
