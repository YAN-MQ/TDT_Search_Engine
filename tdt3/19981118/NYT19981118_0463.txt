A merger that would have created a giant media services agency, ranking 
among the world's three largest, has unexpectedly been called off. 
Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago and MacManus Group in New York said Wednesday 
that they had ended almost a year of negotiations to combine their 
media operations. The talks began by exploring a merger outside the 
United States, then expanded into a proposed worldwide venture that 
would have encompassed planning and buying for television, radio, 
print, the Internet and other media. Such a merger of the operations 
_ Starcom Media Services, owned by Burnett, and Televest, part of 
MacManus _ would have brought under one roof media accounts with billings 
estimated at $12 billion for marketers like Allstate, Amoco, Diageo 
PLC., the M&AMP;M/Mars unit of Mars Inc., the Paramount Pictures unit 
of Viacom Inc., J.C. Penney, Philip Morris and Procter &AMP; Gamble. 
The merger discussions were indicative of a boom that is altering 
Madison Avenue as more agencies spin off their media services functions 
into stand-alone units like Televest; Starcom; the Media Edge, part 
of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.; and Mediacom Worldwide, owned by Grey 
Advertising. Such spinoffs are intended to compete against huge media-only 
agencies like Carat International, a unit of Aegis Group PLC, and 
Zenith Media Services, owned by Cordiant Communications Group PLC 
and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC. But the abrupt halt to the talks is 
a reminder that even as merger mania sweeps the agency industry, not 
every deal envisioned will be done. ``We announced our engagement 
and called off the marriage,'' said Roy J. Bostock, chairman and chief 
executive of MacManus, in a telephone interview. MacManus also owns 
such agencies as D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications 
and N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners. ``We knew going in that we had different 
organizational ideas but thought we would be able to overcome those 
differences,'' he said. ``We simply weren't able to, so we decided 
to go our separate ways.'' Richard B. Fizdale, Burnett chairman and 
chief executive, echoed those thoughts in a separate interview. ``Both 
companies are very good at what we do,'' Fizdale said, ``but we go 
about doing it in different ways that were very difficult to pull 
together.'' ``Those difficulties were exacerbated in the USA,'' he 
added, ``because as we got to major, more sophisticated markets, the 
issues we faced became less simple.'' Roger A. Haupt, vice chairman 
and chief operating officer at Burnett, who joined Fizdale for the 
interview, said: ``It's a very large and complex operation to try 
and bring together in 84 countries two companies that over time developed 
differently. We came to the conclusion that proceeding would ultimately 
not be in our best interest.'' And there may not be anything wrong 
with that. ``I would congratulate both of them for not doing this 
deal,'' said Joe Mandese, editor of The Myers Report, a media newsletter 
published by Myers Consulting Group LLC in New York, ``because it 
was hard to imagine these two together.'' A merger ``would have produced 
a very strange animal,'' he said, because the media services agencies 
are ``the antithesis'' of each other. Mandese praised Televest as 
``being the best `commodities' buyer in the business'' with ``tough 
negotiators'' who concentrate on purchasing television commercial 
time ``efficiently and cost effectively.'' He described Starcom as 
``strategically driven,'' focusing on ``creating a sense of brand 
with original research and proprietary technology.'' The discussions 
to link Starcom and Televest were closely watched because of speculation 
that a combination would presage a merger of Burnett and MacManus; 
both are privately owned, and they share clients such as Coca-Cola, 
General Motors and P &AMP; G. The no-go disclosure came as a surprise 
because trade publications had reported that the negotiations were 
fairly far along. But in a joint statement, Bostock and Fizdale said 
that top executives had made a ``mutual decision'' against merging. 
``While we have a great deal of respect for one another,'' Fizdale 
and Bostock said in the statement, ``we had enough fundamental differences 
of opinion on how best to run such a massive operation, especially 
in the U.S., that we have chosen not to move forward.'' Asked about 
suggestions that personnel issues helped derail the merger, Bostock 
said in the telephone interview, ``We never got to who would do what'' 
because ``we never got past the organizational issue.'' Irwin Gotlieb 
is president and chief executive of Televest and Jack Klues, an executive 
vice president at Burnett, is chairman of Starcom. Despite the scrapping 
of the merger, which would have created a media services behemoth 
with the likely name of Starvest, Bostock said that ``global media 
consolidation is going to continue.'' In fact, he added, MacManus 
would now revive plans, which had been tabled during the merger talks, 
to ``develop our own independent global media company,'' effective 
Jan. 1. The stand-alone unit would combine Televest, which covers 
the United States, with media services operations in markets like 
Europe. As for Starcom, any fallout from the merger's abandonment 
is being cushioned by a skein of recent media assignments from large 
marketers like Diageo, with billings estimated at $150 million; Sara 
Lee Corp., with billings estimated at $100 million, and Walgreen Co., 
with billings estimated at $40 million. A Starcom sibling, LB Media 
in London, was named to handle the consolidated British television 
buying account for Procter &AMP; Gamble, with billings estimated at 
$287 million. Televest has also recently gained a plum assignment; 
Coca-Cola formally named the agency to help develop a worldwide television 
programming strategy. Kari Bjorhus, manager for marketing communications 
at Coca-Cola in Atlanta, confirmed a report of the assignment this 
week in the trade publication Advertising Age. Televest will seek 
television series in various markets, beginning in Europe, for Coca-Cola 
to buy or sponsor. Shows would be licensed to television networks 
in exchange for advertising time.
