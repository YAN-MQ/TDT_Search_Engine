I am Robert Burns, VOA News. President Clinton, departing for a trip 
to Asia, has called on Japan to take decisive steps to repair its 
economy saying the key to recovery in the region lies with Japan. 
Speaking at the White House Wednesday morning, the president said 
he will hear Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi's plans to spur growth. 
In meetings with Prime Minister Obuchi, a town hall with Japanese 
citizens, and other settings. I look forward to discussing how Japan 
can promptly and effectively implement its commitment to banking reform, 
stimulate consumer demand and growth, deregulate key economic sectors, 
and open its markets to fair trade. Mr. Obuchi unveiled a huge stimulus 
plan Monday to try to combat Japan's worst recession since World War 
II. President Clinton said he also looks forward to talks with South 
Korean leader, Kim Dae-Jung, on joint security concerns about North 
Korea's nuclear program.
