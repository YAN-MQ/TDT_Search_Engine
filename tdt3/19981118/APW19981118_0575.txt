Germany's new center-left government faces a weakening economy which 
it so far hasn't done much to boost, the government's council of economic 
advisers said Wednesday in an often critical report. Global economic 
instability and uncertainty at home about the government's plans are 
the twin risks facing the Europe's biggest economy, the panel said. 
``We don't expect a fundamental worsening in the economy, but with 
the risks there are, development will be noticeably weaker,'' the 
report said. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the report ``helpful.'' 
He jokingly defended his government, saying it hadn't gotten the customary 
100 days to get its agenda under way since taking office Oct. 27 ``We're 
really proud that we're considered so good that the grace period was 
shortened to suit us,'' Schroeder said as he received the report in 
Bonn. Schroeder said he was pleased the report had praised his government's 
pet project _ round-table talks with industry and labro to brainstorm 
on cutting unemployment _ and a planned tax on energy, which many 
industry leaders have sharply criticized. Germany's economic growth 
will slow to an estimated 2 percent in 1999, from 2.75 percent this 
year, the report said. It described Germany's jobs situation as ``dramatic'' 
with unemployment at 10.1 percent. But it warned against the government's 
plan to stimulate the economy with more generous monetary and fiscal 
policies, saying that only long-term, pro-market reforms could get 
the huge base of jobless back to work. Germany already faces the risk 
of higher budget deficits after Europe's single currency kicks in, 
the panel said. Failure by Schroeder to cut costly social welfare 
programs would reverse a trend of falling deficits pushed through 
in Germany to help make the euro a stable currency for its Jan. 1 
debut, it said. Germany's budget deficit will be 1.9 percent of gross 
domestic product this year, dropping to 1.8 percent in 1999, the report 
said. But the panel said the trend won't hold, citing Germany's costly 
social safety net. Schroeder's government had failed to make clear 
how it will meet promises for rigor in government spending, the report 
said. Government actions so far _ including pressure on central bankers 
to lower interest rate and attempts to increase Germans' spending 
power with tax cuts _ were ``not designed to counter uncertainty among 
investors and consumers.'' ``Financial policy therefore is not making 
the necesary contribution to a stabilization of expectations,'' the 
report added. The panel warned against attempts by the Finance Minister 
Oskar Lafontaine to persuade the new European Central Bank, which 
is launching the euro, to deviate from its strict path of low inflation 
and price stability. Lafontaine wants the bank to help governments 
fight flagging growth and high joblessness by cutting interest rates. 
A more expansive monetary policy could lead to higher money market 
rates and destabilize the economy, whereas the ECB would win trust 
in the new currency by providing a stable environment, the report 
said.
