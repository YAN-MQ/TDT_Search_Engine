Lot more ahead as we continue this evening. Two men survive, the others 
are out. The republicans who have spoken on who they want to speak 
for them on the hill. Now what about the head of the national party? 
Also from "dateline NBC" tonight, what has changed since 1974? Only 
the room remains exactly the same. And later on, how the next drama 
is shaping up now in Iraq. After Iraq came within 30 minutes of getting 
hit.
