More legal woes for Microsoft. A California court has ordered Microsoft 
to redesign its software to be compatible with sun microsystem's Java 
programming language. Fred Katayama explains what the move means for 
the future of the software industry. Sun contended that Microsoft 
had violated a licensing agreement by making its own versions of Java 
that fail sun's kpatability tests. Microsoft said compliance was not 
a problem, and assured consumers they need not worry. Within 90 days, 
we're reviewing what it will take to comply, but we fully believe 
we can add this support for this one feet clur and make it available 
so that none of our customers will be impacted. Sun said in a statement, 
that it is extremely pleased by the court's move to issue an injunction. 
Some industry watchers feel Java threatens Microsoft because programs 
written there are supposed to run on any type of computer system. 
Sun contends Microsoft's version is designed to run on computers using 
microsoft's windows or its Internet browser. One analyst felt the 
injunction could infwluns the judge overseeing the antitrust suit 
against Microsoft in Washington. This is a coordinated effort by Microsoft's 
"enemies" to attack them in court. This happened to be a successful 
entry and, therefore, someone like judge jackson, who has shown propensity 
in the past to rule negatively, could perhaps rule negatively in the 
future. Some analysts predict Microsoft will comply with the judge's 
order. But still file an appeal, claiming it has a right to alter 
Java as it sees fit. Fred Katayama, "CNN Financial News," New York.
