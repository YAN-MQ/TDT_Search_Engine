At the news conference at Shea Stadium Wednesday announcing his second 
coming as a Met, Bobby Bonilla remarked that, well, yes, controversy 
``seems to follow me; I don't know why.'' Oh, someone asked, kind 
of like Albert Belle? For Albert Belle, the knight errant of the White 
Sox, has, strangely enough, been on the minds of New York baseball 
fans of late. ``No! No!'' cried Bonilla, thrusting his arms in the 
air in the classic I'm-not-guilty mode. ``Hold on! Time out! Not like 
that at all.'' While Bonilla has found himself in hot water at times 
because, as he said, ``I put my foot in my mouth a couple of times, 
and I couldn't hold my temper a few times,'' his problems were unlike 
those of Belle, who not only verbally but also physically abused people, 
from throwing baseballs at cameramen to using a sports utility vehicle 
to chase after and perhaps recklessly frighten kids who had been playing 
a Halloween prank on him at his home. Nonetheless, Belle is apparently 
being courted by the Yankees _ there he was the other day, for example, 
playing golf with no less a personage than Yankees Manager Joe Torre. 
Can the Yankees be serious in opting to sign Belle to their outfield 
and allow Bernie Williams, the superb performer and sterling citizen, 
to depart the center-field pasture at Yankee Stadium? Is this just 
a ploy to make Williams understand that he and his family will not 
starve at the reported offer of wages by the Yankees of nearly $60 
million for five years? Bonilla, the first time around at a Met, arrived 
in 1992 as a savior of sorts for the embattled Queens team. And was 
he ever going to enjoy himself. He knew New York was going to be a 
tough town, but he figured he could handle it _ after all, he grew 
up in the Bronx. Turns out he couldn't quite handle it. ``No one's 
going to wipe this smile off my face,'' he said famously at the first 
news conference. His smile disappeared. When that last quotation was 
about to be repeated to him Wednesday, he cut the sentence off at 
the pass. ``I'm not going to get into that one,'' he said, smiling. 
Bonilla said he has learned from his three and a half years as a Met. 
He said he has grown from it, and hopes to profit from that education. 
``It's going to be different this time,'' he said. And well it might 
be. Bonilla showed up the last time carrying the burden of being the 
man to change the fortunes of the Mets single-handedly, and, as a 
switch-hitter, from either side of the plate, too. Now he has star-quality 
operatives like Mike Piazza and John Olerud and Rey Ordonez and Al 
Leiter to share the pressures of seeking a National League East flag. 
Bonilla, 35, recalled a column in The Daily News in his first Met 
years depicting him as a baby and an accompanying cartoon showing 
him in a diaper. It was upsetting then, but he said he can laugh at 
himself now. He also spoke about dealing with controversial topics 
in an honest, straightforward manner. But he did not seem to come 
clean when asked about quotes attributed to him the other day in The 
Los Angeles Times criticizing Tommy Lasorda, who was the general manager 
of the Dodgers part of last season after Bonilla was traded to the 
team. He said he was misquoted. One was reminded of when Reggie Jackson 
joined the Yankees and said in a magazine article that he was ``the 
straw that stirred the drink,'' and offended his teammate Thurman 
Munson. Another Yankee, seeking to take the edge off the comment, 
said to Munson, ``Maybe it was taken out of context.'' ``For six pages?'' 
Munson replied. Bonilla Wednesday also said about Belle: ``He can 
play. And he could deal with New York. He'd get lost on the Yankees. 
They've got a lot of wonderful players there. But New York likes someone 
like him. He creates controversy. They like when it gets crazy. But 
at the end of the year, they'd say: `He hit 50 homers. He's a pretty 
good player.' '' And, as it is said, so it goes. It is no secret in 
sports that if you can produce to make your team win, then those involved 
in the team's fortunes will forgive most if not all of your sins. 
Fans could easily come to love the sneer of Fatuous Albert. When he 
was the belle of ball in Cleveland, he was routinely getting standing 
ovations. If Bonilla returns to health _ and he says the Achilles' 
heel, sore left wrist and abdominal problems that put a crimp into 
last season for him and his batting average (.249) are substantially 
better _ and returns to bashing baseballs, it won't matter what he 
says about Lasorda or anyone else, the fans will be smiling, even 
if he isn't.
