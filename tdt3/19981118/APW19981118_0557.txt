Questions about human rights and Malaysia's treatment of its jailed 
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim dogged Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad until the final moments of a Pacific Rim summit Wednesday. 
Brusque replies by Mahathir underlined the irritation of Malaysian 
officials to the issues that sidetracked attention from trade liberalization 
at the meeting of 21 world leaders. When a reporter asked him whether 
his daughter's newspaper column condemning an anti-homosexual movement 
had created tensions in his family -- Anwar is on trial for homosexual 
acts -- Mahathir snapped that he did not want to discuss family. To 
a query about police violence, he said: ``If they (demonstrators) 
beat up the police, are you expecting police to submit to their beating?'' 
The United States' strong support for Anwar demonstrated by Vice President 
Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during the summit 
angered Malaysia. Then the anti-government protests embarrassed it. 
On Wednesday, the final summit document did little to make Mahathir 
feel better when it did not accommodate his strong views on curbing 
currency trading. It rejected calls for stiffer regulation of foreign 
exchange trading or new controls on the movement of short-term capital. 
But it did call for a review of the practices of international credit 
rating agencies. Mahathir has angrily charged in recent days that 
the agencies downgrade the debt of developing countries arbitrarily, 
without proper review. Mahathir said the statement had to focus on 
``the central issues that are of concern to all parties.'' ``I think 
it was a successful meeting.'' Mahathir denied that relations with 
the United States had chilled after the APEC summit, during which 
Gore refused to meet him. But he refused to comment on Gore's speech 
that highlighted the need for democracy and freedom of expression 
to make an economy healthy. Gore snubbed Mahathir again by walking 
out of a dinner after making the speech. ``Whatever comments need 
to be made about the speech have been made,'' he said, quickly moving 
on to the next question. Asked about Canadian Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien's refusal to meet him over the same issue, Mahathir said: 
``How could I meet all the visiting leaders.'' Mahathir hit back as 
reporters persisted with questions about Anwar and Malaysia's democracy. 
``A number of leaders did mention that the foreign media is short 
on facts and more concerned with propagating their viewpoints,'' he 
sniffed. Mahathir said one leader told him ``I am surprised to see 
no soldiers and tanks on the road. We were told by the press that 
the place is, you know, in flames,'' he said. He did not name the 
leader.
