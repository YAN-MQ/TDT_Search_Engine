U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq are back at work. A U.N. spokesman 
says the group went out on a routine inspection and reported no problems. 
Officials say the inspectors will probably limit visits to sites where 
cameras and sensors for long-term monitoring have been installed. 
They say things might become more interesting later, when surprise 
checks on suspected weapons sites are held.
