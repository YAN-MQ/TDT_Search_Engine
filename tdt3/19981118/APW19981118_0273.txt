The international Red Cross said Wednesday it has been asked to set 
up a security perimeter around a meeting this week between Zapatista 
rebels and congressional mediators in the southern Mexican state of 
Chiapas. It also has been asked to transport rebel representatives 
to the talks planned for Friday and Sunday in San Cristobal de las 
Casas, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement. 
The operation will start Thursday with Zapatista representatives being 
transferred from the villages of Oventic, La Garrucha and La Realidad, 
it added. The congressional committee, known as Cocopa, had planned 
to meet the rebels earlier this month in the jungle hamlet of La Realidad. 
But the Zapatistas called that meeting off, saying they couldn't attend 
because of heightened military patrols near the planned meeting site. 
The Zapatista rebels rose briefly in arms in 1994, demanding democracy 
and better conditions for the impoverished indigenous population of 
Chiapas. Peace talks between the government and the rebels have been 
stalled since 1996, when President Ernesto Zedillo's administration 
refused to honor a partial peace accord signed by government representatives. 
This week's operation will involve 11 ICRC delegates and some 100 
Mexican Red Cross volunteers, who will help with the security cordon, 
the ICRC said. After the 1994 rebellion, the ICRC supported medical 
care efforts and also served as escort for Zapatista delegates attending 
peace talks with the government. Some Mexican officials were uncomfortable 
with the ICRC role, arguing that the conflict was a Mexican affair 
that should not involve international agencies. Its activity tailed 
off sharply after mid-1995. In May, the ICRC reached a new agreement 
with the Mexican government allowing it to resume humanitarian activities 
in Chiapas.
