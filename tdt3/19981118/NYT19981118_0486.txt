Annika Sorenstam has a simple goal this week. She wants to end another 
great season with another impressive victory. Sorenstam wants to end 
the official Ladies Professional Golf Association season by winning 
the PageNet Tour Championship, which begins Thursday at the Desert 
Inn Golf Club. It has been another memorable year for Sorenstam, who 
at age 28 has a chance to capture a rare triple crown _ the money 
title, the Rolex Player of the Year Award, and the Vare Trophy for 
lowest scoring average. Sorenstam won all three honors in 1995. With 
$1,077,498 in winnings, Sorenstam has already clinched the money title. 
Meanwhile, she has virtually clinched the scoring average race (69.88) 
over Dottie Pepper (70.44), and Sorenstam also leads the points standings 
for player of the year. Se Ri Pak is in second place for that honor, 
but Sorenstam will win the award unless Pak wins the Tour Championship 
and Sorenstam finishes lower than third. If Sorenstam shoots a four-round 
score of 284 or better, she will become the first LPGA player to finish 
the season with a scoring average under 70. And Sorenstam is well-rested 
and confident, with fond memories of winning last year's Tour Championship 
in a sudden-death playoff against Lorie Kane and Pat Hurst. ``This 
is a special event, and I love the golf course,'' said Sorenstam of 
the Desert Inn's par-72, 6,373-yard layout. ``It's tricky, it's narrow, 
it's long. I'm looking forward to playing it,'' she said, adding, 
``If it's windy, it will be difficult. It's a narrow course to begin 
with, and the greens are fast. ``This is a big event for me _ a lot 
can be decided this week. I've had a lot of time to practice the last 
few weeks, so I'm as ready as I can be.'' While Sorenstam is one of 
the favorites, the competition should be intense in a field reserved 
for the year's top 30 money winners. Dale Eggeling, 31st on the money 
list, will replace the pregnant Tammie Green, 19th in earnings. There 
are six players in the field who have won at least twice this year 
_ Kelly Robbins, Karrie Webb, Liselotte Neumann, Danielle Ammaccapane, 
Pak and Sorenstam. Pak has won four times this year, including two 
majors _ the McDonald's LPGA Championship and the United States Women's 
Open.
