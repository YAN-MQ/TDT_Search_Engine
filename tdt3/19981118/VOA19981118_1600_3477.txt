A U.S. scientist says he thinks he has found a fossil sample from 
a meteorite that slammed into earth 65 million years ago leading to 
the demise of the dinosaurs. The scientist says he believes the tiny 
fossil fragment is from a meteorite that hit Mexico's Yucatan peninsula 
all those years ago. He says the fossil strongly supports the idea 
that what hit the peninsula was not a comet, but an asteroid. A piece 
of largely rocky material. The finding supports the scientific theory 
that a massive asteroid collision caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 
and many other species.
