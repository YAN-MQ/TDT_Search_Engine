In vista, California, 20-year-old Brandon Wilson stunned a crowded 
courtroom today when he confessed to killing a little boy. Wilson 
is accused of slashing -year-old Matthew cecchi's throat in a public 
restroom on Saturday. At his arraignment Wilson told the judge he 
was responsible. I'm guilty. I want to talk myself. I did it. I killed 
him. I killed the little boy. We request, your honor, that the defendant 
be removed from the courtroom. Well, no, he's not going to be removed. 
Don't say anything else at this point. Wilson, a drifter from Wisconsin, 
is charged with murder with special circumstances, qualifying him 
for the death penalty if convicted. He was arrested Monday. Police 
say Wilson told them he planned to keep on killing until he was stopped.
