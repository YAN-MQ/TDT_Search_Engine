Italy says it will not extradite jailed Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah 
Ocalan, to Tokyo where he faces terrorism charges and could be executed. 
Tuesday's announcement by the Italian Prime Minister came as thousands 
of Kurds marched in Rome to demand political asylum for Mr. Ocalan. 
Kurds throughout Europe are staging rallies to oppose Turkey's extradition 
request.
