A putrid smell drifts around a torn bag of plastic dinosaurs, pulled 
from the dirt of the hillside. Then a headless rag doll emerges. The 
family must be close. Barry Sessions scrapes away damp earth with 
his trenching tool and uncovers a bag of baby clothes. A tiny sky-blue 
knit vest hangs out. Evidence of a life blinked out by Hurricane Mitch. 
``It was a mother, a grandmother and four children. They slept in 
the same bed, like piglets,'' he says. That bit was learned from the 
neighbors, who managed to escape Mitch's wrath. Sessions is one of 
10 volunteers from England's Rescue and Preparedness in Disasters, 
or RAPID, a group sponsored by performer Norman Wisdom. They are helping 
Honduras dig out from the storm that killed some 10,000 people in 
Central America. About 60 of them are buried here in the district 
of Nueva Esperanza. The name is Spanish for New Hope, but there is 
none, not any more. Mitch dumped nearly 3 feet (a meter) of rain on 
the country, causing hillsides to slip away and swallowing up whole 
families and their houses. After two weeks, the chances that anyone 
is still alive are zero. But the digging doesn't stop. Relatives want 
to give family members a decent burial, or simply to have proof, rather 
than lingering doubts. Many come to thank the volunteers. It's small 
consolation. A large boulder blocks the way. Mike Holyhead of Forest 
of Dean works it loose with a portable winch, and the rock crashes 
down the hillside to the muddy waters of the Choluteca River far below. 
The have no heavy equipment. What the diggers give up in power, they 
gain in mobility _ everything can be hand-carried and loaded at a 
moment's notice. The smell gets stronger, and the men pull on surgical 
masks. When the spade turns up a nest of maggots, they go slow. It 
seems they're getting close. They found one baby a day earlier, then 
the body of the mother. Team leader Sessions has been at this for 
years _ more than he cares to say. From Peru to Iran to Japan, he's 
been there and done that. But he never has seen anything like Mitch. 
No one has. ``It's so big, you don't know where to start,'' he said. 
``You go by smell. And you don't need a dog.'' The digging takes them 
perilously under an shelf of rock and loose dirt, but they keep going. 
Snakes, spiders and scorpions are a constant hazard. A Honduran policeman 
shouts that boulders may be loose up above, and he gives the drill. 
``If you hear a whistle, jump, um ... that way,'' he says, pointing. 
The plan sounds precarious at best. For all the danger and lack of 
pay, the personal rewards here are small. ``We take unnecessary risks 
to reach people,'' said Sessions, a Devon native. ``But when you find 
someone alive, when you've scored one, that makes it all worthwhile. 
``Here, there's no one alive. And when you find a child's body, it 
tears you to pieces.'' He breaks off, his eyes moist. They don't find 
one today. The spades dig through the area the suspect area and hit 
rock. The contamination was from another body, perhaps the mother. 
The search goes on. ``We're just ordinary blokes doing ordinary jobs,'' 
says Sessions. ``People allow as you're more than you are, but you're 
just doing a job that needs to be done. And when you can't find them, 
you just feel useless.'' Paul Minshull, 23, of Devon is a newcomer 
to RAPID. After two years in training, this is his first oversees 
assignment. He likens his job to a calling. ``If you asked me why 
I do it, I couldn't explain,'' he said. ``I just know it feels right.''
