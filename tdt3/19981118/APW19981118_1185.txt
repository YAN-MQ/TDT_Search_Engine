Father Frost, Russia's version of Santa Claus, will now have a place 
to hang his red coat. The northern Russian town of Veliky Ustyug is 
building a house for Father Frost _ his first _ where children will 
be able to track him down for requests, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported Wednesday. Local officials and a timber company in Veliky 
Ustyug formed a joint company Wednesday that will build a house for 
the bearded gift-bearer and help handle his correspondence. The home 
should be ready to receive visitors later this year, in time for the 
New Year's holiday, when Father Frost, or Dyed Moroz, brings gifts 
to Russian children. The idea to put the house in Veliky Ustyug, 800 
kilometers (500 miles) northeast of Moscow on the Sukhona River, was 
first floated by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, ITAR-Tass said.
