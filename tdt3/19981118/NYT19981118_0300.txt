Just in case the sexy beats and rowdy antics didn't get every last 
person in Wetlands dancing on Sunday night, Digital Underground had 
plenty of gimmicks. The veteran hip-hop group's comic and musical 
mastermind, Shock G, and his mates tossed out ``party packs'' _ sandwich 
bags full of potato chips, breath mints, noisemakers and condoms _ 
during the anthem to earthly pleasure, ``Doowutchyalike.'' Then members 
showered everyone with Silly String and movie-theater popcorn. Free 
beer was offered from a cooler onstage. It was chaos as usual for 
this crew. In the early 1990s, Digital Underground declared itself 
the hip-hop progeny of funk legend George Clinton and his P-Funk collective 
and set out to inspire the scene with earthy wisdom and mind-altering 
joy. The group followed up this lofty claim with a series of inspired 
hits, from ``The Humpty Dance'' to ``Kiss You Back,'' which this reconstituted 
assemblage performed on Sunday. Digital Underground also presented 
material from its new album, ``Who Got the Gravy?'' (Jake/Seagram); 
the new songs had their moments, although they didn't match their 
predecessors. The group's sound still draws heavily from P-Funk, augmented 
by other borrowings, both obvious (the Artist) and up-to-date (Lauryn 
Hill). Two turntablists replaced the original DJ Fuze. They never 
approached his artfulness, but Shock G, who also played a strap-on 
keyboard, still orchestrated a lively commotion. Two new rappers impressed, 
fortifying the interplay of Shock G and fellow group founder Money 
B: Esinchill did a witty deadpan turn on the gangsta pose, and Mystik 
added a no-nonsense female viewpoint. The group's shenanigans included 
some dirty dancing with female fans during the lascivious ``Freaks 
of the Industry,'' and the return of Humpty-Hump, Shock G's Jerry 
Lewis-esque alter ego. There was also a moment of appreciation for 
Tupac Shakur, who began his career as part of this Oakland-based group. 
Shock G turned mourning into deliverance by leading the crowd in a 
two-minute-long yowling session banishing all demons from the room. 
It seemed to work: throughout the show, good spirits prevailed.
