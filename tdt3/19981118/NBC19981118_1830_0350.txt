Still ahead, NBC news "in depth" -- Americans trying to improve their 
health. The latest trend, supplements, herbal pills and powders. But, 
do they live up to their hype? We expect them to have good scientific 
evidence to back up their claim. Big business, big promises and a 
government warning tonight. What is the whole truth? And U.N. inspectors 
back on the Hunt. But did Saddam Hussein find new hiding places for 
his weapons of mass destruction? The truck is here. Introducing the 
new Silverado... it's bigger. It's more powerful. It's the truck from 
Chevrolet. Like a rock oh, like a rock.
