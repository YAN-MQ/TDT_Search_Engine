Japan will back a planned International Monetary Fund bailout for 
Pakistan, which had been stalled to protest Pakistan's nuclear tests 
in May, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Foreign Minister Masahiko 
Komura told visiting Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz of Tokyo's 
decision on the planned dlrs 5 billion IMF bailout package when they 
met Wednesday, but he said Japan will continue to withhold its own 
assistance to Pakistan, a ministry official said. Aziz, who arrived 
Tuesday for a four-day visit, told Komura that Pakistan will sign 
the treaty banning nuclear tests by next September. Komura said Japan 
would consider resuming aid if Pakistan makes good on its promise, 
the official said, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity. 
It was unclear when a decision on the IMF funding to Pakistan would 
be made. Washington has decided to lift most of the sanctions that 
were imposed against Pakistan and India for the tests, and also will 
back the IMF bailout. India, which is not seeking IMF funds, has refused 
to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It says the treaty allows 
declared nuclear powers to build and test nuclear weapons while denying 
the opportunity to other nations that want to do so. Japan, the only 
nation ever to suffer nuclear attack, was outraged when India and 
Pakistan carried out nuclear tests earlier this year.
