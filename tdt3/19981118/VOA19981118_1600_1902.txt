Republicans in the House of Representatives have chosen a new leadership 
team, after disappointing results in the congressional elections. 
The republicans, meeting in closed session, picked Representative, 
Bob Livingston of Louisiana to replace the controversial Newt Gingrich 
as Speaker of the House. Speaker designate, Livingston, outlined the 
goals of the republican majority. Things like making sure that social 
security is sound for the people intending to retire in the coming 
years or people who already on retirement now. Making sure that our 
schools are adequately maintained so that youngsters are not forced 
to go to crime-ridden, drug-infested, inferior schools with inferior 
teachers. We want local accountability of schools. Making sure that 
everyone has access and choice of adequate health care facilities, 
physicians and doctors. Bob Livingston will succeed Newt Gingrich 
as Speaker of the House. Majority leader, Dick Army of Texas, survived 
strong challenges to hold on to his spot as the second-ranking republicans 
in the House. And J.C. Watts, a former college football quarterback, 
defeated incumbent, John Wolmer of Ohio for the job of Republican 
Conference Chairman. Mr. Watts has been a rising star in the party 
since his first election to Congress in 1994.
