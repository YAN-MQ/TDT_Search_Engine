Blazes of red and white have streaked across the skies of Asia in 
what is described as the biggest meteor storm in decades. From Thailand 
to Tokyo, Asians turn their eyes skyward to witness the climax of 
the Leonid meteor shower. U.S. space agency, NASA sent up research 
planes to study this phenomenon. The space storm was caused by comets, 
Tipple Tuttle's annual pass through the solar system. Every 33 years 
the comet offers a spectacular show as it passes close to earth. Thousands, 
perhaps tens of thousands of particles, some no larger than a grain 
of sand, burn up after hitting the earth's atmosphere. The storm was 
a cause of concern for Intelsat and other satellite manufacturers. 
Operators of the 600 satellites currently orbiting the earth maneuvered 
their crafts Monday to reduce damage during the 10 hour storm. So 
far, no disruptions in telecommunications are reported as had been 
feared.
