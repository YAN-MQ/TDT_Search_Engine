NEW YORK _ ``Flavorless marshmallow of a musical.'' ``Sickening.'' 
``A dispiritingly bland and juvenile spectacle.'' Such were some of 
the reviews that producers awakened to the morning after the musical 
``Footloose'' opened in October. But they did not crawl under a rock 
and hide or contemplate new careers. Michael David of Dodger Endemol 
Theatricals, which produced ``Footloose,'' said that such reviews, 
while painful, no longer cut as deeply as they once did, largely because 
he and his colleagues have developed ways to succeed in spite of them. 
The strategies are all part of a newly invigorated, bulked-up form 
of marketing on Broadway that takes credit for providing life support 
to more than one critically pummeled show. ``It has never made a lot 
of sense to us to spend our short lives and the amount of sweat equity 
and money involved investing in things we then empower someone else 
to make breathe or not,'' David said. ``As much as the critical community 
is one indicator of your success, there are so many others.'' To some 
extent, marketing has always been part of selling a show. The flamboyant 
producer David Merrick, for example, was known for his attention-getting 
gimmicks, like taking out full-page ads contesting critical reviews 
of his plays. But while marketing budgets have not greatly increased, 
remaining at about 10 percent of a production's potential weekly gross, 
promotion has come to play an increasingly important role on Broadway. 
Several theatrical producers and the artistic director Gregory Mosher 
are involving themselves in marketing. Independent companies have 
sprung up to develop promotional maneuvers like advertising on Food 
Emporium shopping bags in exchange for tickets for management. Among 
other recent examples: _ Such offers as buy one ticket to ``Jekyll 
and Hyde'' and get a free round-trip bus fare on New Jersey Transit. 
_ Seeking a three-minute spot on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show.'' _ Advertising 
on airport luggage carts and subway clocks. _ Spreading leaflets at 
a Baptist ministers' conference in Harlem. ``You used to have the 
general manager and the press agent,'' said Jed Bernstein, executive 
director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade 
group for Broadway productions. ``Now virtually every production has 
a marketing consultant as part of the team.'' This is a big change 
from theater publicity of yore, which largely consisted of playing 
up good reviews and praying to weather bad ones. Now producers are 
increasingly trying to proceed without the critics altogether. Indeed, 
they spend a lot of their time and energy cultivating audiences that 
don't pay attention to reviews. The tools of choice: advertising, 
media attention and promotions. ``We have a lot of ways to reach these 
people now,'' said Nancy Coyne of the theatrical ad agency Serino 
Coyne Inc., which is marketing ``Footloose'' in part with ads on MTV 
and VH-1 featuring dancing feet. ``It's been so long since I based 
a campaign on critical response.'' With many kinds of entertainment 
competing for consumer attention and corporate newcomers to Broadway 
like Disney and Livent upping the ante with attention-getting marketing, 
marketing has become a matter of Broadway's survival. ``Ten years 
ago, an ad meeting consisted of an ad agent and a press agent,'' said 
Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization. 
``Last week at an ad meeting for `Peter Pan,' there were 13 people 
in the room. We're an industry that really in the last five years 
has woken up to what marketing means.'' Not everyone is enthusiastic 
about phenomena like Disney's shop at the New Amsterdam Theater filled 
with ``Lion King'' merchandise. Veteran Broadway producer Alexander 
H. Cohen, for example, said he has held fast to a policy of selling 
no merchandise for his shows, not even a poster. ``I don't believe 
in that; I find it common,'' he said. ``But I'm terribly old fashioned 
in that regard. No coffee cups, no T-shirts.'' Cohen went on to say, 
however, that other kinds of marketing were appropriate and important. 
Sure enough, producers who once shied away from market research now 
unabashedly study their audiences through frequent focus groups and 
surveys; George Wachtel, president of Audience Research and Analysis, 
a performing-arts market-research concern, said his business had mushroomed 
since he started it three years ago. Theaters are pitching their shows 
to specific age groups, ethnic groups or ZIP codes by visiting neighborhood 
institutions and using direct mail, often buying subscription lists 
from theaters like the Manhattan Theater Club and the Roundabout Theater 
Company, which can be expensive. A mailing of 100,000 can run about 
$45,000. Of necessity, off-Broadway theaters have led the pack in 
finding new ways to target audiences because they cannot afford expensive 
advertising nor the wait for reviews. With more people seeking a piece 
of this new promotion pie, the worlds of marketing and theater are 
drawing on each other's expertise. The producers of hip shows like 
``Rent'' and ``Chicago'' turned to Spotco, which specializes in graphics 
for record albums and movies, to give their productions an up-to-the-minute 
look. Bernstein spent 16 years in advertising before becoming head 
of the league three years ago. Since then it has developed such marketing 
deals as a Broadway Visa card and making Continental Airlines the 
``official'' airline of Broadway. Nancy Richards left producing two 
years ago to start her marketing company, the Richards Group. Similarly, 
Randall L. Wreghitt, one of the producers of ``The Beauty Queen of 
Leenane,'' recently started his own promotions company, Promarketing. 
And in October, Gregory Mosher, the former artistic director of Lincoln 
Center Theater and the Goodman Theater in Chicago, joined the theatrical 
advertising agency LeDonne, Wilner &AMP; Weiner as a consultant. Mosher, 
who continues to produce and direct, said it was his success luring 
young people and Latinos as one of the producers of ``Freak,'' John 
Leguizamo's one-man show, which moved to Broadway, that made him realize 
there were important ways of reaching new audiences. The efforts, 
which included a minimum ticket price of $17.50, paid off. Mosher 
said 75 percent of the audience at ``Freak'' was under 35, and 55 
percent had never seen a Broadway show. Given the traditional mode 
of marketing, which he described as trying ``to massage reviews into 
as much audience as you can,'' Mosher said he was eager to help producers 
like himself come up with new methods. Rethinking the splashy campaign 
for ``Ragtime'' was one of his first assignments. Although some shows 
have run despite poor reviews, last season such survivors were particularly 
abundant, and theater veterans say it was in large part because of 
effective marketing. Sure enough, last week, ``Footloose'' grossed 
$559,000, up $83,000 from the week before, and was playing at 91 percent 
capacity with no tickets at the half-price booth. ``Twenty years ago 
that wouldn't have happened,'' said longtime Broadway producer James 
M. Nederlander. ``They would have closed on Saturday night.'' It isn't 
that audiences can be snowed by glitzy advertising or promotional 
gimmicks, producers say, it's that people like different shows for 
different reasons. For instance, some people just want to take the 
children to a theatrical spectacle or tap their feet and have a good 
time. ``Critics have become increasingly less representative of the 
people who are buying the tickets,'' Ms. Coyne said. ``As that has 
happened, marketing has become more important.'' For proof, producers 
say, just stroll down Broadway and look at the marquees. Critics called 
``Jekyll and Hyde'' ``a pseudo-serious potboiler'' and a ``plastic 
monster assembly kit of a musical.'' ``The Sound of Music'' was labeled 
``uninspired'' and ``the same old cup of treacle.'' ``Titanic'': ``Sinks 
like a stone.'' Yet all these shows are still running and ``Titanic'' 
won five Tonys. To market ``Jekyll and Hyde,'' Ms. Coyne said, her 
ad campaign emphasized gothic romance. ``It's a bodice ripper,'' she 
said. Thus the advertising line: ``This is the man one woman loves 
and the monster one woman fears. This is the musical that grabs Broadway 
by the throat.'' (By contrast, the critic John Simon observed in New 
York magazine that not even when Hyde and his paramour embrace ``is 
there anything to incur so much as an R rating.'') One could be forgiven 
for losing track of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel's'' marketing incarnations. 
That, in the view of Cablevision, which recently bought the show and 
revised it, was a big part of why it almost closed last spring. Frank 
Pellegrino, who heads the theater division at Grey Advertising and 
worked on ``Pimpernel,'' said he tried various concepts _ from intrigue 
(who is the Scarlet Pimpernel?) to romance (come fall for the Scarlet 
Pimpernel) to swashbuckling (ah, the adventure!) The latest campaign 
seems like a quirky combination of the three: ``Blackmail. Murder. 
Seduction. Bring Your Mother!'' The cost of such marketing varies 
considerably. Producing a television ad, for example, can run from 
$3,500 for flashing a few quotations or audience testimonials to $35,000 
for featuring a musical number from the show. The average Broadway 
musical allots $300,000 to $1 million for preopening publicity and 
spends $50,000 to $75,000 a week on marketing, ad executives say. 
Straight plays allot $20,000 to $35,000 a week and off-Broadway shows 
$5,000 to $20,000 a week. As the cost of producing plays has increased, 
advertisers say, so has the expense of marketing, particularly when 
producers have to sustain a show's substantial losses while spending 
a lot to save it. After opening to mixed reviews in 1996, the musical 
``State Fair'' spent $475,000 in one month on top of its $165,000 
weekly advertising budget to try to find an audience. It failed. Shrewd 
marketing can give even acclaimed shows a lift, creating the buzz 
all producers crave. ``There are shows you design from the beginning 
to not be about the critics,'' said Drew Hodges, the creative director 
of Spotco. ``If you do more publicity early on, you can get an idea 
in a person's mind before the critic puts an idea in a person's mind.'' 
Despite the success of many marketing efforts, some shows can't be 
salvaged, sometimes even with good reviews. Many point to ``Side Show,'' 
last season's critically praised musical about Siamese twins, which 
quickly closed; audiences found the subject matter a turnoff. And 
then there are reviews for plays like this season's ``More to Love: 
A Big Fat Comedy'' featuring the stand-up comedian Rob Bartlett, which 
make early death seem all but inevitable. ``A big fat mess,'' said 
one critic. ``Suggests a variation on those light-bulb jokes `How 
many producers does it take to convince an audience that a good stand-up 
show is really a play?''' said another. The producers did not even 
attempt a rescue and pulled the plug two days after the play opened. 
``There are times when it's too grim,'' said Pellegrino of Grey Advertising, 
who did not work on the Bartlett play. ``And you bite the bullet and 
tell the client, `The best thing you can do is close the show.'''
