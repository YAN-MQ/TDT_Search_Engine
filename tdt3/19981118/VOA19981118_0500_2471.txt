United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, says children bearing the 
brunt of the devastation left by Hurricane Mitch in Central America 
and they will suffer from its effects for months and years to come. 
Lisa Schline reports from Geneva. UNICEF studied specifically the 
situation in Honduras. The study found that about one-half of the 
estimated 7,000 people killed by Hurricane Mitch in Honduras are believed 
to have been children. It says children also comprise at least one-half 
of the 10,000 Hondurans who are still missing and the nearly 2 million 
made homeless. UNICEF communication officer, Patrick McCormick, says 
children who live in shelters are particularly vulnerable to disease. 
Furthermore, he says the lack of proper sanitation and safe drinking 
water could lead to water borne diseases. We are seeing an increased 
number of instance of respiratory infections, diarrhea, and we foresee 
outbreaks, unless we are very, very lucky of Malaria, Cholera, and 
such things like that, and of course, the hepatitis. These will hit 
children first. The study was conducted with the Honduran government. 
It says the country was making considerable progress in reducing child 
mortality before the disaster struck. The child death rate had dropped 
and it looked as though it would continue to drop. But UNICEF says 
Hurricane Mitch will slow perhaps even reverse, this progress. Mr. 
McCormick says the psychological impact on children from this tragedy 
is devastating. We can't even begin to imagine how many children have 
been traumatized by their own experiences in seeing family members, 
mothers, fathers, dragged away by mother water. We have noticed already 
some signs of depression. Mr. McCormick says many children are having 
difficulty sleeping and eating. Some are prone to violent behavior 
and are having learning difficulties. UNICEF says its greatest needs 
are for food, medicine, water, and helicopters to ferry relief supplies 
to inaccessible, remote areas of the country. The agency says it also 
hopes to provide psychological counseling for traumatized children 
and once the emergency situation settles down, UNICEF says it will 
begin a tracing service to try to locate missing family members. Lisa
