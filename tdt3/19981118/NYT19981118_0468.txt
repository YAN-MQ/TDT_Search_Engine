Only a few U.S. soldiers actually landed here before President Clinton 
called off air strikes against Iraq last weekend. Most of them are 
going home soon. But the camp itself, the main funnel for Army troops 
into Kuwait, stands as evidence that military planners expect their 
return, or at least a long U.S. presence, in the Persian Gulf. There 
is a movie theater here, with free popcorn, that runs all day. There 
are 2,000 bicycles, six personal self-propelled watercraft, two boats, 
sailing lessons and 85 sets of scuba gear, as well as a growing number 
of private or semiprivate rooms with television sets, videocassette 
recorders and microwave ovens. Soldiers can eat free hot dogs and 
hamburgers at Uncle Frosty's Desert Oasis. On Wednesday, workers busily 
spackled the joints of new walls and set up ventilation ducts in a 
new section of a gymnasium that is already huge, with dozens of treadmills, 
Stairmasters and Nautilus machines, a basketball court and an aerobics 
room, not to mention the big television set that blares MTV. ``I believe 
they are going to put in a sauna,'' a spokeswoman for the Army, Capt. 
Tamara Parker, said as a group of visiting British soldiers gawked 
at the distinctly American scale of the gym. What all the amenities 
boil down to is making a larger number of troops comfortable for a 
longer period of time. The complex, Camp Doha, was founded in the 
gulf war in 1991. It has slowly expanded into a permanent and extremely 
well-stocked post for 800 or 900 soldiers. ``It is certainly an ongoing 
United States commitment to assure our neighbors here in the Middle 
East of our long-term commitment to this region,'' the head officer, 
Lt. Col. Sean Finnegan, said Wednesday. ``We are also here as part 
of deterrence.'' Apart from the frills the camp, on the gulf outside 
of Kuwait City, has a major military objective. The Army keeps on 
standby enough tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, artillery, medical 
helicopters and other gear to outfit 5,200 soldiers. The theory is 
that troops can arrive here, receive their equipment and be armed 
and in the field in less than a day. That is exactly what happened 
in February, in the last U.S. confrontation with Iraq. In more peaceful 
times up to 1,500 soldiers rotate through Doha to a desert firing 
range 30 miles from the Iraqi border for three months of training, 
partly with the Kuwaiti military. In addition to keeping a force in 
the region the training also keeps the equipment ready for battle. 
If the accommodations seems deluxe, military officials say, it is 
to make up for the higher potential for danger. The soldiers seem 
blase about their surroundings. Specialist Kasson Carter, 23, of Charleston, 
S.C., who was watching friends play video games in Uncle Frosty's, 
said Doha reminded him of another posting where the United States 
has had to keep its soldiers for a long time. ``It's OK, but I'm used 
it,'' he said. ``I've been in Korea, where they have as much as here.''
