House Republicans have endorsed Louisiana Representative, Bob Livingston 
to be the new Speaker of the House. He'll replace Newt Gingrich in 
the new Congress. Majority leader Dick Armey will hold on to his position, 
after turning back challenges from Steve Largent, of Oklahoma, and 
Jennifer Dunn of Washington. Armey'' fellow Texan, Tom DeLay will 
return as Majority Whip. Oklahoma Representative J. C. Watts will 
take over as Chairman of the Republican Conference. Watts, the only 
African American in the Republican caucus, scored a surprise victory 
when he won endorsement to the number four-leadership position.
