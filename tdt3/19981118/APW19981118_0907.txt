Greece on Wednesday told Turkey it had nothing to do with a Kurdish 
rebel leader held in Italy, and called on its neighbor to solve its 
domestic problems instead of issuing threats of war. ``I repeat, Greece 
has no involvement in this issue,'' said government spokesman Yannis 
Nikolaou. ``Turkey must find a way to solve its internal problems 
and not consider them an item for export or the blame of others.'' 
Abdullah Ocalan, whose outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has 
waged a 14-year guerrilla war in Turkey, was arrested last week in 
Rome, where he is now seeking political asylum. Turkey, pressing for 
the extradition of its most wanted man, Tuesday accused Greece and 
Cyprus of ``playing with fire'' by harboring Ocalan's allies. ``We 
see their relations with the PKK, which has designs on Turkey's territorial 
integrity, as very dangerous and which could have irreparable repercussions 
'' for Greeks and Greek Cypriots, the Turkish foreign ministry said. 
During a visit to Turkey last month, Premier Costas Simitis personally 
reassured his Turkish counterpart that Greece had no ties with the 
PKK. The latest charges were angrily denied here. ``Ankara is in a 
total state of confusion,'' the foreign ministry said. Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yannos Kranidiotis also berated Turkey's ambassador here 
during a Wednesday meeting. Greece has appeared keen to stay out of 
the Ocalan affair, despite growing domestic pressure. Earlier this 
month, 109 deputies from the 300-member parliament signed an open 
invitation for Ocalan to visit. Local media and politicians have called 
for Greece's active opposition to Ocalan's extradition to Turkey, 
where he could face the death penalty. ``It seems the Turkish side 
fails to understand that in Greece citizens, let alone members of 
parliament, have absolute freedom to express their opinion,'' the 
foreign ministry said. But Ocalan on Wednesday also tried to drag 
Greece into the fray, likening the plight of the Kurds to that of 
Greeks in Asia Minor and Cyprus. ``(Turkey's) objective is to clear 
Kurds out of southeast Turkey just as they did to Armenians, Assyrians 
and Greeks,'' he said in an interview with Italy's La Repubblica newspaper. 
``They have the same designs in Cyprus.'' He was referring to Turkey's 
1974 invasion and occupation of northern Cyprus, following an abortive 
Athens-backed coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union with Greece.
