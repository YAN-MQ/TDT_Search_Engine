Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader wanted by Turkey 
has soured relations between the normally close allies, and as government 
leaders in Rome and Ankara traded angry words Wednesday, the United 
States added to the pressure by also calling for extradition of the 
Kurd, Abdullah Ocalan. ``We believe he should be extradited and brought 
to justice,'' the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said in 
Washington Wednesday. ``And we hope a way will be found to extradite 
him to Turkey, consistent with international and Italian law.'' Prime 
Minister Massimo D'Alema has been in a quandary over what to do with 
Ocalan, leader of the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party, since he 
was arrested last week trying to enter Italy. Italian law forbids 
the extradition of prisoners to countries that have a death penalty. 
But D'Alema, a former Communist, is also under pressure from leftists 
in his coalition to grant Ocalan political asylum. He has not ruled 
it out, saying instead that if Ocalan's pledges to renounce terrorism 
are sincere, Italy will consider his case. Turkey views Ocalan as 
a terrorist. Wednesday, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told the Turkish 
Parliament that if Italy fails to extradite Ocalan, ``not only will 
it remain as a stain on their record but they will become accomplices 
to every murder ever committed'' by the Kurdistan Workers Party. Yilmaz 
added, ``No government of the Turkish republic would ever forget this.'' 
Wednesday night D'Alema sternly rebutted Yilmaz. Calling the comment 
on Italy ``unacceptable,'' D'Alema said: ``Italy does not justify 
terrorism and will not be an accomplice to it. Those who dare to make 
this link are wrong.'' Ocalan, who is being held in an undisclosed 
hospital near Rome, was adding his own form of pressure. ``We have 
abandoned terrorism and are ready for a peace accord,'' he wrote to 
the daily newspaper La Repubblica in answer to the newspaper's written 
questions. ``My presence here testifies to a change in the strategy 
of the Kurdish national movement.'' Angry demonstrations for and against 
Ocalan have spread across Europe. A 30-year-old Kurd set himself on 
fire Wednesday in Rome. In Moscow on Tuesday, two supporters of the 
rebel leader set themselves on fire; one died. The other protester 
in Moscow and the man in Rome were hospitalized. Kurdish demonstrators 
in Turkey also set themselves on fire this week. Passions also run 
high on the other side. In Brussels, Turkish demonstrators set fire 
to two houses in a neighborhood with many Kurdish residents. Italian 
television Wednesday night showed Turkish demonstrators in Istanbul 
holding rallies, burning Kurdish flags and calling for a boycott of 
Italian goods, including Versace and Armani designer clothes. Italy, 
which exported $3.14 billion worth of goods to Turkey in the first 
nine months of this year, could ill afford such a boycott. Any hope 
the Italian government harbored that Germany would take Ocalan off 
its hands, moreover, has dimmed. Germany, which issued a warrant for 
Ocalan's arrest on homicide charges in 1990, has not requested his 
extradition, which Italy could more easily grant because Germany has 
no death penalty. But Germany has a huge Turkish population and a 
strong Kurdish one, and is apparently reluctant to make a move that 
would inevitably generate fresh tensions. Wednesday night D'Alema 
hinted that he felt isolated and would welcome some support from his 
European colleagues. ``This is not about Italy and Turkey,'' the prime 
minister said. ``It involves all of Europe, from which we expect total 
solidarity. We've already gotten signs of encouragement, and we are 
expecting more tangible political gestures.''
