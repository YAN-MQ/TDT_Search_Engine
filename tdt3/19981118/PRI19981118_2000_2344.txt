Hear that sound? Lots of folks will, all over the world in the next 
24 hours, because, no it is not a ping pong match. It's Beaudelai 
day tomorrow. In facts the corks are already popping at the sight 
of today's Geography quiz. French wine lovers around the globe are 
all a-buzz about the traditional release of the latest harvest of 
Beaudelai Neuveu. This year's Beaudelai goes on sale seconds after 
the clock strikes midnight in one time zone after the other. The time 
honored ritual of the annual cork popping ritual occurs on the third 
Thursday of November. And being in one of the closest zones to the 
international date line, our mystery spot will be one of the first 
to toast the 1998 vintage. A few more clues, now. This spot rests 
about 1200 miles east of Australia, and it consists of two major islands. 
So, where will the corks be a-popping first, you'll hear it through 
the grapevine, in just a few minutes.
