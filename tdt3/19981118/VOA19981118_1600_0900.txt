How well Iraq plans to cooperate remains to be seen. A spokesman for 
the Ministry of Culture and Information in Iraq, has denounced what 
it calls American and British efforts to overthrow the Iraqi government. 
He said U.S. officials have openly discussed details of ways to oust 
President, Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, Britain plans to host a meeting 
of Iraqi opposition groups Monday to encourage them to work together 
for democracy in Iraq. British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, told the 
New York Times newspaper there is growing opposition to President 
Saddam inside Iraq.
