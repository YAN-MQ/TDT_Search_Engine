Let's take a look at the Thursday morning newspaper headlines. We 
begin in Miami. Fears among U.S. officials that north Korea is building 
an underground nuclear plant. This is a hot topic, as the president 
prepares to visit south Korea this weekend. "Dallas morning news," 
after midnight on Thursday, the first piece of the international space 
station goes up. If that goes well, the space shuttle endeavor December 
3 takes up what will be the second piece of the sprawling space station. 
Eventually you'll be able to stand in your back yard and watch it 
go over. "Denver post," air force report calls crash suicide. Remember 
in April 1997 the story that received so much coverage? The captain, 
it has been ruled a suicide distraught over a lost love. In "USA today," 
happy birthday times seven. The first birthday for the seven children. 
They're going on "Oprah." They're about to move into a new home built 
by donors to replace their go-bedroom home. Finally tonight a quick 
look at how things will proceed tomorrow on the hill. Our coverage 
on MSNBC will begin live at 9:00 A.M. NBC news Tom Brokaw will join 
us at 10:00 A.M. a complete review and summary tomorrow evening. Before 
we go here tonight, a reminder, coming up immediately following this 
prod dast, an MSNBC special report on the impeachment debate. Anchored 
by John Hockenberry, who, along with tonight's guess, will presue 
what begins in hours here on the hill. And that is our broadcast for 
this Wednesday night. We hope to see you from Washington at this same 
time tomorrow night throughout the day during our coverage tomorrow. 
I'm Brian Williams. For all of us here, good night, everybody. From 
the independent counsel's office. Did she not? And we are in the process 
of litigating those statements. How many did she find there was prima 
facie reason to believe that your office had committed these leaks?
