Is that Johnson's team behind us? Exactly. Are they members of hertz 
#1 club gold? exactly. Are we members of hertz #1...? Not, not... 
not exactly. So thanks to hertz, they're going to get to the meeting 
on time. And we'll be late. So exactly what'll I tell the boss, hmm? 
In rent-A-car, there's hertz and there's "not exactly." Make sure 
you choose the right one. And then a dog in the cargo hold ate our 
presentation. Is he buying it? Not exactly. They clean them. They 
Polish them. They lavish them with extras. Maybe the reason Dodge 
ram owners take such good care of their trucks is that their trucks... 
take such good care of them. And now, ram is J.D. power and associates 
"most appealing full-size pickup" for the fourth consecutive year. 
The rules have changed.
