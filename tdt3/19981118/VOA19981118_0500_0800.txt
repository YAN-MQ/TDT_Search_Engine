United States and European envoys are pushing Yugoslav and ethnic 
Albanian leaders toward a mutually acceptable peace agreement and 
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. The U.S. envoy has presented a peace 
agreement to ethnic Albanian leaders. Meanwhile the chief international 
observer in Kosovo has met with Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. 
VOA's Chalice McDonna has details. The State Department says the Director 
of the International Team of Observers in Kosovo met with Yugoslav 
president, Slobodan Milosevic, for 90 minutes on Monday. Spokesman, 
James Rubin, says ambassador, William Walker, talked to the Yugoslav 
leader about several cases of Serbian noncompliance with the Kosovo 
agreements. He told President Milosevic that the verification mission 
will not allow itself to be intimidated by either side. In particular, 
he talked about an incident, in which the Serb forces apparently fired 
on, in the direction of a monitor's vehicle, declaring this unacceptable. 
Although Milosevic insists that these were backfires from some car, 
we do not believe that was the case. Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy, 
Christopher Hill was in Kosovo meeting with representatives from the 
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. He met with KLA representatives 
to discuss the security situation and he urged, as we have from Washington, 
the Kosovo Liberation Army to exercise restraint and reduce their 
aggressive presence on the highways. Mr. Rubin says the cease-fire 
in Kosovo is holding, although he expects problems to continue until 
the underlying political problem between the Serbs and the ethnic 
Albanians is resolved. He says the Untied States has proposed a three-year 
trial period of autonomy for Kosovo. Deferring the question of the 
province's permanent status until later. KLA representatives have 
said they will respond to the U.S. proposal within 10 days. Chalice
