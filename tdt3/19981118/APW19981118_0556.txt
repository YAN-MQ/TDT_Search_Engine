The Philippines will begin negotiations with the Japanese government 
next week on projects for which it hopes to obtain funding from the 
Miyazawa fund, a dlrs 30 billion credit line for troubled Asian countries. 
Estrada said he will place special emphasis on agricultural and low-cost 
housing projects in seeking financing from the fund. ``These are the 
priority projects,'' he told reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation summit. Estrada said a dlrs 10 billion aid package unveiled 
by the United States and Japan at the summit, coupled with the Miyazawa 
fund and rescue packages led by the International Monetary Fund, were 
positive developments in combating the economic turmoil that has engulfed 
the Asia region over the past 16 months. He said significant progress 
was made at the APEC summit in advancing the Manila Framework, an 
agreement reached last November in Manila to forge a cooperative effort 
to combat the crisis and prevent future ones. APEC, he said, had been 
``strengthened'' by the willingness of Japan and the United States 
to provide more financing to help countries grappling with the crisis. 
Estrada said a Japanese delegation will soon visit the southern Philippine 
province of Mindanao to discuss development aid. Parts of the region 
rank among the Philippines' poorest areas and have been earmarked 
by Japan and other donor countries for special attention for development 
financing. Estrada rejected a suggestion that APEC was being fractured 
by a political spat caused by U.S. Vice President Al Gore's expression 
of support for Malaysia's reform movement. Meanwhile, Finance Secretary 
Edgardo Espiritu reiterated that the Philippines has no intention 
of implementing currency controls, but suggested that Malaysia's restrictions 
on the convertibility of its currency, the ringgit, may have been 
the right solution for that country's particular problems. ``But it's 
not an option being considered by the Philippines,'' he said. Espiritu 
said the call by APEC leaders in their joint statement for a review 
of the practices of international credit rating agencies was an issue 
that would be taken up by the group's finance ministers.
