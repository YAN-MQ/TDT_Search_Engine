One day after the Israeli Parliament approved the new interim agreement 
with the Palestinians, Israeli police have moved a group of Jewish 
settlers from hilltops in the West Bank. Lise Dusette reports. Dozens 
of Jewish settlers traveled in the dark of night to take over a few 
hilltops several kilometers west of their settlement at Kedue Mein 
in the north of the West Bank. The Settlers insisted, their action 
was officially sanctioned by Israel's foreign minister, Ariel Sharron, 
who had called on Jewish settlers to seize as many hilltops as they 
could before the land was handed to Palestinian control. But Israeli 
police evacuated the settlers around Kedue Mein saying the land they 
occupied lay outside the boundaries of their settlement. Despite stiff 
opposition, the government is expected to start its next pull back 
later this week. Lise Dusette, in Jerusalem.
