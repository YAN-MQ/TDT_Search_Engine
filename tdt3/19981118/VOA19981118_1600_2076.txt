United States says the North Korean government has offered to allow 
a senior U.S. envoy access to a suspected underground nuclear weapons 
facility. But only in exchange for compensation. VOA's Nick Symion 
reports from the State Department. Two days of talks between senior 
U.S. envoy Charles Cartman and foreign ministry officials in Peong 
Yang failed to clear up American suspicions that the secretive north 
may be making nuclear weapons at the underground site in violation 
of a 1994 agreement. At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin, 
told reporters the north as it has done on previous occasions demanded 
foreign aid in exchange for letting the American delegation visit 
the site, a demand the U.S. side rejected. What is important is that 
we get the kind of on-site access that we think we need to assure 
ourselves that there is no activity that would affect the viability 
of the agreement. In that agreement, North Korea promised to freeze 
development of nuclear weapons in exchange for help in building nuclear 
reactors for peaceful purposes. Peong Yang denies the underground 
complex in question is being used for anything but civilian purposes.
