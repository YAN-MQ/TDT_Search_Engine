Despite not winning a major tournament in 1998, American golf star, 
Tiger Woods has won his first round match at the PGA Grand Slam of 
Golf in Hawaii. Woods is the top seed at the 36-hole event, which 
will be determined by the match play format for the first time in 
its 19-year history. Tuesday, Woods defeated his four seeded countrymen 
and U.S. Open champion, Lee Jansen, 3 and 2. And Tiger said putting 
well made the difference. Today, I really rolled the rock well. I 
did not hit the ball as close as I would like to, but the putter was 
so hot, I really did not need it. I made a lot of puts from 15, 20 
feet, but overall, I am very happy the way I played enough to, it 
is a great start but an ideal start. Third seed, PGA Championship 
winner, V. J. Sing of Fiji, held off Masters and British Open Champion, 
Mark O'Mera of the United States with a two up victory. Woods will 
play Sing for the title today while Jansen and O'Mera will face off 
for third place.
