all eyes will be on iraq wednesday as u.n. weapons inspectors return 
to their posts. jane arraf reports, the inspectors will have their 
work cut out for them. unscom is back. the question on both sides 
is, "for how long?" inspectors evacuated last week amid threats of 
a u.s. attack returned after baghdad lifted its ban on weapons inspections. 
iraq promised to resume full cooperation in return for a review that 
it expects to eventually lead to a lifting of sanctions. but while 
security council members call for iraq to prove its intentions with 
sustained cooperation, an iraqi weapons expert tells cnn baghdad expects 
the review within weeks. why should the inspections take months? it's 
a question of establishing resumption of cooperation. and that could 
be done easily, within a short period of time. there are more potential 
flash points -- the last talks in baghdad with unscom chief richard 
butler floundered partly on a single document detailing all the bombs 
dropped on iran during the iran/iraq war. iraq says that had nothing 
to do with unscom's mandate and wouldn't give it up. unscom still 
wants the document. iraq still says it's not that simple. we are ready 
again to do that, to discuss this question. all relevant figures mentioned 
in that paper could be discussed easily, but all nonrelevant items, 
or details, nonrelevant to unscom's mandate and unscoms work, should 
be excluded because those constitute information which are sought 
after by intelligence. the real test of inspections won't come immediately. 
unscom is still assembling teams of experts to do the kind of detective 
work that iraq considers offensive and unnecessary. iraq says it's 
fully committed to cooperating, but only if the u.n. lives up to its 
side of the bargain. it says even with the continued threat of u.s. 
military attack, there are limits to its patience. jane arraf, cnn, 
baghdad.
