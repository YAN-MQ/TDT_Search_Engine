The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 19: People 
who hold views unpopular with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his administration 
routinely have to go to court to win the right to hold marches in 
New York City. This week a U.S. District Court judge struck down the 
city's parade permit law as unconstitutional. Judge Leonard Sand found 
that the law violated First Amendment rights because it sets no time 
limits on when the Police Department must act on a permit request. 
In reviewing more than 20 parade requests, the court found that some 
groups got a quick response. But others were made to wait for weeks 
or months before getting an answer. In the case before the court, 
the Million Marijuana March Organization sought a parade permit last 
January and was finally denied the request in April. The court was 
particularly disturbed by the delayed treatment of two requests to 
march against police brutality. The lack of a time frame creates the 
danger that delay could be used to censor speech. This is the third 
time in four months that federal judges have ruled against Giuliani 
for suppressing constitutionally protected protests. The mayor's impulse 
so far has been to lambaste the federal judges making the rulings. 
Now that the ordinance has been invalidated, he had better turn his 
energies toward creating a process that safeguards the free-speech 
rights of his critics.
