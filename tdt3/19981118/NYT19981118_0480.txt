When Nina Beck went into labor and frightening complications developed, 
her lesbian partner, Stacy Jolles, tried to go into the emergency 
room with her. But she was stopped at the door, she said, and asked, 
``Who are you? Do you have legal papers to be there?'' Ms. Beck's 
son, Noah, was born with a heart defect, and died last year at age 
2{. But, Ms. Jolles said Wednesday, ``Noah is very much here with 
us today. He would want us very much to be married, and he would want 
us to pursue this to the end.'' She spoke in the lobby of the Vermont 
Supreme Court on the day that Vermont became the central arena for 
the push for same-sex marriage in the United States. Hawaii seemed 
positioned to become the first state to legalize same-sex marriage 
after a 1993 state Supreme Court preliminary decision leaning in its 
favor; then an Alaska court case seemed to put that state next in 
line. But in this month's elections, Alaskan and Hawaiian voters rejected 
the idea in ballot initiatives. Now it is Vermont's turn. The state 
Supreme Court heard oral arguments Wednesday morning in Baker vs. 
State of Vermont, a lawsuit filed by Ms. Beck and Ms. Jolles, another 
lesbian couple and a gay male couple seeking the right to marry. The 
court is expected to rule within months. ``At least in the gay community, 
the eyes of the world are on Vermont right now,'' said Greg Johnson, 
a Vermont Law School professor who helped represent the gay couples 
in the Alaska case. The lesson of Alaska and Hawaii, Johnson said, 
was that work in the courts was not enough. ``The reason we have some 
hope here in Vermont is not just because the jurisprudence is good 
but the body politic is markedly different than in Alaska and Hawaii,'' 
he said. Vermont's legislature has passed extensive laws protecting 
gay men and lesbians from discrimination, and the state has been in 
the vanguard on recognizing ``second-parent adoptions'' _ allowing 
the member of a gay or lesbian couple who is not the biological parent 
of a child to officially become the second parent. But Vermont's Supreme 
Court has not been easily categorized as liberal or conservative. 
And the state, though known as home to a liberal, back-to-the-land 
contingent, also has a strong streak of traditionalism. So no one 
is making confident predictions about when, if ever, same-sex marriage 
will be allowed here. In questioning lawyers Wednesday, some of the 
justices seemed to challenge the ban on same-sex marriage more than 
the proposal to lift it. ``Why isn't that gender discrimination?'' 
Justice Denise Johnson asked. ``A man can't marry another man because 
he's a man.'' Another justice questioned the argument that marriage 
should be linked to procreation, noting that given recent advances 
in biology, it may eventually be possible for a homosexual couple 
to procreate. Arguing on behalf of the couples Wednesday, their lawyer, 
Beth Robinson, recalled the California Supreme Court's decision 50 
years ago to overturn the law against interracial marriage, and urged 
the court to emulate it. She compared the popular disapproval of interracial 
marriage then to attitudes toward same-sex marriage today. The California 
decision ``was controversial, it was courageous and it was correct,'' 
Ms. Robinson said. Speaking for the state of Vermont, which is defending 
a law that includes a definition of marriage as being between a man 
and a woman, Eve Jacobs-Carnahan argued that ``the state has an interest 
in supporting marriage and protecting it from potentially destabilizing 
changes.'' Asked by Ms. Johnson if the state saw marriage as a fundamental 
right, Ms. Jacobs-Carnahan responded, ``Yes, but it's a fundamental 
right between a man and a woman.'' The state, in its brief, also argues 
that such decisions concerning social policy should be left to the 
legislature and defends the state's interest in ``furthering the link 
between procreation and child rearing.'' Legal experts said the arguments 
on both sides did not differ significantly from those in Hawaii and 
Alaska. Dozens of spectators clustered in the Montpelier courthouse 
lobby, in what local officials said was the biggest hubbub at the 
court in recent memory. But there was not a hint of nastiness between 
partisans. Whichever way the court rules, though, both sides said, 
it is likely that the losing side will seek a state referendum to 
overturn the decision, and under Vermont's laws, the earliest such 
a referendum could be held would be 2002.
