A Kurdish man has set himself on fire in Rome in apparent protest 
against the jailing of Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan. Medics 
treated the man at the scene and took him to a hospital. His condition 
is not known. Mr. Ocalan was arrested last week at Rome airport. Turkey 
has requested his extradition for alleged terrorism and leading a 
guerrilla war for a Kurdish homeland in Turkey. Demonstrations and 
hunger strikes in support of Mr. Ocalan are being held throughout 
Europe.
