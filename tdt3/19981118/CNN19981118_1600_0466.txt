This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Thursday. Our blizzard-like conditions over North Dakota 
and Minnesota will move northeastward into sections of Ontario and 
Quebec, although snow will linger across the western Great Lakes. 
By Thursday evening, we'll see some rain and snow pushing into the 
northeast and some rain showers along a frontal boundary all the way 
down toward the gulf coast. There's a big storm off the coast in the 
northwest that will cause some wet and windy weather this weekend. 
Thursday's highs just in the 20s and 30s across the north-central 
U.S. it'll still be pretty mild in the southeast -- 60s, 70s and even 
some 80s. Looking ahead to Friday, look for rain and snow in the northeast 
and some heavy rain and wind developing in the northwest. On Saturday, 
the rain continues northwest. And Sunday, that is the area of focus 
with rain continuing right into sunday. Highs a little milder through 
the plains, some 60s, in fact. The coolest air will be across the 
northeast.
