The announcement of a financial aid package for Brazil has worked 
its magic on financial markets _ but many here now worry budget cuts 
required by the International Monetary Fund will fall disproportionately 
on the poor. Brazil's stock markets rallied 12 percent over three 
straight sessions following Friday's announcement of the long awaited 
dlrs 41.5 billion rescue package. The country's foreign reserves have 
stabilized since the beginning of November, after losing some dlrs 
30 billion since mid-August,. Foreign investment is postive for the 
first time in months and interest rates, hiked to near 50 percent 
a year at the height of the crisis, are coming down slowly. But all 
of this has come at a price. To qualify for the aid, the government 
announced plans to save 41.4 billion reals, (dlrs 34.8 billion) in 
1999 and 8.6 billion reals (dlrs 7.3 billion) of this are expected 
to come out of education, health and other public programs. ``The 
government cut some important assistance to the needy,'' said Senator 
Ramez Tebet of Mato Grosso do Sul state, who heads the budget committee. 
``We know we are living in a delicate time and that we have to make 
cuts but some of these cuts are worrisome.'' Tebet said the new budget 
called for sharp cuts to low-income housing subsidies, drought aid 
for the impoverished northeast and agrarian reform which seeks to 
distribute land to the landless. Brazil has one of the poorest land 
distributions in the world, with about 20 percent of the population 
holding 88 percent of the land, while the poorest 40 percent own just 
1 percent. ``What could spell problems is the cuts in land reform, 
where there were significant cuts and where the government faces a 
very organized opposition,'' said Roberio Costa, senior economist 
with Citibank. That opposition is organized by the Landless Rural 
Workers Movement which promotes large-scale invasions of land it considers 
unproductive as a way of pressuring the government to speed up agrarian 
reform. The movement has invaded four farms since the government announced 
the cuts and threatens to invade another 22 before the week is out. 
Costa believes that although the plan should provoke a recession pushing 
unemployment beyond already record levels of around 8 percent according 
to official figures _ independent economists believe employment is 
closer to 20 percent _ Brazil is unlikely to experience social upheaval 
similar to Indonesia. While Indonesia experienced a negative growth 
of around 15 percent, Brazil is only expected to experience negative 
growth next year between 1.5 and 3 percent, Costa said.
