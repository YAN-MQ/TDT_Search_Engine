When we come back, violence, and very young women. why did the duck 
cross the road? Well, as I soon found out, it was to get her nine 
babies that were stuck in the storm drain. I made a couple phone calls, 
but... They're quacky ducks. Ducks not dogs. Ducks not dogs. Nobody 
was willing to help out. no. no. You can't? Then I has an idea. I 
went down the street to the home Depot. Not only did they provide 
all the rescue tools, but they also provided Dan and Karen to help 
me. It took some time and a little ingenuity, but we were able to 
put together a little rescue net. You want to get ducks out of a sticky 
situation? Try duct tape. Did I say that? The contraption we made 
wasn't pretty, but, it worked. Going up? One by one, we lifted those 
nine babies to safety. They're all like, "hi mom." We felt so good. 
Thank you, home Depot. You can chalk up one more big fan of your store. 
Actually, make that eleven more. yes, I know the dinosaurs were here 
65 million years ago, not 65,000. It just seems like yesterday.
