Juan Gonzalez was voted the American League's Most Valuable Player 
on Wednesday, overwhelmingly defeating Nomar Garciaparra and Derek 
Jeter to win the award for the second time in three seasons. Gonzalez, 
who had the most RBIs in the AL in 49 years and led Texas to its second 
AL West title in three seasons, received 21 first-place votes and 
seven seconds for 357 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America. ``This is a great moment for everybody, for 
the whole team and the organization,'' Gonzalez said in a conference 
call from Puerto Rico. Garciaparra, who helped Boston win the AL playoff 
wild card, got five firsts, seven seconds and seven thirds and had 
232 points. Jeter, one of four players on the World Series champion 
New York Yankees to receive votes, had two firsts, six seconds and 
three thirds, finishing with 180 points. Gonzalez beat Seattle shortstop 
Alex Rodriguez 290-287 to win the MVP two years ago. ``The first time 
was too tight,'' said Gonzalez, the first Latin American native to 
win two MVPs. And it could be a Latin American sweep if Sammy Sosa 
beats Mark McGwire on Thursday for the NL MVP. ``I'm waiting for tomorrow's 
results ... and praying for Sammy,'' Gonzalez said. Gonzalez hit .318 
with 45 homers and 157 RBIs, the most in the AL since Ted Williams 
and Vern Stephens each had 159 for Boston in 1949. Gonzalez had 101 
RBIs at the All-Star break, becoming only the second player to top 
the century mark going into the All-Star game (Hank Greenberg had 
103 in 1935). By the final week of July, he had 116 RBIs in 105 games, 
bringing up talk he could challenge the record of 190, set by Hack 
Wilson in 1930. ``It's not impossible,'' Gonzalez said then. ``I just 
need to stay healthy and keep working hard.'' But then he was slowed 
by hamstring problems, and the chance to reach that record disappeared. 
Garciaparra, a unanimous choice as the 1997 AL Rookie of the Year, 
hit .323 with 35 homers and 122 RBIs. Jeter, a unanimous pick as the 
1996 AL Rookie of the Year, batted .324 with 19 homers and 84 RBIs, 
providing solid and sometimes spectacular play at shortstop from start 
to finish. Mo Vaughn and Ken Griffey Jr. tied for fourth in the voting 
with 135 points each, followed by Manny Ramirez (127), Bernie Williams 
(103), Albert Belle (96), Rodriguez (92) and Ivan Rodriguez (60). 
Gonzalez gets a dlrs 250,000 bonus for winning the award. Also getting 
bonuses were Garciaparra (dlrs 75,000) and Ivan Rodriguez (dlrs 50,000).
