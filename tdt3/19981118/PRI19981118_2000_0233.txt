Republican governors are debating party strategy and policy at their 
national conference. The meeting, which began today in New Orleans 
puts the spotlight on rising stars in the party. NPR's David Malpes 
reports. As the conference began, two of the party's most promising 
governors said Republicans need to speak more to the every day issues 
in people's lives. Such as the need for safer streets and better schools 
as well as tax cuts. The Bush brothers, George W. of Texas, and Jeb 
of Florida said the party can adhere to conservative principles and 
still reach out to a broader constituency. George Bush said the Republican 
governors had to remind congressional Republicans how important education 
is. And Jeb Bush said, the public is tired of partisan bickering and 
that the party has to act more boldly in pursuing a positive agenda. 
Others here are taunting pragmatism and saying the governors are honing 
the right message for the rest of the party to follow. David Malpes, 
NPR News, New Orleans.
