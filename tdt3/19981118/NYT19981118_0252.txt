What causes cancer? Almost anyone today could tell you that among 
them are carcinogens, viruses, heredity or the body simply wearing 
itself down: anything that prompts living cells to grow uncontrollably 
and choke off the health of their host. Fine. But what exactly causes 
this to happen? In his fascinating new book, ``One Renegade Cell: 
How Cancer Begins,'' Robert A. Weinberg explains the exciting discoveries 
in the field that have taken place in the last few decades, including 
work at the Oncology Research Laboratory at the Whitehead Institute 
for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
where he is the director. (He is also a professor of biology at MIT.) 
A distillation and update of his earlier book, ``Racing to the Beginning 
of the Road: The Search for the Origin of Cancer,'' ``One Renegade 
Cell'' not only presents a clear and comprehensive overview of where 
cancer research stands today; it also offers a breathtaking picture, 
both wonderful and frightening, of the fantastic intricacy of aberrant 
cellular functioning. ``Cancer is a disease of damaged genes,'' Weinberg 
asserts. This is the ``major insight'' afforded by ``the scientific 
revolution that began two decades ago'' and ``continues to this day,'' 
revealing ``the invisible forces that create human cancer.'' What 
damages the genes? In the mid-1970s, at the beginning of the revolution, 
the answer was fought over by two warring camps, one of which had 
evidence that carcinogenic chemicals caused genes to mutate and spur 
out-of-control cellular growth, and the other of which knew that viruses 
caused tumors to develop. Eventually, in 1982, what Weinberg calls 
``a common thread'' was found. Both carcinogens and viruses turned 
out to produce cancer genes called oncogenes, echoing ``the term oncology, 
which refers to the specialty of treating tumors, and the Greek word 
onkos, meaning a lump or mass.'' Weinberg concludes, ``The cell, responding 
to the orders issued by the oncogene, began a program of unconstrained 
proliferation.'' That seemed all there was to the disease. But others, 
pointing to epidemiological data, found this explanation too simple. 
If all it took to produce cancer was a single trigger, then how did 
one account for the steeply rising age-dependent curve of cancer incidence, 
which indicated ``that a multitude of events, happening in succession 
one after another, must occur before a result is achieved, in this 
case a diagnosed tumor''? So in what follows, Weinberg unfolds the 
intricate details of what is now known about this assuredly complex 
process. What it comes down to is not only genetic events that stimulate 
the harmful growth of cells but also events that inhibit the beneficial 
prevention of that growth, like a loss of the cells' ability to commit 
assisted suicide, or apoptotic death, when surrounding cells are threatened. 
Thanks to what is now understood, the author is able to account for 
forms of the disease related to frequent cell growth, like colon cancer, 
which may result in part from the rapid turnover of the colonic epithelial 
cells, or breast cancer, which he says may be on the rise because 
of ``modern nutrition and reproductive habits, which have collaborated 
to increase the number of menstrual cycles that women experience during 
their lifetimes.'' But any summary of ``One Renegade Cell'' is bound 
to distort Weinberg's marvelously compact explication. Little grounding 
in biology is required to comprehend it, yet it makes clear everything 
from how cells communicate by means of protein, to DNA replication 
and the way an apparatus within the cell copy edits the results. What 
is particularly striking is the analogy Weinberg draws between cancer 
cell growth and Darwinian survival of the fittest. The only glitch 
is that sooner or later, evolving cancer cell populations ``kill the 
host organism'' that is ``vital to their own survival.'' In Weinberg's 
estimate, such cancer cell growth will afflict 40 percent of the American 
population at some point in their lives. ``Half of these people will 
be cured and the other half will eventually die of this disease.'' 
What benefits will the developments he describes here so succinctly 
yield? In his concluding chapter, ``An End to the Scourge: Using the 
Knowledge of Cancer's Causes to Develop New Cures,'' he comes out 
first for prevention, the identification and elimination of discrete 
causes of the disease, in particular certain aspects of diet and behavior. 
Surprisingly, he exonerates Western industrialism, pointing out that 
``the rates of most kinds of cancers have held steady over half a 
century, a time when environmental pollution has increased substantially.'' 
Despite this rise, he writes, ``it seems that nearly half of current 
cancer could be prevented through avoidance of tobacco use and high-fat, 
high-meat diets.'' As for the rest, Weinberg foresees new methods 
of early detection and smarter, less harmful drugs resulting from 
``increasingly detailed information on the metabolisms of normal and 
cancerous cells.'' He concludes: ``Those who engineer these successes 
will view the discoveries of the last quarter of the 20th century 
as little more than historical curiosities. But for the moment, we 
allow ourselves to see things quite differently. We can glory in having 
lived while the foundations were being laid. We have moved from substantial 
ignorance to deep insight. We have lived through times of great excitement!''
