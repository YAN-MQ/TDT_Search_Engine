Leaders of Pacific Rim nations are closing out their two-day summit 
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, they have reasserted their resolve to work 
together to support the economically-battered countries in the region. 
Addressing the Asian economic crisis was the main agenda for the meeting, 
but an unexpected dispute has grabbed equal attention. VOA's Amy Vickers 
explains how the United States and host Malaysia, encountered a difference 
of opinion. Prime Ministers and presidents of the member states in 
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum are meeting at a lodge 
near Kuala Lumpur, in the heart of the country's high-tech corridor. 
They are discussing the economic crisis, trade liberalization, and 
the $10 billion rescue package unveiled by Washington and Tokyo to 
help solve Asia's severe debt woes. But vice president Al Gore's controversial 
speech Monday, highlighting U.S. concerns over human rights and democracy, 
has caused divisions among the leaders. Those from Southeast Asia 
are saying politics should be left out of APEC. On the streets of 
Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Gore's statements remain the focus. At a peaceful 
rally Tuesday night, about 200 protesters voiced support for Anwar 
Abraham, the ousted finance minister who is on trial on charges of 
corruption and sodomy. His supporters called for Prime Minster, Mahir 
Tiermohammed, to step down. Some in the reform movement fear U.S. 
support could cause a domestic backlash against reform. Because critics 
could say the movement is sponsored by people outside of the country. 
For the second day in a row, Malaysia's state-run newspapers are full 
of anti-American sentiment, with articles and editorials accusing 
Washington of meddling in Malaysia's internal affairs. Mr. Anwar's 
is also expressing his views in print with Wednesday's Asian Wall 
Street Journal carrying an editorial the deposed leader wrote from 
prison. In it, he urges political reform and calls on Asian leaders 
to take some responsibility for the financial crisis that has battered 
the region. Amy Vickers for VOA News, Kuala Lumpur.
