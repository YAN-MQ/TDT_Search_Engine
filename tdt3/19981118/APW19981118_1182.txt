The evidence is no larger than a match head. Yet, if scientists are 
right, it bears witness to the cataclysm that wiped out the dinosaurs. 
Geophysicist Frank Kyte of the University of California at Los Angeles 
has found what he said is the first known fragment of the gigantic, 
rocky asteroid that scientists believe slammed into Earth 65 million 
years ago. The fragment contains high concentrations of iridium, a 
rare metal, as well as iron, nickel and chromium at levels peculiar 
to extraterrestrial objects. Kyte said the most reasonable explanation 
is that it came from the asteroid. Other scientists said the geochemical 
analysis shows that the rock chip probably did originate from space. 
But whether it was shed from the asteroid that doomed the dinosaurs 
remains open to debate, they said. An analysis of the fragment was 
published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. The coarse-grained 
fleck was pulled from the floor of the Pacific Ocean in a thin layer 
of the planet's crust known as the K/T boundary. Scientists believe 
the layer formed from the debris that settled back to Earth after 
being blown into the atmosphere by the asteroid. Other researchers 
have found grit in the K/T boundary that might have been part of the 
pulverized asteroid, but the traces were too small to analyze conclusively. 
``This is the first object recovered from the K/T boundary that is 
unarguably meteoric,'' Kyte said. ``My personal interpretations will 
be subject to review. But in the end we will learn more about one 
of the worst days in the history of the Earth.'' If the K/T boundary 
is the smoking gun indicating a cataclysmic event, the fragment could 
be a bullet fired by the gun, Kyte said. The doomsday rock is thought 
to have eliminated 70 percent of all plant and animal species and 
changed the course of evolution. ``The K/T asteroid was something 
like six miles (ten kilometers) across, and it got blasted into pieces 
that would fit on the head of a pin,'' said Jeff Pleschia, a crater 
specialist with the U.S. Geological Service in Flagstaff, Arizona. 
The K/T boundary is nearly devoid of signs of past life, but is full 
of blasted quartz crystals, iridium and other traces suggesting the 
planet absorbed a tremendous blow from a space object. Fossils of 
dinosaurs and many other creatures found in the older, lower rock 
layers are not present in the higher, more recent strata, suggesting 
a mass extinction. Kyte first displayed the rock chip at a scientific 
meeting at NASA three years ago. Even though it was found in the K/T 
boundary, critics suggested it might be just a stray fleck of interplanetary 
debris. Since then, Kyte has used an electron microscope and other 
high-resolution equipment to examine the fragment's molecular structure. 
Kyte's analysis buttresses the theory proposed in 1980 by geologist 
Walter Alvarez of the University of California at Berkeley that the 
dinosaurs vanished because of a collision with a huge asteroid or 
comet. At first, the theory had few supporters. But in 1989, scientists 
found evidence of a 180-mile (290-kilometer)-wide crater gouged out 
of the Earth on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. What species didn't die 
in the immediate blast probably struggled to survive in an extended 
period of global cooling and environmental havoc. In 1997, researchers 
drilling into sediment off the Florida coast said they found the ``smoking 
gun'' of the asteroid collision _ a thin reddish stripe that was called 
the ``fireball layer.'' Direct proof is hard to come by, however. 
According to some estimates, up to 99 percent of the asteroid vaporized 
on impact with a force greater than all of the nuclear weapons ever 
made. The rest was scattered for thousands of miles _ 5,000 miles 
(8,046 kilometers) in the case of this fragment. ``The older something 
is, the harder it becomes to find a piece of the original,'' Pleschia 
said. ``It is incredibly painstaking work. You would have to be incredibly 
lucky to find a fist-sized chunk of this asteroid.''
