Amnesty International is saying thousands of American Children in 
juvenile detention centers suffer excessive incarceration. Physical 
abuse there and other human rights violations. In a new report, the 
group says 38 states house juvenile offenders and adult facilities. 
That is right, 38 states do house juvenile offenders in adult facilities. 
Amnesty says children in adult prisons are denied education, are in 
constant contact with career criminals, are more likely to be beaten 
by staff or sexually assaulted. The report says children in the United 
States are often incarcerated for minor infringements of law, such 
as fighting in school or disobeying parents. The human rights group 
says most alarming are executions of people convicted of crimes committed 
as juveniles. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Justice 
Department on all of that.
