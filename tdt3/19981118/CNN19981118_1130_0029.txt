The White House says republicans on the house Judiciary committee 
are violating fundamental fairness in their investigation of President 
Clinton. Impeachment hearings begin tomorrow, and the White House 
is angry because its lawyers will only get 30 minutes to cross-examine 
the chief witness, independent counsel Ken Starr. Republican leaders 
are also saying committee democrats will not be allowed to ask about 
matters such as the current investigation into Starr's conduct. That 
and republican plans to expand the investigation beyond Monica lewinsky 
have the White House crying foul. The American public, I think, wants 
fairness out of this process. And there's nothing that's fair and 
bipartisan when the republicans go off and expand and go off on a 
fishing expedition. And at the same time tell the White House, "well, 
we think that you have to keep your questions to the area that we 
decide." That's not fair. And I think the American public will -- 
it will reinforce the American public's view that this process isn't 
fair. Some democrats say they will boycott the hearings if they are 
expanded.
