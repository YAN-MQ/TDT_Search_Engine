With the U.S. Central Bank citing unusual strains in financial market 
Tuesday, decided to cut its key federal funds rate 25 basis points 
to 43/4 percent. That is lowest level it has been in four years. It 
was the third cut by the Federal Reserve in 7 weeks. Battle Cox chief 
investment strategist and Harris Investment Management in Chicago 
says this most recent cut was responding to what was going on in the 
economy, not in the capital markets. The fact that we have had, for 
example, a 45 percent drop in scrap steel prices, one of the sharpest 
drops ever, in the last few months. We have got the quantity indices 
once again probing very long-term loathes. These are the kinds of 
things that the Fed can then say, well we will forget about the markets 
now and just say what do we need to do to prevent a recession next 
year? The Central Bank says this third cut should help maintain America's 
economic expansion now in an eighth year and keep inflation under 
control. Despite the cut, Wall Street lost ground Tuesday. The Dow 
Jones Industrial Average shedding nearly 25 points to 8986. The Broader 
Market, S&P 500, and the NASDAQ, gained.
