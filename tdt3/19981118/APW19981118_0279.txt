Tamil Tiger rebels and government troops broke a lull in their fighting 
in northern Sri Lanka with clashes that left at least 13 people dead, 
the military said Wednesday. Six guerrillas were killed and 36 wounded 
Tuesday when government troops attacked a rebel bunker line near Paranthan 
town in Kilinochchi district, said Maj. Kumar Dewage, a military spokesman. 
There were no military casualties in that clash 275 kilometers (170 
miles) north of the capital, Colombo, the spokesman said. Two more 
rebels were killed in a clash with a military patrol near the town 
of Mankulam, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. In nearby Mannar 
district, four rebels and a soldier were killed when troops ambushed 
guerrillas in the jungle, said Dewage. Fighting has trailed off since 
the last major battle on Sept. 27, when the rebels overran northern 
Kilinochchi town, killing nearly a thousand soldiers. Both sides have 
been recruiting more fighters since then. The rebels are fighting 
for a separate homeland for minority Tamils, who claim they are discriminated 
against by the majority Sinhalese, who dominate the government and 
military. More than 56,000 people have been killed since fighting 
began in 1983.
