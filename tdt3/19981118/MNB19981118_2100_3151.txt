As we mentioned, U.N. weapons inspectors were back on the job in Iraq 
today, and they characterized the day as routine. But the tension, 
the threat of military action remain high. It's what comes next that 
will be the difficult part here. As NBC news Pentagon correspondent, 
Jim Miklaszewski reports, a lot has changed in the week since their 
last inspection. That's where the next showdown comes in. Nearly three 
weeks after Saddam Hussein shut them down, U.N. weapons inspectors 
encountered no problems today as they set out to resume their search 
for Iraq's deadly weapons. The U.S. has threatened to attack without 
warning if Iraq interferes, but intelligence sources tell NBC news 
that in the past few wks, Saddam's stepped up his shell game, moving 
weapons material to new hiding places that could take inspectors weeks, 
perhaps months to track down. They need to redop their intelligence 
network. Instead, U.N. inspectors will launch an immediate challenge 
by demanding weapons records and documents they know to exist. NBC 
news has learned that inspectors specifically want nine computer disks 
that provide details of Iraq's production and placement of chemical 
and biological weapons, records of human experimentation, and one 
document that apparently shows Saddam was using part of the U.N.'s 
oil-for-food program not to feed Iraqis but to buy spare parts and 
produce fuel for missiles. A senior U.S. official tells NBC news that 
even if Iraq refuses to turn over documents, that's not enough to 
start a war. That puts pressure on inspectors to find weapons or face 
a confrontation. The Burden is on the inspectors to turn out the proof. 
The Burden should have been on Saddam. And tonight two more U.S. warships 
are headed to the gulf to back up U.N. inspectors. Pentagon sources 
report the inspections can play out for another six weeks and then 
decide to force another showdown with Saddam or call off the troops.
