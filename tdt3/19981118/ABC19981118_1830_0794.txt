There is growing concern tonight about the misuse, of a little device 
called the laser pointer, which puts out a very intense beam of light 
in some cases, from a great distance away. Earlier this month, we 
reported that someone aimed lasers from the ground at two American 
pilots flying over Bosnia and blinded them temporarily. The beam can 
also be confused with the beam from a scope on a gun. And they're 
getting more popular with children. Here's ABC's James Walker. Laser 
pointers. The current rage among teenagers. They like point them at 
people to make people laugh and stuff. It's kind of a prank. As prices 
for laser pointers have fallen from $300 to $8, youngsters are flashing 
them everywhere, at concert halls, in classrooms, pointing the lasers 
at teachers. Some school districts have banned them. We basically 
ban anything that's disruptive to the educational process. The food 
and drug administration warns they are more than a Nuisance. Alfred 
ripa was driving his bus in New Jersey, when a laser beam was pointed 
at his eyes. I just lost control of the bus, and by the time I could 
look up, here was a Telephone pole coming right towards me. And police 
officers are worried, too, because many handguns are equipped with 
laser sighting devices. The problem is the laser beam emitted by a 
laser pointer or weapon is similar. The pointer. The pistol. So police 
officers know they are being targeted but they can't tell if it's 
a prank or a threat. It was scary. Officer Stanley zajac and two other 
officers were on night patrol in meriden, Connecticut, when teenagers 
pointed lasers at them. I had a split second to figure out what it 
was. We ended up drawing down on three juvenile -- turned out to be 
three juveniles. Something for every teenager who plays with a laser 
to think about. James Walker, ABC News, meriden, Connecticut.
