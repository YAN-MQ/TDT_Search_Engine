Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." My dad always said: as soon as 
I get a computer you'll come out with something better. So, to make 
sure people like dad have the latest computer we invented your:)ware-- 
technology that grows with you. For just $49.95 a month you can buy 
a computer with an Intel Pentium II processor Internet access and 
in two years you can trade it in towards the purchase of a new one. 
What do you call this thing? Your:)ware. Call 1-800-gateway and let's 
talk about your:)ware. The day we started business, we had over 30 
years experience as the world leader in satellite services and systems. 
We are the world leader in digital satellite television. And, the 
world's leading provider of private business networks. Introducing 
Hughes, a familiar name with a brand new focus. When you need the 
best in satellite and wireless communications. We make it happen.
