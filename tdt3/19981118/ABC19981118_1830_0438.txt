Vice President Gore and the leaders of 20 other Asian countries have 
finished their summit meeting in Malaysia. There was a serious debate 
at this summit about how free and how open the global marketplace 
should be. The U.S. has been pushing, as always, for open markets 
-- which is not always politically popular here at home. Witness the 
international trade in steel. Here is ABC's Betsy Stark. At the port 
of New Orleans, the traffic in imported steel is so thick they're 
running out of dock space to store it. We have steel from Russia, 
Brazil, Malaysia, literally all over the world. Japanese steel exports 
to the U.S. have soared 141% since last year, Korean exports are up 
95%. And the steel for sale is cheap. As many countries overseas have 
stopped buying, supplies have grown. And more steel has been shipped 
to the U.S., pushing the cost down from an average of $330 a ton last 
year to $230 this year. Isn't the global economy a wonderful thing? 
Well, yes, if you're an American manufacturer who makes cars or refrigerators 
and cheap steel is keeping your costs down. But the global economy 
is not a wonderful thing if you're an American steelworker. Prices 
for foreign steel are now so low even the most efficient American 
steel companies say they cannot match them and still make a profit. 
The industry estimates 6,000 steelworkers have lost their jobs so 
far this year, and another 10,000 have been forced to work shorter 
weeks or take early retirement. It's not right, it's not up to the 
American steelworker in this case to bail out the financial crisis 
in Russia or in Japan or in Korea. For the U.S. government, it's a 
dilemma. On the one hand, the Clinton administration is encouraging 
Asian countries to export their way back to economic health. On the 
other, it's being asked to protect the American steel industry by 
taxing imported steel to make it cost more. Other American industries 
hurt by the surge in foreign imports will be watching closely. Steel 
is just the first of several trade conflicts expected to come. Betsy 
Stark, ABC News.
