Independent counsel Ken Starr is expected to vigorously defend his 
investigation of President Clinton when he testifies tomorrow before 
the house Judiciary committee. Starr will be the first witness at 
the impeachment inquiry. CNN has obtained a copy of his statement. 
Starr says, in his words -- A spokesman for Starr says he sees his 
testimony as a duty. This is a new episode. It's a very serious and 
solemn matter, and the committee has before it, very weighty issues 
that they have to consider. Our mood is very much upbeat in the sense 
of we have done and continue to do our duty. And I think you'll hear 
judge Starr talk about that tomorrow. His duty to gather the facts, 
present them to the Congress, and then have them make the decision.
