Of all the pain and suffering Russia's decaying economy is producing, 
perhaps the children are feeling it the worst. Especially those with 
no homes or families. Betsy Aaron has more. What do you do when you're 
a kid and your parents send you out to make some money? You wash car 
windows. It doesn't matter how old you are. It doesn't matter that 
you should probably be in school. Genya's 10, and she brags that in 
one day she once made 125,000 rubles, about $10, washing windows. 
"Yeah, I live at home," she says. "But sometimes I have to Hang out." 
"We all used to sniff glue," he says. "But now we quit, except for 
maybe one girl." They smoke. What about beer? That happens. Social 
workers, many of them still in school, spend their time on the streets 
trying to reach these kids. What these kids need is attention. Nobody's 
taking care of them. Too many parents are alcoholics or drug addicts 
or just desperate with no jobs and no home and no prospects. You know, 
sometimes dad starts yelling at me, and I just go out. One day, these 
kids were told they were going to meet a very important person, the 
head of UNICEF, the woman in charge of kids at the United Nations. 
So genya and the others told their stories, and so did the social 
workers. It's really hard to convince those kids that we're not from 
the police, that we won't report them. Are there any services you 
can try and connect their families up with sometimes? There are government 
structures. But they have a repressive character -- the so-called 
"commission for juveniles." UNICEF provides some money for what it 
sees as a growing problem on the streets. The goal is to get to the 
kids before they get to the streets. Sometimes the lost kids end up 
in shelters. Slava is 8. three months ago, his mother left him, saying 
she'd be back in a week. Vasily can't stay at home because he doesn't 
have one. What do you do when you just can't remember the last time 
you saw your mother? My mom used to work, and now she's gone. Bridget's 
mother died of a drug overdose. Ask any of them what they want. "A 
family," they say. "A home," they say. I have a dream. I want to grow 
up as soon as possible. "because," she says, "it's sad being a little 
girl." Betsy Aaron, CNN, Moscow.
