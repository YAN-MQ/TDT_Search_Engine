MULLINS: Thirsting for the answer to today's Geography quiz. We could 
tell. In celebration of the release of this year's Beaujolais Neuveu, 
we are asking for the first country to welcome the young vine. You 
see a time honored tradition, the wine goes on sale just seconds after 
the clock strikes midnight tonight around the globe. The answer is 
a place where it is already well past midnight, New Zealand, right 
near the international dateline. Coming up, the favored music of neo-nazis 
on PRI, Public Radio International.
