KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. trade officials expressed outrage 
Wednesday over Japan's refusal to lower trade barriers, describing 
Tokyo's behavior as inexcusable and pledging the issue would be raised 
during President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit. Clinton's official 
visit to Japan Thursday comes on the heels of a Pacific Rim economic 
summit in Kuala Lumpur, where the United States and Japan took opposite 
sides in a bitter trade dispute. American officials had hoped to reduce 
or eliminate tariffs on dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of trade, but failed 
to forge a pact covering nine industries because of opposition from 
Japan to lowering border taxes on two of them, fish and wood products. 
Before leaving Malaysia at the conclusion of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation summit on Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky told reporters that ``Japan refused to exercise any leadership 
and that is inexcusable. ... It is an unconscionable outcome.'' Although 
other APEC members objected to the risks of the tariff cuts in the 
face of the economic crisis, Japan's refusal to open two sectors that 
are politically sensitive back home derailed the pact. In the end 
the group decided to pass it along to the 124-nation World Trade Organization 
in Geneva, where they hope to attract other countries to sign on to 
the tariff cuts so they can begin to be implemented. And Barshefsky 
suggested she would raise the tariff issue again. ``Japan was isolated, 
and Japan will be called to account,'' she told reporters. Clinton 
leaves Washington early Wednesday on a six-day journey to Japan, South 
Korea and Guam. He had planned to begin that trip in Malaysia at the 
APEC summit, but had to send U.S. Vice President Al Gore in his place 
because of the U.S.-Iraq standoff. For its part, Japan seems to be 
tired of talking about trade. The trade dispute ``is not the only 
issue in Japan-U.S. relations,'' said Sadaaki Numata, spokesperson 
for Japan's Prime Minister. Sadaaki said Japan will explain to Clinton 
what it is doing to deal with the Asian economic crisis. Japan's own 
economic policy will also be on the agenda when Clinton meets with 
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. In Kuala Lumpur, Obuchi told 
a group of Asian leaders Wednesday that there is no reason to worry 
about Japan's economy, even though many forecasters say it's unlikely 
to grow at all this year. ``Japan's individual savings are high, and 
its foreign reserves are big. I want others not to worry at all,'' 
Obuchi was quoted as saying by a Japanese government official. The 
prime minister sought to reassure the leaders that a 24 trillion yen 
(dlrs 196 billion) package of new spending and tax cuts, unveiled 
Monday, would lift Japan out of its deepest recession since World 
War II. ``Japan's recovery and aid are vital to Asian economies,'' 
Obuchi told reporters just before boarding a flight bound for Tokyo. 
Japan accounts for more than two-thirds of the region's economic power. 
Critics worry the package may not be as effective as the government 
hopes. Japan has implemented seven previous stimulus plans, but the 
economy has been stagnant for much of the past five years. Obuchi 
also sought to assure the leaders that Japan is doing its part to 
lead the region out of its economic crisis by reminding them of his 
country's pledge to provide dlrs30 billion in aid to ailing Asian 
economies.
