It is time now for some of our affiliates to take a short two-minute 
break. We will back soon. This is VOA News Now. You know, I was seeing 
a story the other day. Some people have really gotten to the point 
that it is like 409 days to the millennium. Some people are counting 
down the hours and the minutes and all of that with-- When does the 
millennium begin? 2000 or 2001? Oh, please, yes, I think they, no, 
they settled that a lot, most people did. But all kinds of crazy people 
have got marketing schemes trying to make a buck, naturally, in with 
anything these days. Well, the city in Britain, they are really trying 
to pursue this, too, make a big deal about it. They are investing 
around $10 billion to turn London into the millennium city. On Tuesday, 
culture and tourism officials announced plans to upgrade or build 
hotels, museums, and galleries in hopes of attracting millions of 
visitors in the year 2000, and of course, beyond. The centerpiece 
of the project the $1.6 billion Millennium Dome is being east of London 
in Greenwich. British officials call the Greenwich the home of time.
