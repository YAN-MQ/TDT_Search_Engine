United Nations' Weapons Inspectors returned to their work in Iraq, 
today, with what appeared to be full Iraqi cooperation. UN spokesman 
Fred Eckhart said Baghdad provided the necessary escorts for the inspection 
teams which carried out operations with no problems. But first the 
teams aren't expected to carry out any of the surprise visits that 
caused repeated tensions with Iraq. Their first inspections are expected 
to be limited to sites where they already have cameras and censors 
for long-term monitoring.
