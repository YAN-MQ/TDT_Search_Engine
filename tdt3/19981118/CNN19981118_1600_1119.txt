That's "Dollars & Sense." Back to you, Toria. Next in "Headline Sports" 
-- a familiar face is the American league's most valuable player. 
Now for "diskette world"ttTRAVEL news -- notebook COMPUTERS ARE traveling 
lighter with built-in superdisk drives. Only the superdisk DRIVE WORKS 
with both regular floppies and 120-MEGABYTE SUPERDISK diskettes. Floppies 
everywhere are thrilled because a built-in SUPERDISK IS two drives 
in one, and other DRIVES ARE on the way out. We can save a little. 
SUPERDISK can save a lot. Together, we can save the world. Get it 
in NEC notebooks. @u d Stay tuned for the answer after sports. Matt 
Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports."
