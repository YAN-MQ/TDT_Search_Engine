Today, the house Judiciary committee issued a list of people who may 
be deposed. It includes the attorney for Kathleen Willey, the woman 
who has accused the president of making an unwanted sexual advance 
outside the oval office. Also on the list are White House deputy counsel 
Bruce Lindsey and Mr. clinton's private attorney, Bob Bennett. The 
full committee will debate the list and may vote on it as early as 
tomorrow. House Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde is calling 
for cooperation from democrats and the White House. Some cooperation 
from them is very desirable and would be helpful. The democrats continue 
to stress the issue of fairness, I'm doing everything I can think 
of to be fair, without totally surrendering the fact that we are the 
majority party and in control of the committee. The American public, 
I think, wants fairness out of this process. And there's nothing that's 
fair and bipartisan when the republicans go off and expand and go 
off on a fishing expedition, and at the same time, tell the White 
House, "well, we think that you have to keep your questions to the 
area that we decide."
