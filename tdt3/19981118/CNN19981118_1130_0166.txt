House republicans have selected bib loving ston to be the speaker 
of the house. He will likely replace Newt Gingrich when the 106th 
Congress convenes next year and the full house elects the speaker. 
Gingrich announced that he would leave Congress after republicans 
lost ground to democrats in the national elections. Livingston has 
an idea how he will preside over the new Congress. My first order 
is really to bring order to the House of Representatives, pride in 
the institution, and instill in the American people the understanding 
that we are all, republican and democrat and independent, hard-working 
people who are working in the best interest of what we believe is 
in the best interest of our constituents.
