Picasso and stradivari are two names that translate to big bucks. 
In New York, sotheby's has auctioned off a Pablo picasso painting 
that hung in the national gallery of art for a decade. The cubist 
work, called "nude," sold for $11 million yesterday. In London, a 
stradivari violin is expected to be the highlight of a Christie's 
auction tomorrow. The instrument, made in 1698, is expected to sell 
for more than $1 million.
