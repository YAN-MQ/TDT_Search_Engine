This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Thursday. A strong storm in the upper midwest has been 
producing blizzard-like weather over North Dakota and Minnesota. By 
late in the day Thursday, it'll be across the northern Great Lakes, 
still bringing some snow and wind to the region and also spreading 
that windy, wet weather toward the east coast. There'll be a mix of 
rain and snow over sections of New England. The west is relatively 
quiet, but there's a strong storm off the northwest coast that will 
make for a wet and windy weekend. Thursday's highs -- 20s and 30s 
through the north central part of the country. We'll see 60s and 70s 
in the south with a couple of 80s in southern Texas and southern Florida. 
Looking ahead to Friday, look for rain and snow in the northeast, 
heavy rain and wind developing across the northwest. On Saturday, 
the rain continues in the northwest with windy conditions. We'll see 
a few showers in Texas and also snow showers over northern New England. 
Sunday, still wet in the northwest.
