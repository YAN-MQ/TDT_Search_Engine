Already under a political death sentence in its present form, Britain's 
unelected House of Lords has repeatedly blocked a bill to change the 
voting system for European Parliament elections in what the Labor 
Party government calls ``an abuse of power.'' The Lords were expected 
to reject the bill for the fifth straight time Wednesday in an unprecedented 
show of defiance that Prime Minister Tony Blair's government blames 
on hereditary peers _ aristocrats who overwhelmingly support the opposition 
Conservative Party. Another defeat would kill the bill and would be 
used by Labor as a major argument for its plan to abolish the 600-year-old 
right of hereditary peers to vote in the Lords. ``This issue is no 
longer about the best electoral system to vote for the European Parliament,'' 
Home Secretary Jack Straw said after the Lords rejected the bill by 
a 261-198 vote Tuesday night. ``It is about the right of unelected 
hereditary peers _ accountable to no one but the Tory party _ to frustrate 
the government's program,'' Straw said. The current parliamentary 
session ends this week and Queen Elizabeth II is due to open the new 
session Tuesday by reading out the legislative program for the coming 
year _ likely to include a bill to strip the hereditary peers of voting 
rights. The government can get a measure rejected by the Lords passed 
automatically in the next session of Parliament. But Straw said reintroducing 
the bill in the new session would be too late to set up the voting 
system _ which critics say gives too much power to party machines 
_ for European Parliament elections in July. The new system, involving 
constituency boundary changes, could not be in place until 2004 elections. 
Conservative opponents of the bill, both lifetime and hereditary peers, 
are supported by dozens of peers with no party affiliation, some Labor 
rebels, and senior Church of England bishops who have seats in the 
upper chamber. But Blair's aides said that without the votes of Tory 
hereditary peers, the measure would have passed by 36 votes on Tuesday. 
The bill provides that instead of voting for a single candidate in 
each district, voters choose a party. The party would then allocate 
seats to its nominees, with the number of seats based on the proportion 
of the overall vote won by each party. The system is used in several 
European countries. But British opponents say the measure deprives 
voters of the right to choose a candidate and allows party apparatchiks 
to control who gets elected.
