More than 5,000 Malaysians sought refuge in mosques, churches and 
community halls after floods threatened to engulf their homes, local 
news reports said Wednesday. Nearly 2,000 residents in the Baling 
district of northern Kedah state have been evacuated from their homes 
since heavy rains began Sunday, the New Straits Times said. Koh Tsu 
Koon, chief minister of Penang state, warned people living in low-lying 
areas that the situation will worsen as meteorologists predict more 
rain that could result in rivers spilling over their banks Thursday. 
``Relief centers have been set up at mosques, community halls, churches 
and temples to accommodate the victims,' Koh said. No deaths or injuries 
have been reported. This year's monsoon season has brought heavier 
than usual rains in many parts of Malaysia due to La Nina, a weather 
pattern related to the El Nino phenomenon that earlier brought unusually 
hot or cold conditions to Pacific Rim nations.
