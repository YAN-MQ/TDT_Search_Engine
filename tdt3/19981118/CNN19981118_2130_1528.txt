The bow has been placed on New York City's largest wrapped gift. Jeweler 
Cartier decorated the outside of its fifth avenue building today with 
a giant red ribbon and bow. Santa claus, Christmas carolers and six 
14-foot toy soldiers were on hand as the building was wrapped. The 
Cartier bow has been a New York holiday tradition for 13 years.
