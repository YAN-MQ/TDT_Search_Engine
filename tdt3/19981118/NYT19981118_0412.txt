Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., is no friend of Bill Clinton's. But 
the 10-term moderate is one of a small though growing number of Republicans 
who say they would vote against impeaching the president, barring 
any new information in the inquiry against him. ``Get it over quickly, 
censure the president and let the new Congress start with a clean 
slate,'' said Porter, one of five Republicans who said in interviews 
that they would oppose impeachment. ``This is an albatross around 
the neck of Congress.'' On the eve of the high-stakes testimony from 
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, before the House Judiciary 
Committee, many House Republicans are expressing doubts and anguish 
over the panel's inquiry, which the public overwhelmingly wants to 
end. With their party holding only an 11-vote margin that will dwindle 
to six votes in the next Congress, it would take only a few other 
Republicans among those who say they are wavering to kill any chance 
of impeaching Clinton. Thirty-one Democrats voted for the Republican 
inquiry in October, but the vast majority now say that, based on current 
facts, they would not vote to impeach Clinton, whom Starr has accused 
of obstructing justice by concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
In addition to Porter, four other Republicans said they would oppose 
impeaching the president: Peter King and Jack Quinn of New York, Christopher 
Shays of Connecticut and Mark Souder of Indiana. Shays told reporters 
Wednesday that there are ``conceivably 20 Republicans'' who would 
oppose impeaching Clinton. Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, who 
will succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker, has reportedly made clear to 
Rep. Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that he wants 
the investigation wrapped up before he takes over in January. ``One 
thing we can be certain of is that Bob wants to get on with his agenda,'' 
said Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., who is one of Livingston's closest 
confidantes in the House. Even conservative Republicans who have signaled 
that they would support impeachment, like Ron Packard of California 
and Mark Sanford of South Carolina, concede that the House is unlikely 
to impeach the president. ``People's appetite for stepping out on 
the impeachment plank has substantially diminished,'' said Sanford. 
Impeachment critics cite the Senate's almost-certain rejection of 
any impeachment resolution, public opinion polls and the mid-term 
elections as evidence that the inquiry is doomed on the House floor. 
``To keep picking at this wound, knowing that nothing is going to 
happen, I think is wrong,'' said Rep. Amo Houghton Jr., R-N.Y., who 
declined to say how he would vote. Souder, a two-term conservative, 
said, ``It's important to send a signal to Chairman Hyde and the Republican 
leadership, they don't have the votes. The public doesn't want impeachment, 
but our base can't stomach his behavior. So it puts Republicans in 
a very difficult position.'' Shays added, ``If Republicans could rewrite 
history, we certainly would have handled this differently. But it's 
out of the box and now we don't know how to get it back in.'' Unlike 
these vocal opponents of impeachment, many Republicans say they have 
been too busy, first with the mid-term elections and then with Wednesday's 
leadership races, to pay attention to the impeachment proceedings. 
Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the powerful chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, said he has been wrestling with momentous issues 
like taxes, Medicare and Social Security. What about impeachment? 
``You're out of my league,'' Archer said Wednesday. ``I haven't thought 
it through.'' House Republicans say each new development in the investigation 
seems to sink its chances to bring down Clinton. They point, for example, 
to the 22 hours of conversations between Monica Lewinsky and her erstwhile 
friend, Linda Tripp, that were released on Tuesday. ``The Tripp tapes 
will be the final blow against Starr's case,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough, 
R-Fla., who is undecided on impeachment. ``Americans will probably 
be repulsed by the tapes and anyone aligned with Linda Tripp.'' For 
that reason, many Republicans say they wish the whole issue would 
just go away. ``This is very difficult,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, 
a conservative Californian and frequent critic of the president. ``Most 
of us would rather not have to vote on this. But we can't carve out 
an exception for the president for lying.'' Republican disenchantment 
with impeachment reveals a gulf between House Republicans in general 
and those on the Judiciary Committee, who are for the most part more 
conservative than their colleagues. And despite Hyde's insistence 
the committee will deal only with impeachment, the dimming prospects 
for that outcome are fueling efforts by other Republicans to devise 
alternatives, like censure. ``More and more doors are opening to alternative 
solutions, and the White House is listening,'' said Tauzin. ``Remember, 
the Judiciary Committee was told to consider impeachment or any other 
recommendation. They could recommend censure.'' Some Republicans, 
like Shays, say censuring the president would set a bad precedent. 
``To censure or rebuke would open the door to a censure of the week 
or censure of the month,'' Shays told reporters on Wednesday. But 
other Republicans say the alternative route may be the only one with 
enough support to pass the House. ``Given the fact there aren't enough 
votes for impeachment, if censure is the only available option, then 
that will be the option,'' said Sanford. ``It's the only one that 
has a chance of surviving.''
