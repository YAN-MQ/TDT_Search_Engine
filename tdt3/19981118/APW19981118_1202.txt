New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson was decorated Wednesday with Spain's 
Grand Cross of Civil Merit. Johnson received the honor from Deputy 
Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos on the second day of a trade 
and cultural mission to Spain at the head of a delegation of state 
tourism officials and business leaders. Cascos, who visited New Mexico 
in April, said the decoration recognized the governor's efforts to 
build on bilateral historical ties that stretch back four centuries. 
He also called for more cultural and commercial exchange between Spain 
and New Mexico in the future. Agreements to broaden student exchange 
programs at both the university and secondary school levels are expected 
to be signed by the delegation before it leaves Spain Saturday. The 
agenda also includes meetings with Culture Minister Esperanza Aguirre 
and Crown Prince Felipe.
