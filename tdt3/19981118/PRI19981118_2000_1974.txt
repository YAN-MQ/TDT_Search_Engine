There is more trouble in Indonesia. At least 30 people have been injured 
in a clash between student demonstrators and troops in the eastern 
Indonesian city of Ambon. Students were also out again in the streets 
of the capital, Jikharta in support of calls for political reform. 
Several thousand protesters chanted slogans against the government 
and the military. Some carried flowers in the memory of the 14 students 
killed in clashes with troops and police last week. From the BBC Newsroom 
in London, this is Pamela McCall for The World.
