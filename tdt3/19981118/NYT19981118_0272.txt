Remember ``Zen and the Art of Archery''? At the peak moment of this 
perennially popular book by the German philosopher Eugen Herrigel, 
the Zen archer hits the bull's-eye, although he shoots the arrow in 
total darkness. ``Melodramatic'' is how the composer John Cage assessed 
this story, and he offered another. A Japanese friend, he said, told 
him of a highly esteemed archer who had never hit the bull's-eye even 
in broad daylight. West subtly meets East in these two anecdotes. 
In the German view, success is the goal and the arts are supporting 
players to the ego's yearning for mastery. In Zen, success is considered 
a figment of the ego. Ultimately nothing is gained, so the goal disappears. 
There is only the moment, which calls the master archer's whole being 
into play. If you're truly one with the target, why bother to release 
the arrow? ``The Art of 20th-Century Zen,'' an exhibition at the Japan 
Society, gives a personal face to these issues by focusing on 14 contemporary 
Japanese Zen masters who are also master calligrapher-painters. The 
curator, Audrey Yoshiko Seo of the College of William and Mary in 
Virginia, has enlisted the help of the Asian scholar Stephen Addiss. 
In fact, it was Mr. Addiss's 1989 exhibition, ``The Art of Zen,'' 
covering the period 1600 to 1925, that gave Seo the idea. Addiss had 
invited Keido Fukushima, abbot of Tofuku-ji monastery in Kyoto and 
a noted calligrapher, to come to the Spencer Museum at the University 
of Kansas to give a brush demonstration. ``Seeing an actual Zen master 
do brushwork was very inspiring, because you're seeing it as an actual 
practice,'' Seo says. Her show, which will be on view through Jan. 
10 and will then travel to three other museums, begins with the turn-of-the-century 
reformer Nantenbo Nakahara, who died in 1925. It ends with Fukushima. 
Although calligraphy is part of a Zen master's bag of skills _ Fukushima 
receives more than 3,000 requests a year for his brushwork _ some 
masters are particularly adept at it. Among them was his teacher, 
Zenkei Shibayama, a friend of D.T. Suzuki, the scholar and pioneer 
of Zen in the West. (The two older men collaborated on a graceful 
painting here, centered on the word myo, meaning wondrous.) In 1964, 
Suzuki persuaded Shibayama to leave his monastery, Nanzen-ji, to lecture 
in the United States, a mission his successor has inherited. Fukushima 
now tours America once a year. Zen came to the West mostly by way 
of scholars and popularizers like Suzuki and Alan Watts, who infused 
it with a philosophical bent that has been hard to shake. In Japan, 
Seo says, Zen is not a philosophy but a monastic practice, which culminates 
in the transmission ceremony in which teacher acknowledges disciple. 
(The catalogue doubles as an excellent summary of these vivid masters 
and their daunting training.) On one recent American tour, Fukushima 
gave a dramatic calligraphy demonstration at Columbia University in 
New York. Sitting on the floor, accompanied by an alert young assistant, 
he chatted freely with the audience. Suddenly he stopped talking. 
He meditated for a few moments, seeming to reach deep within himself. 
Then he picked up a thick, chunky brush and paused. Strike! The deed 
was done: a dense black circle. He gave it away. For a Zen-master-to-be, 
the struggle to let go of the self is relentless. Decades of rigorous 
training _ rising well before dawn, meditating motionless for hours, 
laboring in the monastery, facing the teacher _ are summed up in the 
phrase ``A dragon gives birth to another dragon.'' The ceaseless process 
of emptying oneself of conceptual and emotional baggage raises one's 
awareness of one's ``dragon nature.'' The new Zen master joins the 
lineage of those who act out of mu-shin _ literally ``no-mind,'' but 
also ``enlightened mind'' _ the same mind with which they will paint, 
sit, pour tea and teach. The Zen brush is wielded by everything you 
are, and most particularly the zero point where ``you'' are not. Nonstriving 
is true realization, Addiss writes. He quotes Dogen Zenji, the 13th-century 
founder of one of the two major branches of Zen: ``To study the Way 
is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. To 
forget the self is to be enlightened by all things.'' The momentous 
complexities of being truly simple are apparent in Fukushima's painting 
``Mountain Is Mountain.'' The three characters of the title materialize 
in thick black ink strokes. The repeated character ``mountain'' includes 
streaks of ``flying white,'' the spots where the brush moved so fast 
it left bare paper. The word mountain has special significance in 
Zen. It refers to the world of form _ the phenomena of daily life. 
It is also a favorite synonym for a Zen master, who sits like a mountain 
amid worldly tumult. And it signifies the dharma, or cosmic order, 
itself _ that which moves mountains. ``The Zen master is the world 
is the dharma,'' in a phrase. But the two characters for ``mountain,'' 
deliberately differ from each other. All is One, yet each thing is 
also purely itself. One dragon is not another. And in truth, each 
master has his own style. (The lone female abbot in the show, Kendo 
Kojima, a fighter for the rights of women in Japanese Zen, is pointedly 
a token figure.) Humor and lighthearted play are as common as ferocity. 
Stories from the Zen lore naturally abound. One frequently painted 
figure is Bodhidharma _ Daruma, in Japanese _ the first patriarch 
of Zen, who is said to have brought Buddhism from India to China in 
the sixth century A.D. The master Gentatsu Yuzen _ who presided over 
a small rural temple during a period when Buddhism was being persecuted 
in the mid-19th century and nearly obliterated by the state-supported 
advocates of the Shinto religion _ painted Daruma as a wistful, brooding, 
mournful Kojak look-alike. His successor, Mokurai Takeda, in a more 
buoyant era, indicated Daruma's strong shoulders with a single heavy 
ink stroke, into which the patriarch's pale, bald head seems to sink 
like a stone, presumably from the weight of his nine years of unbroken 
zazen (meditation) before a wall in a Shaolin temple in China. Even 
when appearing realistic, Zen calligraphy verges on the not-there. 
The nearly blind Zen master Gempo Sohan created a ``One Stroke Daruma'': 
The master meditator is sketched in a dashingly bare line that coils 
back on itself like a snail shell. Lacking head or limbs, Daruma has 
become nothing but his robe. After so many years facing the wall, 
``he'' is no longer there. Summing up the Zen brush, Yuzen wrote, 
``To make a painting requires a lot of zazen.'' The same spirit helps 
in appreciating it. Knowing the meaning of characters is not really 
necessary. Intellectual understanding is not important in Zen. It 
may even get you whacked with the kyosaku (the training stick). It 
is better, perhaps, to recall a poem addressed to Zen archers: The 
enemy is yourself. The target is your own ego. One shot. One life. 
Self-centered people will never hit the mark. The spirit of the Zen 
brush involves embracing contradiction: just the pure intensity of 
being ``mountain'' and immovable, yet moving lightly _ and as fiercely 
as lightning.
