It is time now for sports with VOA's Steve Shine. Thank you very much, 
Tony. Slugger Juan Gonzalez, of baseball's Texas Rangers has been 
voted the American League's Most Valuable Player for the second time. 
The outfielder received 21 of the 28 first place votes by the Baseball 
Writer's Association of America. Boston shortstop, Nomar Garcia Farrell, 
was second, followed by shortstop, Derek Geter of the New York Yankees. 
The 29 year-old Gonzalez helped lead the Rangers to the American League 
West title with a 318 batting average and 45 home runs. He had a league 
leading 157 runs batted in which is the highest American League total 
since 1949. Two years ago, Gonzalez edged Seattle Mariner shortstop, 
Alex Rodgriguez, to win that MVP award. The National league Most Valuable 
Player will be announced on Thursday.
