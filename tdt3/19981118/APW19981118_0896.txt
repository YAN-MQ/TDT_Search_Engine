When U.N. weapons inspectors went back to work Wednesday, it was so 
normal it seemed as if the last two weeks of high tension never happened. 
The six white vehicles from the U.N. Special Commission investigating 
Iraq's hidden arms pulled out of UNSCOM's headquarters on Baghdad's 
eastern edge. Accompanying them were a half dozen cars full of Iraqi 
escorts _ a sign that Iraq was cooperating. The weapons inspectors 
would not talk to reporters and TV crews, as usual. And their spokeswoman, 
Caroline Cross, would not say where the inspectors were going or what 
tasks they would perform. ``The Baghdad Monitoring and Verification 
Center has resumed full-range activities,'' was her succinct _ and 
bureaucratic _ announcement of the return to work. In fact, the inspectors 
went back to the job only after the United States and Britain threatened 
air strikes against Iraq unless it removed its restrictions on the 
inspectors. Iraq backed down Saturday as air and missile attacks were 
about to be unleashed. On Wednesday, the first evidence came that 
Iraq was cooperating as promised in its Saturday statement. It provided 
the escorts necessary under Iraq-U.N. agreements; in the past it has 
denied escorts to block inspections. In New York, Ewen Buchanan, a 
spokesman at U.N. headquarters for the weapons inspectors, told The 
Associated Press in a phone call from Baghdad that teams went out 
``on routine inspection.'' He said: ``They did not report any problems.'' 
Buchanan declined to give any details on how many inspectors went 
into the field, where they went or when they returned. Asked about 
his expectations for Iraqi cooperation in the future, he said, ``We 
will wait and see.'' The inspectors were expected to limit their first 
visits to sites where they have installed cameras and sensors for 
long-term monitoring.
