That's "Dollars & Sense." Back to you, Catherine. Thanks, Myron. We'll 
have the latest sports news and highlights up next in "CNN Headline 
Sports." The Coliseum area in the early '90s was dilapidated buildings, 
overgrown lots... and basically it wasn't an area you would want to 
be caught in. Oh, now, they can't believe that it's the same area. 
When people come in they say, "where did these houses come from?" 
"Is this the same neighborhood?" Homeownership is the main ingredient. 
When you own your own home, it gives you a feeling you belong. You 
stand for something. We look at the neighborhood and we look at the 
house and we feel like we've accomplished something. The Fannie Mae 
foundation. If you could accompany your data on its trip overseas 
the experience would be alarming. Local carriers handing it to national 
carriers over to cable carriers... till you don't know who has your 
data. Unless you send it through here. With the one and only company 
that owns the entire network-- local, national, and international. 
So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Matt Yallof, 
"CNN Headline Sports."
