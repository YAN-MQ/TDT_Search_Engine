This is VOA News Now, I coming to you from Washington. I am Erin Brummet 
with Tony Riggs. As Pacific Rim leaders ended their summit today in 
Malaysia, they issued a wide-ranging declaration built on the theme 
of economic recovery. For details of that declaration, we return to 
Amy Vickers in Kuala Lumpur. In the closing declaration of this year's 
APEX Summit, the 21 leaders present a united front on the singular 
importance of combating the economic crisis. And reaffirm their view 
that prospects for recovery are strong. While Malaysia, the United 
States, and other nations have conflicting opinions on how to manage 
cross-border financial flows, currency trading, and fancy investment 
vehicles, like hedge funds, the communique tries to bridge the gap. 
But outlines a number of steps meant to draw sustainable investment 
flows back to Asia. The document makes clear the leaders' view that 
so-called hot money which flows quickly and unpredictably, is not 
desirable. The leaders say some countries have already made substantial 
progress. Highlighting reform programs undertaken in Indonesia, Korea, 
the Philippines, and Thailand. In a post summit briefing with reporters, 
Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahah Termuhammed, said he is optimistic 
that Asia would become an attractive investment destination once again. 
A lot of people feel that things have stabilized somewhat. And most 
of the Asian governments are now aware of their own weaknesses. And 
have undertaken to correct those weaknesses. So because of that, I 
think investors will feel much more confident to come into the Asia 
vestment meeting. But there is no denying that financial problems 
continue to plague countless Asian companies. With many already technically 
bankrupt. To that end, the leaders endorsed the $10 billion aid and 
loans package unveiled by the United States and Japan. The pack pledges 
to help rebuild the private sector, with the help of the World Bank 
and the Asian Development Bank. They also praised Japan's $30 billion 
Meyasawa Plan to support economic recovery in the region. The declaration 
also calls for APEX states to establish networks and partnerships 
to better use technology and science. And it underscores the importance 
of career training and human resource development. But the emphasis 
this year is clearly on pushing Asia out of recession and setting 
up protective mechanisms like precautionary credit lines and better 
risk analysis. To avert or at least diminish, future financial crises.
