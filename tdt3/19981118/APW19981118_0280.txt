SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ LG Chemical Ltd. said Wednesday it has signed 
a deal to sell its two carbon black plants in South Korea to Degussa 
AG of Germany for dlrs 170 million. Carbon black is used in the manufacture 
of tires, ink and paint. LG's two plants produced 213,000 tons of 
the material last year, making a profit of dlrs 7.1 million on sales 
of dlrs 85.2 million. LG said the sale is part of its efforts to concentrate 
on core products such as polycarbonate, a plastic material used in 
compact discs, mobile phones and car interiors, and photoresist, which 
is used in semiconductors. Degussa AG is the world's second largest 
carbon black manufacturer. LG Chemical, a unit of South Korean conglomerate 
LG, is the country's largest chemical company, with dlrs 4 billion 
in 1997 sales.
