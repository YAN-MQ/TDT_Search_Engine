Today marks a macabre anniversary -- the mass suicide 20 years ago 
in guyana of more than 900 followers of the Reverend Jim Jones. A 
memorial service last night in San Francisco remembered Jones' disciples. 
They had gone to that south American country to create a utopian community. 
On Jones' orders, U.S. congressman Leo Ryan and several journalists 
who had come to investigate the cult were ambushed and killed. Jones 
then ordered his followers, including children, to drink a punch laced 
with cyanide. A congressional investigation ruled out suspected CIA 
involvement. But more than 5,000 pages of the report remain secret.
