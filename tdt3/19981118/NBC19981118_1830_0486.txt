Five days after a close brush with a massive bombing attack, Iraqi 
officials today let United Nations weapons inspectors get back to 
work. On the surface, it looks like business as usual. But as NBC's 
Jim Miklaszewski tells us, it appears a lot of things may have changed 
since the inspectors were last there. Nearly three weeks after Saddam 
Hussein shut them down, U.N. weapons inspectors encountered no problems 
today, as they set out to resume their search for Iraq's deadly weapons. 
The U.S. has threatened to attack without warning if Iraq interferes, 
but intelligence sources tell NBC news that in the past few weeks, 
Saddam stepped up his shell game, moving weapons material to new hiding 
places that could take inspectors weeks, or perhaps months to track 
down. They need to redevelop their intelligence network, find out 
where Saddam's hiding things now. Instead, U.N. inspectors will launch 
an immediate challenge by demanding weapons records and documents 
they know to exist. NBC news has learned that inspectors specifically 
want and one document that apparently shows Saddam was using part 
of the U.N. oil-for-food program, not for Iraqis, but to buy spare 
parts and produce fuel for his missile program. But a senior U.S. 
official tells NBC news that even if Iraq refuses to turn over documents, 
that's not enough to start a war. That puts pressure on U.N. inspectors 
to either find Saddam's weapons or force a quick confrontation. The 
Burden is now on the inspectors to turn out the proof. The Burden 
should have been on Saddam. And tonight, two more U.S. warships armed 
with cruise missiles are headed toward the gulf to back up U.N. inspectors. 
And Pentagon sources report President Clinton will let inspections 
play out for about six weeks and then decide whether to force another 
showdown with saddam or simply call off the troops, Tom? Thanks, very 
much. Jim Miklaszewski at the Pentagon tonight.
