President Clinton is on his way to Asia with hopes of reviving economies 
there. His first stop, Japan. Mr. Clinton says nothing is more important 
to restoring stability in the region than restoring the Japanese economy. 
And he says the United States can help do that. The president's five-day 
trip comes on the heels of an Asia-pacific economic summit. Vice President 
Gore attended in place of Mr. Clinton, who was delayed because of 
the Iraq crisis.
