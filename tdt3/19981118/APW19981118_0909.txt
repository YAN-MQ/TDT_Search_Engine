Unemployment in Russia has reached 11.5 percent, with 8.4 million 
people out of jobs, according to estimates by the State Statistics 
Committee released Wednesday. That is a 4.7 percent increase since 
October, the committee said. The official unemployment rate is only 
2.5 percent, or 1.8 million people, the committee said, according 
to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Many Russians do not register as unemployed, 
often because they don't want to waste time on the procedure for the 
sake of negligible benefits. The statistics committee apparently included 
these people in the larger estimate. Many of those who are officially 
employed are in fact also out of work, as idle factories and troubled 
companies send scores of employees on forced vacations.
