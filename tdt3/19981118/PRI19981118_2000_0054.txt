From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. 
At tomorrow's impeachment hearing, independent council Kenneth Starr 
plans to tell the House Judiciary Committee that Bill Clinton misused 
his authority and power as president. NPR's Barbara Bradley has more. 
The allegations are familiar. In prepared remarks, Starr says, "The 
President made a series of pre-meditated false statements under oath 
when he gave his deposition to Paula Jones' lawyers on January 17th." 
Starr also says that Mr. Clinton misled the trial judge in that case 
when he failed to correct his lawyer's statement that the President 
had never had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinski. According 
to the independent counsel, the president then used his cabinet as 
"unwitting surrogates to support his lies, by denying the relationship. 
So that his aids would mislead the grand jury." Starr will speak for 
two hours on Thursday, and then be questioned by lawyers and committee 
members. Democrats say their time will be so limited that any cross-examination 
will be ineffective. Barbara Bradley, NPR News, Washington.
