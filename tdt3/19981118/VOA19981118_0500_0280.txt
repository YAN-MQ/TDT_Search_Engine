Amnesty International says thousands of American children in juvenile 
detention centers suffer human right violations. Amnesty says in a 
report that 38 states house juvenile offenders in adult facilities 
where children are denied education and are more likely to be beaten 
by staff or sexually assaulted. The human rights group says most alarming 
are executions of people convicted of crimes committed as juveniles. 
There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Justice Department.
