to begin by the end of the month. ``We are starting today to negotiate 
the permanent agreement,'' Sharon told reporters. ``I think that we

Abu Mazen told reporters that he expected Israel to carry out its

complex. The final status negotiations are to deal with the question 
of borders and Palestinian demands for statehood in addition to refugees, 
water, Jewish settlements and the status of Jerusalem. The meeting:
