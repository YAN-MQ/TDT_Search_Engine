Sources tell CNN, sticking points on the Palestinian side include 
additional Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank. They also 
want an agreement on the release of Palestinian prisoners being held 
in Israeli prisons. The Israelis want the Palestinians to provide 
greater security against terrorist attacks. They also want a change 
in the Palestinian charter which calls for the destruction of Israel 
and an agreement on the extradition of terrorists suspects from Palestinian 
areas.
