At first glance, it looked as if the Vatican was not thrilled when 
Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist who leads the largest leftist 
party in Italy, was asked to form a majority that would allow him 
to become the next prime minister. ``Fifty years after the hard-won 
victory of liberty and democracy over Communism,'' the Vatican newspaper 
Osservatore Romano warned on Sunday, ``the head of state has entrusted 
the task of forming a new government to an apparatchik of the former 
Communist Party.'' Leftist governments have been elected in Britain, 
France and Germany, making the selection of D'Alema appear part of 
a broader European trend. Yet if D'Alema, 49, succeeds in getting 
his government approved in Parliament, he would be the first former 
Communist to lead a major Western European country. Monday, he brokered 
a majority by nailing down alliances with a breakaway faction of Communists 
as well as a small center-right party that defected from the opposition. 
Italian readers could not be faulted for concluding that leaders of 
the Roman Catholic Church in Italy, who throughout the Cold War vehemently 
and openly campaigned against communist candidates, did not relish 
the precedent of a former Communist in power now any more than they 
did at any time in the last 50 years. On second glance, however, a 
more indirect strategy can also be detected in the church's reaction. 
D'Alema, who leads the Democratic Party of the Left and is relying 
on former Christian Democrats as well as Communists to beef up his 
center-left base, is destined to make some political compromises. 
The Catholic Church is still a powerful political constituency in 
Italy, and it does not intend to be left out of the horse-trading. 
``It took a Socialist government in Italy to make a concordat with 
the church,'' Vittorio Messori, a Catholic writer who interviewed 
Pope John Paul II in the book ``Crossing the Threshold of Hope,'' 
said, referring to the postwar period and the 1984 concordat that 
abolished Catholicism as the state religion, on terms that many view 
as favorable to the church. ``In 50 years the so-called Christian 
Democrats never dared pass anything favorable to the Catholic Church.'' 
Italy's law legalizing abortion was passed in 1978, when Giulio Andreotti, 
a strong Catholic, was prime minister. (He is now on trial on corruption 
charges and alleged Mafia links.) Messori said he expected that D'Alema 
could pass legislation that even his predecessor, Romano Prodi, a 
Catholic who was hemmed in by his leftist allies, did not risk. The 
church has been lobbying heavily for the government to give more state 
financing to private Catholic schools, something Prodi favored but 
was never able to get through Parliament. D'Alema, moreover, seems 
anxious not to alienate the Catholic Church. Asked at a news conference 
Monday night if he intended to use a scheduled meeting with the pope 
on Tuesday to clarify his relationship with the church, he evenly 
replied, ``I have no quarrel with the Holy Father, so I have nothing 
to clarify.'' The church, which helped keep the Christian Democrats 
in power for more than 50 years, adopted a more flexible approach 
to politics in 1992. By then, the Berlin wall had fallen, and so had 
the Christian Democratic Party, which collapsed under the weight of 
corruption scandals. During the 1996 elections, which brought Prodi 
to power, Vatican officials said the church would not endorse a particular 
party, though they urged Catholic voters to select candidates and 
parties who best defended the interests of the church. Now, faced 
with the prospect of D'Alema, Messori said many Catholics were counting 
on a pragmatic strategy by the church: ``As Machiavelli said, `If 
you want to further your own aims, put your enemies in power.'''
