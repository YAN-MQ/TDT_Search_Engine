Taiwan's chief negotiator has left China after a six day visit and 
talks with top leaders that were described by both sides as very warm 
and cordial. VOA's Roger Wilkison has details from our bureau in Beijing. 
Mr. Goo's visit appears to have broken the ice between the two rivals 
since China scraped formal talks three years ago, but China and Taiwan 
remain far apart on the key question of reunification. Beijing sees 
it as inevitable while Taiwan insists that China should become fully 
democratic before the two can reunite. The two sides are also in disagreement 
over Taiwan's status. Beijing says the island is a wayward province 
of China. Taiwan argues that it is a sovereign state. China's official 
news agency said Monday that cross-state relations will only improve 
if Taiwan takes steps towards reunification. But Mr. Goo made it plain 
throughout his visit to Shanghai and Beijing that neutral trust can 
only be built up over time and through continuous contacts. Polls 
show most Taiwanese want to maintain the island's status quo of defacto 
independence and postpone any decision on reunification. Roger Wilkison, 
VOA News, Beijing.
