Former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson will get another chance to regain 
his title. By a 4 to 1 vote the Nevada state boxing commission returned 
his boxing license today. Tyson lost his right to fight last year 
when he bit off a portion of evander Holyfield's ear during a match. 
Doctors released a report last week concluding Tyson would probably 
behave if he was allowed to step back in the ring. For some of his 
fans, this may be his last chance for redemption. Mike embarrassed 
all of you, he embarrassed myself. He embarrassed a whole boxing community. 
And I talked to him at length about that. He embarrassed one of his 
heroes and that's Mohammad Ali. He embarrassed the game that he loves 
so, so much. And I told Mike, and I'll tell you as well, I will not 
get involved with mike unless he comes back and comes back right. 
Tyson could now get his first bout as early as December.
