An explosion at a crowded bus station in the southern Israeli town 
of Bereshaba has wounded at least 45 people, including more than 20 
Israeli soldiers. Witness and radio accounts say a man threw two hand 
grenades at a crowd in a bus station during the morning rush hour. 
Authorities say the man is a Palestinian who may have been acting 
on his own, possibly with the intent of harming the soldiers.
