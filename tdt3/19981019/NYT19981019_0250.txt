Having endured arctic storms, dangerous fissures in the ice pack, 
polar-bear intrusions and a year of crushing pressure while frozen 
into a drifting floe, the Canadian icebreaker Des Groseilliers reached 
Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, on Saturday. Aboard it was a rich cargo of data 
expected to reveal subtle mechanisms that drive changes in the world's 
climate. The ship's arrival marked the end of a yearlong round of 
experiments paid for mostly by the National Science Foundation, with 
support from the Office of Naval Research and the Japanese government. 
The $19.5-million project, called ``SHEBA,'' for Surface Heat Budget 
of the Arctic Ocean, was a detailed measurement of heat flow among 
the water, ice and air of the high Arctic, and the results are expected 
to improve the mathematical modeling of global climate change. SHEBA, 
administered by the University of Washington, was the largest and 
most complex project ever supported in the Arctic by the National 
Science Foundation. In a telephone call from the ship, Dr. Richard 
Moritz of the University of Washington, director of the project, said 
the atmospheric, oceanic and geophysical scientists who spent part 
of the year aboard the floating laboratory, would spend the next several 
months compacting and analyzing the data collected by thousands of 
sensors on and around the ship. The investigators will meet in Tucson, 
Ariz., at the end of January to begin consolidating their findings, 
he said. Some preliminary results include indications that the entire 
year was markedly warmer than past years. The ocean remained open 
much farther north than normal, and the ice began breaking up sooner 
than normal in the spring. Moreover, the salinity of ocean surface 
water was low, showing that the water was mixed with an unusually 
large proportion of fresh water from melting ice. Moritz said the 
warming trend may have been mainly the result of the recent El Nino 
climate event in the Pacific Ocean, but could also reflect a global-warming 
trend. Dr. Donald Perovich, SHEBA's chief scientist on loan from the 
Army's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, in Hanover, 
N.H., said the research year had been eventful. ``We had a real scare 
during the winter when our headquarters floe started to break up,'' 
he said. ``One of our ice camps near the ship broke away and drifted 
a half-mile from the ship in less than an hour.'' From the point at 
which the ship was intentionally embedded in ice 320 miles north of 
the coastal village of Dead Horse, Alaska, it drifted about 1,800 
miles before its powerful engines were started and the vessel headed 
for land. ``Toward the end of the summer,'' Perovich said, ``the ice 
had melted so much that thin patches barely covered the water.'' ``Scientists 
were constantly falling through into the nearly freezing water _ 11,000 
feet deep _ so everyone took to wearing flotation devices while working,'' 
he said. ``Sometimes we had polar bear visits. Once, a mama bear was 
instructing her cub how to floss its teeth with a cable strung out 
to one of our sensors, and we had to chase them away with a tractor. 
``But it was a wonderful project.''
