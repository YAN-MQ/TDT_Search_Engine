In Texas, at least 14 people are dead after a weekend of violent storms. 
Some areas have already received more than 20 inches of rain. Texas 
governor George W. bush was scheduled to take an aerial tour of the 
damaged areas this afternoon, and President Clinton has promised federal 
aid. Water levels on some rivers in the southern part of the state 
are still rising. Eric horng reports. Parts of southeast Texas remain 
under water after heavy rains cut a 200-mile swath of watery devastation. 
This is the wettest month San Antonio has ever recorded. From the 
air, parts of town look like swampland. On the ground, rescue boats 
cruise through snake-infested waters, moving people to higher ground. 
Since Saturday, more than 400 people in the San Antonio area alone 
have been rescued from their vehicles. Oh, we're hurting now, fellas. 
And even some of those doing the rescuing have had to call for help 
as well. Everybody, get on top of the truck. They hopefully will send 
out either another truck, yeah, they got the grater coming out to 
get us. 90 miles away, near Austin, streets have all but disappeared, 
swallowed by nearby creeks and rivers. You see that fence over there, 
how tall it is? We just went over a fence just like that right here. 
But people aren't the only ones affected by the floods. In Bastrop 
county, a horse struggles to stay afloat. Rescuers speed to the scene 
to save the animal, which is caught on a Submerged fence. And in comal 
county, a TV news helicopter captures a bizarre sight -- a cow perched 
atop the roof of a house. But there's very little people here haven't 
seen. Their bodies and spirits soaked by rains that forecasters say 
will likely continue for at least one more day. Eric horng, "Headline 
News."
