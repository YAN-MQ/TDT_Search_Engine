It's been a good month for blasphemy. ``Corpus Christi,'' playwright 
Terence McNally's retelling of the story of Jesus with a gay savior 
and disciples, has sold out its New York run despite furious picketers 
and dismissive reviews. Portuguese author Jose Saramago was awarded 
the Nobel Prize for Literature despite the offense caused by his 1992 
novel ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' presenting a lustful 
Jesus used as a pawn in God's plan to expand his influence. And Salman 
Rushdie was finally freed, more or less, from the death sentence imposed 
by Iran's mullahs nine years ago for insulting the Koran in ``The 
Satanic Verses.'' The list of works deemed sacrilegious goes on and 
on, from Andres Serrano's notorious crucifix in a jar of urine to 
Martin Scorsese's 1988 film ``The Last Temptation of Christ.'' And 
the ecclesiastical mud fights they seem to spawn with monotonous regularity, 
regardless of their quality, are a revealing window on the convoluted 
politics of impiety in art. The experience of ``Corpus Christi'' in 
particular offers at least two lessons. The first is that when it 
comes to religion, controversy _ even recycled controversy _ still 
sells. The second is that sometimes your friends can never do as much 
for you as your enemies can. ``I think sometimes authors must hope 
and pray someone will condemn their work, because it's the greatest 
thing that could happen to it,'' said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor 
of America, a magazine published by the Jesuit order. ``It's like 
the old `Banned in Boston' ad for pornographic films.'' ``Corpus Christi'' 
was canceled and then reinstated by the Manhattan Theater Club last 
summer after the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights condemned 
it and the theater received death threats. The Catholic League and 
others said they objected to both the play's content and what they 
saw as a continuing double standard. They say that in artistic expression 
there are protected groups (blacks, Jews, gays) about whom anything 
remotely offensive rarely sees the light of day, while others (Christians, 
WASPs, lower-class whites) are considered fair game for abuse. When 
the furor over ``Corpus Christi'' erupted last summer, columnist Patrick 
J. Buchanan termed it ``nothing less than a hate crime of modernity 
directed against Christians, the moral equivalent of Nazis marching 
through Skokie.'' William Donahue of the Catholic League said, ``The 
need to offend Catholics is so deep and so sick it can only be described 
as pathological.'' Given the liberal leanings of many dramatists and 
other artists and those who sponsor them, the charge of a double standard 
is not without merit. It's hard to imagine, for example, jokes about 
poor whites stirring quite the same outrage as virtually identical 
ones about poor blacks. And while it's conceivable that Saramago could 
have won the Nobel if he were a gay-bashing fascist instead of a committed 
communist critical of the Catholic Church, it doesn't seem likely. 
But the double-standard argument only goes so far, as some Catholic 
intellectuals concede. There are far uglier things than negative portrayals, 
as was made clear last week when a gay college student in Wyoming 
died after being kidnapped, robbed, pistol-whipped and left tied to 
a fence. ``There is some anti-Catholic sentiment that runs deep in 
the culture, but you don't see Catholics being targets of violence,'' 
said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit deacon and associate editor of 
America. ``You can't compare it to virulent racism or anti-Semitism. 
I think it trivializes your argument when you try to put everyone 
on the same level.'' Martin added that the notion of Christians as 
a free-strike zone in art and popular culture is an outdated one at 
a time when fundamentalist organizations and groups like Donahue's 
now play the game of victimhood with all the zeal of other special 
interests. ``The problem with the Catholic League is that they cry 
wolf too frequently,'' he said. ``I don't think every criticism of 
the church is de facto anti-Catholicism.'' The deeper and more complicated 
issue is what is fair and what goes over the line in dealing with 
religious themes. There is no more resonant story in the Western world 
than that of Jesus' life, so it inspires many retellings, with the 
Jesus figure being appropriated by Latinos, blacks, gays _ you name 
it. The ultimate tribute to the power of the story is that so many 
groups want to reinterpret it 2,000 years later. On the other hand, 
that makes the story of Jesus a target for cheap shots and tiresome, 
ritualistic debates like the one over ``Corpus Christi.'' Indeed, 
when the play opened, the general critical reaction was not that it 
was so offensive but that it was so lame. The Philadelphia Inquirer 
dismissed it as ``a terrible play, a hopeless jumble of juvenile humor 
and mawkish sentimentality.'' Nonetheless, ``Corpus Christi'' has 
sold lots of tickets, no doubt a side effect if not an aim of all 
the controversy. Which perhaps offers a final lesson about raising 
such a ruckus before the first curtain rises: It probably makes sense 
to see a play before waging a holy war against it.
