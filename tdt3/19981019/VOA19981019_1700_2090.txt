British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook says the international community 
will continue to press Yugoslavia to honor its pledge to end violence 
in Serbia's Kosovo province. The minister said the international community 
will continue pressure until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
withdraws his forces and halts repression and until the people of 
Kosovo can safely return home. The British minister also condemned 
ethnic Albanian guerrillas for the deaths of three Serbian police 
officers in recent days.
