Wall Street opens for business today after being buoyed by a surprise 
interest rate cut on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial average gained 
117 points Friday to 8,417, ending the week with the biggest point 
gain in five sessions at 517. According to Steven Roche, Chief Economist 
and Director of Global Economic Analysis at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 
the Central Bank's move to cut the interest rate Thursday averted 
a potential recession. It was an extraordinary move aimed at alleviating 
the potential pressures of a credit crunch which could have led to 
a recession in the United States in 1999 and the worst recession in 
the global economy since the 1930s. The risk of that has been lowered 
dramatically by the Feds action.
