Iraqi officials lashed out at U.N. arms monitors Monday, saying that 
they act unprofessionally and in one case turned on music and danced 
as they examined a missile production site. Iraq repeatedly has accused 
U.N. weapons inspectors of espionage and on Aug. 5 ordered an end 
to surprise inspections by the arms experts, effectively banning all 
searches for elements of its past weapons programs. Iraq has recently 
mounted a campaign to discredit the remaining inspectors, who are 
only allowed to visit weapons sites where the United Nations already 
has installed surveillance equipment. One Iraqi official, Kahlil Hameed, 
accused the monitors of turning on cassette recorders and dancing 
in August while examining a missile site. Hammed also said monitors 
used their personal cameras to take photographs of civilians, passing 
cars and visitors to the missile production site that he administers. 
Iraqi authorities arranged the interview with Hameed to back up accusations 
by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that the inspectors engaged in 
espionage. Aziz made that claim in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan released Saturday. In New York, a spokesman for the U.N. 
inspectors dismissed the Iraqi allegations. The monitors ``are a group 
of people who are, by and large, good professionals doing a difficult 
job under pressure,'' said Ewen Buchanan. Sudat Mohammed, 8th graf
