This is Dennis Michael with the "Hollywood Minute." Steven Spielberg 
has changed the schedule for his next project, "memoirs of a geisha." 
The film was to begin shooting in January, but now the cameras roll 
in april. "Daily variety" reports sources close to the project speculate 
that it might be a good idea for the director of "saving private Ryan" 
to be in Los angeles, rather than on location, during Oscar season.
