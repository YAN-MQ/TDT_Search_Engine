The former military chief of Angola's UNITA Rebel Movement has died 
in a hospital in South Africa and UNITA alleges he was poisoned. A 
spokeswoman at the Pretoria Hospital says 42 year old General Arlindo 
Chenda Pena died Monday, two days after being admitted with a bad 
case of malaria. But the UNITA Movement released a statement saying 
the general was poisoned by the Angolan government and a splinter 
UNITA group. The Angola government denies the charge.
