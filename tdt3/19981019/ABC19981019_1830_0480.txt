In the Middle East today, more than 60 Israelis were injured when 
a man threw two hand grenades into a crowd at a bus stop in beersheba. 
Many of the injured were soldiers. The Israelis say the man they captured 
is a Palestinian. A spokesman for the Palestinian group Hamas said 
it's the kind of thing that will continue until the Israelis end their 
occupation of Palestinian land. It is exactly the kind of thing which 
jeopardizes the Israeli Palestinian peace process being negotiated 
under president leadership here. Are these talks going well or badly? 
Both sides think an agreement is in their interest. However, that 
grenade attack certainly complicates matters. It makes it more difficult 
and the outcome far less certain. Earlier today, President Clinton 
flew back to Maryland's eastern shore to the plantation conference 
center where the negotiations are being held. At this moment he's 
in a flee-way meeting with prime minister Netanyahu and palestinian 
leader Arafat. Earlier today, the Israelis said they would not discuss 
anything at the moment except security issues because of the grenade 
attack. Presumably, the three of them are discussing security issues. 
Sam Donaldson at the White House this evening on the Middle East peace 
talks in Maryland which have been fairly secret for most of the time.
