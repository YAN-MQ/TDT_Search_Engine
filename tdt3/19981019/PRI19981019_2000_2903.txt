More news still ahead on the World on PRI. That's Public Radio International. 
The World is made possible in part by Merck, a research-driven pharmaceutical 
company discovering, developing, and manufacturing a broad range of 
human and animal health products and services. Merck, committed to 
bringing out the best in medicine. And the World is brought to you 
by the Capital Group, investing throughout the world for individuals 
and institutions. If you travel, you know that uneasy feeling that 
can come when you arrive in a strange city and you haven't booked 
a room. You're not exactly homeless but you can't relax until you've 
safely stowed your bags. I'm Lisa Mullins, asking you to settle in, 
make yourself at home and considering making this station one of those 
places you return to again and again. Your membership in public radio 
implies that you're more than a tourist. You're a regular here. Please 
call now and support the station's fundraising effort. Your contribution 
helps ensure that this program in particular will still be here the 
next time you visit. The number to call to make your pledge is 215 
923-1234. Call collect if it's long distance, 215 923-1234. Make a 
pledge of $60 or perhaps $120, maybe even $180 now at 215 923-1234. 
Thanks for your support.
