This look at your "Headline News weather" begins with our forecast 
for high temperatures on Tuesday. A very cool day in the upper midwest 
and parts of the Rockies and plains states with highs only in the 
40s. A large area will see highs only in the 50s. This very cool air 
has been ushered in by a very strong cold front. As you look at our 
forecast weather map, you can see that frontal system. It's the same 
front that's been bringing the torrential rainfall into south texas. 
It doesn't move very much over the next 24 hours. So widely scattered 
showers are expected to continue in the lone star state. As we move 
ahead and take a look at your extended forecast. On Wednesday, showers 
in the Great Lakes area and parts of the southwest, too. You can see 
the very cool temperatures on the map. We move ahead into Thursday, 
you can see still showers in the southwest. The cool weather in the 
east begins to moderate somewhat. And as we jump ahead to Friday, 
you can see we're looking at dry weather for most of the nation. Cool 
in the east. It begins to warm a bit in the west. For more weather
