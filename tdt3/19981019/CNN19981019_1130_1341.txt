Week seven of the NFL comes to a close when the jets travel to Foxboro 
to take on the Patriots. Vinny Testaverde will start as quarterback. 
He's led New York to their only two wins of the season. In case you 
missed it -- the 49ers pulled out a 34-31 win over the Colts. Wade 
richey's 24-yard field goal with five seconds left capped the 49ers 
17-point, fourth quarter rally. On a busted play that turned into 
a one yard bootleg for Doug Flutie, the bills stun the previously 
unbeaten jaguars, 17-16. Anthony Keith James, "Headline Sports."
