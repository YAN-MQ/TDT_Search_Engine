South Korea's Hyundai Motor Company has been awarded the bid to take 
over troubled KIA Motors and its sister firm, Asia Motors, which collapsed 
last year. Ford Motor Company, the only foreign bidder and a major 
KIA shareholder, was disqualified because its bid price for Asia Motors 
was below the company's face value. Jonathan Dutton of Warberg, Gillan 
& Sole says Ford was never interested in acquiring both companies. 
They have proposed what they believe is a realistic level of debt 
write-off and secondly, the auction was for both KIA and Asia together. 
Ford did not want to take over Asia Motors, so they didn't bid for 
it and that's one of the reasons why the bid failed. KIA's creditors 
must approve Hyundai's bid before it goes through. KIA's collapsed 
heralded South Korea's worse recession since the Korean War.
