Paul McCartney says it was his late wife Linda, who kept him going 
after the Beatles split up. McCartney told "the London mail" he felt 
completely useless after the break-up in 1970. He and Linda went to 
a farm in Scotland where she taught him how to ride horseback. McCartney 
says the experience helped him get it back together. Linda McCartney 
died of breast cancer in April.
