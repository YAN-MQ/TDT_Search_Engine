Trevor Jones has been delivering milk since 1949 and sees no reason 
to disrupt his schedule now _ even if it is to meet the queen. The 
Welshman has turned down the chance to visit Buckingham Palace next 
month to receive an MBE, or Member of the Order of British Empire 
honor, from Queen Elizabeth II. ''I would end up rushing the day before 
to get everything done, then rushing up to London by 10 in the morning 
for the ceremony. The queen is a very nice lady, but she isn't worth 
rushing for. I'm sure she will understand,'' said Jones, 69. Instead, 
Jones will be given the MBE in a ceremony at Ebbw Vale civic center 
next month, which is closer to his home in Tredegar, south Wales. 
His wife Dorothy, 73, daughter Jane and six-week-old grandson Daniel 
will be with him. The queen's lord lieutenant, Sir Richard Hanbury 
Tennison, will conduct the honors. ``I know I am passing up the moment 
of a lifetime and I hope the queen will not mind,'' Jones said. ``But 
it would disrupt my deliveries and I have to put my customers first.'' 
The queen bestows the honors on the recommendation of the prime minister. 
Tony Blair's Labor government has made an effort to recognize more 
ordinary people. But Jones will still join an exclusive group that 
already includes Peter Cattaneo, director of the hit movie ''The Fully 
Monty'' and jazz singer Carol Kidd. Jones began his career when he 
was six years old and helped his father deliver milk in a horse-pulled 
cart. After serving in the army in Cyprus and North Africa, Jones 
returned to Wales and took up the route in 1949 delivering milk to 
hundreds. ``Trevor is a real local character,'' said Paul Hopkins, 
the mayor of Tredegar. ''He fully deserves his award - and I hope 
the whole town turns out to see him get it.''
