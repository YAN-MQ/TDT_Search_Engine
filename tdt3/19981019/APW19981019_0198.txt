OSTRAVA, Czech Republic (AP) - Russian junior Marat Safin crushed 
top-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-2 Monday in the 
first round of the dlrs 1 million IPB Czech Indoor tennis tournament. 
Korda started the match with several unforced errors and soon lost 
his serve to the 18-year-old Russian. Safin gained a 3-1 lead and 
comfortably won the first set, capitalizing on his powerful serve 
and clever play on the net. Safin waisted no time with Korda in the 
second set, beating him in less than 30 minutes. The Australian Open 
Champion, who is 9th in ATP rankings this year, lost his third consecutive 
first-round match in an ATP event and has now little chance to qualify 
for the ATP World Championship in Hannover. In a match of poweful 
baseliners, seventh-seed Thomas Enquist of Sweden had the stronger 
nerves and better concentration to outplay doubles specialist Paul 
Haarhuis of the Netherlands 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 after almost two hours. 
Also Monday, eighth-seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat Australian 
Andrew Ilie 6-4, 6-4, France's Guillaume Raoux defeated Mikael Tillstroem 
of Sweden 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), home-crowd favorite Jiri Novak rallied 
to beat wild card holder Nicolas Kiefer of Germany 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 
7-6 (7-2) and Wayne Black of Zimbabwe overpowered Radek Stepanek of 
the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-3. The tournament's favorite, second seed 
Andre Agassi of the United States, is scheduled to play his first-round 
match against Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen Wednesday.
