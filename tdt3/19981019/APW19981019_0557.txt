Previously unknown artistic skills can suddenly blossom in individuals 
struck by a rare form of dementia, according to a U.S. researcher. 
Dr. Bruce Miller of the University of California at San Francisco 
reports in Tuesday's edition of the journal Neurology on five people 
who had a burst of artistry even as dementia began destroying their 
ability to talk and deal with other human beings. ``In each of the 
five cases we've documented, a period of exceptional creativity heralded 
the beginnings of a tragic disease and continued to flourish even 
as the patients began to lose their ability to use language,'' he 
said. The individuals suffered from a disease called frontotemporal 
dementia, which he said accounts for only about one in 10 cases of 
dementia. This form of disease tends to strike when people are in 
their 50s and may run in families, Miller reported. The disease affects 
an area of the brain that influences social behavior, causing loss 
of social skills, Miller said. As the patients developed their artistic 
outburst, they lost interest in others and tended to work on their 
own. ``The loss of social skills and inhibitions may have facilitated 
the art of our patients,'' Miller and his co-authors wrote in their 
paper. Miller commented there may be parallels with such artists as 
Vincent van Gogh and Francisco Goya, who worked independently, spurned 
social involvement and battled mental illness. But, the researchers 
concluded that while this form of dementia opens ``an unexpected window 
into the artistic process,'' the actual mechanism to enhance the artistry 
of the individuals ``remains a mystery.''
