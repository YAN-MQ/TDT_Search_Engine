The death toll from a massive gas pipeline fire has risen to 500 and 
health officials fear that number will grow as badly burned people 
die of their wounds. The victims were killed while collecting gasoline 
which had leaked from a damaged pipeline near the town of Warri. VOA's 
West Africa correspondent, John Pitman, has details. The death toll 
from Sunday's explosion is expected to continue rising as more burn 
victims die in hospitals near the blast site. Hospital officials in 
the town of Warri say hundreds more were wounded by the fire. Many 
of the victims were burned beyond recognition. The military administrator 
for the area says these bodies will be buried in a mass grave as soon 
as possible. Hundreds of villagers had gathered around a hole in a 
gasoline pipeline on Sunday, trying to collect some of the spilled 
fuel. There are still conflicting reports about what sparked the explosion. 
Some reports say a careless smoker with a lighted cigarette may have 
been responsible. Others say the spark came from a motorcycle's exhaust 
pipe. Nigeria's Petroleum Ministry says it believes the leak in the 
pipeline was caused by sabotage. John Pitman, VOA News, West Africa 
Bureau.
