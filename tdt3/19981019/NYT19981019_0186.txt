Now that a more potent version of Rogaine has joined Propecia on drugstore 
shelves, some 33 million American men who have been anxiously counting 
the hairs in their combs have more options. Here is how they measure 
up: How They Work PROPECIA: Propecia contains 1 mg of finasteride, 
a drug that has also been prescribed to treat men with enlarged prostates. 
It affects dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, the active form of the male 
hormone at the hair follicle that contributes to male pattern baldness. 
Merck, the drug's manufacturer, says that in studies, 83 percent of 
those taking Propecia maintained or increased their hair count in 
two years, while 72 percent of those who did not take the drug lost 
hair. ROGAINE EXTRA STRENGTH: Rogaine's new formula has been increased 
from a 2 percent to a 5 percent solution of minoxidil, a drug that 
has been used to lower blood pressure. Although scientists are not 
exactly sure how it works, minoxidil acts directly on the follicle 
to stimulate hair growth. Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Rogaine's maker, 
reports that in clinical studies 4 out of 5 users said the new product 
slowed or stopped hair loss. Taking It PROPECIA: Comes in the form 
of a pill which must be taken once a day. ROGAINE EXTRA STRENGTH: 
A liquid that is applied directly to the scalp twice a day using a 
dropper or spray. Monthly Cost PROPECIA: About $50. ROGAINE EXTRA 
STRENGTH: About $30. Side Effects PROPECIA: Can cause decreased semen 
volume but does not affect sperm count. Small numbers of men report 
a drop in libido. If a pregnant woman is exposed to the drug it may 
cause abnormalities of the genitalia of her male fetus. ROGAINE EXTRA 
STRENGTH: Can cause itching or dryness of the scalp. Bottom Line Dr. 
David Alkek, clinical professor of dermatology at the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, says, ``Our clinical 
impression is that men who take Propecia alone grow hair faster and 
more dramatically than those who take 5 percent Rogaine alone. But 
what works even better is taking both drugs. They work differently 
adding to each others' effectiveness.''
