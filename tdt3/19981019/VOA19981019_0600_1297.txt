The Buffalo Bills have ignored all the talk about Doug Flutie being 
too short to be a National Football League quarterback and they're 
pretty glad he did. The 1.75 meter Flutie stood tall Sunday as he 
threw for 228 yards and a touchdown. He then rolled into the end zone 
with 13 seconds left in the game to lead the Bills to a 17 to 16 upset 
of the previously undefeated Jacksonville Jaguars. That's sports. 
I'm Jim Stevenson.
