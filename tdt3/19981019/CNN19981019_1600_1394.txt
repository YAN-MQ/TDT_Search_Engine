I wish... come on, girl. I wish I had an elephant. An elephant. Who'd 
always play with me. Bye-bye. But wishes are like elephants. They're 
bigger than can be. O.K., maybe you can't give her everything her 
heart desires. But with the humongous purchase power of the visa platinum 
card, maybe you can. And besides, you never know what she'll want 
next. And who's making sure business has the latest technology? Like 
the Intel Pentium II xeon processor in a custom-built server. Plus 
a desktop and laptop. And who does all that one customer at a time? 
Gateway. So give us a call.
