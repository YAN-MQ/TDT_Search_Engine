Russian President Boris Yeltsin has postponed his meetings with senior 
leaders today to shake off the lingering effects of a cold. Mr. Yeltsin 
will spend the day recovering at his country home outside Moscow. 
His health is being described as entirely satisfactory and he is expected 
to return to work tomorrow. Mr. Yeltsin's latest illness forced him 
to stay home most of last week, after cutting short a state visit 
to Central Asia.
