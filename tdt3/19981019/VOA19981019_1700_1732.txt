Thank you, Tom. Time to talk about frequencies, though. If you're 
listening to us in Oceana or the Pacific, you can consider switching 
over right now to 9.075 megahertz short-wave which we're now broadcasting 
on from hours to 00:00 hour universal time. If you'd like us to mail 
you a VOA frequency schedule, just send us your name and address. 
Send that off to VOA News Now, Voice of America, Washington, D.C., 
20547, USA, or you can e-mail us. Our e-mail address is newsnow @ 
voa.gov, and in this case, newsnow is just one word. It's universal 
time and this is VOA News Now. President Clinton is working at the 
Mid East summit to win an Israeli/Palestinian agreement in the wake 
of an Arab grenade attack in Israel. The death toll from a massive 
gas pipeline fire in Nigeria rises to 500. On Dateline, Pamela Taylor 
looks at America's image as a defender of human rights. All of that 
and new findings on the unconscious roots of prejudice coming up in 
our next half hour of VOA News Now. First, the latest world news.
