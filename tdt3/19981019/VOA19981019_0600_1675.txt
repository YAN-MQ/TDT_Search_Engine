In Newcastle, Pennsylvania, Alma Jean Donnelly owns the ugliest couch 
in America and she's proud of that. Why not? Well, that could be because 
her sofa, covered in balding green velour, was the winner of an ugly 
couch contest sponsored by Sure-Fit Slipcover, Inc. of New York City. 
The couch is 21 years old. It beat 1,200 entries in the contest. Ms. 
Donnelly submitted a photograph of the couch when she entered. She 
wins $2,000 and a new slipcover for that ugly couch. Alma Jean Donnelly 
already knows what she plans to do with some of the prize money. She'll 
buy another new slipcover, this time for an ugly green chair that 
matches the ugly green couch. The chair is not only ugly -- she says 
it's also hard to get up out of once you sit down. At least the couch 
is comfortable. I can -- let that one go. I have to tell you, I've 
seen this sofa. Yes, I did. I saw this couch In a photograph on television 
the other day. Is it truly as ugly as -- It is very, very, very, very 
ugly. Balding green velour. Yes. Even mine's not that ugly.
