With more than half of last year's U.S. grain crops still filling 
storage silos and with the second biggest maize harvest in U.S. history 
on the way, a lot of farmers face a tough question. Where are they 
going to put all that new grain? Farmers who aren't sure of the answer 
can find help on the worldwide web at an Internet site developed and 
run by engineers at the University of Missouri. Ray Massey is a grain 
storage specialist with the University's commercial agriculture program. 
They enter into a database on the web and say, "I am looking for grain 
storage and this is where I'm located," or "I have a storage facility 
that I'd be willing to rent out." And it also has a lot of pages on 
how to engineer your facility so that it will maintain the quality 
of the grain. The University of Missouri Web site took its first calls 
in September and Mr. Massey says the traffic since then has been steady 
but light. He says most farmers are probably still too busy harvesting 
grain to deal with where they're going to store it.
