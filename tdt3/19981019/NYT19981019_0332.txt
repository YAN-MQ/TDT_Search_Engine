In the spring styles on European runways, it's all in the details. 
Although most designers used a light hand, they left almost nothing 
totally unadorned. So in the months to come shoppers can expect to 
find clothes trimmed with feathers, mirrors, shells, beads and flowers. 
Especially flowers. Fabric flowers were pinned to dresses and jackets. 
Flowers were embroidered, sometimes with beads, onto sweaters, filmy 
camisoles, shoes and handbags. And flower prints were everywhere, 
usually in the softest of pastels but in bright, bold manifestations 
at Gucci and Versace. Some form of glitter or beading appeared on 
day and evening wear, but it was generally just a tracing rather than 
a heavy overlay. There was also a run on tulle, which was layered 
over other fabrics to mute the colors or over sequins to dull their 
shine. Giorgio Armani even veiled his day clothes with tulle to achieve 
a soft-focus effect.
