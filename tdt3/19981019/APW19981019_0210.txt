The status Monday of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's deadline _ pushed 
back to Oct. 27 _ or face renewed threat of airstrikes for his crackdown 
in Kosovo: _ Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo: A new wave 
of violence over the weekend killed three Serb policemen and wounded 
two, and both sides claimed a series of attacks by the other that 
could not be independently confirmed. No fullscale fighting has occurred 
in a month, but the weekend violence brought more Serb army troops 
into central Kosovo on Monday. _ Withdraw forces and heavy armaments 
to levels before the crackdown began Feb. 28: NATO spy planes continued 
flying over Kosovo to check on the status of pullouts. NATO says more 
Serb troops and police remain in the province than are permitted. 
Troops based in Pristina who were deployed in central Kosovo on Sunday 
and Monday are allowed to be in the province. _ Start serious talks 
with ethnic Albanians on self-rule: No date for the start of talks 
has been announced. The two sides have been holding separate discussions 
with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill. _ Help refugees return to their 
homes: Some refugees have begun moving back to their villages but 
many remain wary of Serb police forces, some of whom were accused 
in massacres of civilians. _ Allowing unhindered work by humanitarian 
organizations: The U.N. refugee agency postponed two convoys Monday 
to assess the security situation after the weekend violence. It said 
it planned to send out the postponed convoys on Tuesday, along with 
two other scheduled convoys. _ Cooperating with the International 
War Crimes Tribunal: U.N. war crimes investigators have received Yugoslav 
visas and plan to return to Kosovo soon. _ Allowing 2,000 international 
monitors into Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping its word: 
An advance team for the monitors, to be overseen by the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, arrived Saturday. OSCE officials 
in Pristina said 25 team members were in the province as of midday 
Monday.
