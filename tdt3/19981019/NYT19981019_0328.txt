President Clinton struggled on Monday night to salvage stalled Middle 
East peace talks after a Palestinian grenade attack on Israeli civilians 
made success seem less likely, senior officials from all sides said. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his team, guided in 
large part by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, decided to use the grenade 
attack as the justification for a dramatic negotiating ploy, insisting 
the Israel would suspend negotiations on all issues except for security, 
officials said. The Israeli position, one official said, is designed 
to push Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat into ``the most specific 
commitments possible'' to fight terrorism, in particular the military 
wing of Hamas. The Israelis want Palestinian terrorism suspects to 
be extradited to Israel, specific members of the Palestinian security 
forces to be arrested and tried in Israel for terrorist acts, reductions 
in the number of Palestinian police and confiscation of unlicensed 
weapons. Clinton returned here for a unscheduled fifth day of meetings 
with Netanyahu, Arafat and scores of aides and experts. He met on 
Monday night with the two leaders, who had not met face-to-face since 
they had lunch together on Friday. The ailing King Hussein of Jordan 
flew to his Maryland home from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and was 
described as ``standing by'' to try to push the leaders toward a deal. 
Arafat also appealed by telephone to the Israeli president, Ezer Weizman, 
officials said, and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, was also 
in contact with both sides. Clinton, after an appeal to the leaders 
from the White House lawn to ``consider the consequences of failure 
and the benefits of progress,'' plunged back into the talks here, 
presiding over a 45-minute meeting of security officials and experts 
from the delegations. Clinton had a one-on-one meeting with Netanyahu 
of about half an hour, then a similar meeting with Arafat, before 
bringing the two leaders together on Monday evening. ``The president 
will then take stock and decide where we go from here,'' a senior 
American official said on Monday evening, suggesting that the talks 
are likely to go on into a sixth day on Tuesday. Clinton is scheduled 
to fly to California Tuesday and remain there on Wednesday, and his 
spokesman said that plan had not yet changed.
