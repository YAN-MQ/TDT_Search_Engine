Taking no chances after several lawmakers received threats, Dan Tichon, 
the speaker of Israel's parliament, said he's carrying a gun these 
days, and offered a parliamentary pistol to any member who wants one. 
Israel's Knesset opened its winter session Monday with new seats, 
a fresh coat of paint, a new digital timer aimed at keeping speeches 
short, and new lighting. But one traditional feature was missing _ 
the prime minister. Benjamin Netanyahu, who was supposed to open the 
new session with an address on Israel's political agenda, is in the 
United States for a Mideast summit meeting with Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat. The Knesset agreed to postpone Netanyahu's speech until 
Wednesday but with the sides far from concluding a peace deal, it 
was not clear when he would return to address the house. Tichon said 
Netanyahu's speech could only be delayed if all the parties agree, 
and one right-wing party already said it doesn't. Rehavam Zeevi, leader 
of the tiny Moledet faction, said Netanyahu should not have gone to 
the summit in the first place, and should come home immediately. Moledet 
favors removing Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, and opposes 
any Israeli land concessions. So Netanyahu might be in contempt of 
parliament if the Wye Plantation summit continues through Wednesday. 
When he returns, he could find an armed Knesset though lawmakers have 
yet to comment on Tichon's offer. Tichon, a member of Netanyahu's 
right-wing Likud party, said he carries a weapon because of increasing 
political tensions and threats against the lives of Knesset members. 
A left-wing member was recently assigned a bodyguard after his car 
was set afire, apparently by right-wing extremists. Three years ago, 
a right-wing Jew shot and killed Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
at a peace rally in Tel Aviv. Tichon offered a pistol from the Knesset 
armory to any member who feels the need to carry one, and added that 
members of parliament can practice their sharpshooting at the Knesset 
firing range. The Israeli speaker told the newspaper Yediot Aharonot 
that he is assigned a bodyguard when he travels abroad, but would 
rather he wasn't. In Israel, he said he would ``continue to carry 
a gun.'' Summer-long renovations left the Knesset with a new look, 
but many of the same sounds. The large digital clock failed to impress 
parliamentarians who spoke over the time limits anyway.
