Russian President Boris Yeltsin canceled meetings with senior leaders 
Monday because he is still recovering from a cold, a news report said. 
The president is feeling the lingering effects of a respiratory infection, 
but his health is ``satisfactory,'' said presidential spokesman Dmitry 
Yakushin, according to the Interfax news agency. Yeltsin had been 
scheduled to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Boris Pastukhov, 
the minister in charge of relations with the former Soviet republics. 
The president's latest illness forced him to cut short a visit to 
Central Asia last week, and he spent most of the week at a country 
residence outside Moscow. The president also has canceled a trip to 
Malaysia for a summit next month. According to Yeltsin's office, the 
president will return to work in the Kremlin on Tuesday, where he 
will meet with Primakov and other officials. Yeltsin has been plagued 
by recurring health problems in recent years. He had heart bypass 
surgery two years ago, and has made fewer and fewer public appearances 
since then. Each new ailment rekindles speculation about his fitness 
to govern. The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no serious 
health problems and will serve out the final two years of his term.
