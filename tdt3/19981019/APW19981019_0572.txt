Mike Tyson won the biggest split decision of his life. Now, with the 
help of a certain former basketball player, he could be back in the 
ring before the year ends. ``I'm just happy I won,'' Tyson said Monday 
after the Nevada Athletic Commission voted 4-1 Monday to return the 
license it revoked when he bit Evander Holyfield's ears 15 months 
ago. With Magic Johnson and Muhammad Ali backing him up, Tyson seemed 
near tears upon learning he would be allowed to return from his boxing 
exile. He promised to put his life in order as he prepares to return 
to the sport he loves and the heavyweight division he once terrorized. 
When he does, Johnson says he will replace the spiky-haired Don King 
as Tyson's new promoter and help guide the career and troubled personal 
life of the 32-year-old former heavyweight champion. ``I'll be the 
closest guy to him, making all the decisions,'' Johnson said. Other 
sources close to Tyson told The Associated Press, though, that Johnson's 
role might not be as big as he believes, and that adviser Shelly Finkel 
will help Tyson make most of his major decisions. ``Shelly is still 
the guy,'' said a source, who asked not to be identified. The first 
decision will be when Tyson fights again. He could box at a Las Vegas 
casino as early as Dec. 5, although Johnson said it will not be against 
a top opponent. ``We're going to be bringing Mike along very slowly,'' 
Johnson said. ``Don't be looking for him to be fighting these champions.'' 
It was a contrite and thoroughly humbled Tyson who appeared before 
the commission Monday in a repeat of a hearing a month ago that went 
on for six hours before commissioners ordered psychological tests 
for Tyson before making a decision. This time, though, it was a far 
different atmosphere as Tyson sat with his wife, Monica, and lawyer, 
Jim Jimmerson before the five-member panel. Gone were other attorneys 
who presented the case in the first meeting and Finkel, who irritated 
the commission by trying to get Tyson licensed in New Jersey in August. 
Tyson and his wife both spoke to the commission instead of the lawyers. 
Johnson then gave a plea and Ali's wife, Lonnie, read a statement 
from her husband, who sat trembling next to her. ``I have made many 
mistakes in my lifetime that cost me dearly,'' Ali said in the statement. 
``Let this young man earn a living. Give him a chance to redeem himself 
in the ring.'' In the end, the commission did just that, voting quickly 
after the three hours' of testimony to restore the license that was 
revoked after Tyson shocked the world by biting Holyfield's ears during 
their June 28, 1997, heavyweight title fight. ``Mike, you have made 
a lot of mistakes in your life,'' said commission chairman Dr. Elias 
Ghanem. ``I know that sometimes you think you're a victim. But let 
me tell you, that most of your problems are of your own making. You 
and you alone have to take responsibility for your life.'' Tyson, 
dressed in a dark sports coat and dress shirt, drew laughter from 
a crowd of a few hundred people at times with his statements as he 
pleaded to be allowed to fight again. ``You gentlemen have no idea 
what it's like to be myself, no idea what it's like,'' Tyson said. 
``I'm not interested in being humiliated anymore.'' At only one point 
did Tyson appear to be losing his temper, when he was questioned by 
commissioner James Nave, who cast the only dissenting vote. His wife 
tapped him on the leg to try to keep him from talking further as he 
sparred verbally with Nave. ``I'm at your mercy,'' Tyson told Nave. 
``Please don't torture me any longer, sir.'' For half of the meeting, 
five doctors from Massachusetts General Hospital gave their evaluation 
of Tyson, who underwent five days of psychological testing there last 
month. The lead doctor, Ronald Schouten, testified that Tyson is ``a 
very complex individual with strengths not always apparent and weaknesses 
that are sometimes too apparent.'' Schouten said Tyson is in need 
of extensive psychotherapy and needs to learn how to control his emotions 
and anger. Tyson is also depressed and might have to take medication 
for that if the therapy doesn't work, the doctor said.
