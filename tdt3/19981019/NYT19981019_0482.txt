Tino Martinez had heard the speculation about his future with the 
Yankees, how it was in peril if he continued to have a dismal post-season. 
He heard the speculation about how the team's principal owner, George 
Steinbrenner, would trade him if the Yankees did not win the World 
Series, and then sign Mo Vaughn as Martinez's replacement. He heard 
the same old story and he cringed. It sounded as if it were rotisserie 
baseball. Why would the Yankees unload Martinez, a solid run producer 
and a solid citizen who is scheduled to make a relatively modest $5 
million in each of the next two seasons? Vaughn, a similar power hitter, 
wants at least $10 million a season as a free agent. This switch at 
first base would not make sense for the Yankees. Even though the Yankees 
insist they have not started the whispers, everything on the Yankees 
emanates from Steinbrenner, and Martinez apparently believes that 
the team has discussed it. Martinez did not try to decipher the logic. 
He tried to ignore the words, but he could not. Not even after a game-winning 
grand slam in Game 1 and three hits in Game 2 against San Diego lifted 
him from a prolonged post-season drought. ``I try not to really pay 
attention to it, but it bothered me because it came out now during 
the World Series,'' he said. ``Something like that shouldn't come 
out until the off season, regardless of what's happening. I have to 
admit it; it bothered me.'' Even before Martinez emerged from a 5-for-30 
slide, any conversations about his future should revolve around when 
the Yankees will offer the 30-year-old first baseman a contract extension. 
Martinez has hit .290 with 32 homers and 127 RBIs over the last three 
years, very comparable to Vaughn's .326, 39 and 117, and the Yankees 
have reached the post-season each year. In addition, Martinez, who 
is no Gold Glove Award candidate, is also a better fielder than Vaughn, 
who might be a designated hitter by 2000. To the Yankees, Martinez 
should be a keeper. ``When we brought Tino Martinez in, that was one 
of the turning points in the organization,'' his teammate David Cone 
said. ``He had big shoes to fill in Don Mattingly.'' If the Yankees 
are serious about trying to resign Bernie Williams, they might consider 
spending the $10 million or $11 million on him and not on Vaughn. 
Losing Williams to free agency, then signing Vaughn to make a splash 
and trading Martinez for a center fielder would weaken two positions 
on a team that might be recalled as one of the finest ever. Why tamper 
with greatness? And why tweak the ultra-sensitive Martinez? ``It got 
in my head and it bothered me,'' Martinez said about the Vaughn rumors. 
``I just got to go out there, play the World Series and, if it's my 
last series as a Yankee, enjoy it and try to win. Then go on with 
my career.'' For the cautious Martinez, mentioning the possibility 
of a new baseball address was a stunning statement. As Steinbrenner 
walked through the clubhouse on Sunday, he was asked if he has considered 
the possibility of trading Martinez and signing Vaughn. ``I don't 
even want to talk about that,'' Steinbrenner said. ``It's crazy. That's 
you guys stirring it up.'' Still, before he slipped into Manager Joe 
Torre's office, Steinbrenner added, ``But if that's gotten him going, 
OK.'' Steinbrenner is partly right. If Martinez needed to have his 
future questioned to erupt, maybe the escalation of the rumors about 
Vaughn was timely. But Martinez is too sturdy a hitter to remain 0 
for October, even if he was 21 for his first 118 at bats with a homer 
and 5 RBIs as a Yankee during the post-season. Now, Martinez has four 
hits in his last eight at-bats, but there is bitterness in his voice. 
``I don't need somebody trying to light a fire under me,'' Martinez 
said. ``I play hard every day and try to do my best whether I'm playing 
well or struggling, so it's not going to pump me up. I'm just going 
to play the way I like to play.'' Martinez is very proud and very 
loyal. So proud that he once told a reporter that he wanted the Yankees 
to view him as a $5 million bargain because that would mean he was 
doing his job. So loyal that he stayed home in Florida to play baseball 
at the University of Tampa, a Division II school, to be on the same 
team with his brother, Rene. His pride in his ability was evident 
and his loyalty to the Yankees was erratic as Martinez spoke passionately 
on Sunday. The rumors about Vaughn, which are fueled by Vaughn's desire 
to play in New York and his agent's close relationship with Steinbrenner, 
have stung Martinez, and that is unfortunate. Maybe a World Series 
title would help the hurt vanish. Maybe not. ``I love it here, but 
I don't want to be anywhere I'm not wanted,'' Martinez said. ``If 
they don't want me here and they feel they have somebody who can make 
the team better, then I'm all for it. I love it here, but I don't 
want to be somewhere wishing I wasn't here.''
