No, it's not your imagination. New York really does seem to be living 
through 1987 all over again. Just look at the calendar: Monday is 
Oct. 19, the very date that will live in financial infamy as Black 
Monday, when the stock market plunged 23 percent. And there are other, 
creepier parallels, as a glance over some old and new headlines will 
attest. Then, as now, Donald Trump was bent on gracing the city's 
skyline with a new ``world-class'' tower _ although back then it was 
the West Side (``Celebrities Open Wallets to Fight Trump's Project''), 
while this time it's the East Side (``Trump Starts New Tower Near 
the U.N.''). Then, as now, scandal rocked Wall Street's elite _ except 
then it was insider trading starring Ivan Boesky, not hedge-fund havoc 
with John Meriwether. And then, as now, George Steinbrenner was threatening 
to move the Yankees to New Jersey. As they do today, tourists thronged 
the streets, to the increasing annoyance of the natives. In the city, 
prices of luxury co-ops were in the stratosphere, as they are now, 
and new office towers were sprouting in midtown, a little to the north 
and west of today's hot spot, Times Square. Unemployment dropped to 
levels unseen in years, like nowadays. But the stock market began 
falling from its peak in the summer, just as it did this year. Worrywarts 
brooded about the city's growing dependence on Wall Street. And, as 
if to confirm those fears, Salomon Brothers on Oct. 12, 1987, announced 
big layoffs _ much as Merrill Lynch announced last week (on Oct. 13, 
to be precise) that it was eliminating thousands of jobs, including 
1,000 employees and outside consultants in the city. Sure, there are 
differences, and not merely the Land Rovers in place of Jaguars as 
status symbols. Investment in the stock market is more pervasive, 
thanks to mutual funds and retirement plans, but investors seem less 
likely to be spooked _ at least so far. After all, they still have 
the gains they made during three years of astonishingly high returns. 
And most important, interest rates are far lower than they were in 
1987; in fact, they are lower now than they were just last week, thanks 
to the Federal Reserve's actions Thursday. After the Crash of 1987, 
there were some immediate forecasts of gloom and doom, but many in 
the city pooh-poohed the notion that Wall Street's troubles would 
have a broad effect on most New Yorkers. For a time they seemed to 
be right. But by the end of the following year, New York City government 
revenues had fallen sharply, including toll collections, since there 
were fewer commuters into Manhattan. The jobless rate began to climb. 
By the spring of 1989 many who had bought apartments at the peak found 
that they could not sell them for enough to cover their mortgages. 
The real recession had begun. It turned out that axing all those fat 
cats on Wall Street had an effect on other people _ restaurant owners, 
accountants, lawyers, bicycle messengers, real estate agents, panhandlers. 
It just takes a while for the economic effects of any change to filter 
out into the broader society. None of this means that a similar recession 
is just around the corner in the city that considers itself the world's 
financial capital. This time around, the national economy is in much 
better shape: The federal government is not running a deficit, inflation 
is not a worry, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan isn't 
raising interest rates as he was in 1987. The city's finances are 
in far better shape too, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has already budgeted 
for lower tax receipts from Wall Street. But those who forget history 
_ well, you know. Or, as they say on Wall Street, ``The most dangerous 
words in the English language are, `It's different this time.' ''
