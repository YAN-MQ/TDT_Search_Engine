The judge who dismissed Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against 
President Clinton is posting previously secret materials from the 
case on the Internet today. But President Clinton's deposition will 
not be among the documents. The judge says it wasn't on file with 
the court. The videotape of the deposition is in the hands of the 
house Judiciary committee. You know we're hoping to see some surprises, 
just to make it continue to be interesting and informative. But you 
know we've seen a lot of the information already attached to motions 
which were not sealed, and we've had lots of leaks in the case. I 
suppose what we may discover is that some of the leaks, some of the 
information we've heard may be true, may not be true, but will be 
confirmed or not confirmed in today's document dump.
