Mike Tyson was given his boxing license back Monday after pleading 
with officials to stop ``torturing'' him and allow him to return to 
the sport he once dominated. Tyson told the Nevada Athletic Commission 
that he has suffered enough for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during 
a title fight last year and that he needs to box to make a living. 
Chairman Elias Ghanem said Tyson had made many mistakes in his life 
but deserved another chance. The commission voted 4-1 to restore the 
fighter's license. Tyson was near tears when he heard that he could 
return to the ring, as his supporters hugged him and patted on his 
back.
