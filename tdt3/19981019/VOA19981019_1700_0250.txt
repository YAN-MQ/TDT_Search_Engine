Here in Washington, a long awaited antitrust trial pitting computer 
giant Microsoft against the U.S. government has opened. Observers 
say this trial could determine the course of the software industry 
for years to come. We have a report from VOA's Rick Nunez. The Justice 
Department says Microsoft has abused its position as the world's preeminent 
maker of computer software to smother potential business rivals. Microsoft's 
General Counsel, William Newcomb, company competes vigorously but 
fairly. As he entered Federal court he expressed confidence his client 
will prevail. We believe that the facts and the law are on our side. 
The U.S. government, along with 20 states, filed the antitrust lawsuit 
in May. Prosecutors accused Microsoft of illegally exploiting its 
dominance of computer operating systems to seize control of the Internet 
browser market. Browser software allows users to navigate the worldwide 
web. The trial could take between six and eight weeks. Government 
witnesses will include officials from Apple Computers and chip maker 
Intel. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, one of the richest men in the 
world, is not expected to take the stand. Rick Nunez, VOA News, Washington.
