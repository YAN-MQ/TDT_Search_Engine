With dozens of charred bodies littering the town, authorities began 
burying at least 500 people on Monday, victims of a devastating pipeline 
explosion over the weekend. Some who were too burned to be identified 
would be placed in mass graves, officials said. Although flames from 
the ruptured gasoline pipeline occasionally flared up to 20 meters 
(65 feet) in the air, by late Monday firefighters had stopped fighting 
the blaze and said they would wait for it to burn out. Meanwhile relatives 
converged on the disaster scene in Jesse, 300 kilometers (180 miles) 
southeast of Lagos, to search for remains of their loved ones. ``It 
is finished,'' cried student Charity Unurhoro, after finding the horribly 
burned bodies of her mother and brother. ``Now everything is over 
for me.'' As she cried, a man told a young relative to fetch a wheelbarrow 
to take the corpses home for burial. The fire, which began Saturday 
as residents scooped gasoline spilling from a pipeline, killed at 
least 500 people and left at least 100 hospitalized, military officials 
said. The area's hospitals _ most of which only have a handful of 
doctors and nurses and little in the way of burn care _ were overwhelmed 
by the disaster, with doctors overworked and medicine in short supply, 
local officials said.
