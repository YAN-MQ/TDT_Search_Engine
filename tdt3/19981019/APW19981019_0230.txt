Mike Tyson pleaded with boxing officials Monday to stop ``torturing'' 
him and allow him to return to the sport he once dominated. Tyson 
told the Nevada Athletic Commission that he has suffered enough for 
biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a title fight last year and 
that he needs to box to make a living. Muhammad Ali agreed, testifying 
that Tyson has made mistakes but deserves another chance. ``There 
are only a few punishments worse than being denied a right to make 
a living,'' Ali said in a statement read by his wife, Lonnie, who 
sat next to the ailing boxing great. Ali was banned from the sport 
for 3 1/2 years for refusing military induction. In one pointed exchange 
with commissioner James Nave, Tyson said he was humiliated by the 
hearing and the psychological tests the commission told him to undergo 
last month. ``Please don't torture me any longer, sir,'' Tyson said. 
``I made a mistake. Other fighters have made more. ``I'm just a human 
being trying to live my life.'' With a couple of hundred people watching, 
Tyson said he has no one to blame but himself for biting Holyfield, 
but he once again said he was reacting to what he thought were intentional 
head-butts from the champion. Tyson also denied accusations that he 
punched and kicked two men following a fender-bender in Maryland in 
August. The commission has said that the case, set for trial in December, 
is important to its decision on whether to give the boxer back the 
license it revoked when he bit Holyfield. ``I'm not going to kill 
anybody. I'm not a mass murderer,'' Tyson told the commissioners when 
asked about his ability to control his temper. His wife, Monica, who 
was in the car with Tyson, told the commission she never saw her husband 
hit anybody following the accident. Tyson's hearing came one month 
after he was told to undergo the psychological tests to help the officials 
make their decision. The doctors who examined Tyson tried to reassure 
the commissioners that the fighter most likely won't snap again in 
the ring, a conclusion they outlined in their report, released last 
week. Dr. Ronald Schouten, one of five doctors who examined Tyson 
at Massachusetts General Hospital, told the commissioners Monday that 
the boxer's low self-esteem was a ``chronic situation'' but that he 
could be helped through treatment. He said Tyson was so upset by losing 
his license that he most likely would not do anything to jeopardize 
it in the future. ``The impact of losing his license has been devastating,'' 
Schouten said. ``He wants his job back.'' Tyson lawyer James Jimmerson 
opened the hearing by reminding the commissioners that his client 
has done everything asked of him. He said Tyson was approaching the 
hearing with a sense of ``honesty, fairness and doing the right thing.'' 
``You have his livelihood and his life in your hands,'' Jimmerson 
said. Tyson sat next to his wife, Monica, at a table in front of the 
commissioners. He stared at the doctors intently as they testified 
and occasionally leaned over to whisper to his wife, a physician. 
If he gets his boxing license back, Tyson will fight once again _ 
perhaps as early as December. A loss will put him out of the sport 
for at least another year. Tyson is taking a calculated gamble he 
can get three votes from the five-member commission to resurrect a 
career that seemed doomed after he bit Holyfield 15 months ago. ``I 
don't know, but I'm hopeful,'' Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel said before 
the hearing. ``I think our chances are better than they were before.'' 
The five-day exam was what commissioners wanted when they recessed 
a six-hour hearing Sept. 19 without making a decision on Tyson's license. 
But a clean bill of mental health won't be enough to get Tyson back 
the license that was revoked when he also comes with questions about 
a Maryland traffic altercation still hanging over his head _ questions 
that he refused to answer in his first Nevada hearing a month ago; 
questions that will have to be answered if he is going to fight again. 
Tyson's advisers pushed for the earliest possible hearing so that 
Tyson could fight before the end of the year, probably Dec. 5 at the 
MGM Grand hotel-casino in Las Vegas. If the gamble fails, he will 
be banned from the sport for at least another year _ a crippling blow 
for an aging heavyweight who owes the Internal Revenue Service dlrs 
13 million in unpaid taxes despite having made more than dlrs 100 
million in purses since his release from prison in 1995. Tyson appears,
