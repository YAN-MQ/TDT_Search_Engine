Joe Torre's relatives knew. They didn't want tickets for the first 
round of the playoffs, or the American League championship series. 
Why waste money? ``So the pressure was on to get to the World Series, 
so I can see all those people,'' he said, not kidding at all. Ever 
since the Yankees won 114 games, New York and Torre's family have 
thought a World Series was preordained. Throughout this October, he's 
the one urging caution. Perhaps it's his background as a catcher. 
He's seen up close what can go wrong. So as New York piled up win 
after win, he never relaxed. One game at a time, he said. Don't look 
ahead. ``I'm not sure I did anything to help them. I think I got in 
the way more than anything else,'' he said one afternoon before the 
Yankees opened the World Series last week. He was referring to what 
he did after New York fell behind Cleveland 2-1, but he might as well 
have been talking about his entire three seasons with the Yankees. 
The players love him, but in his mind, his contribution is small. 
``Somebody has to write a lineup and pat guys on the rear end if they 
do well and make a pitching change now and then,'' Torre said. ``It 
is a job that I love. It is a great challenge. How important is it? 
I think players look to coaches and managers at certain times just 
to get a feel of the mood and the confidence. ``I think my job at 
this point in time is to show that I have confidence in every single 
one of them in whatever move I make. But again, I never will ever 
say or feel that this game belongs to managers. It is the players' 
game.'' Joseph Paul Torre, the 58-year-old manager of the Yankees, 
is two wins from sweeping San Diego, two games from joining Miller 
Huggins, Joe McCarthy, Casey Stengel and Ralph Houk as the only men 
to lead the Yankees to a pair of World Series titles. He is understated. 
It's always we, never me. It's always the players when things go well. 
It's the manager's fault when there's a breakdown. ``It's tough to 
make a bad decision when you have the quality that I have,'' he said. 
He spent 18 seasons as a player with the Braves, Cardinals and Mets, 
winning one batting title and one MVP award, but never making it to 
postseason play. Finally, two years ago, he made it to the Series 
and led the Yankees to a 4-2 win over Atlanta. But his brother Frank 
was in a hospital for the first five games, awaiting a life-saving 
heart transplant. The day before the Yankees won Game 6, Frank got 
his new heart. Joe was joyous for Frank, now visible by the batting 
cage before postseason games. But Joe was still mourning brother Rocco, 
who died of a heart attack that June. ``Two years ago, everything 
just happened at one time, basically,'' Joe said. ``At age 55, everybody 
figures, especially in baseball, that you will be winding down and 
things started winding up.'' Joe was voted co-manager of the year 
in the American League that year and is a top candidate again this 
season after leading New York to a 114-48 record, the most wins ever 
in the American League.
