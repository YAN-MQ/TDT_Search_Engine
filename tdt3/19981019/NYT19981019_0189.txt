When Americans go off daylight time at 2 a.m. on Sunday, they will 
need to set their clocks _ and their bodies _ back an hour. To the 
rescue, Dr. Alfred Lewy, an expert on resetting biological clocks 
and a professor at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. 
Six months ago, Lewy proposed a system for speeding the adjustment 
to daylight time. This time, he has a regimen to help people shift 
their body clocks the other way, relying on the body's two main zeitgebers, 
or time keepers _ sunlight and the hormone melatonin produced by a 
tiny gland at night. Lewy's prescription: First thing Saturday morning, 
take a tiny dose of melatonin _ between 0.1 and 0.5 milligrams (100 
to 500 micrograms) and repeat that for the next two or three mornings. 
(Do not drive if the melatonin makes you sleepy.) On Sunday, avoid 
sunlight for the first hour of daylight by wearing dark sunglasses. 
The shift back to standard time, Lewy says, is tougher than adjusting 
to daylight time because the earlier dawn is counterproductive to 
the needed change in body time.
