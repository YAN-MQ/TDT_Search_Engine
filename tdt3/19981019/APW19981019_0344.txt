An opposition coalition claimed victory Monday in Macedonia's elections, 
but the ex-communist incumbents said results were inconclusive, leaving 
the shape of the country's next government unclear. Regardless of 
official results to be announced later, the dispute could lead to 
political tension in Macedonia, the only former Yugoslav republic 
that gained independence without bloodshed in 1992. The reformist 
opposition coalition said its vote count from Sunday's parliamentary 
elections showed it had far outdistanced all other parties by winning 
44 seats in the 120-seat assembly. With most seats still to be determined 
in a second round Nov. 1, such a showing would almost certainly oust 
the incumbent government. But the ruling Social Democrats contended 
the opposition had clinched only 15 seats _ the same as their own 
total _ arguing that a low turnout invalidated the others. Turnout 
in each municipality must be at least one-third of registered voters 
for results to be valid. State electoral officials hinted late Monday 
that they agreed with the incumbents' interpretation of the complex 
election law, which would give the Social Democrats a reprieve from 
a disastrous defeat. But electoral commission chief Ljiljana Ristova 
would not elaborate on the commission's position, and no results were 
available. Official results are required to be released no later than 
Tuesday, but the dispute raised the possibility of a delay. Ethnic 
Albanian parties said they had won 22 seats. The incumbents led the 
country peacefully to independence from Yugoslavia. But the opposition 
coalition, comprised of younger politicians, is striving for radical 
political and economic reforms. ``This is a great victory, and we 
hope for an even better outcome in the second round,'' Ljuben Paunovski, 
the opposition coalition's spokesman, told Macedonian television. 
A total of 38 parties contested the elections, all focusing on the 
country's economic woes during the campaign. Macedonia, with a population 
of about 2 million, was the poorest of all six republics in the former 
Yugoslav federation and its economy remains feeble, with 30 percent 
unemployment and an average salary of dlrs 210 a month. Situated near 
the volatile Serbian province of Kosovo in Yugoslavia, Macedonia has 
disputes with all its neighbors. It also has a restive ethnic Albanian 
minority.
