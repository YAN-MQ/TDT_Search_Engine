for thousands of older Americans. Will your parents face even higher 
medical costs? Hey, I got a letter back from quaker. You wrote to 
quaker? Yeah. I told 'em quaker toasted oatmeal... oughta be called 
quaker tasty oatmeal. It's oatmeal. It's toasted. to me, that says 
"tasty." Well, then they should call it that. You need a hobby. Quaker 
toasted oatmeal. Deliciously crisp oatmeal flakes with honey-sweetened 
oat clusters. So what does quaker say? Well, they thanked me for my 
interest but said, "product will remain quaker toasted oatmeal." What 
a shock. Quaker tasty-- uh, toasted oatmeal and quaker oatmeal squares. 
There are those among us with very simple tastes. They only want the 
best. ( ping. Ping. Ping. ) and for them there's fancy feast gourmet 
cat food. Exceptionally moist and delicious. Fancy feast. No matter
