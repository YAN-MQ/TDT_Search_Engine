Opening a conference on African development, Japan's prime minister 
said Monday that his country's economic problems will not interfere 
with its economic aid to African nations. Premier Keizo Obuchi told 
the 2nd Tokyo International Conference on African Development that 
Japan's and other Asian countries' commitment to the continent will 
not waver. ``Japan is faced with a severe financial situation,'' Obuchi 
told the gathering of 82 countries and 40 organizations. ``But we 
will continue to take initiatives to aid Africa.'' The gathering, 
which follows one held five years ago in Tokyo, will focus on the 
role of education, women, agriculture and private-sector investment 
in development. The issue of aid to Africa comes at a tough time for 
Japan, which is grappling with its deepest recession since the end 
of World War II. Unemployment and bankruptcy debt are at record highs. 
Japan's economic problems are part of the year-old Asian financial 
crisis, which has crippled several economies in the region and now 
threatens Russia, Latin America _ and Africa. Growth forecasts for 
Africa have been slashed from 4 percent to just over 1 percent as 
sluggish global demand has imposed lower prices on African commodity 
exports, said James Gustave Speth, administrator of the United Nations 
Development Program. Despite the problems, Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad told the group that Africa can still learn a lot 
about economic development from Asia. ``Adopting the Asian approach 
and the Asian way toward development is still a good strategy,'' Mahathir 
said. Obuchi said Japan will extend financial and technical support 
for a plan to send 2,000 people from African countries for training 
in Asia in the next five years, Kyodo News reported. Japan currently 
accepts 1,000 people a year for technical training. Japan will also 
work toward an Asia-Africa business forum to spur private-sector investment 
in Africa, he said. Japan also plans to support the ``self-help'' 
efforts of African countries and urge other developed nations to help 
solve or prevent regional conflicts in Africa, Obuchi said. Participants 
in the conference include U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the 
leaders of Swaziland, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Djibouti, Mozambique, 
Botswana and Benin. The conference is expected to issue an ``Agenda 
for Action'' on Wednesday aimed at halving the number of people living 
in absolute poverty by 2015 through economic growth and sustainable 
development. The event is jointly staged by the Japanese government, 
the United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa, an informal 
forum for dialogue among developed and developing countries.
