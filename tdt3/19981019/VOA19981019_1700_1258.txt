Arbitrator John Ferrick has rejected a grievance by the NBA Players 
Association to force owners to pay players with guaranteed contracts 
during the current labor dispute. The ruling in New York Monday strengthened 
the owners bargaining position by removing the prospect of having 
to pay more than $700 million to 226 players with guaranteed contracts. 
Ferrick who ruled quickly on Latrell Spreewell's dual grievance case 
earlier this year used the full 30 days allotted to reach his decision. 
The union had argued that players with guaranteed contracts must be 
paid during the lockout. The League claimed that its decision not 
to pay the players is legal during a work stoppage. It is uncertain 
whether the ruling will have any impact on the stalemate between the 
player's union and the National Basketball Association which is now 
in the 111th day of a player lockout. The owners made a revised offer 
on the luxury tax suggested by the Players Association on Friday but 
no further negotiations between the two sides have been scheduled.
