Bavarian state police apprehended 37 ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia's 
troubled Kosovo province at Georgenberg on the Czech border Monday. 
Police in Waidhaus said the refugees apparently had been traveling 
two days in the back of a windowless truck to reach the Czech border, 
where smugglers brought them into Germany overnight and abandoned 
them. Among the group were nine children and eight women. All were 
shipped back to the Czech Republic immediately. Under German asylum 
law, refugees who can be shown to have arrived from a safe third country 
are sent back there if they want to apply for asylum. In Bonn, the 
Interior Ministry said 706 people in all, mostly from Kosovo and Romania, 
were caught trying to enter Germany illegally over the past three 
days. Officials said 167 were immediately sent back to the country 
they arrived from. They included 78 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo found 
crammed in the back of a small truck in Tirschenreuth, 15 kilometers 
(9 miles) from the Czech border early Saturday. In a move to stop 
a flood of refugees, 26 people smugglers were arrested in the crackdown 
coordinated between police of nine European Union countries, a ministry 
statement said.
