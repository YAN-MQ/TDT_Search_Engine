Tony Gwynn was standing alone in right field, checking out the grass 
torn up a day earlier by an National Football League game, and his 
hearty laugh echoed throughout the empty ballpark. Gwynn was the first 
player on the field for the San Diego Padres' practice Monday afternoon, 
and his disposition matched the weather _ bright sunshine, blue California 
sky and warm temperatures. A change of scenery for the World Series, 
for sure, from the subway trains clacking outside Yankee Stadium to 
the palm trees inside Qualcomm Stadium. But a change in the Padres' 
luck against the New York Yankees? No telling. The Yankees look unbeatable 
so far, taking a 2-0 lead into Game 3 Tuesday night. David Cone will 
start against former Yankees pitcher Sterling Hitchcock. ``What I've 
seen from New York in the first two games, I'll have to admit, is 
very impressive,'' Gwynn said. ``We're down 0-2, but we can get back 
in this thing if we play our game, which is pitching and defense and 
some timely hits.'' Gwynn has done his part, tied for the Series lead 
with four hits. Yet unless Padres pitching improves, it could be over 
real soon. Of the 44 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the World Series, 
33 have gone on to win the championship. Then again, the Yankees were 
wiped out at home by Atlanta in the first two games in 1996 before 
coming back to win four in a row. Cone began that comeback with a 
win in Game 3. Cone traveled to the West Coast on Sunday, before the 
Yankees romped 9-3 in Game 2. He was already in San Diego relaxing 
while watching the victory. ``This is the time of year when pitchers 
feel a bit fatigued,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to closing this 
out and getting a nice rest.'' Hitchcock already has beaten Houston's 
Randy Johnson and Atlanta's Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine in the playoffs. 
Now he's likely to face his toughest challenge, trying to shut down 
a Yankees team that scored nine runs in two straight nights against 
San Diego. ``They can hit. Bottom line, they can hit,'' Hitchcock 
said. Hitchcock, however, will have a few advantages that Padres starters 
Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby did not have. For one thing, he's feeling 
a little better, aside from some congestion _ a flu bug bit the San 
Diego staff right before the opener. Hitchcock will have two other 
factors in his favor _ he'll be facing a lineup that does not include 
a designated hitter, and he'll be pitching at twilight. The DH is 
not used for games at the National League park, meaning Cone, a career 
.152 hitter, will be batting. That could mean Chili Davis will be 
on the bench, although Yankees manager Joe Torre held out the ``wild 
card'' possibility Davis might play left field. Game 3 is scheduled 
to begin at 5:20 p.m. PDT (0020 GMT Wednesday), a time when shadows 
can make it difficult for hitters to see the ball. Despite the early 
start, the park should be almost filled by the first pitch. Unlike 
crowds for other Southern California baseball teams, the Padres fans 
are known for making noise.
