Here at home, another terrible day across most of southern Texas. 
The rain kept coming down, the rivers up. At least a dozen people 
killed. The flood waters have sent hundreds of people running from 
their homes. Erin Hayes in new Braunfels, Texas. It just will not 
stop. The water is forcing people to run from their homes. It is flash 
flooding, powerful enough to deposit a cow on a rooftop, realign everything 
in its path. And it is frightening. Linda fuchs and her husband were 
racing home to get their children and their truck was swamped. They 
said our house is gone. There are now several thousand people out 
of their homes in south texas. Many have lost everything. This is 
where my house was. This man's house was sheared off. By the guadalupe 
river, it rose 25 feet in two hours. This was a two-story house, and 
if you look at the tree line up here, you'll see the debris. Just 
the very tip-tops of those trees. That's how high the river was. In 
the town of new Braunfels, more than 30 homes swept away, a Trail 
of debris where they stood. The crosbys' house is gone. The boysenberrys' 
house is gone. They got no warning but they are warning their fellow 
texans downstream. I tell them to get out. Get out quick. Erin Hayes, 
ABC News, new Braunfels, Texas.
