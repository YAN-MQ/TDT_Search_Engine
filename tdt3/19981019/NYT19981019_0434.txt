Madison Avenue bustled in recent days as a variety of marketers made 
changes on advertising assignments with billings estimated at more 
than $230 million. One of the biggest account changes comes from Hardee's 
Food Systems Inc., the fast-food chain, which moved the national creative 
part of its account to the Leap Partnership in Chicago after just 
eight months at Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York. Billings were 
estimated at $100 million. Sharon Hamilton, a spokeswoman for Hardee's, 
a unit of CKE Restaurants in Rocky Mount, N.C., said that although 
the current campaign from Angotti, Thomas, called ``Go all out,'' 
had ``entertainment value and humor, it did not effectively communicate 
the quality aspects of Hardee's food.'' Ms. Hamilton said Hardee's 
recently requested a new approach from Angotti, Thomas, a unit of 
Interpublic Group of Cos., and invited Leap to make proposals. Leap, 
a unit of Leap Group, was a ``close second'' in a previous review 
that ended with the selection of Angotti, Thomas, Ms. Hamilton said. 
The final decision was made by a team that included members from CKE, 
Hardee's senior management and Hardee's franchisees. Leap, which is 
Hardee's sixth agency in four years, had a ``more aggressive approach,'' 
Ms. Hamilton said, adding that the company's new ads would be more 
focused on food. A campaign is expected to begin in January. Western 
International Media in Los Angeles, also owned by Interpublic, continues 
to handle the media part of the account. Two other account changes 
are from Internet marketers. Geocities in Santa Monica, Calif., named 
Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York as the first agency to handle 
its integrated account, with combined billings estimated at $15 million 
to $20 million. The decision came without a review; Thomas Evans, 
president and chief executive of Geocities, and Bruce Nelson, chief 
knowledge officer at Y&AMP;R, have worked together before. The Y&AMP;R 
units handling the account are Y&AMP;R Advertising, for consumer advertising 
research; Brand Dialogue, interactive services; Wunderman Cato Johnson, 
advertising and relationship marketing; Landor Associates, corporate 
design, and the Media Edge, media research, planning and placement. 
The other Internet account changing hands is Excite Inc. in Redwood 
City, Calif., which operates the Excite search engine. It has named 
Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in New York as agency of record for its consumer 
advertising account, which was handled for the last year by the San 
Francisco office of Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, a unit of True North 
Communications. Billings are estimated at as much as $25 million to 
$30 million. Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, was 
awarded the account after a three-month review. The other participants 
were not disclosed, but the trade publications said three agencies 
in San Francisco were among the finalists: Citron Haligman Bedecarre, 
which handled a project for Excite's classified division; Goldberg 
Moser O'Neill, and TBWA/Chiat/Day, a unit of Omnicom Group. In another 
change, Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in Chicago said it had resigned 
the creative and strategic parts of the Midas Inc. account after almost 
14 months. Billings were estimated at $60 million. Management changes 
at Midas made it ``clear to us that it is in our best interest to 
part company,'' said Brian Williams, president of the Chicago office 
of Foote, Cone, a unit of True North Communications. TN Media in Chicago, 
a sibling True North agency, continues to handle media buying. Midas, 
the operator of auto-repair shops, said in a statement that it had 
decided to initiate a review for the duties handled by Foote, Cone 
and that the agency initially ``had agreed to participate'' but then 
resigned on Friday. Bob Troyer, a spokesman for Midas in Chicago, 
said a ``limited number of agencies'' would now proceed in the review, 
but he declined to identify them. A decision is expected in mid-December, 
he added. The Midas account has bounced from agency to agency over 
the last couple of years. Before Foote, Cone, the account was handled 
by the J. Walter Thompson Chicago unit of WPP Group PLC until that 
agency resigned because of a conflict with its important Ford Motor 
Co. account. Another marketer, Coca-Cola Co., has expanded its relationship 
with Leo Burnett USA in Chicago by naming that agency to handle the 
creative assignment for its Coca-Cola and Sprite brands aimed at Spanish-speaking 
consumers in the United States. The account, with billings estimated 
at $15 million, was previously handled by Casadevall Pedreno &AMP; 
PRG in Barcelona, Spain. Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in 
Atlanta, confirmed a report of the assignment this week in Advertising 
Age. He said that Burnett, part of Leo Burnett Co., was awarded the 
additional account without a review; it already handles general-market 
creative assignments for the company's Surge, Fruitopia, Hi-C and 
Minute Maid brands. Finally, Rite-Aid Inc., the drugstore chain based 
in Camp Hill, Pa., has named Lowe Fox Pavlika in New York as the first 
agency to handle its direct marketing. Billings were estimated at 
$15 million to $20 million. Advertising continues to be handled by 
Marc Advertising in Pittsburgh. Lowe Fox is part of the Lowe &AMP; 
Partners/SMS division of Lowe Group, a unit of Interpublic.
