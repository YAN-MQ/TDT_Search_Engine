Hundreds of firefighters continue to struggle with a fire near lake 
Piru in california's Ventura county, officials say it may have been 
started by a Spark from a welder's torch. Another wild fire north 
of Santa Barbara has burned at least 2,200 acres in the Los padres 
national forest. Forest service officials say light winds and dry 
conditions fueled the fire over the weekend and have been hampering 
fire-fighting efforts.
