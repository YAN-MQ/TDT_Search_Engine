Leaders of the federal express pilots union voted unanimously Sunday 
to ask its membership for permission to call a strike. Ballots will 
be sent to the 3,200 members this week. If two-thirds of the pilots 
approve, the union could call a strike during the busy holiday season. 
FedEx says its latest offer would give its pilots the second-highest 
pay in the industry.
