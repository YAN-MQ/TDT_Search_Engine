``What red-blooded American hasn't surveyed the muck and mire of our 
national politics,'' writes Mark Jurkowitz of The Boston Globe, ``and 
said, `Enough, already'?'' ``Time magazine reports that Clinton's 
woes have left U.S. foreign policy adrift,'' writes The Guardian of 
London, ``though Garrison Keillor says, `Enough already!''' Howard 
Fineman of Newsweek asks, ``Is there any way out of this mess?'' leading 
to an inch-high, 102-point, block-letter headline: ``ENOUGH ALREADY.'' 
The stylistic issue raised is: Should there be a comma between the 
first and second words of this increasingly important phrase? The 
publication that pioneered in its popularization is The Toronto Globe 
and Mail; of the 19,000 entries in the Dow Jones database, the first 
22 uses (from 1977 to 1983) were in that newspaper. According to Warren 
Clements, style editor, ``We abandoned the comma in 1979 because enough 
already was considered one of those expressions that is almost one 
word. It rips rollingly off the tongue; the comma would slow it down.'' 
Adds Michael Kesterton of that newspaper, ``I know it's a Yiddishism, 
but it just fits the Canadian soul _ you know, `I've had it and I'm 
not gonna take it anymore.''' The origin is the Yiddish genug shoyn, 
literally ``enough already.'' It is part of an array of phrases using 
shoyn for emphasis, from the similar gut shoyn, ``All right already!'' 
in the sense of ``Stop bugging me,'' to shvayg shtil shoyn, ``Shut 
up already!'' one calibration more irritated than genug shoyn. ``This 
use of already began to appear early in the century,'' says Sol Steinmetz, 
the lexicographer who has taken the place of the late Leo Rosten as 
my primary Yiddish adviser, ``among immigrant Yiddish speakers living 
in New York who were just starting to talk English. By the 1930s it 
had become common usage among their children who no longer spoke Yiddish 
_ a development that enabled it to entrench itself in the American 
language.'' Another scholar, Lillian Feinsilver, in her ``Taste of 
Yiddish'' (1970), notes that ``English would normally use the mild 
now, as in `Come, now,' or the stronger `Come on, now.''' Now is an 
adverb of time that can be used as an admonition before a statement 
(``Now, I want you to listen to this ...''). Similarly, already and 
yet are adverbs of time that can be used to intensify a statement 
when used at the end. (``Were you bitten by a mad dog?'' ``And the 
dog is mad, yet.'') Thus, already _ in standard English, ``beforehand; 
by this time'' _ can be used in this idiomatic sense to mean ``without 
further ado'' or ``and you'd better believe it.'' We have seen how 
this Yiddishism has been thoroughly assimilated and is now an Americanism. 
Because other American English expressions have been adopted in many 
other languages _ OK and no problem are examples _ does this mean 
that this particular emphasis of exasperation is taking root elsewhere? 
Some evidence exists that it does. Here is a letter to The Washington 
Post from Robert Hill, an American working in a large Saudi hospital 
in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: ``The overwhelming _ by 9 to 1 _ response 
to the Clinton affair varies among `What is the very big deal?' to 
`What about the problems in the rest of the world?' to `Enough already!''' 
When a Yiddishism takes root in Riyadh, that's saying something. Have 
we exhausted this subject? The reader may now vent exasperation at 
a surfeit of data by expostulating the very phrase being so minutely 
examined. WHAT AM I? At a chic Washington cocktail party, Elizabeth 
Drew, author of ``Whatever It Takes: The Real Struggle for Political 
Power in America,'' accepted an hors d'oeuvre of chopped liver smeared 
on a cracker and asked: ``Chopped liver is delicious. Why do people 
derogate it so? As in the expression, `What am I, chopped liver?''' 
The earliest use of this phrase in its derogatory sense _ that is, 
``something trivial; something to be scoffed at'' _ in the Random 
House Historical Dictionary of American Slang is by Jimmy Durante 
on his 1954 CBS-TV show: ``Now that ain't chopped liver.'' In a 1980 
monologue about the Reagan-Carter presidential debate, Johnny Carson 
noted Ronald Reagan's statement that if all the unemployed were lined 
up, they would stretch from New York to Los Angeles. ``He came up 
with another one today,'' said Carson. ``If everyone on welfare were 
chopped liver, you could spread them on a line of Ritz crackers from 
here to Bulgaria.'' A decade later, the actor-producer Michael Douglas 
applied the phrase to himself, complaining about his secondary role 
in a movie: ``That hurt me in the industry as an actor, and it ticked 
me off. I thought, What was I _ chopped liver or something?'' This 
show-biz usage contributed to the treatment of the ethnic culinary 
delicacy (in Yiddish, gehakte leber) as an object of disdain. It may 
have also been influenced by its sense in underworld lingo as ``a 
beaten and scarred person,'' or by the urbanization of the once-rural 
expression ``That ain't hay.'' Steinmetz speculates: ``Chopped liver 
is merely an appetizer or side dish, not as important as chicken soup 
or gefilte fish. Hence it was often used among Jewish comedians in 
the Borscht Belt as a humorous metaphor for something or someone insignificant.'' 
Nobody who tastes properly made chopped liver can use it as a derogation. 
I turned to my New York Times colleague Marian Burros, author of ``The 
New Elegant but Easy Cookbook,'' for the recipe: ``Saute one finely 
chopped medium onion in two tablespoons hot chicken fat until lightly 
golden and very soft. Add 1 pound chicken liver and saute until cooked 
through; process in food processor with one small raw onion and one 
hard-cooked egg. Season with salt and pepper and mix with enough chicken 
fat to make it moist and spreadable.'' Then you can say, ``I feel 
just as terrific as chopped liver!''
