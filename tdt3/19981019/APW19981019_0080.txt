Fire that gutted an army barracks in Russia's Far East killed two 
soldiers, a news report said Monday. The two soldiers in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk 
were killed when fire engulfed their barracks late Sunday night, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Firefighters were called in to battle 
the blaze, but could not control it and the entire barracks burned 
down. Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is the capital of Sakhalin Island, located 
off Russia's Pacific coast. The region has been plagued by forest 
fires in recent months.
