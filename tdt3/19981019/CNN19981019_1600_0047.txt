In light of that bombing in Israel today, the key players in the mideast 
peace talks are narrowing their focus to security issues. All other 
concerns are being set aside at the summit in Maryland. President 
Clinton is rejoining the talks which were extended to a fifth unscheduled 
day. Sources tell CNN Mr. Clinton will meet with both Palestinian 
authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu in the next hour. President Clinton admits the attack complicated 
the talks, but is urging the two sides to move forward. I'm now returning 
to the Middle East peace talks to encourage the Israelis and the Palestinians 
to make the hard sdpitions necessary to move this peace process forward. 
As I said when we launched the talks last week, the United States 
will do everything we can to help. But ultimately only the parties 
themselves can bridge their differences. And put their people on a 
more hopeful course. It was two grenades which exploded at the main 
bus station in beersheba in southern Israel this morning. At least 
60 people were hurt. Passers by grabbed the suspected attacker. Police 
identified him as a West Bank Palestinian. The man claims he acted 
alone. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Israeli 
sources tell CNN the attack will not stop the peace talks. But they 
say the focus must be on security for a deal to be struck. The prime 
minister understands that the attack gives evidence of the fact that 
now we need a detailed security plan from the Palestinians more than 
ever. Israel has done its end of the bargain. It has come up with 
a way to address the need for a 13% redeployment. It's now time to 
for the Palestinians to fulfill their end of the bargain by coming 
up with a detailed security plan. The PLO ambassador to the United 
States issued this statement.
