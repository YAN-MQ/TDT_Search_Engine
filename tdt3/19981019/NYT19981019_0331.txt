You might wonder why anyone would want to be the nation's No. 1 maker 
of kitty litter. But for G. Craig Sullivan, chief executive of the 
Clorox Co., such a distinction is part of where he wants the company 
to go. Sullivan has said he wants Clorox to be No. 2 or better in 
every category in which it competes. And Monday, after a long and 
deliberate process, Clorox announced that it was acquiring the First 
Brands Corp., which is based in Danbury, Conn., and makes Glad trash 
bags, STP car care products and yes, three kinds of kitty litter. 
The $1.52 billion stock deal catapults Clorox to the top of the market 
in all three categories, the last of which is a high-margin business 
if there ever was one. The deal will add STP to Clorox's Armor-All, 
the car protectant maker it bought about a year ago, pushing the company 
to the top spot in car care products. And Clorox, based in Oakland, 
Calif., will be No. 1 in another category: plastic bags and plastic 
wrap, where analysts estimate Glad has 30 percent of the market. The 
announcement was happy news for First Brands shareholders, who had 
been sitting morosely on the sidelines while share prices in other 
consumer-products companies soared. The share price leaped $12.375 
Monday, to close at $36. ``If you were a First Brands shareholder, 
you would be nothing but euphoric today because for the last three 
years you've wanted to throw yourself out of a window,'' said Andrew 
Shore, a managing director and consumer products analyst at Paine 
Webber, adding that the share price last Friday of $24.625 wasn't 
even $1 above what it was at the end of 1995. People who bought the 
stock at that time, he said, ``basically made no money through one 
of the greatest bull markets in the history of the planet.'' The boards 
of both companies approved the deal, in which First Brands shareholders 
will receive Clorox stock equal to $39 for each share of First Brands. 
Clorox will also take on $440 million in First Brands debt. Clorox 
stock dipped a little in early trading but closed at $104, up $4.25. 
Analysts said the acquisition would make Clorox a major contender 
against companies like Colgate-Palmolive, give it an important foothold 
in international markets and propel some languishing First Brands 
names forward. ``They paid a full price for it,'' Shore said, ``but 
they've provided themselves a nice earnings cushion. This gives them 
an enormous amount of scale in the U.S. and overseas.'' Carol Warner 
Wilke, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said: ``It makes sense 
from a product standpoint, and Clorox will now gain some exposure 
in international markets. Clorox is great at managing their strong 
brands, and when you're in consumer products, that's the name of the 
game.'' For example, she said, the home-cleaning products division 
grew 17 percent in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30. ``They keep 
finding ways through new products and creative, innovative ways to 
educate the consumers that grow these businesses,'' she said. ``We 
don't see any reason why that would not continue.'' Amy Low Chasen 
of Goldman, Sachs said: ``Clorox is extremely focused. When they do 
something, they do it right.'' Sullivan, Clorox's chief executive, 
called the combination of companies ``a very good strategic fit'' 
and added that international growth was a key motive. ``Glad has about 
23 percent of its business outside the U.S.,'' he said, ``and we set 
a goal that we wanted 20 percent of our sales outside the U.S. by 
2000. We crossed 18 percent last year, and we are well on our way 
to that goal.'' Despite some turmoil in Latin America and Asia, he 
said, ``on a long-term basis we think you've got to be international.'' 
The new company expects to trim about $90 million in annual costs 
as a result of the deal, but no one seemed to know Monday whether 
that would mean substantial layoffs. Sullivan said it would take until 
the first quarter of next year to determine how the two companies' 
operations would work together. ``All those issues are unresolved,'' 
said Paul L. Stansel, manager of corporate communications and human 
resources at First Brands. However, he added, ``The mood is cautiously 
optimistic.''
