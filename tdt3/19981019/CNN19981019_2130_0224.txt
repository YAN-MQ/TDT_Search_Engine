Tropical storm Madeline is expected to weaken as it heads toward the 
western coast of Mexico. The national weather service predicts Madeline 
will make landfall within the next 24 hours about 75 miles northwest 
of mazatlan. The Mexican government has sent 2,000 soldiers and shipments 
of aid supplies to the area. Hurricane Lester no longer is a threat 
to southern Mexico. It's moving out to sea. A hurricane watch from 
acapulco to punta San telma has been canceled. We'll have the extended 
forecast in just a couple of minutes.
