A Spanish judge is broadening his arrest warrant for Chile's former 
dictator augusto Pinochet. Charges will now include genocide, torture 
and terrorism involving 94 people, including Spanish citizens and 
people of other nationalities. The former dictator was arrested in 
Britain over the weekend, and Spain is seeking to have him extradited. 
Pinochet supporters protested outside the British ambassador's residence 
in chile over the weekend. Chile meanwhile has sent a delegation to 
London to argue for Pinochet's release. Pinochet, now 82 years old, 
ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990, and still wields strong political power.
