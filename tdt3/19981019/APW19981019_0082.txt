An assailant threw two hand grenades into the central bus station 
in this desert town during morning rush hour Monday, and at least 
30 people were injured by the blasts, witnesses and radio reports 
said. One of the injured was in serious condition. The assailant, 
apparently an Arab, was caught by passers-by who wrestled him to the 
ground and handed him to police. The attack coincided with a make-or-break 
Mideast peace summit at Wye plantation outside Washington. A key issue 
on the agenda is Israel's demand that the Palestinians do more to 
prevent terror attacks in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu has said he will not hand over West Bank land until he receives 
ironclad guarantees from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Israel 
radio said Netanyahu was woken up by aides and briefed about the attack. 
The blasts went off shortly after 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) in the central 
bus station of Beersheba, a town in the southern Negev Center. Israeli 
radio reports said at least 30 people were injured and received treatment 
at Sorokka Hospital in Beersheba. Most suffered minor injuries. Paramedics 
from the Magen David Adom emergency service said at least one person 
was in serious condition. There was no immediately claim of responsibility. 
Israel has been on high alert for a possible terror attack for the 
past month after the Islamic militant group Hamas said it would carry 
out bombings in Israel. Hamas wants to avenge the killings of two 
Hamas top fugitives by Israeli troops in September.
