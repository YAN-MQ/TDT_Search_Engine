Stymied by persistent rain, authorities searched in vain Monday for 
three children swept away by flood waters during weekend storms that 
killed 14 people in Central Texas. Nearly a fourth of the state, or 
60 counties, have been hit by flooding, authorities said, with thousands 
of people forced to evacuate their homes. The worst damage occurred 
along a hilly, 90-mile stretch of Texas running between San Antonio 
and Austin and reaching east to Houston. As officials readied disaster-relief 
requests for the federal government, the continuing rain hampered 
their efforts to clean up the damage and assess its cost. ``I've been 
here 15 years, and I've never seen anything like this,'' said Mark 
Hanna, chief deputy of the Caldwell County sheriff's department, which 
was scrambling to cope with the flooding. Two of the missing children 
had been passengers in a Chevrolet Suburban that was washed from a 
low bridge Saturday in Caldwell County. The driver, who was not identified, 
was able to grab a log and paddle to safety with her 5-year-old son. 
But an 11-year-old girl, described as a family friend, and a 7-year-old 
boy were washed away with the vehicle, which was feared submerged 
in waters that in some places were 30 feet deep. Also missing was 
a 6-year-old boy who was swept from his grandfather's grasp at about 
noon on Saturday in Comal County, south of Austin, said Sheriff Bob 
Holder. Holder said the boy's family had been trying to escape from 
their car, stalled on a rural road northeast of New Braunfels. ``The 
water here rose so fast,'' the sheriff said. ``In 15 minutes it was 
a world of difference.'' Attempts to search for the children by air 
were hampered by the rain. ``It's a rural area where the child was 
lost, and it's very hard to get in with any equipment,'' Holder said. 
``What we're going to have to do is wait for the water to recede and 
get some people on the ground to physically walk down the area where 
the water went.'' The continuing bad weather also led Gov. George 
W. Bush to cancel a tour of the flood-ravaged areas Monday. ``It was 
only three months ago that we were praying for rain,'' said Bush. 
``And now, we've got too much rain.'' Heavy rains over the weekend 
soaked an area from San Antonio to Austin, and from to Houston and 
Victoria. On Sunday, the heaviest rains shifted toward Victoria. In 
Cuero, which is southeast of San Antonio, residents were being urged 
to evacuate, or at least pay close attention to the Guadalupe River, 
which was already 3 feet over the record flood level of 40 feet. It 
was rising at a rate of 6 inches every 15 minutes, said Jo Schweikhard 
Moss, a spokeswoman for the Texas Division of Emergency Management. 
Record flooding was also being predicted by the National Weather Service 
along the Colorado River. It was expected to crest at 31 or 32 feet 
at Smithville, with a new record of up to 46 feet at La Grange. The 
state received disaster declaration requests Sunday from Comal and 
Hays counties and the cities of Austin, San Marcos and New Braunfels, 
officials said. Of the 14 deaths over the weekend, 12 were related 
to the floods and two were the result of tornadoes, Ms. Moss said. 
Since Saturday about 7,000 people have been evacuated, with 5,300 
of those seeking refuge in shelters in 51 locations. The San Antonio 
area, which was deluged with 20 inches of rain in a 24-hour period, 
was under a state of emergency Monday. Cleanup was being hampered 
by continued rain. Looting was reported in both San Antonio and Comal 
County. ``We're ready for a break,'' said Holder, the Comal sheriff, 
who said as much as 15.5 inches of rain was reported in his county 
on Saturday. Businesses and homes along the Guadalupe were devastated, 
he said. ``It looks like a tornado came through here,'' he said. ``All 
that's left are the cement foundations.'' East of Houston, a section 
of Interstate 10 was closed Monday morning at the San Jacinto bridge, 
after a barge that broke free of its moorings hit the bridge, crumbling 
a piling. It was reopened later in the day.
