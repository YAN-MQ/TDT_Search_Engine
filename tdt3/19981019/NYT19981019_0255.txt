NATIONAL FORECAST Autumnal weather will extend from the upper Great 
Lakes to the Northeast on Tuesday. A reinforcing shot of cool air 
will follow a cold front pushing south through New England. Brisk 
winds from the northwest will further enhance the chill. Patchy showers 
will form downwind from Lakes Superior, Erie and Ontario. Wet snowflakes 
will mix with the rain in the higher elevations of northern New England. 
Meanwhile, sinking air currents will promote a sunny and pleasant 
day with seasonal temperatures from the middle Atlantic coast to the 
Ohio Valley. Cooler air will arrive Tuesday night. A stream of only 
moderately moist air will accompany a cold front moving through the 
Southeast. The result will be plenty of clouds but limited showers 
from the central Gulf coast to the Carolinas. The front will stall 
across the western Gulf of Mexico. Unsettled weather will prevail 
from Texas to the southern Rockies. Humid air from the east will result 
in clouds and areas of rain from the lower Rio Grande Valley to western 
Texas. However, the axis of heaviest rain will shift away from the 
water-logged parts of eastern Texas. As the moist air ascends the 
sloping terrain, clouds and rain will expand over New Mexico, southern 
Colorado, and the mountains of northern Arizona. Tranquil weather 
will cover most of the northern Rockies and Pacific states as sprawling 
high pressure brings ample sunshine. Although some morning low clouds 
and fog will begin the day along the southern California coast and 
interior Northwest, the afternoon will turn mostly sunny. Focus: Waning 
Season Hurricane warnings were posted for the Pacific coast of Mexico 
on Sunday as Hurricanes Lester and Madeline loomed offshore. Meanwhile, 
in the Atlantic Ocean, clusters of showers, the seedlings for tropical 
storms, were battling for survival. By late October, hurricane season 
is rapidly winding down in the Atlantic. Cooling seas and strengthening 
high-altitude winds conspire to inhibit tropical cyclone formation. 
Only 41 tropical storms have formed during the last 10 days of October 
since 1886. On Tuesday, a disturbance in the northwest Caribbean Sea 
will struggle to become a tropical depression.
