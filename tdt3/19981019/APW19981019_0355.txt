The daughter of the late President Salvador Allende said Monday that 
the arrest of former Chilean strongman Augusto Pinochet _ the man 
who overthrew her father _ was a lesson for future dictators. ``It's 
not revenge,'' said Isabel Allende, three days after British police 
detained the former leader. ``It signifies that when you speak of 
genocide, of state terrorism, there are no borders. ``It's a day of 
triumph for democracy and human rights,'' she said in an interview 
with France 2 television. ``It's a lesson for the future ... that 
a dictator cannot commit crimes with impunity.'' Pinochet ousted Allende 
in a bloody coup in 1973, when the Marxist leader committed suicide 
before he could be captured. During 17 years of rule, Pinochet has 
been widely accused of running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances 
and deaths of political opponents. On Friday, British police detained 
Pinochet in London, where he was recovering from back surgery. Spain 
is seeking his extradition, though the Chilean government has protested 
his arrest. Ms. Allende, who became a Socialist member of the Chilean 
parliament after returning to her homeland in 1990, said she was happy 
with the arrest for ``all the families of political prisoners who 
disappeared.''
