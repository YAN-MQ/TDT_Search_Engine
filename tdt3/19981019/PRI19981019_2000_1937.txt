British Prime Minister Tony Blair has held talks in London to try 
to pave the way toward disarming Northern Ireland's paramilitary groups. 
The issue is blocking progress between the parties in the peace process. 
Afterwards, leader of Northern Ireland's largest party, David Trimble 
of the mainly Protestant Ulster Unionist, said it was up to Sein Fein 
and the Republicans to make the first move. The inability of the Republican 
movement to deliver on its side of the bargain is causing difficulty 
and the difficulty will get greater until such a point actually as 
that everybody's going to have to look closely at how best we can 
proceed if one party is failing to honor its obligations. But Mr. 
Blair was told by a senior Sein Fein figure, Martin McGuinness, that 
the disagreement should not prevent progress.
