After Piper Aircraft emerged from bankruptcy three years ago, company 
president Chuck Suma made some bold predictions. By 2000, he said, 
the company would produce 400 aircraft a year, employ as many as 800 
people and have annual sales up to dlrs 150 million. Pretty lofty 
aspirations considering Piper was just a shadow of the industry powerhouse 
it had once been. In the 1970s, the Vero Beach-based company had 8,000 
employees churning out 18 planes a day _ even keeping 450 extra aircraft 
tied down outside waiting for buyers. By the time Piper sought protection 
from creditors in 1991, its work force had shrunk to 45. Yearly _ 
not daily _ production was down to 14 planes. Power was turned off, 
buildings locked up. There was no cash in the bank. ``There were some 
pretty bleak days,'' Suma recalled. Not any more. The New Piper Aircraft 
Inc. _ the company created by a dlrs 95 million sale to bring it out 
of bankruptcy _ has actually exceeded some expectations with a more 
conservative business philosophy under new owners, Philadelphia investment 
group Dimeling, Schreiber and Park, Teledyne Industries Inc. and creditors. 
Two years shy of the original projections, Piper has beefed up its 
work force to 953 employees, projected dlrs 128 million in revenue 
and sold 303 aircraft this year. More than 90 orders have been placed 
for its new Malibu Meridian, a dlrs 1.3 million single-engine turboprop 
unveiled in September. Suma says the solution is simple: You need 
more money coming in than going out. ``If you go back to 1991, it's 
a great feeling,'' Suma said. ``I think we're doing a lot better than 
we all set our goals for.'' Still, he knows to take measured steps. 
Suma grew up just two miles (3 kms) from the Vero Beach airport, where 
Piper has 1.2 million square feet (110,000 sq. meters) of air-conditioned 
factories and offices. As a teen-ager, he fueled planes. He joined 
Piper in 1976 as an aircraft assembler. It was the heyday of the company, 
founded in 1937 in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, but there was waste. 
Planes were built on speculation and were tied down outside the factory 
until they were matched by color, stripe and radio to a customer's 
request. Too many had to be sold at bargain prices, Suma said. ``It's 
a lot of money to tie up,'' he said. As Suma rose in the company, 
the U.S. economy turned sour. And product-liability lawsuits dogged 
Piper. Production and profits declined until July 3, 1991, when the 
company sought federal bankruptcy protection. ``The lack of financial 
planning _ that was the biggest mistake,'' Suma said. As he reflected 
on the past, he was momentarily distracted by what he hopes is the 
future: a prototype of the Malibu Meridian revving its engine on a 
test run just outside his office. ``That's a very distinctive sound,'' 
Suma said, with a proud smile. ``It sounds like a million-three airplane.'' 
The unveiling of the Meridian marked Piper's return to the turbine-powered 
aircraft market _ a market abandoned before bankruptcy when it stopped 
production of its Cheyenne series. Piper hopes the new line will attract 
more customers with deeper pockets. The previous high-end Piper was 
the dlrs 800,000 Malibu Mirage. Pipers start at dlrs 139,000. The 
Meridian won't be available until mid-2000. In Piper's brightly lit 
factories, employees are buzzing. At least a third of the work force 
is made up of pre-bankruptcy employees. ``They made it a point to 
say 'You will not be forgotten,''' said tour guide Bob Phillip. ``They're 
still calling some back.'' Phillip worked for Piper from 1960 until 
his retirement in 1991. But he and several other former members of 
management returned in 1995 as tour guides. Twice a week, they share 
their insight during a tour that covers more than a mile (1.6 kms). 
``Everybody's just as content as can be. They just like what they're 
doing,'' said Phillip, 71. ``The attitude in the plant is very inspiring 
with the new company.'' Mike Boyd, president of The Boyd Group, an 
Evergreen, Colorado-based aviation consulting group, also has been 
impressed by Piper's turnaround. It was something he never expected. 
He supports Piper's decision to return to the turbine-engine powered 
aircraft market, calling it ``the wave of the future.'' He knows orders 
already have been placed. ``It says they've got products they can 
sell in a marketplace that wants to buy them,'' Boyd said. ``I don't 
see a great deal of downside for the company. I see a very strong 
future for something like a Piper.''
