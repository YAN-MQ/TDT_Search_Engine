The late Florence Griffith Joyner put in a lifetime of hard work to 
reach her goals, and the accomplishments didn't stop when she died. 
A line of athletic shoes and clothes that she had been working on 
will be introduced as planned, her husband announced Monday. Griffith 
Joyner, Olympic gold medalist and holder of world records in the 100 
and 200 meters, died Sept. 21 in her sleep at her home in Mission 
Viejo. She was 38. There has been speculation that Griffith Joyner 
may have had unsuspected heart problems, but results of an investigation 
into the cause of death were still pending Monday, said Lt. Hector 
Rivera, a spokesman for the county sheriff and coroner. Al Joyner, 
the 1984 Olympic triple jump champion, said his wife had been working 
since last year on the ``FGJ'' collection, participating in every 
step of the design process. The line was scheduled to appear at Lady 
Foot Locker stores in mid-November. A portion of the sale proceeds 
will go to the non-profit Florence Griffith Joyner Memorial Empowerment 
Foundation to continue helping children around the world, he said. 
``Florence had long dreamed of having her own signature line,'' Joyner 
said. ``As with everything in her life, she put a tremendous amount 
of time, energy and passion into making this line a success. By continuing 
the work she started, we are adding to her legacy.''
