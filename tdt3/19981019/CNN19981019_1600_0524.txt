This look at your "Headline News weather" begins with our forecast 
for high temperatures on Tuesday. And you can see, very chilly weather 
will continue behind the cold front, the very strong cold front that's 
been bringing all of the heavy rainfall into southeastern Texas. Now, 
as you look at the forecast weather map, you can clearly see that 
frontal boundary not moving very much, but we do expect an improving 
weather picture as we go through the day on Tuesday. The rain showers, 
however, may still threaten parts of the flooded areas of southeastern 
Texas, as you can clearly see on this map. Much of the rest of the 
nation will see dry weather, look for a few showers in the very chilly 
air in the upper midwest. In your extended forecast on Wednesday, 
showers move through the Great Lakes area, and you can see the very 
cold air associated with that. Moving on into the latter part of the 
week, rainfall in parts of the northeast and the southwest, cool throughout 
much of the east. And as we head on into Friday, you can see the cool 
weather continues in the east, and much of the nation will be dry.
