In Texas, 14 people are dead after a weekend of heavy rains and high 
winds. Water levels on some rivers in the southern part of the state 
are still rising. Eric horng reports. Parts of southeast Texas remain 
under water after heavy rains cut a 200-mile swath of watery devastation. 
This is the wettest month San Antonio has ever recorded. From the 
air, parts of town look like swampland. On the ground, rescue boats 
cruise through snake-infested waters, moving people to higher ground. 
Since Saturday, more than 400 people in the San Antonio area alone 
have been rescued from their vehicles. And even some of those doing 
the rescuing have had to call for help as well. Get on the truck. 
They'll hopefully send out another truck. Yeah, they're coming out 
to get us. 90 miles away, near Austin, streets have all, but disappeared, 
swallowed by nearby creeks and rivers. You see that fence over there. 
How tall it is? We just went over a fence just like that right here. 
But people aren't the only ones affected by the floods. In Bastrop 
county, a horse struggles to stay afloat. Rescuers speed to the scene 
to save the animal which is caught on a Submerged fence. And in comal 
county, a TV news helicopter captures a bizarre sight. A cow perched 
atop the roof of a house. But there's very little people here haven't 
seen. Their bodies and spirits soaked by rains that forecasters say 
will likely continue for at least one more day. Eric horng, CNN.
