Jerome Jurenovich, "Headline Sports." 15 months after biting Evander 
Holyfield's ears, Mike Tyson has been granted a new boxing license, 
although not without a warning from the nevada state athletic commission. 
This will indeed be your last chance. Mike, you must take responsibility 
for yourself and act like the champion you once were. You will either 
conduct yourself in accordance with our rules and regulations or you 
will probably never fight again in Nevada. I'm just thankful that 
these people gave me the opportunity to employ my skills again.
