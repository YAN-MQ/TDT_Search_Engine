It's every student's nightmare. You've studied hard for the biggest 
exam of the semester. But when the time comes to take the test, suddenly 
you've forgotten everything you learned. Researchers say there's a 
reason for that. A hormone called cortisol interferes with your long-term 
memory. And cortisol can be triggered by stress. This effect only 
lasts for a couple of hours, so that the impairing effect in this 
case is temporary impairment of retrieval. The memory is not lost. 
It is just inaccessible or less accessible for a period of time. What 
can be done to prevent it? If it's a test or another event you're 
worried about, become familiar with the location ahead of time. And 
there are general techniques to help you relax during any stressful 
situation. Try slow breathing or close your eyes and imagine a calm 
place.
