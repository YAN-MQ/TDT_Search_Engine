And you're listening to VOA News Now. I'm Elizabeth Tharat along with 
Steve Norman. It's universal time. In Music News this week, it's strange 
but true, thanks to technology that is, the late Elvis Presley will 
embark on his first world tour. American singer/songwriter Jewel has 
finished a new CD and is working on her second book. And, it seems 
like U2 band member, Bono, can't find enough to do these days. All 
of that. VOA's Katherine Cole has details.
