Squaring off in their fourth and final debate, Gov. John Rowland and 
his opponent, Rep. Barbara Kennelly, each took a strong party stance 
on Monday night, with the governor charging Mrs. Kennelly with recycling 
tired Democratic themes while she continued her charge that he was 
ignoring the state's neediest citizens. In her opening statement, 
Mrs. Kennelly repeated her theme of the previous two debates, that 
Connecticut was becoming two states, and that Rowland was only concerned 
with the prosperous half of the state. In Rowland's vision of Connecticut, 
she said, ``everybody has a great job, everybody can see still the 
doctor of their choice, every child is well-educated and protected, 
and our environment is pristine. But you know and I know that's not 
all true,'' she told the audience at Connecticut College. Rowland 
shot back that Mrs. Kennelly represented the past and accused her 
of stealing a theme from a speech by the former New York governor, 
Mario Cuomo. ``Some of the same old rhetoric and some of the old, 
borrowed ideas are come back to haunt us,'' Rowland said. ``I believe 
this campaign is about the rhetoric versus the record. Even the rhetoric 
was borrowed. The `Tale of Two Cities' in Mrs. Kennelly's opening 
remarks, and `The Tale of Two Cities' in the last debate, was Mario 
Cuomo's idea in 1984, during the Democratic National Convention _ 
the exact same rhetoric.'' In the most tense exchange of Monday's 
debate, the candidates were asked to name the groups that had made 
the largest contributions to their campaign. Mrs. Kennelly charged 
the governor with deliberately undermining her fund-raising. ``Not 
too many groups make large campaign contributions to my campaign,'' 
she said. ``I can remember I was told when I first was going to run 
that, you know, `The usual people will give to you. The lobbyists 
_ they'll give you a lot of money at the beginning.' But of course 
the governor made the word go out very quickly: `This election, you 
don't give to both candidates. You give to me, or forget it.' And 
so a minute number of lobbyists gave to me.'' The governor ignored 
that charge in the debate. Later, his spokesman, Dean Pagani, said 
it was false. During the debate, Rowland started his answer to the 
question about donors, by saying, ``The largest group that has contributed 
to my campaign? The taxpayers of the state _ the people in this community 
that believe that we've turned the state around over the last four 
years.'' One of the panelists pressed for a more specific answer, 
asking the candidates wheher they had received any significant contribution 
from a particular business or special-interest group. Mrs. Kennelly 
said she had contributions from several labor unions, and ``thousands 
and thousands of contributions from individuals who just want to see 
me be the governor.'' Rowland, whose campaign has been heavily financed 
by business groups, said, ``There's no particular quote-unquote group.'' 
The audience of 1,000, which seemed to be heavy with partisans of 
Mrs. Kennelly, groaned and cackled. Mrs. Kennelly interrupted. ``Oh, 
come on!'' she scolded the governor, chuckling and shaking her head. 
The laughter built in the audience. ``You've got to tell your supporters 
to quiet down a little bit,'' the governor said. ``I know they must 
be getting frustrated.'' Mrs. Kennelly leaned toward her rostrum and 
continued shaking her head. The candidates also squared off over the 
privatization of state services, an issue that was not discussed in 
their earlier debates. Rowland said he was privatizing state computer 
systems, a change he said would improve government services and make 
them more inexpensive. But Mrs. Kennelly raised concerns that a privatized 
system would compromise privacy. Mrs. Kennelly also said the state 
had failed to do enough for crime victims. She applauded the creation 
of an office to oversee the rights of crime victims, but she said 
state officials had failed to inform many crime victims of court appearances. 
``It is becoming very quickly an office that has the right idea, but 
it isn't being run with the greatest efficiency and excitement,'' 
she said.
