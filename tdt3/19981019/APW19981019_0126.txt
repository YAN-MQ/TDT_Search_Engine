About 100 students protested near the presidential palace Monday, 
demanding that some of Indonesia's oil profits be returned to their 
province of Riau on Sumatra Island. ``We want President B.J. Habibie 
to fulfill his promise to return 10 percent of the money taken from 
our oil-rich province,'' said a spokesman for the protesters, who 
identified himself only as Andi. Dozens of security personnel pushed 
away the protesters as they marched from the National Monument northward 
toward the palace. The protesters then marched about three kilometers 
(2 miles) to the office of the Legal Aid Foundation. The protesters, 
who called their group the Communication Forum of Riau Students, claimed 
that Habibie, who succeeded autocratic leader Suharto in May, has 
pledged to share earnings from natural resources between the central 
government and provincial governments. Many groups have complained 
that during past decades, natural resources in the provinces have 
been unfairly exploited by the central government and certain well-connected 
groups. Suharto resigned amid a crippling economic crisis and widespread 
student protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
