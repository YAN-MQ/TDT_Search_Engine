After the quickest negotiations in postwar German history, the Social 
Democrats and Greens are ready to sign a coalition pact that paves 
the way for Germany's first center-left government in 16 years. After 
a final round of talks to nail down Cabinet posts, both sides described 
the deal late Monday as sealed after just over two weeks of work. 
Details of who gets what job were to be released at a signing ceremony 
on Tuesday. But most of the positions were already known, including 
Greens leader and former peace activist Joschka Fischer as foreign 
minister and Oskar Lafontaine, leftist chairman of the Social Democrats, 
as head of a beefed-up Finance Ministry. The new government also was 
expected to include five female Cabinet members _ three more than 
outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition. Gunda Roestel, 
another Greens leader, called the pact ``good for women.'' The deal 
still must be approved at special party conventions this weekend before 
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder can be sworn in on Oct. 27 _ exactly 
one month after the election. Not included in the government is the 
political outsider Schroeder had wanted as his economics minister: 
Jost Stollmann. The millionaire computer entrepreneur backed out Monday, 
saying he was unhappy with plans to take European economic policy 
from his office and give it to the Finance Ministry. He also criticized 
the incoming government's left-leaning agenda, saying it would result 
in higher tax burdens on small firms and strayed from the business-friendly 
``new center'' approach Schroeder had campaigned on. ``This country 
needs a policy of modernization and renewal,'' he said. ``I hope that 
Schroeder will be able to push through his ideas of the `new center' 
because that is the right kind of policy.'' Schroeder played down 
Stollmann's complaints, saying that as future chancellor, he had to 
take a bigger picture view of government policy. He also insisted 
Stollmann's departure did not mean he was abandoning the political 
middle. ``If the `new center' consisted of just one person, that'd 
be underrating it,'' Schroeder said.
