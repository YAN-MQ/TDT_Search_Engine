Two major explosions are also on the news today. In southern Nigeria, 
rescue workers say at least 400 people burned to death Sunday in a 
huge gas line/pipeline explosion. Hundreds more were reported hospitalized. 
VOA's John Pitman is monitoring developments from our West Africa 
bureau in Abijan. The explosion and fire occurred on Sunday near the 
town of Warrey about 300 kilometers southwest of Lagos. On Monday, 
hospital officials put the death toll at close to 500 but that number 
is expected to rise. It remains unclear exactly how the fire started, 
although some witnesses say a spark from a cigarette or a motorcycle's 
exhaust may have ignited the blaze. The victims were burned while 
collecting gasoline spilled from a damaged pipeline. Nigerian petroleum 
officials have said they believe the pipeline was sabotaged. However, 
no one has claimed responsibility for the damage. Eyewitnesses say 
the fire trapped dozens of people in an area about the size of a football 
field, where the spilled gasoline had collected in a pool. Local news 
reports say most of the victims were women and children. John Pitman,
