Chilean tennis player Marcelo Rios has won his seventh tournament 
of the year as he beat Australian Mark Woodford, six/four, six/two 
in the finals of the Singapore Open in China. David Luddy has more 
in this report. Rios beats 33 year old veteran Mark Woodford, six/four, 
six/two to win his seventh title of the year. He outclassed the Australian 
in front of a capacity house of 6,000 fans. His firepower of penetrating 
shots and angles in this battle of left handers was really just an 
indoor exhibition for the man from Chile, now likely to take over 
the world number two spot this Monday. Twenty-two year old Rios, who 
briefly held the number one ranking this year, had cruised through 
the week, dropping only one set in the court of finals of this Heineken 
Open to 17 year old Australian, Lathan Hewitt. But with the early 
defeats of Michael Chang and then Goren Ivanisovich, beaten by Woodford 
in the earlier rounds, this was his easiest title of the year. David 
Luddy, VOA Sports, Singapore.
