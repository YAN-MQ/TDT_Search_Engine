Elvis Presley has been dead for more than 20 years now but that's 
not keeping him from going out on his first tour outside of North 
America. Billboard Magazine is reporting that Elvis the Concert will 
hit Europe next year. This is a production that reunites Presley's 
former band mates on stage with a video projected image of the late 
singer. The extravaganza is booked into London's Wembley Arena on 
January 23rd and after that, the high tech event heads to Belgium, 
Germany, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway before wrapping up in 
early February. Elvis the Concert is expected to hit Australia and 
Asia later in 1999. I'm Katherine Cole.
