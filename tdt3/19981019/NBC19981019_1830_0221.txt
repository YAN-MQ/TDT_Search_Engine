Can that part of the world ever know lasting peace? How many times 
in the last 40 years have we opened this news program with the proclamation, 
"there is new hope for peace in the Middle East tonight"? And every 
time, the hope has given way to more war or terror or major disagreements. 
So tonight, NBC's Martin Fletcher in Tel Aviv with the "nightly question," 
"Is peace possible?" For both men seeking peace today, the odds of 
a lasting success are a long shot. "How can you talk peace," right-wingers 
are asking prime minister Netanyahu after today's grenade attack, 
"with blood running in the streets?" They are demanding Netanyahu 
return home immediately. Netanyahu needs the right wing. Their votes 
made the difference in the last election, and he faces the voters 
again in two years. If he cuts a deal with Arafat in Washington, the 
right wing keeps warning netanyahu they'll topple him. We will not 
sit idly by. The same people that put him in government will However, 
all topple him. Opinion polls show 80% of Israelis want the peace 
process to continue. Netanyahu's dilemma, how to make peace and stay 
in power? To do that, he's raised the bar, making tough security demands 
on Yasser arafat, trying to show We want a real peace. And you wonder 
whether Netanyahu wants peace at all. On the other side of the table, 
Yasser Arafat confronts his own dilemma. He doesn't face an election 
problem, he faces civil war. Today, the leader of the Islamic militants 
Hamas warned that regardless of the peace talks, his men will continue 
to fight Israel. And Israeli and American intelligence sources agree 
Yassin has ordered his fighters to begin a terror campaign much worse 
than anything seen before. Tonight, in the Middle East with a grenade 
attack fresh in people's minds, the chances of the two leaders setting 
aside their differences to seek a Lasting peace seems Slim. Martin 
Fletcher, NBC news, Tel Aviv.
