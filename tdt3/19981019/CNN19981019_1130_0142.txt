The federal antitrust suit against Microsoft is going to trial today 
in U.S. district court in Washington. Rusty Dornin reports, the outcome 
of the case could affect millions of computer users. What you see 
is what you get. Nine out of ten people who get a personal computer 
see Microsoft windows on their screen. They have a large invasive 
monopoly. It's hard for the public to understand, but if the government 
doesn't step in, consumer choice will be eradicated. Lack of choice 
is one of the reasons government prosecutors say they are going after 
the software giant. They claim Microsoft controls too much of our 
cyberworld. Unfairly and illegally. Is the whole question of innovation 
ensuring that the right incentives are available in the market, so 
America's companies will innovate in this critical market in terms 
of our economy. Innovation say Microsoft executives is exactly why 
their company is so healthy. They say that's what free enterprise 
is all about. The government will use the companies own internal memos 
and E-mail as evidence accusing Microsoft of bribing, bullying and 
trying to force people to use their products. We don't agree with 
those stories. What's important is to look at consumers, and ask them 
about Microsoft. Ask them about the products, and what you find is 
a great deal of support. The big beef started with Internet browsers. 
The government claims Microsoft pushed out competitors by bundling 
its browsers in Windows 98. Microsoft says its main competitor made 
poor business moves and shot itself in the foot. Critics worry Microsoft 
could end up controlling things like online banking, buying tickets 
for travel and entertainment to name a few, not to mention controlling 
the lucrative market for software. All of us who have companies of 
significance who are threatened by microsoft would certainly encourage 
the kind of competitive environment that would challenge Microsoft. 
Microsoft says government prosecutors have more than one agenda. There's 
no doubt that the department of justice is trying to drift this lawsuit 
into other areas. The trial could last six weeks or more. If the government 
wins the case, it raises the possibility, however remote, of a breakup 
of the software giant. Rusty Dornin, CNN, San Francisco.
