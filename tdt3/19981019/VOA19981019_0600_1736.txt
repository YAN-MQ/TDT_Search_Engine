Chastity Bono says she never got a chance to heel a rift with her 
father before he died. Chastity is the daughter of entertainer Cher 
and her late ex-husband and former partner, Sonny Bono. Mr. Bono, 
and entertainer turned U. S. Congressman, died in January in a skiing 
accident. His daughter, who is a lesbian, is an author and activist 
for homosexual rights here in the United States. Chastity Bono says 
she and her father had a serious disagreement over her co-sponsorship 
of the defense of marriage act, an effort in Congress to outlaw gay 
marriages. She says it put what she calls a tremendous amount of distance 
between us. That is Sonny Bono. He died last year in a horrible skiing 
accident.
