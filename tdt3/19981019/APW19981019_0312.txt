Striking employees at state-owned Air Algerie reached an agreement 
with management Monday to end their two-week-old walkout, officials 
said. The accord, which the unions called ``a good compromise,'' calls 
for a 15 percent pay raise, officials said. Management still vowed 
to hold to a restructuring plan. The walkout paralyzed domestic and 
international flights the first week, though the airline managed to 
resume about half its schedule since then.
