In Nigeria today, the death toll continues to climb from last Saturday's 
gas line fire while late today more than 300 people had died and the 
number of injured is still unknown. NPR's Charlene Hunter Gault filed 
this report from the scene. After three days the fire is still burning 
but as of now it's now threat to anyone. Most of the charred remains 
of the victims have been claimed by relatives and the few that remain 
scattered around the cinged ground and bush were buried late today 
in a nearby mass grave. Earlier Nigerian ruler General Abu Salam Abubaka 
visited the site and said he was saddened by what he saw. He also 
said he realized there was a scarcity of oil in the country, but that 
it made no sense to vandalize the pipeline that is trying to deliver 
what little there is to the people. I'm Charlene Hunter Gault, NPR 
news, Jedsi, Nigeria.
