Hundreds of pages of the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against 
the president were made public today. Tony Clark reports what may 
be most interesting is what was not released. In the 724 pages of 
previously secret court documents, attorneys for Paula Jones repeatedly 
pressed President Clinton to give them the name, address and telephone 
number of every individual other than his wife with whom he has had 
sexual relations since 1986. Each time, Clinton objected, saying -- 
"the questions were intended solely to harass, embarrass and humiliate 
the president and the office he occupies." The rationale behind it 
would have been to attack his character, to show that this is a guy 
who really is a sexual predator. When the judge forced the president 
to answer whether he'd ever had sexual relations, not only with a 
state employee but also with a Federal employee, he said he'd had 
none. Monica Lewinsky went along with the deception. While fighting 
to keep from testifying, she said in an affidavit that was also among 
the documents released, that she had not had sexual relations with 
the president. Later, in a deal with special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, 
she admitted having sexual relations. But what impact would that have 
on the Jones' case? The question is, did he harass Paula Jones? And 
if he took some sort of action, did it subjectively alter the conditions 
of her work environment? That's the only thing she's got going for 
her, because there was no tangible loss-of-job benefits. Arkansas 
state trooper Danny Ferguson, a co-defendant in the lawsuit, is quoted 
in the documents as claiming -- it was Jones and not Mr. clinton who 
initiated the Little Rock hotel meeting. And Ferguson denied helping 
procure women for Mr. Clinton. Judge Susan Webber Wright threw out 
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit in april, but decided to make the 
documents public following president clinton's admission that he was 
less than candid in his answers to Jones' attorneys. President Clinton's 
deposition as well as the deposition by Paula Jones were not part 
of the documents made public Monday. The judge said she doesn't even 
have a complete copy of the president's deposition. More documents 
are to be made public next week. Tony Clark, CNN, Little Rock.
