Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has opened preliminary takeover 
talks with Bankers Trust, according to a report Tuesday in the Financial 
Times. The possible deal, which would require the approval of the 
U.S. Federal Reserve and banking regulators in New York, would be 
the largest takeover of a U.S. bank by a non-U.S. bank, the newspaper 
said, adding that any announcement of any deal is seen as being some 
way off. Bankers Trust, based in New York, is the eighth-largest bank 
holding company in the United States in terms of assets. The Financial 
Times said sources close to the talks, whom they did not name, stress 
the discussion is in its early stages, but that it is the ``key element'' 
of the German bank's efforts to acquire a leading U.S. investment 
bank. ``I would not call these offical talks, more exploratory talks,'' 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified person involved as saying. ``However, 
it looks like it may lead to that.'' The newspaper said both companies 
declined to comment Monday night. Senior executives at Deutsche Bank 
are said by Wall Street sources to recognize talks with Bankers Trust 
as offering the best hope of a takeover announcement before the end 
of the year, the newspaper said, adding that Bankers Trust would provide 
the German bank with a large-scale U.S. operation and U.S. clients.
