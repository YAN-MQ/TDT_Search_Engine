deforest Mutinous soldiers in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia 
have surrendered and agreed to return to their garrison after clashes 
with government troops. The revolt began early Monday when soldiers 
fiercely opposed to President Eduard Shevardnadze took over their 
garrison in the western town of Senake and advanced toward the heart 
of Georgia. The rebels blocked roads with stolen tanks, trucks and 
machine guns. Government troops poured into the area to defend it.
