it every day. But do you really know what's in there? Not everything. 
no. I never thought about it. My medicine cabinet? Well, it pays to 
take a good look in your medicine cabinet. You might be surprised

with an over-the-counter medication, altering the effectiveness or 
safety... of one or both of the drugs. So here are some tips... for 
you and your medicine cabinet. First, read the label for any warnings 
about drug interactions. Then get rid of all out-of-date medicines... 
and those you don't take anymore. Who needs 'em? And if you're one 
of the millions of people... who takes a prescription drug, remember, 
the pain reliever associated with the least risk... of drug interaction 
and side effects... is the medicine in Tylenol. So check out your 
medicine cabinet. Any questions? Check with your doctor or pharmacist.
