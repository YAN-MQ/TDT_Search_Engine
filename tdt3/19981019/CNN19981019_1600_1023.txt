The U.S. government and Microsoft squared off in court today. The 
government opened its landmark case with taped testimony of Microsoft 
chairman Bill Gates. Lawyers for the government argued that Microsoft 
illegally tried to divide the market for Internet browsers with rival 
Netscape communications. There are very serious allegations that have 
been raised here. The government apparently is prepared to prove that 
Microsoft has attempted to guide up markets, that's really an invitation 
to engage in cartel behavior. It's hard to imagine more serious antitrust 
charges. Shares of Microsoft ended the day down more than $200 nearly 
$103 a share.
