The Chilean government has dispatched a prominent diplomat to London, 
all of this in an effort to persuade British authorities to release 
former dictator Genoa Augusto Penechet from custody. As Jonathan Franklin 
reports from Santiago, the detention of the retired general has revived 
old wounds in the South American nation. The detention of former Chilean 
dictator, Augusto Penechet in London has shocked his countrymen back 
in Santiago. Both supporters and opponents of the former general reacted 
with disbelief of the news that Scotland Yard had placed the 82 year 
old strongman under arrest, pending his possible extradition to Spain. 
The charges against Penechet stem from an investigation carried out 
by two Spanish judges into the presumed murder of Spanish citizens 
during the Penechet dictatorship. An estimated 4,000 people were killed 
after 1973 when General Penechet led a military junta that overthrew 
the Marxist government of President Salvatore Ayende. News of the 
detention has already generated strong reaction. On Sunday, thousands 
of Penechet supporters marched on the home of the British Ambassador 
and also the Spanish embassy where they pelted it with eggs, clashed 
with riot police and were repeatedly drenched by water cannons. One 
of the prosecutors, Ilcie Karose, a 50 year old woman, told this reporter, 
"This is just the beginning. The reason you see so few people is that 
we are the working class, not like the Marxists and delinquents." 
Yet most of the demonstrators appeared to be relatively affluent with 
some carrying cell phones. At the same time, opponents of General 
Penechet marched on Santiago's Central Cemetery to hold a memorial 
service for the victims of the dictatorship. Their views on the former 
dictator were summed up by 20 year old university student Rodrigo 
Alvear who told this reporter, "He's an assassin. He deserves prison." 
Meanwhile, the Chilean government has sent a percent diplomat to London 
to urge British authorities to release the former dictator. Don Voy 
will argue that General Penechet is protected from arrest by diplomatic 
immunity. But Britain has rejected the claim, saying that a diplomatic 
passport does not shield him from questioning by a Spanish judge.
