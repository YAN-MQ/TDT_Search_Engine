Here in the United States, President Clinton is reported to have rejected 
a $2 million settlement proposal by Paula Jones to drop her sexual 
harassment lawsuit. Quoting unnamed sources close to those talks, 
the "Washington Post' newspaper says the Jones' legal team is expected 
to make another offer today. But the report says there is little optimism 
that a compromise can be reached before Tuesday when arguments are 
to be heard about whether the dismissed case should be reinstated.
