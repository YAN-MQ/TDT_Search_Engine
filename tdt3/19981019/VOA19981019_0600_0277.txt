The government and rebels in Guinea Bisau are accusing each other 
or responsibility for renewed fighting Sunday, the heaviest in nearly 
three months. Heavy arms fire erupted late Sunday and continued for 
two hours before tapering off. The government says fighting started 
at rebel held Vosaki barracks north of Bisau after rebels tried to 
infiltrate troops into a government held part of the city. The rebels 
say government troops shot flares and then began firing on rebel positions 
throughout the city.
