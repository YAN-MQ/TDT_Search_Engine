And a Mexican Zapatista rebel commander, Subcommander Marcos, is calling 
for a new round of peace talks in Chiapa state to settle a five year 
standoff with the government. A rebel statement released Sunday called 
for talks with the same congressional mediating commission that had 
brokered a limited autonomy deal that was later rejected by the government 
as unconstitutional. Imani Crosby, VOA News.
