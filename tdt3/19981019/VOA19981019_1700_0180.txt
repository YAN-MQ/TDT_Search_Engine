Twenty-four officers and soldiers convicted of taking part in Sierra 
Leone's 1997 military coupe have been executed in the capital Freetown. 
The executions were carried out one week after the military men were 
found guilty of treason by a military tribunal. VOA's John Pitman 
has details from our West Africa Bureau. The convicted soldiers and 
officers were executed by a firing squad Monday afternoon. The execution 
was open to the public and thousands reportedly turned out to see 
the former coup leaders die. Among those executed on Monday were the 
Army's former Chief of Staff Samuel Koroma. The military government's 
Secretary General Colonel Abdul Kareem Sesay and the coup leaders 
former spokesman Corporal Tambobori. The soldiers were convicted of 
treason a week ago for their roles in the 1997 coupes which ousted 
President Ahmad Tejan Kaba. Some of the defendants were also found 
guilty of murder, rape and arson. The executions coincided with another 
round of guilty verdicts from the court martial. On Monday, the court 
found an additional 16 people guilty of treason. They will also face 
the death penalty when they are sentenced. John Pitman, VOA News, 
West African Bureau.
