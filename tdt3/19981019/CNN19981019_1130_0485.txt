I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." A 
cool day over much of the midwest and extending back through the northern 
rockies. Forecast high temperatures today only in the 40s and 50s. 
It remains warm along the gulf coast, especially back down in through 
parts of Georgia and Florida where forecast high temperatures are 
into the 80s. Forecast weather maps -- later today on into Tuesday, 
more wet weather in texas, could be additional flooding. There are 
some flash flood watches in effect again. Look for high pressure to 
be building in through the northern Rockies and spreading eastward, 
bringing some drier air into the east along with those cooler temperatures. 
We take a look now at the extended forecast. On Wednesday, we'll find 
an icy mix up along the U.S.-Canadian border with forecast highs only 
in the 30s over northern Minnesota. 80s continue in parts of the gulf 
coast region and in the southwest. As we head into Thursday, rain 
in the northeast. We'll find cool temperatures, only in the 30s and 
40s, over the northern Great Lakes. And that cool weather will be 
spreading off towards the east as we head on into Friday with forecast 
highs only in the 40s in many locations. For more weather information,
