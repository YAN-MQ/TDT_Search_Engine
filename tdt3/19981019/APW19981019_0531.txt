The National Hockey League's participation in the 2002 Winter Olympics 
will depend on how negotiations go with broadcast rights holder NBC, 
says league commissioner Gary Bettman. ``The schedule has got to be 
put together so there is considerable prime-time (TV) exposure for 
the U.S. and Canadian teams because if we're not going to get substantial 
exposure for our players ... it doesn't make sense for us to go,'' 
Bettman said Monday. In Nagano, Japan, CBS relegated hockey to the 
late-night show, airing at either 11:35 p.m. or 12:35 a.m. Bettman 
made the comments while attending the book launch of the NHL-produced 
``Total Hockey: The Official Encyclopedia of the NHL.'' It was held 
at the Hockey Hall of Fame.
