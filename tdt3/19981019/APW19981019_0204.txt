Yugoslavia should join a mutual defense pact among former Soviet republics 
to deter possible NATO airstrikes, Russian lawmakers suggested Monday. 
A Russian parliamentary delegation that has just returned from southern 
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province also said Russia should provide military 
assistance to the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
``Since we have such close, friendly political relations with Yugoslavia, 
it would be strange not to increase economic cooperation, including 
military and technological cooperation ... so that in the face of 
NATO threats Yugoslavia has something to defend itself with,'' said 
Nikolai Bezborodov, deputy head of parliament's defense committee. 
Russia shares Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion with 
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, and strongly opposes 
NATO's proposed airstrikes. Western governments have warned that NATO 
might take military action against Yugoslavia following its crackdown 
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Twelve former Soviet republics 
_ all except the Baltics _ signed a deal on mutual defense aid when 
they formed a loose coalition after the 1991 Soviet collapse. Seeking 
to expand Russia's international influence, some Russian politicians 
have been suggesting that other countries also join. Lawmakers also 
said Yugoslavia should join a closer union between Russia and Belarus. 
The idea was proposed by the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, 
Vojislav Seselj, lawmakers told a joint news conference. ``It would 
be the most adequate response'' to NATO's potential strikes against 
Serbia, said Sergei Baburin, hard-line deputy speaker of the lower 
house of Russia's parliament, who led lawmakers' delegation to Kosovo. 
``We have received full proof that NATO wants to be the policeman 
of Europe,'' Baburin added. The Russian delegation will recommend 
that parliament attempt to send military aid to Yugoslavia, lawmakers 
said. However, Russia's foreign and defense policy is controlled by 
President Boris Yeltsin, and parliament has little say in the matter. 
The proposals for military aid came as delegation members expressed 
doubts that an agreement reached last week would hold. Even as they 
praised Russia's role in bringing about the agreement, lawmakers warned 
that without further progress, NATO may go ahead with airstrikes. 
``If this pause is not filled with real negotiations, the possibility 
of the resumption on the crisis would be very high,'' said pro-government 
lawmaker Vladimir Lukin. Echoing their leaders in Moscow, a group 
of leftist party bosses in the Ural Mountains have presented a letter 
to the U.S. and British consuls in the region, protesting ``aggressive 
actions by the United States and NATO,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported. ``We demand an end to political and diplomatic violence, 
as well as blackmail, in talks with the Yugoslav leaders,'' read the 
statement by the Ural branches of the Russian Communist Workers Party, 
the Union of Soviet Officers, and the Working Urals movement, according 
to ITAR-Tass. Also Monday, the new Yugoslav ambassador to Moscow arrived 
in the Russian capital. Borislav Milosevic is the brother of the Yugoslav 
president.
