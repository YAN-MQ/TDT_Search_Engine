Some anti-abortion protesters in New Jersey have lost a Supreme Court 
challenge over picketing outside a doctor's home. The high court denied 
a review of the case today. A lower court had placed distance and 
time restrictions on picketing outside the house of a doctor who performs 
abortions. Anti-abortion protesters had objected, arguing it violated 
their free speech rights.
