A few weeks back, we reported that U2's first Greatest Hits album 
will be in stores on November 3rd. Now comes word that a video from 
the band's recent pop mart tour will arrive on the same day. And if 
that's not enough to keep Bono and his band busy, details are now 
emerging about his foray into the world of films. A new movie called 
the Million Dollar Hotel is now in pre-production. It's based on an 
idea from Bono and writer Nicholas Klein. The story is said to be 
set in the year 2030 and revolves around two misfits in a seedy hotel. 
Their lives are turned upside down by a detective trying to solve 
a murder. Bono may have a role in the film that will likely star Mel 
Gibson as the detective.
