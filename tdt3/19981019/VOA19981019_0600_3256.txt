Equally busy as Bono seems to be actress/author and singer/songwriter 
Jewel. Earlier this year, Jewel's first book, a collection of poetry 
called "A Night Without Armor" hit bookstores. Well, it was such a 
success that she's been asked to put together a second book. According 
to Billboard Magazine, this one will be a scrapbook of photos, diary 
entries and mementos, possibly even a short story or two. We can expect 
to hear a few new tunes from Jewel, too. Her second CD, Spirit. is 
due out on November 17th.
