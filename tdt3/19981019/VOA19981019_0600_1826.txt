A Mideast peace summit outside Washington is moving into a fifth day 
today as all sides have agreed to extend those talks. President Clinton 
returned to Washington from the secluded Wye River Plantation after 
a surprise midnight meeting with hardline Israeli Foreign Minister 
Ariel Sharon. Mr. Sharon requested the meeting after the president 
had a brief conversation Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, 
but it is not known what was discussed. The president is expected 
to return to the talks for a third straight day, later today. The 
negotiations have been stalled over key elements of a key, a key deal 
that is, on Israeli's next West Bank withdrawal in return for security 
guarantees from the Palestinians. A U.S. spokesman declined to characterize 
the state of the negotiations but said if there is no agreement, there 
will be serious dangers ahead for the people of the region.
