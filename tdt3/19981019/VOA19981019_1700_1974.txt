A Spanish judge has expanded his case against former Chilean dictator 
Augusto Pinochet as Spain presses Britain to extradite the South American 
general. Magistrar Baltisar Garzone has added 94 charges of genocide, 
torture and terrorism, allegedly committed by the general against 
citizens of Argentina, Britain, Chile, Spain and the United States. 
General Pinochet has issued a statement from the London hospital where 
he is held under armed guard. He says any attempt to extradite him 
will be resolutely opposed. Meanwhile, Chile has sent a special envoy 
to London to argue for Mr. Pinochet's release. We get more from VOA 
correspondent Laurie Kassman. The death toll from Sunday's explosion. 
The final decision on whether to extradite Mr. Pinochet to Spain is 
up to the British Home Secretary, Jack Straw. Spain has 40 days to 
formally apply for extradition. Spanish radio says the two judges 
who requested Mr. Pinochet's arrest will probably travel to London 
in the next few days. The former Chilean leader was detained by police 
last Friday night as he was recuperating from back surgery at a London 
clinic. Chilean refugees and human rights groups have welcomed the 
detention. Chile has denounced it, reminding Britain that the former 
general is traveling on a diplomatic passport. So far, Britain's Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister are not commenting. Laurie Kassman, 
VOA News, London.
