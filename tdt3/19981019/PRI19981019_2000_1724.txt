You're listening to the World and you can join us anytime online at 
www.theworld.org. This is PRI. That's Public Radio International. 
This is Public Radio, 91 FM. I encourage you to go to your telephone 
now in this very short pledge break and make a membership pledge of 
support to 91 FM, public radio. Your membership dollars make the difference 
to 91 FM. We exist because listeners like you make pledges and provide 
the money that it takes to put the program on the air. The number 
to c all to make a pledge is 215 923-1234. That's 923-1234. I'm Lisa 
Mullins. Still ahead on the World... We would expect the Palestinian 
authority to reveal the entire infrastructure which has enabled this 
terrorist attack. A grenade blast in Israel rattles the middle east 
peace summit in Maryland. Mixed marriages and messages for blacks 
and whites in Brazil and Poland's singing cover girl. First up, this 
news. And now it's time to go over to west way,, where evening surgery 
has just ended and receptionist Louise discovered something ghastly 
in the health center fridge. While the U.S. president tries to convince 
both sides that an effective security plan can be worked out. With 
failure now a real possibility, news of King Hussain of Jordan's arrival 
in the Washington area reached the summit venue. Steven Sacket,, BBC 
News, Wye Mills, Maryland.
