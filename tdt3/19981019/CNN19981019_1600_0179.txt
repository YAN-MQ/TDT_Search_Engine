None. That's the one-word answer President Clinton gave to the question 
"how many times have you had sex with a federal or state employee 
since 1986?" The response was contained in documents made public today 
in Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against the president. Hundreds 
of pages were released, but they did not include a written transcript 
of the president's videotaped deposition. Jones' attorneys will argue 
tomorrow before the 8th circuit court of appeals to reinstate the 
suit, which was dismissed April 1st by federal district judge Susan 
Webber Wright. Meanwhile, settlement negotiations continue with the 
Jones team seeking $2 million to drop the suit.
