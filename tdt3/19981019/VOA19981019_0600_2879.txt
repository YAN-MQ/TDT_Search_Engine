To help citrus fruit packers control two fungal diseases that ruin 
stored fruit, scientists with the U.S. Agriculture Department have 
developed a new fungicidal treatment that's really 200 years old. 
The new/old fungicide is a natural mineral bath made of lime and sulfur 
that controls green mold and sour rot, two fungal diseases that have 
recently become resistant to synthetic chemical fungicides. Joe Smallenek, 
a USDA researcher in Fresno, California, says the recipe for the fungicide 
has its roots in British royalty. It's very old fungicide. It dates 
to early in the 19th century. It was a invention of the King's gardener 
in London. It's a combination of elemental sulfur and lime which is 
heated together and forms a yellowish liquid. The USDA researcher 
says use of the mineral fungicide has continued into the 20th century, 
principally among a small group of organic citrus producers. But while 
the lime sulfur bath is not toxic and kills fungi safely, it does 
have a downside for citrus handlers. The freshly sprayed fruit stinks 
of sulfur. That's Agriculture Briefs. I'm Rob Sivack.
