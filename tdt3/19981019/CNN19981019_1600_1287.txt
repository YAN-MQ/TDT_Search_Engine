Tyson gets his say. I'm Anthony Keith James, and this is "Headline 
Sports." Mike Tyson can box again in Nevada. The Nevada athletic commission, 
by a vote of 4-1, granted him a new license. It's been 15 months since 
he lost it, after biting Evander Holyfield's ear during a title fight. 
The commission did warn him, this will be his last chance. This will 
indeed be your last chance. Mike, you must take responsibility for 
yourself and act like the champion you once were. You will either 
conduct yourself in accordance with our rules and regulations, or 
you will probably never fight again in Nevada. An arbitrator today 
ruled that NBA owners do not have to pay players with guaranteed contracts 
during the lockout. You can bet that ruling strengthens the owners' 
bargaining position in the current labor talks.
