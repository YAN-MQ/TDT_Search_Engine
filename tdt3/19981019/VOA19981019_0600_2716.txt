U.S. government approves a multi-billion dollar package of Federal 
aid for farmers. Grain producers looking to store their bumper harvest 
find help on the Internet and citrus producers fighting mold in stored 
fruit find a new fungicide that's 200 years old. Rob Sivack has details 
in this edition of Agriculture Briefs. American farmers suffering 
from weather disasters, crop disease, slumping exports and low prices 
will soon be getting some financial relief. After months of partisan 
wrangling, the Clinton Administration and the U. S. Congress finally 
reached agreement on a massive Federal spending bill that includes 
nearly $6 billion in emergency farm aid. Agriculture groups have generally 
welcomed the farm aid package but some have questioned whether the 
Federal cash by itself can solve farmers' problems. Senator Kent Conrad, 
a Democrat from North Dakota whose state has been among the hardest 
hit by the farm crisis, told his Senate colleagues -- The hole in 
income and farm country is so deep that even $6 billion won't fill 
it but it'll certainly help. The bill also offers a variety of farm 
related tax breaks, crop insurance assistance and provokes about $3 
billion in direct cash payments to help debt strapped producers. Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman said the farm aid bill contains a level of 
assistance sufficient to help American farmers through what he called 
"the worst agricultural crisis in a decade."
