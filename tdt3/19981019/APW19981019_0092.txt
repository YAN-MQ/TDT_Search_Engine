Just days after a major typhoon killed dozens of people, tropical 
storm Babs crept towards the central Philippines on Monday, picking 
up strength after momentarily loosing steam, weathermen said. At noon 
(0400 GMT), Babs, with maximum sustained winds of 75 kph (46 mph) 
and gusts of up to 120 kph (75 mph), was over the Pacific Ocean about 
450 kilometers (280 miles) east southeast of Borongan town in Eastern 
Samar province, said forecaster Rene Molina. Molina said the storm 
would begin to be felt in Samar by late Monday or early Tuesday after 
having stalled at sea for several days. Molina said Babs, the ninth 
storm to hit the country this year, was likely to pick up speed and 
strength as it neared Samar. It was moving at a speed of 11 kph (7 
mph). As Babs approached, disaster officials continued to look for 
about 65 people still missing after Typhoon Zeb slammed the northern 
Philippines last week. Zeb killed at least 74 people and forced more 
than 415,000 others to flee their homes at the height of its onslaught. 
Most of those who fled have returned to repair their damaged homes. 
The typhoon destroyed an estimated 1.5 billion pesos (dlrs 35 million) 
worth of property and crops in 1,087 northern villages in the country's 
tobacco- and rice-growing region, officials said. After hitting the 
Philippines, Zeb moved on to skirt Taiwan, where 18 died, before cutting 
a swath across Japan. At least 12 people were killed in Japan.
