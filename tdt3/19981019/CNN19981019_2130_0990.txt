One sector of the stock market that's taking a beating is mortgage 
real estate investment trusts. Charles Molineaux examines the problems 
and what lies ahead. Under a relentless barrage of frightening news, 
stock investors' confidence in real estate investment trusts just 
keeps dropping. Since the bankruptcy of mortgage reit crimmey Mae 
two years ago, price waterhouse Coopers security's index of mortgage 
reit stocks has plummeted 19.5%. they are now down 62% for the year. 
If you have the Cadillac of mortgage reits in crimmey Mae essentially 
going under, that's affected sort of the rest of the party. There's 
been a flight to treasury securities by investors who are removing 
their money from equity and also removing their money from risky securities, 
such as mortgaged-backed securities, into less-risky investments such 
as treasuries. Industry watchers say the trouble began mid year as 
investors became concerned the real estate market had topped off. 
As interest rates dropped, a wave of prepayments had refinancing squeezed 
rates interest payment income. And as the market fell and hedge funds 
reported big losses, widespread fear of risk in the debt markets made 
investors more nervous still. Ironic, because commercial mortgage 
reits are seeing historically low delinquency rates as they collect 
payments. Strategists suspect that mortgage reits may indeed have 
reached their bottom. Certainly mortgage-lending activity is strong 
across the board. We aren't in a recession. Prepayments will stop 
or slow down when mortgage rates bottom out. And I think the liquidity 
crisis will ease up. The companies have taken a lot of steps to reduce 
their borrowings, be basically less at risk to a fertile liquidity 
securities. More hard months may be ahead as investors wait to see 
if worldwide capital markets stabilize. Mortgage reits could also 
see a round of year-end selling by investors looking to take a tax 
loss. So fundamentals notwithstanding, analysts don't expect a big 
turnaround before the beginning of next year. Charles Molineaux, "CNN
