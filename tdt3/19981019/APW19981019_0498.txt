For San Diegans who like to gamble, smoke in bars or buy beer at 18, 
the perfect place to watch the World Series is just 20 miles (32 kilometers) 
away. For Tijuana residents, who hold baseball second only to soccer 
as their favorite pastime, the Padres' climb to the Series is just 
as much their accomplishment as it is San Diego's. In these sister 
cities where cultures blend and crossing the border means opportunity 
to both sides, Padres Fever creates another unshakable bond. ``It's 
the team of the region, of Tijuana and all of Baja California,'' said 
Raul Robles, 35, who has a ticket to Game 4 Wednesday at Qualcomm 
Stadium. The Tijuana man watched Game 2 of the ``Serie Mundial'' Sunday 
at the crowded Las Pulgas bar on the city's main nightclub strip, 
as did Ernesto Hernandez, 28, who went to 30 Padres home games this 
season. ``All of the people (here) are supporting San Diego,'' said 
Hernandez, refusing to give up hope despite the Padres' two losses 
in New York. ``The Padres are going to win here in San Diego.'' The 
fan base is so deep in Mexico that Padres majority owner John Moores 
and president Larry Lucchino arranged for games to be broadcast across 
the border and opened the first major league merchandise store in 
Mexico, the Padres Store in Tijuana. San Diegan Robert Hildebracht, 
38, is happy about the broadcasting arrangement because he'd rather 
watch the game in Tijuana. He gets his next chance Tuesday in Game 
3. ``I like to drink beer, I like to watch baseball and I like to 
smoke, and you can do all that here,'' Hildebracht said. Smoking in 
bars is banned in California. Some Americans among the crowd of mostly 
locals at Las Pulgas were there to take advantage of Mexico's legal 
drinking age, 18. ``We're underage and we want to drink,'' said Alex 
Mendoza, 19, who is two birthdays shy of legally drinking in California. 
He crossed the border with a friend and a cousin to enjoy the game. 
But most American sports fans travel to Tijuana to gamble. There are 
about 10 betting shops where wagers are taken on everything from the 
NBA to the Kentucky Derby to college football. ``I don't have to go 
to Vegas,'' said Jeffrey Amey, 39, a San Diegan and a regular visitor 
to Caliente Race and Sports Book near the border. ``The odds are better 
there, but I don't have to buy a plane ticket.'' Americans can park 
their cars on the U.S. side of the border or take the San Diego Trolley 
to the international line, then make a short walk to betting parlors 
along the town's main streets. Just past the taxi station, the taco 
stands and tables of souvenir trinkets is an open-air parlor, where 
bettors sit on white plastic chairs and root for teams playing in 
games that are shown on several awning-covered televisions.
