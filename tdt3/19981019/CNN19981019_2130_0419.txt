The U.N. refugee agency has canceled two relief convoys to Kosovo 
and has sent a team to investigate reports of Serb tanks rumbling 
toward a camp of displaced ethnic Albanians. A surge of violence has 
struck the southern Yugoslav province despite a NAto threat to launch 
air strikes if Serb police are not withdrawn. 0% of Kosovo's 2 million 
inhabitants are ethnic Albanian, and most want independence from Serbia 
-- Yugoslavia's dominant republic. Hundreds of people have been killed 
since February, when President Slobodan milosevic's crackdown began 
on the separatists. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes to 
escape the violence.
