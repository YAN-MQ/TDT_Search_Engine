In a courtroom in Washington today opening statements in one of the 
biggest anti-trust court cases ever. It involved Microsoft, part owner 
of the MSNBC cable network. At issue, whether or not the company founded 
by Bill Gates now amounts to a Monopoly and is using its dominant 
position in the computer software market to hurt potential competitors. 
Here is NBC news justice correspondent Pete Williams. Microsoft is 
so dominant that its windows computer program touches virtually all 
Americans. Either because they own it, use it at work, O do business 
with someone who does. It runs 90% of the personal computers sold 
today. But government lawyers claim that Microsoft holds a monopoly 
by illegally intimidating the competition with a simple goal. To harm 
competition and to harm consumers. To limit what products can come 
to market. And to prevent people with new and better ideas from getting 
a fair chance. Exhibit A, a meeting Microsoft officials had three 
years ago with Netscape. Government lawyers today accused Microsoft 
of illegally trying to stop netscape from selling its froom windows 
user. Microsoft's billionaire founder said he didn't know about the 
Netscape strategy. But lawyers showed exerts from Gates' own company 
E-mail. Microsoft says those comments are just snippets taken out 
of context. It warns the government trying to meddle. The software 
industry itself is intensely innovative and competitive. Every year 
there are thousands of new products brought to market. There are thousands 
of new companies that are being formed. The company insists it must 
be free to add new features to its products. And some economists say 
there's always a risk when the government steps in. The high-tech 
industry, computer industry, it's a wonderful wild and whooly free 
for all. It's Dodge city in the 1808's. This isn't a jury trial. So 
the issue for the judge, has Microsoft illegally locked up the business 
so that the next Bill Gates doesn't stand a chance? As for how big 
Microsoft is, consider this. Government lawyers prepared their legal 
briefs using the justice department's latest computer software, Windows 
95.
