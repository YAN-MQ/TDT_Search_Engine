Top seeded American Pete Sampras has picked up his first victory since 
Wimbledon by defeating Slovakian Carl Kuchara at the CA trophy indoor 
event in Vienna, Austria. Sampras needed just over two hours to beat 
the fifth seeded Kuchara, six/three, seven/six and six/one. It was 
only his fourth title of the year after winning eight in 1997. The 
27 year old Sampras fired 13 aces and broke Kuchara's serve four times 
on the way to the 56th title of his career, which is the most among 
active players.
