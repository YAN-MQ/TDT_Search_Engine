Microsoft is expected to give opening statements tomorrow in its antitrust 
lawsuit. Today was the government's turn. Prosecutors focused on a 
1995 meeting between Microsoft and its rival, netscape, at which Microsoft 
allegedly proposed dividing the Internet software market. The government 
showed jurors videotaped pretrial interviews with Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates in which they claim he is reluctant to discuss the meeting. 
Analysts say the justice department is playing hardball. I think we're 
moving on to the stage where the government is going to seek some 
kind of permanent relief against this company which could mean a Formal 
separation of the browser and the operating system markets, anything 
up to declaring windows an essential facility, which could be very 
intrusive to this company. Microsoft's chief lawyer says the evidence 
will show the company is a fair competitor and an innovator.
