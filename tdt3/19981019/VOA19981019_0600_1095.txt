The New York Yankees have dominated the San Diego Padres, nine to 
three, in game two of major league baseball's World Series. The Yankees 
pounded San Diego starting pitcher Andy Ashby for three runs in each 
of the first two innings Sunday in New York. Another Yankee scored 
in the third inning and two run home run by Jorge Posada in the fifth 
inning put the game out of reach. New York snuffed out a San Diego 
rally in the eighth inning that produced two runs for the Padres. 
New York's Derek Jeter says the Yankees are playing the same way they 
have during the regular season when New York won a record 114 games. 
We've been doing it all year, you know. If the team makes a mistake, 
we've been able to capitalize on it and that's what you have to do, 
especially when you're playing a team like the Padres. They make any 
mistakes, you've got to go on and take advantage of it because you're 
not going to have many opportunities to score. The victory gives the 
Yankees a two to nothing lead in the best of seven games championship. 
The World Series continues Tuesday in San Diego. The Padres will also 
host game four on Wednesday and if needed, game five on Thursday.
