Jorge Posada has been 60 feet 6 inches away from the incredibly unfolding 
story of Orlando Hernandez all season. Virtually every time Hernandez 
has hiked his left knee up around his ear in his funky motion, Posada 
has been behind the plate waiting to see what will transpire. Usually, 
Hernandez has produced positive developments. The tandem worked splendidly 
again on Sunday night as Posada belted a two-run homer and Hernandez 
followed the catcher's signals to guide the Yankees to a 9-3 triumph 
over the San Diego Padres in Game 2 of the World Series. Manager Joe 
Torre selected Hernandez to give David Cone two extra days of rest 
before Game 3, but the manager also did it because he trusts the Cuban 
pitcher. Posada has trusted the pitcher known as El Duque since he 
debuted with the team in June. From his amazing pitches to his amazing 
poise, Hernandez has made Posada and everyone else understand how 
dominant a pitcher he can be. But it took Hernandez a little longer 
to show trust in Posada or any other Yankee. ``I can relate to him 
and what he went through because my father went through it,'' said 
Posada, whose father, Jorge Sr., left Cuba for Puerto Rico. ``My Dad 
is Cuban. I know it's tough for him. In the beginning, he didn't know 
what to do. It was tough so I tried to help him. I tried to help him 
in every way possible.'' On Sunday night, Hernandez did not need much 
help. He stopped the Padres on one run and six hits, striking out 
seven in seven innings. He is 2-0 with a 0.64 earned run average in 
the post-season. When a reporter asked Posada if Hernandez had his 
best stuff, the catcher said, ``What do you think?'' It was obvious 
what Posada thought and it was obvious that Hernandez had a neat repertory, 
including a strong fastball. The Padres did not seem to be able to 
see his pitches sometimes and looked lost against El Duque. ``That's 
pretty much the same El Duque we have seen all season,'' said Joe 
Girardi, who caught Hernandez twice during the regular season. ``People 
call him a young pitcher, but he's not a young pitcher. When you pitch 
over there, you're pitching for your life.'' With the Yankees leading, 
7-1, in the fifth, Posada batted with one out and Scott Brosius on 
first. The fans at the Stadium were satisfied yet subdued because 
the Yankees seemingly had enough offense to complete the night. But 
Posada turned the hysteria up a little bit more by drilling a ball 
over the center field fence off Brian Boehringer to extend the lead 
to 9-1. It was his second homer of the post-season. While it was overlooked 
because Chuck Knoblauch blasted a three-run homer and Tino Martinez 
had a grand slam, Posada started the seven-run eruption in the seventh 
inning of Game 1 with a sharp one-out single to right field. The inning 
that Posada initiated helped ruin the Padres on Saturday and then 
he called the pitches that helped destroy them on Sunday. ``We've 
gotten some clutch hits when we needed them,'' said Posada. ``Hopefully, 
we can keep scoring and get as many runs as we need to get in the 
next two games.''
