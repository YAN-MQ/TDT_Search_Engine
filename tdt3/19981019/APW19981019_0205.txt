Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet vowed from his hospital 
bed Monday to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations 
of murder, genocide and torture, and said in a statement issued by 
his lawyers that he is confident of winning. Chile's ambassador delivered 
a formal protest to the Foreign Office, declaring Britain has violated 
Pinochet's diplomatic immunity by placing him under arrest at a Spanish 
magistrate's request. Spain, meanwhile, increased the charges to genocide 
_ for which there is no diplomatic immunity. In the statement issued 
through his lawyers _ his first public comment since police arrested 
him in his bed Friday night _ Pinochet said he would resolutely oppose 
extradition. ``Upon his arrival he was treated as a VIP,'' said the 
statement by the London law firm Kingsley Napley. ``Permission for 
him to enter and stay in this country was stamped in his diplomatic 
passport.'' The 82-year-old Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized 
for as long as two more weeks, now faces a long battle through British 
courts to avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judges who 
instigated the extradition proceedings, and a humiliating appearance 
before London's Bow Street magistrate's court. Pinochet's 17-year-rule 
was marked by torture and other human rights abuses against political 
opponents. A Chilean government report after he left office said 4,299 
political opponents were killed or vanished during his rule. He remained 
Chilean army commander-in-chief until March. Both Britain and Chile 
appear ready to dig in for a long dispute. After a 70-minute meeting 
at the Foreign Office ended in deadlock, Chilean Ambassador Mario 
Artaza told reporters that Chile is trying to protect its institutions. 
Pinochet is immune from prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life, 
and he arrived here on a diplomatic passport. ``The government of 
Chile is not trying to shield Mr. Pinochet from the wrath of the law,'' 
the ambassador said. ``This is really a matter of international law 
and processes.'' Britain says diplomatic immunity is reserved for 
accredited diplomats or foreign government officials on official visits, 
which doesn't cover Pinochet. Artaza said that Pinochet, who underwent 
spinal surgery Oct. 9, did not fully appreciate what was happening 
when he woke to find police in his room with the arrest warrant. ``He 
was under sedation and he had been interrupted from his sleep,'' Artaza 
said. ``He didn't understand what was going on and the doctors treating 
him were taken out from his room.'' In Spain on Monday, the lead magistrate 
in the case, Baltasar Garzon, widened the basis of his original detention 
request to include charges of genocide, torture and murder in the 
disappearance of 94 people, mostly Chileans. The original arrest warrant 
was for questioning about an unspecified number of Spaniards who were 
killed or vanished in the first decade after Pinochet seized power 
in 1973. Lawmakers of the opposition Conservative Party charged Prime 
Minister Tony Blair's 18-month-old Labor Party government with ``gesture 
politics.'' In Conservative government days, Pinochet was welcomed 
on regular visits that included having tea with former Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher and staying in a five-star hotel. He had also, unlike 
other Latin American leaders, supported Britain in its 1982 war against 
Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands. Tory legislator Alan Clark, 
a former defense minister, called the arrest ``monstrous.'' ``It shows 
that if something's politically correct, or they deem it to be, the 
government will simply fall over themselves to appease any particular 
lobby,'' Clark said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. 
The move appeared to be popular, however. Most callers to a Sky TV 
phone-in Monday supported Pinochet's arrest, and newspapers carried 
detailed accounts of killings and torture in Chile in the '70s and 
'80s. London's liberal Guardian newspaper commented that Pinochet's 
``discreet love affair with England'' had gone horribly wrong.
