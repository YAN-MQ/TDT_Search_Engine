Hundreds of people converged on this small Nigerian town over the 
weekend, drawn by rumors of spilled gasoline free for the taking _ 
and at least 500 were killed when the fuel erupted into a ball of 
fire, officials said Monday. With dozens of charred, unidentified 
bodies littering the town and flames still occasionally flaring up 
to 20 meters (65 feet) in the air, authorities began the grim task 
Monday of burying those incinerated by the ball of fire. Firefighters 
stopped fighting the flames and waited for the blaze, which spread 
thick black smoke for miles (kilometers) around, to burn itself out. 
Grieving relatives also came to Jesse, about 300 kilometers (180 miles) 
southeast of Lagos, searching for the charred remains of their loved 
ones. ``It is finished,'' cried Charity Unurhoro, after finding the 
horribly burned bodies of her mother and brother. ``Now everything 
is over for me.'' As she cried, a man told a young relative to fetch 
a wheelbarrow to take the corpses home for burial. The fire, which 
began Saturday as the residents tried to scoop gasoline spilling from 
a pipeline, killed at least 500 people and left at least 100 hospitalized, 
military officials said. The area's hospitals _ most of which only 
have a handful of doctors and nurses and little in the way of burn 
care _ were overwhelmed by the disaster, with doctors overworked and 
medicine in short supply, local officials said. Pickup 8th graf previous,
