Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned with Rep. Charles Schumer for the 
second time in a month on Monday, assailing Sen.Alfonse D'Amato for 
deluging Schumer with a ``blizzard of negative advertising,'' and 
she explicitly urged women to support the Democratic challenger in 
November. ``If you look at the records of these two men _ and they've 
both been in public life, so we don't have to guess _ there is absolutely 
no choice,'' Mrs. Clinton declared at a fund-raiser for the Brooklyn 
congressman in Manhattan on Monday morning. ``Al D'Amato does not 
deserve the votes of the women in New York _ he has consistently voted 
against so many issues that women care about, that we think about.'' 
The first lady's unusually blunt appeal to women voters _ she assailed 
D'Amato for everything from opposing abortion rights to opposing new 
penalties for spousal abuse _ was one sign of the importance the two 
candidates attach to women in these last two weeks of the campaign. 
Another sign could be found two hours later at a medical center in 
New Rochelle, N.Y., where the Republican senator trumpeted his work 
on behalf of breast cancer patients, and vowed that he would fight 
for $1 billion for breast cancer research next term. D'Amato, as has 
become the daily custom of his fourth statewide campaign, also turned 
the issue of breast cancer research into an opportunity to scold Schumer 
for missing votes in Congress. He said Schumer had been absent in 
the House of Representatives for a vote on a $250 billion Defense 
Department appropriations bill that included $135 million for breast 
cancer research. The bill was approved, 369 to 43, last month. The 
first lady made two campaign appearances with Schumer, helping raise 
about $250,000 at the midtown fund-raiser, and then joining him at 
Nassau Community College here. Monday was the second time she has 
campaigned in the state alone on behalf of the congressman, underscored 
the importance the White House has put on winning a seat that Democrats 
consider vulnerable, and, in the process, defeating the senator who 
led a congressional investigations into the Clintons' Whitewater business 
dealings. The president has also appeared with Schumer during this 
campaign and will return once more before the end of the month, Schumer's 
aides said. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton used their two appearances to 
discuss the tactics of the campaign and to draw contrasts between 
the congressman and D'Amato on issues of concern to women and on education. 
To prolonged cheers at the college, Mrs. Clinton assailed D'Amato 
for voting to cut various scholarship programs, like Pell grants, 
while Schumer repeated what has become the cornerstone proposal of 
his campaign: making college tuition tax deductible for families with 
incomes up to $150,000. ``It's one of the mainstays of this campaign 
to make the cost of all college tuition completely deductible,'' Schumer 
said. ``I will fight until my last breath to make college affordable 
for you and your younger brothers and sisters and our future generations.'' 
Mrs. Clinton echoed Schumer's remarks. ``Al D'Amato has consistently 
_ not just once, but consistently _ supported cuts to student loans,'' 
the first lady said. ``I don't understand that. Why would anyone want 
to pull up the ladder of opportunity after you've already climbed 
it?'' The main subject of interest on Monday was how women would vote 
in November. Speaking before about 150 people at a luncheon at Sound 
Shore Medical Center in New Rochelle, D'Amato said he had secured 
$900 million for breast cancer research since 1992, much of which 
was channeled to institutions in New York. ``I fought to see to it 
that $135 million this year went into the battle against breast cancer, 
so that we can win it, and we are making tremendous strides,'' D'Amato 
said.
