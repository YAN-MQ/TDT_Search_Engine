Debt-saddled Long Term Credit Bank of Japan will seek temporary nationalization 
this week after being informed by regulators that its liabilities 
exceed its assets, a news report said Tuesday. LTCB will apply to 
be taken under state control Friday when a new law aimed at bailing 
out Japan's troubled banking sector takes effect, public broadcaster 
NHK reported. Earlier this month Japan's Parliament passed laws allowing 
the government to take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them 
down and to pump up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in public 
funds into the cash-strapped financial system. The government's Financial 
Supervisory Agency informed LTCB on Monday that the bank had a capital 
deficit at the end of the current fiscal first half on Sept. 30, if 
all its assets were measured at market value, Kyodo News agency reported. 
An agency official confirmed it has informed LTCB about the results 
of its inspection, but added that it can't comment on an individual 
bank's asset and liability situation. The agency also said, however, 
that valued at acquisition prices, LTCB's assets exceeded its liabilities, 
Kyodo reported, adding that Japan's accounting regulations allow banks 
to value assets at purchase costs for book-keeping purposes. But regulators 
regard market valuation as a better guide than purchase costs to a 
bank's overall health since the former includes losses in a bank's 
stock and securities holdings in calculating balance sheets, Kyodo 
said. LTCB, once a major pillar of Japan's postwar financial system, 
has seen its share price tumble as low as 3 yen (U.S. dlrs 0.26) in 
recent trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The bank rescue package 
passed by Parliament is seen as crucial for cleaning up the heap of 
bad loans left by the collapse in the early 1990s of Japan's runaway 
real estate and stock prices. It is also a key first step in the country's 
efforts to overcome its deepest recession since the end of World War 
II.
