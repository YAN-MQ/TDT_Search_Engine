America's college campuses tonight, the semester has already turned 
deadly. From alcohol abuse. Three dead in ten days. From the White 
House to the dean's office, there are new efforts to try to turn off 
the tap. Here's NBC's Jim Avila. This is what's new, and some say 
is out of control -- binge drinking at American colleges. It's nearly 
a competitive event in itself. Two out of five students on the nation's 
campuses say they've done it in the last two weeks. Health and human 
services secretary Donna Shalala today. It's worse because of binge 
drinking, which is not something that we necessarily faced 20 or 30 
years ago. And it's dangerous. Every year 200 to 300 students die 
from alcohol poisoning. But more importantly, drinking on campus leads 
to trouble. According to a Columbia University study, 95% of all violent 
crime is related to alcohol. 0% of all campus rapes occur when either 
victim or assailant is drunk. More than half of all injuries of any 
kind are alcohol related. He went under and didn't come back. Over 
the last 10 days, a drunk University of Tampa student drowns in the 
Hillsboro river. Stanford bans the phi Delta theta fraternity after 
a student falls from a Second-floor balcony. And a University of Michigan 
sorority student dies after a fall from her sixth-floor window after 
drinking at a party. This is about as rough as it gets. What's different 
about drinking on the campus of the '90s? The experts say it's not 
social drinking. It's drinking with a specific goal in mind, getting 
drunk. The percentages of students who now drink specifically to get 
drunk has increased dramatically over the last four years. Dr. Patrick 
Johnson at Columbia University's center for addition and substance 
abuse. Their study shows that more students will ultimately die of 
alcohol related deaths than will earn a masters or doctorate degree 
combined. They have the conception of the "animal house" notion. Secretary 
Shalala at the University of New Hampshire, 91 students were arrested 
during the first month of school for drinking on campus. They're taken 
to jail in protective custody until they can sober up. Drinking has 
always been a part of campus life, a right of passage. What puzzles 
the experts in the '90s is why students are now drinking to such excess.
