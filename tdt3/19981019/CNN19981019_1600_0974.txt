Stocks kick off the week with stellar gains. Let's get the latest 
market numbers from Jan Hopkins in the cnnfn news desk in New York. 
jan? an? Thanks, Chuck. Stocks didn't hold on to their highs, but 
they still managed to rack up some healthy gains. Not a bad day considering 
its the 11th anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash. The Dow Jones 
industrials gaining 49 points at 8466. It's the first time the Dow 
has closed above 8500 since late August. Shares of jp Morgan contributing 
to that rally, closing up 3 3/8 dollars a Share. That's despite reporting 
much weaker-than-expected results.
