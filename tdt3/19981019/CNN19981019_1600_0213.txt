The woman who says she urged Linda Tripp to start taping some of her 
phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky is being subpoenaed. New 
York literary agent lucianne Goldberg and her son are being called 
before a Maryland grand jury. Prosecutors are looking into whether 
Tripp broke state law by making the tapes. It's illegal in Maryland 
to record a person's phone conversation without their consent.
