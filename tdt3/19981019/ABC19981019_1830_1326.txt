Several mergers or takeovers of note today. Monday is typically merger 
day because deals are finalized over the weekend when the markets 
are closed. That great American symbol of highway travel, Greyhound, 
is going Canadian. The Canadian transportation company laidlaw now 
says "leave the driving to us" all over north America. The largest 
grocery chain in the country is being formed. Kroger, in the south, 
and the Fred Meyer chain in the west, will become one -- 300,000 employees 
altogether.
