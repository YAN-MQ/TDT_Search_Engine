With dozens of charred bodies littering the town, authorities began 
burying at least 500 people on Monday, victims of a devastating pipeline 
explosion over the weekend. Some who were too burned to be identified 
would be placed in mass graves, officials said. Although flames from 
the ruptured pipeline occasionally flared up to 20 meters (65 feet) 
in the air, by late Monday firefighters stopped fighting the blaze 
and waited for it to burn itself out. Meanwhile relatives converged 
on the disaster scene in Jesse, 300 kilometers (180 miles) southeast 
of Lagos, to search for remains of their loved ones. ``It is finished,'' 
cried Charity Unurhoro, after finding the horribly burned bodies of 
her mother and brother. ``Now everything is over for me.'' As she 
cried, a man told a young relative to fetch a wheelbarrow to take 
the corpses home for burial. The fire, which began Saturday as residents 
scooped gasoline spilling from a pipeline, killed at least 500 people 
and left at least 100 hospitalized, military officials said. Some 
corpses _ including those of some children _ were found clutching 
plastic cups, funnels and cans to collect the fuel. The charred body 
of one woman was found with her dead baby strapped to her back. Many 
other victims were farmers and villagers sleeping in their homes. 
Military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar flew in by helicopter for 
a 15-minute visit. He said the government would pay for medical treatment, 
but that there would be no compensation to survivors, apparently because 
many of those killed were stealing fuel. But residents were furious 
over the deaths, saying the dead were mostly poor people trying to 
make ends meet. ``This is a tragedy of huge proportions,'' the Rev. 
Andrew Imadu, a local minister, said at one funeral in Jesse. ``Our 
own people have been driven by deprivation to such a desperate search 
for livelihood.'' Southeastern Nigeria, while rich in oil, is scarred 
by decades of poverty and villagers in some areas are believed to 
regularly sabotage oil pipelines in order to file claims for compensation. 
Despite Nigeria's enormous oil wealth, years of government misrule 
and corruption have resulted in almost constant fuel shortages, causing 
skyrocketing black-market prices and long lines at gas pumps. The 
surface pipeline links a refinery in the southeastern city of Warri, 
350 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Lagos, with the northern city 
of Kaduna, nearly 600 kilometers (380 miles) away. Over the weekend, 
hundreds of people had arrived in Jesse after hearing rumors that 
a huge pool of gasoline _ which had spilled from the pipeline into 
a concrete well _ was available for the taking, according to J.I. 
Ogude, village chief of Jesse. The gasoline theft, known as ``bunkering,'' 
had started as early as Saturday morning, he said. People at the scene, 
who Ogude said came from at least seven villages, were preparing to 
sell the gasoline on the black market. An official for Nigeria's state 
petroleum corporation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities 
believed the pipeline had been deliberately punctured, and that the 
scavengers' tools had sparked the explosion. But some newspaper reports 
said a carelessly discarded cigarette may have been the cause of what 
witnesses said started as a loud roar followed by high flames spreading 
over the oily slick. Ogude said government petroleum officials knew 
of the scavengers and had tried to frighten them with a hovering helicopter 
on Saturday. When that failed, police had been sent to disperse the 
crowd, but they arrived too late, seeing the explosion as they neared 
the village, he said.
