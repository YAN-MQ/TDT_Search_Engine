About 50 French and foreign protesters burst into the International 
Chamber of Commerce on Monday, on the eve of new talks aimed at liberalizing 
international investment. The protesters passed out communiques detailing 
their complaints against the proposed Multilateral Investment Agreement 
treaty and slapped ``Stop MAI'' stickers onto the walls of the building. 
The proposed agreement aims to liberalize the flow of direct international 
investments, but its critics say liberalization would undermine a 
nation's control over its own economy. Talks broke down this spring 
largely due to French insistence on protecting its cultural and audiovisual 
industries. Negotiators decided to take a six-month break to consult 
their governments and come back with proposals to try to break the 
impasse. Negotiations were set to resume Tuesday at the Paris-based 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, the 
world club of industrialized countries which is hosting the talks. 
France, however, said last week that it will shun the meeting. The 
demonstrators, who came from more than 20 countries, crowded into 
an upstairs meeting room inside the Chamber to lay out their complaints 
about the agreement. Lori Wallach, director of global trade watch 
for Public Citizen in Washington D.C., said the MAI, if passed, would 
mean ``rule by corporations. It would disempower the role of government 
in regulating our day-to-day lives.'' Members of the International 
Chamber of Commerce refused to take part in the discussion, saying 
the protesters had entered the building without permission and scribbled 
graffiti on the walls, said Vincent J. O'Brien, the group's deputy 
director of communications. An international business lobby, however, 
said it was ``very disappointed that France has decided to pull out 
of the negotiations.'' The Business and Industry Advisory Committee 
to the OECD said in a statement that many non-OECD nations were interested 
in the accord and that member governments ``should avoid sending a 
poor signal to these countries. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin 
instead has urged new negotiations instead at the Geneva-based World 
Trade Organization, as Canada has also suggested. A WTO agreement 
would likely take longer to reach and would likely be weaker, due 
to protectionist policies of many member-developing countries.
