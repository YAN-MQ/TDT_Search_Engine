When we come back, "the fleecing of America" at the gas pump. Are 
you getting short-changed when you fill up the tank? Tylenol house 
call... from extra strength Tylenol. Your medicine cabinet. You use 
it every day. But do you really know what's in there? Not everything. 
no. I never thought about it. My medicine cabinet? Well, it pays to 
take a good look in your medicine cabinet. You might be surprised 
to find... that you may have a prescription drug... that could interact 
with an over-the-counter medication, altering the effectiveness or 
safety... of one or both of the drugs. So here are some tips... for 
you and your medicine cabinet. First, read the label for any warnings 
about drug interactions. Then get rid of all out-of-date medicines... 
and those you don't take anymore. Who needs 'em? And if you're one 
of the millions of people... who takes a prescription drug, remember, 
the pain reliever associated with the least risk... of drug interaction 
and side effects... is the medicine in Tylenol. So check out your 
medicine cabinet. Any questions? Check with your doctor or pharmacist.
