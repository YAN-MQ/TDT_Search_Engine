The NFL "performance of the week "comes from San Francisco's Steve 
young. The '9ers qb set an NFL record Sunday by passing for over 300 
yards in his sixth straight game. Young also ran for two touchdowns 
to give him 40 career rushing TDs. That ties the record for quarterbacks. 
The '9ers beat the Colts 34-31, thanks to Steve young's "performance 
of the week."
