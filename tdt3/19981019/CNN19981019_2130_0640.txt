Most personal computers sold these days come with Microsoft operating 
systems. Ann Kellan reports in this "tech trends," it's hard to find 
a computer with anything other than Windows 95 or 98. Welcome to gateway 
country. How can we help you? Let's walk over this way. Buy a computer 
from one of the top three personal computer manufacturers and you're 
going to pay for a Microsoft operating system whether you want it 
or not. The options we can do here is Windows 95 and Windows 98. Computermaker 
gateway demonstrated how its customers can pick and choose what they 
want in a computer. But the operating system has to be Microsoft. 
Dell, another computer manufacturer, told CNN -- and when we called 
Micron asking for a computer without an operating system so we could 
load our own -- So can I just get an empty box? No, we have to sell 
it to you with an operating system. And if I don't want to use Microsoft 
-- then I'm paying for an operating system that I'm ultimately not 
going to use. Correct. According to Microsoft, it's up to each computermaker 
to decide the system it supports. Those mainline manufacturers can 
sell personal computers with any operating system they want. They 
can, but they don't. They say it's not cost effective to offer and 
support other operating systems like OS-2 or a relative up-and-comer 
called linux, since so few people use them. Most of our customers 
are wanting Windows 98. So we don't deal with it on a regular basis. 
And though the major manufacturers only offer Microsoft, we did find 
smaller, Lesser-known computer companies offering a choice and making 
a profit. Ann Kellan, CNN, New York.
