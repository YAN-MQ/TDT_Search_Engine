An FBI hate crimes unit is investigating the October 2nd beating death 
of a Gay New York man. Gary trzaska was beaten so severely after he 
left a Buffalo bar that virtually every organ in his body was damaged. 
Police believe robbery was the motive for the attack. But his attackers 
left $200 in cash and an expensive watch. His family has asked the 
task force to investigate the matter. A 16-year-old is in custody 
charged with second-degree murder. Two others are being sought.
