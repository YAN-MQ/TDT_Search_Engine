India and Pakistan have finished three days of talks on the long disputed 
province of Kashmere. They did not reach any agreement. But India's 
chief negotiator said the meetings in Islamavod and they ended yesterday, 
were a beginning of more discussion rather than a sign of failure. 
Talks on less difficult matters are expected to resume within the 
next few months. The foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan are 
trying to find common ground on their long-standing dispute over Kashmere.
