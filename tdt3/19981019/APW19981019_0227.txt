Iraqi officials lashed out at U.N. arms monitors Monday, saying that 
they act unprofessionally and in one case turned on music and danced 
as they examined a missile production site. Iraq repeatedly has accused 
U.N. weapons inspectors of espionage and on Aug. 5 ordered an end 
to surprise inspections by the arms experts, effectively banning all 
searches for elements of its past weapons programs. Iraq has recently 
mounted a campaign to discredit the remaining inspectors, who are 
only allowed to visit weapons sites where the United Nations already 
has surveillance equipment installed. One Iraqi official, Kahlil Hameed, 
accused the monitors of turning on cassette recorders and dancing 
in August while examining a missile site. Hammed also said monitors 
used their personal cameras to take photographs of civilians, passing 
cars and visitors to the missile production site that he administers. 
Iraqi authorities arranged the interview with Hameed to back up accusations 
by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that the inspectors engaged in 
espionage. Aziz made that claim in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan released Saturday. U.N. weapons officials in Baghdad were 
not available for comment. Sudat Mohammed of the Iraqi National Monitoring 
Directorate, which coordinates activities for the remaining 40 inspectors 
in Iraq, said that some inspectors carried cameras and photographed 
army movements and activities in and around Iraqi weapons sites. ``Incidents 
like this unfortunately indicate that the inspectors use the authority 
and mandate given to them in a bad manner to collect information,'' 
Mohammed said. In a related development, the official Iraqi News Agency 
said Monday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his cabinet reviewed 
the inspections. The cabinet also reviewed contacts with Annan to 
resolve the current row over spot inspections, the agency reported. 
The United Nations imposed sweeping economic sanctions against Iraq 
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions will not be 
lifted until the inspectors verify that Baghdad has eliminated its 
weapons of mass destruction.
