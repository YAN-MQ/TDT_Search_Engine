Almost everyone in a somber San Diego Padres clubhouse seemed impressed 
with Orlando Hernandez on Sunday night. Almost everyone except Wally 
Joyner, that is. Joyner just seemed frustrated. ``I mean he's a great 
pitcher and all,'' Joyner said after the Padres had lost Game 2 of 
the World Series to the Yankees, 9-3. ``But I hit a line drive that 
Paul O'Neill caught to keep me from getting extra bases, and I hit 
a hard grounder that Chuck Knoblauch caught to keep me from getting 
a hit. Why should he impress me?'' But Hernandez impressed everybody 
else in his seven innings, as he gave up just one run on six hits 
and helped give the Yankees a 2-0 lead in the series. He left most 
of the Padres longing for home. Tony Gwynn, who singled on the first 
pitch he saw from Hernandez but did not get a hit against him in two 
more at-bats, said that the pitcher's composure was what struck him 
most. ``He didn't look rattled,'' said Gwynn, perhaps the finest student 
of pitchers in the game. ``He got ahead. He changed speeds. And there 
were the little subtle things, like how he moved from one side of 
the rubber to the other. But you hope the next time you face him, 
you have a 0-0 game instead of 6-0.'' Gwynn was referring to the six-run 
lead the Yankees had after two innings. And things might have been 
drastically different had O'Neill not made a leaping catch at the 
right field fence of Joyner's drive with two on and two out in the 
top of the first. ``I thought it had a chance to go out,'' Joyner 
said. ``But it had topspin, so I don't think it would have gone out.'' 
If it had, the Padres would have had a 3-0 lead. Instead, the Yankees 
jumped out to their big lead against Andy Ashby, and the Padres never 
had a chance. Afterward, the Padre hitters talked about all the angles 
from which Hernandez threw and about his ability to hit the spots 
he wanted to hit. ``I think we'll be more comfortable the next time 
we face him,'' said Greg Vaughn, who popped out to short with the 
bases loaded in the seventh as Hernandez's last batter of the night. 
But unless the Padres win a couple of games in San Diego, where Games 
4, 5 and 6 will be played beginning Tuesday night, they will not get 
that chance again. At least not this year. The Padres did not seem 
like a very confident team as they prepared to board their charter 
back to Southern California. After previous tough losses in the first 
two rounds of this post-season, the music in their clubhouse would 
be blaring _ almost as if the Padres were saying they had nothing 
to worry about. After Saturday's Game 1 loss, for example, the Ohio 
Players' 1970s hit ``Love Rollercoaster'' was playing. On Sunday night, 
however, there was silence from the stereos, and the San Diego players 
speaking in muted tones. ``I think they packed all their boxes because 
we were hitting the road,'' San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy said. ``They'll 
be fine.'' Perhaps. But without two victories out West, the Padres 
_ who have had such a great post-season thus far _ will also be staying 
put at home.
