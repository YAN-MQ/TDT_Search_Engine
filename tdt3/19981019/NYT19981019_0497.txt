The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 20: A wave 
of indictments is expected when Manhattan District Attorney Robert 
Morgenthau finishes investigating charges of embezzlement and kickbacks 
from those doing business with at least a half-dozen locals of District 
Council 37, New York City's largest municipal union. But the urgent 
business of cleaning up the union should not await the filing of criminal 
charges. A casual and clubby management style invited stealing from 
a union treasury built on dues from some of the city's hardest-working 
and lowest-paid employees. That in itself warrants immediate intervention 
by the parent union, the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees. The union should promptly put the whole district 
council into trusteeship and actively explore the possibility of new 
leadership. Stanley Hill, the union's politically powerful director, 
has not been implicated in any criminal wrongdoing. But, as Steven 
Greenhouse of The New York Times has reported, he helped invite scandal 
with his languorous approach to union finances and his curious habit 
of ignoring clear excesses. Last February, the parent union put the 
local representing cafeteria aides and crossing guards into trusteeship 
because it was $10 million in debt and had not paid $500,000 in rent. 
In June, an internal union panel expelled the local's president, Charles 
Hughes, for cheating the union of $1.7 million, including $329,000 
in credit card bills and $685,000 in fraudulent overtime. For unknown 
reasons, Hill paid the overtime bill even though the judicial panel 
found fraud. Meanwhile, members of the local representing City University's 
clerical workers have demanded an inquiry into the disappearance of 
$192,000. Mark Rosenthal, the new president of the motor vehicle operators' 
local, complains that before he took office, $92,000 was spent on 
the 1995 Christmas party and $11,000 on 250 very expensive turkeys. 
Hill and the parent union have recently adopted stricter financial 
rules. Even so, trusteeship is the only sane course until the mess 
is sorted out. District Council 37 played a proud role in helping 
rescue the city from financial distress a quarter-century ago. Now 
its own house is in shambles.
