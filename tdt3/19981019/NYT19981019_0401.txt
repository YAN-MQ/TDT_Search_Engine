Drive-by shootings and tourists getting shot in the street are not 
supposed to happen in this small city, where the average house is 
valued at more than $500,000 and the views of the ocean are priceless. 
There was only one homicide in Santa Monica in 1997. But in the past 
week, this well-off city by the sea has been rocked by three killings, 
including the slaying of a German tourist who was gunned down during 
a street robbery on the last night of his American vacation. ``It's 
like the week of death in Santa Monica,'' said Lisa Finn, a resident 
who was taking photographs on Monday of a memorial of flowers and 
candles set up for one of the victims in the parking lot of a liquor 
store. ``What's going on?'' At a crowded news conference Monday, the 
police tried to answer Ms. Finn's question. They said that there was 
``absolutely no link'' between the killing of the tourist and the 
two other slayings, which were part of a years-old street-gang rivalry. 
Chief James Butts said the rivalry involved a Santa Monica gang and 
a much larger gang from nearby Culver City and had escalated into 
``a very planned and orchestrated series of retaliations.'' ``We have 
increased security citywide,'' Butts said. ``We consider this to be 
very serious. We are out in extreme visible force.'' The stakes are 
high. Tourists from around the world pour into Santa Monica like the 
sunshine so many of them crave. They come for the weather and the 
beaches and the chance to see one of the movie stars who live here 
walking down the shop- and restaurant-lined Third Street Promenade. 
Last year nearly 2.4 million people visited Santa Monica, leaving 
behind $516 million in tourist dollars. While crime has been going 
down here, as in the rest of the country, as recently as 1991 there 
were 13 homicides. But homicides have been in the single digits every 
year since. And Butts said, ``We're not an island.'' Los Angeles is 
just next door. Asked if the city was concerned that the shootings 
might hurt tourism, Butts said, ``This is not about public relations. 
This is about public safety.'' The German tourist who was killed, 
Horst Fietze, 50, was a house painter from Loebau in eastern Germany. 
He had saved for years to vacation in the United States with his wife 
and another couple. Last Monday night, the friends were out for a 
walk. They were scheduled to fly home the next day. The Germans were 
walking behind a luxury hotel near the beach when they were approached 
by three strangers, one of whom had a gun. The strangers demanded 
money. There was a struggle, shots rang out, and Fietze's wife began 
to scream. Her husband lay dying. ``My husband is German,'' said Ms. 
Finn, who also photographed a makeshift memorial set up for Fietze, 
``and his family says the killing is really being talked about over 
there. My father-in-law calls us after every disaster and tells us 
how awful the States are.'' The police arrested two people in connection 
with the slaying, but released them because of lack of evidence. A 
couple of hours before Fietze was killed and about a half-mile away, 
Omar Sevilla, 22, was returning to a drug-rehab center when a car 
pulled up and the occupants asked him what gang he belonged to, Butts 
said. Sevilla had been a member of the Culver City gang, known as 
the Culver City Boys, but Butts said he did not know if Sevilla responded 
before he was shot and killed. Peter Tigler, a member of the Pico 
Neighborhood Association, where some of the shootings have occurred, 
said Sevilla was related to a member of the gang. The killing continued 
on Saturday, when Juan Campos, 28, was fatally shot in a market on 
Pico, where on Monday a dozen memorial candles flickered in the wind. 
On a napkin placed on a bouquet of flowers, someone had written a 
plea: ``Please stop the violence.'' Campos was a former gang member, 
the police said. On Sunday night, a 25-year-old man was shot in the 
back as he entered his car, but he was not killed. Police officers 
responding to the gunfire chased a car into a cul-de-sac. Two men, 
19 and 18, got out, one of them holding an assault rifle. The police 
fired. The men dropped the rifle and ran, but were quickly captured 
and charged with attempted murder. They were identified as members 
of the Culver City gang. ``Certainly the publicity has implied that 
people are not safe in Santa Monica,'' said a City Council member, 
Pam O'Connor. ``Nobody is happy about that. But this to us is an aberration 
and not indicative to day-to-day living in Santa Monica.''
