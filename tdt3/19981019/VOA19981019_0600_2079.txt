Rebel troops in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia have sealed 
-- seized, that is, armored vehicles, tanks and automatic weapons 
from their military brigade. President Edward Chevinatza urged the 
rebels to turn over the stolen weapons or face military force. The 
rebels are reported to have opened negotiations with government officials. 
President Chevinatza has placed the military on full alert and sent 
troops to western Georgia to prevent any possible rebel attacks. There 
were no immediate reports of fighting. More than 200 soldiers took 
part in a rebellion at the military brigade, about 160 meters east 
of the capital Tubelsi. The rebels are led by a former commander of 
an armed faction supporting the late president of the country.
