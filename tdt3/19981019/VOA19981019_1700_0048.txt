I'm Robert Burns, VOA News. President Clinton is back at the Middle 
East summit, working to win an agreement in the wake of an Arab grenade 
attack in Israel that wounded 64 people. VOA's David Gullest has the 
latest from the White House. Leaving the White House to join in a 
fifth day of summit talks, Mr. Clinton condemned the Beresheba attack 
as murder plain and simple and acknowledged it is a complicating factor 
in an already difficult summit. The issues are difficult. The distrust 
is deep. The going has been tough. But the parties must consider the 
consequences of failure and also the benefits of progress The president 
has devoted some 30 hours to the mediation effort, including marathon 
talks with, among others, the new Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon 
that extended into early Monday morning. He said reaching peace is 
the best way to assure that terrorism has no future in the region 
and that he will encourage the parties to make the hard decisions 
necessary to move the process forward. David Gullest, VOA News, the 
White House.
