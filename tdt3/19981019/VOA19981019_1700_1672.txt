In our crime and punishment department, in South Carolina, Timothy 
Dale Crockett was angry at his bank for charging huge overdraft fees. 
He was so angry, he's now accused of robbing a bank himself. A somewhat 
defiant Mr. Crockett says it's the bank that started this. In his 
words, "Banking institutions are robbing people." Mr. Crockett is 
a 34 year old student at the University of South Carolina. He says 
First Federal Bank of Spartanburg South Carolina charged him almost 
$600 in overdraft fees. The fees were imposed, he says, because his 
student loan money did not arrive in his bank account on time. However, 
it was difficult for Mr. Crockett to take his anger out on First Federal 
Bank because he wanted to stage his robbery on Saturday. Presumably 
he had classes all the other time. First Federal's branches aren't 
open on Saturday morning so Mr. Crockett says he robbed a Palmetto 
Bank because its branches are open on Saturdays. Sheriff deputies 
arrested Timothy Crockett after receiving an anonymous tip.
