an Egyptian commuter train has crashed near Alexandria, killing at 
least 45 people and injuring many more. Rescuers swarmed around the 
wreckage at a train station at Kafeil el Duwar early Monday, hours 
after the crash. Railway officials say they believe passengers tampered 
with the train's brake system.
