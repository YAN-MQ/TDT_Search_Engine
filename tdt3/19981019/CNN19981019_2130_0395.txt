The woman who says she urged Linda Tripp to begin taping some of her 
conversations with Monica Lewinsky is being subpoenaed. New York literary 
agent lucianne Goldberg and her son are being called before a grand 
jury in Maryland. Prosecutors are looking into whether Tripp broke 
state law by making the tapes. It's illegal in Maryland to record 
someone's phone conversation without consent.
