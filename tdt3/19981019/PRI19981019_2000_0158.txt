Rain continues throughout much of south central Texas as residents 
return to assess property damage. From Austin, Janet Heimlecht reports. 
Most of the hundreds of people who were evacuated in Austin have returned 
home. Many are relieved. Even homes which are next to flooded creeks 
didn't take in much water. Now cleanup is in store as debris covers 
lawns and street throughout the city. Some shops were flooded near 
downtown as the swollen creek created a three-foot high lake at a 
busy intersection. Other parts of the state, however, were hit hard. 
In Camel County near San Antonio, the Guadeloupe River tore homes 
from their foundations. Costs there are estimated to be in the millions. 
The storm also proved deadly. Over the weekend at least 14 people 
were killed by rushing water and tornadoes. Governor George W. Bush's 
plans were interrupted today by the weather. He had plan to do an 
aerial tour of the badly hit counties but had to cancel the trip due 
to rain and thunderstorms. For NPR news, this is Janet Heimlect in 
Austin.
