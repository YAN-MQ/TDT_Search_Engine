Overseas again in Kosovo today, Serb military units have moved out 
of their barracks and begin shelling ethnic Albanian villages despite 
the threat of nATO air strikes. The Serbs said they were responding 
to the killing of three Serb policeman over the weekend by ethnic 
Albanians. Because of the new fighting the United Nations has held 
back two convoys of trucks carrying aid to ethnic Albanians forced 
from their homes.
