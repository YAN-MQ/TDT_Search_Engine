Two days after Vail broke ground on a controversial ski area expansion, 
fires erupted Monday along a nearby, mile-long mountain ridge, destroying 
three major buildings and damaging four chair lifts. In a blow to 
the nation's busiest ski area, the fires leveled the resort's ski 
patrol headquarters, a mountain top shelter and picnic area, and Two 
Elk Lodge, a 500-seat restaurant. Local officials would not speculate 
on a cause. ``It is not impossible that this was an accident,'' said 
Kim Andree, a spokeswoman at the Eagle County sheriff's office, who 
said that all the buildings shared gas and electricity lines. But 
Ed Nesselroad, a spokesman here for the U.S. Forest Service, the area 
landowner, said, ``It's unlikely that it was a natural cause.'' Vail, 
which last winter sold 1.6 million lift tickets, plans to open on 
schedule, on Nov. 6, Paul Witt, a spokesman, said Monday from the 
resort, 90 miles west of here. He said that the company is evaluating 
damage to the chair lifts and is preparing an estimate of the dollar 
losses. Mud on access roads, snow on the mountain top, and the 11,200-feet 
elevation hampered the work Monday of about 100 firefighters. Three 
hours before dawn, Vail fire fighters received fire alarms from smoke 
detectors at the ski patrol building and at the restaurant, according 
to the Eagle County sheriff's office. Vail, the largest ski mountain 
in the United States, has the most expensive lift ticket announced 
for Colorado this winter, $61. This month, a poll of readers of Ski 
magazine rated Vail the top ski resort in North America. Monday's 
fires come after months of controversy surrounding a plan by Vail 
to expand into 885 acres of National Forest land. Environmental groups 
have fought the expansion, arguing that it would destroy lynx habitat 
and would further real estate development and traffic congestion on 
the edges of the White River National Forest. On Wednesday, the 10th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a request for an emergency 
injunction, clearing the way for Vail to start work. Racing the onset 
of winter, Vail started preliminary work on Friday, largely building 
fences. Tree clearing for trails and lifts was to begin later this 
week. No one has claimed responsibility for the fires, which were 
condemned by environmentalists. ``If arson is indeed the cause, we 
would hope that those responsible would be brought to justice and 
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,'' said Ted Zukowski, 
a Boulder attorney who represents six groups that filed suit last 
June to block the expansion. ``Any purposeful destruction of public 
lands resources or facilities is absolutely abhorrent to us.'' Last 
month, the expansion plan provoked the University of Colorado to cancel 
its ski bus service from the Boulder campus to four ski areas owned 
by Vail Resorts: Vail, Keystone, Breckenridge and Beaver Creek. On 
Monday, Joan Schunck, a student leader of the boycott, said, ``We 
condemn any action that is destructive and dangerous to people.'' 
Opposition to the expansion has also come from the 11th Mountain Alliance, 
a group of about 210 back country skiers and snowboarders who complain 
that Vail wants to bar them from a back country area of National Forest 
in order to compensate for the ski area's expansion into possible 
lynx habitat. Lynx have not been sighted in the disputed area since 
1973. But Zukowski noted that lynx tracks were seen there in the 1991, 
adding, ``The only reason the Forest Service has not found any lynx 
back there is they haven't looked.''
