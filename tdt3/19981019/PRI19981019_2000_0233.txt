This in NPR news. Support for National Public Radio comes from NPR 
stations and Amgen, discovering effective medicines, fighting disease 
and improving lives through biotechnology. Programming on 91 FM is 
supported by WHYY store of knowledge, offering people of all ages 
thousands of things to pick up, play with and explore, with locations 
in Cherry Hill, Willow Grove, the Court at King of Prussia and the 
Depford Mall. I'm Lisa Mullins. Whether it's the ruble, the yen, the 
frank or the pound, when currency values fluctuate, people get nervous. 
Financial jitters also make it difficult to plan a big purchase. Is 
this the best time to buy a car? Will my money be worth more if I 
wait awhile? Well, right now this station is asking you to put your 
money into public radio. Is it a good investment? Is this the best 
time to make a pledge? Unlike currency exchange rates or the cost 
of imports, the value of public radio is a constant. You depend on 
the station as a source of information and it performs for you reliably. 
And even though the cost of making radio can go up and down, we are 
not asking you to float your members share or index your pledge to 
inflation, we just want you to consider what this station is worth 
to you and call now to show your support. JOE CASUTTO PUMACO Here's 
the number to call to make a pledge to 91 FM, 215 923-1234, that's 
215 923-1234. Stick around. We've got the World coming up in just 
a moment. Hello, I'm Joe Casutto Pumaco reminding you that we're in 
the middle of our October membership drive at 91 FM and we want to 
have your membership pledge now on the line at 215 923-1234. You make 
the programs possible on this noncommercial public radio station. 
Pledge now, 215 923-1234. Thanks very much for your support. The World 
is made possible in part by Merck, pharmaceutical research dedicated 
to preventing disease and improving health. Merck, committed to bringing 
out the best in medicine.
