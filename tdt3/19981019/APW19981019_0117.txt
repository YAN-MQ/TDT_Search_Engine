A Palestinian threw two hand grenades into the central bus station 
in this desert town during morning rush hour Monday, and at least 
45 people were injured, including more than 20 soldiers. Two victims 
were in serious condition. The assailant was wrestled to the ground 
by passers-by. The attack coincided with a make-or-break Mideast peace 
summit at Wye plantation outside Washington. Israeli negotiators said 
the blasts strengthened Israel's determination not to compromise on 
demands that the Palestinians do more to prevent terror attacks. The 
explosions went off shortly after 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) in Beersheba, 
a town in the southern Negev Center. Witnesses said the assailant, 
who apparently came from the West Bank's Hebron area, carried hand 
grenades in a bag. Israel radio quoted police as saying the suspect 
wanted to harm Israeli soldiers. The radio said one grenade hit a 
bus full of passengers, but exploded some distance away. After the 
blasts, army-issue olive duffel bags and clothes were strewn on the 
pavement near one of the glass-covered bus stops. A soldier's polished 
black boots, with the socks stuffed inside, were left behind on a 
traffic island. Officials at Sorokka Hospital in Beersheba said 45 
people were injured, including two who were in serious condition. 
Most suffered only minor injuries. There was no immediate claim of 
responsibility. Israel has been on high alert for a possible terror 
attack for the past month after the Islamic militant group Hamas said 
it would carry out bombings in Israel. Hamas wants to avenge the killings 
of two Hamas top fugitives by Israeli troops in September. At the 
Mideast summit, a key issue on the agenda is Israel's demand that 
the Palestinians do more to prevent terror attacks in Israel. Netanyahu 
has said he will not hand over West Bank land until he receives ironclad 
guarantees from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Israel radio said 
Netanyahu was woken up by aides and briefed about the attack. The 
Palestinians' security chief in the West Bank, Col. Jibril Rajoub, 
said terror attacks also harmed the Palestinians because they made 
it more difficult to reach a peace agreement. ``Both sides must move 
to implement the agreement,'' Rajoub told The Associated Press. ``Israel 
must understand that security comes through peace.''
