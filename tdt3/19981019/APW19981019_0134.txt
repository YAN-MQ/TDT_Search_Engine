The designer drug ecstasy is being produced at jungle laboratories 
in Myanmar and could soon flood Thailand, driving down the price and 
making it more readily accessible, a senior anti-narcotics official 
said Monday. Thai intelligence units have reported that the Wa ethnic 
group in northern Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been producing 
ecstasy for quite some time and plans to market the illegal drug in 
Thailand next year, said Sorasit Sangprasert, deputy secretary-general 
of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board. ``We are afraid that 
this will drive down the price and make it even more accessible for 
Thais,'' said Sorasit. The street value for an ecstasy tablet from 
Europe is about 1,200 baht (dlrs 30), while one from the Wa is about 
400 baht (dlrs 10), he said. He called the development a ``grave concern'' 
for Thailand. The Wa are believed to be the top traffickers of heroin 
in Myanmar, which vies with Afghanistan for the title of world's biggest 
exporter of the drug. The Wa also make large quantities of methamphetamine, 
a stimulant, which is mostly exported to Thailand. Ecstasy, also called 
MDMA, is chemically related to amphetamines but requires a more sophisticated 
manufacturing process. Thai narcotics officials intercepted a small 
shipment of Wa-made ecstasy, which laboratory tests revealed to be 
of much lower quality than that from Europe, the main source of the 
drug, said Sorasit.
