The battle between the justice department and Microsoft is finally 
under way. Opening statements are taking place in federal court in 
Washington. The federal government, along with 20 states, is suing

filed last spring, charges Microsoft with using its dominance in personal 
computer operating systems to stamp out competition. The trial is 
expected to last three months.
