The New York Yankess have dominated the San Diego Padres nine to three 
in game number two of major league baseball's World Series. The Yankees 
pounded San Diego starting pitcher Andy Ashby for three runs in each 
of the first two innings on Sunday in New York. Another Yankee score 
in the third inning and a two run home run in the fifth inning put 
the game out of reach. New York outfielder Paul O'Neill says the Yankees 
can win a lot of different ways. We won a ton of games this year in 
different ways and with different people and it's nothing new for 
us. I mean, obviously the media hasn't seen us as much as, you know, 
we've been together. But, we have just won and in so many different 
ways this year and when we take the field we expect to win. New York 
snuffed out a San Diego rally late in the eighth inning that produced 
two runs for the Padres. The victory gives the Yankees a two to nothing 
lead in the best of seven game championship which San Diego's Tony 
Gwynn says is a little discouraging. We were down six nothing before 
we even could blink, you know. Six runs, ten hits in three innings. 
And Al Deuke's role in the long and so that part is a little disheartening 
but I think we'll be fine going home. The World Series continues Tuesday 
in San Diego. The Padres will also host game four on Wednesday and, 
if needed, game five on Thursday.
