The day's top stories are next, followed by consumer news. And still 
ahead in "lifestyles" -- taking chances is paying off for one of hollywood's 
hottest actresses. If you could accompany your data on its trip overseas 
the experience would be alarming. Local carriers handing it to national 
carriers over to cable carriers... till you don't know who has your 
data. Unless you send it through here. With the one and only company 
that owns the entire network-- local, national, and international. 
So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
