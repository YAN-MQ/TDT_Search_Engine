I'm Imani Crosby, VOA News. President Clinton has held a surprise 
late night meeting with Israeli's hard-line foreign minister, Ariel 
Sharon as the Mideast peace talks were extended at least through Monday. 
The subject of the unexpected talks at the secluded Wye River Plantation 
outside Washington was not announced. The peace talks are believed 
to be stalled over key elements of a deal on Israel's West Bank pullout 
in return for security guarantees from the Palestinians.
