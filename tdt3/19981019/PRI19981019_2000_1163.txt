Coming up next, what's up on Wall Street and is open access for the 
disabled of South Africa on PRI. The World is sponsored by the Capital 
Group Companies, investing throughout the world for individuals and 
institutions. And the World is sponsored by Merck, dedicated to the 
needs of society through pharmaceutical research and consumer education 
to improve the quality of life. Merck, committed to bringing out the 
best in medicine. You're listening to the World on 91 FM WHYY. Hello 
I'm Joe Posuto Pumaco. Taking just one minute now from the program 
to remind you that we're in the middle of 91 FM's October membership 
drive. There are 91 reasons to support 91 FM. What's your reason? 
Well, regardless of what your reason is, we encourage you, cajole 
you as a matter of fact to go to your phone and make a pledge to become 
a member of WHYY, $60, $120 perhaps at higher levels like $180 and 
when you think of it over the course of an entire year, it's really 
not that much. The phone number to call to make a pledge is 215 923-1234. 
That's 215 923-1234. You can put your pledge on VISA, Mastercard or 
American Express. Do you know a $75 pledge is just $6.25 a month? 
It's really not that much when you consider all that you get from 
public radio, 91 fm. 215 923-1234.
