And while the turmoil continues in Kosovo, democracy is being practiced 
in Macedonia. Macedonia is also a Yugoslav province and like Kosovo, 
has a large number of ethnic Albanians as residents. They do not want 
to secede from Yugoslavia, but they hope for fairer representation 
in Belgrade and took those steps to the voting booth in parliamentary 
elections. A report now from Jennifer Glass in the Macedonian capital. 
Macedonia is facing its own ethnic tensions further seeking political 
solutions. Albanians, who make up the largest minority here, say the 
government has treated them as second class citizens since independence 
from Yugoslavia in 1991. They are trying to correct that at that polls. 
More than one and a half million Macedonians are electing a new parliament. 
Two Albanian factions which were once political rivals has formed 
a united front. Their main complaints are that the government denies 
them places in universities, positions in the police and military 
and a fair share of political power. The tiny nation of Macedonia 
sits in the heart of the troubled Balkan region, wedged between Yugoslavia, 
Greece, Bulgaria and Albania. About 20,000 Albanians from Kosovo are 
in Macedonia. Macedonia is calling them guests of the government rather 
than refugees. Hundreds of NATO peacekeeping troops have been stationed 
here more than five years to ensure regional stability. Jennifer Glass
