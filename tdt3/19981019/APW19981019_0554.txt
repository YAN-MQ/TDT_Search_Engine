Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has opened preliminary takeover 
talks with Bankers Trust, according to a report Tuesday in the Financial 
Times. The possible deal, which would require the approval of the 
U.S. Federal Reserve and banking regulators in New York, would be 
the largest takeover of a U.S. bank by a non-U.S. bank, the newspaper 
said, adding that the announcement of any deal is seen as being some 
way in the future. The Financial Times says sources close to the talks, 
whom they do not name, stress the discussion is in its early stages, 
but that it is the ``key element'' of the German bank's efforts to 
acquire a leading U.S. investment bank. ``I would not call these offical 
talks, more exploratory talks,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified 
person involved as saying. ``However, it looks like it may lead to 
that.'' The newspaper said both companies declined to comment on the 
report Monday night. Senior executives at Deutsche Bank are said by 
Wall Street sources to recognize talks with Bankers Trust as offering 
the best hope of a takeover announcement before the end of the year, 
the newspaper said, adding that Bankers Trust would provide the German 
bank with a large-scale U.S. operation and U.S. clients. Bankers Trust 
is ranked by market capitalization as the 35th largest bank in the 
United States, the newspaper said.
