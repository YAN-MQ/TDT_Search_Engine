Now to the business of food, where merger mania appears to have hit 
supermarkets. The supermarket giant Kroger is gobbling up one of its 
competitors. NBC's chief financial correspondent Mike Jensen on what 
it means for you. America's largest supermarket chain, Kroger, getting 
a lot bigger. Stores in 31 states, blanketing the west, midwest, and 
south. 300,000 employees. $43 billion in sales. Together, Kroger and 
its merger partner, Fred Meyer, which owns Ralph's food4less and quality 
food centers, will have more customers than any other food chain in 
America. Ten cents of every food dollar in the United States will 
be spent in a Combined Kroger, Fred Meyer store. Great for them and 
their profits, but what about the customers? How will they make out? 
Better prices at the end of the day, five cents here, ten cents there, 
depending on the product. Everything from tacos to toothpaste. There 
are specials they do from time to time. That's because big chains 
buy in huge quantities so they get a Better deal from their suppliers 
and some of that saving is passed on to customers to get them in the 
door. That's why there's a merger frenzy. Why, the store you shop 
at may have a new corporate owner. Perhaps the biggest single reason 
they're all merging -- Wal-Mart, now the nation's third largest grocery 
chain. Selling food at discount prices, $25 billion worth a year. 
But what about competition? Do all these mergers mean fewer choices 
for shoppers? Hardly. Experts say the $430 billion-A-year grocery 
business remains one of the most competitive in the world. That almost 
every neighborhood in America has a choice from giant supermarkets 
to convenience stores to tiny fruit markets. Competition. Keeping 
prices in check. Mike Jensen, NBC news, New York.
