The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 20: The Middle 
East peace talks in Maryland are in overtime, and may yet fail. But 
they were saved from extinction Monday by some intense American diplomacy 
and the decision of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and 
the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, not to let a new terrorist 
attack in Israel abort the negotiations. The grenade assault in Beersheba 
on Monday intensified Israel's security concerns. The Maryland summit 
will not succeed unless the Palestinians demonstrate that they are 
fully committed to preventing terror attacks and cooperating with 
Israel to bring suspects to justice. But those are not the only issues 
that must be resolved. The Palestinians have grievances over Israel's 
failure to live up to past commitments, including the opening of ports 
and industrial facilities essential to Palestinian economic health. 
Israel has also backed off the promise of one additional West Bank 
withdrawal beyond the 13 percent now being discussed. These talks 
must resolve these leftover issues and lead to immediate negotiations 
on claims on Jerusalem, the future of West Bank Jewish settlements 
and the nature of a possible Palestinian state. Otherwise, the Oslo 
agreements are likely to expire unfulfilled next May, with potentially 
devastating consequences for the peace effort. Failure in Maryland 
could also weaken Washington's ability to play a constructive role 
in Mideast diplomacy. The Clinton administration has invested time 
and prestige in these negotiations. If the personal efforts of President 
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
cannot nudge Netanyahu and Arafat to an agreement, it is hard to imagine 
what will. No fair-minded person expects Israel to compromise its 
security or Arafat to accept humiliating conditions in exchange for 
Israel keeping promises it agreed to long ago. But an anxious world 
demands that both leaders keep at these negotiations and make the 
reasonable compromises necessary to save a dangerously troubled peace.
