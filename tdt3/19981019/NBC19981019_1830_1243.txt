In Las Vegas tonight, a jubilant Mike Tyson has won a big victory 
outside the ring. The Nevada athletic commission returned his license 
to box after banning him from the game last year for biting off part 
of Evander Holyfield's ear during a title bout. Tyson received support 
from magic Johnson, who told the committee he'd keep a close watch 
on the boxer.
