Brian McBride scored two goals and the Columbus Crew kept their championship 
hopes alive with a 4-2 victory over two-time Major League Soccer champions 
D.C. United on Sunday in Game 2 of the Eastern Division finals. The 
defeat broke United's streak of 13 straight playoff victories and 
evened the best-of-3 series. The deciding game will be played Wednesday 
in Washington, with the winner advancing to the MLS Cup championship 
game next Sunday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., against the 
Chicago Fire. McBride chased down a loose ball in the box and pushed 
a shot past D.C. goalkeeper Tom Presthus from 10 yards out in the 
8th minute. Thomas Dooley made it 2-0 in the 37th minute on a header 
from seven yards out off a cross from Jason Farrell. McBride got his 
fourth playoff goal and the game-winner in the 47th minute, fighting 
off two defenders and flicking a header inside the far post from 12 
yards. Reserve Tony Sanneh put United on the scoreboard with a header 
off a cross by defender Jeff Agoos in the 65th minute. Roy Lassiter 
made it 3-2 in the 77th minute after Carey Talley intercepted a rushed 
pass from Dooley. MLS scoring leader Stern John put the game away 
in the 81st minute with a header off a cross by Robert Warzycha. The 
game, which was the last the Crew will play in Ohio Stadium, featured 
an MLS record 50 fouls and seven yellow cards as the teams battled 
in a steady rain. Columbus will have its own soccer-specific stadium 
next season.
