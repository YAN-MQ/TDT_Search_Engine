Somewhere between the production of ``Wit'' at the Long Wharf Theater 
in New Haven, Conn., last November and the production of ``Wit'' that 
reopened at the MCC Theater in Manhattan this month, Kathleen Chalfant 
says, her performance got better. That, Ms. Chalfant explained over 
a bowl-size cup of coffee on a recent morning in her cozy West Village 
home, is because her older brother _ a mentor and close friend _ died 
of cancer. In ``Wit,'' Ms. Chalfant, 53, plays a woman who herself 
is dying of ovarian cancer. And after living through the death of 
her brother, Alan Palmer, on Good Friday, she said, she approached 
the play with a new level of empathy and insight. ``I'm finding that 
playing the play now is a kind of memorial to Alan,'' said Ms. Chalfant, 
who was wearing a blond wig over the head she keeps shaved for the 
role. ``It's somewhere to put both my grief at his loss and what I 
learned about dying from him.'' Ms. Chalfant's performance as a 50-year-old 
English professor, Vivian Bearing, has received unusually resounding 
critical praise. In The New York Times, Peter Marks called it ``as 
intelligent and uncompromising as you're likely to come across on 
a New York stage.'' New York Magazine called Ms. Chalfant ``a Vivian 
of power and vulnerability, commanding intelligence and compelling 
irony.'' The Daily News of New York said that Ms. Chalfant and the 
playwright, Margaret Edson, ``create the kind of moving, enthralling 
and challenging experience that reminds you what theater is for.'' 
And so on. The play has been extended at the nonprofit MCC through 
Nov. 22 and may have a future commercial run. Not only did Ms. Chalfant's 
experience with her brother help her in reapproaching the play _ it 
was he, in fact, who read the script and told her to do it in the 
first place _ but she said that having done the play helped her help 
him. ``I knew what to do,'' she said, ``and how to protect him.'' 
Palmer, a fund-raiser 14 years her senior who had an encyclopedic 
knowledge of opera and ballet, lived with Ms. Chalfant for the last 
two years of his life, occupying one of the apartments in the town 
house that she and her husband also share with a cousin and his wife. 
Ms. Chalfant slept in a chair in her brother's hospital room during 
her brother's final days and was there when he died. ``He was my glamorous 
relative,'' she said. ``He encouraged me to be an actor. He took it 
seriously.'' Among the things her brother's experience taught her, 
Ms. Chalfant said, was what happens at the end. In the play, she collapses 
into bed the way her brother did, remembering how his body simply 
stopped working. And she plays her final scene _ in which her former 
English professor reads ``The Runaway Bunny'' to her _ with an understanding 
of how the mind of an ill person makes its own reality. ``In the last 
few days of his life, Ms. Chalfant said of her brother, ``he began 
to tell stories to people who came that were hallucinations, but he 
narrated them in a perfectly clear way. I realized that at the end 
of your life, it doesn't matter whether something is objectively real 
to the outside world or not. There isn't any experiential difference 
between what we call reality and hallucination.'' The play has also 
allowed Ms. Chalfant to draw on her experience studying the classics 
in graduate school at Stanford University. In ``Wit'' her character 
specializes in the Holy Sonnets of the 17th-century poet John Donne. 
To prepare for the role, Ms. Chalfant said she read a great deal about 
Donne, including a 1989 article by Richard Strier mentioned in the 
script. To better understand the medical details in the play when 
they were performing at the Long Wharf, Ms. Chalfant and her fellow 
cast members took field trips to Yale-New Haven Hospital and talked 
with nurses, who evaluated the play's medical procedures for authenticity. 
Ms. Chalfant also had her brother reread the play to make sure it 
rang true to his experience, and he saw it performed twice before 
he died. The play's director, Derek Anson Jones, said he had noticed 
a change in Ms. Chalfant's performance from one production to another. 
``There is a level of true fear and dislocation that she brings, which 
I think adds greater resonance to the work,'' he said. Ms. Chalfant 
was born in San Francisco and spent much of her childhood in Oakland, 
where her parents ran a 50-room boarding house for working people 
that served two hot meals a day, six days a week. She met her husband, 
the filmmaker Henry Chalfant, in college and married him after she 
graduated in 1966. Their son, David, 30, is a bass player in the Nields, 
a folk fusion band. Their daughter, Andromache, 26, a painter, who 
has been working as a set designer for film and theater. The last 
time Ms. Chalfant was praised so thoroughly was in 1993, for her portrayal 
of multiple parts in ``Angels in America,'' for which she received 
a Tony award nomination. Since then she has appeared steadily in productions 
off-Broadway and at regional theaters, including the Hartford Stage 
Company in Connecticut and Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Still, 
she said she had not expected to be so warmly embraced, particularly 
in the role of a dying woman who lectures about Donne. ``When we first 
did the play, I wasn't sure whether or in what way it was redemptive,'' 
she said. ``Here, the response to the play has been overwhelmingly 
powerful, and overwhelmingly positive.'' ``I'm very happy for everyone,'' 
she said.
