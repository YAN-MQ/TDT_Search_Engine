When we come back -- dying for a drink. Binge drinking on campus and 
the new effort to turn off the tap. The 300 idea is the idea of a 
powerful, responsive, nimble automotive machine. The all-new '99 Chrysler 
300m. The most powerful sports sedan in its class. As long as I've 
worked on this engine, I still get a tingle every time we open the 
hood. The Chrysler 300m. The technology has changed but the soul lives 
on.
