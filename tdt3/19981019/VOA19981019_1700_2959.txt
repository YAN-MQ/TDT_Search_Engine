It's time now for business news. Stock prices were up Monday here 
in the United States as the rally continued, following a cut in U.S. 
interest rates last week. VOA correspondent Elaine Johannsen has more 
on the story from New York. After flirting throughout the day with 
the 8,500 level, the Dow Jones Industrial average finally settled 
down to close at 8,466, a gain of 49 points. Standard and Poores 500 
index also closed up nearly six points. It was generally a lackluster 
day on Wall Street. Volume was moderate. Nothing much was stirring 
internationally. Analysts said the market is looking for direction, 
although it remains quietly optimistic. Many on Wall Street believe 
the market is regaining its health. Monday's rally was clearly a continuing 
reaction to last week's cut in U.S. interest rates, the second in 
three weeks. Investors are hoping the U.S. Central Bank will make 
a third cut before the year is out. Elaine Johannsen, VOA News, New 
York.
