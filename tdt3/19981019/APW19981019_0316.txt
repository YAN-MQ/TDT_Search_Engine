Albert Costa of Spain and the Netherlands' Jan Siemerink, two seeded 
players, suffered shock defeats on the first day of the high-profile 
Lyon Grand Prix tennis tournament Monday. Costa, the world No. 16 
and sixth seed here, was beaten by 19-year-old Frenchman Arnaud Di 
Pasquale, 7-5, 6-3. ``Beating a top 50 player is my ambition for the 
year so I am delighted with the result,'' Di Pasquale said after the 
match. ``I am not too well-known and perhaps I was underestimated, 
which worked to my advantage.'' After taking the first set 7-5, Di 
Pasquale broke Costa's serve to go 4-2 ahead in the second set after 
a Costa double fault. Di Pasquale was full of confidence and served 
two aces - one a second serve - in the final game to win in just one 
hour, 18 minutes. No. 5 seed Siemerink was beaten by veteran Italian 
Gianluca Pozzi in three sets. Dutchman Siemerink, who recently won 
the Toulouse Open, seemed on course for victory after coasting through 
the first set, 6-2. But a resurgent Pozzi, ranked 58 in the world 
-- 43 places below Siemerink -- quickly improved his first serve and 
put the No. 5 seed under pressure with a series of fine forehand returns. 
After winning the second set 6-4, Pozzi won a vital service break 
in the third game of the final set and broke again to go 4-1 ahead. 
Siemerink broke back immediately and, at 4-3, had a chance to go level 
with the score at 0-30. But the 33-year-old Italian hit a stunning 
forehand to get back into the game and ran out a comfortable winner 
against a dejected Siemerink. French No. 1 Cedric Pioline, a two-time 
Lyon finalist, was the only seeded player to win Monday, winning a 
tough match against countryman Sebastien Grosjean 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 
6-1 in two hours 12 minutes. France's Nicolas Escude, pvs 7th graf
