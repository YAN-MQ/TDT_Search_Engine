The woman who says she urged Linda Tripp to start taping her chats 
with monica Lewinsky is being subpoenaed. New York literary agent 
lucianne Goldberg and her son are being called before a Maryland grand 
jury. Prosecutors are looking into whether Tripp broke state law by 
making the tapes. It's illegal in Maryland to record a person's phone 
conversation without their consent.
