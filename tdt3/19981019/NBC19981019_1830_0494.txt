Now to the computer giant, Microsoft. And the world's richest man, 
Bill Gates. There is no question it dominates the computer software 
market. But is Microsoft abusing that power? That's the centerpiece 
of the justice department's anti-trust case against microsoft, which 
is of course associated with NBC news. Pete Williams tonight. Microsoft 
is so dominant that it's windows computer program touches virtually 
all Americans either because they own it, use it at work, or do business 
with someone who does. It runs 90% of the personal computers sold 
today. But the government claims that Microsoft holds a monopoly by 
illegally intimidating the competition. To harm competition and to 
harm consumers, to limit what products can come to market, and to 
prevent people with new and better ideas from getting a Fair chance. 
Exhibit a -- a meeting Microsoft officials had three years ago with 
rival software company Netscape. Government lawyers today accused 
Microsoft of illegally trying to stop netscape from selling its program 
to the windows users. In a videotape shown in court, Microsoft's billionaire 
founder, Bill Gates, told the justice department he didn't know about 
the Netscape strategy. But government lawyers showed excepts from 
Gates' own company E-mail messages, urging his executives to shut 
Netscape out. Microsoft says those comments are just snippets, out 
of context. And it warns that the government is trying to meddle in 
the fastest growing part of the U.S. economy. The software industry 
itself is intensely innovative and competitive. Every year, there 
are thousands of new products brought to market. There are thousands 
of new companies being formed. The company insists it must be free 
to add new features to its products, and some say there is always 
a risk when the government steps in to a wide open business. The whole 
high-tech industry, the computer industry, has been a wonderful wild 
and woolly free for all. Dodge city in the 1880's. This isn't a jury 
trial. So the issue for the judge -- has Microsoft illegally locked 
up the business, so the next Bill Gates doesn't stand a chance? As 
for how big the company is, consider this. Government lawyers prepared 
their legal briefs using the justice department's latest soft wear, 
Windows 95. Pete Williams, NBC news, Washington.
