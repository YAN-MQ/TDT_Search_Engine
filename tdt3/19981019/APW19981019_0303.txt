Hundreds of people converged on this small Nigerian town over the 
weekend, drawn by rumors of spilled gasoline free for the taking _ 
and at least 500 were killed when the fuel erupted into a ball of 
fire, officials said Monday. With dozens of charred, unidentified 
bodies littering the town and flames still occasionally flaring up

stopped fighting the flames and waited for the blaze, which spread 
thick black smoke for miles (kilometers) around, to burn itself out.
