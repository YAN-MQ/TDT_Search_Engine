At the end of the last television season, Fox was hot. So hot that 
at NBC, the prime-time leader, executives were eyeing the young network 
in their rear-view mirror when calculating how to replace ``Seinfeld'' 
on Thursday nights. The possibility of a Fox invasion featuring ``The 
Simpsons,'' ``King of the Hill'' and ``Ally McBeal'' on Thursdays 
helped lead the network to move its best comedy weapon, ``Frasier,'' 
into the ``Seinfeld'' spot. At the time, Fox was so robust that some 
of its executives countenanced the possibility that with the World 
Series and the Super Bowl on the network this season, and a hoped-for 
hit new show here and there, they might seriously challenge NBC in 
the competition among young-adult viewers (that 18-to-49-year-old 
group), which both networks regard as the true prime-time television 
championship. Four weeks into the new television season, the heat 
wave of last spring is a fast-fading memory. A batch of new Fox shows 
have gone sour quickly; and for the moment, Fox has retreated to its 
old strategy of filling the black holes on its schedule with critically 
ridiculed (though usually ratings-reliable) specials typified by this 
year's newest entry, ``When Good Pets Go Bad.'' The network, whose 
second-place finish to NBC among 18-to-49-year-olds last season was 
the most notable achievement in its 12-year history, has fallen off 
11 percent in that category this season, and suddenly finds itself 
in fourth _ and last _ place trailing even CBS, which for years has 
been written off as the network for old people. Fox's bad luck may 
even extend to the World Series this week. The network's expectation 
for a surge of buoyant ratings from the games is threatened by the 
possibility that the Yankees will run the Padres off the air in four 
nights. For any network, getting at least a six-game series is essential, 
not only to pay off the rights fee for the games but also to give 
as much additional juice as possible to its overall prime-time ratings. 
Fox's riskiest move of the season was shifting the animated show ``King 
of the Hill'' from Sunday, where it was a hit, to Tuesday, where it 
has gotten off to a rocky start. Four other Fox comedies, ``Costello,'' 
``Living in Captivity,'' ``Holding the Baby'' and ``Getting Personal,'' 
all with live people, have already been jettisoned, underscoring the 
longtime Fox problem of establishing noncartoon comedy hits. That 
leaves Fox with one new comedy, ``That '70s Show,'' which has performed 
passably on Sundays but less well than ``King of the Hill'' did in 
the same spot last year. ``The Simpsons,'' now paired with ``That 
'70s Show,'' has suffered a falloff of more than 10 percent on Sundays 
so far as well. At a network known for being fiercely competitive, 
this is not the type of outcome that is shrugged off. An executive 
at Fox's sister studio, 20th Television, said that the network ``is 
pushing for product,'' citing recent questions from Fox about when 
a comedy, ``Killer Ap,'' and a drama, ``Rosewell High,'' might be 
ready. But Peter Roth, the president of Fox Entertainment, said there 
was no rush to bring in new shows and dismissed any notion that Fox 
was feeling overly stressed. ``We feel the best is yet to come,'' 
he said. ``Check back with us at the end of November.'' He added, 
``It reminds me of 1996.'' That year Fox got off to a stumbling start, 
only to right itself in November, add ``King of the Hill'' in January, 
and tie ABC for second place in the 18-to-49 competition. (Fox executives 
also pointed out Monday that in 1996 Fox also had a World Series in 
which one team dominated the first two games, but the other team, 
the Yankees that year, came back to win in six.) It doesn't help that 
Fox is playing without its clean-up hitter. This season, as in the 
last several seasons, ``The X Files'' will offer no new episodes until 
November. And once again postseason baseball, which Roth described 
as ``a great asset for our company,'' has put Fox's schedule into 
a squeeze, pre-empting shows and offering opportunity for some competitors. 
One competitor, WB, is an emerging force for Fox to reckon with because 
it attracts the same young audience. And WB has done well establishing 
some shows this fall, including two on Wednesdays, ``Dawson's Creek'' 
and ``Charmed,'' which are geared toward taking viewers away from 
Fox's ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Party of Five.'' Last week WB, 
with a much weaker group of stations, held Fox to a standstill on 
Wednesday. But Roth pointed out that because his network had expected 
to broadcast a playoff game, neither Fox series had an original episode. 
A week earlier a game was delayed more than two hours by rain. ``It's 
been a confluence of bad luck'' on Wednesdays, Roth said. Overall, 
Roth acknowledged, Fox has tripped this fall. ``Obviously we've made 
some mistakes,'' he said. ``We've had some program failure and some 
scheduling miscues.'' In the latter category he put the move of two 
of the now vanished comedies, ``Living in Captivity'' and ``Getting 
Personal,'' to Fridays. These not only failed dismally but they also 
hurt the network's 9 p.m. drama, ``Millennium.'' Fox has now slotted 
a similar dark drama with supernatural overtones, ``Brimstone,'' in 
that hour. But Roth defended the ``King of the Hill'' move, saying 
it was ``part of our long-term strategy.'' Another part is ``That 
'70s Show,'' which Roth predicted would eventually ``emerge as a true 
winner for us.'' Mainly, Roth said, Fox has previously proved that 
it can turn its seasons around. ``We pride ourselves on our ability 
to make quick decisions,'' he said. And the network has one significant 
advantage. It fills only 15 hours a week compared with 22 for the 
other big networks. So for the November sweep rating period, Fox expects 
to be highly competitive, pursuing, as it always does, a strategy 
of removing almost all the weak hours on its schedule and replacing 
them with special programs. This year these will range from the first 
television broadcast of the box-office hit ``Jurassic Park II: The 
Lost World'' to the Fox roster of video specials. This year the specials 
include ``The World's Most Shocking Moments Caught on Tape,'' (``courtroom 
brawls, and a mudslide devouring an entire street'') and surely the 
month's highlight, ``When Good Pets Go Bad'' (``stunning footage of 
cats, dogs, horses and even snakes getting out of control''). If November 
can start a turnaround, Roth said, the network should be able to hold 
on until three new animated shows it has high hopes for are ready 
to go on the schedule after the first of the year: ``Futurama,'' ``The 
PJ's'' and ``Family Guy.'' Of course, the Super Bowl might help, too. 
``We have lost some of the momentum we had last season,'' Roth said. 
``Admittedly we had a tough third quarter. But in the fourth quarter, 
we're looking to intercept the pass and regain the momentum.''
