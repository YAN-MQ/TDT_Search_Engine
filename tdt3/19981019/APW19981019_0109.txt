Manila's influential Roman Catholic archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin 
has developed pneumonia while in the hospital and will have to remain 
there a while longer, his spokesman said Monday. Msgr. Socrates Villegas 
said the 70-year-old prelate ``developed a pulmonary congestion due 
to his disposition to retain fluids in his body.'' Villegas said Sin 
continues to undergo regular dialysis due to renal problems and doctors 
are monitoring his condition. Sin was hospitalized Sept. 28 with fever 
and stomach pains after a tube inserted in his peritoneum, the membrane 
lining the abdominal cavity, apparently introduced bacteria into his 
system, church officials said. Sin helped bring about the ouster of 
strongman Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 when he called for citizens to 
support a military revolt against the president. Hundreds of thousands 
of people rallied in the streets, forcing Marcos from power. He continues 
to be heavily involved in political and social issues in the Philippines, 
Asia's only predominantly Catholic country.
