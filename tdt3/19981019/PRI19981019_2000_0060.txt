Middle east summit talks bogged down today over an Israeli proposal 
to restrict an interim peace deal with the Palestinians. Palestinian 
President Yassar Arafat rejects the partial deal and President Clinton 
has led intensive talks tonight to bridge the differences. Earlier 
today, Israel announced that it wants only to discuss security issues 
after today's grenade attack that wounded more than 60 people in the 
southern Israel city of Yoshiba.
