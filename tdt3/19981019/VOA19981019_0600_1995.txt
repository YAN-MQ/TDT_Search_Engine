More than 400 people in southern Nigeria burned to death yesterday 
when a ruptured gasoline pipeline exploded into a huge fireball that 
incinerated several villages near and oil town. Hundreds more were 
reported hospitalized near the town of Warrey and a report by Reuters 
says at least five of the injured were dying every hour early Monday. 
Many of those dead were reported scavenging for spilled fuel at the 
site of the pipeline breach when pools of gasoline exploded. There 
are conflicting reports about the cause of this blast. Reuters quotes 
a pipeline maintenance official as saying the cause was sabotage. 
The Associated Press, however, quotes other officials as saying thieves 
may have triggered the blast while trying to siphon off gasoline from 
the pipeline which runs from Warrey to the northern city of Kaduna.
