Firefighters have their hands full in southern California, where they're 
battling two fires. The first started Friday and has charred 2,300 
acres of rocky terrain in the Los padres national forest, northeast 
of Santa Barbara. The other blaze is burning in eastern Ventura county. 
It was threatening some homes before it shifted direction. More than 
1,000 firefighters are involved in battling the fires.
