Somehow it is not a surprise that Harvey Keitel is a former Marine. 
Or that he longs to go to war with the Marines every time there is 
action. Or that every Marine he meets is an instant brother. ``There's 
been this journey, this rite of passage, of feeling like a man,'' 
Keitel said last week. Ask anybody who knows him: Harvey just loves 
the Marines. So on Nov. 10, this tough-guy actor who projects such 
complicated rage on screen will head for the Hudson River and preside 
over what is billed as the first U.S. Marine Corps Birthday Ball aboard 
the aircraft carrier Intrepid. There will be Marine celebrations all 
over the world on the same day, just as there are every year when 
the Marines lay down their arms, put on their dress uniforms and commemorate 
the birth of the corps on Nov. 10, 1775. (The Continental Congress 
commissioned a Marine battalion to fight the British from warships; 
the first battle was in the Bahamas, where the Marines went ashore 
and raided a British fort.) There has been, of course, a lot of war 
and history since then, but the Marines have always inspired a cultlike 
devotion among their members. They remain the smallest in number of 
the four branches of the Armed Forces _ 174,000 men and women, or 
about 12 percent of the military _ but according to them, they're 
the toughest. In recent years, the Marines were the first conventional 
forces in Kuwait and Somalia. They have not been plagued by the sex 
scandals of the Navy and the Air Force, and military analysts say 
their training has adapted them well to the flare-ups of the post-cold 
war world. In any case, the Intrepid ball has been organized by Keitel 
and Gerry Byrne, the publisher of Variety and another avid former 
Marine. ``We're all kind of crazy,'' Byrne said. Together, he and 
Keitel have created a celebrity Marine ball. Among the former Marines 
on the dinner committee: actor Gene Hackman, writer William Styron, 
talk-show host Montel Williams, columnist Art Buchwald, restaurateur 
Vincent Sardi and Police Commissioner Howard Safir. Keitel's pals, 
actor Robert De Niro and director Martin Scorsese, who only seem like 
former Marines, are expected, too. ``We had an experience becoming 
Marines that was important to all of us in a deeply spiritual way,'' 
said Keitel, who talked for a few hours in his TriBeCa office, a big 
open space of black leather furniture and exposed brick across the 
street from the TriBeCa Grill. Keitel, 59, who made his reputation 
with De Niro in Scorsese's ``Mean Streets'' in 1973, was unshaven, 
intense and friendlier than the nasties he plays on screen. Although 
his career never soared as De Niro's and Scorsese's did after ``Mean 
Streets,'' he starred in the Jane Campion film ``The Piano,'' was 
nominated for an Academy Award for his performance as the mobster 
Mickey Cohen in ``Bugsy,'' and has carved out a niche as one of the 
more watchable tough guys on screen. Keitel said he couldn't explain 
how he did it. ``Most certainly you're living through real emotion,'' 
he said. ``You don't fake anything.'' And yet, ``having anger in one's 
life is not the answer to becoming an actor. It's a much more complicated 
thing. There's a mystery that happens. There's an unknown in answering 
your question. That unknown is part of the answer. And I mean it. 
All this mumbo jumbo is your answer.'' Keitel grew up in the Brighton 
Beach section of Brooklyn, across the street from his parents' luncheonette, 
spent his days on the Coney Island boardwalk, and was a bad student 
at Lincoln High School. He transferred to Alexander Hamilton, a vocational 
school, although he was unclear about what his vocation was. ``I don't 
know,'' he said. ``Maybe it was shop metal? I remember I made a hammer.'' 
He dropped out at 17, joined the Marines, and was stunned by the famously 
brutal basic training, especially a night combat class in which he 
learned to function in the dark. ``It's like an actor creating a role,'' 
he said. ``You live in the circumstances of the character.'' By the 
summer of 1958, Keitel was sent to Beirut, where Communists were threatening 
the pro-West government, then volunteered to stay on through September. 
``I was on an incredible adventure there,'' Keitel said. ``I was excited 
about being a Marine in Beirut, about protecting people, about doing 
what's good. I was feeling somewhat heroic.'' Keitel got his high 
school equivalency diploma in the Marines, was discharged in July 
1959, then returned to Brooklyn. He couldn't get into college because 
he didn't have the grades or the money, and so spent nearly a decade 
as a court stenographer while going to auditions and acting school 
at night. In 1968, a young filmmaker at New York University, Scorsese, 
hired Keitel to appear in a student film he was making on weekends. 
Five years later came ``Mean Streets.'' Keitel has one child, Stella, 
12, from his former relationship with actress Lorraine Bracco. Keitel 
will wear a tuxedo to the ball, not his old uniform. ``No. 1, I'm 
a former Marine,'' he said. ``No. 2, I couldn't fit into my uniform.'' 
And he will go first as Harvey Keitel, actor. ``It's been a long journey 
to go as Harvey Keitel,'' he said. ``Don't take it from me now.''
