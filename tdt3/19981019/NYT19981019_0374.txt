Continental Airlines reported record third-quarter earnings Monday, 
excluding a previously announced one-time charge, and acknowledged 
publicly for the first time that the Clinton administration might 
file suit to block Northwest Airlines from buying a controlling stake 
in Continental. Continental said its earnings declined 34 percent, 
to $73 million, because of a $77 million after-tax charge to retire 
older jets. Excluding the charge, however, the airline's profit soared 
more than 31 percent, to $150 million, or $1.94 a diluted share, from 
$114 million, or $1.48 a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. 
The average estimate of Wall Street analysts polled by the First Call 
Corp., which tracks company earnings, was $1.93 a share. Revenue grew 
12 percent in the quarter, to $2.11 billion, compared with $1.89 billion 
in 1997 as Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, continued 
to profit from a surge in air travel. On average, Continental's flights 
were a record 76 percent full over the summer, a level that only a 
few years ago seemed unattainable. In a teleconference with reporters 
Monday, Continental executives were bullish about the future. Gregory 
Brenneman, the company's president and chief operating officer, said 
that bookings for the fourth quarter looked strong. Shares of Continental 
rose $2.125, to $41.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. As strong 
as passenger demand remains this year, however, airline stocks have 
declined sharply since the summer because investors are concerned 
about an economic slowdown in 1999 when the overall number of airplanes 
seats is expected to grow. ``They continue to outpace the industry 
in capacity growth,'' said Susan Donofrio, an airline industry analyst 
at BT Alex. Brown. ``Given the uncertainty over the economic outlook, 
it is definitely a concern for us.'' Continental, which prides itself 
on having the best labor relations in the industry, is also in the 
midst of contentious negotiations with its 1,200 commuter pilots. 
The Independent Association of Continental Pilots, which represents 
them as well as Continental's 5,000 main line pilots, has vowed to 
walk out if the airline does not improve its offer. ``Gordon is drinking 
his own Kool-Aid if he thinks the pilot work force is squarely behind 
him,'' Bill Borrelli, the union's president, said in a recent interview, 
referring to Gordon Bethune, Continental's chief executive. Bethune 
said he hoped that negotiations this week would result in an agreement 
with the pilots. He also said he expected negotiations with the Justice 
Department's antitrust division over Northwest's bid to buy a 51 percent 
stake in Continental from Air Partners, a Texas investment group, 
to be resolved ``shortly.'' As previously reported, the government 
may file suit to block the Northwest investment and plans by the two 
carriers to enter into a strategic alliance. Although one deadline 
for the government passed on Monday, the two sides have agreed to 
keep negotiating. ``At this point, we can't predict whether the Justice 
Department's concerns will be addressed by agreement or by litigation,'' 
Jeffery Smisek, Continental's general counsel, said in a statement. 
If the government does sue, Northwest and Continental are expected 
to challenge the government in court because they think they have 
a strong case. Bethune said Continental, based in Houston, would most 
likely remain profitable for the foreseeable future without the Northwest 
alliance but that its profits would be much greater if the deal went 
forward. ``It is not necessary to us,'' he said, ``but it would be 
tremendously beneficial to us.''
