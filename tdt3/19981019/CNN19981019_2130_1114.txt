It's full speed ahead in California's Silicon Valley. "Working ahead" 
highlights the inaugural run of the new Altamont commuter express 
trains today. They can carry 800 passengers each -- a welcome relief 
for the estimated 36,000 people who commute as far as 100 miles from 
the San Joaquin valley to the Silicon Valley every day. Monthly passes 
range from $59 to $279, depending on the distance.
