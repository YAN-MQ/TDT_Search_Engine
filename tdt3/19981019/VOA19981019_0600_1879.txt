Well, danger is already in evidence in Bereshaba. At least 45 people 
have been injured in a grenade attack at a bus station in the southern 
Israeli town. More than 20 Israeli soldiers were among the wounded. 
Ross Dunn in Jerusalem reports officials say two of the victims were 
injured seriously. A senior Israeli police officer told Israeli Army 
Radio that one Arab man had been arrested and he had confessed to 
carrying out the attack. Witnesses heard two blasts at Bereshaba's 
main bus station at about 8 a.m., local time, at the height of the 
morning rush hour. One man said he saw crowds of people running from 
the station after the first explosion and heard a second blast about 
five seconds later. There have been no claims of responsibility but 
the militant Islamic group Hamas has been warning that it would carry 
out attacks to avenge the deaths of two of its leaders shot dead last 
month by Israeli soldiers. Bus stations and other crowded areas have 
in the past been selected as targets for attack by Palestinian militant 
from Hamas and other Islamic movements opposed to peace making with 
Israeli. The explosions occurred as talks in the United States between 
Israeli and Palestinian leaders were extended for an unscheduled fifth 
day Monday after the two sides failed to close gaps on a new peace 
agreement. The Palestinians have been demanding that Israeli hand 
over more territory in the West Bank. But Israeli says such land transfers 
are conditional on the Palestinian authority halting terrorist attacks 
by militant groups against Israeli citizens. Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in the United 
States for the summit talks, were awakened early on Monday to be briefed 
about the attack. The incident is expected to lead to calls from right 
wing members of Mr. Netanyahu's coalition to suspend negotiations 
and return home without signing any new accord with the Palestinians.
