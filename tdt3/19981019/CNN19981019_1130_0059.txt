President Clinton returns to the wye river conference center in hopes 
of completing a half unfinished peace accord. The president is scheduled 
to leave the White House at this hour. Yesterday, Mr. Clinton and 
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed on a partial peace 
plan. Under the plan, Israel would withdraw from part of the West 
Bank now and agree to several smaller demands. Talks on other issues 
would then continue next month. Palestinian authority President Yasser 
Arafat rejected the idea. Arafat wants a complete agreement.
