Also expected November 17th is a new double CD Live set by Garth Brooks. 
If you're planning to head out and purchase the new Garth Brooks' 
Live CD, you may want to consider also picking up a copy of Garth's 
Christmas record, Beyond the Season. That album was originally released 
in 1992 and now, after selling millions and millions of copies, Garth 
says that it's going out of circulation after the first of the year. 
But as you might expect of Garth, he is planning a brand new Christmas 
album for 1999 or possibly the year 2000.
