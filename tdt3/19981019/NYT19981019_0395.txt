As peace talks in Maryland entered their fifth day, a grenade attack 
on a busy bus terminal in this modern desert town Monday left 67 people 
wounded, one gravely, and cast a shadow over the fragile negotiations. 
It began when a Palestinian man ran wildly through the bustling station 
during the morning rush hour, drawing notice just as he hurled a grenade 
at a shelter filled with young soldiers. The soldiers heard a hissing 
sound and leaped to their feet screaming, before the explosion chased 
and knocked them down. There was a silence, followed by the boom of 
a second grenade as the soldiers, nose to the asphalt, realized that 
they were the victims of a terrorist attack. Then the incident ended 
as sloppily as it began when the attacker ran into a stopped bus whose 
driver pummeled him and held him for the police. By Middle Eastern 
standards, it was an unsophisticated attack, although it could not 
have been better timed to disrupt the peace talks. No group admitted 
it. Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the leader of the militant Islamic organization 
Hamas, said he did not know if his group was responsible, since, he 
said, its political and military wings are separate. But he endorsed 
the attack in spirit. ``The occupation exists, the resistance continues 
and this is a link in a chain,'' he said. About a third of the wounded 
were uniformed soldiers and military students on their way back to 
a nearby army base and school after a weekend break. Like the civilians 
_ commuters and bus station employees _ most suffered superficial 
but painful shrapnel wounds. At noontime they lay surrounded by flowers, 
relatives and army buddies at the Soroka Hospital here, many with 
cellular phones tucked by their sides. All wore tags with their victim 
numbers, which had been chalked into the asphalt at the bus station, 
marking where they had fallen. Tamar Glustron and Shelly Bental, both 
19, friends and military police officers, had been chatting about 
clothes when they first noticed the man and heard the sibiliant sound 
as he pulled his grenade key. Later that morning, stunned, they rested 
side by side in hospital beds, pierced by shrapnel. Plastered with 
bandages, they whimpered with pain and tried to put on brave faces 
after a visit from President Ezer Weizman. ``I remember,'' Ms. Glustron 
said, ``pulling myself to my feet and thinking: `No way. He wanted 
to kill me. He wanted to kill all of us.' What for? It's for nothing 
that I was hurt. They feel so helpless they know only to talk with 
violence. It's very sad.'' Her mother, Hannah, sat bedside, squeezing 
her daughter's hand. ``The peace process should be accelerated so 
these things don't happen again,'' she said. At the hospital, Dr. 
Naftali Meidan, the deputy director, said two patients, a 14-year-old 
boy and a 17-year-old girl, were in serious condition after shrapnel 
penetrated their abdomens and chests. A 47-year-old man was listed 
in critical condition after undergoing hours of surgery. Police said 
the Palestinian, a West Bank resident, had confessed to the attack. 
At a roadblock near Hebron, they later arrested four other young Palestinian 
men driving an Audi, whom they suspected of being his accomplices. 
An Israeli radio report said the attacker lived in Dahariya, a southern 
West Bank town under Israeli security control. But Palestinian security 
officials have identified him as Salem Rajab al-Sarsour, 29, a construction 
worker and father of five from the Palestinian side of Hebron, Reuters 
reported. His wife, in traditional Islamic dress and sitting beneath 
a poster of Sheik Yassin, said she would give praise to God if her 
husband turned out to be the assailant _ ``a fighter for the sake 
of God,'' Reuters said. Mordechai Nachmani, the police commander of 
the Negev region, said, ``The person we are holding has told us that 
those who put him up to it suggested this location as a target.'' 
Speaking on Israeli radio, the bus driver said, ``He ran into the 
bus and fell.'' The driver, Avner Yaakov, continued: ``I fell on him. 
I gave him a few good wallops, and within seconds civil defense police 
had him in handcuffs.'' Beersheba, a quiet, economically depressed 
town where Israeli-born Jews, Israeli Arabs, Russian immigrants and 
Bedouins coexist, has been immune from serious terrorist attacks until 
now, even though it lies just south of the West Bank. The usual frenzy 
that follows such attacks was absent. There were few protesters, and 
none shouting, ``Death to the Arabs.'' A couple of hours after the 
attack, as workers scrubbed blood and flesh off the sidewalk, normal 
business resumed at the bus station. ``We cannot function in fear,'' 
said Eli Cohen, 38, a bus driver. ``I do take precautions, like looking 
at each passenger. If I see someone who looks suspicious, who looks 
Arab or is carrying a bag, I can stop and ask him for an ID, or take 
the bus right over to the police station.'' People even awaited their 
buses in the remains of the shelter that had been blown nearly to 
bits. One, Sarah Waltner, a Holocaust survivor with numbers tattooed 
on her forearm, perched on the edge of a ragged chair that had lost 
its back. ``I'm never afraid,'' she said. ``He who is destined to 
meet death can't escape his destiny. What can we do? Even if it is 
unusual in Beersheba, as a people we are used to it.''
