A cigar was held snugly between the fingers of Orlando Hernandez as 
he confidently strolled down a corridor after Game 2 of the World 
Series. He had just huffed and puffed and blown the Padres down, and 
the cigar was the Cuban pitcher's reward. But it was not as if the 
Yankee pitcher had just plucked it out of a cigar box being passed 
around the clubhouse on Sunday night. There was no cause for celebration 
after taking a 2-0 lead in the World Series. No reason to warm up 
the convertibles for a parade. If anyone knows the flimsiness of a 
2-0 lead in the World Series, it is the Yankees. It was just two years 
ago when the Yankees wrote the inspirational guide on comebacks as 
they recovered from a 2-0 deficit and stunned the Atlanta Braves to 
win the Series. ``We know it can be done, because we were down, 2-0, 
in '96,'' Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter said after the Yankees won, 
9-3, on Sunday night. ``San Diego is not going to give up. They are 
going to play every game from here on out like it's Game 7.'' The 
measure of the Padres' desperation will be on display for Game 3 in 
San Diego Tuesday night. David Cone will start for the Yankees. And 
providing that he is healthy enough, Sterling Hitchcock will pitch 
for the Padres. Perhaps going home will be the perfect antidote for 
the untimely ills that have left the Padres' pitching staff swilling 
chicken soup. Even Kevin Brown, the Padre ace with the steel-plated 
intensity, was left popping antibiotics before and after his unsteady 
outing in Game 1. ``The one concern is this bug that's going around,'' 
Padre Manager Bruce Bochy said. ``It hit the pitching staff, and that 
does affect you.'' There is a trickle-down effect that has helped 
the Yankees avoid facing the devilish stare of closer Trevor Hoffman. 
Either because of sickness or the fact that the Yankees will foul 
off a half dozen pitches to get the one they want, the Padre starters 
have worn down early. ``We are being patient,'' Jeter said. ``We are 
running the counts in our favor. If you do that, you can take advantage 
of their mistakes.'' Bernie Williams was proof of that. He took the 
first two pitches for strikes from the Game 2 starter, Andy Ashby, 
in the second inning, then worked the count full as he fouled off 
several pitches. On the ninth pitch of his at-bat, Williams drove 
a two-run homer to left-center field. When Ashby was mercifully lifted 
in the third inning, he had thrown 66 pitches. When Brown was taken 
out after six and a third innings, he had thrown 106 pitches. Once 
a starter has left early, the Padres have been forced to use their 
weak middle relievers, who have come in only to make matters worse. 
By the time the eighth or ninth inning rolls around, the Yankees have 
built such gaudy leads that there has been no score for Hoffman to 
keep tight, much less something to close. More than statistics alone, 
Hoffman's absence indicates just how dominant the Yankees have been 
offensively. When the Padres have been able to gather some runs, the 
Yankees have countered by dwarfing their efforts with innings resembling 
football scores in the first two games of the series. ``You don't 
mind giving up a run here or there,'' Bochy said, but big innings 
are a problem. ``They have hurt us the last two games,'' he said. 
``It sure is hard to overcome, especially against a team like New 
York.'' But overcome, they must. If the Padres cannot find an answer 
to the dominating Yankees or a cure for what ails them, history will 
wipe them away like crumbs on a table. They will become just another 
team that could not come back from a 2-0 deficit. Of the 44 previous 
teams that have led, 2-0, 33 have gone on to win the World Series. 
``We are glad it is a best-of-seven,'' Bochy said. ``Down 0-2 is not 
the situation we were hoping for, but, hey, it has been overcome before.'' 
There are plenty of Yankees who realize this; 1996 was not that long 
ago. And there are plenty of Padres who remember it, too. Jim Leyritz, 
for one. He was the Yankee who stuck out his bat and bridged the gap 
over the impossible for his team. Leyritz is well remembered for the 
Game 4 home run he hit off Atlanta's Mark Wohlers in the 1996 World 
Series, a three-run, game-tying morale-booster for the Yankees. After 
taking Game 3 and coming back to win Game 4, nothing seemed unreachable 
for the Yankees. With the vision of 1996 as a firm reminder, the Yankees 
understand that a 2-0 lead provides no cause for celebration. ``No 
question about it,'' Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. ``Believe me, 
we don't take anything for granted. The Padres are a good team. They 
had a 5-2 lead on us in Game 1. They have come through some tough 
series against Houston and Atlanta, so you know how good they are.'' 
They were not good enough to decode Hernandez's stuff in Game 2. In 
the afterglow of his performance, he was puffing on a cigar, but few 
Yankees were willing to puff out their chests and proclaim the series 
over. ``Going to the West Coast at 2-0, you can't be in a better position,'' 
right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``But being at home is a big advantage. 
Things can change in a hurry.''
