One of those problems involves a sexual harassment lawsuit brought 
by Paula Corbin Jones. A Federal judge in Arkansas released previously 
sealed documents from the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against 
President Clinton by Ms. Jones. The move comes one day before a court's 
expected to hear arguments about reopening the Jones' lawsuit which 
was dismissed in April. VOA's Chalis McDonough reports, the documents 
have been released a day after Mr. Clinton rejected a $2 million settlement 
proposal by lawyers for Ms. Jones. Once again, court documents relating 
to President Clinton have been made public via the Internet. Judge 
Susan Weber Wright has put hundreds of pages of previously secret 
documents from the Paula Jones' lawsuit onto her Federal court's worldwide 
website. The release does not include a transcript of Mr. Clinton's 
deposition in the case. Independent counsel Kenneth Starr has accused 
the president of perjuring himself in that sworn testimony. The massive 
release comes the day before lawyers for Ms. Jones head to a Federal 
Appeals Court to ask to have her suit reinstated. Judge Wright dismissed 
the suit in April, saying Ms. Jones could not prove she was harmed 
by the president's alleged actions. The documents made public include 
a motion by former White House intern Monica Lewinsky to quash a subpoena 
requiring her to testify in the case. They also include the president's 
written answers deposed by Ms. Jones' lawyers. In those answers, he 
denies having sexual relations since 1986 with any woman who worked 
for the Federal government or the State of Arkansas. Mr. Clinton has 
since admitted to having a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a Federal 
employee. But he says he thought he was testifying truly in the Jones' 
case because he did not think their conduct qualified as sexual relations 
under the definition used by that court. The Jones' lawyers asked 
him to name every Federal or State employee with whom he had or sought 
to have sexual relations in all of his more than 20 years in elected 
office. But the judge narrowed that time period to one beginning in 
1986, five years before his alleged encounter with Ms. Jones in a 
Little Rock hotel room. The president's answer to that question was 
none. On Sunday, Mr. Clinton rejected a settlement proposal from Ms. 
Jones. She had offered to drop the lawsuit in exchange for $2 million, 
$1 million from Mr. Clinton and $1 million from New York real estate 
developer Abe Hirschfeld. Mr. Hirschfeld had volunteered his own money 
to settle the case which he calls an embarrassing spectacle. Ms. Jones, 
earlier last week, rejected the president's offer to settle for $500,000, 
not including any money from the New York millionaire. More documents 
from the Jones' case are scheduled for release in one week. Chalis
