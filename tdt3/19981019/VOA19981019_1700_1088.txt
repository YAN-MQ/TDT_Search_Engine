Time now for sports. Joining us here in the studio, Jim Stevenson, 
and for those of us who are worried about whether Mike Tyson will 
be able to support himself, our worries are over. I guess so, if you 
can look at it that way. Former world heavyweight boxing champion 
Mike Tyson has been given the go ahead to continue his boxing career 
by the Nevada Athletic Commission. Tyson went before the five member 
panel on Monday, one month after he was told to undergo a psychological 
evaluation to help the Commission reach its decision. The vote was 
four to one in favor or restoring Tyson's license, allowing him to 
resume his boxing career. But, the decision came with a warning from 
Chairman Elias Ganam. I want to warn you, from my view, this will 
indeed be your last chance. Mike, you must take responsibility for 
yourself and act like the champion you once were. You will either 
conduct yourself in accordance with our rules and regulations or you 
will probably never fight again in Nevada. Doctors had said Tyson 
was depressed but unlikely to snap in the ring again as he did when 
he bit Evander Holyfield on the ears during their championship bout 
15 months ago. That incident led to Tyson being banned from the sport. 
Another world heavyweight champion, Mohammed Ali, testified in Tyson's 
behalf, saying that despite all of his problems he should be allowed 
another chance. Tyson himself told the panel not to torture him any 
longer, that he made a mistake and is just a human being trying to 
live his life. Now with his license back, Tyson could return to the 
ring as early as December.
