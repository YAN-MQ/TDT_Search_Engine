In Las Vegas today, the Nevada athletic commission gave Mike Tyson 
another chance. He has been out of boxing since he bit Evander Holyfield 
last year. Today, the commission granted Tyson's request to return. 
The real winner may be the business of boxing itself. ABC's John Frankel 
is in Las Vegas. Mike Tyson said today he could not afford to lose 
his fight. My life is on the line. My freedom is on the line. My professional 
career is on the line. You don't know how sorry I am Also in Tyson's 
corner, his new promoter, magic Johnson. The three-hour session included 
testimony from the medical team that evaluated Tyson's mental state. 
They recommended he be allowed to resume boxing. We believe Mr. Tyson 
is better prepared to handle the stresses of boxing than he is to 
be put in a new situation. I make a motion that we grant Mr. Tyson's 
petition for reinstatement. Some believe Al pressure motivated the 
commission to reissue the license. The moral authority was less important 
than the money Tyson can generate. He is what generates the huge purses. 
He generates the huge audiences. The second battle was the largest 
grossing fight in history. In addition to nearly $9 million in nongambling 
revenues for Las Vegas, it was seen on pay per view in a record 2 
million homes. There has never been a product for lack of a better 
word, on pay per view like Mike Tyson. In spite of or because of his 
life, he is a money-making machine. It is now up to magic Johnson 
to steer him through the next phase of his career.
