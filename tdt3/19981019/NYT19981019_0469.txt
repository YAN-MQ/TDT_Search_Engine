Talk about poor timing. The San Diego Padres get to the World Series 
twice in their 30-year history, and they play the 1984 Detroit Tigers 
and the 1998 New York Yankees. ``If you're saying the two times we've 
gone, we've played the best teams in baseball, you're right,'' Tony 
Gwynn said Monday. ``There's nothing you can do about that. You're 
sure not going to give it back, that's for sure.'' But couldn't the 
Padres have won the National League pennant in a year in which the 
American League winner didn't have one of the best seasons in history? 
``That's the thing about getting to the World Series,'' Gwynn, the 
Padres' elder statesman, said. ``You can't pick. When it's time to 
go, it's time to go. You have to play the cards that are dealt.'' 
Heading into Tuesday night's third game of this World Series, the 
cards are definitely stacked against the Padres. They are down, two 
games to none, and are in danger of disappearing even faster than 
their 1984 ancestors. That year's World Series lasted five games. 
The Tigers won the first game in San Diego, the Padres won the second, 
and then the Tigers went home and won all three games there. End of 
Series. End of Padres. ``That was a team that jumped out to some unbelievable 
record and never looked back,'' said Greg Booker, a relief pitcher 
for the '84 Padres and the bullpen coach for these Padres. ``It was 
their year. You're talking about playing a whole year with the confidence 
that that team did, just like this team has here, winning a hundred-some 
games. There are a lot of similarities.'' The Tigers won 35 of their 
first 40 games, a start that not even the Yankees (31-9) matched in 
this, their record-breaking year. The Tigers finished with a 104-58 
record (the Yankees 114-48), then swept a three-game league championship 
series from Kansas City before pummeling the Padres. The similarities 
Booker referred to have continued in the World Series. Just as the 
Yankees had their way with Andy Ashby, the starting pitcher in Game 
2, the Tigers repeatedly drove the Padres' starting pitcher from the 
game early. In five of the Padres' seven World Series games, their 
starting pitcher has not made it through three innings. Ashby went 
out after two and two-thirds, allowing seven runs, though only four 
earned. In 1984, Mark Thurmond, the Game 1 starter, pitched five innings, 
but then Ed Whitson got only two outs in the second game, and he was 
followed by Tim Lollar with one and two-thirds innings pitched; Eric 
Show, who went two and two-thirds, and Thurmond, who got only one 
out. The 1984 starters combined for a 13.94 ERA, allowing 16 earned 
runs in 101/3 innings. ``I know that killed us in '84,'' said Bruce 
Bochy, the Padres' manager, who was their backup catcher then. ``But 
I think the difference is, our starters were a little intimidated 
by Detroit. Our guys now aren't.'' As bizarre as it might seem, the 
game the Padres won in 1984 was the one Whitson started. The Padres, 
down by 3-0, struck back with five runs, while Andy Hawkins and Craig 
Lefferts held the Tigers scoreless the rest of the game. Sparky Anderson 
managed those Tigers, and Monday he was asked on the telephone to 
compare his team and these Yankees. He never quite got around to it. 
He spent the entire conversation raving about the Yankees. He didn't 
talk about his catcher Lance Parrish or his right fielder Kirk Gibson 
or his center fielder Chet Lemon or his middle infield combination 
of Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell. He didn't compare his closer, Willie 
(later Guillermo) Hernandez, to Mariano Rivera, or his starting pitching 
of Jack Morris, Dan Petry and Milt Wilcox to the Yankees' strong starting 
corps. He just kept raving about the Yankees. Gwynn, who also played 
in the 1984 World Series, said he really didn't want to talk about 
1984 either; in fact, he said, ``I'm tired of talking.'' But he would 
not be Tony Gwynn if he stopped talking, so he just kept talking. 
He was raving about Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter, the first two 
batters in the Yankees' lineup, and he was asked to compare them to 
Whitaker and Trammell, Nos. 1 and 2 in Anderson's batting order. ``They 
were different types of hitters,'' said Gwynn, the man who was tired 
of talking. ``Knoblauch is the feisty guy who can stand there, take 
pitches, foul pitches off, get hit by pitches, and he can swing the 
bat. He's very unusual. He's a good hitter first. ``Jeter can do everything. 
He's polished. He can inside-out balls. He can turn on balls, drive 
them. In today's game, he's your typical 2-hitter. He does everything 
well. He can play hit-and-run, has a good eye, has good bat control. 
He hits with some power, drives in runs. These two guys are very unusual 
because they are really polished at what they do.'' Whitaker and Trammell, 
Gwynn said, were two great players, but, he said, ``They were two 
different types of players.'' He added: ``Neither one of them really 
stole a lot of bases. Neither one of them was really great at bat 
control. They did their own thing their own way.'' Tim Flannery, the 
Padres' third-base coach, was a utility infielder for the '84 Padres 
and played against Whitaker and Trammell and the rest of the Tigers. 
Asked what he recalled about the Tigers, he said: ``I can't remember. 
Bad things I erase out my mind.'' That means Flannery may soon have 
to erase his other World Series experience, too.
