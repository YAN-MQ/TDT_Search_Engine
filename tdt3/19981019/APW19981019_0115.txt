in northern Egypt that killed about 52 people. At least 100 people 
were injured when a train derailed in Kafr el-Dawar, about 30 kilometers 
(18.6 miles) southeast of Alexandria Sunday afternoon, said Nabih 
Yousef Shaltout, the medical director in the province of Buheira. 
Five mangled bodies were found beneath the last three carriages to 
be hoisted by a mobile crane. With the 47 fatalities reported by Shaltout 
earlier, the death toll reached 52, though the number has not been 
officially confirmed. Residents of Kafr el-Dawar who helped take the 
casualties to hospitals said many more had died. Residents also accused

Mohammed Lotfi. ``Everyone you see working here is a local man. We

but they called us crazy.'' Shaltout said most of the dead were bystanders 
in the town, while most of the injured were passengers. As the last 
body was recovered, a resident of the village named Hamdi Kamel said 
``all there was was chunks of flesh.'' The train, 8th graf pvs
