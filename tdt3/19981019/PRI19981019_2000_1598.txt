Cheap imports are putting U.S. jobs at risk. I'm Liz George at the 
business desk in New York. Imports flooding into the U.S. from failing 
economies around the world may force some companies to make large 
scale job cuts in order to compete. The steel industry, which is traditionally 
the first sector to sound the alarm bells over surging imports, has 
already seen a thousand workers laid off according to its main union. 
William Klinefeld of the United Steelworkers of America believes the 
situation will get worse, possibly prompting a backlash in Congress. 
The global crisis was seen originally for the United States anyway, 
as an export crisis. We were talking about the fact that if we didn't 
put the IMF funding into Korea, into Indonesia and Thailand and Russia 
to some extent, that what we would see a decrease in their ability 
to buy our goods. However, what we're seeing now is, because of the 
way in which the IMF had a very cookie-cutter approach to this problem, 
they told these countries that the way to get out of your problem 
and to repay the loans is to export your way out of it. The more we 
see that, the more we're going to see a negative reaction by American 
workers and their representatives in Congress. And other industries 
are feeling the pain too. The latest figures from the textile workers 
union Unite show that clothing imports from Mexico and the Caribbean 
have rocketed. Meanwhile, poultry producers have been looking to expand 
their export market to China and the Black Sea, following the collapse 
of sales in Russia. They've also asked for export credits to help 
restart the Russian market which previously accounted for 40 percent 
of all U.S. chicken sales abroad. And over the past few months, we've 
heard from a raft of U.S. companies which have been hit by falling 
trade in the far east, but the reverse. The Japanese car maker Nissan 
has issued a profits warning. It says it's likely to report a $286 
million half year loss, partly due to poor sales in America. Well, 
that's our look at business around the world today. I'm Liz George 
in New York.
