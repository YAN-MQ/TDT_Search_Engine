The cost of tackling ''mad cow'' disease might reach 4.6 billion pounds 
(dlrs 7.8 billion) by 2002, a British government official said Monday. 
But about 45 percent of that sum will be reimbursed by the European 
community, said Jeffrey Rooker, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Fisheries and Food, in a written reply to a question from the House 
of Commons. The cost is estimated from 1996 when the European Union 
banned British beef exports. The ban came after Britain announced 
a possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, 
and the fatal, brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The disease 
has killed 27 people in Britain since 1995. Hundreds of thousands 
of cattle have been slaughtered and their carcasses destroyed since 
March 1996 as part of the government's attempt to eradicate the disease. 
But Britain has been actively lobbying the European Union to ease 
its ban on British beef exports by the end of the year.
