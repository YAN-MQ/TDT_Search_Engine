Another deadly explosion, this one in Colombia. At least 45 people 
were killed in an oil pipeline blast and more than 70 others were 
injured. Officials in the northwest of the country say the blast and 
fire occurred early yesterday morning while townspeople were asleep. 
The pipeline exploded in a rural area near the town of Segovia. The 
cause of the explosion has not been determined but police say they 
believe it was the work of leftist rebels. The Osensa pipeline is 
a regular target of Colombia's second largest insurgent group, the 
National Liberation Army.
