Signing bonuses. Flexible scheduling. Scholarship offers and internships. 
Such recruiting tools are common in these days of low unemployment, 
but not just for information technology experts or investment bankers. 
They are some of the ways American restaurants are trying to take 
a bite out of a major industry problem _ a shortage of workers. ``People 
would like to have these jobs filled, but the workers aren't available,'' 
said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Georgia State University Economic 
Forecasting Center. ``It's a top-of-the-list issue for us and the 
food service industry in general,'' said Donald Perry, spokesman for 
the Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A chain, whose 2-week-old restaurant in 
suburban Loganville is among 85 locations opening this year. ``Because 
of the low unemployment and changes in society, the numbers are just 
not out there.'' Chick-fil-A and other expanding restaurant groups 
have an appetite for more restaurants, but face little demand for 
the jobs to staff them. AFC Enterprises, an Atlanta-based group of 
fast-food chicken and coffee-and-bagel restaurants, is adding 400 
locations worldwide this year. Each new restaurant requires 20 to 
25 new hires. ``It's a factor,'' said Lee Channell, vice president 
for people services at AFC. ``Like any other restaurant company, we're 
challenged (to find employees).'' Edgar Brush, a 16-year veteran of 
the restaurant business who operates the new Chick-fil-A in Loganville, 
said hiring ``has changed drastically.'' Besides low unemployment 
rates _ 3 percent or lower in much of metropolitan Atlanta _ he finds 
that many children of baby boomers are unwilling to accept the fast-paced 
work. ``So many have been raised to have everything handed to them,'' 
said Brush, who came to Loganville from a downtown Atlanta restaurant 
where turnover was a major problem. ``You've got to work harder to 
find them, and you've got to work harder to keep them.'' Brush used 
paid advertising and called church youth ministries to help find the 
66 employees needed to start operations at his restaurant about 50 
miles (90 kms) northeast of Atlanta. He said Loganville is a working-family 
town, so it wasn't as difficult to find willing workers. When Mike 
Grisham, managing partner of Maggiano's Little Italy, began hiring 
last year for the new restaurant in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood, 
he advertised in college newspapers and recruited through school parent-teacher 
organizations. Restaurateurs are also using job fairs and employment 
agencies to find workers. AFC has focused on community and school 
involvement and has been active in the Hospitality Business Alliance. 
That's a partnership of the National Restaurant Association and the 
American Hotel and Motel Association that works with schools to interest 
students in their businesses and to provide education, mentoring and 
internships. AFC's Channell said the effort is part of the restaurant 
industry's goal ``to establish ourselves as a place to have a long-term 
career, where you can move very rapidly.'' For the short term, restaurants 
are spending more money on advertising, and wages have been bumped 
above the dlrs 5.15-an-hour minimum wage for most entry-level jobs. 
In some affluent suburbs, dlrs 7-an-hour starting wages for fast-food 
restaurants are common and some restaurants have offered small ``signing 
bonuses'' of dlrs 50 or dlrs 100 to new employees. Among Chick-fil-A's 
inducements are the 1,000 scholarships of dlrs 1,000 each it gives 
out annually and the guarantee of Sundays off. By tradition, all the 
chain's restaurants are closed on Sunday. Grisham, who moved to Atlanta 
from the Chicago restaurant business, said more than money and flexible 
scheduling is needed to keep employees. He offers perquisites such 
as free food at the restaurant, cultivates the work force as ``one 
big family'' with picnics and other outings, and tries to make sure 
good performance is rewarded. Last year's top employee was given a 
two-week trip to Europe.
