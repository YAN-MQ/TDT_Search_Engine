When we come back, science, a step towards a cure for multiple sclerosis. 
Could one virus unleash all the symptoms? Female: Home Depot is about 
building. So, today we're helping people build a playground. Everybody's 
just kind of pitching in and doing what's got to be done to get it 
done. When I first started working out here, it was just a plot of 
land... with weeds growing through it. It's going to be pretty, clean 
and no graffiti. The children are the experts. They drew us pictures 
with crayons and clay sculpture models. 'cause the kids don't have 
an outdoor place really to go to other than the streets. It's a tough 
neighborhood. There's a lot of crime... there's a lot of violence. 
They were doing drugs and they did drive-BYs. I look out here and 
see all these people working together, it makes me feel really good. 
It'll show members of the community that there are other people besides 
themselves that care about what happens around here. We have jungle 
gyms. We have swings, slides... things that they can Hang from and 
swing across. This project is home Depot. This is what we're all about. 
We really care about the community, we care about the kids. We believe 
in giving back what the community has given to us. Life's an adventure! 
Because you're over 50 and still exploring! So take the centrum made 
just for you. Centrum silver. With age-essential nutrients... specially 
adjusted to keep pace with your changing nutritional needs. Centrum
