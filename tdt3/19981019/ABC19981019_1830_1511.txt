Finally this evening, the way they live. We are going to make several 
stops this week in other places where we are quite convinced that 
Americans will learn something about living a better life. The Greek 
island of crete has always been identified with healing and regeneration. 
And once again in an ancient culture, there may be lessons for modern 
life. ABC's Sheila MacVicar paid a visit. On the Greek island of crete, 
where all the trees grow in endless rows and the cicadas speak of 
summer heat, the people live long, very long. "My mother was 112 when 
she died," he says, "I'm planning to be 120." There is no fountain 
of youth here and low stress isn't the only answer. For 30 years, 
some researchers have said that what they eat gives the people of 
crete the lowest rate of heart disease in the western world. Ten times 
lower than the rate in the United States. "Olive oil is good for the 
heart he says, "it's good for the heart." Olive oil with everything, 
especially with the pound of more of fresh fruit and vegetables people 
here eat every day. With the fish they favor over meat, all washed 
down with a little wine. This isn't low fat, but new research shows 
it may be the healthiest way to eat. A study by French doctors has 
confirmed what earlier research suggests. They put hundreds of French 
heart patients on a diet based on that of the people of crete, and 
the impact of their longevity and health was remarkable. They had 
almost complete -- 300 of Dr. renaud's patients followed the low-fat 
diet recommended by the American heart association. And 300 others 
ate like the people of crete. Within two months there was a difference. 
And within two years, the patients on the cretan diet had a 75% lower 
incidence of heart attack and death. Now, researchers in the U.S. 
want to find out if eating like the people of crete will cut the rate 
of heart disease in America, too. But even if the diet of crete is 
preventative medicine, Americans will still have to decide if they 
will take it. Sheila MacVicar, ABC News, crete.
