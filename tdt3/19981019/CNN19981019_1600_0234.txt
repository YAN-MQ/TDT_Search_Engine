The first day of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft 
has wrapped up in Washington. Government lawyers showed jurors videotaped 
excerpts from pretrial interviews with Microsoft chairman and founder 
Bill Gates as part of their opening statements. They argued he was 
behind a controversial meeting with rival Netscape to divide the market 
for Internet software. Microsoft is expected to present its opening 
statements tomorrow. Don Knapp looks at who's involved. The best-known 
face in the government's antitrust case against microsoft won't likely 
appear inside the Washington, D.C., courtroom. But Bill Gates hasn't 
shied away from defending his company from government scrutiny. These 
operating systems are based on ideas, and no company owns the factory 
for ideas. Not as nearly well known as Gates, Microsoft's number two 
man steve balmer. He took the helm in July. Net worth -- $12 billion. 
On the government's side, Joel Klein heads the justice department's 
antitrust division and has been leading the charge against Microsoft 
from the beginning. David boies has been called the government's hired 
gun and no stranger to antitrust cases. Ironically, he was a defense 
attorney for IBM in the government's first big antitrust case against 
a computer giant. He won it for IBM. While eight of Microsoft's own 
executives top the company's witness list, some of the biggest names 
in American technology will take the stand for the government. Representatives 
from America online Intel, intuit, IBM, apple and Boeing will appear, 
as will the CEO of Netscape, the Internet browser company that's lost 
much of its market share to Microsoft's Internet explorer. James barksdale 
may have given a preview of his testimony earlier this year on Capitol 
Hill. How many people here have use a PC without Microsoft operating 
system? Gentlemen, that's a monopoly. All the players in the Microsoft 
case are playing for keeps. And the stakes are huge. Whoever wins 
will may well define the future of the computer industry. Don Knapp, 
CNN, San Francisco.
