President Clinton is back at the Mid East summit trying to win an 
agreement in the wake of an Arab grenade attack in Israel. Mr. Clinton 
says each side must consider the consequences of failure. Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
say they will intensify efforts to reach an agreement. But Israel 
has suspended talks on all subjects except improving security, its 
main demand, before giving up 13 percent more of the West Bank.
