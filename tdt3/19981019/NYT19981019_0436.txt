C. David Marsden, a British neurologist who was one of the world's 
leading authorities on movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, 
died on Sept. 29 at his American residence in Columbia, Md. A resident 
of Ash, in Kent, England, he was 60 and had just begun a one-year 
sabbatical, his first, at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, 
Md. The cause of death was a heart attack, said Robin Elliott, executive 
director of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation in New York; Marsden 
was a member of its research advisory board. Marsden was a professor 
of neurology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery 
in London and until recently, dean of the Institute of Neurology in 
London. A prolific writer, he took credit for publishing more than 
1,000 papers, including 800 original papers and classic texts that 
underpin present concepts of movement disorders. He achieved global 
recognition with research on the functions and pharmacology of basal 
ganglia and motor physiology. His work led to his 1972 appointment 
as the first Professor of Neurology at King's College Hospital Medical 
School in London. At 34, he was the youngest neurologist to hold a 
chair in that specialty. He filled the post until 1987, when he was 
named professor and head of the University of London's Department 
of Clinical Neurology at Queen Square. He was elected Dean of the 
Institute of Neurology at the University of London in 1995. He and 
a frequent collaborator, Dr. Stanley Fahn of Columbia Presbyterian 
Medical Center in New York, were acknowledged leaders of research 
into the movement disorders. They founded the Movement Disorder Society, 
of which Marsden was the first president, and edited its journal together. 
Charles David Marsden's entry in the British ``Who's Who'' lists ``the 
human brain'' as his recreation. Born in 1938, he studied at Cheltenham 
College, after which he earned his medical and science degrees at 
St. Thomas Hospital Medical School at the University of London. Marsden, 
who was married twice, is survived by his companion, Dr. Claudia Kawas, 
a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Other 
survivors include a son and three daughters from his first marriage 
to Jill Slaney Bullock, a resident of Dorset: Andrew of Bristol, Anna 
of Reading, Abigail of Woking, and Amy Marsden, also of Woking, all 
in England; and three daughters from his marriage to Jennifer Sandom, 
a resident of New Ash Green, Kent, from whom he was separated: Lucy, 
14, Alice, 9, and Jessica Marsden, 6, all of New Ash Green; a brother, 
John, of Ashover, England; and two grandsons.
