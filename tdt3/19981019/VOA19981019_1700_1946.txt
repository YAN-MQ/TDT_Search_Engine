The former military chief of Angola's UNITA rebel movement has died 
in a hospital in South Africa and UNITA has alleged he was poisoned. 
A spokeswoman at a Pretoria hospital says 42 year old Arlindo Chenda 
Pena died Monday, two days after being admitted with a bad case of 
malaria. But the UNITA movement released a statement saying the general 
was poisoned by the Angolan government and a splinter UNITA group. 
The Angolan government denies the charge.
