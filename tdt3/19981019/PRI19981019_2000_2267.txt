Better grab a parka or better make it two, not to mention an oxygen 
mask, because we're headed to new heights for today's geography quiz. 
In fact we're going 29,000 feet above sea level. That's where you'll 
find the peak of our mystery destination. The Chinese call the place. 
That's a reverent word for those of you who are not fluent in Nepalese. 
It means goddess mother of the world. In English, the mountain goes 
by the name of the British surveyor general of India, from 1830 to 
1843. Before that it was simply known to westerners as peak 15. Local 
guides or Sherpas claim that there is a creature that lives on peak 
15, a beast known as the yetti. So, is there really a snow man in 
this abominable place? Breathe slowly. We'll bring you the answer 
in just a few minutes.
