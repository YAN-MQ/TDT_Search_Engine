The Chilean government has asked people to remain calm and not reopen 
old political wounds in response to the arrest in London of former 
dictator Augusto Pinochet. Vice President Raul Troncoso issued a statement 
on Monday after a meeting with the cabinet in which he said that Pinochet 
is protected by diplomatic immunity. But Britain says diplomatic immunity 
is reserved for accredited diplomats or foreign government officials 
on official visits, which doesn't cover Pinochet, who is recovering 
from back surgery on London. Monday's statement in Santiago was the 
first from the Chilean Government since Pinochet's arrest on Friday 
in London. The 82-year-old former dictator said in a statement issued 
through his lawyers on Monday that he would fight extradition to Spain. 
In Spain on Monday, Judge Baltasar Garzon, widened the basis of his 
original detention request to include charges of genocide, torture 
and murder in the disappearance of 94 people, mostly Chileans. The 
original arrest warrant was for questioning about an unspecified number 
of Spaniards who were killed or vanished in the first decade after 
Pinochet seized power in 1973. Garzon is probing Pinochet's alleged 
role in Operation Condor in which juntas in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay 
and elsewhere cooperated to snuff out dissent in each other's countries 
in the 1970s and 1980s. Troncoso is acting president while Chilean 
President Eduardo Frei is in Europe. Frei has also protested Pinochet's 
arrest. ``After the preventive arrest of Senator Pinochet in a London 
clinic, a climate of concern has been created as we have noted today,'' 
Troncoso said. ``People must remain calm.'' He added that Pinochet's 
arrest ``should not alter our coexistence or revive conflicts that 
Chileans have learned to overcome,'' an apparent reference to the 
strong emotions that Pinochet still provokes in Chile. Thousands took 
to the streets of Santiago on Sunday to alternatively protest Pinochet's 
arrest, or to show their support of it. The rallies were mostly peaceful, 
although riot police used tear gas and water canons on some protesters 
trying to break through police lines into the British embassy on Sunday 
evening. No arrests or injuries were reported. Pinochet took power 
in power in 1973 with a coup. He left the government in 1990 although 
he retained the post of Commander in Chief of the Army until his retirement 
in March. According to the constitution that he changed, he is a senator 
for life. A Chilean government report after he left office said 4,299 
political opponents were killed or vanished during his rule.
