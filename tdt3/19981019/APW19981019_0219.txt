A former fund manager at Morgan Grenfell has been charged with conspiracy 
to defraud as part of a scandal that cost the investment bank millions, 
the Serious Fraud Office said Monday. Peter Young was released on 
conditional bail to appear back in the City of London magistrates 
court on Nov. 10. He was charged under the Financial Services Act 
along with three others, Stewart Armer, Erik Langaker and Jan Helge 
Johnsen. Court papers did not provide any additional information about 
the other three men, and no one from Morgan Grenfell could be reached 
for comment. Young got into trouble by filling three big investment 
funds with stocks that were of uncertain value because they were not 
traded on any exchange. Morgan Grenfell vastly overestimated the value 
of the funds, and a crisis erupted when investors learned about the 
irregularities and began panic-selling in September 1996. Trading 
in the funds was halted for three days and resumed only after Morgan 
Grenfell's parent company, Germany's Deutsche Bank, paid 180 million 
pounds (dlrs 293 million) to buy some of the questionable stocks and 
bring the funds into compliance with London regulations. Morgan Grenfell 
eventually was fined a record 2 million pounds (dlrs 3.25 million) 
and had to repay 200 million pounds (dlrs 325 million) to investors.
