The death toll from a massive gas pipeline fire has risen to 500 in 
Nigeria and health officials there fear the number will grow as badly 
burned people are dying of their wounds. Nigeria's president is traveling 
to the devastated areas, some 300 kilometers southeast of Lagos. Officials 
say they're still trying to determine the cause of Sunday's blaze 
near Warri. Many of the victims were trying to collect gas from the 
pipeline when an undetermined fire source set it ablaze. Nigerian 
officials suspect sabotage.
