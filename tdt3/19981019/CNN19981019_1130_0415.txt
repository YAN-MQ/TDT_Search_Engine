The U.N. refugee agency has canceled two relief convoys into Kosovo 
and has sent a team to investigate reports that Serb tanks were rumbling 
toward a Camp of ethnic Albanian refugees. A surge of violence has 
struck the southern Yugoslav province, despite nAto's threat to launch 
air strikes, unless Serb police are pulled out. 0% of Kosovo's 2 million 
inhabitants are ethnic Albanians, and most want independence from 
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. Hundreds of people have been 
killed since February in President Slobodan milosevic's crackdown 
on the separatists. Hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes 
to escape the violence.
