Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell has joined a cast of global celebrities 
tapped by the United Nations to put the spotlight on global issues. 
Halliwell, 26, a.k.a. Ginger Spice, has been appointed a goodwill 
ambassador for the U.N. Population Fund in Britain to promote healthier 
choices about reproduction and greater awareness of reproductive rights. 
``She will be a great ambassador for young people,'' Alex Marshall, 
the fund's deputy director for information, said Monday. Halliwell 
quit the all-girl British pop group on May 31, citing ``differences 
between us.'' Last week, the British media reported that she had signed 
a 2 million pound (dlrs 3.4 million) deal with Chrysalis records. 
Halliwell will be working in Britain with Marie Stopes International 
and Population Concern, voluntary organizations which promote reproductive 
health, especially among women, Marshall said. Both groups are part 
of the U.N. Population Fund's ``Face To Face Campaign,'' which is 
using voluntary organizations to promote awareness of population issues 
across Europe. Two of the remaining Spice Girls _ Scary Spice Melanie 
Brown and Posh Spice Victoria Adams _ became pregnant this year by 
their boyfriends. Brown has since married. Asked why Halliwell was 
chosen to be a goodwill ambassador in Britain, Marshall said: ``She 
almost chose herself. She's interested in the issue. She got together 
with Marie Stopes International.'' She is scheduled to appear at a 
press conference at the United Nations Tuesday with officials from 
the fund to discuss her new role. Famed for her ginger-colored hair 
and tight-fitting short dresses, the pop star has gone through a transformation 
since she split with the Spice Girls. She is now blonde and more likely 
to be spotted in a demure suit. Halliwell has also visited inmates 
at London's Holloway prison and students at a London school to highlight 
cancer awareness. And she auctioned many of her most famous Spice 
Girls costumes which raised almost 145,000 pounds (dlrs 242,000) for 
a children's cancer charity. Halliwell became concerned about cancer 
when, at age 18, she discovered a lump in her breast that turned out 
to be benign. The former Spice Girl joins some of the world's biggest 
names, past and present, in promoting U.N. activities. Over the years, 
the U.N. Children's Fund recruited Danny Kaye, Roger Moore, Liv Ullman 
and Audrey Hepburn, to serve as ``goodwill ambassadors'' and money 
raisers. Actor Danny Glover and South African writer Nadine Gordimer 
became the first goodwill ambassadors for the U.N. Development Program 
earlier this year. The United Nations has also recruited celebrities 
to be ``Messengers of Peace,'' including Muhammad Ali, Luciano Pavarotti 
and Michael Douglas. Elton John accepted the honor but last week indefinitely 
postponed taking on the duty. Halliwell became a millionaire with 
the Spice Girls, whose motto ``Girl power!'' drew millions of fans 
worldwide. The group has continued to perform with four members.
