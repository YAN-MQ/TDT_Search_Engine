So much has changed at the gasoline pump it's hard to keep up. It's 
not just the adjoining convenience stores and ATMs, the credit card 
inserts and pump-your-own, it's also the high-tech, digital readouts 
of what you're paying for how much you're getting. But that could 
add up to a "fleecing of America." Here's NBC's George Lewis. You 
go to the gas pump to fill 'ER up. You figure you're getting exactly 
what you're paying for. After all, those pumps are inspected by state 
and local authorities, so they must be accurate. Right? Not always. 
Welcome to the digital age, where law enforcement officials say altered 
computer chips inside some gas pumps are part of a high-tech "fleecing 
of america." The chips give phony readings at the pump, so customers 
wind up with 7% to 25% less gas than they're paying for. And the chips 
can be programmed to fail inspectors. Officials say even when drivers 
complained, it was hard to find a problem. We would send inspectors 
out from the county, from the state, and they would check it out. 
And they said, "there's nothing wrong here." But the complaints kept 
coming, so authorities took a closer look. The inspectors have a standard 
test. Fill up a calibrated container to see if the gas pump is accurate 
at five gallons and again at ten gallons. Authorities say the chips 
were programmed to pump exactly five and ten gallons, but with any 
other amount the pumps would cheat the customers. Here's undercover 
video shot by county inspectors. Between zero and four gallons, the 
numbers run faster than the actual flow of gas. Then, at four gallons, 
the numbers slow down, so that by the time the pump reaches five gallons, 
it's accurate. Then, over five, the numbers speed up again. The same 
process happens at ten gallons. Authorities raided 27 southern California 
gas stations owned by the mepco oil company. The Los Angeles district 
attorney claims customers were "fleeced" out of $1 million. You don't 
think that computer fraud is the crime of the future? it is. The authorities 
say they found 140 altered computer chips in pumps at a dozen stations. 
Mepco's 42-year-old general manager, Mohammed mourad, his 31-year-old 
brother, bragin mourad. Pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of 
grand theft and conspiracy. The prosecution charges that the younger 
mourad programmed the altered chips. Their trial is set for next month. 
Authorities in Los Angeles say this case may be just beginning. They're 
now getting calls from Alaska, Michigan and other states which hope 
to halt what authorities call this "fleecing of America" that could 
amount to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. George Lewis, NBC 
news, Los Angeles.
