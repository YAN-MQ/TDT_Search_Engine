Joan Hickson, a stage, screen and television actress who became an 
international celebrity when she played Miss Marple, Agatha Christie's 
sharp-witted elderly detective, in a BBC television series from 1984 
to 1992, died last weekend at a hospital in Colchester, Essex, said 
her son, Nicholas Butler. She was 92. Though Miss Hickson acted in 
more than 80 movies and had a considerable stage career, it was as 
Miss Marple, a role she took on in her late 70s, that she achieved 
her greatest success and won most renown. She played the part just 
as Christie had written it: as a seemingly fluffy and disorganized 
spinster whose vast understanding of human nature and formidable, 
clear-eyed intelligence helped her solve the mysteries that visited 
her village with uncanny regularity. Miss Hickson took to her late 
television career with relish, saying that she thought Miss Marple 
was a ``splendid'' person, because there was ``nothing you could say 
or do that would shock her.'' Among her legions of fans, drawn from 
the more than 30 countries in which the series appeared, was Queen 
Elizabeth, who awarded Miss Hickson the Order of the British Empire 
in 1987. Born in Kingsthorpe, Northampton, in 1906, Joan Hickson began 
acting as soon as she could, despite disapproval from her relatives. 
``My Aunt Aggie _ she was about 4 feet tall _ drew herself up to her 
full height and said, `What is Joan's destination to be?' which she 
thought was the gutter, you see,'' she once recalled in an interview. 
Her first appearance, in 1927, was with a provincial theater company 
as an aristocrat. Later, she appeared in many West End comedies, often 
taking on the role of a slightly batty aunt or a befuddled middle-aged 
woman, characters with names like Mrs. Pottle, Gladys Rumbelow and 
Mrs. Mould. During World War II, when London was prone to sudden bombing, 
she appeared in the Open Air Theater in Regent's Park. ``We kept one 
eye on the sky to see what was coming over,'' she recalled. ``We used 
to feel the audience were being damned stupid because they sort of 
hurled themselves on the ground.'' After a long stage career, which 
included appearances in Henry James' ``The Tragic Muse'' and Ian Hay's 
``The Gusher,'' she began to appear more and more often in movies, 
including ``The Guinea Pig'' (1948), ``The Card'' (1952), and ``The 
39 Steps'' (1959). Speaking of the scores of films she made, she once 
said: ``I watch these old films in black and white, and suddenly the 
door opens and there I am. The other day I was wearing the most awful 
hat.'' She returned often to the stage. Later in her career, she appeared 
in three of Peter Nichols' plays: ``A Day in the Death of Joe Egg'' 
(1967), ``The Freeway'' and ``Forget-Me-Not Lane'' (1967). She also 
played Mrs. Bradman in the National Theater Company's production of 
Sir Noel Coward's ``Blithe Spirit'' (1976) and won a Tony award as 
best supporting actress for her performance as Delia in Alan Ayckbourn's 
``Bedroom Farce'' (1977). Before she became television's definitive 
Miss Marple (``There were 30 others in the queue for auditions,'' 
she said), she appeared in the slender role of Miss Pryce in a 1946 
West End production of Christie's ``Appointment With Death.'' Christie 
happened to sit in the audience one night, sending Miss Hickson a 
prophetic note afterward that read, ``I hope one day you will play 
my dear Miss Marple.'' ``Retirement is fatal,'' Miss Hickson once 
said, and she continued working long after the Miss Marple series 
ended, recording audio books of Christie mysteries. Her husband, Eric 
Butler, a family doctor, died in 1967. She is survived by a son and 
a daughter.
