Enterprise? Hi, I'm at the repair shop. I need to rent a car. Enterprise 
will arrange to pick you up. This is great. Drive you to our place 
and get you on your way. Pick enterprise: you use it every day. But 
do you really KNOW WHAT's in there? Not everything. no. I never thought 
about it. My medicine cabinet? Well, it pays to take a good look in 
your medicine cabinet. You might be surprised to find... that you 
may have a prescription drug... that could interact with an over-the-counter 
medication, altering the effectiveness or safety... of one or both 
of the drugs. So here are some tips... for you and your medicine cabinet. 
First, read the label for any warnings about drug interactions. Then 
get rid of all out-of-date medicines... and those you don't take anymore. 
Who needs 'em? And if you're one of the millions of people... who 
takes a prescription drug, speak with your doctor... about the pain 
reliever you choose. For people on certain prescriptions, Tylenol 
is the brand of pain reliever... doctors recommend most. So check 
out your medicine cabinet. Any questions? Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist. Tylenol house call is brought to you by extra strength
