She sounds like Celine Dion and that's how her label EMI Records International 
is hyping her. What's more, newly discovered Polish singing sensation 
Edita Gorniak looks, in all her album cover shots, as if she's posing 
for a Victoria's Secret catalog. EMI has shipped her eponymously titled 
debut CD to Nordic radio stations. It'll probably be some time before 
she goes into rotation on American play lists. But Gorniak's previous 
album Dotik, which means touch in Polish, sold a half million copies 
in her homeland. And with numbers like that and new songs like Gone, 
Edita Gorniak may dig herself a groove here in the United States.
