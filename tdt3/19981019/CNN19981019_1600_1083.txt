Coca-Cola says thanks but no thanks to the Yankees. Coca-Cola has 
rejected the asking price of $12 million to continue as the bronx 
bombers' official soft drink. That figure is about five times the 
price of its current 3-year contract. That deal expires after this 
baseball season. But Coke still wants to strike a deal. Nearly three 
million fans flocked to Yankee stadium this season.
