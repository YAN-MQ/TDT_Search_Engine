Rescue teams ended their search for survivors Monday after lifting 
the last car of a train that jumped its tracks and crashed into a 
north Egyptian village, killing at least 47 people. An additional 
100 people, most of them villagers, were injured when the derailed 
in Kafr el-Dawar, about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of the 
port city of Alexandria, at 5:10 p.m. local time (1510 GMT) on Sunday, 
said Nabih Yousef Shaltout, the head of health care in the local province 
of Buheira. Five mangled bodies were found beneath the last three 
carriages to be lifted by a mobile crane. With the 47 fatalities reported 
by Shaltout earlier, the death toll could reach 52, but this was not 
confirmed officially. Residents of Kafr el-Dawar suggested that the 
toll could be higher. Villagers who helped transport the casualties 
to hospitals said they had seen many more bodies. Residents also accused 
the authorities of neglect. ``No one came until 8:15,'' said Khaled 
Mohammed Lotfi. ``Everyone you see working here is a local man. We 
asked them to call the Defense Ministry to bring in soldiers to help, 
but they called us crazy.'' Shaltout said most of the dead were bystanders 
in the town and that most of the injured were passengers on the train. 
As the last body was recovered, a resident of the village named Hamdi 
Kamel said ``all there was was chunks of flesh.'' The train, which 
was traveling south from Alexandria, left the rails when the driver 
changed tracks ``at high speed,'' the Interior Ministry said in a 
statement. A teen-ager who saw the crash, Hany Roushdy, said the train 
was moving very fast. ``It did not seem to able to stop. It shot off 
the tracks and went towards the town square,'' he said. The train 
crashed through a wall beside the railway, hit a war memorial in the 
square and slammed into seven shops, witnesses said. When the train 
hit the buildings, ``it sounded like thunder,'' said Roushdy, 18. 
A businessman in the square, Mustafa Attiya, said he heard girls screaming. 
``I turned around and saw the train shoot across and hit the girls.'' 
The train snared the leg of a fruit vendor. Taxi driver Saeid Saleh 
said the merchant was screaming ``Help me! Help me!'' People did manage 
to free him, but he emerged with blood gushing from his leg, Saleh 
said. A crane was brought in to hoist the locomotive and the first 
two passenger cars, which had overturned. As hundreds of villagers 
tried to break through a cordon of riot police armed with shields 
and bamboo canes, other citizens responded to calls for blood and 
other donations. Residents gave 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of blood 
in the first few hours after the crash, Shaltout said. ``Police asked 
me to buy 45 coffins and shrouds for the dead,'' said Ahmed Mohammed 
Abdallah, a resident of Kafr el-Dawar. Some people tore their clothes 
into bandages to staunch the bleeding of the wounded, Egypt's Middle 
East News Agency reported. But there were angry scenes outside the 
local hospital where police armed with automatic rifles kept relatives 
at bay. ``I just want to ask about my family,'' yelled one man at 
an officer. ``Don't drive me crazy. I have my orders not to let anyone 
in,'' the officer shouted back. A senior railway official, Mahmoud 
Marei, said the driver was speeding because free-riding passengers 
had tampered with the brakes system between the cars, the news agency 
reported. It is not uncommon for people to hitch a ride on the roof 
and between the carriages of such commuter trains. Egyptian railways 
have suffered a series of accidents in the past four years. The most 
serious was in December 1995, when one train crashed into another 
in fog south of Cairo, killing 75 people and injuring 76.
