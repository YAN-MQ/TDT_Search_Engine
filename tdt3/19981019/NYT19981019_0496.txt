Because his nickname is Barney, Liborio Salvatore Bellomo, a reputedly 
powerful New York Mafia leader, got disappointing news on Monday: 
He has to stay in New Jersey. Rejecting his claim that New Jersey 
authorities conducting a mob investigation mixed him up with his cousin, 
who is also known as Barney Bellomo, a federal judge in Trenton, N.J., 
on Monday denied Bellomo's application to be returned immediately 
to his prison cell in Atlanta, where he was serving a 10-year prison 
sentence for racketeering. The ruling cleared the way for Bellomo 
to be brought before a New Jersey grand jury Wednesday with the threat 
that if he refuses to testify, additional time would be tagged on 
to his prison term. Last year, in a federal case in New York unrelated 
to the New Jersey inquiry, Bellomo pleaded guilty to extortion and 
began serving his sentence in the federal penitentiary in Atlanta. 
When he was arrested in 1996 on racketeering charges in New York, 
Bellomo was listed by the FBI as the acting boss of the Genovese crime 
family, the nation's largest and most potent Mafia group. In April, 
the New Jersey attorney general's office transferred Bellomo from 
Atlanta to the Mercer Court Jail in Trenton. State prosecutors said 
they wanted to question Bellomo because a Barney Bellomo had been 
implicated last year in an investigation into a plot to extort $100,000 
from an insurance company in Franklin Lakes, N.J. Bellomo, 41, was 
granted immunity from prosecution concerning his testimony before 
the grand jury. But he refused to testify, contending that he was 
being subjected to vile prison conditions in New Jersey. He argued 
that investigators apparently had confused him with his cousin, Liborio 
Thomas Bellomo, who also goes by the nickname Barney. Federal and 
state authorities say that Liborio T. Bellomo, 39, of Bayside, Queens, 
is a Genovese family associate or worker. Under federal law, if Liborio 
S. Bellomo receives a state jail term for refusing to testify, that 
sentence will not be credited as time served in the 10-year federal 
sentence. ``He will be called before the grand jury on Wednesday,'' 
Robert Codey, the lead prosecutor in the New Jersey case, said Monday 
of Liborio S. Bellomo. ``The next move is up to him.''
