The U.S. dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen Monday as worries 
about the American economy gained the upper hand over those about 
Japan's. Tokyo stock prices rose. The dollar bought 114.28 yen as 
of midafternoon, down 2.16 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also 
below its New York level of 115.25 yen late Friday. The Nikkei Stock 
Average of 225 selected issues gained 286.66 points, or 2.16 percent, 
to finish at 13,567.20 points. On Friday, the key index closed up 
285.17 points, or 2.19 percent. One major reason behind the dollar's 
drop was technical, dealers said. Market players who had been waiting 
to sell the dollar have finally started to do so to guard against 
a further fall. Heightened worries about the future of the American 
economy were another factor, they said. The U.S. Federal Reserve's 
surprise move last week to cut two key short-term interest rates was 
an attempt to encourage spending and consumer confidence, but it had 
the effect of renewing worries about the domestic economy. Expectations 
the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates again helped weigh down 
the dollar. Lower interest rates tend to push a nation's currency 
down. ``Financial market confusion in the U.S. will likely continue 
for some time,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange 
at ABN Amro Bank in Tokyo. ``As long as there is instability, there 
will be dollar-selling pressure.'' Rising Tokyo share prices also 
helped boost the yen and push the dollar lower. The broader Tokyo 
Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section rose 16.24 
points, or 1.61 percent, to 1,022.92 points. The TOPIX closed up 26.57 
points, or 2.71 percent, on Friday. ``It makes you think that, at 
last, Japan-selling is ending and that Japan-buying is beginning,'' 
said Ryohei Muramatsu, foreign exchange manager at Commerzbank in 
Tokyo. Stocks started higher following the passage of Japanese bank 
reform legislation last Friday, which will make available a pool of 
public funds of up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs 524.9 billion) to cash-strapped 
banks. ``The market is also being helped up by the relative stability 
of overseas markets,'' said Naoki Takahashi, manager at Marusan Securities. 
In New York Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 117.40 points 
to 8416.76. The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government 
bond fell to 0.830 percent from Friday's finish of 0.865 percent, 
driving its price up to 108.67 yen from 108.33 yen.
