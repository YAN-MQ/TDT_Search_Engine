In Mexico, some intriguing statements yesterday could lead to new 
efforts to bring southern Mexico's guerrilla war to an end. Leaders 
of the Zapatista rebels seem to be setting conditions for new talks. 
The talks might resume next month. They would be the first in two 
years. VOA's Greg Flakus reports from Mexico City the discussions 
would not involve government representatives. In statements issued 
from their stronghold in the southern state of Chiapas, the Zapatistas 
let it be known that they would be willing to resume peace talks with 
representatives of Mexico's civil society but not with the government 
of President Ernesto Sadilla. The talks would take place in late November 
in the highland city of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas. The 
talks would be carried out with the Commission for Peace and Reconciliation, 
known as COCOPA with which the rebels negotiated an agreement in 1996. 
That accord included an arrangement for autonomy of some Myan Indian 
communities in Chiapas, something the government rejected outright 
at unconstitutional. In one of Sunday's statements, Zapatista leaders 
Subcommander Marcos indicated that talks would be held with civilians 
because the government, in his words, does not want peace. In response 
to the Zapatista's statements, the Mexican government issued a communique 
welcoming the move towards dialogue but rejecting the accusation that 
the government does not want peace. The government communique noted 
that President Sadilla has called for a renewal of talks repeatedly 
over the past two years. The communique also indicated that the government 
would provide whatever assistance is necessary to support the talks 
in San Cristobal. The conflict in Chiapas began on New Years Day 1994 
and resulted in at least 150 deaths before the peace process got underway. 
The Mexican government currently maintains more than 50,000 troops 
around the mountain stronghold of the Zapatistas. Greg Flakus, VOA 
News, Mexico City.
