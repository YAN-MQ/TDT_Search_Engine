America's Lindsey Davenport ended the year as the world's top-ranked 
player in women's tennis. Davenport topped the final rankings, released 
on Monday, despite losing to Martina Inges of Switzerland in the final 
of the season-ending Chase championships in New York, on Sunday. The 
win did allow a second ranking, Use, to gain some ground on Davenport, 
to set up a battle for number-one early next season. That's sports.
