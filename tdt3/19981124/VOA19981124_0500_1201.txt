All-star second baseman Roberto Lamar is now a member of the Cleveland 
Indians. Lamar signed a four-year deal, with the Indians, worth about 
$32 million, after passing a physical exam on Monday. Lamar joins 
his older brother, Sandy, the starting catcher for Cleveland. The 
30-year old Roberto gives the Indians a current, or former, all-star 
player in every starting position. The younger Lamar was a nine-time 
all-star with the Toronto Blue Jays and the Baltimore Orioles. He 
came under criticism back in 1996, with the Orioles, for spitting 
on an umpire while arguing a call.
