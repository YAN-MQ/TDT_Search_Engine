Mutual fund investors had little stomach for making new investments 
while the stock market was jittery and share prices were down, but 
money is flowing into equity funds again now that stocks have returned 
to near-record territory. The Investment Company Institute, a mutual 
fund trade group, reported Tuesday that $2.5 billion flowed into stock 
funds in October, the second lowest monthly total in seven years. 
October was the third straight month of greatly reduced cash flows 
for stock mutual funds. After receiving an average of $21 billion 
of net new investments in each of the year's first seven months, mutual 
funds lost $11 billion to investor withdrawals in August followed 
by $6.3 billion of new cash investments in September. But after stock 
prices continued their rebound late last month, investors again returned 
to buying fund shares. Through Monday, stock funds were receiving 
new investments at a monthly rate of nearly $13 billion, according 
to Trim Tabs Financial Services, which tracks fund cash flows. Moreover, 
several of the largest sellers of mutual funds reported significantly 
stronger cash flows. Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. has sold about $1.75 
billion of stock funds this month, it said Tuesday; in the previous 
two months, money flowed out or measured just a few million dollars 
of net deposits. Both Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group 
also reported heavy sales of stock funds so far this month. Nearly 
all of the money flowing into equities this month continues to go 
into funds that invest primarily in American stocks; international 
funds, which suffered net withdrawals in each of the last three months, 
appear to be barely breaking even in net flows. As the stock market 
gyrated from August and into October, mutual fund investors demonstrated 
growing interest in bond funds, generally a more conservative category 
of investment. Last month, bond funds added $4.6 billion in net new 
deposits, down from $5.6 billion in September. Hybrid funds, which 
invest in both stocks and bonds, saw investors withdraw $258 million 
last month, compared with withdrawals of $518 million in September. 
But money-market funds, generally the safest haven for mutual fund 
investors, received nearly $46 billion in new deposits last month, 
six times their September intake. Those amounts, combined with the 
more than $50 billion that money-market funds received in August, 
mean that plenty of money remains on the sidelines that could be moved 
into equities if the market continues to rise. About 26 percent of 
total mutual fund assets, which measure $5.12 trillion, now rest in 
money-market funds. That is up from 23 percent of fund assets at the 
end of last year. Within equity funds alone, 6 percent of assets are 
being held in cash reserves by portfolio managers. While that is down 
from 6.3 percent in September, it remains higher than in any other 
month in the last year.
