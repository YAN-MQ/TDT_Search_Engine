Attorney general Janet Reno says she will not seek an independent 
counsel to investigate vice President Gore. Reno says there is no 
evidence Gore lied to investigators who checked the financing of a 
democratic media fund. Gore's spokesman says the vice president is 
pleased with the decision. Other opinions were split along party lines. 
Obviously, the president welcomes that news as he has always believed 
that the vice president acted completely properly during the campaign 
in 1996. My personal belief is we're going to have to take this out 
of the hands of the attorney general, whoever the attorney general 
may be, because if attorneys general in the future act as politically 
as this one has, nobody's going to have confidence in them at ever 
getting to the bottom of these type of things. So I'm very concerned 
about it. And it's no secret that she's being advised by a former 
partner of David kendall down there at the justice department. And 
everybody in the world knows that. And that's one of the big problems. 
The justice department still is in the midst of 90-day preliminary 
inquiries about President Clinton's campaign practices and whether 
White House chief of staff Harold Ickes committed perjury. Reno must 
decide within two weeks if she will appoint independent counsels to 
continue those investigations.
