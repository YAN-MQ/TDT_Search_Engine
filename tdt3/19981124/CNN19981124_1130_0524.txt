New drug therapies have given hope to many people infected with HIV. 
But the drugs don't come cheap, and some people fear they might breed 
complacency in the fight against AIDS. Elizabeth Cohen has more. Most 
of the world cannot afford to spend nearly $20,000 a year per person 
for the HIV drugs that are keeping many Americans and Europeans alive. 
This epidemic is not losing its steam worldwide. Globally, 95% of 
all AIDS deaths are in the developing world, the vast majority in 
subsaharan Africa, where there are 5,500 funerals for people who've 
died of AIDS every day. One illustration of how severe the problem 
is -- in the city of mutare in zimbabwe, an estimated two out of every 
five pregnant women are HIV positive. The United Nations is pushing 
for the development of a vaccine and for more well-targeted prevention 
programs, like in Thailand. They've worked extensively with army recruits, 
making sure army recruits know all about the dangers awaiting them 
with unsafe sex. So they've seen rates among army recruits and army 
personnel come down pretty dramatically. But programs cost money, 
and many of the hardest-hit nations already have big debts. The United 
Nations is urging that these debts be forgiven, as several nations 
already plan to do for countries devastated by hurricane Mitch. I 
think it's certainly an emergency, equivalent to the emergency of 
a Natural disaster such as a hurricane. But the U.N. is worried that 
because of the success of the drug cocktails, Americans and Europeans 
have grown complacent about AIDS and won't do enough to help put a 
stop to the epidemic in poorer countries. Elizabeth Cohen, CNN, Atlanta.
