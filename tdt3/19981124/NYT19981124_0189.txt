Babe the pig, he of the sweet voice and twitchy pink snout, spends 
his second film in considerably more daunting surroundings than those 
of the Hoggetts (James Cromwell and Magda Szubanski) and their farm. 
In ``Babe: Pig in the City'' his new friends include chimps and a 
pit bull, signaling the obviously less lighthearted quality of this 
sequel. As directed once again by George Miller, Babe remains a cute 
little porker, but his fanciful new backdrops are less beguiling. 
Despite his mandate (from his dog mother, with the voice of Miriam 
Margolyes) to demonstrate ``how a kind and steady heart can mend a 
sorry world,'' Babe must contend here with many discouraging urban 
woes. Chief among them is Mickey Rooney as a dissipated circus clown, 
possibly cast here to show how much more refreshing Babe is than many 
human beings. This film's occasional taste for dark moments and unappetizing 
sights makes its G rating somewhat questionable for very young children. 
The plot contrives to send Farmer Hoggett down a well in a nasty accident. 
Then Babe and Esme Hoggett head for the city, hoping to save the farm. 
Much fun is made of Ms. Szubanski's sturdy Esme, who becomes the subject 
of endless fat jokes as well as a police strip-search at the airport. 
It seems that a drug-sniffing dog has detected contraband somewhere, 
and anyone eager to explain that to tots should have no problem with 
the rest of the story. It brings Babe and Esme to a fleabag _ the 
Flealands Hotel _ where animals are officially outlawed but actually 
welcome. Here, at this menagerie-filled version of the Chelsea, Babe 
finds the kind of urban demimonde he never saw on the farm. There 
is an orangutan named Thelonius (get it?) and a family of world-weary 
chimps (with Steven Wright providing the wise-guy father's voice, 
and Glenne Headly as the pregnant, floozyish mother). Continuing his 
walk on the wild side, Babe also meets a pink poodle with Blanche 
DuBois tendencies and squads of cats and dogs who behave like members 
of rival gangs. Sheepherding contests, anyone? There's plenty to be 
said about the urban troubles seen here, but it's not best heard out 
of the mouth of Babe. This visually ambitious film does concoct an 
elaborate pan-metropolis including traces of New York, Hollywood, 
San Francisco, Paris, Venice and so on. And the Flealands Hotel becomes 
an enveloping setting, even if its gloom spoils some of the fun. There's 
some good news in the fact that Babe's mouse friends come along for 
the journey, and that their musical tastes (``Non, Je Ne Regrette 
Rien,'' ``That's Amore,'' ``Are You Lonesome Tonight?'') remain as 
adorably eclectic as ever. The cats who greet them with a chorus of 
``Three Blind Mice'' are also a nice touch. But by the time Esme has 
wound up in the clown's purple suit and is swinging from a chandelier 
across a ballroom, this ``Babe'' has all but lost its bearings. It 
will work as a sequel only hard-core ``Babe'' fans willing to follow 
this four-legged hero (or heroine, as Babe obviously is in some scenes) 
anywhere. Had ``Pig in the City'' been made first, it by no means 
could have prompted a sequel of its own. PRODUCTION NOTES BABE, Pig
