And a look at a president past tonight, courtesy of the John F. Kennedy 
library. 37 hours of never before heard tape recordings of the president, 
released tonight. Some of the tapes were made in the oval office, 
some from phone calls, some were dictated notes. They all record the 
very end of the Kennedy legacy. Here's NBC's Fred Francis. The recordings 
show a decisive President Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis. 
But later, remorseful over a U.S.-sponsored coup in Vietnam. Kennedy, 
who would be killed just two weeks later, dictates his regrets over 
the assassination of the Vietnamese president. During the Cuban missile 
crisis, the tapes reveal that Kennedy learned from the bay of pigs 
crisis a year earlier to trust his own instincts. He listens to a 
very wide group of advisers suggesting things all the way from ignoring 
the missiles on the one hand to invading Cuba and bombing it on the 
other, but he keeps his own counsel. Kennedy, having already decided 
to make a deal with the Russians, calls President Eisenhower. What 
the tapes do not give us is Kennedy's own personal reflections of 
how and why he made those decisions. He never had the chance to record 
those thoughts. Fred Francis, NBC news, Washington.
