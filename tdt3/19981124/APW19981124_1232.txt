Venezuelan political parties have failed to agree on a unity candidate 
who could defeat a former coup plotter now leading all polls for next 
month's presidential elections, a top party official confirmed Tuesday. 
A unity candidate ``hasn't been possible due to individualism and 
conflicting personalities,'' Donald Ramirez, secretary-general of 
the Social Christian COPEI Party, said in an interview with The Associated 
Press. The failure will probably amount to yet another boost for Hugo 
Chavez, the populist former coup leader whose Patriotic Pole coalition 
won a plurality of Venezuela's bicameral legislature in Nov. 8 regional 
elections. Chavez is also the front-runner in the Dec. 6 presidential 
race. COPEI and its presidential candidate, former Miss Universe Irene 
Saez, began talks on Nov. 16 with candidates, parties, businessmen 
and the Catholic Church about creating a united front _ a so-called 
Democratic Pole _ to oppose Chavez's Patriotic Pole. The idea was 
to ``strengthen ourselves in order to defend democracy, institutions 
and our freedom,'' Ramirez said. Chavez led an unsuccessful military 
revolt against the government in 1992. His candidacy has polarized 
Venezuela between the poor who see him as a hero and the wealthy establishment 
that fears he will impose a dictatorship and roll back free-market 
economic reforms. Ramirez did not offer any specific reasons for the 
failure to agree, but acknowledged that one factor was the insistence 
by by the presidential candidate of the center-left Democratic Action 
Party, Luis Alfaro, that he be the unity candidate. Yale-trained businessman 
Henrique Salas is in second place in the polls. An independent, he 
has refused to join forces with COPEI and Democratic Action, apparently 
fearing association with discredited political parties could hurt 
his candidacy. Saez, the former beauty queen, has gone from first 
place in the polls to fourth in recent months.
