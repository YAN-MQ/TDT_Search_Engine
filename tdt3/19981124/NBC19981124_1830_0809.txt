NBC news "in depth" -- tonight, America's schools, coming up short. 
A new survey of education around the world finds this country's school 
children, once at the head of the class, now falling behind. As of 
last year, 82% of all Americans 25 and older, had completed high school 
almost 24% had earned a bachelor's degree. What do American kids know 
about the basics? NBC's Rehema Ellis begins tonight's "in depth" reporting. 
In the study of 41 nations, students tested from elementary to high 
school level, the United States, traditionally an academic leader, 
scored lower than nine countries in science, 20 nations in math, and, 
in some areas, ranked just ahead of Iran, Portugal, and Kuwait. And 
the other bad news this week -- in a statewide test in Massachusetts, 
two-thirds of all eighth graders failed or needed improvement in both 
math and science. I'm both frustrated and angry. Frustrated because 
I love the profession and I love the children and I want to see them 
do better. William schmitt, of Michigan state University who studies 
schools around the world, says the U.S. is sinking. By the time they 
go from 4th to 12th grade, our performance just continues to deteriorate, 
at least in our relative standing to other countries. And American 
high school graduation rates, for the first time ever, dropped below 
those of students in other major countries. It has to do with what 
we teach, our curriculum is just not up to international standards. 
Especially in the middle grades. So what is the problem and why can't 
we fix it? The main concerns, experts say, math and science. We're 
still teaching the old-fashioned way, focusing on basics, while other 
countries push students into algebra and physics earlier. The result 
-- a system failing too many students. But some students are fighting 
back. In this affluent Chicago suburb, 20 school districts came together 
to attack the problem. And in just three years, dramatic changes. 
Now eighth graders are scoring at the top. Here's what they did. Some 
middle school students now take algebra in the 8th grade instead of 
waiting until high school. Teachers interact more with the students 
and students, in turn, interact more with their subjects. Hands-on 
projects applying what they learn about science and math instead of 
just reading about it in a textbook. But for too many young students, 
the news is bleak tonight about their education and what it may mean 
for their future. Rehema Ellis, NBC news, New York.
