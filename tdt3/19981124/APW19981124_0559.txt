Opposition leaders said Tuesday they would not attend a meeting called 
by President Emil Constantinescu to discuss the country's strategy 
for NATO membership and dealing with a political crisis that is paralyzing 
economic reform. It was the latest standoff among Romania's politicians. 
The four-party ruling coalition is fractured by rifts, and dialogue 
between parties on different sides of the political divide is almost 
nonexistent. Last week, three opposition parties withdrew from parliament 
after their attempts to stage a no-confidence vote in the government 
were stymied by the government coalition parties. Opposition politicians 
said there was no point attending the meeting scheduled at the presidential 
palace later Tuesday. ``We agree that Romania should join NATO,'' 
said Corina Cretu, a spokeswoman from the main opposition Party of 
Social Democracy. ``The political crisis should be resolved in parliament, 
where it started.'' The nationalist Party of National Unity said the 
discussion about NATO was irrelevant because the governing coalition, 
which came to power two years ago, had hurt Romania's chances of joining 
the military alliance with its policies. Romania badly wanted to join 
NATO, but was told in July 1997 that it was not ready economically, 
unlike Hungary and the Czech Republic, its former Soviet block allies, 
which were invited to join. Romania still hopes for NATO membership, 
although its chances have diminished, partly due to political feuding 
and a failure to reform the economy.
