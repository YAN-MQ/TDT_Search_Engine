Attorney general Janet Reno has a tough decision to make, one that 
could drastically impact vice President Gore's political future. Pierre 
Thomas reports. CNN has learned some senior justice department officials 
are recommending that attorney general Janet Reno not seek an independent 
counsel to investigate vice President Gore's role in the 1996 campaign. 
If Al Gore dodges this bullet then he is 90% home to the democratic 
presidential nomination. If, however, he is haunted by an independent 
counsel, then all bets are off. The justice investigation centers 
around whether Gore lied to FBI agents about possibly illegal fund-raising 
calls he made from his office during the 1996 campaign. Gore said 
he only made calls for so-called "soft money," funds for general democratic 
party spending. But a recently discovered memo from a former Gore 
aide appears to contradict Gore's account. It talks about raising 
not only soft money for the party but also hard money aimed for the 
Clinton/Gore campaign. Federal law bans raising money for a specific 
campaign on federal property. A number of senior justice officials 
believe the memo is inconclusive. And so far, no one has come forward 
to say Gore solicited hard money in those phone calls. But FBI director 
Louis freeh continues to maintain there is a need for an independent 
counsel, citing conflict of interest. Gore's denied any wrongdoing, 
and some of his supporters say the investigation should end. There 
ought to be a pretty strong case before you even make the appointment. 
And that case seems utterly lacking against vice President Gore at 
this time. So Reno finds herself in a familiar position, having to 
make a Decision on the fate of a fellow administration official. And 
there's more to come. In the next two weeks, Reno also has decide 
whether to seek independent counsels to investigate former White House 
aide Harold Ickes and president clinton himself. Pierre Thomas, "CNN
