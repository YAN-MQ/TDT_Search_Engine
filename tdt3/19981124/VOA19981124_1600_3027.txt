The trade group of American industries, the National Association of 
Manufacturers, released Tuesday an upbeat economic forecast predicting 
only a slight slowdown in the U.S. growth rate for 1999. Correspondent 
Barry Wood reports the manufacturers say the U.S. trade account is 
deteriorating less than had been feared. The manufacturers say the 
U.S. economy is likely to expand by 2.3 percent next year. That would 
be only slightly less than the 1998 performance and is at variance 
with the forecasters who predict zero growth or recession. Trade group 
president Jerry Jasinowski says U.S. manufacturers, for the most part, 
remain healthy, despite a sharp drop in exports to the recession-plagued 
economies of East Asia. Mr. Jasinowski says the steep currency devaluations 
in Asia have not led to an anticipated rapid rise in U.S. imports. 
Well, I think it's largely because the economies that have been struck 
by recession and turmoil have had such a capital flight out and have 
had their GDP taken down so much that they are really just getting 
back to performing as normal economies able to expand production and 
exports. We may see more of it in the future, but, so far, we haven't 
seen very much of it because they've been so hard hit. The U.S. trade 
deficit is around $250 billion. The association says with 40 percent 
of the world economy in recession, U.S. exports are continuing to 
decline and causing the trade deficit to widen. Gordon Richards is 
the manufacturers' expert on trade. We've got net exports deteriorating 
by $50 billion next year which is about half the deterioration of 
this year. In essence, the rate of deterioration has slowed, but there's 
no improvement. Mr. Richards says the U.S. trade deficit will not 
begin to narrow for another 18 months. The manufacturers say the biggest 
risk for the U.S. economy is if Brazil's recession becomes deeper 
than expected and tips all of Latin America into recession. If that 
happens, they say, U.S. exports will fall further, reducing the growth 
rate by up to 1 percent. Barry Wood, VOA News, Washington.
