VOA news time,. This is VOA News Now from Washington. I'm Paul Westfeeling, 
along with Charlene Porter. Chinese officials in Beijing say that 
Sino-Russian relations have reached a new height as a result of President 
John Jumen's visit to Russian. VOA Stephanie Hill reports from Beijing, 
Mr. Jung's next stop is Japan, where he and Prime Minister, Kaezo 
Abuchee, are expected to tackle a broad range of issues. At a regular 
briefing for reporters, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Tung Boy 
Chung,, declared, through an interpreter, that President Jung's meeting 
with President Boris Yeltsin, was a success. They had the first informal 
summit of the heads of state. With Jungs that through the reach over 
meeting between the leaders of the two countries, with understanding 
and trust, have reached a new height. The Chinese spokesman said China 
expressed appreciation that Russia recognizes only one China, and 
does not support independence for Taiwan, an island Beijing regards 
as a renegade province. He added that Russia will not sell weapons 
to Taiwan. United States arms sales to Taiwan are a major irritant 
in relations between Beijing and Washington. After he leaves Moscow 
on Wednesday, President Jung will make the first, ever, visit by any 
Chinese leader, to Japan. Mr. Chung says the issue of Taiwan, which 
is a former Japanese colony, is at the top of the agenda. Only by 
summoning up and frequent and currently handling the province of Taiwan, 
the bonds of relations between nations China and Japan can develop 
smoothly. Other issues that are bound to come up include stronger 
military ties between Japan and the United States, regional economic 
troubles, and an expected apology from Japan for its brutal occupation 
of parts of China during World War II. Stephanie Hill, VOA News, Beijing.
