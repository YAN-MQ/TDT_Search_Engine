In the northwest today, more than 300,000 people are still without 
power after a storm that rushed through the region yesterday. There 
were 90 mile-an-hour winds in Washington state and Oregon, and heavy 
snow in northern California and Nevada. Forecasters are predicting 
more bad weather, which brings us to their tools, their newest tools. 
Here is ABC's Bill Blakemore. The weather battering the northwest 
will be a lot easier for scientists to understand, because of a powerful 
new American/Japanese satellite now sending back pictures. The satellite 
nicknamed trim lets meteorologists see into storm clouds. We've seen 
hurricane clouds not like any other we've seen. Trim's X-Ray view 
discovered towers of heavy rain grouped like manhattan skyscrapers. 
They discovered whenever a very tall rain tower formed, the hurricane 
suddenly intensify ied. What this rainfall provides us is a signature 
of the fuel supply that drives the climate engine. Scientists never 
knew before how to predict when a hurricane would intensify. This 
may save many lives. This also helping explain and predict the heavy 
storms already hitting the west this fall. It's teaching us something 
brand new about the likelihood of lightning damage from storms. Scientists 
thought lightning cob predicted by the amount of rain. Trim shows 
it cannot. It found 95% of lightning is over land, but over the oceans, 
with just as much rainfall, there's almost no lightning. Bill Blakemore,
