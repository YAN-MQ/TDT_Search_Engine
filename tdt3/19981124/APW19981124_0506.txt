Hundreds of Palestinians marched Tuesday in the funeral procession 
of a 23-year-old university student who was found beaten to death 
near a Jewish settlement. Two dozen Palestinians broke away from the 
march and threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli troops who responded 
with rubber bullets, injuring one protester. Palestinian security 
chief Jibril Rajoub and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement 
blamed Jewish settlers for the death of Sabah Abu Sneineh, whose body 
was found Saturday in an abandoned building near the Neve Daniel settlement. 
However, Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said there was no 
reason to believe settlers were involved in the killing. She said 
Israeli police suspected Palestinian assailants were responsible for 
the woman's death. Menuhin did not offer a possible motive. However, 
each year there are several incidents in which Palestinian women are 
slain by male relatives over perceived violations of the family's 
honor. In a leaflet circulated on Monday, Fatah said Abu Sneineh was 
a ``daughter of Fatah'' and claimed settlers killed her in hopes of 
disrupting the implementation of the recent land-for-security agreement 
between Israel and the Palestinians. In Tuesday's funeral procession, 
Abu Sneineh's body was wrapped in a Palestinian flag and carried through 
the streets of Hebron. Some 400 Palestinians joined the march, many 
of them Fatah members. ``We do not want to see any settlers,'' the 
crowed chanted. Some 20 Palestinians threw rocks and empty bottles 
at Israeli troops standing at a checkpost near the cemetery. Israeli 
troops are deployed in downtown Hebron to protect about 450 Jewish 
settlers living there. The Palestinian Authority controls the remainder 
of the city of 130,000 Palestinians.
