Joe DiMaggio, who has been hospitalized for more than a month, has 
lung cancer and had a heart attack last week, TV station WPIX reported. 
The station, which televised New York Yankees games for 48 years, 
on Monday night cited three sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
WPIX news executives declined to elaborate on the sourcing. DiMaggio's 
lawyer denied that the Hall of Famer, who turns 84 on Wednesday, had 
a heart attack or was gravely ill. ``This is totally false,'' Morris 
Engelberg said Tuesday. ``Mr. DiMaggio and his family heard this information 
on the television and were very upset.'' WTVJ-TV, an NBC affiliate 
in Miami, cited unidentified sources close to DiMaggio to say it confirmed 
he had a heart attack and has lung cancer. The station also said he 
was on a ventilator. Engelberg did not say whether DiMaggio had cancer 
or surgery to remove a lung tumor. The lawyer's office said he was 
not available to elaborate. DiMaggio has been hospitalized in Hollywood, 
Florida, since Oct. 12 for what Engelberg said was pneumonia and a 
lung infection. However, WPIX said DiMaggio had a tumor removed from 
his lung last month. The station added that when Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner canceled a visit last week, he was told DiMaggio ``probably 
wouldn't have recognized him anyway.'' The report also said friends 
of DiMaggio were concerned about who was in control of his estate, 
which WPIX said includes a collectible and memorabilia fortune worth 
about dlrs 20 million. Personnel at Memorial Regional Hospital have 
not provided information on DiMaggio's condition; switchboard operators 
have even denied DiMaggio is a patient. Engelberg said Tuesday that 
DiMaggio had told him not to discuss his health with anyone other 
than his doctors or immediate family. The lawyer, a longtime friend, 
said the baseball great would celebrate his birthday at the hospital 
with his grandchildren, great grandchildren, brother Dom and some 
of the hospital staff. Engelberg said he would be there as well.
