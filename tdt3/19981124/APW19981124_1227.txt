A Brazilian court will again consider reducing the sentences of eight 
convicted kidnappers in a bid to end a hunger strike. Ten justices 
of the Sao Paulo criminal court agreed Tuesday to reconsider 26-to-28-year 
sentences of five Chileans, two Argentines and a Brazilian imprisoned 
since 1989 for the kidnapping of Abilio Diniz, a supermarket magnate, 
human rights activist Breno Altman said. Last Friday, two Canadians 
who belonged to the group, David Spencer and Christine Lamont, took 
advantage of a prisoner transfer treaty between Canada and Brazil 
and were flown to a Vancouver prison. The Sao Paulo court agreed to 
reconsider the sentences last April after the kidnappers went on a 
16-day hunger strike. But a lack of movement on the mattter led the 
kidnappers to re-start the hunger strike eight days ago. The prisoners' 
lawyers want the court to reduce the sentences to 8 years, the original 
time given the five Chileans in 1990 before being increased the next 
year to the the maximum penalty by an appellate court. The five would 
then be expelled from Brazil since they have completed their time. 
Although the other three _ two Argentines and a Brazilian _ were originally 
sentenced to between 12-to-15 years, they would not accept anything 
more than eight years, and would continue to drink only water. ``Only 
their immediate release can stop the hunger strike,'' said Altman, 
president of the Sao Paulo-based Committee to Free Political Prisoners. 
Chilean Maria Emilia Marchi was transferred Tuesday to Sao Paulo's 
Mandaqui hospital, suffering from a high fever and a urinary tract 
infection. The health of the others has also deteriorated, according 
to prison physician Ricardo Cypriani. Prison authorities have placed 
the mattresses of the weakest inmates on the floor for fear they will 
fall out of bed. All have lost considerable weight. At their trial, 
the kidnappers claimed to be political prisoners since they belonged 
to a leftist group that wanted to funnel the dlrs 30 million ransomto 
Salvadoran guerrillas, who were then waging war against that nation's 
right-wing government. Diniz was held hostage for six days in an underground 
cell before police freed him unharmed. Officials from the Argentine 
and Chilean consulates visited the inmates this week, pleading with 
them to end the hunger strike and wait for Brazilian authorities to 
resolve their case.
