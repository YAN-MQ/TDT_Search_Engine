Time for a look at the weather across the country. For that we go 
across the river to WNBC television in New York in New York where 
meteorologist Janice huff is standing by. Hi, jodi. A lot of folks 
on the road for this holiday, of course, already getting a head start. 
Tomorrow will be the biggest day for travel. We still have that storm 
winding up across the pacific northwest. Heavy rains and gusty winds 
again. Some light snow along the northern Rockies. Rest of the country 
relatively quiet the a few light showers over the northeast. 48 degrees 
in New York City. Look at all the mild air over the central plains. 
But tonight most of the nation dropping down into the 20's and 30's 
for lows. The interior west, Rockies and most of the northeast. Chilliest 
air up near the Canadian worder. Rest of the country, 40's, 50's, 
60 ps and 70's for the southern half. Now, tomorrow being a big travel 
day, you're looking at the jet stream pattern. Still stormy in the 
pacific north wrevt. Places like Portland and Seattle will continue 
to see heavy rain and high wind. It will continue warm over most of 
the southern states. Even as far north as Lincoln, Nebraska, temperatures 
may be in the 60's. Showers in the Ohio valley. By Thanksgiving day 
the showers spread east into the New England states and the northeast. 
By Friday, cooler air building across the pacific northwest, more 
rain expected there. Still sun shine and mild temperatures across 
the southern half of the country. In New England, some heavy snow 
developing by Friday. That's the weather around the nation, jodi. 
Now back to you.
