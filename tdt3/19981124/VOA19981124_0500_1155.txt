A couple of players changing uniforms in Major League baseball -- 
the Atlanta Braves have a new outfielder. He's free agent Brian Jordan, 
who agreed to a five-year, $40 million deal. Jordan played for the 
St. Louis Cardinals, last season, where he set career highs with a 
3-16 batting average and 25 home runs. Jordan also drove in 91 runs. 
He's looking forward to joining his new team. I've always respected 
the Atlanta Braves to the utmost. It's a great organization. They're 
committed to winning. And, it's always a player's dream to play for 
an organization that's committed to winning, and they've shown it 
year after year. Jordan is from the Atlanta area and says playing 
near his family was a major factor in joining the Braves.
