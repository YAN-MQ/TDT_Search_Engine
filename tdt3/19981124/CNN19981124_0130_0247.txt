Baghdad says it will be willing to show the United Nations its notes 
describing weapons used during the Iran/Iraq war. The U.N. has requested 
Iraq hand over all of its weapons documents. Iraq says it will show 
the documents to inspectors in the presence of U.N. special envoy 
prakah Shah, who arrived in Baghdad Monday. The Iraqi deputy prime 
minister says any other information already has been handed over or 
does not exist. We wanted to make clear that Iraq is in no way showing 
any sign of noncooperation. Iraq wants to cooperate because we want 
to finish this whole job of the work of UNSCOM and to move forward 
with the comprehensive review. The boy has cried wolf too many times 
on the fact that they have provided all the documents. And therefore, 
the Burden of proof is very clearly on them. In another development, 
one of Saddam Hussein's advisers survived an assassination attempt. 
Ibrahim serves on the relation uegsary command council. He wasn't 
hurt, but several body guards were.
