Then there is this, the economy is booming. The jobs are there for 
the taking but too often, qualified applicants are too hard to find. 
NBC's Dan Lothian continues our "in depth" reporting. When education 
suffers, computer giant Hewlett-Packard says it feels the pain. We're 
concerned about the future. Where is the work force going to come 
from? Not enough skilled workers, forcing Silicon Valley companies 
to recruit some employees overseas. It's hard sometimes to find workers 
who want to go and fill the jobs where they exist. With an estimated 
340,000 high-tech jobs unfilled, companies are now pressuring Congress 
to let 190,000 more well-trained immigrants into this country. And 
it's not just Silicon Valley. Just outside Atlanta, Georgia, Jack 
Becker was in charge of hiring at this lighting company. Outraged 
by unqualified job candidates from local schools, he ran for school 
superintendent, and won. If we had all of our employees met a higher 
minimum standard of education, we would be a more effective, profitable 
business. According to one survey by the national association of manufacturers, 
88% of companies say they have a hard time finding qualified workers. 
60% reject one-half of all applicants. And one-third say, even the 
basics are difficult to find. In California, governor elect Gray Davis 
says an education overhaul is critical to the state's future. We can't 
sustain this pros peerty without O O more educated work force. And 
while some companies fill vacancies with overseas help. We will have 
to compete at the low end of the labor market. Where wages have been 
stag innocent. The problem is getting worse. 1.3 million new information 
technology workers will be needed. But some believe our educational 
system is not producing the right candidates for those jobs. Dan Lothian, 
NBC news, Los Angeles.
