We are going to take "A closer look" tonight at why there is so much 
buzz about some of the Internet stocks. Let's be clear -- it is not 
unique for a company that has never made a Profit to be a promising 
stock. Not at all. But as we take a closer look at Wall Street this 
evening, notice what these internet companies listed on the stock 
market have been trading at since the beginning of September -- American 
online, Yahoo!, Amazon.com and excite. They are all doubling or tripling 
in stock value like nobody's business. If America online hadn't split 
its stock 2 for 1, it would be over 180. Here's the important point. 
America online is the only one in that group earning a profit. The 
question is why are the other stocks doing so well when they aren't 
showing any profit? ABC's Robert Krulwich tonight on Amazon.com. What's 
going on here? The stock market right now says Amazon.com, a ur-yeaol 
company that lets you order books through your computer is worth $11 
billion, as of yesterday's close. That's big. That's as big as Nike. 
Nike, the sneaker company. Which is shocking because Amazon doesn't 
have any earnings at this point. So why do so many people want to 
buy this stock? Particularly, the number one Internet book seller 
because it is widely believed on the Internet if people know who you 
are and they know how to find you and they know how to use you, once 
clearly, Amazon.com has momentum of people. One way to explain the 
extraordinary success of leading Internet businesses this week is 
-- this is a big vote for businesses that are light on their feet. 
The lighter the better. And if they aren't making money yet, a lot 
of folks believe that once they begin to turn a profit, they're going 
to make a fortune. Robert Krulwich, ABC News, New York. Still without 
making a profit it's hard to figure out if companies such as amazon.com 
are overpriced. One of America's most successful investors said if 
he were quizzing business students on Internet companies, this is 
what he would do for the final examine. I would take a company and 
say how much is this really worth? Anybody with an answer, I would 
flunk.
