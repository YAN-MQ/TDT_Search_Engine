Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew has been released from a hospital 
after recovering from an infection, a government statement said Tuesday. 
But Lee, 75, will complete a course of intravenous antibiotics as 
an outpatient. He was hospitalized Saturday for treatment of the infection 
following a minor surgical procedure. Lee was discharged Monday from 
National University Hospital by his doctor, Associate Professor John 
Wong. No details on the nature of the infection or the surgical procedure 
were disclosed. The former prime minister and architect of modern 
Singapore, who remains a powerful voice on domestic and international 
affairs, has enjoyed good health since two angioplasty operations 
in 1996 to clear a blocked heart artery.
