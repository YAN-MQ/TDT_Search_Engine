A car bomb exploded in front of the German Embassy Tuesday, killing 
three people including two policemen, witnesses said. The bomb shattered 
windows and sent shards of glass flying into the embassy and damaged 
parts of the wall, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
No one at the embassy was injured, said a German diplomat also insisting 
on anonymity. Among those killed was a police major who was visiting 
the policemen in charge of the embassy's security. A lieutenant posted 
in the diplomatic neighborhood also was killed, security officials 
said. The third victim was a Yemeni boy who was in a car passing by, 
said the officials who spoke on customary condition of anonymity. 
Six people were taken by ambulance to hospitals, and many others suffered 
minor wounds. Two of them were discharged from hospital later in the 
day, the security officials said. The explosion set a nearby car on 
fire but firefighters put out the blaze, the witnesses said. The Mazda 
car carrying the bomb was parked outside the embassy in the residential 
Hadda area, where most embassies are located. The German embassy is 
next to the house of prominent political figure, Sheik Mohammed bin 
Shajeh, who security officials suspect may have been the target of 
the attack. The site was cordoned off by police, who refused to allow 
anyone to enter or leave the area. No other details were available. 
Yemen, a poor nation of 17 million on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, 
is largely inhabited by tribes who do not hesitate to use firearms 
to settle scores with rivals or to express discontent with the government.
