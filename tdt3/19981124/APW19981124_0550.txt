Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan criticized the Russian government 
for its refusal to grant him political asylum in an interview published 
Tuesday. His plea for asylum was backed by the Communist-led Russian 
parliament, but Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov responded with ``a 
firm no,'' Ocalan said in an interview with the Russian business daily 
Kommersant. ``I believe that decision was a mistake.'' Ocalan leads 
the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a 14-year-old 
war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has 
killed 37,000 people. He is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges 
of leading a terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial 
integrity and ordering killings. The charges can bring the death penalty. 
Ocalan was freed from a Rome hospital Saturday by a court decision. 
He had been in custody since he arrived in Italy on a false passport 
Nov. 12. Ocalan said Moscow had refused to offer him asylum because 
of pressure from United States and Turkey. ``I don't bear any grudge 
against Russia,'' Ocalan said in the interview. ``Your country is 
in a difficult position itself.'' Ocalan was speaking from Italy, 
where he said he was staying in a ``reliable place'' under the protection 
of both his bodyguards and the Italian police. Ocalan said he had 
to fled his base in Syria in October after Turkey threatened air strikes, 
and arrived in Russia on Oct. 9 on a false passport because he had 
failed to receive Moscow's permission to enter. He said he was initially 
staying in Moscow suburbs, but gave himself away by using his cellular 
phone to call his comrades abroad, which allowed the Israeli intelligence 
service Mossad to trace him and alert Turkey. When Turkish officials 
began asking Moscow about his whereabouts, Ocalan fled to other former 
Soviet republics and finally landed in Rome. An Italian court refused 
to consider a Turkish arrest warrant because of Italy's policy against 
extradition of any person who could face the death penalty. Ocalan 
said in the interview that he hopes to get asylum in Italy as early 
as this month. Turkish Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Turkey 
would make a formal request for extradition later this week.
