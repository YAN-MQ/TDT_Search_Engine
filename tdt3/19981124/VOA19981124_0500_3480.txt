This story comes to us from Boulder, Colorado, kind of a warning to 
watch what you leave in your car. Recently, a fellow out that way 
was awakened in the middle of the night, when he heard the sound of 
his own car horn. Naturally, he wants to know why it's blasting as 
it is, and he goes out to the care, and he doesn't find a car thief. 
Nay, Nay. He finds a bear in his car. Whew! A big fat bear who was 
trying to get out of the guy's sports car. The bear wasn't looking 
for a ride when it got into the car. It was just looking for something 
to eat. And a local game warden said the bear was probably attracted 
to the car by the smell of fast-food wrappers that had been left inside. 
Oh, love those three-week old cheeseburgers. Yes, well all they had 
to do was just open the car and the bear jumped out. But, that could 
be -- just remember what you leave in your car.
