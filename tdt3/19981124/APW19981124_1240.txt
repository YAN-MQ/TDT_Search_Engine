Venezuelan President Alberto Fujimori said Tuesday that he has yet 
to decide whether he will run for a third consecutive term in office 
_ a possibility that has triggered a bitter constitutional debate. 
Fujimori was responding to reports that members of his family had 
said he would not run again in 2000. ``My family members cannot detect 
my thoughts because there is no such thing as a thought detector,'' 
Fujimori told reporters. ``I have not decided anything.'' Peru's 1993 
Constitution prohibits the president from running for three consecutive 
terms, but the government-controlled Congress has passed legislation 
circumventing the apparent constitutional ban on his candidacy. That 
move has been decried by opposition legislators as a blatant attempt 
to keep the road open for a possible re-election bid. A November poll 
by the company Apoyo showed that Fujimori's approval rating has fallen 
to 32 percent, one of its lowest points in his eight-year tenure as 
president. The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percent. Caretas, 
Peru's leading newsmagazine, speculated last week that the low public 
support and Fujimori's health made it unlikely he would run again. 
The magazine said a May 1997 operation for a benign tumor in Fujimori's 
mouth had failed to catch the growth and it had become malignant. 
Caretas gave no source for the information, but rumors about Fujimori's 
failing health have circulated for months. Fujimori was elected as 
a political outsider in 1990 and re-elected in a landslide in 1995.
