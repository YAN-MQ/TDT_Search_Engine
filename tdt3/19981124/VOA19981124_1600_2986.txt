The government revised upward today the rate of U.S. economic growth 
in the third quarter. Now this new figure shows growth at an almost 
4-percent annual rate, instead of the 3.3 percent originally estimated. 
American consumers may continue to fuel growth. The latest Index of 
Consumer Confidence is up almost 7 points after four straight months 
of decline.
