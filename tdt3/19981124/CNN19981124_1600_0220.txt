The Clinton administration says U.S. adoptions are on the rise. It's 
the first increase since the government began tracking adoptions in 
1980. President Clinton is releasing the new data at a White House 
ceremony today. Between 1996 and 1997, adoptions were up 10%, increasing 
from 28,000 to 31,000. There are 100,000 children still waiting to 
find a new home, with the average wait three years. Well, some of 
it's bureaucracy and some of it's the law. But we've been able to 
streamline the process, and that's the reason for the increase in 
adoptions. And we're going to give some awards today to some states 
and communities that have really cut down the waiting time. There 
really is no excuse to keep a child in Foster care for that long. 
Nearly three-quarters of children awaiting adoption have special needs. 
Some are older, some have emotional and physical disabilities and 
some are affected by HIV or drugs.
