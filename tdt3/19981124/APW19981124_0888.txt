Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet will learn Wednesday 
whether he has diplomatic immunity that would block his extradition 
to Spain to face charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. A five-judge 
tribunal in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court, is considering 
Spanish and British authorities' appeal of a High Court ruling holding 
that Pinochet is entitled to immunity for any crimes committed while 
a head of state. Pinochet, who turns 83 on Wednesday, was arrested 
on a Spanish arrest warrant Oct. 16 while in a London hospital recuperating 
from back surgery. If the House of Lords rules that he cannot be held 
accountable for crimes committed during his 1973-1990 tenure in office, 
Britain will release him. Meanwhile, he remains in a London hospital 
awaiting the Lords' ruling _ although lawyers say he is well enough 
to be moved. A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were killed 
or disappeared at the hands of security forces after Pinochet overthrew 
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. Several other countries have 
filed complaints against Pinochet, including France, which sources 
told The Associated Press issued a second international arrest warrant 
Tuesday. But Britain would not be able to act on any warrants if the 
Lords tribunal upholds Pinochet's immunity. A win for prosecutors 
would touch off a lengthy extradition battle. The spotlight would 
focus on British Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has Spain's formal 
extradition request on his desk, along with similar requests from 
France and Switzerland. The Bow Street magistrates court has set a 
Dec. 2 deadline for Straw to decide whether to allow the Spanish extradition 
request to go before the courts. On the same day, if his health permitted, 
Pinochet would make his first public appearance since his arrest at 
a preliminary hearing at Bow Street. A medically equipped Chilean 
Air Force jet has been standing by at an air base in Oxfordshire since 
Pinochet's arrest, awaiting his release.
