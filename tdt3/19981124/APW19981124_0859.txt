Pope John Paul II granted a brief audience Tuesday to Congolese President 
Laurent Kabila, urging him to seek a negotiated end to the civil war 
in his troubled African nation. Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls 
said Kabila also met with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal 
Angelo Sodano, and with Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the secretary 
for foreign relations. Navarro-Valls said the nearly 4-month-old conflict 
in Congo dominated the talks. The Holy See, he said, urged a ``dialogue 
on either the international or national level'' to achieve ``a peaceful 
solution that safeguards the principles of territorial integrity and 
national sovereignty with respect for the rights of each individual 
and social group.'' Kabila's roughly 20-minute papal audience came 
a day after Amnesty International issued a report on atrocities by 
both Kabila's forces and the rebels. The international human rights 
group said both were waging war against civilians. Protesters jeered 
Kabila as he went into a later meeting with Italian President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro, calling him ``assassin.'' Navarro-Valls acknowledged 
some ``perplexity'' over the pope's willingness to meet with Kabila. 
``To this, our response has always been that you have to keep in mind 
that the pope listens to everybody, and that for obvious reasons, 
he is probably the only person that in certain cases can make profound 
ethical reflections with anyone, something that other people can't 
do,'' the Vatican spokesman said. ``So when there's an occasion for 
the pope to make his voice heard, to express thoughts on ethics to 
certain people, I don't see the reason for such perplexity,'' Navarro-Valls 
said. ``He understands the problem, he knows the problem,'' Kabila 
said afterward of the pontiff. ``The pope said `We want everybody 
to respect other countries.' This is the good message he has given 
us and to the whole community of the West.'' Kabila also met with 
members of Sant' Egidio, a Roman Catholic group trying to arrange 
talks for the Congo, as it has in other international conflicts. There 
was no immediate word on any outcome. Congolese rebels have urged 
the pontiff and European leaders to pressure Kabila to negotiate a 
cease-fire directly with them. Kabila has refused direct talks, demanding 
instead that neighboring Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their support 
for the insurgents and leave Congo. He rejected the idea once again 
on Tuesday. ``There are no rebels in our country,'' he told Associated 
Press Television News. ``There are puppets used by the invaders of 
our country.'' Both countries accuse Kabila of failing to rid the 
common border of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels and say they'll stay as 
long as Congo remains unstable. Kabila, who took power after toppling 
the late President Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, is on his first European 
tour since the Aug. 2 rebellion against him began. After Rome, he 
goes to Brussels and Paris for a summit for French-speaking African 
nations on Thursday.
