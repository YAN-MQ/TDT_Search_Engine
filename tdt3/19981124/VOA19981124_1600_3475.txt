Most Americans in just a few days will be celebrating our annual Thanksgiving, 
and in a decades-old Thanksgiving tradition, President Clinton has 
used the awesome powers of his office to save a turkey's life. At 
a White House Rose Garden ceremony today, Mr. Clinton granted a full 
pardon to a 20-kilogram turkey to keep it off the dinner table for 
the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. President Truman began that 
tradition in 1947. Mr. Clinton said Americans have much to be thankful 
for this year in a time of prosperity, but he said there are still 
people who need concern and caring and must not be forgotten.
