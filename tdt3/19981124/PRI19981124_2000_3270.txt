Today's musical finale takes us to the Dominican Republic. The World's 
Marco Werman introduces us to a Latino singer who's hot in Europe 
and lukewarm in the States. He layers hip-hop over meringue and every 
now and then dips his musical toes in jazz and reggae. Mangu is his 
name. Born in the Dominican Republic, raised in New York City, Mangu 
now makes his home in Miami. In its promotional copy, Polygram, his 
record company, applauds Mangu for his ability to "drop sizzling rhymes 
in both Spanish and English." Here's Mangu's English rap on his track 
"Sin Ti Por" -- "Without You." MANGU Because you was with me even 
when I had no dinero. Now I'm living like the fellow sipping sweet 
amaretto. Take you see the soul train, the works of Othello. Your 
papa's mellow. You on a whole other level, not just sexual. You're 
a deep intellectual. Next to you, I'm moving 360 energy. Building 
on the future and the past just we let it be. And here's Mangu's Spanish 
cover of the same tune. Neat marketing technique, Mr. Mangu, knocking 
off two demographics with one CD. But the strategy hasn't seduced 
everyone. One reviewer with the online magazine dailymix.com said 
of Mangu's debut release, "The guest artists steal the show, and from 
a hip-hop standpoint, his rhymes are forgettable." Those guest artists 
include merengue great Johnny Pacheco, featured here on the track 
"Calle Luna, Calle Sol." But here's the rub. Mangu may not have hit 
paydirt in the United States, but in Europe, it's a whole other story. 
It's European wide, but certainly the leader so far in Europe with 
Mangu is France. That's Faisal Durani of Polygram International, who's 
primarily responsible for Mangu's extensive airplay in Europe. There's 
a big movement in France towards Latin-based music and also towards 
rap and hip-hop. And, you know, to find an artist who fuses the two 
together is really exciting for the French market. Polygram says they've 
sold a mere 10,000 copies domestically of Mangu's CD. To boost those 
numbers, Mangu's handlers may just have to sell him stateside as a 
Dominican-born, American-raised genuine European success story. For 
The World, this is Marco Werman. MANGU to take your life, he was a 
pure Mafioso. mangu. mangu
