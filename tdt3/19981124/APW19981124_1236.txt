Surrounded by pageantry, Queen Elizabeth II opened a new session of 
Parliament on Tuesday with a starkly untraditional announcement: The 
government plans to strip unelected aristocrats of their 600-year-old 
birthright to vote in the House of Lords. Rows of lords in ermine-collared 
scarlet robes broke with another tradition after the announcement, 
when instead of listening to the monarch in silence they let out muted 
growls. Elected lawmakers of the House of Commons who clustered behind 
the Lords chamber also violated the tradition with occasional cheers. 
The move is part of a legislative program for the coming year that 
the queen, reading out a speech written by Prime Minister Tony Blair's 
Labor government, described as focusing ``upon the modernization of 
the country.'' Well, a bit of modernization. With Her Majesty's assent, 
for example, the Lord Chancellor _ the country's chief judicial officer 
_ turned his back on the queen and walked away after handing her the 
government's speech, instead of shuffling backward. And a handful 
of quaintly named officials, such as Silver Stick in Waiting and Maltravers 
Herald Extraordinary, were absent. But much of the elaborate show 
was right on track. The queen rode from Buckingham Palace with her 
husband, Prince Philip, in a horse-drawn carriage escorted by a cavalry 
regiment in scarlet and gold tunics astride magnificent horses. An 
official called Black Rod, in knee breeches and stockings, summoned 
the commoners to the chamber to hear the queen. And even though the 
Lord Chancellor thought it all right to turn his back, others inched 
backward ahead of the queen. The legislative program she read out 
_ the second since Labor swept the long-ruling Conservative Party 
from office 19 months ago _ also included a shakeup of welfare benefits 
designed to make things tougher for the work-shy, a reform of legal 
funding and greater protection for rape victims. But one item promises 
to provoke the most debate. ``A bill will be introduced to remove 
the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords,'' 
the queen intoned. ``It will be the first stage of a process of reform 
to make the House of Lords more democratic and representative.'' The 
House of Lords, which revises and examines government legislation, 
is composed of lords who inherited their titles, and life peers, who 
are awarded titles. The elected House of Commons has the power to 
pass legislation even if the House of Lords rejects it, but the nobles 
can stretch out the process, stalling bills for months. Critics charge 
that Blair is wrong to remove the often independent-minded blue bloods 
before setting up a new arrangement. A commission is due to report 
within two years on a new version of the chamber. ``He wants to create 
a House of Cronies, beholden to him alone,'' Conservative Party leader 
William Hague jeered at Blair in the Commons later Tuesday. Some blue 
bloods prepared for a filibuster in the chamber, which could delay 
the legislation for up to a year. ``It is exceedingly easy to bung 
up the system,'' said the Earl of Onslow, whose family motto is ``Quick 
without Impetuosity.'' ``I am happy to go to this sort of extent and 
length to make sure that what comes after me is better and can act 
as a check,'' he said.''
