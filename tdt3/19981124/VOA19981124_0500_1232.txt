National Basketball Association team owners and players are still 
not talking, despite a looming deadline that could wipe out the entire 
season. No new talks were scheduled in New York, as both sides appeared 
to be taking time to review their positions on pay and other issues. 
The League canceled regular season games for the end of November, 
for the first time in NBA history, because of the labor dispute. The 
two sides have not been able to agree on a division of nearly $2 billion 
in annual revenues.
