President Joseph Estrada has turned down appeals from the Vatican 
and other countries for the Philippines to cancel its first execution 
in 22 years and repeal the death penalty, his spokesman said Tuesday. 
The Vatican, the European Union and Canada recently sent appeals to 
the Philippine government arguing that the death penalty would not 
reduce widespread crime, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said. A 
Philippine judge has ordered prison authorities to execute Leo Echegaray, 
convicted of repeatedly raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, but ordered 
the execution date kept secret. The scheduled execution has triggered 
a debate over the death penalty that has divided many Filipinos. ``President 
Estrada has a constitutional duty to see to it that laws are faithfully 
executed and the law requires the execution. He has to obey the law,'' 
presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said. The ambassadors of Canada 
and Austria and an official of the British Embassy met Siazon Tuesday 
to express their opposition to the death penalty. ``We are 100 percent 
against the death penalty for humanitarian cause,'' said Wolfgang 
Jilly of Austria, who also represented the European Union. Estrada 
has refused to pardon Echegaray, saying the execution would deter 
similar crimes. ``I am very firm with my decision because I know there 
will still be many who will try to commit rape. There are so many 
rape cases in the country, so this is one way of teaching them a lesson,'' 
Estrada said. Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row 
inmates to be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on death 
row were convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children 
or other relatives. Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 
84 people. Another defendant, Pablito Andan, who was convicted of 
rape and murder, is also scheduled to be executed this year but is 
appealing his sentence. At least five others whose sentences have 
been upheld by the Supreme Court may be executed next year, officials 
said. Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said he has learned that Echegaray 
may be executed sometime in January. He said he plans to ask the Supreme 
Court to compel Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional 
Trial Court to publicly reveal the exact date of execution. Under 
current government rules, authorities are forbidden from informing 
Echegaray of his impending execution until after sunrise on execution 
day. Cuevas, however, said the rules don't prohibit the date from 
being disclosed publicly. In 1987, a new constitution abolished the 
death penalty but gave Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' 
crimes such as murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking. 
Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option, bringing 
back the death penalty in 1994. Many Filipinos say the death penalty 
will deter crime, and that crime remains rampant because no one has 
been executed. Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed 
to the death penalty say there is no proof of that, and that poor 
people are more likely to be sentenced to death because they cannot 
afford good lawyers.
