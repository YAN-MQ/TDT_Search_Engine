Germany's newly elected government Tuesday backed away from a threat 
to press NATO to renounce a central tenet of its strategy and to pledge 
never to be the first to use nuclear weapons. After meeting at the 
Pentagon with Defense Secretary William Cohen, German Defense Minister 
Rudolf Scharping said that ``there is no intention in my government 
to question any core element of NATO strategy, including the fact 
that nuclear forces play a fundamental political role.'' American 
officials said they were alarmed when the new German foreign minister, 
Joschka Fischer, a member of the environmentalist Green Party, suggested 
in a magazine interview published this week that Germany would press 
NATO to renounce the possible first use of nuclear arms. Cohen publicly 
rebuffed the German proposal. Welcoming Scharping's remarks Tuesday, 
Cohen said that NATO's nuclear policy should remain unchanged. ``Based 
on my conversations with Minister Scharping,'' Cohen said, ``I think 
that we have a meeting of the minds _ that the strategic concept is 
critical for NATO's security, that the strategic concept as far as 
the nuclear component should not be altered.'' The United States is 
firmly opposed to any change in the doctrine allowing NATO to make 
first use of nuclear weapons in a war, arguing that it proved an effective 
deterrent during the cold war and remains one today against small, 
non-nuclear nations that might develop chemical or biological weapons. 
``We believe it continues to serve a vital security purpose for the 
NATO organization and should not be changed,'' Cohen said, standing 
next to Scharping at the news conference at the Defense Department. 
The public debate within Germany in recent days over nuclear strategy 
suggests new rifts in the government coalition between the Social 
Democrats and the Greens. In a coalition agreement reached last month, 
the two parties agreed that NATO should renounce the possible first 
use of nuclear weapons, a clear concession to the Greens. But it had 
been unclear to American officials whether Gerhard Schroeder, the 
Social Democrat who is the new chancellor, had accepted the declaration 
as an empty concession to the Greens or would in fact move to question 
one of the central tenets of NATO doctrine. Scharping, a Social Democrat 
on his first visit to Washington as defense minister, said that the 
new German government had no intention of creating a rift with NATO 
by acting unilaterally on the issue. ``NATO is the most successful 
alliance we have ever seen in history so the main goal of our government 
in Germany is to strengthen NATO and its cohesion and to make NATO 
able to face the challenges for the next century,'' he said. Still, 
he said that his government ``is following the vision of a nuclear-weapons 
free world'' and that ``the necessity to use them may be extremely 
remote as it is written down in the actual NATO strategy.''
