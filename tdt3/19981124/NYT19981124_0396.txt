Luba Elianoff, a Latvian-born little old linen lady whose bearing 
was a bit too regal, whose spirit was a bit too fiery and whose embroideries 
were a bit too elegant to be called that to her face, died on Nov. 
17 at her Manhattan apartment. She was 96 and had much preferred to 
be called the Queen of Linens. A full 50 inches tall in her prime, 
Mrs. Elianoff, who had shrunk somewhat by the time she retired at 
86, may not have had the stature of a queen, but during the more than 
four decades she spent designing and manufacturing delicately embroidered 
towels, sheets, pillowcases and the like, no one ever accused her 
of not charging queenly prices. Still, for a woman who catered to 
those who routinely paid several hundred dollars for a set of sheets, 
Mrs. Elianoff, who worked in a second-floor studio above what is now 
the Fairway fruit and vegetable market at Broadway and 75th Street, 
was remarkably democratic. It was she, after all, who claimed to have 
been the first to persuade the Swiss embroidery industry, which handled 
her production, to work in polyester rather than cotton, a high-maintenance 
material better suited to the dwindling number of households whose 
staffs included maids and laundresses. For all that, when it came 
to decorating sheets with borders of a range of intricate, imaginative 
designs, Mrs. Elianoff drew the line at substituting printed (shudder!) 
fabrics for stitching. The daughter of a prosperous Latvian businessman, 
Mrs. Elianoff, a Riga native whose maiden name was Levitt, learned 
to sew as a child, but her girlhood heart belonged to the theater. 
At 16, when the Russian empire was in the throes of collapse, she 
escaped military patrols by hiding in a hay cart and made her way 
to Moscow, where she studied drama under Stanislavsky and others. 
It was a sideline, as an English tutor, that changed her life twice 
over, leading her both to Martin Elianoff, a lawyer who became her 
husband, and to Armand Hammer, the American businessman who helped 
the couple immigrate to the Philippines in 1930. In Manila, she began 
managing and later bought a chic fashion boutique catering to the 
city's American and European elite. When Mrs. Elianoff began supplementing 
its line of fine imports with embroideries made of an indigenous pineapple 
fiber known as pina, her customers were captivated by her designs. 
The Philippine government was so delighted with her efforts to bolster 
the local economy that it awarded her a series of medals. With war 
clouds looming (and many of her Western clients being evacuated) Mrs. 
Elianoff brought her daughter, Anna Lou, to the United States in March 
1941 and she eventually became a citizen. After a brief reunion when 
the war was over, she and her husband separated but never divorced. 
He died in 1982. After working in a series of Manhattan linen shops, 
Mrs. Elianoff soon struck out on her own, using a sewing machine in 
her Riverside Drive apartment to embroider satin lingerie and hosiery 
cases for sale in local stores. It was not until full domestic textile 
production resumed in 1946 that Mrs. Elianoff expanded into sheets, 
towels, pillowcases and shower curtains, typically buying stock sheets 
at wholesale prices, replacing the standard border with lace and other 
elaborate embroidery and reselling them to stores like Saks Fifth 
Avenue and Lord &AMP; Taylor at what seemed to some exorbitant prices. 
As one store buyer once told her: ``That's not a price. It's a telephone 
number.'' Still, Mrs. Elianoff found such an enthusiastic market for 
her Luba Elianoff line of luxury linens that she soon had to move 
her business to her Broadway workroom, where a staff handled the sewing. 
In time, demand for her elegant work grew so strong that about 200 
stores carried her line, and she contracted out the manufacturing 
of borders to Swiss factories. Partly because Mrs. Elianoff was such 
a perfectionist that she did most of her design work in Switzerland, 
where she worked closely with production specialists, and partly because 
her local production staff used a special flat seam that made the 
attached borders seem like a natural extension of the mass-produced 
sheet, she was widely recognized as one of the finest designers of 
decorative linens. Always open to change, when Wamsutta began producing 
sheets in a variety of colors, Mrs. Elianoff responded enthusiastically, 
her once dainty designs blossoming into big, bold flowers and other 
colorful designs. As an American, Mrs. Elianoff began to see herself 
as more than the Queen of Linens. Recalling that as a teen-ager she 
had made a flag for a Zionist parade in Riga, she came to regard herself 
as the Betsy Ross of Zionism. She is survived by her daughter, Anna 
Lou Aldrich of Manhattan, five granddaughters and two great-grandsons.
