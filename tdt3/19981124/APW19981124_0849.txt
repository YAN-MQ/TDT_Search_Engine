Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will travel to India on Sunday 
for talks on relations and possibly extending a pact on military cooperation, 
the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday. Primakov will stay for 
three or four days, Interfax quoted Indian diplomatic sources in Moscow 
as saying. Boris Yeltsin had been scheduled to go to India for an 
official visit next month, but he postponed the trip last week and 
asked Primakov to go. The Kremlin insisted that Primakov wasn't going 
in place of Yeltsin and said the change had nothing to do with Yeltsin's 
health. The president is in the hospital recovering from pneumonia. 
Primakov and Indian officials may sign a new agreement on military 
and technical cooperation through 2010, Interfax said. The two countries 
have an agreement now that expires in 2000.
