With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
We will expect still windy and wet conditions for the pacific northwest. 
A frontal system moves across the Rockies as we head on into Wednesday. 
High pressure dominates the eastern seaboard but not for long. Then 
another storm system will pound the pacific northwest and British 
columbia coast with another round of heavy rain and wind. Temperature-wise, 
not bad. All the way from southern California into Texas, the central 
plains and into the southeast, mostly 60s and 70s. But 30s into the 
Great Lakes. Look for a high of just 5 in Fairbanks, Alaska. But 84 
expected in Hilo. Our extended forecast is calling for a frontal system 
to impact the midwest and the Great Lakes, as we go into Wednesday's 
weather picture. And then, by Thanksgiving day, it looks like it's 
going to be a soggy day for a parade in New York City. More showers 
for the pacific northwest. And then, into Friday, a temperature Spike 
across the south-central plains, 60s and 70s. For more weather information, 
log on to CNN.com.
