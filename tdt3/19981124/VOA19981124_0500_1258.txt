The battle for the Men's World number one tennis ranking, between 
American Pete Sampras and Marcella Reos of Chili, gets underway this 
week at the ATP tour championships in Hanover, Germany. Sampras is 
determined to finish up the year with a number-one ranking for the 
sixth year in a row. Reos, the man the U.S. magazine "Sports Illustrated," 
once described as the most hated man in tennis, stands in his way, 
just 33 points behind Sampras. Whichever player fares best of the 
tournament, will finish the season with the number-one ranking. The 
tournament gets under way today, and brings together the top eight 
players in the world. Sampras and Reos will be joined by American 
Andre Agassi, Spaniards, Alex Corech and Carlos Moiria, Carol Kutcher 
of Slovakia, Britain's Tim Hennman and Ufganiaca Philicoff of Russia.
