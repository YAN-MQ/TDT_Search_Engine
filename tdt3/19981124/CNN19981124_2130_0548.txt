The American red cross says it spent a record amount of money on natural 
disaster relief this year. The charity says $160 million was spent 
to cover the many hurricanes, tropical storms and floods that struck 
the United States. Most of it, $104 million, was used to help victims 
of hurricane georges in the Florida keys and gulf coast.
