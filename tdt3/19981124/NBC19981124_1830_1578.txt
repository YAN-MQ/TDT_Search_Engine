One of the major changes in American life is the delivery of mail 
and packages. There was a time when the post office was supreme. Then 
competing companies moved into the shipping lanes. So, who's the best 
as we approach these holidays? Here's NBC's Robert Hager. What happens 
once you seal the box and that holiday gift leaves your hands? Does 
it get there late? Get banged around? Make any difference whether 
it's FedEx, U.P.S., or the post office? To find out, the magazine 
"consumer reports" sent out 838 packages, same size, same weight. 
From all across the country to addresses hundreds or even thousands 
of miles away. The results, anything but merry for the post office. 
For promised one-day delivery -- If they don't deliver overnight, 
you can get your money back. But that won't help if the box doesn't 
get there overnight. As for cheaper, two-day service -- and when it 
comes to ordinary no-rush delivery, the study conducted this time 
last year, found both the post office and U.P.S. were late more than 
20% of the time. The post office says it'll do better this Christmas. 
We have made the changing in our infrastricture and we have added 
the people to make the service this year better. And the battle between 
the shipping giants isn't just fought on the delivery routes. The 
post office spends nearly a quarter billion dollars on ads touting 
its service, while FedEx claims the ads are misleading, and is suing. 
Caught in the middle, your packages, which get bounced around. "Consumer 
reports" actually packed sensors in each box to see how they were 
handled. Of delivery the sensors show that one out of every ten packages 
shipped by the post office and even more shipped by the others suffered 
the equivalent of this, a straight drop from seven feet. Even when 
fragile was plastered all over the boxes, it didn't help. Just as 
many got knocked around. And something else to cheer the mind as the 
holidays approach -- eight of the packages never arrived at all. Three 
from the post office and five from U.P.S. simply disappeared! Robert 
Hager, NBC news, Washington.
