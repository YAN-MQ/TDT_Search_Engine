Palestinians have taken a step toward independence with the opening 
of the gaza strip airport. Palestinian authority President Yasser 
Arafat and cabinet ministers greeted the first arriving passengers 
aboard an Egypt air flight. Israel will have some control over the 
airport. It will monitor arriving passengers and cargo, and it has 
the right to exclude anyone or anything it considers dangerous to 
Israel.
