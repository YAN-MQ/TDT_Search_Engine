British Officials met with representatives of 16 Iraqi opposition 
groups in London, Monday, urging unity against Saddam Hussein. VOA's 
Kyle King reports, a U.S. representative may join the meeting today 
to spell out what material support a unified Iraqi opposition might 
expect. State Department officials say Assistant Secretary of State, 
Martin Indeck is likely to meet again with Iraqi opposition leaders 
who have been holding talks with British officials in London. Mr. 
Indeck, who is visiting Paris to discuss administration efforts, held 
an earlier round of talks with Iraqi opposition groups in Washington, 
last week. Officials say the talks are part of a three-part administration 
effort, that will include the naming of a new state department coordinator 
for Iraq. State Department spokesman, James Rubin, says the administration 
is also stepping up efforts to develop evidence that could be used 
if an Iraqi war-crimes tribunal is ever created. I think it's fair 
to say we're giving a greater push to the idea of developing the strongest 
possible evidence based in the case of war crimes that the Iraqi regime 
committed. The U.S. Congress has put aside $2 million for that effort, 
while $97 million has been designated to help Iraqi opposition groups. 
Officials say the goal is to bring about a government that will bring 
Iraq back into the community of nations. Kyle King, VOA News, at the 
State Department.
