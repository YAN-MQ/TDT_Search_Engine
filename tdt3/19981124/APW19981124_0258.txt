Top officials of Europe's soccer associations were meeting Tuesday 
to discuss a revamped structure for UEFA's club competitions. Last 
month, representatives of major teams agreed not to join a breakaway 
Super League after the European governing body proposed changing its 
Champions League, offering teams more money. UEFA promised to expand 
next season's Champions' League from 24 teams to 32 clubs, playing 
in eight groups of four teams in the first stage. It also proposed 
to merge the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup into one competition, called 
the UEFA Cup. Last week in Madrid, 14 clubs endorsed the plan and 
urged UEFA to implement the new format starting next season. Final 
details of the new structure have yet to be resolved. The 17 dates 
needed to stage the new-look competition in an already tight season 
schedule are proving problematic. ``Some leagues have 20 teams so 
it will be difficult for them,'' UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner 
said earlier this month. ``We'll have to study the individual situation 
in each country.'' UEFA is also trying to come up with a ranking system 
which will satisfy everyone. Aigner said UEFA is looking to figure 
in group match results, results in the knockout matches, the nation's 
coefficient and individual club coefficients. Europe's top clubs have 
demanded 50 percent of any revenue generated by the revamped Champions 
League. Tuesday's special conference in Geneva, to which the presidents 
of UEFA's 51 member associations have been invited, will touch on 
other areas ``including European Union matters,'' UEFA says. The body 
last week expressed concern that soccer ``be treated in accordance 
with its specific character by EU institutions.''
