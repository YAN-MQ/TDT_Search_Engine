Then, there is the industry colossus, Microsoft, which has a business 
alliance with NBC. Since all of the experts are saying this new company 
is now in the best position to take on Microsoft, Microsoft's lawyers 
were quick to say this proves there is no monopoly and the federal 
government should drop its antitrust suit. Not surprisingly, the government 
has another point of view. NBC's Pete Williams tonight. For Microsoft 
lawyers, the merger is the first big break in the federal antitrust 
trial. They say the justice department should now drop the lawsuit 
and let competition in the software industry police the market instead. 
The company says it's just like 25 years ago, when market changes 
eroded the government's antitrust case against computer giant IBM. 
This deal shows that the government has always been, and will always 
be, in a dynamic, innovative industry like ours, five steps behind 
the industry. But the government says the merger proves just the opposite 
-- that Microsoft's marketing practices are unfair, like insisting 
on exclusive deals with computermakers smothering Netscape, reducing 
it to a Takeover target. Because of the blanket that Microsoft was 
able to put over it, it was simply not able to continue its pattern 
of innovation and not able to continue to give consumers the choice. 
Legal experts say they doubt the merger will hand Microsoft a Court 
victory, noting that the judge in the trial is not Microsoft friendly 
and has described company CEO Bill Gates as "unresponsive" in his 
videotaped testimony. One excerpt shows Gates having trouble remembering 
details about one of his own senior officers. Systems? Systems? Uh-huh. 
Did he have a title that went with that? Senior vice president, systems. 
But antitrust experts say the Netscape/AOL deal means even if the 
judge rules against Microsoft, he won't be harsh. This merger increases 
the likelihood that any punishment he will impose will be relatively 
mild, that he will not insist on the breakup of the company or any 
forced sharing of its intellectual property with its competitors. 
And antitrust scholars say the trial actually made the merger possible, 
putting Microsoft in the penalty box while its competitors got bolder.
