Tomorrow on this broadcast we'll listen to much more of them with 
Doris kearns Goodwin. And history buffs will want to see this, coming 
tonight on MSNBC. Here's Jane pauley. Tonight on "time and again," 
the children of Camelot -- John and coorl Kennedy then and now. It's 
a week of -- Caroline Kennedy then and now. It's a week of milestones 
for the Kennedys both marking the 35th anniversary of their father's 
death. We'll hear from them and get a glimpse of their childhood in 
the White House. The children of Jack and Jackie coming next on "time 
and again." "Time and again" at 10:00 eastern and pacific on MSNBC. 
And when we come back a look at tomorrow's headlines and we'll tell 
you why the NBA walk out may affect you the next time you buy sneakers. 
John knew everything. We'll miss his knowledge. John wrote that consolidated 
contract. He didn't even tell us where he put it. Now they're really 
consumed with grief. If only they knew John scanned all of his documents... 
into the Xerox document center. He made them digital and put every 
last one of them on the company website. I wonder what John would 
do in this situation. He'd check your website to see if the Xerox 
document center... scanned in the consolidated contract. Hey, I just 
had a thought. Oh, there's a good place to start. You don't think 
John scanned the contract into the, uh, the-- the Xerox document center. 
Xerox document center, do you? John was smart, but he wasn't that 
smart. Ooohhh! I don't think John liked that.
