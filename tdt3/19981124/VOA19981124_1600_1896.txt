The United Nations Security Council has extended the oil-for-food 
program which allows Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil to buy humanitarian 
goods. All 15 council members voted in favor of extending the program 
another six months. The Security Council vote came just before members 
were to take up a dispute between Iraq and Chief U.N. Weapons Inspector
