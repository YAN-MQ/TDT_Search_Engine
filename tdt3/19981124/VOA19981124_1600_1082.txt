It's time now for sports with VOA's Steve Shine. Thank you very much, 
Tony. Tim Henman of Britain has upset world number two Marcelo Rios 
of Chile in straight sets at the season-ending ATP championships in 
Hanover, Germany. John Meyers has the details. John. Yes. This really 
was the biggest win of Tim Henman's career. He hadn't beaten Rios 
before. He had two ranking tournament wins this year and also reached 
the semis at Wimbledon, but this was big time and he absolutely wiped 
the floor with the world number two. Afterwards, Rios said he'd been 
suffering from a back strain, but, to be honest, Tim Henman's serve 
was absolutely pinpoint every time, and he thoroughly deserved that 
sudden fight 6-1 victory. It's been a good day for Pistol Pete Sampras 
all around because the defeat of Rios really boosts his chances of 
ending the season as world number one for a record sixth consecutive 
year. He completed a comfortable 6-2, 6-4 victory over the man he 
beat in last year's final, Yevgeny Kafelnikov. The other game today 
also in Pete Sampras' group saw Carlos Moya cruising to a 2 sets-to-1 
win over the Slovak Karol Kucera. So looking ahead tomorrow, the other 
American, "Angry" Andre Agassi in action against Alex Corretja. Then 
it's Pete Sampras in action again against Carlos Moya, and the third 
game on the second day here, Karol Kucera takes on Yevgeny Kafelnikov. 
John Meyers for VOA Sports in Hanover, Germany. Thank you very much 
for that report, John.
