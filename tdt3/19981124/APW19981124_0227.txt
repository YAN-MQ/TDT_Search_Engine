An Australian woman was hospitalized after collapsing at Bahrain's 
international airport when one of some 20 packets of heroin she had 
swallowed burst in her stomach, the Gulf Daily News reported Tuesday. 
Najwa Mustafa, 42, who is of Lebanese origin, was traveling to Australia 
from Beirut via Bahrain when she collapsed and was rushed to a hospital 
with severe symptoms of narcotics overdose, the English-language paper 
said. Nurses alerted police after finding the woman had secreted 40 
packets of heroin in her stomach and other body cavities, the paper 
said. She also had 15 packets wrapped up in a bun of her hair. Mustafa, 
who collapsed Saturday, was still in the hospital's intensive care 
unit Monday night, the newspaper added. Hospital authorities could 
not be reached for comment.
