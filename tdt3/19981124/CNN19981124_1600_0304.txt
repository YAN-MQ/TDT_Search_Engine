Iraqi leaders are appealing to other Arab nations to help lift U.N. 
sanctions. Front page editorials in state-run papers are calling for 
neighboring countries to assist Iraq in thwarting what they call British-American 
plots. Meanwhile, requests by U.N. weapons inspectors for documents 
from the Iraqi government are still being denied. Iraqi leaders contend 
they've already handed over all relevant documents and will continue 
to cooperate with inspectors.
