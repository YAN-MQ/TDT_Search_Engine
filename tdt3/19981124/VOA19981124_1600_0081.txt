The United Nations Security Council has extended the oil-for-food 
program which allows Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil to buy humanitarian 
goods. All 15 members voted in favor of extending the program another 
six months. Iraq is allowed to sell more than $5 billion worth of 
oil in that time, but it had asked for just a two-month extension, 
not wanting to suggest the U.N. economic sanctions might continue 
any longer than that.
