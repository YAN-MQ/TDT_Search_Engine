The New England Patriots defeated the Miami Dolphins 26-23 in an exciting 
Monday night National Football League match up of AFC division rivals. 
New England pulled out the victory with under a minute left in the 
game when quarterback Drew Bledsoe connected on a 25-yeard-touchdown 
pass to Sean Jefferson. Bledsoe set up the touchdown by twice converting 
fourth downs on the final drive. Bledsoe threw for another score earlier, 
and finished with 423 yards passing. New England improves to 6-5. 
The Dolphins slipped to 7-4, and a three-way tie for first with the 
New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.
