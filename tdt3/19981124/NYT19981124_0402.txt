NEW YORK _ J.C. Penney Co., the Texas-based retailer, has agreed to 
buy Genovese Drug Stores Inc., a leading chain in the metropolitan 
region, for $492 million in stock and debt, the two companies announced 
Tuesday. Industry analysts saw the agreement as a further sign that 
huge pharmacy chains are in a better position to survive the challenges 
posed by managed care, which has steadily been reducing the amount 
it reimburses pharmacies for filling prescriptions. One of only two 
family-controlled drugstore chains in the country _ the other is Longs 
Drugs, which operates in six Western states _ Genovese was founded 
in 1924, when Joseph Genovese opened his first store in Astoria, N.Y. 
With headquarters in Melville, N.Y., Genovese has 141 stores in New 
York, New Jersey and Connecticut and employs 5,000 people. Sales for 
the fiscal year ending on Jan. 30, 1999, are projected to reach $800 
million. Genovese is dwarfed by the Eckerd chain, which was acquired 
by J.C. Penney in 1997. Eckerd is the third-largest drugstore chain 
in the nation, after CVS Pharmacy Inc., and the Rite Aid Corp. Eckerd, 
which has stores in 20 states, has continued to expand, and now has 
2,800 stores and sales of $11 billion. The Genovese stores will be 
renamed Eckerd during a one-year transition. Given recent consolidation 
trends, the proposed acquisition of Genovese _ which is subject to 
the approval of shareholders and regulators _ came as no surprise 
to Wall Street. Pharmacies make less and less of their profit by filling 
prescriptions and have to rely on sales of other products to make 
money. To cut labor costs, they are expected to rely increasingly 
on automation for such tasks as counting pills. The investment that 
Genovese would have needed to make in technology to compete effectively 
was considered prohibitive for a company of its size. Eric Bosshard, 
an analyst at Midwest Research of Cleveland, said it was inevitable 
that Genovese would be swallowed up by a larger company. ``Genovese 
as a part of Eckerd has a greater ability to succeed over the long 
term _ as a national company rather than a regional company,'' he 
said. Duncan Muir, a spokesman for J.C. Penney at its headquarters 
in Plano, Texas, said it was too early to say how many employees would 
lose their jobs. Genovese's headquarters in Melville on Long Island, 
where about 200 people are employed, was expected to close after a 
year, he said. But those lost jobs are expected to be offset by new 
positions as Eckerd adds stores. The proposed deal involves an exchange 
of $432 million in stock. Genovese shareholders would receive J.C. 
Penney stock valued at $30 for each share of Genovese common stock 
they own. The exchange ratio would be determined by the average trading 
value of J.C. Penney common stock in 10 of the 20 days prior to closing. 
J.C. Penney also agreed to assume $60 million in Genovese debt.
