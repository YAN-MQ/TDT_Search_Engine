An Egyptian museum dedicated to the country's former kings and leaders 
has opened in Cairo. The artifacts include weapons, clothing and many 
treasures acquired by the rulers or given to them as state gifts. 
The director of the museum hopes the exhibit becomes as popular as 
Egypt's other historically significant tourist attractions.
