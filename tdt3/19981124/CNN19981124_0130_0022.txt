"CNN Headline News." I'm David Goodnow. Those stories in a moment, 
but first -- one more legal chapter is over for whitewater figure 
Susan McDougal. On Monday, a jury acquitted her on all counts in her 
embezzlement trial in california. Charles Feldman looks at what else 
is ahead. The trial dragged on for just over 11 weeks. The jurors 
were out only four days before returning the verdict. We the jury 
in the above-entitled action find the defendant, Susan mcDougal, not 
guilty of the crime of grand theft of personal property. The jury 
went on to acquit Susan McDougal on all counts, finding her not guilty 
of embezzling some $50,000 from conductor zubin mehta and his wife 
by forging checks and using Mrs. mehta's bank access card without 
her approval. McDougal was also found not guilty of failing to pay 
state income taxes. I'm very grateful to this jury. I got an intelligent, 
thoughtful jury, and I am grateful to them and to God today that I 
stand here an innocent person. It was another case, unrelated to this 
one, that brought Susan mcDougal to national attention. She spent 
18 months in jail for refusing to testify about her friend's alleged 
involvement in the so-called Whitewater land deal. Her friend is President 
Clinton. But before all this, the Whitewater figure was already in 
hot water with the mehtas. McDougal worked for them from 1989 to 1992, 
as a bookkeeper and personal assistant. Although the charges in California 
were filed years ago, McDougal claimed prosecutors here were working 
in concert with independent counsel Ken Starr to force her cooperation 
in the Whitewater affair. McDougal's problems with the law are not 
over by a long shot. Nor, her association with Whitewater. She faces 
prosecution in Arkansas for refusing to testify in that case. Charles 
Feldman, CNN, Los Angeles.
