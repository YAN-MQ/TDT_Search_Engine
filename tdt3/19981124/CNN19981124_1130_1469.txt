Between touring, promoting and recording, superstar Celine Dion is 
finding time for her first special on American network television. 
Sherri Sylvester takes a look. Near far wherever you are I believe 
that the heart does go on Special times for Celine Dion include two 
Oscar nights, three grammy awards and sales of 60 million albums. 
She is constantly touring, promoting and recording. And so it happens 
that her new holiday offering has a dual purpose, showing fans her 
personal side and bringing Dion the rare chance to see her own family. 
On and on They are the people that I love the most, and I am away 
from them most of the time. So I wanted them to be on my Christmas 
album. I wanted them to be on my Christmas special. So you will see 
my family. You will see the house where I grew up, the 16 dions in 
charlemagne, this little town. Feliz navidad feliz navidad Aptly titled 
"these are special times," Dion's album and first U.S. TV special 
bring mom, dad and her 13 siblings together. When I started to entertain 
my family, I was 5 years old. That I remember very much. They used 
to put me on the kitchen -- the table in the kitchen. The fairy tale, 
as she calls it, began when a 12-year-old Dion recorded a song heard 
by her now husband and manager Rene. I mean, it's difficult because 
-- it's a very, very simple song, but it's the first song that my 
mom wrote. For me, my mom, writing a song was like, "how can she do 
that?" These days, she is singing with Italy's Andrea bocelli, who 
landed on her holiday album and special after meeting her in a restaurant. 
Dion's duet with Rosie O'Donnell, she calls, music between friends. 
He will bring us goodness and light Despite the cynicism of some critics, 
Dion's songs have inspired the newly wed, the critically ill and millions 
in between. The power of love Sherri Sylvester, "CNN Entertainment 
News," Los Angeles.
