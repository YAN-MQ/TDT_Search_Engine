Mangu and music from the Dominican Republic by way of New York and 
Miami put the wraps on this edition of the program. Don't forget we're 
online at www.theworld.org. In Boston, I'm Lisa Mullins. Join us again 
tomorrow for another spin of The World. The World is a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, Public Radio International and WGBH Boston 
and is made possible in part by the PRI Program Fund, whose contributors 
include the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation and the Teresa and H. John Heinz III Foundation.
