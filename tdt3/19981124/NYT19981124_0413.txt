Gloria Denard is a jazz singer, so she knows how to improvise. Thirty-one 
years ago she relied more on ingenuity than income to start Manna 
House Workshops, an East Harlem school dedicated to jazz and dance. 
Grants helped her buy a five-story building on East 106th Street, 
where the school occupies the first two floors and the rest are rented 
to tenants. One was Jason Adams, who moved there in 1989. Last year, 
he became the building's handyman, giving new meaning to that job 
title. He was a big brother to the school's students and took them 
to movies or on trips to the park. He bought flowers for the ladies 
in the building and tucked Christmas cards under everyone's door. 
Using his own money, he even paid the neighborhood youths who helped 
him clean the building. Adams was killed last month in his apartment, 
police said, by two young men who stole his computer and video game 
system and some cash. He was stabbed more than 50 times. His death 
has Ms. DeNard improvising again, this time as building custodian. 
Unable to afford a replacement, she begins her days checking the halls 
for litter, putting out garbage bags and tending the boiler. Her new 
tasks sap her time and energy, since she is already busy writing grant 
proposals, promoting recitals and handling other school activities. 
A few volunteers help out, but she has learned that many are jittery 
about venturing to the neighborhood because of fears about crime. 
That leaves Ms. DeNard in a bind: the negative perceptions she hoped 
to fight with the transforming power of music have scared off the 
very people who could help her. ``I started Manna House to show we 
had a culture of our own, so people would value what we had to offer,'' 
Ms. DeNard said. ``We've been made to feel we're inferior, but the 
one thing I want to say is we are beautiful people with a creative 
spirit who can create anything we choose. But I can't create volunteers.'' 
Although as the handyman he got a break on his rent, Adams did more 
in return. Friends and neighbors remembered him as always smiling 
and willing to help, helping carry packages, looking after the younger 
students or lending an artistic touch to the classroom where neighborhood 
people gathered on Saturday nights for jukebox dances. ``He designed 
all the Christmas decorations,'' Ms. DeNard said. ``He designed a 
tree from lights that he put up on the wall. Just like you see downtown 
in the department stores.'' Whenever people passed by the building 
they waved to Adams. He was in front early each day to sweep away 
the scattered remains of cigars that had been gutted and stuffed with 
marijuana the night before by the get-high crowd right in front of 
the signs that read ``Say No to Drugs'' and ``No Trespassing.'' Perhaps 
he was too trusting, but he refused to think the neighborhood was 
beyond hope. He told Marjorie Roberson, Ms. DeNard's assistant, that 
everyone could change for the better. ``I asked him why he spent so 
much time with young kids,'' Ms. Roberson said. ``He said he wanted 
to keep them off the street, since they were not working and had time 
on their hands.'' Perhaps the sight of some of those youths on the 
street kept volunteers away. They would not have seen the countless 
young people who have learned jazz and dance at the school and have 
gone on to appear on stage, in movies or in concert with musicians 
like Miles Davis or Lena Horne. Some people do come by, but make a 
polite excuse and never come back. It has turned Ms. DeNard into a 
volunteer herself, since she pays herself a monthly stipend of only 
$150 so that her teaching staff won't have to take a pay cut. ``People 
don't express how they really feel,'' Ms. DeNard said. ``Who knows 
how many people have stayed away from working here because of what 
happened?'' Some people have suggested she move her school to someplace 
less threatening, but Ms. DeNard refuses even to consider a move that 
would be tantamount to admitting defeat. Instead, she is trying to 
find a way to finish some of the work Adams left undone: hallways 
that need painting, walls that need to be stripped, mailboxes that 
have to be replaced. One task remains. In a few days she will put 
a plaque in the lobby in honor of Adams, a friend, neighbor and employee 
who came and never left. She plans to put a spotlight on it, so people 
can see it from the street when they walk by. Maybe a few will stop.
