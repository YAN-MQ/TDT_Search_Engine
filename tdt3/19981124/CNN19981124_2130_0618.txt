Some people are thinking about more than just their personal computers 
when it comes to the year 2000 computer problem. They're thinking 
about their finances, too. Rick Lockridge has more in this edition 
of "tech trends." How much cash do people carry? Usually I get out 
$10 or $20, but nothing more. How much money do you get out? $25. 
I got out $20. With so little cash in hand, people rely on plastic 
-- credit cards and debit cards -- all supported by vast computer 
networks. And it follows that if people are worried that the year 
2000 computer problem will cause those networks to crash, they may 
try to squirrel away lots of extra cash. So the federal reserve has 
ordered an extra $50 billion in new currency, enough for every American 
family to withdraw an extra $500 if they want it. The fed says it 
didn't want to contribute to any Y2K panic but says it felt it had 
to order the money from the treasury just in case people wanted to 
get their hands on it. But U.S. banks are doing all they can to convince 
consumers to leave their money where it is. The safest place for your 
money is in a bank. It's the best place for it. The banks reconcile 
their accounts every day. And if there are little, small glitches 
that may occur, you know that the bank will fix it for you. Credit 
unions, with their 70 million-plus members, aren't none too happy 
about the Y2K hype either. A press report such as the one you're preparing 
may cause some consumers to get nervous. But if everybody behaves 
as they should behave, and rationally, there should be no extreme 
liquidity crunch. Meaning no run on the banks. But even as banking 
officials do all they can to avert a panic, they admit they are expecting 
the old ATMs to get hit pretty hard in the weeks leading up to Y2K 
day. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Washington.
