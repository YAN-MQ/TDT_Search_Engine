``Very Bad Things,'' written and directed by the actor Peter Berg, 
is about as funny as the character who winds up a double amputee in 
its closing scene. And that's the way Berg seems to want it. Inspired 
by the insight that packs of guys visiting Las Vegas can behave stupidly, 
Berg creates dull middle-class buddies in the throes of a bachelor 
party. Then he watches a little bitty mishap (the stripper's violent 
death) escalate into big trouble. It's hard to know which is more 
clever, the stripper's bare corpse in stiletto boots (one of the camera's 
favorite reference points) or the sequence in which her hacked-up 
body parts are wrapped in plastic and buried in a desert grave. Humorous 
slashings and car accidents constitute similar high points in a film 
that is glaringly short on ``Scream''-style self-mockery to match 
its dopey mayhem. This is not to say that Berg's screenplay doesn't 
have black comic possibilities as it wreaks increasing havoc among 
characters obsessed with the wedding plans of Kyle (Jon Favreau) and 
Laura (Cameron Diaz). Really, there's no reason not to share the script's 
eagerness to see most of these smug or witless individuals wind up 
dead. But Berg's listless direction brings the film so little point 
of view that it doesn't much matter who lives or dies. There's not 
even much shock value to the story itself, a kind of Dockers-clad 
``Lord of the Flies.'' Once the five men on the Vegas spree wind up 
with blood all over their hotel bathroom, ``Very Bad Things'' mirthfully 
watches things get worse. It turns out that one of these friends is 
a crazed, boastful loose cannon, and that Christian Slater is not 
exactly miscast in this role. (He is also one of the film's executive 
producers.) Once his character has proclaimed himself the group's 
``success coach'' and ordered a cover-up of their crimes, the others 
(Daniel Stern, Jeremy Piven and the jittery, near-silent Leland Orser) 
show signs of strain. The family man ( Stern) is even uncool enough 
to worry whether the security guard they've killed had any children 
and to suggest prayers for the dead. When the others aren't ridiculing 
him for this, they're whining, feeling sorry for themselves and getting 
into fatal mishaps. Forget about Ms. Diaz, because the movie does. 
Funny as she was in the much sharper-edged black comedy ``There's 
Something About Mary,'' she spends her time here as a ninny, worrying 
about wedding plans and eventually bashing the best man with a coat 
stand when he puts the wedding's perfection in jeopardy. Letting even 
Ms. Diaz turn ugly is certainly a neat trick, but Berg manages it 
all too well. PRODUCTION NOTES ``VERY BAD THINGS'' Rating: ``Very
