Dr. Vladimir P. Demikhov, a Russian surgeon whose pioneering work 
in performing organ transplants on dogs set the stage for similar 
operations on humans in later years, died Nov. 22. He was 82 and lived 
in a small apartment on Moscow's outskirts. The Russian Itar-Tass 
news agency, which reported his death, said it came after a long illness. 
But the agency did not report what caused his death or where he died. 
Itar-Tass also said that Demikhov was the first to perform a heart 
transplant on a dog, in 1946. The agency reported that the dog, which 
kept its old heart and the new one, survived for five months after 
the surgery. In 1947, the agency said, Demikhov carried out the first 
animal lung transplant, which was also performed on a dog; and in 
1952 he conducted the first coronary bypass on an animal, another 
dog. Asked about Itar-Tass' account, Dr. Dennis Franco, a Yale Medical 
School professor of surgery who does organ transplants, said that 
he would not dispute that Demikhov was the first to do these operations, 
although skimpy record-keeping makes it hard to document. Opinions 
among American experts differ as to the importance of Demikhov's work 
in the history of organ-transplant surgery. Dr. John Conte, the director 
of heart and lung transplantation at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 
Baltimore, said Tuesday : ``In the history of heart and lung transplantation 
he's very well known; he did some of the seminal work.'' He added, 
``Everybody who performs heart and lung transplantations is to a certain 
extent'' indebted to Demikhov. Conte, who has performed about about 
200 heart and lung transplantations on humans, said that, after Dr. 
Alexis Carrel, an American surgeon and experimental biologist who 
won a 1912 Nobel Prize for his work in organ transplantation and in 
other fields, Demikhov ``probably had the biggest early impact on 
the field of heart and lung transplantation, because during the '40s 
and '50s he did hundreds and hundreds of experiments on dogs that 
showed different techniques of how to actually do heart and lung transplants. 
The guy clearly had to have a very creative mind.'' Franco said that 
Demikhov's work was very significant in leading to transplants of 
hearts and lungs in humans in later years, because the work demonstrated 
that the operations could be performed. But Franco emphasized that 
the subsequent history of organ transplants was protracted and complex. 
He said, ``I'm sure that anyone who was interested in transplantation 
at the time was aware of Demikhov's work and of the work of other 
pioneers in the field.'' Indeed, Franco said, Dr. Norman Shumway of 
Stanford University and Dr. Richard Lower of the Medical College of 
Virginia ``did a lot of heart transplants in dogs in the late '50s 
and early '60s.'' ``And after they did their laboratory work, that 
geared everybody up to performing heart transplants in humans,'' Franco 
went on, and ``Christiaan Barnard was the first surgeon to do a human 
heart transplant,'' in South Africa in 1967. ``Unfortunately, the 
patient didn't do very well because we didn't have the immunosuppression'' 
that was necessary, Franco said, and then ``in the late 1970s cyclosporine 
became available.'' Cyclosporine prevents the rejection of a transplanted 
organ by the body of the recipient. ``So now,'' Franco continued, 
``once we had that drug, then people began to look at transplanting 
the heart and the lungs in humans, and Dr. Bruce Reitz and Dr. Shumway 
performed the first human heart-lung transplant, at Stanford'' in 
the early 1980s. Thus, Franco said, almost 40 years passed after Demikhov's 
early work in animal transplants before that operation was performed 
clinically on humans. And yet, despite that time lag, he said, Demikhov's 
achievement was ``an important stepping-stone'' toward organ transplants 
in humans. Dr. Richard White, a professor of neurosurgery at Case 
Western Reserve University in Cleveland said of Demikhov, ``He was 
a fascinating man, an amazing experimental surgeon; he transplanted, 
using dogs almost exclusively, almost every organ you could possible 
think of.'' Demikhov is said to have been born in Moscow and to have 
attended the First Medical Institute, a hospital and medical school 
in Moscow. It was after World War II that he undertook his experimental 
work, at the Vishnevsky Surgical Institute of the Academy of Medical 
Sciences of the Soviet Union. Itar-Tass reported that Soviet medical 
leaders had regarded his experiments as only ``tricks.'' But earlier 
this year, he was awarded a high Russian honor, the Order for Services 
for the Fatherland, by a presidential decree. Late in his life, the 
news agency said, he was the director of the Russian Health Ministry's 
Republican Center for Human Reproduction. Demikhov's wife, Liya, died 
earlier this year. No further information on survivors was immediately 
available.
