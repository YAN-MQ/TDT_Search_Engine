Hundreds of international observers are arriving at Serbia's Kosovo 
province, to monitor the shaky cease-fire between Serbian security 
forces and the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. But first, the observers 
will be going to school. Philip Smucker reports from a Verifier's 
Training School in Kosovo. International monitors will have just five 
days of training before taking on the dangerous job of monitoring 
Kosovo's guerrilla conflict. A school for monitors is being set up 
on Brezavitian mountain. The school, run by the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, will begin, on Tuesday, to teach 
the unarmed monitors how to work with the warring sides in Kosovo. 
The monitors, or verifiers, will learn how to deal with crisis situations. 
One such potential danger is the possibility of being taken hostage 
by the Serb forces, or the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation 
Army. The school's director, Mario Rejeli, says each hostage situation 
calls for a different reaction. I must check with my instructors. 
They are able to manage the situation in particular. There's not actually 
an answer valued for all situations. This school's instructors with 
experience in Bosnia will tell the pupil-verifiers not to over-react 
to any threat from either the Serbs or the Albanians. Italian police 
inspector, David Diavani, said the main thing is not to get excited 
and talk too much. Well, mainly, the main part of about how to behave, 
is not to react. Just stay very, very calm, very, very quiet. Do not 
over-react. Do not talk to these people. Listen to them, but do not 
do anything to agree or disagree with them. Just listen to them. Make 
the point, "Yes, I do understand you have a problem. But, I have not 
the power to solve your problem." Tell them this, and wait. Because 
there will be somebody that will take care about the problem. The 
verifiers also will be taught how to mediate between the Serbs and 
Albanians in Kosovo. Their task is to keep the violence to a minimum 
and to help prepare Kosovo for elections in another nine months. Philip 
Smucker, for VOA News, on Brezavitsen Mountain.
