Francesco and Marta are one of those hip couples: young, busy, fashionable 
and good-looking. They live in Rome in a great apartment with a terrace, 
work together as decorators and don't seem particularly unhappy, but 
maybe they are. Francesco (Alessandro Gassman) is the protagonist 
of ``Steam: The Turkish Bath'' (``Hamam: Il Bagno Turco''), Ferzan 
Ozpetek's seductive new film, an Italian-Turkish-Spanish production 
set in Istanbul and Rome. Francesco has inherited a building in Istanbul 
from an aunt he didn't really know, and neither he nor Marta (Francesca 
d'Aloja) wants to be bothered. But it's HIS relative, so he sets out 
for Turkey, where he plans to sell the building quickly and get back 
home. What he doesn't count on is falling in love, not so much with 
a person as with a city. Early in his trip, Francesco meets a frail, 
elderly man on the street and helps him to a nearby hamam, or Turkish 
bath. There is something about the atmosphere there, with many centuries 
of luxury and decadence in the air. He soon learns that the building 
his aunt has left him is, in fact, a hamam, albeit a very run-down 
one. Then he discovers that the woman who wants to buy the hamam from 
him is buying up all the property in the neighborhood to build a huge 
trade center, and his decision is made (a very unfortunate one, it 
turns out). He won't sell. He'll stay and restore the hamam to its 
former glory. It doesn't hurt that the family that his aunt lived 
with is the warmest group of parents and children to sit around a 
dinner table since ``The Waltons'' went off the air. They ply him 
with food and affection. A beautiful daughter, Fusun (Basak Koklukaya), 
and an equally beautiful son, Mehmet (Mehmet Gunsur), give Francesco 
equally long, admiring looks; Mehmet invites him to visit a hamam 
with him. A relationship may be developing. Everyone helps in the 
renovations. Meanwhile, Francesco takes long walks along the ancient, 
winding streets and in the harbor. And he reads his aunt's old letters, 
describing her growing love for Istanbul (``Here, things flow more 
slowly and soft'') and her emotional convictions (``One can be happy 
in this life, Giuliana; one must''). What seemed a noisy, dirty city, 
Francesco now sees, is an almost magical one surrounded by sapphire-blue 
waters. Then Marta arrives, seemingly just to see her husband after 
all these weeks but with a hidden agenda. ``Steam'' ends with a completely 
unexpected death, but it doesn't end unhappily. The film is a love 
letter to the quiet joy of finding one's place in the world. It even 
promotes the lovely illusion that finding that place can be a matter 
of mere geography. PRODUCTION NOTES: `STEAM: The Turkish Bath' Directed
