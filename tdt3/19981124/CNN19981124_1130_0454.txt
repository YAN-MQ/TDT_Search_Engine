I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
It's going to be a warm day today over most of the U.S., even some 
60s through the plains. 80s in the southwest and 70s and 80s are likely 
all along the gulf coast. Few 30s likely through the northern Great 
Lakes and parts of the Rockies. Forecast later today on in through 
the busy travel day on Wednesday, we'll find wet weather continuing 
in the pacific northwest as yet another storm system moves onshore. 
In the east, high pressure and, for the most part, dry weather. By 
late tomorrow, showers continue along that frontal system through 
the Great Lakes. Pretty mild temperatures though, so most of the precipitation 
will be in the form of rain. A look now at the extended forecast -- 
on Thanksgiving day, rain in the northeast. Some snow lingers through 
eastern Canada and extreme northern sections of the Great Lakes. Showers 
are likely in Florida, and rain and windy conditions continue in the 
pacific northwest. Friday, more wet weather from San Francisco through 
Seattle and Portland. Just a few lingering flurries during the morning 
hours mainly on Friday in portions of northern New England. And by 
Saturday, it's dry in the east with wet weather continuing in much 
of the west. For more weather information, log into CNN.com.
