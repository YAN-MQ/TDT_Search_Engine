Iraqi leaders are appealing to other Arab nations to help lift U.N. 
sanctions. Front page editorials in state-run papers are calling for 
neighboring countries to assist Iraq in thwarting what they call British-American 
plots. Meanwhile, requests by U.N. weapons inspectors for paperwork 
from the Iraqi government are still being denied. Chief inspector 
Richard Butler is asking Iraq to provide additional information about 
the manufacture of deadly weapons. Iraqi leaders contend they've already 
handed over all relevant documents and will continue to cooperate 
with inspectors.
