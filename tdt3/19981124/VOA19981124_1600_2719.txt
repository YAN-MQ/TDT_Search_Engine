More than one in four Americans tried an alternative medical treatment 
last year. A national survey by Harvard Medical School researchers 
asked people about 16 forms of therapy, ranging from herbal medicines 
and mega vitamins to spinal manipulation and spiritual healing. They 
found that women are more likely than men to turn to alternative healing 
and that 50 percent of the so-called baby boomers, people between 
the ages of 35 and 49, reported using some form of alternative medicine. 
The National Institutes of Health has expanded its National Center 
for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and is funding extensive 
clinical trials to evaluate alternative therapies. Traditional doctors 
have been trained to accept only those therapies for which there's 
a scientific basis. Alternative healers have been more likely to rely 
on observation and experience in the absence of clinical proof. NIH 
Associate Director for Disease Prevention Dr. William Harlan says 
alternative practitioners are beginning to accept testing, a change 
he says he welcomes.
