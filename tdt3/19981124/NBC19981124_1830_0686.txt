When we come back -- NBC news "in depth." Alarming new information 
tonight about America's schoolchildren and why they're coming up short 
in global competition. Sorry I'm late. I was at my doctor and-- oh, 
did you ask her about the things we've been reading about menopause? 
I did. She said... it's important to consider menopause... and the 
consequences of its associated estrogen loss. You mean, like hot flashes? 
Hot flashes and night sweats. But other things too. Like vaginal dryness. 
It can interfere with intimacy. And osteoporosis. I know that menopause... 
increases our risk for fractures. Dr. Hartman also said... studies 
show that menopause contributes to heart disease in women. Additional 
ongoing studies are investigating... the connection between menopause 
and Alzheimer's disease, colon cancer, blindness and tooth loss. I 
had no idea. My doctor and I decided... to stick with the program 
we've agreed on for years. I should speak to my doctor. When considering 
menopause, consider the entire body of evidence. Speak to your doctor 
about what you can do... to help protect your health during and after 
menopause.
