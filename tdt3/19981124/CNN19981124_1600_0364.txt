At least one person is dead, more than 300,000 people are without 
electricity today after a powerful storm ripped through the northwest. 
Kristy Lawson takes a look at the devastating aftereffects. The storm 
roared on shore, packing winds of over 80 miles per hour. It brought 
huge ocean swells all along the pacific coast. Tens of thousands of 
people lost power in Washington and Oregon. In Jefferson, Oregon, 
a gust of wind toppled this high school's 70-foot metal flagpole. 
The storm also blew a 60-foot section of the roof right off the building. 
Kids had just left except for those practicing sports and we got those 
out right away. Was anybody hurt at all by this? No, nobody was hurt. 
Maintenance crews used trash cans to catch the rain cascading through 
the soaked ceiling tiles. The computer lab was ground zero. Workers 
scrambled to move the expensive equipment and cover it. The storm 
also brought heavy snow to northern California. Whiteout conditions 
were reported on some highways, and cars were pulled from snow banks. 
I think everybody ought to take into account that it's snowing really 
bad. And they need to slow down a little bit and come prepared, because 
it's pretty bad up here. Snow flurries and a lot of wind. Tamara Stevens 
was trying to put snow chains on her tires. She was caught with just 
a blanket to protect her from the driving snow. I'm a southern californian 
and this is new. I moved to Nevada, so I guess I got to learn. All 
of a sudden, a good samaritan shows up. I couldn't just stand around 
and see her freeze in this snow. Besides, I'm dressed for it. Dave 
Ramos spends about 15 minutes wriggling around in the wet snow to 
help a total stranger. Tamara is grateful. Maybe give him a few dollars 
to get some coffee and doughnuts or something. No need for that. Dave 
says it was a pleasure just to help. Kristy Lawson, CNN.
