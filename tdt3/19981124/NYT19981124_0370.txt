Just when it appeared that Cablevision was on the verge of buying 
a majority interest in the Yankees, talks between the cable company 
and George Steinbrenner III, the team's principal owner, have broken 
down over the amount of control Steinbrenner would retain over the 
team, two people familiar with the negotiations said Tuesday. Cablevision 
Chairman Charles Dolan encountered problems in a telephone conversation 
with Steinbrenner on Monday night, a development that threatened to 
unravel the deal, according to one person familiar with the developments. 
``Chuck Dolan is not a guy who is dictated to in a business deal,'' 
said another person, a business associate of Cablevision. Because 
the principals were not talking Tuesday, it was unclear whether the 
breakdown was irreparable or if the deal could be rescued. What seemed 
evident, however, was that Dolan was not happy that some details of 
the talks had emerged publicly. The issues included control of the 
team, the sale price, which apparently has been generally overstated, 
and Steinbrenner's possible involvement with the Knicks and the Rangers, 
the teams Cablevision already owns. The breakdown in negotiations 
is considered surprising because on Wall Street, it was generally 
regarded as a nearly completed deal and a good, logical match. Before 
the breakdown, Cablevision was planning to buy about 70 percent of 
the team for something between $350 million and $365 million, according 
to those close to the talks. The price, said a business associate 
of Cablevision, was based on a valuation of the team at between $500 
million and $525 million. Steinbrenner, who has been principal owner 
of the Yankees for 26 years, has never acknowledged publicly that 
he and Dolan were close to a deal, even though associates of both 
sides said they were. Steinbrenner has said only that they were talking. 
But he had stated bluntly that if he did reach agreement to sell a 
majority interest, he would remain in day-to-day control as managing 
partner of the team. ``If it is done,'' Steinbrenner said in an interview 
that appeared in The New York Times Monday, ``the Steinbrenners will 
be in control. That's what sets Cablevision apart from others. There 
are those who would pay a lot of money and take control, but that 
won't happen. We've been in control for too long.'' Asked how long 
he and his family would run the Yankees under a different ownership, 
he said, ``It would have to be a long-term deal.'' Indeed, Steinbrenner 
and Dolan were negotiating a 25-year contract that would have paid 
the best known owner in sports $5 million a year as well as bonuses 
for post-season appearances and championships, according to those 
close to the talks. One of the people who told of the breakdown said 
that Dolan ``could not accommodate'' the kind of control Steinbrenner 
wanted. He did not elaborate. Steinbrenner, in the interview that 
appeared Monday, also raised the possibility that he would run the 
Knicks and the Rangers or at least have some role in their operation. 
``George has said so many things through the media,'' said the business 
associate of Cablevision. ``That's not the way Cablevision does business. 
Cablevision does deals very quietly.'' When corporations discuss a 
sale or a merger, they typically conduct secret negotiations for weeks 
or months and say nothing about their talks publicly. The sale of 
sports teams, however, has traditionally taken on a more public nature. 
When the Fox Group was negotiating to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers 
last year, for example, the effort was widely known. Until recently, 
Steinbrenner had said very little about his talks with Dolan, and 
even in the past week continued to deny that a deal was imminent. 
But his few comments were still more than Dolan and Cablevision had 
said publicly. They, in fact, have never acknowledged that they were 
negotiating to buy any part of the Yankees. Company statements have 
always been vague, saying only that Cablevision is always interested 
in its relationship with the Yankees; the network has a contract to 
broadcast Yankees games on cable.
