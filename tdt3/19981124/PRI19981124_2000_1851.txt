The Palestinians have inaugurated their first airport in a carnival 
atmosphere in the Gaza strip. But Israel retains overall responsibility 
over security there. From the new Gaza international airport, Jeremy 
Bowen reports. Palestinians danced and clapped as the planes landed. 
Yasser Arafat, beaming broadly, walked out across a red carpet to 
embrace the VIPs who arrived on the inaugural flights. Opening the 
airport took sustained negotiations with Israel, which retains overall 
control of security. Yasser Arafat said that he expects the airport 
to be followed up by the transfer of more occupied land to Palestinian 
control, the establishment of a safe passage by road through Israel 
between Gaza and the West Bank and then the declaration of a Palestinian 
state. Jeremy Bowen reporting.
