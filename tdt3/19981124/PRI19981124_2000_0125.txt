America Online has agreed to buying Netscape Communications Corporation 
for about $4.2 billion in a stock deal that also involves Sun Microsystems. 
The deal would unite three of the biggest competitors of Microsoft. 
Microsoft's attorney urged the government today to drop its anti-trust 
case against the software giant, saying that the AOL-Netscape deal 
showed that Microsoft was not able to quash competition in the market. 
AOL's deal with Sun calls for the two companies to develop and market 
software to make it easier and safer to buy and sell goods over the 
Internet.
