Good evening from Atlanta. Lynne Russell, "CNN Headline News." This 
holiday season, many people's favorite cards may be their credit cards. 
Indications are shoppers are ready to use them, along with cash, despite 
declining corporate profits and a volatile stock market. Joan MacFarlane 
tells us why consumer confidence is so good now. Americans appear 
ready to spend this holiday season. Consumer confidence has risen 
almost seven points since last month, when it was at its lowest point 
in nearly two years. The stock market is stronger this month, and 
interest rates remain low. Phenomenal growth and wealth because of 
stock market gains, gains in home equities. The fact is consumers 
have the wealth and income to spend. Economic troubles overseas appear 
to have little influence on the average American's outlook. Forget 
about Japan. Forget about Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, because the U.S. 
economy certainly isn't paying attention. U.S. consumers also seem 
undaunted by declining corporate profits and a volatile stock market 
at home. Right now, even though in spite of your stock market layoffs 
and what have you, you still have a lot of people who are still working. 
Corporate profits may be down, but personal profits are not. One reason 
consumer confidence is up is because people simply have more money. 
We're seeing workers' incomes outpace inflation. This is a major reason 
why workers and consumers feel more confident. Jobs are easy to get. 
College graduates face their best job market in 30 years. Consumer 
confidence is an important economic indicator, because consumer spending 
accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity. 
Us Americans, we don't live for tomorrow. We live for today. That's 
just the way it goes. If you got the money, you spend it. And if consumer 
confidence stays high, the holidays should be very merry for retailers 
this year. Joan MacFarlane, for CNN, Detroit.
