A land mine blew up two patrol jeeps of a crack antiterrorist outfit 
Tuesday in Kashmir, where Muslim insurgents are fighting a separatist 
war. Six policemen were killed and four were seriously wounded, police 
said. Elsewhere in India's state of Jammu-Kashmir, two military men 
and two militants died in a fierce gunbattle, the state's Inspector-General 
of Police P.K. Gill said. The land mine explosion occurred on a mountainous 
road in the Sriguhphara region 60 kilometers (40 miles) southeast 
of Srinagar, the state's summer capital, when members of the Special 
Task Force was patrolling in the region. The gunbattle was further 
south in Bagla village, 230 kilometers (143 miles) from Srinagar, 
Gill said. The Jammu-Kashmir government formed the task force in 1996 
to ease the pressure on the military, which is fighting a 9-year-old 
rebellion by nearly a dozen militant groups demanding either independence 
or a merger with neighboring Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of arming 
and funding the insurgency. The state is divided between them with 
both claiming the whole territory. The two nations have fought two 
of their three wars in the last 50 years over their rival claims to 
the region.
