I sometimes go with my dad to the umber store. Not every piece in 
the lumber store is even so you have to be careful. I think my dad 
learned about wood when he started working at international paper. 
If you make something out of curly wood, it'll be wobbly. And that's 
all I know about wood. International paper. Answering builders' needs, 
and yours.
