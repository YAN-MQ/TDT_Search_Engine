A goal by Bosnian Vladimir Gudlej two minutes into injury time helped 
modest Spanish side Celta outclass troubled English powerhouse Liverpool 
3-1 in the first leg of the UEFA cup third round Tuesday. Liverpool 
looked dangerous in the opening quarter and took the lead when ace 
20-year-old forward Michael Owen slotted outran three Celta defenders 
to take a lobbing pass from the midfield by David Thompson. Owen then 
raced into the box and from 12 yards fired the ball home. The England 
World Cup star had almost scored 10 minutes earlier in a similar move 
but sent the ball wide. Celta's Bulgarian forward Luboslav Penev came 
close to scoring for the homeside in the 17th minute when his thunderbolt 
free-kick from the edge of the box grazed the crossbar. Moments later 
Liverpool 'keeper David James was hard pushed to finger away a header 
from one of his own defenders following a corner kick, but by the 
break, Liverpool looked to be comfortably in control. Celta came out 
somewhat stronger in the second half and in the 48th minute got a 
deserved equalizer when Russian midfielder Alexandre Mostovoi pummeled 
the ball home from 12 yards (meters) after receiving a headed back-pass 
from Juan Sanchez on the edge of the six-yard (meter) area. Nine minutes 
later Estonian Valeri Karpin slammed home Celta's second from 11 yards 
(meters) after Liverpool's Norwegian defender Vegard Heggem fumbled 
a clearance from a corner kick. Celta's Sanchez and Mostovoi came 
close to scoring again with two shots and header in the final 20 minutes 
with Liverpool in total disarray and rarely able to get the ball into 
the opponent's half. Gudelj, who substituted Penev in the 82nd minute, 
sealed the 3-1 victory when he made the most of the confusion among 
three Liverpool defenders trying to clear the ball out only to see 
the Bosnian drive it home two minutes into injury time. Celta, playing 
for the first time ever in Europe, eliminated England's Aston Villa 
in the second round. The side lies No.2 in the Spanish first division 
ahead of giants Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. Liverpool, which has 
won six European trophies, is going through a rough patch in recent 
months as the recent resignation of assistant coach Roy Evans demonstrated. 
On Tuesday it was without key players Steve McManaman, through injury, 
and Paul Ince for suspension.
