The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and five escort ships have joined 
the American naval fleet operating in Gulf waters, a U.S. Navy spokesman 
said Tuesday. The Enterprise is scheduled to relieve the carrier USS 
Eisenhower now in the region, said Cmdr. Gordon Hume, spokesman for 
the Bahrain-based U.S. 5th Fleet. Ships accompanying the carrier include 
a cruiser, two destroyers and a submarine. The Eisenhower, which arrived 
in the Gulf on Oct. 22, is scheduled to return to its homeport of 
Norfolk, Virginia, by mid-December, Hume said, without specifying 
when the carrier will leave the Gulf. Aircraft from the nuclear-powered 
carrier fly about 100 sorties daily to the no-fly zone in southern 
Iraq. The Enterprise was ordered to move to the Gulf to join U.S. 
naval forces preparing to launch military strikes on Iraq. The strikes 
were averted Nov. 14 when Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. 
arms inspectors charged with overseeing the elimination of its weapons 
of mass destruction. With the arrival of the Enterprise and its five 
ship battle group, there are some 19 warships in the region carrying 
17,000 sailors and marines.
