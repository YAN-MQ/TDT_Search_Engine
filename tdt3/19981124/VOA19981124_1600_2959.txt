We had a down day on Wall Street with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
closing at 9,301. That was down 73 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 
Index closed at 1,183. That was down 5 points. And NASDAQ was off 
by 11. Analysts say that, after yesterday's 214-point gain in the 
Industrial Average, profit taking was inevitable. The selling was 
unrelated to any fundamental factors.
