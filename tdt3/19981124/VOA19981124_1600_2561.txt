Last month, a new coalition of 12 Serbian opposition parties came 
to Washington to try and drum up some much needed U.S. support. The 
Alliance for Change includes the parties of the former Zajedno -- 
or Together -- Coalition which backed months of anti-government demonstrations 
in early 1997 that failed to oust President Slobodan Milosevic. Obadan 
Kesich is an American adviser to Alliance leader Milan Panic. He says 
the Serbian opposition has staged its first comeback since the internal 
divisions fractured the coalition in mid-1997. Today, Mr. Kesich says 
its main goal is to remove President Milosevic from office. Now we 
have the first serious attempt to really build a broad front of opposition 
to Milosevic. Zajedno did not have a program. The Alliance for Change 
has a program. Two of the former leaders are a part of the Alliance 
for Change. Zoran Djindjic and Vesna Pezic, the Democratic Party and 
the Civil Alliance of Serbia are both political members of the Alliance. 
Obadan Kesich says last month's crackdown on Serbia's independent 
media is the most serious blow so far to the country's struggling 
independence movement. We have to keep in mind that everything stems 
from the fact that Serbia lacks democracy. And the reason behind that 
is the current regime. The regime is only fixated on maintaining its 
power. Our message of opposition to Milosevic has definitely been 
narrowed now in Serbia through the shutdown of the independent newspapers, 
the crackdown on the electronic media. What has happened now is it's 
much more difficult for the democratic movement to get a message out. 
Mr. Kesich says the only hope for Serbia and Yugoslavia is if the 
opposition can force a general election. He says the opposition should 
do better this time because the Serbian people have finally had enough 
of Mr. Milosevic, but, again, he pleaded for U.S. support toward this 
end. "Supporting Opposition Movements" was written and researched 
by VOA's Judith Latham.
