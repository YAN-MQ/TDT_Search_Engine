Chicago police went digging for more victims of serial killer John 
Wayne gacy on Monday. Jeff flock looks at what they uncovered. The 
barricades went up before dawn around a small brick apartment building 
in Chicago because -- Approximately 4 1/2 weeks ago, the Chicago police 
department received information that indicated a location of potential 
victims of John Wayne gacy. An ex-Chicago police detective said he 
saw gacy outside the apartment in the middle of the night with a dirty 
shovel in 1975. That's three years before they began pulling bodies 
from gacy's crawlspace. Police arranged for a second radar scan of 
the property to determine if gacy could have buried more victims at 
the apartment where his mother lived in 1975. Radar scoping of the 
property has been completed. The data has been interpreted in the 
soft earth. The technicians have gone back to refine the parameters 
of what they are calling two suspicious spots. Inside a white tent 
they began digging on the suspicious area, just as they had 20 years 
before beneath gacy's house of death on the outskirts of Chicago, 
it just a few miles from the apartment building. As you can see, he 
had one heck of a good recollection as to where the bodies were. But 
this time, there was no hand-drawn map like the one gacy made for 
prosecutor Terry Sullivan 20 years ago. This time there were no bodies 
at all. Both of those soft-earth sites have been excavated to conclusion, 
and they are both to be found with Negative results. Nothing in the 
parking lot gacy paved in 1975 either. After all the mapping and digging, 
they found -- A glass marble, a flattened saucepan, a chunk of concrete, 
two and a half foot strip of wire. And so ends our story, not so much 
resembling another chilling chapter in the story of John Wayne gacy 
as it does the excavation of Al capone's vaults. Still, based on what 
John Wayne gacy was capable of, those who know him say if there aren't 
more bodies here, there probably are somewhere. I'm Jeff flock, CNN, 
in Chicago.
