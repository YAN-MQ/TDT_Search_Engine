International Monetary Fund negotiators have left Russia saying Moscow 
needs to improve tax collections and draft a realistic 1999 budget 
as a condition for receiving more aid. The IMF team left Tuesday after 
refusing to release the next installment of a $22-billion loan package 
Russia needs to pay off its huge domestic and foreign debts. Kremlin 
officials say they will submit another budget proposal to parliament 
on December 7th.
