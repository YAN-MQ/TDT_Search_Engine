Jerry Springer, playing himself in all but name in ``Ringmaster'' 
(here he is Jerry Farrelly), wants us to believe that he is the great 
all-caring conduit for the voices of America's oppressed common people. 
The only time he loses his temper in ``Ringmaster,'' a behind-the-scenes 
fictional comedy about two groups of guests who collide on his television 
talk show, comes when an outraged member of the studio audience stands 
up and dismisses his feuding participants as wild animals. The host 
flushes, and his normally mild-mannered tone turns oratorical. The 
folks on his show, he declares, are no different from the celebrities 
who go on television to discuss their love lives and drug abuse, except 
that they're not rich and famous. ``This is a slice of American life, 
and if you don't like it, bite something else!'' he shouts. The audience 
cheers wildly. ``Ringmaster'' wants to polish Springer's image the 
same way that ``Private Parts'' presented Howard Stern as a cuddly 
populist crusader. It puts the best possible face on a show that turns 
brutal psychological combat into a combination of professional wrestling 
match and circus act. The guests who appear on Springer's show, the 
movie suggests, are a lot hardier than we might assume. Far from dumb 
beasts goaded to violence and exploited without realizing they are 
a laughingstock, these people have a good idea of what they're doing, 
and they want to make the most of their 15 minutes of fame. Their 
confrontations can even be cathartic. Backstage, their rages quickly 
subside, and the healing can begin. Maybe so. Then again, probably 
not. The two groups of guests, one white, the other black, both come 
from lower-income backgrounds. Connie (Molly Hagan) and Angel (Jaime 
Pressly) are a sexy mother-daughter combo (``the Judds without talent,'' 
Connie declares) from a Florida trailer park. When Connie finds Angel 
in bed with her husband (Angel's stepfather), Rusty (Michael Dudikoff), 
she promptly marches out of the trailer and seduces Angel's boyfriend, 
Willie (Ashley Holbrook). Three of the four end up on ``The Jerry 
Show.'' Meanwhile in Detroit, Starletta (Wendy Raquel Robinson) catches 
her muscle-bound boyfriend, Demond (Michael Jai White), in bed with 
her best friend, Vonda (Tangie Ambrose). Along with their pal Leshawnette 
(Nicki Micheaux), they take their troubles to Papa Jerry. More fireworks 
ensue when Angel and Demond find lust at first sight during a warm-up 
session for the show. Jerry himself is catnip to these freewheeling 
sexpots who coax him to do things like autograph the fronts of their 
skin-tight T-shirts. ``Ringmaster,'' directed by Neil Abramson, is 
acted with a spitting, snarling gusto by a cast that is as uninhibited 
as the guests on a typical ``Jerry Springer Show.'' Think of this 
as guilty Thanksgiving pleasure. PRODUCTION NOTES: `RINGMASTER' Directed
