And the National Hockey League has escalated its war on excessive 
violence in the sport by suspending Los Angeles Kings enforcer Matt 
Johnson for 12 games without pay. Johnson was suspended by the league 
Monday after he sucker punched New York Rangers defenseman Jeff Beukeboom 
in their game last Thursday. That suspension is tied for the seventh 
longest in league history. He'll lose over $90,000 in lost wages for 
that attack. That's a look at sports. I'm Steve Shine.
