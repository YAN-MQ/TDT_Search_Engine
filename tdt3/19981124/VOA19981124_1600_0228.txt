A United Nations report says despite prevention efforts, the AIDS 
epidemic is still spreading worldwide, with two-thirds of the new 
cases developing in Africa. A report by the U.N. AIDS program and 
the World Health Organization says about 11 men, women, and children 
are infected every minute by the AIDS-causing HIV virus. The worldwide 
infection rate has stabilized over 10 years, making the total number 
of people living with AIDS at just over 33 million. Twenty-two million 
of them are in Africa.
