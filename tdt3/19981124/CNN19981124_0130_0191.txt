The White House says this is the week it will provide answers to those 
81 questions about Monica Lewinsky. The questions came from the house 
Judiciary committee. Meanwhile, the panel has questioned more witnesses. 
Investigators spent more than three hours in a closed-door session 
with Dan gecker. He's the lawyer for Kathleen Willey, the woman who 
says the president groped her when she went to ask for a job. And 
at U.S. a district court, former associate attorney general Webster 
hubbell was arraigned on a third indictment brought against him by 
independent counsel Ken Starr. He pleaded not guilty to charges he 
lied to federal banking regulators and to Congress.
