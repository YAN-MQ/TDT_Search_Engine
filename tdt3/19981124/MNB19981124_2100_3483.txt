Time for a look at tomorrow's headlines tonight we begin with the 
Washington times and this story -- for only the second time in its 
history the Navy has filed criminal charges against an admiral, charged 
with two counts of adultery and obstruction of justice. The aus "today" 
has a story about take-out Turkey. More people than ever are ordering 
in or Thanksgiving dinner. The national Turkey foundation -- bet you 
didn't know there was such a thing -- reports that of the turkeys 
on tables Thursday between 1/3 and 1/3 will have been at least partially 
prepared outside the home. And in "the Chicago tribune," two former 
northwestern University basketball players were sentenced in a sports 
bribery scheme that involved fixing three basketball games in 199 
5. And once again a reminder that coming up here on MSNBC a look back 
at the children of Camelot, John and Caroline Kennedy on "time and 
again" with Jane pauley next on MSNBC. And that is our broadcast for 
this Tuesday night. We hope to see you right back here at the same 
time tomorrow night. I'm jodi A legate in for Brian Williams. Have 
a good evening. 6 35 years after John F. Kennedy's death, a look at 
his children -- Caroline and John Jr. then hand now. I'm Jane pauley 
and this is "time & again." Growing up can be difficult under any 
circumstances, but imagine doing it as the child of the president 
of the United States. In the glare of international media attention 
and intense public interest. Now add the name Kennedy. On this episode 
of "time & again," two of the best known children ever to occupy the 
period. But inflation eve, it's a special inflation in the air.
