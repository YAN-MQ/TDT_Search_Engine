A former hops brewery might seem an unlikely source for Broadway. 
But the tiny Donmar Warehouse theater in London has over time become 
a powerful producing entity way out of proportion to its 251 seats. 
While maintaining a full level of activity at home, this nonprofit 
theater has originated, in one form or another and sometimes with 
outside collaborators, three highly disparate productions currently 
on Broadway: ``Cabaret'' at Studio 54, which won last season's Tony 
Award for best musical revival; Sophocles' ``Electra,'' with Zoe Wanamaker 
in the title role, now in previews and opening on Thursday at the 
Ethel Barrymore Theater, and ``The Blue Room,'' also in previews and 
opening on Dec. 13 at the Cort Theater with Nicole Kidman in her Broadway 
stage debut. ``This is just a bumper year,'' said Caro Newling, 41, 
the Donmar's executive producer. ``It's one of those extraordinary 
sets of circumstances where everything comes together.'' Ms. Newling 
was speaking from the Donmar's Covent Garden offices around the corner 
from the theater, where she and a producing staff of nine mount about 
six productions a year on a budget of roughly $2.7 million. (By contrast, 
the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., with which the Donmar's Broadway 
``Electra'' is a co-venture, spends some $5 million annually to present 
seven plays, their annual ``Christmas Carol'' included.) The heart 
of the Donmar enterprise is its rectangular space on Earlham Street 
in the West End. It owes its name to Donald Albery, the venerable 
London theater manager, and the dancer Margot Fonteyn (Donmar deriving 
from Donald and Margot) during that period several decades ago when 
Albery was Fonteyn's friend and ad hoc manager. In 1961, his son Ian 
Albery bought what was by then a banana-ripening warehouse and transformed 
it into the Donmar Rehearsal Rooms in honor of the friendship. In 
1977, it became the London studio theater for the Royal Shakespeare 
Company, an equivalent to the troupe's Other Place in Stratford, housing 
such celebrated productions as the Ian McKellen-Judi Dench ``Macbeth.'' 
In the 1980s, the Donmar came under the artistic directorship of Nica 
Burns _ now a production director with the Stoll Moss theater chain 
in London _ who presented initial London appearances by, among others, 
Declan Donnellan's Cheek by Jowl theater company; Garry Hynes's Druid 
Theater Company from Galway, Ireland (Ms. Hynes was this year's Tony-winning 
director for ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane''), and the American singer 
Barbara Cook, whose 1987 Donmar season more or less began her career 
in Britain. The Donmar's international cachet at the moment is attributable 
to the accomplishments over his six years as artistic director of 
Sam Mendes, 33, himself director of two of the theater's current Broadway 
entries, as well as Ms. Newling and her team. They were aboard when 
the Donmar, after extensive renovations, reopened in late 1992 with 
the British premiere of Stephen Sondheim's musical ``Assassins.'' 
It was directed by Mendes, whom Ms. Newling had met in 1990 when she 
was head of press relations at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Mendes 
was then directing ``Troilus and Cressida'' at the RSC. Since then, 
said Sir Peter Hall, the veteran theater director, ``the Donmar has 
proved a settling ground for talent, and that's Sam's achievement. 
Both the West End and Broadway are great big vacuums, and talent comes 
to fill them.'' At the Donmar, Sir Peter said, ``costs are very low, 
therefore they can take risks, and if the risks work, the shows get 
exploited.'' An additional challenge for the theater has been the 
decision to earmark $1.67 million from various sources _ the Shubert 
Organization in New York is one _ to produce three shows over 18 months 
in the West End under the banner of Warehouse Productions, the Donmar's 
separate-but-equal commercial wing. The first of these, a double-bill 
of Tom Stoppard's ``Real Inspector Hound'' and Peter Shaffer's ``Black 
Comedy,'' ended a successful seven-month run in October. Next up, 
and opening in April, will be Tennessee Williams's ``Suddenly Last 
Summer'' directed by Sean Mathias. To date and Broadway aside, the 
Donmar has had three West End transfers and another to Buenos Aires, 
where David Leveaux (who is directing the current ``Electra'' in New 
York) remounted a Spanish-language version of his 1996 Donmar staging 
of the musical ``Nine.'' Some of the Donmar's greatest critical successes 
have played no more than six or eight weeks at the theater itself: 
Mendes's passionate 1993 revival of Brian Friel's ``Translations'' 
led to an offer for him to direct the play in New York, which he declined. 
His 1996 revival of Alan Bennett's ``Habeas Corpus'' turned a putative 
farce into a stinging meditation on death. All this from a stark, 
stripped-brick auditorium with a narrow gallery above the main floor, 
where, on both levels, patrons are squeezed together on cushioned 
benches. ``The Donmar is almost like an informal space,'' said Brenda 
Blethyn, the star of the Mike Leigh film ``Secrets and Lies,'' who 
was in ``Habeas Corpus'' at the theater. ``It's not sophisticated 
backstage. There are only two dressing rooms, so you all muck in. 
There's a feeling of camaraderie.'' That can make for crowded conditions 
when you have a cast not of 2, as with ``The Blue Room,'' but of 19, 
as with the current production, a revival of the 1987 Stephen Sondheim-James 
Lapine musical ``Into the Woods,'' which runs through Feb. 13. (Sondheim 
has become something of a de facto house dramatist at the Donmar, 
having had three shows there, including Mendes's acclaimed revival 
of ``Company'' in 1995.) Though Mendes is embarking on his film debut 
_ a Hollywood venture entitled ``American Beauty'' starring Kevin 
Spacey _ he has renewed his contract with the theater through March 
2002. For him, the Donmar is home. ``I care about this building,'' 
he said. ``I like the feel of it, the smell of it. I want to come 
back here as a sad git in my 60s and point at photos and go, `I did 
that.' ''
