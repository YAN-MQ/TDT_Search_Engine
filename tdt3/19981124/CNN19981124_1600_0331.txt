Joe DiMaggio's lawyer says the Yankee hall of famer did not suffer 
a heart attack last week. New York City TV station wpix reports DiMaggio 
had a heart attack last week and had a cancerous tumor removed from 
his lung last month. The station cites three anonymous sources. DiMaggio's 
attorney didn't say anything about lung cancer. DiMaggio has been 
hospitalized in Hollywood, Florida, for six weeks for what his attorney 
said was pneumonia. He turns 84 tomorrow.
