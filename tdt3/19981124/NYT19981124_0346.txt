The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25: Recent 
parliamentary elections in Slovakia have freed the country from the 
heavy boot of Vladimir Meciar, its dominant figure since the end of 
communism. Meciar engineered the breakup of Czechoslovakia, turned 
Slovakia's institutions into his political machine and allowed his 
friends to loot the treasury. The coalition of parties that defeated 
him has made a promising start, but it will need sustained unity and 
help from the West to solve the many problems Meciar left behind. 
Although Meciar is skilled at blaming others _ Gypsies, the Hungarian 
minority, the Czech Republic _ for his failures, voters got wise. 
A get-out-the-vote drive by the opposition resulted in 85 percent 
turnout and a defeat for Meciar's nationalist party. The new government 
is a coalition of rightist parties, former communists and Hungarians. 
But it quickly agreed on a program that emphasizes economic reform. 
The center-right prime minister, Mikulas Dzurinda, and his partners 
also agree that Slovakia must look toward Europe, rather than Russia 
and Ukraine as Meciar had. Slovakia's health and education systems 
are bankrupt and its banks teetering. The treasury is empty, in part 
because many of the state's factories were sold at fire-sale prices 
to Meciar's party colleagues, which also kept foreign investment out. 
The harm Meciar did to Slovakia's political culture was just as great. 
He routinely ignored constitutional court decisions and made the state 
intelligence agents into his political thugs. The new government has 
restored a respected former director to the intelligence service and 
plans to establish some oversight. Tuesday Dzurinda met with his Czech 
counterpart and pledged closer ties, reversing Meciar's policy of 
hostility. The government is also promising to end harassment of the 
media, unions and nongovernmental groups. It has already created the 
post of deputy prime minister for minorities and human rights and 
appointed an ethnic Hungarian, a positive sign. The idea of compromise 
suffocated in Slovakia under communism and then under Meciar. The 
new government could easily unravel in partisan bickering. It will 
take pressure from European institutions and the Slovaks themselves 
to keep the coalition focused on Slovakia's daunting problems.
