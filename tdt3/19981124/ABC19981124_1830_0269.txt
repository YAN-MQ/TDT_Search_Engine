In Washington today, there was a major announcement from the FDA about 
the impotence drug Viagra. The FDA is going to require new labels 
with expanded warnings about the risks of taking Viagra for patients 
with a history of heart trouble. Here's ABC's John Martin. Last summer, 
gerri howorth's husband, a retired Marine with heart problems, died 
in her arms as they made love. He said, "I love you," and then he 
started shaking and I said, "Mike, are you all right?" And he never 
answered me. Howorth says a doctor who knew her husband's heart condition 
and his medications had given him Viagra. I do think it contributed 
to his death, I think that if he hadn't taken the pill, he would be 
alive today. In today's announcement, the FDA said the drugs' manufacturer 
is relabeling Viagra, urging caution for all cardiovascular patients. 
It said a series of deaths, plus reports of heart attacks and hypertension, 
caused the action. Which will be T ow there were 69 confirmed deaths 
in the first six months after it was introduced. In August, the American 
heart association and the American college of cardiologists raised 
an early alarm, based on reports of patients who contacted cardiologists, 
like Thomas graybouys of Boston. These are individuals who perhaps 
six months ago we would have given the pill, but now, at this point 
in time, we're not giving the pill, simply because it's too dangerous 
or too potentially dangerous. a public interest medical group filed 
two petitions with the FDA, calling for urgent attention. If any of 
these people took the drug and died, and would not have taken it if 
there was a better labeling, then that's the real tragedy. Pharmaceutical 
companies always review drugs after their introduction. The irony 
of today's announcement, said one medical observer, is that heart 
patients, those most likely to suffer from using Viagra, were not 
included in its clinical trials. John Martin, ABC News, Washington.
