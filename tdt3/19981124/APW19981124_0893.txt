Tommi Makinen claimed a record third straight world rally title when 
rival Carlos Sainz had his Toyota engine catch fire just 300 meters 
(yards) from the finish Tuesday of the Network Q Rally, depriving 
the Spaniard of the world title. Sainz, in fourth place at the time, 
needed only to cross the line at the end of the final stage to claim 
the overall season title, which would have been his third. Sainz's 
fourth place would have given him three points, one more in the final 
season standings than Makinen. Briton Richard Burns in a Mitsubishi 
won the rally with a 3 minute 46 second advantage over second-place 
Juha Kankkunen's Ford with Bruno Thiry's Ford in third. Makinen, who 
entered the rally with a two-point lead on Sainz, slid out of the 
race on Sunday's first day when he skidded on a patch of oil and hit 
a concrete pillar. Sainz, one of the most popular drivers on the circuit, 
was left in tears on the roadside as co-driver Luis Moya smashed his 
crash helmet to the ground in frustration. It was a cruel finish. 
``Then engine blew, it couldn't have been worse,'' Sainz said. ``It 
seems incredible that something like this happened,'' he added. ``We 
only needed a few hundred meters. You can't have worse luck than that.'' 
``I've been in rallying for 30 years but I've never known an occasion 
like this,'' said Mitsubishi chief Andrew Cowan. ``I feel very sorry 
for Carlos and the Toyota team _ they must be devastated.'' Sainz 
was the third major star to crash out of the rally. Makinen went out 
Sunday, and former world champion Colin McRae went out with mechanical 
problems Monday while leading the race.
