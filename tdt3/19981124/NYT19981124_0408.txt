As parents prepare for the official start of the holiday shopping 
season, a consumer advocacy group Tuesday announced its annual list 
of the 20 most dangerous toys of the year. One of the most popular 
toys to make the list was the roly-poly Teletubby Po doll, which has 
a plush body and is intended for babies. Other toys on the list included 
Duplo's Preschool Building Set, Playskool's Arthur Figure Set and 
Kenner's Big Girl Baby Play Set. In a news conference Tuesday, leaders 
of the New York Public Interest Research Group said that the face 
of the Teletubby Po doll, molded into a perpetual grin, and the vinyl 
television screen set into its belly were made with a type of chemicals 
known as phthalates. The chemicals have been shown to cause liver 
damage in laboratory mice and rats. Consumer advocates worry that 
children who chew and suck on the Po doll could ingest the dangerous 
chemical. ``Parents have reason to be really concerned about this,'' 
said Tracy Shelton, staff attorney for NYPIRG, which has been conducting 
safety studies on toys since 1986. ``This chemical can result in chronic 
health problems, especially to the kidney and the liver.'' Hasbro, 
the manufacturer, dismissed the claims in a written statement. ``Let 
us be clear,'' said the statement from Wayne Charniss, a senior vice 
president at Hasbro, ``we believe our Teletubbies are safe. The preponderance 
of scientific evidence supports the safety of phthalates in toys and 
we believe parental worries have been unjustly stimulated by special 
interest groups with their own agendas.'' The Po doll is one of several 
Teletubby dolls on the market. But the others were not included on 
the list because NYPIRG officials said they had not been tested. Most 
of the toys cited by NYPIRG have sharp edges, small parts that can 
choke, or long cords that could strangle a child. Many carry warning 
labels, required by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, making 
it clear that they are not intended for children under 3. But new 
to the list this year are several plastic toys _ all perfectly soft 
and squishable _ that are considered dangerous because they are made 
with phthalates (pronounced THAY-lates). The chemical, used by toy 
manufacturers since the early 1980s, makes vinyl soft and malleable, 
much like water does for a sponge. Studies of the chemical's effects 
on rats prompted Greenpeace to call for a ban on its use by toy manufacturers. 
Manufacturers of the chemical say that phthalates do not cause damage 
to humans or other higher animals, including monkeys. The Consumer 
Product Safety Commission is considering the matter. Ms. Shelton said 
that her group is urging the government to conduct more tests on phthalates. 
She said the controversial chemical is also found in teething toys. 
Two that made her group's list of most dangerous toys are Gerber's 
Looney Tunes water-filled soother, each one shaped like a cartoon 
character, and the Cool Animal Teether by The First Year. The most 
dangerous toy on NYPIRG's list, and one that has appeared on every 
list since 1986, are balloons, Ms. Shelton said. Children can choke 
on deflated balloons, or on pieces of popped balloons, she said. Other 
toys that made Nypirg's list include: _ Mattel's ``Baby Dil's World'' 
Rugrats Play Set, which NYPIRG said had several pieces that could 
be swallowed or cause choking. _ Playskool's Talking Pay Phone, a 
large yellow telephone with several plastic coins that can get lodged 
in a child's throat. _ Unique's Flying propellers, party favors with 
several sharp pieces that could cause injuries to a child's eyes or 
face. For a complete list, contact NYPIRG at (212) 349-6460.
