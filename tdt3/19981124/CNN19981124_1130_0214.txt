After a 20-month delay, the Gaza international airport opened today 
-- the first airfield ever to operate on Palestinian-ruled soil. An 
Egypt air jet performed the inaugural touchdown. It was followed by 
airplanes from Morocco, Jordan and Spain. Under a deal struck last 
Friday, the Palestinians were allowed to open the airport, but Israel 
retains authority over what countries can serve it and what routes 
they can fly. Palestinians hope it will boost their weak economy and 
serve as a symbol of eventual autonomy.
