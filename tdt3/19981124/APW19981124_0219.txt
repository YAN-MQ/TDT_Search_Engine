Philippine stocks rose for a third straight session Tuesday, buoyed 
by Wall Street's overnight gains and a cut in the central bank's key 
borrowing rate, traders said. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange 
Index rose 38.99 points, or 2 percent, to 1,961.25 after a 4.4 percent 
surge Monday. Traders said Wall Street's overnight gains injected 
fresh funds into Asian stock markets, including the Philippines. Interest 
in select blue chips also boosted Philippine share prices, they said. 
Among the most actively traded stocks were Philippine Long Distance 
Telephone Co. and holdings concern Metro Pacific Corp., a unit of 
Hong Kong's First Pacific Corp. First Pacific announced after the 
end of trading Tuesday that it has acquired 27.4 percent of PLDT, 
the Philippines' largest telecommunications company. PLDT's share 
price fell 30 pesos, or 2.8 percent, to 1,055 pesos on rumors of the 
buy-in. Metro Pacific's shares, meanwhile, gained 0.2 centavos, or 
just less than 1 percent, to 2.14 pesos. Analysts said the 0.25 percentage 
point cut in the central bank's overnight borrowing rate will release 
more domestic funds to the stock market. Russell Ong, senior analyst 
at Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc., said, however, that it is unlikely 
the additional funds will be used for long-term stock market investments. 
``Despite the positive sentiment in the market, many still remain 
cautious,'' he said. The central bank cut its overnight borrowing 
rate, its main tool in controlling domestic liquidity, to 13.500 percent 
from 13.750 percent. It also cut its overnight lending rate by 0.25 
percentage points to 15.500 percent. The cut is in line with the 0.25 
percentage point cut in U.S. short-term interest rates last week and 
was largely expected by market participants. In currency trading, 
the peso closed slightly lower as the cut in interest rates released 
more pesos into the financial system, traders said. Generally weaker 
regional currencies and the lack of positive developments on the domestic 
front likewise weighed on the peso, they said. The dollar averaged 
39.606 pesos for the day, up from Monday's 39.551 pesos. It traded 
in a thin range of 39.510 pesos to 39.760 pesos and was last traded 
at 39.600 pesos. The peso's losses were tempered by expectations of 
dollar inflows in coming weeks, mainly from direct foreign investments, 
stock investments and remittances from Filipinos working overseas, 
traders said. An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, sending 
home around dlrs 6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange remittances 
provide an important contribution to the Philippine economy and are 
expected to help support the peso over the rest of the year.
