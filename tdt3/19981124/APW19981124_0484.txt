Ethnic Albanian rebels on Tuesday freed a kidnapped Serb policeman 
after U.S. diplomatic observers intervened to persuade them to let 
him go. ``It was a gesture of good will by the Kosovo Liberation Army,'' 
said KLA representative Adem Demaci, adding that with the release, 
``the regime was given a chance to start releasing detained Albanians 
and turn over a new leaf in our relations.'' Yugoslav authorities 
have reportedly detained hundreds of ethnic Albanians on suspicion 
of participating in the KLA, which they consider a terrorist organization. 
Guerrilla hostages have been Serbs or Albanians considered loyal to 
them. The KLA, at the forefront of the armed struggle for majority-Albanian 
Kosovo's independence from Serbia, was still believed holding two 
ethnic Albanian civilians who vanished along with the policeman Nov. 
17. Although last month's agreement was aimed at ending hostilities 
between the KLA and the joint Serb-Yugoslav forces opposing them, 
isolated fighting continues. The Serbs accuse the guerrillas of attacking 
them, while the KLA says it is only responding to attacks from Serb 
police. The prearranged handover of Serb police inspector Goran Zbiljic 
took place Tuesday morning near an armed rebel stronghold on a hill 
overlooking the town of Podujevo, northeast of the provincial capital 
Pristina. It was negotiated by American members of the Kosovo Diplomatic 
Observer Mission _ the main foreign monitoring force in Kosovo until 
a recently approved international verification mission is launched. 
While the observers looked on and armed guerrillas stood watch nearby, 
a KLA vehicle drove up and Zbiljic stepped out. He said he had been 
kept alone in a room for the duration of his detention but had not 
been mistreated or beaten. ``War is not good. There has to be peace,'' 
he said as he stepped out of the car. ``As soon as possible, the politicians 
have to do something because people are dying, people are suffering.'' 
Colleagues shook his hand and embraced the policeman, accused by the 
KLA of looting abandoned ethnic Albanian houses. The foreign observers 
have been talking with both sides in recent weeks, concerned by an 
increase of shooting incidents blamed on both Serbs and rebels. After 
talks in Belgrade with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill late Monday, Serbian 
President Milan Milutinovic condemned ``terrorist acts'' by the KLA 
. Ethnic Albanians make up roughly 90 percent of the 2 million people 
living in Kosovo. Most advocate independence from Serbia, the dominant 
republic of Yugoslavia. Hundreds of Albanians, mostly civilians, were 
killed and hundreds of thousands displaced during a crackdown by Serb 
and Yugoslav authorities from February to October. An Oct. 12 agreement 
led to a withdrawal of many Yugoslav forces and a fragile cease-fire. 
But violence continues as international officials try to produce a 
political settlement on Kosovo's future status. Ethnic Albanians have 
rejected the latest offer by the Serbs to negotiate over Kosovo without 
the foreign mediation they demand.
