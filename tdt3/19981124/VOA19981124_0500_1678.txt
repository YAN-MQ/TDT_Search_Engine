In just a couple of days, the Macys' Thanksgiving Day parade will 
come down the streets of Manhattan. But, the well-loved Dr. Seuess 
character, "The Cat in the Hat", will be missing this year. This is 
because of what happened last year when high winds caused, " The Cat 
in the Hat" balloon to hit a lamp post, which then fell on a spectator, 
who then sued the city of New York, and Macys, for $395 million. Well, 
parade director, Gene McFadden said several steps have been taken 
to ensure safety. Parade organizers are increasing the number of handlers, 
anchoring the balloons to utility vehicles and giving more training 
to staff. Lampposts are also being modified, following last year's 
accident. The city task force imposed size restrictions on balloons, 
to over-sized balloons, "The Pink Panther" and "Woody Woodpecker," 
will also be sitting out this year's parade. That is one of the staples 
of this countries... Of the holiday season, yes that's a hallmark... 
Of the holiday season. That really marks it off. Get up in the morning, 
I remember as a kid, going down to the black and white TV -- in the 
morning, because we lived in another time zone, watching it on television 
and just thinking, " Santa Claus can't be too far behind." I mean, 
there was -- and then you watched the Mummer's parade out of Philadelphia 
-- and they have all sorts of parades to mark the day. And then... 
But it still seems like forever until Christmas. Oh, it's forever 
till Christmas. And the older I get, the more I looked at that parade 
and I said, "Boy this thing lasts forever, and ever, and ever." And, 
when you're a kid, you wanted it to last forever, and ever, and ever. 
So, then, anyway. Well, have a good holiday. And, sorry to say, Dr. 
Seuess won't be there, but the parade will go on.
