For today's geography quiz, we're taking you to a capital city in 
Western Europe that will, as of next year, no longer be a capital. 
The first settlement here dates back to the first century A.D., when 
the Romans established it as a river crossing, and today it's still 
a sleepy town on the banks of the Rhine River, despite the fact that 
it was chosen as the provincial capital of West Germany in 1949. Along 
with being a capital, this town is known as the birthplace of Beethoven. 
In fact, the town has a modern concert hall named after the famous 
composer. In 1991, the German parliament decided, narrowly, to move 
the capital from this place to Berlin. And for the past seven years, 
they've been preparing for the transfer, which is to be completed 
next year. So, where are we? And what are they going to do with all 
those government facilities that they can't move to Berlin? Stay tuned. 
You'll have the answers in just a few minutes.
