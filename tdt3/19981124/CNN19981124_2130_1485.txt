A passion Paul Newman discovered almost 30 years ago is still one 
of the loves of his life. Gloria Hillard spent some time on the fast 
track with the Hollywood legend. Enter the world of champion auto 
racing team competition for the first time and the first thing you 
notice -- It's exciting, it's not like it's noisy. I can see by your 
earplugs -- yes? -- that you're a race fan. You bet. In this world 
of big tires, fast cars and noise, we spotted a Familiar driver rounding 
the practice pace car run. At 140 miles an hour, 73-year-old Paul 
Newman is right at home. Newman is a great driver. Actually, he's 
a man that started pretty much -- pretty late in life. He knew what 
it took to do it and to be good. I just spoke with Mario andretti 
and he's says you're quite a Driver. He's lying. I have -- For an 
actor, he said. I have some fun out there. Geez, that's where you 
should be looking. Talk to Newman near the track and, well, you can 
see firsthand the love he has for this place. His passion for racing 
began on a film set nearly 30 years ago when he starred in the film 
"winning" with his wife Joanne Woodward. -- And perhaps they'll bring 
in a leader today. At the age of 47, he began his race car career. 
Well, considering that I was 87 years old when I got started, it was 
-- yeah, it was a hell of a challenge. He's been in the winner's circle 
a number of times, including coming in second at Le mans. It's the 
only sport that I ever did that I found any grace in. And I'm not 
a very graceful fella. Where you ever scared? Sure. Newman retired 
a few years ago. Now he's a race team owner, but looking back at those 
years on the racing circuit -- what did you learn about yourself? 
About myself? I learned that a lot of the discipline that you get 
in acting you have to use in these cars. You have to focus. When the 
Oscar-winning actor isn't on a racetrack or on a film set, he oversees 
his charities. He's donated over $80 million from his food products. 
There's not too much that will slow down this movie star, unless it's 
a Reporter apprehensive about going 140 miles an hour, even if he 
did say that was slow. Gloria Hillard, "CNN Entertainment News," Fontana, 
California.
