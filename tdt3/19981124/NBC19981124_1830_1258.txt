Back in this country -- your health insurance. Managed care plans 
that require prior approval before your doctor can give certain treatments. 
Someone from the insurance company has to decide whether to pay or 
not. Who makes that critical decision? You might be surprised. Here's 
NBC's Jim Avila. It's 8:00 A.M., far from any hospital. Upstairs in 
this modest suburban home, Claire enners is making medical decisions 
for Prudential insurance, telling doctors how patients can be treated. 
It's called pre-authorization -- permission to treat the most critical 
phrase in managed care medicine of the '90s. Enners, and 10,000 case 
managers like her, use company guidelines to decide what care gets 
paid. Yes, there are rules to follow. But life has rules. And life 
isn't fair. I didn't get an emg, they wouldn't okay an emg. But critics 
call case managers roadblocks to good medicine medical clerks paid 
to delay and say no. Dr. Rudy gallardo, an orthopedic surgeon for 
36 years. When we're made to wait months on something that should 
have been done two months ago, its going to threaten the patient's 
health. Who are these case managers making initial life and death 
medical decisions? Enners is a registered nurse with 12 years experience, 
a mother of two connected to her company's rule book by computer. 
There are no government standards for her job. The insurance industry 
merely recommends that they be "qualified health professionals." With 
a salary between $40,000 and $60,000, enners gets no bonus. We work 
on straight salary. It's not how much money we save. At 1:00 P.M., 
enners checks on a chronically ill patient. She says she rarely denies 
care. Her company cites a less than 1% turndown rate. And enners insists 
decisions are not based on money alone. A denial's not nice. It's 
not nice for the patient, and it's not nice for us. Many Americans 
say it's the system that's not nice, complaining that insurance companies 
have too much power over their medical care. A recent poll shows that 
81% of Americans want more government protection from their HMOs. 
By the end of the day, after 30 phone calls, enners understands the 
suspicion on the other end of the line. People don't like having insurance 
in their business. And I think that is the main reason for the Negative 
response, that someone's watching what they're doing. Especially when 
that person is often anonymous and far from the hospital. Jim Avila, 
NBC news, Chicago.
