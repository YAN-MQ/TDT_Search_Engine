In the National Football League, New England Patriots quarterback 
Drew Bledsoe shook off a hand injury and connected on a late-game 
scoring pass to lift his team to a 26-23 win over the Miami Dolphins 
Monday night. With the Patriots trailing by 4 points, Bledsoe mounted 
an 80-yard scoring drive in just under three minutes, and he capped 
it off with a 25-yard strike to receiver Shawn Jefferson with just 
29 seconds left in the game. Bledsoe said he could not feel the broken 
index finger in his throwing hand during the game-winning drive and 
wasn't sure whether he was helping or hurting his teammates with his 
performance. Bledsoe said scoring the winning touchdown in the waning 
minutes was what quarterbacks dream of. It's a situation that as a 
quarterback you dream about and look for and to have it be successful, 
you know, feels pretty good. But on the other side of the ball, Miami 
defensive back Terrell Buckley said that the Dolphins had no reason 
to lose Monday Night's game. They took their self ahead, but we still 
had the game won. Thirty-four seconds left. They had the ball at the 
20 or whatever. Yeah, we were supposed to win that. Dan Marino was 
24 of 38 for 300 years and a pair of touchdown passes for Miami which 
had won 14 straight road games when they were leading at halftime. 
The win puts New England back into the playoff picture with a 6-and-5 
record. The loss drops the 7-and-4 Dolphins into a three-way tie for 
first place in the AFC East.
