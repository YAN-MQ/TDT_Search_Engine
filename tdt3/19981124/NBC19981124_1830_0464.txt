Now to Washington and another political storm. Attorney general Janet 
Reno has decided not to appoint an independent counsel to look into 
some of vice President Gore's fund-raising activities. NBC's White 
House correspondent David Bloom joins us now. Tom, the attorney general 
says there's "clear and convincing evidence" vice President Gore did 
not lie to investigators about his fund-raising activities Gore says 
he's pleased, republicans are seething. At issue -- did Gore tell 
the truth when he denied knowing that this 1996 democratic ad campaign 
was paid for, in part, by so-called "hard money" donations -- money 
Gore helped raise? Money which is tightly regulated. Today, in her 
19-page ruling, the attorney general said there is only "weak circumstantial 
evidence" against Gore which "fails to provide any reasonable support 
for a conclusion that the vice president may have lied." A key republican 
lashed out at Reno saying she is either "corrupt, stupid, wrong or 
incompetent." And it's beginning to look really smelly. I mean, I 
hate to say it. But having cleared the vice president, Janet Reno 
must decide within the next two weeks, whether to seek independent 
counsels to investigate President Clinton or his former deputy chief 
of staff haroldic kiss. tom? David Bloom at the White House tonight.
