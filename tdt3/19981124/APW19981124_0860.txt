Francesco Totti converted a penalty kick in second-half injury time 
to give Italian league great AS Roma an undeserved 1-0 victory against 
FC Zurich in their third-round first-leg game of the UEFA Cup Tuesday. 
Zurich players bitterly protested the referee decision to grant the 
home team a penalty when Totti himself was pushed by defender Franco 
Di Jorio close to the Swiss net as he tried to reach a long cross 
in the 91st minute. Totti's goal extended Roma's unbeaten streak to 
15 games at Rome's Olympic stadium but failed to excite fans who occasionally 
booed the unimpressive play of the home team before the late game 
winner. In fact it was underdog Zurich to produce the best scoring 
chances at the Olympic stadium. Quick forward Frederic Chassot kicked 
the ball past the bar, from a few meters in the 33rd minute, after 
rushing alone into Roma's penalty area. Five minutes before Roma's 
keeper Antonio Chimenti had made a decisive save on a powerful drive 
by South African forward Thurston Bartlett. Chassot had another scoring 
chance in the 60th but his shot was stopped by Chimenti, a substitute 
of Roma's No.1 Austrian goalie Michael Konsel who's recovering from 
surgery. Roma, often overwhelmed at midfield, wasted a scoring chance 
with Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio in the 42nd while Totti hit the 
post with a diagonal shot in the 15th. Totti had earned and converted 
a controversial penalty kick also in Sunday's league game against 
Bari, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Swiss officials were furious with 
British referee Young who ignored a dubious intervention by Damiano 
Tommasi on Brazilian forward Lima inside Roma's penalty area in the 
50th. Roma, second to Fiorentina in the Italian league standings, 
will travel to Zurich for the second leg on Dec. 8.
