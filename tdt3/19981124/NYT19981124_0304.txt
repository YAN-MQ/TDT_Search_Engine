The federal government said Tuesday that it had received significant 
evidence that a joint venture created by Sprint Corp. and Telefonos 
de Mexico, or Telmex, had committed anticompetitive practices in the 
long-distance market. As a result, the Federal Communications Commission 
rejected the venture's proposed rates that are charged to other long-distance 
carriers. The agency also gave the venture 30 days to explain why 
officials should not review its long-distance license. ``U.S. consumers 
have to pay much more than they should to reach friends and relatives 
in Mexico,'' said FCC Chairman William Kennard. ``The carriers have 
not moved quickly enough to bring these rates down and ensure meaningful 
competition.'' Kennard said the high rates affected ``the most vulnerable 
consumers,'' recent Hispanic immigrants who used the service to talk 
with friends and relatives back home. Sprint officials said the joint 
venture had been caught in a struggle between U.S. and Mexican authorities, 
and that the company's pricing had not been unreasonable. ``We're 
disappointed by today's development,'' the company said in a statement. 
``The Telmex-Sprint Communications joint venture is in the marketplace 
today, enjoying initial success because it provides a service that 
Hispanic and other consumers want and need. We are confident that 
neither any U.S. carrier nor the public interest has been hurt by 
TSC's entry into the U.S. market.'' Gary Epstein, a lawyer in Washington 
representing Telmex, said the venture had met all of the conditions 
of the license and that the company would dispute the allegations. 
The joint venture's license was approved three months ago over the 
objections of the two biggest long- distance carriers in the United 
States, AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom Inc. The high volume of calls between 
the two countries has generated some $700 million last year in payments 
to Telmex, far and away the largest payment overseas by U.S. carriers. 
In granting the license, regulators had imposed a list of conditions 
intended to keep the marketplace competitive. Officials said Tuesday 
that those conditions had not been met, and they took action following 
a new round of complaints by AT&AMP;T and MCI that the joint venture 
remained fundamentally anticompetitive. At the heart of the Tuesday's 
action are the rules and fees governing the so-called settlement rate, 
the fees that phone companies make to each other to complete calls. 
Settlement rates have historically been set well above the cost of 
completing a call, particularly in countries with less-developed economies 
or powerful state-owned telephone monopolies. Officials said that 
any reduction in the rates would be passed on to consumers in the 
form of lower telephone bills. Telmex had promised to lower the settlement 
rate to 19 cents a minute by the beginning of the year 2000. The FCC 
approved the 19-cent rate but rejected the company's interim rates 
of 37.5 cents for 1998 and 34.5 cents for 1999. The agency also described 
a variety of other anticompetitive practices, such as a 58 percent 
surcharge levied by Telmex for international calls made to Mexico. 
While officials said that the proceeding initiated Tuesday might not 
lead to the revocation of the venture's license, they expected it 
would encourage significant changes that would open the market to 
competitors of the Sprint-Telmex venture.
