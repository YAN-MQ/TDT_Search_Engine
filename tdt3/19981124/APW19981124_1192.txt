A second Alomar was all the Cleveland Indians ever wanted or needed 
to end their second-base mess. Roberto Alomar joined his brother Sandy 
on the American League Central champions, agreeing Monday to a dlrs 
32 million, four-year contract. Indians general manager John Hart 
announced the contract on Tuesday at Jacobs Field with the nine-time 
All-Star. ``In Roberto Alomar, the Indians have acquired one of the 
elite second basemen in the game today,'' Hart said. ``We are elated 
to have the Alomar brothers in the Indians family.'' Roberto Alomar, 
coming off an dlrs 18 million, three-year contract with Baltimore, 
gets a dlrs 1 million signing bonus, dlrs 6.5 million next season, 
dlrs 7 million in 2000, dlrs 7.5 million in 2001 and dlrs 8 million 
in 2002. Cleveland has an dlrs 8 million option for 2003 with a dlrs 
2 million buyout. Roberto Alomar said he was proud to be playing with 
his brother. ``It means a lot to be beside my brother, not only to 
me but to my family,'' he said after Sandy presented him with an Indians 
jersey with the No. 12. ``This has always been a dream. And for us, 
this dream has come true.'' Alomar's addition finally gives the Indians 
stability at second base, ending a revolving-door of 15 players who 
have played the position since the club traded away Carlos Baerga 
in 1996. Cleveland will also have one of the strongest and flashiest 
middle infields in baseball history with Alomar pairing with Omar 
Vizquel for a deadly double-play combination. Both players have won 
six Gold Gloves at their respective positions. ``It would be worth 
the price of a ticket just to watch Omar and Robbie turn a double 
play,'' Hart said last week. The Indians used six players at second 
during the '98 season alone, and went into the postseason with Joey 
Cora there after acquiring him in a late-season trade with Seattle. 
Cora hit just .059 in the playoffs and he became a free agent after 
Cleveland declined to exercise his 1999 option. Roberto, 30, has been 
in Hart's sights for several years, and when Alomar became a free 
agent this winter, Hart made him his No. 1 priority. Alomar and his 
agent, Jaime Torres, met with Hart and Indians owner Dick Jacobs in 
Cleveland last week, and reports had the sides close to striking a 
deal. With Alomar playing second and likely batting second behind 
Kenny Lofton, Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove has a lineup with a 
current or former All-Star at every position, and one only rivaled 
by the World Series champion New York Yankees.
