Another big rally for Japanese stocks, the EK225 Index gaining 385 
points, 2.6 percent to 15,165. And, that's despite the added weight 
of falling banking industry earnings. Jason Janes, with HSBC Securities 
in Tokyo told VOA that Tokyo investors were strengthened by the confidence 
shown in the U.S. market. What we're seeing here is renewed confidence 
in the U.S. economies for next year. We're seeing a little bit of 
strength in the dollar, as well on back of that. And, so it's really 
the Asia exporters that are leading this morning in Japan. In technicals 
like electrical machinery, precessions, automobiles, those kinds of 
areas, which will benefit from continued strength in both the U.S. 
economy and the dollar.
