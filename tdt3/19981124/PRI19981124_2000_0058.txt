From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. 
Senate Judiciary chairman Orrin Hatch is accusing Attorney General 
Janet Reno of playing politics with the campaign finance investigation. 
Reno declined to recommend an independent counsel on allegations against 
Vice President Gore. NPR's Peter Kenyan reports. While Gore was said 
to be pleased that Reno found insufficient evidence to recommend the 
appointment of an independent counsel, Republicans were angry. Senator 
Hatch told reporters that it's no secret that Reno's being advised 
by David Kendall's former law partner. Kendall is President Clinton's 
personal attorney. Hatch charges Reno with triggering a series of 
90-day reviews under the independent counsel statute in order to shut 
off criticism. We've been putting up with this for a long time. This 
is like the seventh 90-day inquiry in this matter. And it's beginning 
to look really smelly. Hatch says if Reno fails to recommend an independent 
counsel for campaign issues involving the president and ex-chief of 
staff Harold Ickes, he may attempt to take future independent counsel 
decisions out of the attorney general's hands. Peter Kenyan, NPR News, 
the Capitol.
