Talk about getting stuck in a tough situation -- this cat climbed 
a 30-foot telephone pole two days ago, but was too scared to climb 
down. Monday rescuers came to his aid, sort of. As they approached, 
the cat got spooked and decided to take his chances in the air. Somehow 
he managed to beat the odds, landing safely on his feet, as cats want 
to do, and he walked away.
