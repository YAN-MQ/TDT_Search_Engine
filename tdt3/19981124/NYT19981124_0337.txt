Intuit Inc. reported a fiscal first quarter loss Tuesday, reflecting 
the costs of developing tax preparation products to sell in coming 
months. The loss had been expected. Intuit, which is based in Mountain 
View, Calif., has been shifting from a traditional packaged software 
producer to an Internet-based business model. But though its sites, 
including Quicken.com and QuickenMortgage, are among the most popular 
on the World Wide Web, more than 90 percent of its revenue still comes 
from software programs like Quicken, the personal finance package, 
and -TurboTax. Intuit reported its financial results after the market 
had closed. In Nasdaq trading, Intuit shares closed at $59.875, down 
$4.25. Analysts said that the drop reflected profit-taking after Intuit's 
$6.63 gain in the rally Monday, and that the quarter contained no 
surprises. For the quarter that ended on Oct. 31, Intuit reported 
a loss of $49.2 million, which included charges resulting from the 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related expenses of 
$22.8 million. It had a net loss of $12.8 million for the first fiscal 
quarter last year. Revenue rose 17 percent, to $112 million from $96 
million. Without the charges, Intuit had a loss of $26.8 million, 
or 45 cents a share, fully diluted. Analysts surveyed by First Call 
Corp. had expected Intuit to lose 46 cents a share. Lise Buyer, an 
analyst with CS First Boston, said the quarter essentially matched 
her expectations, with some growth that was better than expected in 
QuickBooks, Intuit's bookkeeping software for small businesses. ``The 
software business is holding its own and they have a huge potential 
upside on the Internet,'' she said. If the company can persuade the 
13 million Quicken users to start using its Internet sites, ``they 
have a huge shot at being the big winner in online financial services,'' 
she said. Intuit's financial results reflect the seasonal nature of 
its businesses, particularly its tax return preparation products. 
The company typically produces most of its annual profits in the January 
and April quarters and posts losses in the July and October quarters.
