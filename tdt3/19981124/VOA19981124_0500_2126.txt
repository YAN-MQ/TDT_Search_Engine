Former Lebanese Army Commander, Ahmael Lahude, has been sworn in as 
the country's new president. Mr. Lahude was unanimously elected by 
parliament in mid October, and enjoys the backing of Syria, which 
has thousands of troops in Lebanon. He succeeds Alias Hirali who oversaw 
the end of the Lebanese 15-year civil war in 1990. In a farewell speech, 
Monday, Mr. Harali said his only regret was not being able to end 
Israel's occupation of South Lebanon. Mr. Harali launched an ambitious, 
post-civil-war construction program, after dismantling Lebanon's warring 
militias.
