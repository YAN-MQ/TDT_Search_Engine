Baseball legend Joe DiMaggio reportedly has lung cancer and had a 
heart attack last week. The New York Yankees hall of fame outfielder 
has been in a Hollywood, florida, hospital since mid October. CNN's 
New York City affiliate wpix reports three anonymous sources say diMaggio 
had a tumor removed from his lung last month. But DiMaggio's lawyer 
says he is being treated for pneumonia and a lung infection. In statements 
to the press, his lawyer has said Dimaggio is doing well and improving 
after being "very ill." DiMaggio turns 84 tomorrow.
