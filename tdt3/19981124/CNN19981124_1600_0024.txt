attorney general Janet Reno has decided not to order an independent 
counsel to investigate vice President Al Gore for possible fund-raising 
abuses. Gore is accused of soliciting campaign donations from White 
House offices, which is a violation of federal election laws. Neither 
Gore nor the administration is off the hook. In a 19-page filing, 
Reno said -- "there is no reasonable grounds to believe that further 
investigation is warranted." And Reno says she will continue investigating 
potential fund-raising abuses by President Clinton and other White 
House staff members.
