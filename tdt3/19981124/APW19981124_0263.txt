Lawyers for President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday appealed a court ruling 
that quashed a government investigation of racism and mismanagement 
in rugby. The ongoing battle about the sport, once heralded as a way 
of uniting South Africa's races, has caused divisions in the country. 
The South African Rugby Union had gone to court to block the government's 
investigation, dragging the president to the witness stand. Many blacks 
felt that was a deliberate attempt by the white-dominated sport to 
humiliate South Africa's first black president. That impression deepened 
after Judge William de Villiers ruled in favor of the rugby league 
and rebuked Mandela for insolence during his testimony. De Villiers 
was appointed a judge under the apartheid regime that ended with 1994's 
first all-race election of Mandela as president. Lawyer Wim Trengove 
told a panel of Constitutional Court judges that de Villier's judgment 
was invalid, and asked them to set it aside. The Constitutional Court 
is South Africa's highest legal body. Rugby has vast support among 
Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended settlers who dominated apartheid governments 
and still maintain a stranglehold on most professional teams. Blacks 
grew to hate the sport during the apartheid era, associating it with 
the white minority. But Mandela tried to use rugby to promote racial 
reconciliation after he took power and urged blacks to support the 
victorious national team in the 1995 World Cup.
