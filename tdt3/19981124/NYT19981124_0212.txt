When you read one of Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid's cookbooks, 
there is no sense that they have been home in their kitchen dreaming 
up novel book ideas and recipes for Americans. Instead, they seem 
to take you on the road with them, weighed down with a backpack, scribbling 
notes, eating with your hands and wondering what day of the week it 
is. Alford and Ms. Duguid are married and they write as a team, traveling 
the world and studying food and diet through a cultural lens. Their 
latest book, ``Seductions of Rice'' (Artisan, $35), is simply stunning. 
The book's many location photographs, taken by the authors, show how 
rice is harvested, how it is sold and often how it is cooked. They 
emanate life: you feel the steam curling up from a pot of rice in 
Thailand and wetting your nose, and the candid stare of an Indian 
woman hauling fish home from a river. After a section of basic information, 
the book is divided by region, from Senegal to Mexico. In the Thai 
chapter, for instance, Alford and Ms. Duguid discuss the essential 
flavors in Thai cooking and the many types of rices used. Basic cooking 
instructions are given. But most of the chapter is taken up by Thai 
recipes. The scarcity of recipes that actually involve rice is perhaps 
the most surprising thing about the book. The authors are careful 
not to overstate rice's role in the gastronomy of certain cultures, 
and they do not try to enhance its sophistication. It is often cooked 
simply _ steamed or boiled _ then served with meat or vegetable dishes. 
The chapter on Central Asia and Persia, for instance, contains two 
recipes for everyday Persian rice, and is followed by recipes like 
Persian lamb kebabs with sumac and rhubarb-lamb stew. Almost everything 
I cooked was flawless. The Thai grilled red snapper with basil was 
sharp on the tongue. Its soft texture was the perfect contrast to 
the sticky rice. The grilled eggplant salad was great for the first 
few bites _ tart and powerful _ but grew increasingly salty. With 
a little less Thai fish sauce, it would be fantastic. In the Indian 
chapter, the Kerala coconut chicken curry was blazing with heat from 
chilies, but was balanced with a fragrant masala paste and coconut 
milk. The spicy yogurt sauce with banana, made with a paste of mustard 
seed, cayenne, coconut and a pinch of turmeric, was delicious, if 
odd: it lay between a condiment and a dessert. Perhaps the best recipe 
out of the 10 that I tried was the aromatic rice pudding from India. 
As it cooks, the milk reduces, and just about every ounce of flavor 
is coaxed out of the cardamom pods and cinnamon, leaving a soupy, 
sweet and wildly flavored reduction of milk thickened with rice.
