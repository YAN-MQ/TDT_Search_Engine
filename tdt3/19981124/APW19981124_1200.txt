MONACO (AP) - Monaco twice came from behind Wednesday to secure a 
2-2 draw against Marseille in the first ever UEFA Cup match between 
two French teams. But it was Belgian referee Amand Ancion who was 
at the center of attention, sending off Marseille's Florian Maurice 
and Monaco's Franck Dumas for innocuous challenges. Robert Pires opened 
the scoring in the tenth minute of the third round, first leg game, 
after poor defending from Monaco. Maurice collected a misplaced pass 
from Dumas near Monaco's right corner flag and set up Pires who fired 
impressively past Fabien Barthez from 15 yards (meters). Marseille 
was in total domination until Ancion made his first controversial 
decision of the night, awarding a penalty to the home side in the 
17th minute penalty. Ancion harshly penalized Laurent Blanc for holding 
Victor Ikpeba, and David Trezeguet made no mistake from the penalty 
spot. A 38th minute strike from Tita Camara gave Marseille the lead 
for a second time, after more errors from the Monaco back line. Two 
Monaco defenders failed to head out a long kick from goalkeeper Stephane 
Porato and the ball found its way through to Camara, who fired through 
the legs of Barthez from the edge of the penalty area. The impressive 
Ludovic Giuly scored a brilliant 57th minute equalizer with a 20 yard 
(meter) strike past Porato, a player sold by Monaco to Marseille at 
the start of the season. Maurice was shown his second yellow card 
in the 63rd minute after sliding to stop a Barthez clearance, but 
making minimal contact. The Marseille striker had been shown a yellow 
card for a innocuous seventh minute tackle. Six minutes later, Dumas 
was ordered off after remonstrating with Camara, who had lunged dangerously 
at Barthez. The second red card sparked more angry scenes between 
the players. Monaco and Marseille have shared several bruising encounters 
in recent years, with 31 yellow cards and three sendings off in the 
previous six meetings between the two teams.
