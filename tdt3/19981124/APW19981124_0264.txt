Two people were killed and scores injured Tuesday when a car bomb 
exploded in front of the German Embassy, witnesses said. The bomb 
shattered windows and sent shards of glass flying into the embassy 
and damaged parts of the wall, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. No one at the embassy was injured, said a German diplomat 
also insisting on anonymity. The two Yemenis who died were pedestrians 
passing by the embassy. About six people were taken by ambulance to 
hospitals, and many others suffered minor wounds. The bomb explosion 
set the car next to it on fire but firefighters have managed to put 
out the blaze, the witnesses said. The Mazda carrying the bomb was 
parked outside the embassy in the residential Hadda area, where most 
embassies are located. The German embassy is right next to the house 
of prominent political figure Sheik Mohammed bin Shajeh, who security 
officials suspect may have been the target of the attack. The site 
has been cordoned off by police, who are not allowing anyone to enter 
or leave the area. No other details were available. Yemen, a poor 
nation of 17 million on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is largely 
inhabited by tribes who do not hesitate to use firearms to settle 
scores with rivals or to express discontent with the government.
