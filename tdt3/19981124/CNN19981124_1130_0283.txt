Crime is driving people from major U.S. cities, according to the results 
of a new study. Economists looked at 127 cities using three decades 
of U.S. census data as well as crime statistics from the FBI. Researchers 
say each major crime causes one person to leave a city. The study 
finds people with children and those with more than a high school 
education were twice as likely to leave a city because of crime than 
childless people without a high school degree. Nationwide, crime has 
been dropping for six years.
