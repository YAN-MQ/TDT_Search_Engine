Greyhound Bus Lines isn't commenting on a discrimination lawsuit filed 
by a passenger in Tucson, Arizona. Mark Moran reports from member 
station KJZZ in Phoenix. Pamela Fogg claims a Greyhound bus driver 
discriminated against her because she's blind. She says the driver 
left her stranded at a remote bus stop in Texas while returning to 
Tucson on a trip from Chicago last summer. She alleges in her suit 
that the driver left her at the stop on purpose because she repeatedly 
asked for a seat in the front of the bus, typically reserved for physically 
handicapped passengers. According to the lawsuit, the driver took 
Fogg's bags into the Greyhound ticket office inside a Weatherford, 
Texas, convenience store and left her stranded. Greyhound has not 
commented on the alleged incident. Fogg eventually caught another 
bus and is seeking unspecified compensatory damages and trying to 
make sure Greyhound complies with the Americans With Disabilities 
Act in its treatment of handicapped passengers. For NPR News, I'm 
Mark Moran in Phoenix.
