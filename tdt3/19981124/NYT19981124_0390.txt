Joe DiMaggio, hospitalized here since Oct. 12, turns 84 on Wednesday 
amid mounting concern over his condition. WPIX in New York, which 
had long televised Yankee games, reported Tuesday night that DiMaggio 
had lung cancer and had a tumor removed from his left lung last month. 
The station also said the Hall of Famer had a heart attack last week, 
basing its report on three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
On Tuesday, Tony Segreto, a longtime news anchor at WTVJ, a Miami 
television station, said he confirmed the WPIX report from a person 
at Memorial Regional Hospital, where DiMaggio is a patient. The Miami 
station said DiMaggio was on a ventilator, but ESPN reported Tuesday 
that DiMaggio's condition had improved enough so that he was off life 
support. Morris Engelberg, a lawyer and a friend of DiMaggio's who 
has been serving as his spokesman since he entered the hospital, denied 
that DiMaggio had had a heart attack. ``DiMaggio never had a heart 
attack _ this is totally false _ and he is not in grave condition,'' 
Engelberg said in a statement from his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., office. 
`` DiMaggio and his family heard this information on the television 
and were very upset.'' In his statement, Engelberg, in referring to 
the reported heart attack, said, ``We were all shocked by this false 
rumor.'' Engelberg did not comment on the report that DiMaggio has 
lung cancer. DiMaggio remains in intensive care at the hospital, where 
he was admitted for what was described as pneumonia and a lung infection. 
His birthday will be limited mostly to family. Among those expected 
to visit are his granddaughter Paula and her husband, their two daughters, 
Joe's brother Dom and Engelberg. ``I'm going to take a ride down there,'' 
Dom DiMaggio said Tuesday night from his Boynton Beach, Fla., home. 
``I'm hoping maybe we'll have a celebration of some kind.'' Dom DiMaggio, 
the former Boston Red Sox center fielder, declined to discuss his 
brother's condition, saying Engelberg is the spokesman. Engelberg 
said in his statement that DiMaggio has advised him to no longer discuss 
his health with anyone other than DiMaggio's doctors and immediate 
family. Meanwhile Joe Nachio, an old friend of DiMaggio's, said the 
former Yankee felt better after talking to Engelberg on Tuesday. ``Morris 
just told me now that he's wide awake, he's gained 20 pounds, he's 
starting to smile and he recognizes a conversation and the people 
around him,'' Nachio said from his office in Panama. Officials at 
Memorial Regional Hospital have refused to comment on DiMaggio's condition.
