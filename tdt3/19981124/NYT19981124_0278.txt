Novell Inc. reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded estimates 
by Wall Street analysts, and attributed the performance to strong 
sales of the new version of its network operating system, Netware 
5. Novell announced its results after the close of the market. Shares 
of Novell closed at $17.38, down 63 cents, in trading on the Nasdaq 
market. For the quarter ended Oct. 31, Novell had earnings of $42 
million, or 12 cents a diluted share, more than five times the $7.2 
million, or 2 cents a share, reported in the period a year earlier. 
Revenues rose 10.5 percent, to $297.6 million from $269.3 million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997. Analysts expected Novell to 
earn 9 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation. ``The 
strategy is clearly working,'' said Novell chairman and chief executive 
Eric Schmidt in a telephone interview. ``My strategy was to turn this 
thing into a viable robust business and I think we have done that,'' 
he said. ``A lot of it was due to Netware 5, but we saw business up 
across many product lines.'' Netware 5 is the first release of Novell's 
operating system to adhere completely to Internet-based standards 
rather than its own internal set of rules and practices. The program 
also incorporates Novell's directory services technology for identifying 
and locating myriad users and computers across multiple networks. 
During the quarter, Novell signed agreements with Cisco Systems Inc., 
Lucent Technologies and Nortel under which they will incorporate Novell 
directory technology in their products. ``My objective to establish 
Novell as an Internet company is being achieved,'' Schmidt said. ``As 
we flesh out the strategy, the real value is in applications we develop 
that use the directory,'' he said. These are primarily network management 
programs for large enterprises. ``It's a very big space because people 
have huge problems in this area,'' he said. For the year, Novell reported 
earnings of $102 million, compared with a loss of $78.3 million in 
fiscal 1997. Revenues rose 8 percent, to $1.08 billion from $1.01 
billion.
