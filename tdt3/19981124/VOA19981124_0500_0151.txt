Hundred of Indonesian students have, again, taken to the streets of 
Jakarta to press for reforms. More than 500 demonstrators marched 
towards the presidential palace, but they were blocked by security 
forces. At least 500 others gathered outside the Attorney General's 
office, but police did not intervene. Meanwhile, an Indonesian newspaper 
says the military has jailed 163 soldiers who are allegedly involved 
in bloody clashes with protesters, this month.
