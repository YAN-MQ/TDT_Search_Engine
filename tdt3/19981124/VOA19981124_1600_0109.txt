In Iraq, the news media have reacted strongly to a meeting in London 
this week of more than one dozen Iraqi opposition groups. Correspondent 
Scott Bob reports from our Middle East Bureau that the media campaign 
also continues against U.N. weapons inspectors. This as the U.N. Security 
Council prepares to examine Iraq's claim that it has turned over all 
relevant documents concerning its weapons of mass destruction. Newspapers 
in Baghdad Tuesday condemned the British-sponsored meeting of Iraqi 
opposition groups in London. Editorials said efforts to overthrow 
the government of Iraq could destabilize the entire Middle East. The 
"al-Jumhouriya" newspaper called the policy naive and reckless and 
questioned its morality. Many newspapers called on Arab nations to 
help thwart the plans. Meanwhile, Iraqi officials continue to criticize 
U.N. Chief Weapons Inspector Richard Butler for demanding a number 
of documents related to the Iraqi disarmament process. Iraq says the 
documents are either irrelevant or non-existent. Scott Bob, VOA News, 
Middle East Bureau.
