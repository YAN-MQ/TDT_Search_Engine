When I asked my mother to give me all her recipes, she was offended. 
``Why?'' she snapped. ``I'm not dead yet.'' ``I realize that,'' I 
replied, ``but if I do this now, you'll be here to answer my questions, 
right?'' She growled something in assent. The only time she likes 
logic is when she thinks of it first. So I made a list of 35 dishes 
and she took a year (a year!) to write them down. She presented them 
to me with a lovely note that contained the sentence, ``Try them, 
adjust seasoning to taste, call me if these don't work.'' I should 
have known. I started with the roast turkey, an old family recipe 
handed down from our Brazilian hairdresser five years ago. I looked 
at Mom's instructions. All I needed to do was get a turkey and marinate 
it for 24 hours in red wine and a long list of seasonings, none of 
which came with measurements. Fine. I could figure that out. But a 
day later when I was ready to cook, I looked at what else she had 
written. Wait a minute. I called her. ``Don't you usually put something 
inside the turkey?'' I asked. ``Well, yes,'' she said. ``You can put 
onions in there, or apples and prunes, or oranges.'' ``Mom, you have 
never once put anything in this turkey but onions,'' I said. She started 
to laugh. ``Well, yes, but you (italics)could(end italics) put in 
the other things.'' ``OK, I get it,'' I said, annoyed. ``This is your 
passive-aggressive protest to my presuming to take your mommy power 
away, right?'' She laughed even harder. ``Oh, and by the way,'' she 
said, gasping for air, ``slice an onion or two and put it in the bottom 
of the pan with some water, for when you baste it.'' I looked at the 
recipe. The word onion never appeared once, much less twice. ``Fine,'' 
I said coldly. I could have strangled her. Her tone turned conciliatory. 
``Listen, sweetheart,'' she said. ``I used to get upset with my mother, 
too, whenever I would ask for her recipes, because she never measured 
anything. She would tell me what I always told you: `Watch me.' You 
do it so many times you don't pay attention to how much you use, whatever 
it is. You see how it smells, how it looks. It's not always the same.'' 
``But I want it to be the same,'' I said. ``I want my house to smell 
the way yours does on holidays where everything's delicious and everyone 
feels warm and protected and lucky to be there.'' ``It'll be fine,'' 
she said, losing interest as her own guests rang her bell. ``If you 
have trouble call me.'' She hung up. I followed her instructions and 
put the turkey in to roast. In the meantime, I made mashed potatoes. 
I've always felt deprived when it came to mashed potatoes. Growing 
up as I did in a kosher home, the only time you could make them for 
real was to eat with fish, since butter, cream or milk cannot be mixed 
with meat. In our house, mashed potatoes meant salt and margarine. 
So, over the years, I have studied different recipes and finally come 
up with a version I like. In any case, I focused on the turkey, which 
cooked faster than Mom said it would. I called my husband and 14-year-old 
stepson, Simon, to the table. Simon was impressed. ``You made a turkey 
for no reason?'' he asked. ``Yeah, I wanted to practice,'' I said. 
``Cool,'' he answered while his father carved. It tasted exactly like 
my mother's. I couldn't believe it! Maybe all those times I watched 
her really did pay off. I filled our plates, and the three of us talked 
and ate and Simon told a story and we laughed, and then he told jokes 
and we laughed some more and then we all had seconds. The light seemed 
golden somehow, and if there was no wind or rain pounding the windows, 
there could have been, we were so cozy inside. Simon turned to me, 
his face aglow. I glowed back. I had done it, replicated the turkey, 
made it home. ``These are the (italics)best(end italics) mashed potatoes 
I've ever had,'' he rhapsodized. Oh. I was taken aback. ``I'm glad,'' 
I said. He kept his eyes on me. ``How do you make them?'' he asked. 
I went blank, but his gaze never wavered. ``Butter,'' I started. ``Cream.'' 
He nodded. Our plates were emptied, the magic moment had passed. He 
went to watch television. I walked back into the kitchen, the turkey 
forgotten. The last thing I had ever suspected was having mystical 
powers of my own. I glanced at the remnants of butter and cream. How 
much had I used? I couldn't remember. I thought of Simon's face, looking 
at me, eyes wide. And I realized why writing these recipes had been 
so hard for my mother. And for her mother. Because it's not about 
butter or cream or onions. The ingredient you can't write down is 
how much you love your family _ how you relish feeding them, caring 
for them, watching a child's face transform in an instant, looking 
up at you with a mouthful of food and safety and wonder. ``How was 
the turkey?'' Mom asked when she called the next day. ``Great,'' I 
said. ``A big success.'' She was pleased. ``What did you make with 
it?'' she asked. I hesitated. ``Mashed potatoes,'' I answered. ``Oh,'' 
she replied. ``Do you have a good recipe?'' I smiled. ``Actually,'' 
I said, ``I do.''
