But, one of the most interesting mergers under discussion, is the 
all-stock purchase of Netscape Communications by the world's largest 
Internet provider, America on Line. Netscape pioneered the Internet 
browser, and is involved in the U.S. government's anti-trust case 
against Microsoft. David Levee, Internet analyst with ING Barring 
Firm and Sells, told Bloomer News, he thinks AOL is taking advantage 
of the situation. I think AOL and some of the other operators are 
using this as a preempted strike against Microsoft being too successful, 
as they have been in other space. But, I think this is a real deal 
for AOL and a really good time for them to do it. The deal could also 
restore Netscape's position as a major force in the Internet browser 
market.
