Federica Faiella and Luciano Milo of Italy were neck and neck in first 
place with Russians Natalia Romaniuta and Danil Barantsev Tuesday, 
following the compulsory dances at the world junior figure skating 
championships. Faiella and Milo, who won the silver medal at the world's 
last year, led the Russians after the Viennese waltz but dropped behind 
the pair after the tango. The result was encouraging for Romaniuta 
and Barantsev as they finished a distant seventh a year ago at the 
championships in New Brunswick, Canada. Jamie Silverstein, 14, and 
Justin Pekarek, 17, of the United States, took third place at the 
early stages of this event, while their compatriots, Melissa Gregory, 
17, and James Shuford, 20, placed eleventh. Compulsory dances make 
up 20 percent of the overall score. The original dances, counting 
for 30 percent of the total, will take place on Thursday, to be followed 
by the free skate on Friday. The men's short program, led by rising 
Russian star Ilia Klimkin, is the other event scheduled later Tuesday.
