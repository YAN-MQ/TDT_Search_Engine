Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa, who ran the fastest marathon in history 
this year, believes he can go even faster in next year's London Marathon. 
Da Costa clocked a world best of 2 hours, 6 minutes, five seconds, 
at the Berlin Marathon on Sept. 20. That surpassed the previous record 
of 2:06:50, set by Ethiopia's Belayneh Densimo at Rotterdam in 1988. 
Announcing his entry for the April 18 London Marathon, Da Costa said 
he was capable of lowering the mark again. ``Firstly, I would like 
to win the race. If it goes well, I would like to make a change here,'' 
the Brazilian said, pointing to the 2:06.05 printed on his sweatshirt. 
``During the race I'll see how things are going and make the decision 
then.'' That's just what Da Costa did when he broke Densimo's 10-year-old 
mark in Berlin. Attempting to run around 2:07, he was told halfway 
through the race that he was well outside that schedule. He quickened 
and ran the second half of the Berlin race in an amazing 61 seconds 
compared with 64 for the first half and surprised the crowd by doing 
two victory cartwheels after crossing the line. ``In Berlin I did 
two cartwheels, in London I'll do three,'' Da Costa said through an 
interpreter. The field for the race will also include 1996 Olympic 
champion Josia Thugwane of South Africa and 1996 Olympic silver medalist 
Lee Bong-Ju of South Korea. ``With the world's fastest man, the Olympic 
champion and Olympic silver medalist, we're confident we will have 
the strongest London Marathon ever,'' Bedford said. Also entered is 
two-time London champion Antonio Pinto of Spain, winner in 1992 and 
1997, whose fastest time for the race, 2:07.55, is in danger. ``After 
his run in Berlin, Ronaldo has to be the most sought after and exciting 
runner in the world of distance running,'' said London Marathon director 
David Bedford, who estimated the Brazilian would collect some dlrs 
200,000 if he broke the world mark at the race. A former soccer player 
who played in goal for his home town team, Descoberto, despite being 
only 5-foot-6 (1.67 meters) tall, Da Costa and his twin brother, Romildo, 
entered a local road when prize money was offered. They finished second 
and third. One of 12 children, Ronaldo said he took up running seriously 
when he was offered a job and the company sponsored him while his 
brother gave up the sport because he didn't get the sponsorship.
