Will huge amounts of Vitamin C protect your health? Best selling alternative 
health guru Dr. Andrew Wile recommends taking a daily minimum of 2,000 
milligrams of Vitamin C. That's 33 times higher than the U.S. government's 
recommendation. The late Nobel Prize winner Dr. Linus Pauling also 
claimed that mega doses of Vitamin C boost immunity. Last year, a 
study published in the journal "Nature" warned that 500 milligrams 
a day of Vitamin C actually damaged cells. Studies since then discount 
this finding and show that the body absorbs only a moderate amount 
of Vitamin C. The broad consensus of Vitamin C studies shows that 
small amounts of Vitamin C, 200 to 350 milligrams daily, readily available 
from a healthy diet, help prevent a number of serious illnesses. These 
include coronary heart disease, cancer, cataracts, and possibly arthritis, 
asthma, and macular degeneration. As for preventing colds, no research 
since Dr. Pauling first pushed mega doses in the 1960s, has shown 
that Vitamin C reduces the likelihood of catching cold or even that 
Vitamin C shortens the duration of a cold. I'm Jane Hughes.
