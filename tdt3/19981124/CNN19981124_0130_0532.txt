With the holidays approaching, a parents group is issuing a warning 
about toys it says promote violence. The "lion and lamb project" has 
released a "dirty dozen" list, identifying 12 toys it considers particularly 
worrisome. Its executive director says some toys include graphic, 
"blood-splattered" portrayals, while others encourage simulations 
of violence that children may fail to distinguish from reality.
