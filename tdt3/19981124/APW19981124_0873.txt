Pete Sampras began his bid to make tennis history Tuesday by beating 
Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4 at the start of the ATP World Championship. 
Sampras, seeking to become the first man to finish as No. 1 in the 
world for six years in a row, crushed the same opponent he beat in 
last year's final, when he won his fourth title in the elite season-ending 
tournament. ``I don't want to say it was a statement, but I definitely 
was very focused,'' Sampras said. ``I think the guys know that, that 
this is an important week and it showed.'' ``I just hope I can maintain 
this level throughout the week, which is not going to be easy. But 
today was definitely a good start,'' Sampras said. In a battle between 
the other two players in Sampras' Red Group, Carlos Moya rallied to 
beat Karol Kucera 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 6-3. Moya, the French Open champion, 
won his first indoor match of the year, after going 0-5 until Hanover. 
The Spaniard turned the match in the second set, when Kucera first 
double-faulted to give Moya a set point and then hit a simple forehand 
into the net. Moya broke serve for a decisive break of serve in the 
third set of the match that lasted 2 1/2 hours. Sampras rolled through 
the first set with his powerful serve-and-volley game, making few 
errors and keeping Kafelnikov on the defensive. Sampras also broke 
the Russian's serve in the opening game of the second set. But Kafelnikov 
battled back when his passing shots found their range and he pulled 
level at 3-3. It proved to be a brief revival for Kafelnikov. Sampras 
won the next two games and had a match point at 5-3, but Kafelnikov 
hit a service winner to save himself. Sampras had trouble closing 
the match. He wasted four more match points, one on a double-fault 
and had to fight off a break point. But two straight backhand errors 
by Kafelnikov finally gave Sampras the victory after 66 minutes. ``I 
definitely had a lot of work to do in the second set,'' Sampras said. 
``I didn't want to do what I did last year when I lost my first match 
and played a little bit flat. I didn't want to dig myself into a hole, 
having to win my next two matches.'' Marcelo Rios, who trails Sampras 
by only 33 points in the rankings and has a shot at taking over the 
No. 1 spot in final year rankings, played the last match of the day, 
against Tim Henman. Kafelnikov was the last player to clinch a place 
in the dlrs 3.5 million tournament that brings together the eight 
players with the best results in the year. The round-robin portion 
consists of two four-man groups, with two players from each advancing 
to the semifinals. Sampras now has a 10-2 career lead over Kafelnikov 
and has won heir last six matches. He beat Kafelnikov in three quick 
sets in last year's final. To remain ahead of Rios, Sampras basically 
has to keep pace with the Chilean. Rios needs to win at least two 
round-robin matches to have a shot at No. 1. Two players from each 
group advance to the semifinals. Sampras has finished the last five 
years as No. 1 in the world, a record he shares with Connors, the 
fellow American who did it from 1974 to 1978.
