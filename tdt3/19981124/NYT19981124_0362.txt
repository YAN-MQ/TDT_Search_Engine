The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25: When 
Michael Hardwick looked up from the privacy of his apartment in Atlanta 
one day 16 years ago, he was stunned to see a policeman standing in 
the door. ``What are you doing in my bedroom?'' he asked. It is a 
question that took on a special bitterness for gay men and lesbians 
after the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986 upheld the Georgia law against 
sodomy under which Hardwick was arrested that day. The law was 170 
years old. It prohibited oral and anal sex by anyone, homosexual or 
heterosexual, and like all such laws in the United States it was modeled 
on old English law, which was shaped by religious teachings. In his 
argument to the Supreme Court, Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers 
attacked homosexual sodomy as ``anathema to the basic units of our 
society _ marriage and the family.'' Five justices bought the argument, 
upholding the law in a decision that removed any claim homosexuals 
had to privacy or to protection from government intrusion in their 
bedrooms. To decide otherwise, Chief Justice Warren Burger said, would 
``cast aside millennia of moral teaching.'' But the critical constitutional 
question, Hardwick's lawyer later wrote, ``was not what Michael Hardwick 
was doing in his bedroom, but rather what the state of Georgia was 
doing there.'' On Monday, ruling in another case, the Georgia Supreme 
Court agreed, and struck down the law. This case arose from heterosexual 
acts between a man and woman, but the court made clear that Georgia's 
Constitution guarantees rights of privacy that make no distinction 
between homosexuals and heterosexuals. ``We cannot think of any other 
activity that reasonable persons would rank as more private and more 
deserving of protection from governmental interference than consensual, 
private, adult sexual activity,'' it said. The Georgia decision follows 
one by a city circuit judge in Baltimore last month who held that 
Maryland law could not discriminate by making sodomy illegal for homosexuals 
and not for heterosexuals. In Rhode Island, the legislature voted 
to repeal its anti-sodomy law earlier this year. One way or the other, 
in almost two-thirds of the states, outdated legal restrictions on 
private sex have fallen away. The remaining holdouts should drop the 
last traces of this assault on privacy.
