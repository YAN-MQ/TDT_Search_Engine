Adela Guerrero says she's having a blast learning to read at age 65. 
And she owes it all to a fellow student, her 91-year-old mother. In 
a mountain hamlet of 250 people called Guajar el Alto in southern 
Granada province, they religiously attend an adult education class 
four days a week, two hours a day, right after lunch. ``It's a great 
two hours,'' said Guerrero by telephone Tuesday. ``The teacher is 
very nice.'' ``They show promise,'' said the teacher, Francisco Lopez. 
``These women want to do things.'' Of nonagenarian Adelaida Vasco, 
who has four children, eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, 
Lopez says the rest of the dozen or so students in the class are crazy 
about her. ``They treat her with love, respect and affection. At first 
the class was hard for her because she had never been to school,'' 
Lopez said. ``But little by little, she is catching on.'' Guerrero 
said she and her mother wanted to make up for opportunities they have 
missed over the course of a rough life. Her mother, for instance, 
lost her husband and a son in the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. ``We 
didn't have a chance to go to school,'' Guerrero said. ``All we did 
was work.'' Guerrero explained that she got the education bug from 
her mother after Lopez called Mrs. Vasco to suggest they go to school. 
``It was all my mother's idea,'' she said. Mrs. Vasco could not be 
interviewed at length because she has trouble hearing over the telephone. 
Asked how she felt, she said ``clumsy'', then handed the phone to 
her daughter.
