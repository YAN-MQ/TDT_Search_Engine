Dennis Rodman is on the rebound after slam dunking his marriage to 
Carmen Electra. The multi-tattooed, cross-dressing basketball star 
known as the Worm filed papers Monday seeking an annulment from his 
26-year-old bride, citing fraud and unsound mind. His lawyer said 
the Chicago Bulls star was drunk when he married the former ``Baywatch'' 
actress and MTV hostess in a quickie Las Vegas ceremony Nov. 14. Rodman, 
like the rest of players in the National Basketball Association, had 
plenty of time on his hands because of the ongoing lockout by team 
owners. ``Dennis alleges he was so inebriated at the nuptials that 
he didn't know which end was up, what he was doing,'' his lawyer Gerald 
Phillips was quoted as saying in today's New York Post. Rodman's agent, 
Dwight Manley, made the same charge two days after the wedding. ``Obviously, 
anyone that would marry somebody that was intoxicated to the point 
that they couldn't speak or stand had ulterior motives of some sort,'' 
Manley said at the time. A handwritten note purportedly written by 
Rodman was released soon after, in which he professed his love for 
Electra and apologized ``for any false statements given on my behalf 
regarding my marriage.'' But Phillips told the Post that Rodman, 37, 
didn't even write the note. ``My understanding is, the handwriting 
is not his. And it's not his language either. Dennis does not talk 
that way,'' he said. Ms. Electra's publicist, Cindy Guagenti, denied 
the note was forged and said it was signed in her presence. But she 
said things soon went downhill. ``Carmen and Dennis spoke several 
days ago and mutually agreed (to end the marriage),'' Ms. Guagenti 
said. The honeymoon was apparently short _ Rodman claims the two separated 
the day of the wedding. Rodman was married once before, and it could 
be said this wasn't the first time since then that he had toyed with 
the idea of marriage. He once dressed up in a white wedding gown and 
a platinum wig to sign autographs for one of his books, ``Bad As I 
Wanna Be.''
