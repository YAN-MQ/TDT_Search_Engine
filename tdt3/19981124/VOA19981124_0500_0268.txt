Funeral services are to be held, today, for Russian lawmaker, Galena 
Staravotoyva, in St. Petersburg, where she was killed by unidentified 
gunmen. VOA Moscow correspondent, Peter Hineland reports the latest. 
After private church services and a public memorial at a St. Petersburg 
museum, the 52-year old lawmaker will be laid to rest in the Alexander 
Nebski Monastery on the banks of the Neva River. The cemetery is reserved 
for distinguished Russians. Among those buried there are famed composer 
Peter Tchaikovsky, and author Feodor Dostoyevsky. Police say Ms. Staravotoyva's 
murder was a professional job, and may have had a political motive. 
At the time of her death, the lawmaker was trying to form a new political 
block to compete in upcoming local elections. She indicated she might 
run for the regional governership. Authorities detained several suspects, 
but say no one has been charged. Past professional killings in Russia 
have gone largely unsolved, however, and police officials privately 
admit there is little chance that Mr. Starvaotoyva's killers will 
be found. Peter Hineland, VOA News, St. Petersburg.
