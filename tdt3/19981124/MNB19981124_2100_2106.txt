It used to be that the U.S. postal service was the only choice when 
it came time to send off those holiday packages and you had to plan 
ahead. Now there are competing shipping companies all offering overnight 
service but can you really count on that? Here's Robert Hager. What 
happens once you seal the box and that holiday gift gets sent off? 
Does it get there late? Get banged around? Make any difference whether 
it's FedEx, U.P.S., or the post office? To find out, the magazine 
"consumer reports" sent out packages, same size andweight, to hundreds 
of addresses. The results, anything but merry pour the -- for the 
post office. If they don't deliver overnight you can get your money 
back but that won't help if the box doesn't get there over night. 
And when it comes to ordinary no-rush delivery, the study conducted 
this time last year found both the post office and U.P.S. were late 
20% of the time. The post office says it will do better this Christmas. 
We have made the investments in our infrastructure and added the people 
to make the service better. And the battle isn't just fought on delivery 
routes. The post office spends nearly $250 million on ads touting 
its V FedEx claims the ads are misleading and is suing. After delivery 
the sensors showed that for the past service one out of every 10 packages 
shipped by the post office and even more shipped by U.P.S. or FedEx 
suffered the equiffent of this, from seven feet, a straight drop. 
Even when "fragile" was plastered all over the boxes, it didn't help. 
And something else to cheer the mind as the holidays approach -- eight 
of the packages never arrived at all. Three from the post office and 
five from U.P.S. simply disappeared.
