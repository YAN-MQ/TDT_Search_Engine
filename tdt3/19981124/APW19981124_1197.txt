Uneasy neighbors Saudi Arabia and Yemen have agreed to prevent hostile 
political activities and media campaigns against each other, officials 
said Tuesday. The two countries also agreed on the need to implement 
a tentative border agreement signed in 1995, said the Yemeni officials 
who spoke on customary condition of anonymity. They gave no details 
of the agreements. Saudi officials also were not immediately available 
for comment. Officials said the agreements were reached during the 
visit of Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz. He ended 
his two-day visit Tuesday after meeting with President Ali Abdullah 
Saleh. The agreements could help ease tensions between the two countries 
whose troops have often engaged in skirmishes along the 2,000-kilometer 
(1,300-mile) frontier. Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim 
to three Red Sea islands and parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert 
region with potentially lucrative oil fields. The two nations have 
yet to demarcate a mountainous border in the east. Border talks have 
been stalled since four months and Yemen is frustrated by the lack 
of progress and has said it will consider seeking international arbitration. 
Yemen accuses Saudi Arabia of helping finance its exiled opposition 
and of being behind a series of explosions in the southern port city 
of Aden last year. Yemen also claims that a number of men implicated 
in an assassination attempt against Arab last year are hiding out 
in Saudi Arabia. For its part, Saudi Arabia accuses Yemen of allowing 
arms and drugs to be smuggled through its borders to Saudi Arabia, 
the official said.
