A member of the house Judiciary committee says he plans to offer a 
Resolution to censure President Clinton instead of impeach him. Democratic 
congressman William Delahunt of Massachusetts says the measure would 
condemn the president's relationship in the White House with Monica 
lewinsky. But it would not include any punishment. Delahunt's alternative 
is unlikely to sway the 21 republicans on the committee, but it could 
have an effect on the house floor.
