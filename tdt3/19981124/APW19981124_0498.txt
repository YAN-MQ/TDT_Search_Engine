Irish President Mary McAleese received an honorary degree and unveiled 
a memorial to Irish famine victims Tuesday at the start of a two-day 
official visit to Britain. During a ceremony at Liverpool's Anglican 
cathedral, Mrs. McAleese was given an honorary fellowship by the city's 
John Moores University. Dressed in a red suit and green coat, Mrs. 
McAleese was greeted at the cathedral by the university's vice-chancellor, 
Prof. Peter Toyne, Liverpool's Lord Mayor Bert Herrity and dean of 
the cathedral, the Very Rev. Derrick Walters. Past honorees have included 
Cherie Booth, wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, playwright Alan Bleasdale 
and actress and lawmaker Glenda Jackson. Later, Mrs. McAleese unveiled 
4-meter (13-foot) high slab of granite commemorating the victims of 
the 1840s potato famine in Ireland, many of whom fled to England through 
this northwest English port. On Tuesday evening, she was due to give 
a lecture at John Moores University and attend a reception by Irish 
expatriates. On Wednesday, she is scheduled to meet students from 
the University of Liverpool and visit an Irish housing charity.
