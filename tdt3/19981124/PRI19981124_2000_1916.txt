The British government has unveiled plans to throw hereditary peers 
out of the upper house of parliament, the House of Lords. It was announced 
in traditional style by Queen Elizabeth in a speech at the start of 
the new parliamentary session. The opposition conservatives who dominate 
the House of Lords have pledged to fight the change. BBC political 
correspondent Tim Franks. The symbolism was dramatic. Amid centuries-old 
pageantry, the Queen addressed both houses of parliament in the splendid 
upper chamber of the House of Lords. Many of her audience were lords 
who had inherited from a previous monarch the right to be there. Now, 
the Queen in one simple sentence told them that their time was up. 
A bill will be introduced to remove the right of hereditary peers 
to sit and vote in the House of Lords. The Queen has, in the past, 
been listened to in silence. But after announcing that change, the 
Queen had to pause as parliamentarians rumbled their support or their 
opposition. It was a sign of the constitutional battle that will follow.
