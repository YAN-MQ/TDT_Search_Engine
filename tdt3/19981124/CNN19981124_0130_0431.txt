Some said it would never last, and it didn't. CNN has learned that 
basketball star Dennis Rodman has filed for annulment in his marriage 
to actress and former "Playboy" model Carmen Electra. They were married 
just last week in Las Vegas. Rodman told a lawyer he was not of sound 
mind and inebriated at the time of the nuptials. The lawyer says Rodman 
is also claiming fraud as a condition of the annulment.
