Pressure grew on OPEC to act to lift sagging oil prices as prices 
headed to record lows in London. Ministers from OPEC's 11 member states 
planned a year-end meeting Wednesday. In Iraq, an oil official pleaded 
with OPEC to take action, saying low prices had stripped about dlrs 
2 billion from the maximum dlrs 5.2 billion it is allowed to export 
in its current food-for-oil deal with the United Nations. ``We have 
been producing an average of 2.5 million barrels a day and exporting 
between 1.8 to 1.9 million barrels a day. Still we failed to meet 
our own financial ceiling,'' Faleh al-Khayat, director-general of 
studies and planning in Iraq's Oil Ministry, told The Associated Press. 
``We could have easily done the dlrs 5.2 billion or even more had 
it not been for the drastic decline in oil prices,'' al-Khayat said. 
Iraq is an OPEC member but has stayed away from past meetings because 
of the U.N restrictions that keep it from selling its oil freely. 
It also was not sending a minister to the Vienna meeting. In London, 
Brent crude oil January futures slipped again on the International 
Petroleum Exchange to a low of dlrs 11.19 a barrel Tuesday afternoon, 
before creeping up slightly to dlrs 11.33. OPEC's average price per 
barrel in the third quarter has slumped by about 30 percent. OPEC's 
predicament is due an untimely decision to boost production last winter, 
just as demand growth was dropping because of Asia's financial crisis. 
The resulting oil glut hammered prices, helping consumers but hurting 
oil-dependent economies back home. Publicly, OPEC members have been 
tightlipped on solutions. Arriving Tuesday afternoon, Venezuelan oil 
minister Dr. Erwin Jose Arrieta said only that both OPEC and non-OPEC 
oil producers needed to seek out new markets. ``It's a ... challenge,'' 
said Arrieta, whose country is widely believed to be a key offender 
in overproduction, an issue expected to figure high on the talks' 
agenda. Major ideas to have emerged so far ahead of the meeting include 
trying to tighten compliance with production cuts, introduced in June 
to soak up the glut; extending the cuts; cutting further, and calling 
an exceptional heads of state meeting, an idea proposed by Algeria 
and supported by the United Arab Emirates. Pushing hard for further 
cuts to the 2.6 million barrels a day agreed in June is Kuwait, backed 
by Algeria. OPEC now produces a total of 26.9 million barrels a day, 
including Iraq. Saudi Arabia, the cartel's top producer with 8 million 
barrels a day, wants increased compliance with existing cuts. Excluding 
Iraq, where compliance is high, compliance overall is about 93 percent, 
the International Energy Agency said, in a report based on the latest 
October figures. However, compliance, 12th graf
