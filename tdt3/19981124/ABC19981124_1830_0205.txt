The independent counsel, Kenneth Starr says his office could have 
done a Better job of handling Linda Tripp, the woman who taped Monica 
Lewinsky. In an interview with Dianne Sawyer, judge Starr said he 
did not know at the time that Tripp was also working with lawyers 
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against the president. Linda 
Tripp. Linda Tripp, leaving your office and going home and talking 
to Paula Jones' attorneys that night at the very least, is this control 
of your witness? I think we could have had better control. Should 
have? Yeah, in fact, I think in retrospect it would have been a better 
thing. You really had no idea that she was going -- My people did 
not. My people have assured me, and I credit this, that they had no 
indication whatsoever of any involvement. And Mr. Starr said when 
they did learn of her involvement with the Jones case, his office 
took steps to protect their investigation.
