Just a few days after the 35th thiffer of President Kennedy's death 
there is a new -- anniversary of President Kennedy's death there is 
a new look at the last weeks of his life. Tonight the John F. Kennedy 
library released 36 hours of never before released tape recordings 
from the oval office, all recording the very end of the Kennedy years. 
Here's Fred Francis. The recordings show a decisive President Kennedy 
during the Cuban missile crisis but later remorseful over the U.S.-supported 
coup in Vietnam. Kennedy, who would be killed just two weeks later, 
dictates his regrets over the assassination of the Vietnamese president. 
During the Cuban missile crisis the tapes reveal that Kennedy learned 
from the bay of pigs debacle a year earlier to trust his own instincts. 
He listens to a very wide dwroup of advisors suggesting things from 
ignoring the missiles on the one hand to invading and bombing Cuban 
on the other. Kennedy calls former President Eisenhower. What the 
tapes do not give us is Kennedy's own reflexes of how and why he made 
those decisions. He did not have a chance to record those thoughts 
the That's just a fraction of the 37 hours of tapes release today.
