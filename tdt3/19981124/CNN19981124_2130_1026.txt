Traveling during the holiday season can be crowded and stressful. 
But there are some opportunities that can be relaxing. Lori Waffenschmidt 
has the story in this edition of "working ahead." It's the season 
for shopping and holiday parties. But it's also an excellent time 
to wish upon a star. The period now, in November and early December, 
is an ideal time to visit any of the parks because the crowds are 
just not here. Lodging in the Orlando and Anaheim areas is likely 
to be more affordable, too. And who could say "bah, humbug" to theme 
parks immersed in holiday cheer? Early December is also the season 
for good deals, not to mention good golfing, in myrtle beach, South 
Carolina, and in business destinations like atlanta, Las Vegas and 
Chicago. Conventions and business travel don't take place during the 
holidays. The exception? The big apple. That's because there are a 
lot of conventions in town during that time, and everyone wants to 
go to New York to go shopping. If you'd like to escape the holidays 
and the crowds altogether, try the great outdoors. The national park 
service says just 4% of all the people who come to parks each year 
visit in December. But you'll need to call ahead to make sure some 
facilities aren't closed. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN.
