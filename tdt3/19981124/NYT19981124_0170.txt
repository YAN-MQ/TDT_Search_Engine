Maria Elena Buszek, self-described nerdy graduate student who reads 
comic books, recalls having a drink in a Chicago bar when her eyes 
were drawn to a pinup girl tattooed on the arm of the bartender. ``He 
slammed my bourbon down in front of me, and I grabbed his wrist and 
said, `That's a gorgeous Petty Girl.' He said, `Everybody thinks it's 
a Varga,' and I said, `No, there's a difference.''' That difference 
has been a consuming interest since 1994, shortly after Ms. Buszek 
arrived at the University of Kansas on a graduate fellowship in art 
history and learned that the university's Spencer Museum of Art was 
the repository of a matchless collection of the original airbrushed 
watercolors of pinup art published by Esquire magazine. The impossibly 
perfect females created by Alberto Vargas (editors at Esquire made 
him drop the ``s'' when signing his work because they thought it sounded 
like a possessive), George Petty and others accompanied American men 
through the depths of the Depression and to the battlefronts of World 
War II and Korea. Bob Hope was once quoted as saying, ``Our American 
troops are ready to fight at the drop of an Esquire.'' The issue of 
how to handle a collection that has the potential to embarrass a serious 
art museum but is admired by some people as magnificent art produces 
consternation and a touch of defensiveness among Ms. Buszek's elders 
at the helm of the Spencer, people with a little gray in their hair 
and sensibilities shaped by the 1960s and '70s. The question has come 
up off and on in the 18 years since Esquire donated its archives to 
the university, but it has acquired more currency with the rising 
prices such art brings at auctions and in galleries. Rough estimates 
indicate that the approximately 300 pinup pieces at the Spencer _ 
about half of them by Vargas _ may be worth $10 million to $20 million. 
Museum officials ask themselves whether to seek grants for a major 
exhibition of the material with scholarly analyses and a hundred color 
reproductions. Should they lend it to commercial galleries or let 
a Japanese aficionado mount a touring exhibition and _ Heaven forbid 
_ make a profit for both himself and the museum? Or should they keep 
it tucked away in its temperature- and light-controlled vault, available 
only for scholarly study? Stephen Goddard, senior curator of prints 
and drawings, who has primary responsibility for the collection, has 
maintained a policy of making it available not only to scholars but 
also to those who make pilgrimages to this campus atop the steep bluffs 
of the Kaw River. ``One family that came from California was in fashion 
design,'' he said. ``They were interested in Varga art from the standpoint 
of shoes and apparel. A number of people are interested in the art 
for design reasons. Some embroider it on leather jackets.'' Others, 
he noted, are into nostalgia and admire the Esquire Collection as 
the inspiration for pinups painted on the noses of aircraft in World 
War II. They are especially thrilled by the original of Petty's ``Memphis 
Belle,'' which adorned the noses of many bombers. One of the few times 
the Spencer lent its pinup art was for the opening of a new hangar 
at the Memphis Belle Museum. ``Some people see it as great art,'' 
Goddard said. ``One man said, `You want to tell me that Michelangelo 
was a great artist, but for me this is better.''' The Esquire pinups 
are also a major source of inspiration for tattoo artists and those 
who wear tattoos, like Simon Worman, a Lawrence man with a red-haired 
January 1946 Varga Girl tattooed on his left arm and another on his 
back. Worman, who plans to manage a new tattoo parlor in Lawrence, 
said he first went to the museum to look at some of the Varga Girls 
after buying a calendar with a reproduction of the January 1946 pinup 
and noticing that the Spencer Museum, just a block from his house, 
was credited as the source. What he and other visitors see are watercolors 
on paper varying in size from 15 by 20 inches to 26 by 39 inches, 
sometimes with traces of rubber cement and other elements used to 
prepare them for reproduction and printing. The first pinup Vargas 
did for Esquire, in 1940, depicts a woman with blond hair stretched 
out in bed in a short black nightgown talking on the telephone. Others 
show curvaceous young women in Navy blues or other kinds of military 
dress, including one as George Washington in flowing cape. Skin-tight 
short shorts and negligees are favored. A cowgirl in bright blue shorts 
brandishes two six-shooters. Many artists drew pinups for Esquire 
after it began publication in 1933 as a magazine aimed at affluent 
men with a taste for stylish clothes and beautiful women, but George 
Petty emerged from the pack early. By 1940, Esquire thought he was 
demanding too much money, so it brought in Alberto Vargas, a Peruvian-born 
artist who had already made a name drawing the stars of Florenz Ziegfeld's 
shows. Vargas left Esquire in 1946, put the ``s'' back on his last 
name, and did illustrations for other media, including Playboy in 
the 1960s. Louis Meisel, who owns the New York gallery bearing his 
name and who is co-author of ``The Great American Pinup,'' said the 
works by Vargas are probably worth from $10,000 to $75,000 each, those 
by Petty from $10,000 to $20,000, and the others $5,000 to $10,000 
each. ``This is a very, very hot and strong sector of American art,'' 
said Meisel, whose gallery (at 141 Prince Street) is having an exhibition 
of works by five pinup artists, including Vargas and Petty. (The show 
closes Saturday.) To the 27-year-old Ms. Buszek, Varga Girls _ she 
prefers them over the work of Petty _ are nothing short of feminist 
icons. In her ``third-wave feminist'' view, pinups are ``an all-purpose 
icon for the sassy, tough, punk-rock, sexy woman.'' The pinup, she 
argues, was a major weapon in World War II, a ``modern war goddess.'' 
Although she originally intended to do her doctoral dissertation on 
a ``dead European guy'' (the 19th-century Spanish artist Mariano Fortuny 
y Carbo), she now intends to analyze and defend pinup art from a feminist 
perspective. But Andrea Norris, the director of the Spencer Museum 
and a generation older, revealed something about the gap in thinking 
on the subject as she walked back and forth in front of a selection 
of the works that Goddard had hung on the walls of a prints study 
room. ``To think,'' she said with a tone of disbelief, ``these are 
the sort of figures that when I was 10 years old we aspired to be.'' 
The pinup art arrived at the University of Kansas in about 9 tons 
of material from the archives of Esquire, most of it camera-ready 
art for production use, all donated in 1980 after the magazine changed 
hands. Lee Young, a retired journalism professor who represented the 
university in dealings with the magazine, said Esquire executives 
selected the University of Kansas because of the journalism school's 
first-issue magazine collection and its designation as official repository 
for the Magazine Publishers Association. Young said that of the 40,000 
pieces in the gift, probably 38,000 were ``little bits of editorial 
art'' that are stored on campus. The other 2,000 or so pieces, including 
the pinup art, were turned over to the Spencer, which stores and maintains 
them and provides scholars the opportunity to peruse a card catalog 
of all of the material. In addition to the pinup art, the collection 
includes 31 photographs by Diane Arbus from the 1960s, among them 
shots of Blaze Starr in her living room; the aging Mae West in her 
frilly, pink bedroom, and Jayne Mansfield with her daughter. ``At 
the time,'' Young recalled, ``one of the people at Esquire said he 
hoped pieces of the famous art wouldn't show up hanging in deans' 
offices. I assured him that that would not happen.'' Part of the reason 
very little of the pinup art has even been seen hanging in the museum, 
Ms. Norris and Goddard said, is that there is no curator on staff 
who feels competent to deal with it. Ms. Norris specialized in Italian 
Renaissance sculpture when she earned her doctorate at New York University; 
Goddard's specialty is the Northern Renaissance and 16th-century history 
of prints. ``I could be the facilitator of a show based on the Esquire 
Collection,'' he said, ``but not the main essayist.'' Still, both 
seem willing to try to reach across the generational and cultural 
divides that separate them from the true fans of the Esquire Collection, 
including the two long-haired undergraduate men who confronted Ms. 
Norris at a recent reception and asked why a show was not being done 
about ``an important cultural figure like Vargas.'' ``There's no reason 
not to be comprehensive about what we permit ourselves to consider 
as art,'' Ms. Norris said. ``If you include illustration and design 
in art, then this falls in that category.'' Goddard said: ``It's art. 
There's no question about that. It's simply a matter of how one perceives 
it and wishes to interpret it. This work captures, in a maybe naive 
way, some of the preoccupations of mid-century America and allows 
us to revisit that time. It is much tamer than most people would imagine.''
