The International Monetary Fund is still critical of the Russian government's 
plans to tackle the country's economic crisis and is reluctant to 
release more loans, officials said Tuesday. Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov's Cabinet has been pushing the IMF to release the next installment 
of a frozen dlrs 22.6 billion aid package, saying it is crucial to 
pay off huge domestic and foreign debts. Russia is facing its worst 
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse following government default 
on loans in August and devaluation of the currency. The IMF team wrapped 
up a week of talks Tuesday after meeting with senior Cabinet officials 
and studying the government's 1999 budget estimates. ``The talks aren't 
over yet and no agreements have been reached,'' said First Deputy 
Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who met with the IMF mission on Wednesday. 
``They are studying us and we, them.'' The IMF is expected to come 
back to Moscow for more talks later this year. Maslyukov voiced hope 
that those talks will be successful, but said that the Fund remained 
dissatisfied with the budget plan and specifically urged the government 
to boost tax collection. ``We agree with that, but we can't go beyond 
the limits of what is possible,'' Maslyukov told reporters. The IMF 
disapproved of the government's plan to support ailing industries 
and insisted that state regulation of the economy should be minimal. 
The IMF believes that the ``the state intervention only brings harm, 
while the Russian Cabinet thinks that it should control the process,'' 
Maslyukov said, according to Russian news reports. Deputy Finance 
Minister Oleg Vyugin, who took part in the talks, said IMF experts 
also criticized the government's 1999 budget as not austere enough 
and its revenue forecast as overly optimistic. The IMF has urged the 
Russian Cabinet to start implementing a strict economic plan and put 
forward a realistic budget for next year as the main condition for 
more loans. Last month, 42 million Russians, or 29 percent of the 
population were living below the official poverty line of 644 rubles 
(just under dlrs 40) a month, compared to 31 million (21 percent) 
a year ago. Russia is also urging the IMF and other creditors to reschedule 
its foreign debt, which will require dlrs 17.5 billion to service 
next year. Meanwhile, the government has already included prospective 
IMF credits in next year's budget and deducted from it debt payments 
it hopes to reschedule _ an approach that drew the IMF's complaints, 
Vyugin said. Also Tuesday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said 
the government will issue new treasury bonds by Dec. 10 to replace 
those it froze in August, according to the Interfax news agency. The 
IMF and other foreign lenders have demanded that the Russian government 
reach an agreement with holders of the dlrs 40 billion worth of frozen 
treasury bills, or GKOs _ including several major foreign banks.
