In the press room of Yankee Stadium not long ago I saw Joe DiMaggio 
sitting at a table with a few friends. Even in repose he looked elegant, 
still trim in his dark suit, hair graying and thin but neatly coiffed. 
I was reminded of a remark by Henry Kissinger when he sat near DiMaggio 
in the owner's box in Yankee Stadium. The Yankees had lost a playoff 
game and Kissinger, on the way out, had said, ``Joe, put on a uniform 
_ they can use you.'' In the mind's eye, Joe still could lope after 
a fly ball. When I saw DiMaggio then, I related to him an unfortunate 
incident that happened to him some 45 years ago and which he didn't 
know about. I was a small boy growing up in Chicago in the 1950s, 
I told him, and aware of the DiMaggio legend, as was anyone else who 
followed baseball in America. I had written to the Yankees for a photograph 
of him, was sent a glossy head shot with him in his baseball cap, 
and nailed the picture to my bedroom wall. The unfortunate part, I 
told DiMaggio, was that I hammered the nail right through his forehead. 
``You did?'' he said, wincing. ``Looks like it's OK now,'' I said. 
``Oh yeah,'' he said. ``I heal fast.'' Wednesday marks DiMaggio's 
84th birthday, and one wonders if he can heal as he lies in a hospital 
in Hollywood, Fla., amid reports that he has been battling lung cancer 
as well as pneumonia. He is fighting for his life. One wonders whether 
the man who once hit in 56 straight big-league games, a record that 
has stood for 57 years, can summon the energy and, perhaps, the requisite 
miracle to regain health. Even before his admission to the hospital 
on Oct. 12, DiMaggio's name was in the news, in an indirect fashion. 
The Yankees' sterling center fielder, Bernie Williams, the American 
League's leading hitter and Gold Glove fly-chaser, heir to DiMaggio 
and Mickey Mantle, and a free agent, has been in controversial negotiations 
with the Yankees. Williams is as distinguished a ballplayer, if not 
as iconic, as his famous predecessors. It is difficult for fans to 
imagine that their athletic heroes are vulnerable to everything human. 
The youth of the ballplayer, or, sometimes, even the coach, is eternal, 
if only in photographs and film _ DiMaggio in his baggy pinstripes 
is still rapping out hits in his familiar long stride and sweeping 
stroke of the bat _ and in our memory. Red Holzman can still be seen 
in that fashion in the huddle, instructing Bradley and Frazier, and 
Weeb Ewbank may be forever visualized discussing strategy with a mud-splattered 
Joe Namath on the sidelines. In that sense, Coach Holzman of the New 
York Knicks and Coach Ewbank of the New York Jets, both who died recently, 
remain vital to us. And Catfish Hunter, because of the Lou Gehrig's 
disease he has, may soon lose such control in his muscles that he 
will be unable to even grip a baseball. Such thoughts seem to fall 
off the radar screen of our comprehension. And so it is with Joe D., 
that intensely proud man, that sometimes impatient and unforgiving 
man, who, the Yankee management knew, would be insulted if, at Old-Timers' 
Day, he should not be the last announced. On the day I apologized 
for pounding that nail into his head, I gave DiMaggio a photograph 
of him and Marilyn Monroe taken by Richard Sanborn, who is now a judicial 
magistrate living in Maryland. Sanborn had been a sergeant in the 
Army stationed in Tokyo in 1954 when DiMaggio and Monroe went on their 
honeymoon to Japan. I had done a column on DiMaggio and Sanborn sent 
the photo to me to give to DiMaggio, saying he had always wanted Joe 
to have it and didn't know how to get it to him. Would I do it? I 
did. As most people know, bringing up his former wife to DiMaggio 
would end any conversation with him. It was too personal. But I handed 
DiMaggio the photograph. He thought it was great. ``And this guy was 
just an amateur photographer?'' DiMaggio said. ``I've got to send 
him a note and thank him.'' Shortly after, alone with DiMaggio, I 
said, ``Marilyn looked beautiful in the picture.'' ``She was beautiful,'' 
DiMaggio said, as though relating an insight. I said, ``Joe, there's 
a question I've always wanted to ask you, if you don't mind.'' He 
nodded, knitting his brow. ``There's that great anecdote first written 
by Gay Talese,'' I went on, ``about when you were in Japan and Marilyn 
was asked by the brass to entertain the troops in Korea. When she 
returned to your hotel room, you asked how it went and she said, `Oh, 
Joe, you never heard such cheering!' And you said quietly, `Yes I 
have.' ``Did it happen?'' ``Yes,'' DiMaggio said, ``it did.''
