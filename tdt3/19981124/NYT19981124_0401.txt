Arlene Pacheco and her two children walked past Public School 9 on 
Brunswick Avenue here, where teachers were marching in a circle and 
carrying signs that said, ``Dignity, not Dollars.'' It was 9 a.m. 
and her children were not in school. ``Mommy, what are they doing?'' 
her 4-year-old daughter, Aja, asked. ``It's a strike, honey,'' her 
mother said. Her 5-year-old son, Xavier, who is in kindergarten at 
P.S. 42 and was holding her hand, said he knew what a strike was: 
``A strike is when a kid can't go to school anymore.'' For Xavier 
and many of the district's 32,000 other children, that is exactly 
what a teachers' strike, now in its fourth day, has meant. District 
officials said that 65 percent to 70 percent of the students were 
absent from school Tuesday, about the same as the day before. Some 
parents staying home to watch their children, sometimes at the risk 
of losing their jobs. Some are hiring baby sitters they can barely 
afford, or are enlisting neighbors and relatives to help out during 
a strike with no end in sight. ``It really is affecting all of us,'' 
Ms. Pacheco said. ``A lot of parents are not able to go to work, or 
they have to find a baby sitter at the last minute. And the kids are 
not getting an education.'' But in spite of the hardship, Ms. Pacheco, 
like many parents, was on the teachers' side. ``Yes, I am supporting 
them, very much,'' she said. Jersey City is a school district of working-class 
parents, where many teachers have been in the system so long they 
are now teaching the children of their old students. Many parents 
feel a loyalty to the teachers. And while low test scores and other 
failings prompted the state to take over the schools here a decade 
ago, teachers and school officials say there has been some improvement 
in test scores in recent years. ``I think the teachers do a hell of 
a job,'' said Juan Bonilla, whose son attends P.S. 34, and who shouted 
his support to the striking teachers he passed on Brunswick Avenue. 
``I think they ought to give them everything they want.'' The district 
has canceled classes in all five high schools since the strike's second 
day. The elementary schools, pre-kindergarten to eighth grade, have 
been on a half-day schedule, inconveniencing parents. District representatives 
and the Jersey City Teachers Association, which represents 2,500 teachers 
and 1,000 support workers, reported making some pogress in overnight 
talks that ended early Tuesday. In Hudson County Superior Court Tuesday, 
Judge Martin Greenberg ordered the teachers to return to work on Monday 
morning or lose their jobs. The judge also ruled that starting this 
week the union would face a fine of $100,000 for each day of the strike, 
or $200,000 thus far. But he rejected the district's plea that teachers 
be fined two days' pay for every day they remained on strike and that 
union leaders be fined $1,000 a day each. Many parents are choosing 
not to send their children to school because they do not believe much 
learning is going on. Others, like Ms. Pacheco, said that the chaos 
and near-riots at some schools on Thursday, the first day of the strike, 
made them decide their children would be safer at home than at school. 
Both fears can be traced to the fact that district officials found 
fewer than 200 substitute teachers to supervise the district's students 
in 39 schools. ``I saw police and I saw the rioting,'' Ms. Pacheco 
said, recalling the scene on Thursday morning, when she walked her 
son to P.S. 42. ``I was afraid to leave my son. The kids were running 
up and down the streets. It was chaos.'' To keep him home, Ms. Pacheco 
has had to be absent from her job as a sales clerk at a mall. ``As 
a result of this, I may lose my job,'' she said. ``But maybe because 
I've been a good employee, they'll let me come back when this is all 
over.'' While most parents interviewed sided with the teachers, some 
were not sympathetic. ``They're getting paid how much?'' asked Mercedes 
Colon, as she left her 7-year-old son at P.S. 9 before she rushed 
off to her job as a home health attendant. ``I wish I made half as 
much as they do.'' Mrs. Colon said that because of the trouble in 
the schools the first two days of the strike, she kept her son out 
of school, and took him with her one day to her job tending to old 
people in their homes. ``But imagine, those are sick people, so how 
can I keep taking him?'' she said. ``I tried hard to find somebody 
to help me out, but so far I haven't.''
