Postal officials in Washington state are struggling to restore customer 
confidence in mailboxes. It seems thieves in the Seattle area duplicated 
the master key for those blue, street-side mailboxes and stole credit 
cards and checks from all over town. The post office added padlocks 
as a temporary solution, and new mailboxes with better locks are being 
installed. One problem that hasn't been solved yet, the forged master 
key also opens about 35,000 apartment mailboxes in the region.
