A new police chief was sworn in Tuesday in Milan, a day after the 
city's top cop was arrested on murder charges in the 1995 slaying 
of a smuggling suspect in southern Italy. Moving quickly to restore 
confidence in the police after the stunning arrest, the Interior Ministry 
named Giovanni Finazzo, 56, to replace Francesco Forleo, who is now 
in a military prison on murder charges. Finazzo was the police of 
Catania in Sicily until his promotion to the Milan post. In documents 
published by newspapers Tuesday, prosecutors describe Forleo as the 
``nastiest of all gunmen.'' They accuse him of killing a smuggler 
with a rifle and hand grenades during a high speed chase in 1995. 
Forleo was in a police helicopter and the smuggler was in a boat. 
Forleo was the police chief of Brindisi, a port city in southern Italy 
at the time. He has said he fired in self-defense and was cleared 
in an earlier inquiry. But prosecutors now say Forleo wanted the suspect 
dead because he feared the man would expose police complicity with 
smugglers. News reports suggest the smugglers paid Forleo and his 
men for their protection. Forleo, who was once a top police union 
official and later served two terms in parliament, was one of Italy's 
more prominent law enforcement officers. He was arrested in Rome Monday, 
just hours after being summoned to the Interior Ministry and tendering 
his resignation. Five police officers who served in Brindisi under 
Forleo were arrested earlier in connection with the slaying.
