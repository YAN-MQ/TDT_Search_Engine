In Russia today, the largest outpouring of public grief in a long 
time. People today said they genuinely felt the grief. Thousands of 
people turned out for the funeral of the liberal politician of galina 
staravoirova whose assassination last week stunned the country. Here's 
ABC's Jim Wooten. No one quite expected this, this outpouring of grief 
for Galina staravoirova, but she was no ordinary politician. And in 
the new Russia, these days, her funeral was no ordinary farewell. 
Thousands waited hours in the bitter cold to praise her life, to mourn 
her death. "All our hope is in people like her," she says. Inside, 
her fell low liberals and reformers remembered her remembered here 
as a clear voice for democracy, an enemy of extremists. They are murdering 
our friends, said Anatoly Chubais, a former deputy prime minister, 
and like her, a reformer. They want to scare us. It won't work. What 
isn't clear is who they are. Such murders are almost common place 
here with a variety of suspects behind them, including organized crime. 
Few are ever solved. What's different in this case is the response. 
Her death seems to have sent shockwaves through a country thought 
to be hardened to such violence. "I've been crying for three days 
she says. I remember the day when John Kennedy was assassinated, and 
I had the same feeling. At her grave, near those of Dostoyevsky and 
Tchaikovsky, her friends and family said good-bye. Her son called 
her legacy trust, a rare political commodity during her life. There 
is less now that she is dead. Jim Wooten, ABC News, Moscow.
