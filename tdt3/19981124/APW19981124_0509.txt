An Iranian government official condemned the attack on a bus carrying 
American tourists, saying visitors to Iran were entitled to protection. 
Assailants, chanting ``Death to America,'' used stones and metal bars 
Saturday to smash the windows of a bus carrying a group of 13 foreigners, 
mostly Americans, after hard-line newspapers accused them of being 
spies. ``This kind of behavior is unacceptable to the government,'' 
Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh was quoted Tuesday as saying 
in the Iran News. ``Any person who has entered the country legally 
is entitled to protection,'' he was quoted as telling the newspaper. 
On Monday, U.S. officials in Washington denied any of the visiting 
Americans were government officials or had links to the CIA. The group 
left Iran on Sunday. The Fedayeen Islam, a radical Muslim group largely 
dormant since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, claimed responsibility 
for the bus attack in a statement Monday. ``This was an operation 
against U.S. spies and a warning to the officials who invited them,'' 
said the statement, apparently referring to President Mohammad Khatami's 
call for cultural exchanges between Americans and Iranians. Tajzadeh 
also condemned the murder earlier this week of an Iranian opposition 
figure and his wife. ``The government is obliged to provide security 
for all the country's citizens. The lives of the people must be protected, 
even if they are our opponents,'' the paper quoted Tajzadeh as saying. 
Dariush Foruhar and his wife were found stabbed to death at their 
Tehran home Sunday. Foruhar was the leader of the People's Party of 
Iran, a small opposition group that is tolerated by the government. 
Khatami today asked the Interior Ministry to form a committee to investigate 
Foruhar's death and bring his killers to justice, Iranian radio reported.
