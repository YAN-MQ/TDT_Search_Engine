The bears are on the run in the European market, and the bulls in 
Asia. Time for business news. And, here's Les Carpenter. That's a 
pretty good description. Thank you very much. Stocks in Europe opened 
higher, but have now turned lower. The German Deutsch 's down 25 points, 
the Paris cap up 21, the Swiss market index down 74, the London footsie, 
100, down 54 points.
