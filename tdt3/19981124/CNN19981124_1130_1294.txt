Last night, drew Bledsoe led a heroic charge to lift New England over 
Miami 26-23. Playing with a fractured finger on his throwing hand, 
Bledsoe hit Shawn jefferson with 29 seconds left to pull the Patriots 
to within a game of the aFC east lead. We're 5-6 instead of 6-5 right 
now. I main, it's hard to ask people to continue to support us in 
that situation. This is a huge win for the fans, the team, the organization, 
for everybody.
