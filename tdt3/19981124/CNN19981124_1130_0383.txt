Forecasters say another strong storm will hit the pacific northwest 
today. Wind gusts of nearly 90 miles per hour yesterday blew roofs 
off buildings and cut power to tens of thousands in the Portland, 
Oregon, area. Thousands more lost electricity in Washington state. 
Heavy rain and several inches of snow hampered travel. The California 
highway patrol shut 24 miles of interstate 80 because of whiteout 
conditions. The storm caused at least one death.
