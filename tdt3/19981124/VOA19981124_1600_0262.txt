With a flourish of pomp and circumstance, Lebanon's new president, 
General Anil Lahud, took office Tuesday before the country's parliament. 
General Lahud, commander of the Lebanese army since 1989, is the country's 
11th president since independence from France in 1943. Edward Uranian 
reports from Beirut. General Lahud, whose family has a long history 
of serving the Lebanese state, pledged before parliament to defend 
the country's independence and territorial sovereignty. He quickly 
insisted, however, that Lebanon's strength resided in its close cooperation 
with Syria, offering words of praise for Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. 
Syria has 35,000 troops stationed across much of the country. General 
Lahud also criticized Israel for refusing to withdraw from southern 
Lebanon in accordance with U.N. Resolution 425. Lebanon will negotiate 
together with Syria, he added, to obtain a complete Israeli withdrawal 
from southern Lebanon and the Golan Heights. The new president, who 
built a reputation for honesty and integrity during nine years as 
commander of the Lebanese army, concluded his address to parliament 
by insisting that no one is above the law. Edward Uranian, VOA News, 
Beirut.
