A federal judge has ruled that public libraries offering Internet 
access cannot block pornographic web sites from their computers. The 
judge says installing software that searches for sexual words is a 
Violation of the constitutional right to free expression. She contends 
libraries don't have to offer the Internet at all, but if they do, 
they must find alternatives that don't infringe on adult rights. The 
judge cited several alternatives, including using different terminals 
for children and adults.
