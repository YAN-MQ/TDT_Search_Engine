The heads of Europe's national soccer federations discussed the proposed 
new structure for UEFA's club competitions Tuesday but failed to agree 
on the nitty-gritty of when and how to proceed. It will now be up 
to UEFA's Executive Committee to pronounce on whether to start the 
planned new Champions League and merged UEFA Cup next year or in the 
year 2000, said UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner. If the executive 
committee decides in December on a 2000 start rather than 1999, ``I 
think the clubs would have to live with it,'' Aigner told reporters 
at the end of a special UEFA meeting. Last month, representatives 
of major clubs agreed not to join a breakaway Super League after the 
European governing body proposed changing its Champions League, offering 
teams more money. UEFA promised to expand next season's Champions 
League from 24 teams to 32 clubs, playing in eight groups of four 
teams in the first stage. It also proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and 
Cup Winners Cup into one competition, called the UEFA Cup. Top clubs 
want the new competitions to begin next season to maximize their potential 
earnings. ``There were some reservations about an early start,'' at 
Tuesday's meeting, Aigner said. UEFA stressed that both revamped competitions 
would have to start the same year. The 17 dates needed to stage the 
new-look Champions League in an already tight season could prove a 
problem for some of Europe's larger leagues. UEFA presented to associations 
two alternatives for the new UEFA Cup, one of which would see eight 
teams who didn't qualify from their Champions League group joining 
the competition in its third round. ``The feedback that we get is 
overwhelmingly positive for that move,'' Aigner said. Richer associations 
favored a group stage in the UEFA Cup, but smaller associations backed 
a straight knockout format, he added. In other business, UEFA's member 
associations agreed on a memorandum backing UEFA regulations to prevent 
two or more clubs owned by the same company from taking part in the 
same European club competition. In July, the Court of Arbitration 
for Sport provisionally suspended the regulation, ruling that UEFA 
hadn't given clubs enough time to adjust when it was introduced in 
May. The ruling came in response to an arbitration request from Greek 
club AEK Athens and Czech club Slavia Prague, both controlled by British 
company ENIC. The associations ``reaffirm our unqualified support 
for the UEFA rule, and the sporting principles which underlie it,'' 
the statement said. The federation heads also agreed to lobby the 
European Union for an antitrust exemption to allow UEFA to centrally 
market television rights. ``Unless a means to redistribute income 
is recognized, there is a real danger that the existing disparities 
between the rich and poor will become a yawning gulf,'' they said 
in a memorandum. ``The marketing of competition matches by individual 
clubs will inevitably disrupt the league structure, as investors would 
focus only on the best teams,'' they added.
