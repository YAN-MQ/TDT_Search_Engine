Except for the putting green with water hazards, the 60 television 
monitors and aisles that look more like cart paths, the PGA Tour Stop 
would seem like any other department store. It doesn't take long to 
realize that it's not. Inside the two-story building that sits across 
from the World Golf Hall of Fame is an electronic leaderboard that 
gives up-to-minute results of tournaments halfway around the globe. 
Three miniature replicas of famous golf holes are set in the tile 
and covered by a thick slab of glass on the ground floor, where clothing 
lines such as Liz Claiborne, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger and Polo have their 
own departments. The Titleist department is on the second floor, complete 
with the bags of touring pros David Duval and Dottie Pepper _ hers 
has the picture of a chow stitched in gold. Across the way and out 
the patio door are five driving stations, where shoppers can try out 
equipment from Callaway, Taylor Made, Ping and other major manufacturers. 
Any questions? Meet Kevin Perrigo, one of the employees. He can tell 
you the difference between graphite and steel, custom-fit you for 
clubs and then provide swing tips you can only get from a teaching 
pro _ because he is one. Clearly, this is no ordinary department store. 
``It's like a PGA merchandise show that's open for 365 days a year,'' 
said Perrigo, one of two Class A teaching pros on staff. ``Only here, 
you can actually buy things.'' That's what the PGA Tour had in mind 
when it licensed W.C. Bradley Co. to run its first retail store, a 
shrine to shopping in the World Golf Village. ``I've tried to describe 
it as the ultimate retail experience for golfers and non-golfers alike,'' 
said Chris Martin, executive vice president of W.C. Bradley. ``What 
we want to do is create an entertaining and educational environmental 
with the highest line of qualify products you could ever find under 
one roof.'' The Tour Stop brings together every major company that 
sells golf goods _ clothing, clubs, shoes, balls, books, furniture, 
paintings, video games, bags _ all under one very large roof. The 
store at the World Golf Village is the flagship. Others are planned 
in either major markets (New York, Chicago) or golf markets (Las Vegas, 
Palm Springs). ``Most of the golf manufacturers are not retailers,'' 
said Leo McCullagh, vice president of retail licensing and consumer 
marketing for the PGA Tour. ``They didn't want to have to operate 
this, so part of our mission was to find somebody who would operate 
for them and allow them a chance to do their branding.'' That goes 
for the PGA Tour, as well, which is on a brand-building mission. Retail 
is simply one more way to bring people into golf, whether through 
fashion or furniture, video games or paintings that come with authentic 
scorecards signed by a tournament champion. ``The more people we can 
touch and have associated with our sport, the more people we're attracting 
to the game,'' McCullagh said. For the most part, apparel can be found 
among the lower level. Ashworth, Cutter and Buck and Izod Club are 
divided into ``concept shops,'' where each has its own identity. The 
most popular department belongs to FootJoy, which has a three-dimensional, 
computerized Laser Fitting System that can't be found in any other 
store in the world. ``I think it's worked out terrific,'' said Christine 
Kasper, public relations and advertising director for the Greg Norman 
Collection, which occupies one of the prime corner locations in the 
Tour Stop. ``You would think with so many vendors it would look kind 
of choppy, but everyone is able to keep within their brand identity,'' 
she said. ``If it was just a shop and no one had any identity, it 
would just be a lot of stuff. This is laid out in a smart way.'' Upstairs 
are the equipment manufacturers. Titleist, Ping, Callaway and Taylor 
Made anchor the four corners, with Orlimar and Adams fairway metals, 
Cleveland wedges and Cobra among those with sections linking it all 
together. ``Golf has always been five to 10 years behind other products,'' 
said Steve Bostwick, the marketing product manager for Ping. ``It 
has finally reached where it should be in merchandising.'' Finding 
something to buy is not a problem; neither is finding something to 
do. W.C. Bradley, a Georgia company that has been privately owned 
for 113 years, thinks customers must be not only educated on the goods 
available but also entertained. ``The whole idea was to get someone 
in there and to stay in our store for more than 15 minutes,'' Martin 
said. ``And to do that with a wide variety of shopping. We have the 
putting green, interactive areas where people can play the video games, 
the club demonstration area.'' The store has only been open 10 days, 
but Martin already has surveyed some shoppers from the minute they 
walked in the door to the minute they walked out _ two hours later. 
``I think we're accomplishing what we wanted,'' he said.
