An economist testifying on behalf of the government in its antitrust 
suit against the Microsoft Corp. sat through another day of hostile 
cross-examination Tuesday, but Microsoft's lawyer failed to budge 
him from his opinions. Michael Lacovara, the Microsoft lawyer who 
questioned Frederick Warren-Boulton for a third day Tuesday, at one 
point referred him to a treatise that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates 
had written in 1996 about the Internet and personal computers. ``Microsoft's 
approach is to make Windows so Internet friendly that no one will 
want a separate browser,'' Gates wrote. ``Our goal is to meld the 
best of the PC with the best of the Web, creating a single world of 
great promise.'' When Lacovara asked Warren-Boulton if he had any 
problem with that, the witness said the result would be ``a world 
of great promise _ to Microsoft.'' So it went through the day. The 
court adjourned for a Thanksgiving break, and Warren-Boulton was to 
take the stand again Monday morning. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson, clearly impatient with the slow pace of this cross-examination, 
admonished Lacovara that he expected him to finish on Monday. Lacovara 
promised to work through the weekend cutting his questions. With an 
impish smile, Warren-Boulton asked: ``Would you like some help?'' 
Warren-Boulton is an important witness in the sense that the government 
wants him to lay the factual foundation for the its case _ that Microsoft 
is in fact a monopoly, meaning that the antitrust laws do apply. Microsoft's 
approach appears to be to challenge him in so many areas that he will 
end up making one or two statements, inadvertently or otherwise, that 
Microsoft can use against him. For example, after Lacovara questioned 
the witness for a full day on Monday, Mark Murray, Microsoft's spokesman, 
stood on the courthouse steps and declared: ``The government's own 
witness, under oath, said he saw nothing wrong with Netscape adding 
new features to its Web browser, even back when Netscape had a dominant 
share of the browser market. ``The government is offering a double 
standard here _ one standard for Netscape and another for Microsoft.'' 
That resulted from an off-hand observation Warren-Boulton had made 
on the stand that Netscape had added features and additional small 
applications to its World Wide Web browser over the years. Once again, 
America Online's acquisition of Netscape Communications worked its 
way into the trial. Microsoft eagerly asserted that the deal was sufficient 
grounds for the government to drop its lawsuit. To that, David Boies, 
the government's lead attorney said: ``That's about the sixth time 
during this trial that Microsoft has declared that the government's 
case is dead. The government has no intention to withdraw the case, 
and I think Microsoft knows that.'' In his eagerness to embrace the 
deal as part of Microsoft's defense, Lacovara overstepped at one point, 
asking a question based on the assertion that Sun Microsystems, Microsoft's 
arch competitor, would, as Lacovara put it, acquire Netscape's Web 
browser as part of the transaction. Startled by that, Jackson leaned 
forward in his chair and asked, ``Is that really the case?'' Lacovara 
assured him that it was. ``It was reported on MSNBC this morning,'' 
he explained. But it was inaccurate. As part of the three-way deal, 
Sun Microsystems will distribute Netscape's business-level server 
software for three years. America Online will maintain control of 
Netscape's Web browser.
