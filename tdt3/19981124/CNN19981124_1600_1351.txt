My dad always said: as soon as I get a computer you'll come out with 
something better. So, to make sure people like dad have the latest 
computer we invented your:)ware-- technology that grows with you. 
For just $49.95 a month you can buy a computer with an Intel Pentium 
II processor Internet access and in two years you can trade it in 
towards the purchase of a new one. What do you call this thing? Your:)ware. 
Call 1-800-gateway and let's talk about your:)ware.
