Hutu rebels killed 24 people in two attacks in northwestern Burundi, 
state-run radio said Tuesday. Rebels killed 23 people and wounded 
20, 13 of them seriously, in an attack overnight Sunday on Gihungwe 
village, 20 kilometers (nearly 15 miles) northwest of the capital, 
the report said. They also burned down 114 homes. A teacher was killed 
in another attack in nearby Buringa, the report said. More than 200,000 
people have been killed since 1993 when the violence erupted after 
Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's first democratically elected 
president, a Hutu, in a failed coup. Negotiations under the auspices 
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere have failed to end the violence. 
Hutus comprise 85 percent of Burundi's population of 6.2 million, 
while Tutsis make up 14 percent.
