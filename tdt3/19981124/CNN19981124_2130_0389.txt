The holiday shopping season is here and researchers are warning parents 
about buying potentially fatal toys. The U.S. public interest research 
group says the worst ones are balloons and toys with small parts that 
children can choke on. It has released "trouble in toyland," a report 
that names 24 dangerous toys. It says some of them violate federal 
standards for small parts. Children are still needlessly choking to 
death on dangerous toys that can still be found on toy shelves. Parents 
must remember that the government does not test all toys. Just because 
a toy appears on the shelf does not mean that it is safe. The group 
also listed several toys it says can be toxic. They include -- the 
baby looney tunes cooling ring teether, funny face teether rattle, 
part of the Disney babies Mickey collection and toteables glow in 
the dark fashion accessories.
