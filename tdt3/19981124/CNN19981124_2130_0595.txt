President Clinton issued a presidential pardon today for a Turkey. 
The Thanksgiving bird was on the receiving end of an annual White 
House tradition. President Harry truman began offering the presidential 
pardon 51 years ago. Mr. Clinton says the Turkey will spend the rest 
of his days at a Virginia petting zoo surrounded by friends, not peas 
and sweet potatoes.
