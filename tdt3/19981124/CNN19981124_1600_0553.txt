The economic crisis in Asia which threatens other world economies 
isn't just about financial markets and business pressures. Ian Williams 
looks at another face of the problem on the streets of Tokyo. This 
is the human face of Japan's recession. The homeless are among those 
living rough on the streets of Tokyo. They've been living this way 
since they arrived looking for work and with winter approaching they 
see little prospect of a job or a home. While kuhnio has been here 
for two weeks, maruiki has been homeless for six months. He's two 
too ashamed to ask his family for help or even tell them of his plight. 
He once ran his own business and still carries a briefcase in the 
increasingly vain hope of finding a job. They've received little sympathy 
from the local authorities who have given this little community three 
days to move on or be evicted. Hundreds of homeless now live in shelters 
along Tokyo's river. The authorities say they don't keep figures, 
but they acknowledge the problem's worse than at any time since Tokyo 
was emerging from the rubble of the second world war. Until recently 
the poor in Japan were a good deal better off than the poor in Britain 
or America. There were few visible signs of hardship. But the emergence 
of so many homeless is fast shattering any illusions about the depths 
of the recession here. The reality of recession has always seemed 
a long way from the glittering streets of Tokyo. But tonight those 
streets are home to kuhnio, and a rapidly growing number of desperate 
and destitute people, and their numbers can only grow as japan's economic 
crisis continues to bite. Ian Williams, channel 4 news, Tokyo.
