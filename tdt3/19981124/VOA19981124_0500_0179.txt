the un Security Council is expected, today, to take up the latest 
dispute between Iraq and Chief UN Weapons Inspector, Richard Butler. 
Iraq sent a letter to the council Monday, complaining Mr. Butler's 
demanding documents that Baghdad says are non-existent, are irrelevant, 
or would jeopardize national security. Deputy Prime Minister Nzarham 
Duen says Iraq is complying. The question of pushing and of putting 
pressure on Iraq to try to get that document, has really gone beyond 
the professional and the technical job that Ascomb is trying to accomplish. 
The United States and Britain say Iraq has not demonstrated full cooperation 
and this could delay any comprehensive review of Iraq's disarmament 
efforts.
