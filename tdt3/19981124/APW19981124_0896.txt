Lawyers for President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday appealed a court ruling 
that quashed a government investigation of racism and mismanagement 
in rugby. Mandela is seeking a judgement from the Constitutional Court, 
South Africa's highest legal body. The ongoing battle about the sport, 
once heralded as a way of uniting South Africa's races, has caused 
divisions in the country. The South African Rugby Union had gone to 
court to block the government's investigation, dragging the president 
to the witness stand. Many blacks felt that was a deliberate attempt 
by the white-dominated sport to humiliate South Africa's first black 
president. That impression deepened after Judge William de Villiers 
ruled in favor of the rugby league and rebuked Mandela for insolence 
during his testimony. De Villiers was appointed a judge under the 
apartheid regime that ended with 1994's first all-race election of 
Mandela as president. Lawyer Wim Trengove told a panel of Constitutional 
Court judges that de Villier's judgment was invalid, and asked them 
to consider the case because it involved constitutional matters. But 
lawyer Mike Maritz, who represented SARFU and its former head, Louis 
Luyt, argued that the case should be heard by the Appeal Court in 
Bloemfontein, the next highest court. The Constitutional Court on 
Tuesday delayed judgement about accepting the case until a later date. 
Luyt resigned from SARFU under the pressure of outcry over his decision 
to take Mandela to court. Rugby has vast support among Afrikaners, 
the Dutch-descended settlers who dominated apartheid governments and 
still maintain a stranglehold on most professional teams. Blacks grew 
to hate the sport during the apartheid era, associating it with the 
white minority. But Mandela tried to use rugby to promote racial reconciliation 
after he took power and urged blacks to support the victorious national 
team in the 1995 World Cup.
