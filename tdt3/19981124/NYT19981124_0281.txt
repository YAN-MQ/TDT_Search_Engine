Less than a month after he swept into office with a ready smile and 
talk of a ``new middle'' that would revitalize Germany, Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder has lost much of the momentum and good will that 
propelled his ascent. Sniped at by state premiers who wield much power 
in Germany's decentralized system, criticized by his Green coalition 
partners, attacked by leading businessmen and buffeted within his 
own Social Democratic Party, Schroeder has appeared unable to impose 
his stamp on the government. ``There is no need to panic,'' Peter 
Struck, leader of the Social Democratic Party in Parliament, said 
Tuesday, but the admonition itself clearly reflected mounting concern. 
Heide Ruhle, party manager of the environmentalist Greens, declared 
that Germany ``cannot be governed by the troops of chaos.'' At a time 
when German companies are on a self-confident buying spree in the 
United States _ Deutsche Bank's impending purchase of Banker's Trust 
follows Daimler's acquisition of Chrysler and Bertelsmann's absorption 
of Random House _ this political uncertainty may appear out of character. 
But the reality of Germany today is a streamlined and aggressive corporate 
sector, acutely aware of the challenges of the global economy, alongside 
an uncertain social and political model that Schroeder has vowed to 
galvanize. In part, Schroeder's difficulties stem from teething problems 
that are inevitable, given the Social Democrats' 16-year absence from 
power and their coalition government with the Greens, which was widely 
regarded as unlikely before the September elections. ``They were not 
prepared at all, nothing was prepared, and then the program was put 
together in haste,'' said Claus Leggewie, a sociologist close to the 
government. ``It does look kind of amateurish.'' But at a deeper level, 
Schroeder seems to be suffering from the very ambiguities of his campaign. 
While his ability to appear both as an energetic modernizer and a 
traditional Social Democrat sensitive to workers' concerns was effective 
at election rallies, it seems to be proving too wide a stretch for 
government. Tensions in the Social Democratic Party burst into the 
open with the recent publication of a blunt letter to Schroeder from 
Wolfgang Clement, the Social Democratic premier of North Rhine-Westphalia 
state, which has a huge economy itself with a population larger than 
that of the Netherlands. Clement said tax reforms proposed by the 
government were inadequate and would do nothing to reduce unemployment, 
now running at more than 10 percent. He said government plans to close 
tax loopholes for corporations and raise energy taxes would cost businesses 
about $17.8 billion; he suggested slashing the corporate income tax 
level to below 30 percent from more than 40 percent, and lowering 
top tax rates for individuals. The thrust of his argument, which is 
also that of big business, was that only a deregulation of Germany's 
economy will spur corporations to create jobs. Clement's letter revealed 
the extent of the chasm between reformist Social Democrats like Clement 
and Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, who has focused more on the 
widening gap between rich and poor in Germany, the need to spur growth 
through cutting interest rates and the possibility of creating jobs 
through a state-sponsored ``alliance for jobs'' that would bring together 
labor unions and industry leaders. For the moment, Schroeder, whose 
essential political talent is that of an effective communicator, at 
once polished and unruffled, has appeared to want to remain above 
the fray. This policy of aloofness may spare him the worst of the 
vitriol flying between the wings of his party, but at some point it 
appears inevitable that the chancellor will have to intervene more 
forcefully or face growing criticism for indecisiveness.
