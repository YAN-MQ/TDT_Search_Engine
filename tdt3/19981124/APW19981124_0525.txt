Thanks to a million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) from the Welsh actor 
Sir Anthony Hopkins and hundreds of other public donations, the National 
Trust announced Tuesday that it has completed the purchase of 4,000 
acres (1,620 hectares) of Wales' highest mountain. The National Trust, 
a charity that protects much of Britain's natural and historic heritage, 
raised the total 3.65 million pounds (dlrs 5.8 million) price tag 
for Mount Snowdon 10 days ahead of a deadline set for the property 
to go on the open market. It will be a national park, open to the 
public. ``We intend ... to sensitively manage the estates and ensure 
access forever,'' said Peter Broomhead, the trust's director for Wales, 
who shook hands on the deal with the seller, farmer Richard Williams. 
The trust said money is still pouring into the appeal fund. Any cash 
left over will be used to maintain the land and its buildings. The 
purchase price also includes sheep which graze the area. Hopkins, 
who was born in Port Talbot, Wales, is chairman of the trust's Snowdonia 
Appeal, which raises money for protection of the land it already owns. 
The case was due to continue Wednesday.
