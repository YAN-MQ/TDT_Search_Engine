Attorney general Janet Reno's decision not to appoint an independent 
counsel to investigate Al Gore and case of is clearly good news for 
the vice president. But what will this mean for his political future? 
"New York Times" national political correspondent Rick Berke has been 
considering that question for an article appearing in tomorrow's paper. 
Hi, Rick. Hey, jodi, how are you? Pretty well. The question is how 
is Al Gore doing? Does he emerge from this unscathed? He's doing great. 
They assure me they're not popping champagne at the White House tonight 
because they don't want to look too excited but this certainly is 
good for Al Gore and it comes at a perfect time for him because come 
January he's going to start officially raising money for his presidential 
run. He's got to raise something like $50 million next year for his 
campaign. And can you imagine if this investigation was proceeding 
how much more difficult it would be for him to call donors and to 
get them to fork over money when this cloud of an investigation would 
be hanging over them? So it really comes at a good time when he's 
about to start raising money in earnest. Does any democrat dare challenge 
Al Gore for the nomination now or is he unbeatable? He looks less 
beatable today than he did yesterday or this morning but who knows? 
I don't know if any one candidate would make a decision to challenge 
or take him on based on this but I certainly think he would look like 
more of a target if there were this investigation going on because 
if a special counsel had been picked this could have gone on for months 
or years even and distracted the vice president, discouraged fundraising. 
I mean it would have been a real mess for Al Gore. Sort of the biggest 
millstone preventing him from sort of a easier track to the nomination. 
So I think this is a real relief for Al Gore and will cause potential 
rivals to think twice. This file tape of Al Gore at the Buddhist temple 
may be the biggest millstone now as we all have it in our files. And 
Al Gore's not going to be able to live down that appearance or the 
press conference last March where he talked about "no controlling 
legal authority" and looked stiff and awkward. Those are going to 
play again and again through the rest of his political career, I'm 
afraid. Thanks fetch for vucking with us tonight, Rick Berke
