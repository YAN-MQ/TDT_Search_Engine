Armed with detailed letters to and from Iraq, the Security Council 
met Tuesday for their first in-depth discussion of Baghdad's reluctance 
to hand over documents sought by the chief U.N. weapons inspector. 
Richard Butler was attending the meeting as well, but it wasn't known 
if he would be pressed to explain his requests. Last week, he sent 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz three letters seeking papers _ personal 
diaries, official memos and minutes from meetings among others _ in 
one of the first tests of Iraq's pledge to resume full cooperation 
with U.N. inspectors. Baghdad has balked at turning over the papers, 
arguing in three separate letters that they don't exist, were already 
shown to inspectors or had no relevance to the work of Butler's U.N. 
Special Commission, responsible for disarming Iraq of its weapons 
of mass destruction. The council won't lift sanctions imposed after 
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait until inspectors report that Baghdad's 
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and missiles have been destroyed. 
Although the United States and Britain have said military airstrikes 
are still an option, U.S. officials seem willing to wait to assess 
the full scope of Iraq's cooperation before deciding how to proceed. 
``As far as the U.S. is concerned, we have no doubts at all that these 
are important documents, and we would hope and expect that the Iraqis 
would cooperate and supply them,'' Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh 
said Monday. He rejected suggestions that Butler may have asked for 
too much, too soon from Iraq, which only narrowly avoided U.S. and 
British airstrikes by agreeing on Nov. 14 to reverse its decision 
and resume cooperation with inspectors. ``I am both personally and 
officially sure that UNSCOM wouldn't have asked for documents that 
it didn't need, that weren't important to its work in verifying the 
disarmament process in Iraq,'' he said. Other council members, however, 
said they would try to use the meeting to determine whether Butler's 
requests, and Baghdad's responses were appropriate. ``We want to make 
sure that what we are discussing is based on fact,'' said Sergey Lavrov 
of Russia, which generally takes a more sympathetic line towards Iraq. 
The council has promised Iraq a review of its efforts to dismantle 
the weapons programs _ which Baghdad hopes will ease sanctions _ but 
has said it will only do so after inspectors report that they have 
received full cooperation in their work.
