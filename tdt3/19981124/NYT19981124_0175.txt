He was the Peter Pan and Ariel of wine; a man who described one of 
his own commentaries as ``a critique of pure riesling,'' and who advised 
on a label that ``this wine will accommodate all manner of game and 
wild beasts, including the sloth.'' No, Randall Grahm _ for who else 
could it be _ has not left us. But he has gone, as they say here in 
the land of carrot juice and the flapping sandal, to another plane. 
Grahm, if you have just tuned in, is the winemaker and wordsmith who 
in 1993 founded Bonny Doon Vineyard in the hills just north of Santa 
Cruz. In the years since, he has garnered a reputation as one of the 
country's more imaginative winemakers, a tireless innovator in the 
cellar and vineyard, and one of the cleverest wine writers. With Le 
Cigare Volant, his now famous wine, he set the style for the Rhone 
Rangers, a group of young winemakers dedicated to the principle that 
the California wine country resembles the Rhone Valley more than it 
does Bordeaux and that its wines should reflect this. Le Cigare Volant, 
or flying cigar, pays homage to Chateauneuf-du-Pape, in the southern 
Rhone, where in 1954, the town council passed a law forbidding flying 
saucers, or cigars as they called them, from landing there. Since 
then, Grahm points out, none has. But put all this on hold: there 
is a new Randall Grahm. Or so it would seem. Gone, for the moment, 
at least, is the insouciance, the lightness of being, the outrageous 
puns, as in: ``This brandy to be taken eternally,'' ``One hundred 
years of Soledad,'' ``Lafite do your stuff'' and ``Absinthe makes 
the Art Garfunkel.'' Gone, too, are the long parodies in his newsletter 
of Baudelaire (``Les Fleurs du Malvasia'') and T.S. Eliot (``The Love 
Song of J. Alfred Rootstock''). ``The Bureaus of Florid Prose and 
Adjectiveorhea have both been indefinitely closed for renovation,'' 
is how Grahm put it. What now seems evident about him is not self-doubt, 
but a great deal of introspection and perhaps a slight sulfurous whiff, 
not of the vinous type but of burnout. An objective observer would 
have to say, ``with good reason.'' First, there was the loss of his 
vineyard. Most Bonny Doon fans _ and they are legion _are unaware 
that Pierce's disease, an insect-borne killer, wiped out the main 
vineyard in 1995. ``By the time we realized it was there, it was too 
late,'' Grahm said. There are other Bonny Doon vineyards near Soledad 
in Monterey County, southeast of Santa Cruz, where the vines are healthy, 
and there are grapes that can be bought from vineyards everywhere. 
There have to be such other routes when you are experimenting with 
30 varieties and selling some three dozen different wines. But the 
original barn-like winery is shuttered most of the time, except for 
Grahm's office upstairs, where he often works perched on a large rubber 
ball (``Good for the spine,'' he said). But the soul of the venture, 
the vineyard in the redwoods, is no more. Then there was the problem 
with a planned third winery. (His second winery, in downtown Santa 
Cruz, is in a seedy industrial park populated principally by matt-haired 
dudes making surfboards.) A year ago, Grahm announced that he would 
purchase an old winery and vineyard in the Livermore Valley, east 
of San Francisco. Then doubts set in. At one point, he hired a feng 
shui master, Dr. Wu, from Los Angeles to check out the suitability 
of the Livermore site. Dr. Wu said the site was ``very good for a 
graveyard.'' But his opinion wasn't the problem. ``I fear I may have 
been done in by my eternal archnemesis, that old committment thing,'' 
Grahm reflected. To bolster his own hypothesis, he noted that at 45, 
he is still not married even though he would like to be, or thinks 
he would like to be. With the old vineyard and the putative new winery 
both history, it was inevitable that Grahm turn his inner light to 
his _ and everyone else's _ wines. He has become an almost fanatical 
exponent of the European principle of terroir, the idea that a great 
wine is the product of soil, climate and weather, and that the winemaker's 
duty is to let nature take its course and not foul things up. ``In 
the Old World,'' he said, ``winegrowing is the process of uncovering 
the expressiveness of the vineyard and the varietal.'' In this country, 
he believes, the process has barely begun. ``The wine gestalt is an 
interplay between surface and depth,'' he said. ``We in this country 
can polish the surface, but it's a facade; we haven't got the depth. 
Fortunately, most people like the surface. The marketing people tell 
us the wines are selling well, but don't we in the small hours have 
the feeling that we are really putting one over on tout le monde?'' 
To find the depth he feels American wines lack, Grahm experiments 
with obscure grape varieties. He long ago abandoned the accepted standards 
_ cabernet sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay. ``We live in a chard- 
and cabocentric world,'' he once said. Instead, he has been a pioneer 
in working with the Rhone varieties like syrah, grenache, mourvedre, 
marsanne and roussanne. More recently, he has worked with Italian 
and Spanish varieties, the Portuguese grapes used in port, and less 
familiar French grapes like pinot meunier. Currently he is intrigued 
by tannat, the grape of Madiran, a wine of Southwest France. ``It 
makes a hard wine in France,'' he said, ``but a rich, soft wine in 
Uruguay.'' There is already a Bonny Doon Madiran, but it isn't easy 
to find. Grahm's own future is unclear. Bonny Doon goes on, possibly 
in a new Santa Cruz winery. He is thinking about a sabbatical of sorts, 
possibly at the feet of Nicolas Joly at Savennieres in the Loire Valley. 
Joly, who makes the s white wine known as Coulee de Serrant, is the 
leading proponent of biodynamics, a system of holistic agriculture 
developed by the Austrian philosopher Rudolph Steiner. Biodynamism 
takes organic farming to its extreme. Planting and pruning are timed 
to the position of the planets, harvest time is determined by the 
phases of the moon, and vines get homeopathic treatments rather than 
fertilizer and insecticides. More and more of France's and Italy's 
best winemakers use some or all of biodynamic methods. Fortunately 
for us, Grahm takes enough time out from wrestling with his muse to 
make good wine. Though his Le Cigare Volante is his best known, his 
zinfandel, which he named Cardinal Zin, is, in his words, ``pure sunshine.'' 
In his line of Italian-style wines, Ca' del Solo, one of them, ``Il 
Pescatore,'' is a delicious white. His Pacific Rim riesling actually 
includes about 20 percent of wine from Germany. As Grahm notes, ``The 
heart has its rieslings.'' Domaine des Blagueurs is a syrah from France. 
Then there are the eaux de vie in a variety of flavors, several vins 
glaciers, or California ice wines, and a couple of dynamite grappas. 
Suffice it to say that good things emanate from Bonny Doon and when 
Grahm is back in the groove, there'll be more: wines to match or surpass 
a 1994 pinot noir he called ``a bridge over truffled waters,'' a 1995 
sauvignon blanc virtually guaranteed to ``enhance your capacity to 
wonder'' and a nonvintage Clos de Gilroy (grenache) ``wonderful with 
grilled n'importe quoi.''
