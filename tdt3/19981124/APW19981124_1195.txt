Sylvain Wiltord showed his scoring qualities as he helped Girondins 
de Bordeaux to a 3-3 draw against hosts Grasshoppers of Zurich in 
a thrilling UEFA Cup third round match Tuesday. Wiltord took advantage 
of the Zurich team's sloppiness on the icy pitch to shoot Bordeaux 
into the lead in the sixth minute. Johan Micoud made it 2-0 in the 
20th minute. But then Grasshoppers woke up with a goal by Mikhail 
Kavelashvili just one minute later. Forward Kubilay Tuerkyilmaz, who 
has been plagued by injury and his own touchy temperament, scored 
for 2-2 in the 33rd minute. Tuerkyilmaz set up Grasshoppers' third 
goal in the 53rd minute, when Alexandre Comissetti scored an acrobatic 
goal after a goal mouth muddle and suspected hand ball. Capping a 
superb performance, Wiltord demonstrated why he is the top scorer 
in the French league with a stylish 3-3 equalizer in the 73rd minute. 
Grasshoppers advanced to the third round by default after Fiorentina 
was kicked out of this season's cup after an Italian spectator hurled 
an explosive device on to the pitch and injured a match official. 
The Zurich underdog considered itself unlucky not to emerge from Tuesday's 
match with a clear win. Tuerkyilmaz and substitute Patrick De Napoli 
both hit the bar on what should have been easy goals. It will now 
be an uphill struggle for Grasshoppers to overcome the Bordeaux home 
advantage in the second leg and advance past the team which is currently 
second in the French league standings. Only 7,200 fans braved the 
icy weather to watch the match.
