Pete Sampras began his bid to make tennis history Tuesday by beating 
Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-4 at the start of the ATP World Championship. 
Sampras, seeking to become the first man to finish as No. 1 in the 
world for six years in row, crushed the same opponent he beat in last 
year's final, when he won his fourth title in the elite season-ending 
tournament. He rolled through the first set with his powerful serve-and-volley 
game, making few errors and keeping Kafelnikov on the defensive. Sampras 
also broke the Russian's serve in the opening game of the second set. 
But Kafelnikov battled back when his passing shots found their range 
and he pulled level at 3-3. It proved to be a brief revival for Kafelnikov. 
Sampras won the next two games and had a match point at 5-3, but Kafelnikov 
hit a service winner to save himself. Sampras had trouble closing 
the match. He wasted four more match points, one on a double-fault 
and had to fight off a break point. But two straight backhand errors 
by Kafelnikov finally gave Sampras the victory after 66 minutes. Karol 
Kucera played Carlos Moya in a later match. Marcelo Rios, who trails 
Sampras by only 33 points in the rankings and has a shot at taking 
over the No. 1 spot in final year rankings, played the last match 
of the day, against Tim Henman. Kafelnikov was the last player to 
clinch a place in the dlrs 3.5 million tournament that brings together 
the eight players with the best results in the year. The round-robin 
portion consists of two four-man groups, with two players from each 
advancing to the semifinals. Sampras now has a 10-2 career lead over 
Kafelnikov and has won heir last six matches. He beat Kafelnikov in 
three quick sets in last year's final. To remain ahead of Rios, Sampras 
basically has to keep pace with the Chilean. Rios needs to win at 
least two round-robin matches to have a shot at No. 1. Two players 
from each group advance to the semifinals. Sampras has finished the 
last five years as No. 1 in the world, a record he shares with Connors, 
the fellow American who did it from 1974 to 1978.
