And another important piece of consumer news tonight. Millions of 
playpens are being recalled because they are said to pose a risk of 
strangulation for children wearing loose clothing or pacifier strings. 
They are mesh models that could be folded sold under these brand names. 
Some were made as long as 38 years ago and some as recently as last 
spring. The consumer products safety commission says eight children 
died since 1982 when strings around their necks or clothing got caught 
on metal rivets on the playpens.
