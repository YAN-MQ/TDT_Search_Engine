In a move to broaden support for peace within his crumbling hard-line 
coalition, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried to woo 
a moderate defector back into his Cabinet Tuesday. Stacked with staunch 
right-wingers who oppose ceding war-captured land to the Palestinians, 
the Cabinet narrowly approved the latest Mideast land-for-peace peace 
accord and a minority of the ministers voted for the deal in parliament. 
It was only with the help of dovish opposition parties that the peace 
agreement was approved and Netanyahu's government remained in tact. 
But facing no-confidence motions on tricky budgetary legislation in 
December, the return of former foreign minister David Levy _ and the 
five parliament seats he controls _ to Netanyahu's pack would bolster 
his majority and help ensure a smooth ride through the Knesset and 
into the new year. Asked if Levy was about to rejoin the government, 
Netanyahu said Tuesday, ``that possibility exists. I hope that it 
will also be practical. That is why the contacts are taking place.'' 
Levy, a moderate who leads the small Gesher party, resigned from government 
in January over the premier's peace policies. At the time, negotiations 
between Israel and the Palestinians had been frozen for nearly a year. 
Levy described the government as being ``on a flight to nowhere.'' 
Tuesday, Levy suggested that with the signing of the Mideast accord 
last month, the government looked more appealing. ``Now that the government 
is taking the political course that I demanded ... we in Gesher will 
convene and decide,'' he told Channel Two TV. Negotiations for Levy's 
return were expected to continue into the night Tuesday and Israel 
radio said Netanyahu may delay his departure to Switerland for an 
official visit Wednesday by several hours. Gesher was expected to 
vote Wednesday morning to rejoin the coalition. Netanyahu has reportedly 
offered Levy the Ministry for National Infrastructure, vacated after 
Ariel Sharon filled Levy's spot at the foreign ministry.
