Tomorrow at this time, we meet the first woman ever elected to the 
job as principal chief of the Eastern band of the Cherokee nation. 
Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Today is Tuesday, November 
24th, 1998. Thirty-five years ago today -- that's in 1963 -- Lee Harvey 
Oswald, the accused assassin of President John F. Kennedy was murdered. 
Dallas, Texas, police were escorting Oswald through the basement of 
police headquarters to take him to a more secure jail. It was there 
that Jack Ruby, a local nightclub manager, stepped from a crowd of 
reporters and photographers and shot the suspected assassin. Millions 
of America's -- Americans witnessed Ruby's murder of Oswald during 
a live television broadcast. That broadcast would be replayed countless 
times over the years. Oswald died two hours after being rushed to 
the same emergency room hospital where President Kennedy had died 
two days earlier. On November 24th, 1832, the South Carolina legislature 
enacted a measure to nullify a federal tariff on cotton, once the 
state's main crop. The state said it had the authority to ignore federal 
acts that it found repugnant. South Carolina's once-hugely productive 
cotton fields had lost their fertility and cotton crops were no longer 
so profitable. Members of the legislature said the federal tariff 
would drive many cotton farmers out of business; thus, the decision 
to ignore the law. On December 10th, 1832, President Andrew Jackson 
said, if the South Carolinians ignored the federal law, he would send 
federal troops to collect the tax, to arrest the leaders of the nullification 
faction and, if necessary, to hang them for treason. Well, that's 
it on this hour of VOA News Now. Please stay tuned as our program 
continues with the summary of news. It's Universal Time, and this 
is VOA News Now. A new airport opens in the Gaza strip giving Palestinians 
new hopes for economic development. News agency reports out of Congo 
Kinshasa say government forces killed up to 600 rebels in a weekend 
air strike on boats on Lake Tanganyika. And on today's Dateline segment, 
we'll look into U.S. support for opposition groups. Now a summary 
of world news.
