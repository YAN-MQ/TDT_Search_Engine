Russia on Tuesday agreed to complete work on an Iranian nuclear plant 
and study the possibility of building a second one, Iranian radio 
reported. Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov signed an 
agreement with Mohammed Aghazadeh, head of the Iran's Atomic Energy 
Organization, to complete the Bushehr power plant, the radio said. 
The United States and Israel have objected to the 1,000-megawatt Bushehr 
plant, saying it could be used to develop nuclear weapons. But Russia 
says the reactor can be used only for civilian purposes. Under Tuesday's 
agreement, a Russian-Iranian committee will study the feasibility 
of constructing another nuclear power plant over the next three months, 
the radio said. It did not give other details. Adamov arrived in Iran 
Saturday to check on the building of the nuclear plant in the southern 
port of Bushehr. Adamov said that Russia was cooperating with Iran 
in the area of safe disposal of nuclear waste, the official Islamic 
Republic News Agency reported. Russia is to install a VOWER-1000 light 
water reactor in the plant. The contract is worth dlrs 800,000 the 
Russian news agency Interfax said. Iran says the Bushehr plant will 
be used only to generate power. It notes that its facilities have 
been approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
