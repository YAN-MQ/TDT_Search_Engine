International Paper Co., the nation's largest paper maker, announced 
Tuesday that it would buy a rival, Union Camp Corp., for $5 billion 
in stock in one of the first consolidations in an industry that has 
consistently lost money because it produces too much. The merger would 
greatly expand International Paper's leading market position in the 
office paper market and would make it the No. 2 supplier of containerboard, 
the thick brown paper used to make boxes. The merger will also be 
followed by a $300 million cost-cutting program, including the closing 
of some administrative offices and reductions in overhead. The possibility 
of job losses is unclear. Analysts said International Paper's move 
was long overdue in an industry that has lost money for nearly a decade, 
fallen behind in a rising stock market, been battered by the Asian 
crisis and stubbornly avoided a corporate downsizing that has swept 
the nation's manufacturers. ``This merger tells us what a lot of us 
have been crying and screaming and shouting for over the last years,'' 
said Linda Lieberman, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``This 
is an industry in desperate need of consolidation. This is a blueprint 
for something that has to take place and is an important first step.'' 
Paper industry stocks, as moribund as the industry, came alive on 
this move and hopes of further mergers. Shares of Champion International 
Corp., a pulp-and-paper company, rose $3.875, to $43.1875; stock of 
Georgia-Pacific Corp. rose $5.6875, to $59.625, and shares of Boise 
Cascade Corp. rose $4.3125, to $32.1875. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
index of paper manufacturing stocks rose 5.8 percent. The big market 
winner was Union Camp, which rose $16 to close at $64.9375. Just last 
month the company reported falling earnings for the first nine months 
of 1998 and announced a restructuring designed to save $42 million 
a year. International Paper, which has generally traded in a range 
around $45 for the last few months, closed at $44, down $1.8125. Adding 
to the market bounce was the announcement Tuesday that the newly merged 
Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., the biggest maker of cardboard boxes, 
would cut as many as 3,600 jobs, or 10 percent of its workforce. This 
move, which will result in a $350 million fourth-quarter charge against 
earnings, is designed to reduce an oversupply of containerboard. The 
problem in the paper industry is simple: There are too many companies 
and too much paper supply to match a demand for paper products that 
has been growing only slowly. Prices have fallen; for instance, prices 
for linerboard, a form of containerboard, dropped to $350 a ton last 
month from $530 a ton in 1995. The Asian crisis has worsened the oversupply 
by reducing the export market for domestic paper products. ``This 
is an industry that has completely collapsed from an investor point 
of view,'' said Kathryn McAuley, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman. 
``Something had to be done. There are too many players and too much 
supply. The industry has had, maybe, two profitable years in the past 
10 years. They've had ugly, difficult years, and Asia was the last 
straw.'' John Dillon, chief executive of International Paper, which 
is based in Purchase, N.Y., called the merger ``a perfect fit.'' Union 
Camp chief executive W. Craig McClelland said the savings that result 
from the merger would ``create significant value for shareholders.'' 
As part of the deal, International Paper will also assume $1.6 billion 
in Union Camp's debt. For years, the nation's paper industry has suffered 
from cyclical price fluctuations. A major reason is widespread industry 
fragmentation, which was only made worse in the early 1990s, when 
one company after another added unneeded plants and production capacity. 
But in a corporate version of the Cold War, no company wanted to shut 
its operations to reduce output; instead, all continued to produce 
paper, driving prices down. ``You can't change an industry that has 
traditionally been based on building capacity,'' Ms. Lieberman said. 
``But this move is designed to take a cyclical business and make it 
a little less cyclical. You can get cost reductions, transportation 
benefits and reduce your headquarters staff.'' In acquiring Union 
Camp, based in Wayne, N.J., International Paper is taking over a company 
with assets described as the Rolls-Royce of the paper industry. Union 
Camp has around 18,000 employees in 40 countries; International Paper 
has more than 80,000 employees in 30 countries and exports to 130 
countries. ``Union Camp is really an excellent choice,'' said Ms. 
McAuley of Brown Brothers. ``Their product lines match up perfectly. 
This was a strategically brilliant move by International Paper.''
