I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News. After more than two years of delays, 
the Palestinian International Airport in Gaza has been officially 
opened. As VOA's David Gullus reports from Gaza, the airport is an 
important symbol of sovereignty for the Palestinians who aspire to 
full statehood. Several thousand people crowded the tarmac to greet 
arriving aircraft from Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Western Europe, 
but the biggest cheers were for a turbo prop from the Palestinian 
airline whose pilot waved a Palestinian flag from the window as he 
pulled up to the terminal. Palestinian Finance Minister Nashashibi 
said it was a moment of both symbolic and practical importance. It 
is a symbol of sovereignty to facilitate our foreign trade with the 
world. Besides, here the Palestinian -- the traveler, the citizen 
-- will feel the full dignity of traveling from his own airport, not 
as it happens somewhere else. The opening was long delayed by negotiations 
over Israel's security role at the airport which will be considerable.
