Colin Hendry saved his own net and then fed teammate Rod Wallace for 
the equalizer in a hard-fought 1-1 draw between Rangers and Parma 
in a third-round first-leg game of the UEFA Cup match Tuesday night. 
The Scottish team, which fell behind on a 51st minute goal by Argentine 
veteran striker Abel Balbo, fought back, tied the score in the 68th 
and missed the game winner with Gordon Durie in injury time. The draw, 
in the sold-out Ilbrox park, left unchanged qualifying chances of 
both teams for the Dec. 8 second-leg at Parma. Balbo put the Italian 
team in front kicking in from a few meters a ball lost by Finnish 
keeper Antti Niemi on a powerful drive by the other Argentine forward 
of Parma, Hernan Crespo. It was an all-Argentine combination, started 
by midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron. Crespo had the opportunity to 
make it 2-0 seven minutes later but Hendry managed to clear the ball 
from the netline as the young Argentine prepared to kick into the 
empty net. In the action, Hendry bruised his chest hitting the post. 
However he did not show any pain ten minutes later as he jumped higher 
than two Parma defenders and headed a perfect pass for Wallace who 
kicked in from a few meters. As Parma faded out, Rangers attacked 
furiously in the last 20 minutes. Durie, a second half substitute, 
headed past the bar from a few meters a perfect cross from Argentine 
teammate Gabriel Amato in the 91st. And it was up to keeper Niemi 
to save Rangers net with a spectacular dive, in the 92nd, on a short-range 
shot by midfielder Stefano Fiore. Hendry and Jorg Albertz were the 
best men on the Scottish side while French world champion Lilian Thuram 
made decisive defensive moves for Parma.
