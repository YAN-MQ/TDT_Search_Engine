A little pig can go a long way. It can even make a return visit to 
movie theaters. Paul Vercammen has more on "babe: pig in the city." 
I want my mom. "babe" the pig was 1995's wonder from down under. The 
film shot in Australia basked in the academy award spotlight, receiving 
seven Oscar nominations, including best picture. In the supporting 
actor category, for "babe," James Cromwell. And best supporting actor 
for James Cromwell as farmer hoggett. "Babe" made more than $240 million 
worldwide at the box office. Now the celebrated swine returns with 
"babe: pig in the city." That'll do, pig. This is a much more dramatic, 
in-your-face confrontational kind of story. I categorize it as "babe" 
meets "road warrior." Can babe and his barnyard friends keep their 
innocence? This second "babe" movie takes on some serious tones on 
several levels. Babe is lost in the city, has to find his own way, 
make his own contacts, survive in the city, which is a hostile environment. 
Talk about challenges. It took a rather long nine months to shoot 
"babe: pig in the city." The film was hit by production delays. And 
director George Miller toned down some scenes he thought might be 
too disturbing for very young moviegoers. George, bless his heart, 
is in the driver seat. And he's able to say right up until this Mammoth 
fund-raising benefit, "It's not ready. It's not the film that I want 
people to see. I ain't going to do it." And I think it takes a lot 
of courage, especially in this town. Plus, there's added pressure 
as universal studios desperately needs a hit. Cromwell predicts "babe," 
just like the first time, will again touch the hearts of several generations. 
This is what the world looks like to a kid. They have to be taught 
that it looks like the mess we've created. But when they actually 
look out there, it's a miracle. Every day is just stunning. Adults, 
you see, have forgotten all this and how little effort, really, it 
takes to have it work out the way you want it to work out. So this 
actor, and the rest of "babe's" friends are rooting for another trek 
to hog heaven. Paul Vercammen, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
