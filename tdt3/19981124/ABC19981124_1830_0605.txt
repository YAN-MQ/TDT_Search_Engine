Grief in rush yarks pride in the Middle East. Today it is hard to 
overstate the sense of pride that Palestinians feel. The Israelis 
have at last relented, and the Palestinians have finally opened their 
own airport in Gaza, their own international airport. ABC's Gillian 
Findlay reports from Gaza on an important symbol of freedom. Many 
of them had never seen an airplane up close. Today they celebrated 
as the planes came into land, one after the other. For Palestinians, 
this airport is a symbol of their independence and their nation. It 
means a state. An airport means a state. Until now, a Palestinian 
living in Gaza who wanted to travel to jordan, for instance, just 
110 miles away, faced a daunting trip. First a permit from the Israelis. 
Not everyone qualifies. Then the checkpoints, one to get out of Gaza, 
another to cross the border into Jordan. That trip could take an entire 
day. Soon Palestinians will be able to fly without Israeli permission 
in just over an hour. Before this airport, we were under Israeli occupation. 
Now we can go directly to the world without any Israeli intervention. 
While the Gaza international airport may be a symbol of palestinian 
sovereignty, there are some powers Israel has insisted on. Israel 
will decide which airlines can take off and land. They will also monitor 
Palestinian security checks. Perhaps the most emotional part of today's 
celebration was the arrival of the first of three planes belonging 
to the fledgling Palestinian airlines. For months, the planes have 
been in Egypt waiting for their home airport to become a reality. 
Today it did. And so did the dreams of many Palestinian people. Gillian 
Findlay, ABC News, Gaza.
