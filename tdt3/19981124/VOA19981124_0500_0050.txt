I'm Bill Hazard with VOA News. With great fanfare, Palestinian authorities 
have inaugurated their first international air port, which officials 
say, will be a boon to the economy. VOA correspondent, David Gulles 
reports from the ceremonial opening. An Egyptian jetliner, carrying 
a delegation of senior officials from Cairo, was the first to land 
here. It was followed by a succession of flights from Arab countries 
and Western Europe. Commercial service at the airport will not actually 
begin for another few weeks. But, the ceremonial opening triggered 
celebrations by Palestinians, who see it as another step toward the 
statehood they aspire to as early as next year. Several hundred Palestinians, 
government officials, but also ordinary citizens from the nearby town 
of Conunis milled about the tarmac where the aircraft were parked. 
Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, personally welcomed the arriving 
delegations. He called the airport opening an important step in implementing 
last month's U.S. Brokard Y River Agreement which also produced the 
first Israeli hand-over of land to the Palestinians in the West Bank 
in nearly two years. David Gulles, VOA News at the Palestinian Airport 
in Gaza.
