Two convicted killers on Tuesday asked Jamaica's highest court to 
block their imminent hangings, claiming their cases are still being 
heard by international tribunals. Dalton Daley and Peter Blaine are 
scheduled for the gallows on Thursday. Blaine was convicted of killing 
a golf consultant in 1992; Daley was convicted of killing three people 
the same year. They claim their appeals to the Interamerican Human 
Rights Commission, a tribunal organized by the Organization of American 
States, have not been decided yet. Jamaica and Trinidad have said 
they plan to withdraw from the human rights agreement that gives prisoners 
the right to appeal to the commission. Jamaica has meantime placed 
a six-month limit on death row appeals to international bodies. Former 
British colonies in the Caribbean are increasingly resisting pressure 
from Britain to eliminate the death penalty. Jamaica, Trinidad and 
Tobago and Guyana have led efforts to form their own supreme court 
and sever ties to the British Privy Council, the final authority in 
criminal cases for most of the English-speaking Caribbean. In 1993, 
the Privy Council ruled it is inhumane to keep prisoners on death 
row for more than five years, effectively overturning the death sentences 
of dozens of convicts. Caribbean countries say they need to preserve 
the death penalty because it deters crime linked to drug trafficking 
through the region. The two men, together with Milton Montaque _ who 
is scheduled to be hanged Dec. 1, _ have been held in the death row 
cell at St. Catherine Adult Correctional Center for the last 10 days 
awaiting execution. The Bahamas hanged two men on Oct. 15, its first 
executions in 12 years. St. Kitts and Nevis executed its first prisoner 
since 1985 on July 20.
