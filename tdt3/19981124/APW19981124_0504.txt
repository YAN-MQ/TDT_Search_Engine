A months-long upheaval in the Cyprus Orthodox church over fraud allegations 
against a bishop was settled quietly Tuesday with the cleric's resignation 
and temporary suspension from ecclesiastical duties. However, an independent 
inquiry by the Cypriot attorney-general into fraud allegations involving 
Bishop Chrysanthos of Limassol is continuing. An official announcement 
by the Holy Synod of the Cyprus Orthodox Church said the synod accepted 
Chrysanthos' resignation submitted the previous day and imposed a 
two-year suspension on him from involvement ``in every holy duty.'' 
This means that the bishop retains his rank and will continue to live 
in the official residence but will not conduct church services, explained 
synod secretary Archimandrite Vassilios Papafotis. The synod reached 
its verdict after considering a report by a special committee of bishops 
which found Chrysanthos was involved in fraud and profiteering through 
currency speculation and had taken advantage of his office for illicit 
profit. Bishop Chrysanthos has rejected charges he made personal profits 
from his actions. But he apologized to the synod for becoming naively 
involved in alleged quick-profit schemes to raise funds for charity.
