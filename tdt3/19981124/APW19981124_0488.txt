Following the European Union vote to lift a ban on British beef imposed 
because of fears of ``mad-cow'' disease, non-member Switzerland demanded 
Tuesday that it should get similar treatment. Some 35 countries worldwide 
_ including neighboring Germany, France, Italy and Austria _ have 
barred exports of Swiss cattle and beef because of health fears, although 
there is not a formal EU ban. Since November 1990, there have been 
about 280 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, making 
Switzerland the second-hardest hit nation after Britain. Otherwise 
known as ``mad-cow'' disease, BSE has been linked to a fatal brain 
ailment in humans. Although not a big beef exporter, Swiss farmers 
have suffered from the restrictions on exports of live animals. The 
Swiss Federal Veterinary Office said the same scientific and health 
criteria considered in Monday's EU vote to lift the British ban, should 
be applied to Switzerland. But it added that Switzerland would maintain 
its own ban on British exports. The veterinary office said some 10,000 
cows would be tested using a pioneering technique that can detect 
a BSE infection six months before symptoms of the illness break out. 
The European Commission, Portugal and several German states have expressed 
interest in the test.
