This is one Turkey that won't end up on anybody's Thanksgiving dinner 
table. President Clinton pardoned the 45-pound bird at the White House 
this afternoon. It will spend the rest of its days at a petting zoo 
outside Washington. If this bird hadn't cooperated, however, there 
was a spare Turkey standing by just in case. The vice Turkey, I guess.
