U.S. College football coach, Hayden Fry is leaving the University 
of Iowa, after 20 seasons, and transforming a struggling program into 
a big-ten power. The 69-year old Fry leaves as the winningest coach 
in Iowa history, with 143 victories, 89 loses and 6 ties. Iowa reached 
the number-one ranking, for six weeks under Fry, back in 1985. He 
led the Hawkeyes to 14 post-season bowl appearances including three 
trips to the Rose Bowl. Fry ends his 10-year after his worst season 
at Iowa, winning three games and losing eight.
