Sidelined yet again by illness, President Boris Yeltsin is resting 
in a hospital where he is likely to stay for at least a week while 
he recovers from pneumonia, aides said Tuesday. Presidential spokesman 
Dmitry Yakushkin said the president's condition was stable and his 
temperature was normal. Yeltsin played host to Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin in a hospital reception room Monday. Aides said the president 
would likely cancel other meetings with foreign visitors this month 
but will meet Russian officials at the hospital. Yeltsin, 67, was 
suddenly hospitalized with what the Kremlin called pneumonia and a 
high temperature Sunday, his third ailment in recent weeks, reviving 
worries about his ability to run a vast country deep in economic crisis. 
Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term, which 
ends in the year 2000. Under the Russian constitution, the prime minister 
takes over for three months if the president dies or is incapacitated. 
Yeltsin's condition ``hasn't worsened, but it hasn't improved either,'' 
and he still has a slight temperature, presidential spokesman Dmitry 
Yakushkin said on Russia's NTV television Monday night. In television 
footage of his meeting with Jiang, Yeltsin was chuckling and wearing 
a sweater and did not look very ill. The Russian president has rarely 
been seen in public recently, and the Kremlin has only allowed limited 
television coverage of him, fueling speculation that he is seriously 
sick. He fell ill twice in October. Doctors described the first as 
a respiratory ailment and the second as high blood pressure and exhaustion. 
Since then, the Kremlin appears to have been taking little chance 
with the president's health, ensuring that he has frequent medical 
checks and keeping his schedule to a minimum. ``His doctors were not 
delighted that he decided to meet Jiang,'' Yakushkin said. He wouldn't 
say how long Yeltsin would stay in the hospital. He said treatment 
for pneumonia usually takes 8-10 days. Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko, 
in an interview on NTV, added: ``Knowing the president's character, 
he will have his own point of view on how long he has to stay in the 
hospital.'' Opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist politicians 
have questioned whether Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and speculation 
has grown about early elections.
