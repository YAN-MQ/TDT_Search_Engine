With the holiday shopping season about to kick into gear, a warning 
that some toys can be dangerous. The U.S. public interest research 
group lists 24 dangerous toys this year, urging parents to avoid ones 
with small parts for kids under 3. and toys with balloons should be 
kept away from kids as old as 7. the research group says toys are 
not always as safe as they seem. Children can't help themselves, and 
parents presume that toys that are on the shelves have been tested, 
that have been approved by the government. They haven't. Neither of 
those things is true. The toy manufacturers are supposed to make toys 
that meet the government tests. They don't always do so, and we don't 
know until we find out about a Tragedy.
