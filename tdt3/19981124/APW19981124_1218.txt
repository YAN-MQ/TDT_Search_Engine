A leading Jewish fraternal organization has nominated Jordan's King 
Hussein for the Nobel Peace Prize for his assistance during the Wye 
Plantation talks that led to an Israeli-Palestinian accord. Hussein's 
``personal participation ... was instrumental in the success'' of 
the October talks at Wye River, B'nai B'rith International president 
Richard Heideman said in a letter to the Nobel Committee, a statement 
by the group said. The statement, issued by the group's office in 
Washington D.C., was received by The Associated Press in Cairo. The 
Wye talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat led to the accord on Israeli troops withdrawal 
from more West Bank land in exchange for Palestinian efforts to crack 
down on terrorists. ``The king's involvement, by itself, would merit 
this nomination,'' Heideman said in the letter. Hussein left the Mayo 
Clinic, where he is undergoing cancer treatment, to push forward the 
talks at a moment when they appeared on the verge of collapsing. ``As 
perhaps the one person with sufficient trust and respect of the parties 
to guide them to an agreement they might not otherwise have reached, 
he was indispensable,'' Heideman said. Hussein signed a peace treaty 
with Israel in 1994, making Jordan the second Arab country after Egypt 
to make peace with Israel. The 1978 Camp David Accords that led to 
the Israel-Egypt peace treaty earned the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize for 
the then leaders of the two countries, Prime Minister Menachem Begin 
and Anwar Sadat. Late former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel 
shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize with his foreign minister, Shimon 
Peres, and Arafat for reaching the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian accords 
in Oslo.
