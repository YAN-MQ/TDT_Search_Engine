The European Union Tuesday warned Turkey it could face retaliatory 
sanctions from the whole 15-nation EU if it boycotts Italian imports 
over Rome's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
``A boycott by Turkey or Turkish public companies would be a clear 
violation of our accords,'' said European Commission President Jacques 
Santer. At a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, 
Santer said the EU would seek urgent consultations with Turkey, if 
it introduces sanctions on Italy. ``If those consultations don't work, 
the Union could legitimately impose retaliation,'' Santer said. Turkish 
ministers have said the country will ban Italian firms from seeking 
defense contracts and Italian television networks will be excluded 
from Turkish cables. Hundreds of companies have also announced boycotts 
of Italian goods amid widespread outrage in Turkey over Italy's refusal 
to hand over Ocalan. Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or 
PKK, which has fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's 
southeast. The conflict has killed some 37,000 people. Turkey says 
Ocalan is a terrorist and should be brought to trial. Italy's constitution 
forbids it from extraditing suspects to countries where they may face 
the death penalty. The 15 EU nations issued a statement over the weekend 
backing Italy's stance. ``It is important we express our solidarity 
with Italy as it applies rights enshrined in its constitution,'' Santer 
said. The conflict seems certain to further harm Turkey's relations 
with the EU, which have been strained since last December when the 
EU leaders pushed Turkey to the back of a line of 12 nations seeking 
to join the Union. Both Santer and D'Alema said they hoped the dispute 
could be resolved through negotiation without it coming to a trade 
war. ``We don't want to damage the Turkish economy, quite the reverse,'' 
the Italian leader said. ``On the other hand we don't want our interests 
damaged.''
