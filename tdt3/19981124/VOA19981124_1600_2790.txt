And smoking is on the increase among college students in the United 
States. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found that 
the proportion of college students who smoke has increased by 28 percent 
in the past five years. Harvard's Dr. Henry Wexler laments the increase. 
This we feel is a very dangerous sign for American youth, and it points 
to perhaps a long-term rise in smoking rates. We suggest more smoking 
cessation programs among colleges and increasing non-smoking areas, 
particularly in the residential quarters of college students. The 
Harvard survey found that one-quarter of the smokers did not smoke 
on a regular basis until they got to college and that half the smokers 
had tried to quit within the previous year.
