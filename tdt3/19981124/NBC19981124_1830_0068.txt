Good evening. Two of the most powerful forces on the Internet are 
merging a marriage of technology, marketing, service and commerce 
that is expected to be an instant dynasty. American online and Netscape 
hope to control a huge chunk of the fast-growing Internet business 
getting you to a world of buying opportunities and information swiftly 
and easily. We begin with NBC's Mike Jensen on the prospects and consequences. 
It's a merger of giants. America online, with 14 million subscribers, 
30 million visitors every month -- the biggest of the companies that 
connect people to the Internet. Netscape -- 9 million customers, one 
of the biggest companies that steer people to specific web sites once 
they get on the Internet. The announcement made, of course, on the 
Internet. We think the time is right to take this step. The step creates 
a company big enough to compete head-to-head with Microsoft in a high 
stakes game. Millions of web sites that sell almost every product 
made. $7 billion worth of merchandise this year alone. All so much 
a part of the mainstream that a new Hollywood movie called "You've 
got mail" isn't about the post office. It's about the Internet. With 
the Internet part entertainment, part commerce, it's not surprising 
that AOL, which is capitalizing on both, is run by the creator of 
MTV and by the man who used to run pizza hut. Trying to make AOL the 
one place people will go when they turn on their computer. They might 
want to watch television to be entertained. They might drive to the 
mall to buy a product. You can do all that in better ways on the Internet. 
The new merged company, with revenues of more than $3 billion will 
have enormous clout. AOL is becoming the General Motors of the Internet. 
Consumer groups say that's bad. Too much power in the hands of one 
company. But at the Internet cafe in New York, no one seemed worried. 
I think it will allow Netscape to compete more effectively with Microsoft. 
Analysts say there'll be more big Internet mergers, that there are 
dozens of major companies now, but in five years, there may be only 
three or four powerhouses dominating the industry. Mike Jensen, NBC 
news, New York.
