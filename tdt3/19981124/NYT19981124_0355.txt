The Republicans' post-election power struggle spilled into the Senate 
on Tuesday as Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska said he would seek the 
leadership post overseeing campaign fund-raising and election strategy. 
In a challenge to Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Hagel came out 
against ``constant, demonizing, negative campaigning'' and said Republicans 
should help clean up the nation's political culture. ``I think one 
of the things Republicans learned in 1998 is you can't just win by 
beating up on your opponent and giving America no positive alternative,'' 
he said. The Republicans' election showing _ in which they held their 
own in the Senate but lost five seats in the House _ led to the resignation 
of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the toppling of two of his lieutenants. 
In the Senate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, is 
unopposed in leadership elections next week, as are Sen. Don Nickles 
of Oklahoma, the majority whip; and Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, the 
Republican policy chairman. But McConnell, the chairman of the National 
Republican Senatorial Committee chairman and the Senate's most ardent 
opponent of overhauling the campaign finance law, was criticized by 
some Senate Republicans who said he put too much energy and money 
into his quest to defeat Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., a leading 
sponsor of campaign finance legislation, and to elect Rep. Jim Bunning 
to the Senate from his home state of Kentucky. Feingold won but so 
did Bunning. McConnell's post will be particularly important in 2000 
because Republicans will have 19 Senate seats to defend while only 
14 Democrats will be up for re-election. McConnell is also in line 
this year to become chairman of the Rules Committee and the two posts 
combined will give him enormous power. ``We feel confident of our 
vote count,'' said Mike Russell, a spokesman for McConnell, ``and 
we are sensing a lot of unease about the idea of turning the committee 
over to a two-year freshman in a cycle when our majority is on the 
line.'' Hagel said, ``If I didn't believe I could win I wouldn't be 
here.'' Lott all but endorsed McConnell on Tuesday, saying, ``It is 
critical that we elect a chairman of the senatorial committee with 
the seasoned experience and skill to lead us to victory.'' Hagel said 
he would emphasize raising money for individual Senate candidates 
and concentrate less on ``soft money,'' which political parties have 
used increasingly to get around federal limits on donations to individuals. 
He also said that the sides in the battle over the campaign finance 
law should ``find a common denominator.'' But like McConnell, he said 
he opposed a soft money ban. In the House the incoming speaker, Robert 
Livingston, met with Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, 
Tuesday to discuss issues including the Democrats' demand for 43 more 
committee seats because the next Congress will be nearly evenly divided 
between the two parties. The Republicans have 91 more seats than Democrats 
hold. There was little sign the two leaders were off to a less partisan 
start. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Livingston, said Republicans 
``made some good faith offers'' that Democrats have not accepted. 
Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Gephardt, said the Republicans had 
offered seven more seats, which she called ``anything but good faith.''
