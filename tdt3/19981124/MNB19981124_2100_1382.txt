Palestinians celebrated the opening of an important national symbol 
today. An Egypt air jet was the first plane to land at the new Gaza 
international airport. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat presided over 
today's opening, delayed for two years over Israeli security concerns. 
Also arriving was a plane belonging to the brand-new Palestine airlines 
which will provide service to Egypt and Jordan beginning next week.
