Albanians have apparently said yes to the country's first post-communist 
constitution that would guarantee religious freedom of the rights 
of ethnic minorities. Official results from Sunday's referendum are 
still pending, but officials say, more than 50 percent of the electorate 
cast ballots, and the majority voted in favor of the measure. The 
outcome, however, is being questioned by opposition leader and former 
president Soli Baresha, who charges the results have been rigged. 
But, observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe say voting was conducted properly.
