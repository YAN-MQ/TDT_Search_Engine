A federal judge in Miami has thrown out a Florida law that prohibits 
a Certain type of late-term abortion. He says the law is vague and 
places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion. 
The law, which contains no provisions to protect a pregnant woman's 
health, was to go into effect last June but was blocked by a temporary 
restraining order.
