More and more people are reporting telephone and Internet scams. Those 
complaints are the fastest risers in an annual survey of consumer 
groups and government watchdog agencies. Complaints about telephone 
service and marketing account for the biggest jump, and there's been 
a 23% increase in Internet-related gripes since last year's survey.

however the state and local protection agencies are grossly underfunded, 
the research suggests that in the course of a year 40% to 50% of households 
experience a serious problem and that would be -- and some of them

a Complaint agency. Consumer complaints about home improvements and 
automobile sales still top the annual list.
