You're listening to The World. Remember, you can join us anytime online 
at www.theworld.org. This is The World on PRI. That's Public Radio 
International. I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come on The World, Iraq 
looks to the Arab world for help out of the current crisis. And Japanese 
students look to a painful past. We Japanese young generation really 
don't know anything about what we did to China. Also, we mull over 
the musical merits and maneuvers of Mangu. First, though, this news.
