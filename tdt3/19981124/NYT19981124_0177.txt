On the eve of the release of the 1998 Beaujolais Nouveau, some Americans 
were in the Caves Esteve, one of this city's better wine shops, pleading 
with the owner, Jean-Christophe Esteve, for a taste of the new wine. 
The Beaujolais Nouveau is always released on the third Thursday of 
November. ``Come back at midnight,'' he told them, smiling. ``Maybe 
I can do something for you then.'' To sell the wine before its official 
release date can cost the seller almost $250 a bottle in fines. Parties 
welcoming the wine began at midnight, but most Parisians had their 
first nouveau sighting last Thursday morning on their way to work: 
every cafe and supermarket had the sign, ``The Nouveau has arrived.'' 
Prices were about $3 to $6. The wine, as always, is fresh, fruity 
and easy to drink. The 1998 season was not a great one in Beaujolais; 
there was plenty of rain, which means lots of chaptalization, or adding 
sugar to the fermentation to boost alcohol content. Even so, the color 
is good _ purplish-red _ and the bouquet is more that of juice than 
of wine, with the touch of banana that the winemakers insist isn't 
there. George Duboeuf's version is perennially good and easy to find. 
Among others that should be available in the United States, I enjoyed 
one by Louis Tete and another by Jaffelin. If you don't buy your Thanksgiving 
wine until the last minute, you might try new ``Bojo.'' Or a good 
1997 Beaujolais, like Duboeuf's Julienas, at about the same price.
