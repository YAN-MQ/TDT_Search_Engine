Good evening. We begin tonight with vice President Al Gore. Vice presidents 
don't often lead the news. But Mr. Gore can breathe a little more 
easily tonight. That's a political assessment, not a medical one. 
The attorney general Janet Reno has decided not to ask for an independent 
counsel to investigate whether Mr. Gore engaged in illegal fund-raising 
activities in the 1996 election here is ABC's John Cochran. It was 
a day of high-stakes suspense. And for hours, as she went about other 
business, Janet Reno gave no hints. She knew ruling against an independent 
counsel would leave her open to charges that she had a conflict of 
interest, that she was Currie ying favor at the White House. As he 
waited, the vice president knew a decision for an independent counsel 
could devastate his presidential hopes and encourage other democrats 
to challenge him for the nomination. Not appointment of an independent 
counsel means Mr. Gore doesn't have to go into the campaign with a 
cloud over his head of an investigation, a cloud that can always start 
raining. At issue, did the vice president lie when he told federal 
investigators about his fund-raising role in the 1996 campaign? Gore 
made calls from his White House office to raise money, but said he 
thought it was legal because it was so-called "soft money," money 
to help the democratic party, not hard money money to directly benefit 
the clinton-Gore campaign, which would be illegal. But this summer, 
a memo turned up suggesting that the vice president knew the party 
would divide the money 65% soft, 35% hard. So, had Gore lied? Today, 
the attorney general in a written statement said -- no, that the handwritten 
note as lone are not sufficient to warrant a conclusion that the vice 
president made a false statement. Just as she knew would happen, some 
republicans were quick to blast her. They keep cutting this into such 
slifers that literally you can't get to the real big issues that are 
the issues of corruption. I'm becoming more and more convinced we 
have to take this hand out of the hands of the attorney general. The 
attorney general still has to decide whether to ask for independent 
counsels to investigate other issues connected with White House fund-raising, 
but tonight, the vice president at least, is knows he can enjoy his 
Thanksgiving. The Peter.
