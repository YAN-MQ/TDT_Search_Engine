In the beginning, there was simply ``The End.'' Now, there are gaffers, 
best boys and Celine Dion. Hollywood movie credits, which began as 
modest lists, have grown over the years into lumbering behemoths as 
extravagant _ and seemingly as time-consuming _ as the films they 
accompany. ``End credits have become completely absurd,'' said Andrew 
Sarris, the film critic of The New York Observer. ``There was one 
movie _ I don't remember the name _ where the credits went on and 
on. I happened to be tired and just sat there. And one of the credit 
lines was, `If you left at the beginning of these credits, you'd be 
home by now.' '' For today's movie directors, end titles have become 
a place simultaneously to acknowledge indebtedness, flaunt the size 
of one's budget, make a final bid to woo audiences and, occasionally, 
to have a good time. Moviegoers, for their part, must now routinely 
decide whether to stay till the last gaffer has gasped his last gasp 
or to unstick their feet from the floor and flee as soon as the credits 
begin. ``I think you can tell how much people like the movie by the 
percentage of the audience that stays,'' said the director John Waters, 
whose most recent film is ``Pecker.'' ``If the entire audience jumps 
up when the credit roll starts, then they didn't like the movie.'' 
Among recent contenders, the hands-down favorite for sheer credit 
volume is the 197-minute, $200-million ``Titanic.'' Its final credit 
crawl acknowledges (among hundreds of others) Steward No. 4 and Slovakian 
3-Year-Old Boy; First-Class Husband and Third-Class Woman; a Drapes 
Master and Drapes Assistants; Production Accountants and Construction 
Accountants; a Children's Guardian, some Lead Inferno Artists and 
a Union Doctor; a Water Systems Engineer and a Tank Technician; Lifeguards, 
Model Makers and a Choreographer/Etiquette Coach. The diamond necklace 
is by Asprey London and the cast album by Sony Classical; thank-you's 
go to the Mexican Minister of Tourism and the Nova Scotia Film Commission 
_ all scrolling by as Ms. Dion bleats out the film's treacly anthem. 
Seven and a half minutes have seldom felt longer. ``That's all right,'' 
Waters said. ``Because then all those people who are sobbing can pull 
themselves together: the women to fix their makeup, the men to blot 
away the tears so they're not embarrassed.'' It wasn't always this 
way. Early silent films barely had credits at all. By the 1920s, movies 
would open with a short list, usually lasting less than a minute, 
naming the principal actors, the director and the producer. Closing 
credits were almost nonexistent. Gradually, as a way of reinforcing 
stars' names in the public mind, cast lists began to be reiterated 
_ briefly _ at the end of movies. In the early 1930s, Universal Studios 
started prefacing its closing credits with the signature line ``A 
Good Cast Is Worth Repeating.'' (The phrase was dusted off this year 
for ``Gods and Monsters,'' about James Whale, the director of the 
first first two Universal ``Frankenstein'' films.) Literary adaptations 
might acknowledge their source material as well, sometimes with hilarious 
results. ``Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks did a 1929 version 
of `Taming of the Shrew,' '' Sarris said. ``And the credit read: `Play 
by William Shakespeare. Additional Dialogue by Sam Taylor.' '' Except 
for the wardrobe designer, members of the technical crew were seldom 
billed. Camera operators, sound men and the like were employees of 
the studios; their weekly paycheck was deemed sufficient credit. But 
over the years, as the studio system crumbled and the apparatus of 
moviemaking grew larger, opening credits became more crowded. ``Casablanca'' 
(1942) is typical of its day. Besides the actors, producer and director, 
the opening credits acknowledge a dialogue director, a makeup artist, 
``gowns,'' ``montages'' and ``orchestral arrangements,'' all in just 
over a minute. The closing credit? Still a simple ``The End.'' In 
the 1950s and 60s, new cinematic technologies gave opening credits 
even more to account for. The credits of ``An Affair to Remember'' 
(1957) are nearly two minutes long and, right up front with Cary Grant 
and Deborah Kerr, give the nod to ``Cinemascope Lenses by Bausch &AMP; 
Lomb,'' ``Color by De Luxe'' and the title song, ``sung by Vic Damone.'' 
It's a wonder anyone stuck around to watch the movie. The longer credits 
also reflected larger changes in the moviegoing experience. ``I grew 
up in the 30s and 40s in the age of double features,'' Sarris said. 
``In those days, they showed a lot of other things: newsreels, sometimes 
short subjects, cartoons. They had free-plate night and sweepstakes. 
So it was a very cluttered evening in the theater. And the tendency 
of the studios was not to add to the clutter with a lot of titles.'' 
But with the rise of television and the resulting decline of B movies, 
a single feature eventually had to carry an entire bill. Expanding 
the opening credits helped flesh out the evening. By the 1950s, the 
best of these credit sequences were art forms unto themselves: witness 
the stunning title designs of Saul Bass (``Vertigo,'' ``Anatomy of 
a Murder'') and, in the 60s and 70s, the jazzy, animated openings 
of the ``Pink Panther'' films. If a movie's credits were especially 
unwieldy, a director could choose to open with a precredit sequence 
designed to reel audiences into the narrative before the onslaught 
of names began. Sometimes, as in ``The Horse Whisperer,'' the whole 
film is a precredit sequence, with the title appearing only at the 
end. The growing clout of Hollywood labor unions also meant longer 
credits. Today, under the rules of the Screen Actors Guild, an actor 
who utters even a word on camera must often be billed. Then there 
are the crew members, like the gaffer (the chief electrician), best 
boy (an assistant or apprentice), key grip (the head handyman) and 
Foley artist (who creates postproduction sound effects). The law requires 
that producers add copyright acknowledgments for songs on the soundtrack. 
And for films shot on location, courtesy may compel heartfelt thanks 
to the citizenry of entire burgs. By the 70s and 80s, films threatened 
to bog down under the accumulated weight of their opening credits. 
``Somewhere along the line, all of this material, which would include 
drivers and caterers, got pushed to the end,'' said Damien Bona, a 
co-author of ``Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy 
Awards.'' ``Now in the opening credits, one tends to get only `major 
workers' on the film.'' With the credits shunted to the back, contemporary 
filmmakers must resort to tricks to induce the audience to stay. Some, 
like Peter and Bobby Farrelly (``There's Something About Mary''), 
leaven their credits with snippets from the cutting-room floor. The 
martial arts virtuoso Jackie Chan (``Rush Hour'') intercuts outtakes 
of stunts that went comically _ sometimes painfully _ awry. Comedy 
directors, like the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker (``Airplane!''), 
may weave pseudocredits (``Topping for Brownies,'' ``Things To Do 
After the Movie'') in among the real ones. ``By making the credits 
interesting, you are enabling people to see the so-called `little 
people' that worked on the movie,'' Waters said. ``So a director that 
does that is being very supportive of his crew.'' Waters himself is 
no stranger to artful closing credits. At the end of ``Serial Mom,'' 
for instance, he ran a line that read, ``No Flies Were Harmed in the 
Making of This Film.'' Closing credits are also a last chance for 
the filmmaker to seduce the audience. ``The most important thing with 
any movie is word of mouth; (italics)that(end italics) you cannot 
buy,'' Waters said. ``So when those credits come on, that's when people 
are thinking whether they liked it or not and what they're going to 
say to the person they're with. That's the beginning of word of mouth.'' 
A director doesn't need deep pockets to have long credits. ``It's 
not just the big-budget movies with 2,000 special effects and the 
big rock tunes: it's also the small independent movies that look like 
they were made in a garage,'' Sarris said. ``They credit somebody 
who lent the beach chairs for the beach scene and also people who 
lent moral encouragement.'' And in a medium where product endorsements 
have become ever more blatant, producers are only too happy to give 
credit where credit is due _ if it means they can snag a freebie in 
return. Bona savors the memory of one such acknowledgment, from the 
credits of ``He Knows You're Alone,'' a 1981 slasher picture most 
notable for being Tom Hanks's first film. ``In the listing of special 
thanks,'' Bona recalled, ``the producers gave special thanks to the 
Hoffritz cutlery company.'' Cut.
