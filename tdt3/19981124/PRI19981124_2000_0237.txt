The nation's economic growth picked up strongly over the second quarter, 
despite the financial crisis overseas. The Commerce Department said 
its latest estimate showed the economy growing at 3.9 percent from 
July through September -- even better than previously thought. The 
report said the estimate of gross domestic product was revised upward 
because the nation's trade deficit didn't widen as much as predicted, 
and consumers bought more trucks and used cars than the first report 
showed.
