Saddam Hussein is making sweeping changes to his diplomatic team. 
The Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, nizar Hamdoon, is being 
replaced. The Iraqi president hopes a new representative may have 
more luck convincing the U.N. to lift sanctions. Hamdoon will be replaced 
by his deputy. 18 ambassadors are being replaced in all, including 
the Iraqi U.N. representative in Geneva and the representative to 
the Arab league.
