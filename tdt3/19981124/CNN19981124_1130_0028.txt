First -- the government has announced a safety recall of nearly 10 
million playpens. Eight children have died since 1982 when pacifier 
strings or loose clothing got caught on metal rivets sticking out 
of the playpens. Some of the recalled portable mesh playpens were 
manufactured 40 years ago, others as recently as may. The brand names 
included in the recall are bilt-rite, evenflow, Gerry, graco, kolcraft, 
playskool, pride-trimble and strolee. Consumers can call -- 1-800-794-4415
