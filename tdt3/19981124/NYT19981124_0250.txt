Every time a movie like ``Home Fries'' appears, you can sense Hollywood's 
eagerness for a smart screwball comedy that hits the commercial bull's-eye 
and proves that there really is a place for sophisticated humor in 
a market dominated by the dumbed-down capers of the Farrelly brothers, 
Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler. ``Home Fries'' probably isn't that movie. 
But this absurdist satire of sex, sibling rivalry, Oedipal ties, homicidal 
fantasies and fast food in the American heartland at least has the 
right attitude. It just isn't funny enough in its particulars to make 
you break up laughing. The first feature film directed by Dean Parisot 
(from a screenplay by Vince Gilligan), ``Home Fries'' belongs to the 
same comic genre as ``Clay Pigeons,'' another intelligent but not 
terribly funny dark comedy that opened in September and quickly disappeared. 
Both films throw together an unlikely assortment of familiar American 
types and let them all go a little crazy. At the center of the goofy 
psychological maelstrom in ``Home Fries'' is Sally Jackson (Drew Barrymore), 
a worker at a rural Burger-Matic who is carrying the baby of a married 
man. In the movie's opening scenes, the reluctant father-to-be is 
pursued, driven off the road and literally scared to death by two 
men in a helicopter. The pilots, Dorian (Luke Wilson) and Angus (Jake 
Busey), both Army National Guardsmen, turn out to be the victim's 
two stepsons, acting on the orders of their mother (Catherine O'Hara) 
to scare her cheating husband back into being faithful. The boys, 
being dutiful, God-fearing sons devoted to Mom and apple pie, wouldn't 
think of disobeying her. But during their mission they hear strange 
voices on the helicopter's radio. Realizing later that the voices 
could conceivably be witnesses against them in a murder trial, they 
decide to investigate the source. Taking a job at the Burger-Matic 
where the employees communicate on radio headsets, Dorian determines 
to find out who heard what. There he meets and is immediately infatuated 
with his late stepfather's very pregnant girlfriend. Most of the humor 
of ``Home Fries'' comes from the collision of caricatures who suggest 
refugees from ``Tobacco Road'' reinvented for a 1990s version of the 
classic '70s sitcom ``Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.'' The two young 
pilots are revealed to be nursing a fierce sibling rivalry that eventually 
erupts into another mad helicopter chase. Their mother _ fluttery 
and scatterbrained one minute, poisonous the next _ is a trailer-trash 
version of a classic Southern belle. Sally, who lives in a dilapidated 
shack with her eccentric mother and drunken father, is by far the 
sanest character in this crazed bunch. In a sweet, understated performance, 
Ms. Barrymore makes Sally the movie's likable common-sense grounding 
wire. If ``Home Fries'' evokes a cultural climate overheated with 
tabloid television and talk show melodrama, its humor lacks teeth. 
By the end of the movie, you almost long for the gross-out shenanigans 
that comedies aiming a little lower deliver with such leering gusto. 
One good salacious joke in ``Home Fries'' would have helped a lot. 
``Home Fries'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has 
some strong language. PRODUCTION NOTES: HOME FRIES: Directed by Dean
