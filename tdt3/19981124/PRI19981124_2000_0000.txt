This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and 
WGBH Boston. Today is Tuesday, November 24. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. 
Coming up -- Palestinians celebrate the opening of their first airport. 
Also, a Cuban-born ballerina celebrates the return to her homeland. 
So to come back and dance finally, you know, the thing that I've done 
my entire life all over the world except the place where I was born, 
that's something that I just feel very deeply. Advice on dealing with 
Saddam Hussein from a man who's had to, and ideas on converting a 
nuclear bunker from a man who wants to rent out some prime space underground. 
First, though, this news.
