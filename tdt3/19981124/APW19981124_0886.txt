With contacts severed between Angolan forces and the head of the former 
rebel movement UNITA, prospects for restarting Angola's peace process 
look bleak, the United Nations said in a report Tuesday. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan said he was extremely concerned about the stalled process 
and deteriorating situation in the southwestern African nation and 
warned again that the U.N. observer mission may have to reduce its 
presence if security doesn't improve. While UNITA is primarily responsible 
for the stalled implementation of the 1994 peace accord, the government's 
rejection of all contact with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi ``is not 
likely to advance the cause of peace and national reconciliation, 
at least in the foreseeable future,'' Annan said. And with preparations 
for a military showdown continuing, the United Nations is ``unable 
to carry out most of its mandated tasks, and the prospects for reactivating 
the peace process look bleak,'' Annan concluded. The United Nations 
mediated the so-called Lusaka Protocol between Angola and UNITA in 
1994 to end nearly two decades of civil war, which erupted after the 
country's 1975 independence from Portugal. About 500,000 people are 
thought to have died in the fighting. But the accord has been unraveling 
recently with reports of skirmishes between the two sides and the 
government's refusal to deal any longer with Savimbi. Instead, the 
government has recognized a group of UNITA dissidents as the legitimate 
representatives of the group. UNITA is a Portuguese acronym for the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. The United Nations 
says Savimbi is still the legitimate partner in the peace process 
and has refused to recognize the new group, though the U.N. envoy 
has met with its members. Annan reported that he hadn't received any 
clarification to a reported statement by a government official Nov. 
20 that said that unless U.N. officials and the three countries overseeing 
the peace process _ the United States, Russia and Portugal _ participate 
with the dissidents in a meeting, the government would resolve the 
remaining issues alone. Annan also recommended that the mandate of 
the U.N. observer mission be extended for up to three months.
