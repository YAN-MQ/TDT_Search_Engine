Riot police used water cannon, horses and dogs Tuesday to break up 
a demonstration by dozens of protesting pig farmers who had blockaded 
a road in a rural town, according to news reports. One farmer reportedly 
was injured. About 50 police advanced under a barrage of stones and 
bottles to clear the road at Rio Maior, about 60 kilometers (36 miles) 
north of Lisbon, television station TV Independente reported from 
the town. A protesting farmer was knocked unconscious and was taken 
away by ambulance,. It was not clear how he was injured, TV Independente 
said. Television pictures showed riot police with shields and batons 
advancing across a roadblock of boulders and small fires to disperse 
the farmers shortly after nightfall. The farmers spent most of the 
day in the town where they gathered to protest falling pork prices. 
In recent weeks, the farmers have released piglets in the center of 
major cities to pressure the government into giving them more financial 
aid.
