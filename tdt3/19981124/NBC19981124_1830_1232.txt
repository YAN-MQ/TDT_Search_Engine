The desperate state of Russian democracy was on display in St. Petersburg 
today. Thousands gathered for the funeral of Galina starovoitova, 
one of the russian parliament's highest profile democratic reformers. 
She was murdered on the steps of her apartment building last Friday. 
Police say they have no idea who killed her, but many Russians say 
there's no doubt it was a politically motivated contract hit.
