Spain's Carlos Sainz broke down just 300 meters (yards) from the finish 
line of the final stage of Britain's season-ending Network Q Rally 
Tuesday, handing Tommi Makinen a record third straight world title. 
Sainz, going for this third world title and his first since 1992, 
was robbed of the title when the engine in his Toyota caught fire. 
Sainz was set to finish the race in the fourth place or better he 
needed to claim the title. Richard Burns of Britain won the rally. 
Sainz was left in tears on the roadside as co-driver Luis Moya smashed 
his crash helmet to the ground in frustration. The Madrid native entered 
the season's final rally trailing Tommi Makinen by two points in the 
season standings. But the Finn _ bidding for a record third consecutive 
world title _ slid out of the race on Sunday when he skidded on a 
patch of oil and hit a concrete pillar. By not finishing the race, 
Sainz remained two points behind Makinen in the final season points 
standings. MORE
