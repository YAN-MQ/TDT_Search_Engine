An Oakland county, Michigan, prosecutor says he will decide whether 
to charge Dr. Jack Kevorkian in the death of a man with Lou Gehrig's 
disease only after he sees a controversial videotape. Kevorkian gave 
the CBS program "60 minutes" a tape which showed him actually making 
the lethal injection. In past cases, patients have used devices to 
begin the process themselves. Kevorkian's attorney says he plans to 
give police a copy of the tape as early as Tuesday. It's not about 
publicity. It's about getting the issue discussed and getting the 
issue out into the open, because in an enlightened society, we shouldn't 
allow individuals to suffer. We shouldn't allow them to have to suffer 
just because some parts of society, the vocal minority of society, 
is saying that this is inappropriate. Kevorkian says he has helped 
about 120 people commit suicide. If he is ever convicted, he says 
he will, "starve to death in prison."
