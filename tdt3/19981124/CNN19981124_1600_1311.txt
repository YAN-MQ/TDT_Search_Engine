Hats off to the gritty drew Bledsoe. After fracturing his right index 
finger last night, he rallied the Patriots to a 26-23 must win over 
Miami. And as if that weren't enough, Bledsoe intends to play Sunday 
against the bills. There is no time to be euphoric about this. We 
had our fun last night, and the guys get the day off today to get 
back. And then we're going as of tomorrow, and we got to get it done 
again. So -- but I kind of like the fact that we do have a shot at 
Buffalo right now.
