Russian politicians attending the funeral of slain lawmaker Galina 
Starovoitova have vowed that her murder will not scare them into abandoning 
Democratic reform. VOA Correspondent Peter Heimline attended the funeral 
in Russia's second city, St. Petersburg, earlier on Tuesday. Galina 
Starovoitova was laid to rest at the exclusive cemetery where such 
famous Russians as composer Pyotr Tchaikovski and author Fyodor Dostoyevsky 
are buried. The liberal lawmaker was gunned down outside her St. Petersburg 
apartment Friday in what authorities say was a contract killing. At 
a memorial service, former deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais accused 
what he called Communists and bandits of responsibility for her death. 
He said, "They are killing our comrades, our friends. Do they want 
to scare us?" He added, "Whoever tries to stop what we have accomplished 
will fail." The service was attended by three former prime ministers 
and a host of other former officials. In contrast, Miss Starovoitova's 
fellow lawmakers and members of the current government largely stayed 
away. Peter Heimline, VOA News, St. Petersburg.
