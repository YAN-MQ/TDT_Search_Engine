Up next, who's making those decisions about your health? Life and 
death? Still ahead, holiday mailing season is here. I know a place... 
American's love scenery. We can't get enough of it we don't care how 
far it is... we want to see it all. Good thing there's Chevy Malibu. 
A car designed to take us anywhere and back. It'll actually go up 
to 100,000 miles before its first scheduled tuneup. That's a lot of 
vacations. and a lot of souvenirs. So take the long way home. It's 
the car you knew America could build. Malibu. Genuine Chevrolet. I'll 
take you there.
