Business news now. On Wall Street today, the Dow Jones Industrials 
surrendered 20 -- make that 73 points to close at 9301. The NASDAQ 
also lost 11 points to close at 1966. Despite the down day, the Dow 
is staying above the 9000 level, boosted by a couple of big mergers 
announced this week. Yesterday, Germany's Deutsche Bank announced 
a takeover of the eighth largest banking company in the United States, 
Bankers Trust. And today, America Online and Netscape made their $4 
billion merger deal official. It's all welcome news for investors, 
as Liz George tells us from our business desk in New York. Brokers 
are taking their profits ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but stocks 
remain powered upwards by news of global mergers and economic confidence. 
John Riding is the senior economist at Bear Stearns. During August 
and September, a lot of cash has built up, and what's fueling the 
markets is that cash being put to work. I think another important 
component to that may be overseas. We're starting to see a stronger 
dollar now, and we may pull in foreign investors again into the U.S. 
and that may be at the margin the extra source of buying that could 
push us to new highs in the market in early 1999. So is this the end 
of the global economic crisis? Have we turned the corner, or are we 
likely to have a soft landing in the new year? Those concerns are 
still there, and the major division -- the major battle line will 
still remain Brazil, whether the Brazilian currency and financial 
restructuring plan will hold together. There's also a sense that what's 
going on in Asia is indicating that the worst is starting to be behind 
them. The Asian development bank releasing a new forecast that shows 
growth in Asia in 1999 versus a contraction in 1998. Now, that's not 
unwinding all of the bad things that have happened. But it's certainly 
stemming the outflow of economic activity that seems to be close to 
being behind us. Figures released in the U.S. today show consumer 
spending still going strong, pumped up by low interest rates and no 
inflation. And even more surprising is the increase in exports -- 
higher than was expected. For The World, I'm Liz George in New York.
