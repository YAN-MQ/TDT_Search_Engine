Internet stocks were among the biggest winners Monday, with some company 
gains in the double digits. Bill Tucker has more. High-tech stocks 
caught the same merger fever that drove the blue chips to record highs 
Monday. News that America online is in talks to buy Netscape sent 
Internet stocks soaring. The online auction company E-bay -- and this 
is not a typo -- soared $46 a Share. That company went public at $18 
a share in September. Amazon.com soared $37 and change, and Yahoo 
gained more than $30 a share, as investors bet on a continued Internet 
explosion. The Internet is on a secular growth curve that's independent 
of the economy. It's just like, I think, the cable networks were in 
the mid-80s. It's just like bio-tech was when we were going through 
a recession in 1991. They're getting funding. The Internet is growing. 
Corporate America is embracing them. The Internet gains were part 
of a broad-based rally for the nASDAQ composite. It closed at 1977 
on a gain of 49 points. Volume was a heavy 951 million shares. The 
NASDAQ's big caps also did their part. Microsoft gained more than 
$5 a share. Intel more than $1. And Cisco, whose routers carry 85% 
of the Internet, rose to a 52-week high. This huge rally still leaves 
the composite 37 points shy of its all-time high reached in late July, 
when the NASDAQ peaked at 2014. Bill Tucker, "CNN Financial News,"
