Hundreds of Indonesian students returned to the streets of Jakarta 
today to hold a peaceful rally. They were demanding the ouster of 
Indonesia's military chief. NPR's Julie McCarthy reports from Jakarta. 
Some 500 flag-waving students marched under the hot sun to the capital's 
central square Monosque, distributing stickers that said, "Violence 
is not the way out." Their advance to Monosque, the scene of demonstrations 
at crucial junctures in Indonesia's history, was halted, and the protesters 
remained behind the police cordon. More students converged on the 
office of the attorney general, demanding that former president Suharto 
be brought to justice. They appealed for a meeting and got one. However, 
Attorney General Andy Galig would not commit to putting Suharto on 
trial within the next month. Students from the Jakarta Art Institute, 
clad in black, gathered at a busy round-about in the city center to 
mourn the victims of a military crackdown on students earlier in the 
month. Office workers scurried past, while soldiers stood at the ready 
as the students staged a mock funeral. This is Julie McCarthy, NPR 
News, Jakarta.
