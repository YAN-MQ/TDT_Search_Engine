It looks as if ``A Bug's Life,'' from the computer-animation outfit 
Pixar and some of the personnel behind ``Toy Story,'' is the best 
ant colony movie of the year. And that's no small distinction, considering 
the bug-eat-bug movie rivalry under way. Both this and the uncannily 
similar ``Antz'' are sophisticated, entertaining feats of animation, 
but ``A Bug's Life'' has the conceptual edge as a clearly defined 
family film (as opposed to the more verbally adult, yet visually youth-oriented 
``Antz''). As directed by John Lasseter, who directed ``Toy Story,'' 
and Andrew Stanton, who collaborated on the ``Toy Story'' screenplay, 
``A Bug's Life'' makes jaunty, imaginative use of both extraordinary 
technology and bold storytelling possibilities within the insect world. 
At first ``A Bug's Life'' looks disappointingly familiar, as one more 
line of identical insect drones trudges across the screen. ``Antz'' 
started with the same collective mentality and then invoked bugs with 
star personalities (Woody Allen in one of his funniest recent performances) 
to deliver some zest. But this time the ants' story is more coherent 
on its own terms, so the audience is more caught up in narrative than 
in all-star individual characters. Also, ``A Bug's Life'' shows off 
the same shrewd anthropomorphism that gave ``Toy Story'' so much spark. 
Though no children's film is without tyrants these days, and the bullies 
here are towering grasshoppers (with Kevin Spacey nice and threatening 
as their ringleader), ``A Bug's Life'' is still relatively benign. 
It concerns a whimsical, daydreamy ant named Flik (with the voice 
of Dave Foley) who accidentally runs afoul of the grasshoppers. Clinging 
to a sprig of dandelion fuzz and blowing off into the wind, Flik sets 
out to find reinforcements who will help defend the ant colony, but 
he accidentally comes across a bug circus. With these show-biz types, 
there's a bit of misunderstanding about what ``knock 'em dead'' means. 
The circus clowns (with Denis Leary as a macho ladybug, David Hyde 
Pierce as a stick-shaped bug, Bonnie Hunt as a black widow spider 
and Madeline Kahn as a butterfly) show off some hilarious teamwork 
before being reluctantly dragged into the ant colony's troubles. Meanwhile, 
Phyllis Diller supplies the voice of an ant queen with a flower for 
a hairdo, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus frets charmingly as the princess 
who's sweet on Flik. There's no real need to know more than this except 
that the material combines pastel colors, natural settings and vibrant, 
comical insects into a spectacle that lots of children ought to find 
irresistible. The film's message about standing up for freedom is 
similar to that of ``Antz,'' but it's delivered with less strife and 
a lighter hand. ``A Bug's Life'' is being shown with Pixar's Academy 
Award-winning short, ``Geri's Game,'' in which an old man playing 
chess imagines a doppelganger partner for himself and is then carried 
away by the excitement of the game. It's a showcase for the incredible 
range of facial expressions that make this type of animation more 
and more invitingly lifelike all the time. Although ``A Bug's Life'' 
is rated G, it includes big, scary grasshoppers who are sure to get 
their comeuppance in the end. PRODUCTION NOTES: `A BUG'S LIFE' Directed
