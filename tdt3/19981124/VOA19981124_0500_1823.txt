Hello, again. From Washington, I'm Charlene Porter, along with Paul 
Westfeeling, on News Now. With Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, a 
group of dignitaries, and hundreds of on-lookers on hand, the $250 
million Gaza International Airport opened, Tuesday. As VOA's David 
Gullis reports, from Gaza, officials call this and historic moment 
for the Palestinians. An Egyptian jetliner, carrying a delegation 
of senior officials, and members of parliament from Cairo, was the 
first to land here. And, it was followed by a succession of flights 
from Arab countries, and Western Europe. Commercial service at the 
airport will not actually begin for another few weeks. But, the ceremonial 
opening triggered celebrations by Palestinians, who see it as another 
step towards the statehood they aspire to, as early as next year. 
Several hundred Palestinians, government officials, but also ordinary 
citizens from the nearby town of Conunis milled about the tarmac where 
the aircraft were parked. Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, personally 
welcomed the arriving delegations. He called the airport opening an 
important step in implementing last month's U.S. Brokard Y River agreement, 
which also produced the first Israeli hand over of land to the Palestinians 
in the West Bank, in nearly two years. The completed airport had sat 
vacant for many months, amid disputes between Israel and the Palestinians, 
over Israel's role in monitoring passengers and cargo. Israeli security 
officials will have a role in passenger inspections, and its aviation 
officials will sit along side Palestinians in the control tower. But, 
it will, nonetheless, mean expedited travel for Palestinians, who 
have either had to go to Jordan or Egypt for international flights, 
or apply to enter Israel to use Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv. 
The airport also opens up new possibilities for importing and exporting 
goods from Palestinian areas, without the expensive and time consuming 
practice of shipping through Israel. Underlining that problem, Palestinian 
officials say equipment for the airport control tower, computers for 
passenger check-in encounters, and flood-lights for the runway and 
tarmac, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdad -- their delivery 
delayed by custom's red tape. David Gullis, VOA News at the Palestinian 
airport in Gaza.
