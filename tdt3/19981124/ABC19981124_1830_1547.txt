Finally tonight, it's "your money." Another chapter on how the government 
spend or in some cases, loses, your tax dollars. Tonight, a crime 
that costs millions of dollars and takes a toll on the environment, 
too. This is about trees, cut down and stolen from national forests. 
ABC's James Walker reports from the pacific northwest. In central 
Oregon last year, a national forest was looted. Where are the big 
trees? The big trees that should have been left there are gone. Paul 
Dewey, an environmental lawyer, says they've been illegally cut down. 
What we should be able to see as we clear this off is blue paint at 
the base of the tree. Which would be a forest service marker that 
this tree is okay to cut. Right. And there's no blue int on this, 
none. The forest service knows it was ripped off. According to documents 
obtained the governmt accountability project, the service found that 
seven trees here had been removed illegally. But an experienced investigator 
examined the site for ABC News and discovered much more. He asked 
not to be identified. I found hundreds of trees that appeared to be 
removed without authorization. A lot of them are worth $1,000 to $1,500 
a piece. Ens housandsllolen from the federal treasury is In 1993, 
the forest service did set up a special unit to investigate the big, 
organized schemes to steal timber. And it worked. The team recovered 
millions of dollars and put people in jail. But within two years, 
the forest service abruptly shut the unit down. Investigations that 
were under way have stalled. Right now there is no means in the system 
to tackle those types of investigations. The forest service refused 
to talk to us but has said it can't afford a special timber theft 
unit. Jim maher, a former federal prosecutor, says historically, the 
forest service has just been too cozy with the logging industry. If 
you wanted to be more accurate, you would say the forest service timber 
management was largely in bed with many of the timber companies. So 
how much money have taxpayers lost? Estimates are as much as $100 
million a year. That's a lot of "your money." James Walker, ABC News, 
in central Oregon.
