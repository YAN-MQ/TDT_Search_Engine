Mike Jarvis could not be happier. His St. John's team is playing excellent 
basketball, and he is about to make his Madison Square Garden debut 
in a situation that will almost certainly work in his club's favor. 
In competing in this week's power-packed Chase National Invitation 
Tournament, St. John's can go no place but up. Respectable losses 
to Stanford, North Carolina or Purdue, all ranked above No. 23 St. 
John's, would do nothing to harm the Red Storm's confidence or march 
back toward national acclaim. On the other hand, a victory in the 
tournament would catapult the Red Storm into the national spotlight. 
``If we beat Stanford by even a half-point, the nation will take notice,'' 
Jarvis quipped Tuesday at a news conference at the Marriott Marquis 
hotel. With four of the top 25, and three of the top 15 teams in college 
basketball's sea of parity, the tournament should be something special. 
In Wednesday night's first game, at 6 p.m., St. John's (3-0) faces 
Stanford, which is also 3-0 and ranked third by the Associated Press 
poll but first in eight other national polls. No. 9 North Carolina 
(3-0) and No. 14 Purdue (4-0) will play at 8:30. The championship 
game will be Friday night. Stanford, with all five starters and 11 
lettermen back from last year's Final Four finisher, is out to show 
that it can thrive as something other than the underdog. Led by the 
senior point guard Arthur Lee, the 6-foot-8 junior forward Mark Madsen 
and the 7-1 center Tim Young _ all-America candidates all _ the Cardinal 
will be tough for St. John's. With Young, Madsen and five other players 
taller than 6-7, Stanford will have a tremendous size advantage, and 
Lee and backcourt mate Kris Weems should be able to handle the Red 
Storm's attempt to take advantage of its quickness. Wednesday night's 
game will serve as a solid test for St. John's rising stars, the sophomore 
forward Ron Artest and the freshman point guard Erick Barkley. Artest 
will face the Cardinal's physical, fundamentally sound front line, 
while Barkley will face-off with Lee. North Carolina and Purdue are 
hoping to find their identities. After losing the all-Americans Antawn 
Jamison and Vince Carter to the NBA, North Carolina is being forced 
to rely on freshmen for one of the few times in its history. The freshman 
forwards Jason Capel and Kris Lang will play significant roles, while 
the junior point guard Ed Cota and the senior forward Ademola Okulaja, 
the club's only returning starters, provide leadership. Cota, a Brooklyn 
native who led the Atlantic Coast Conference in assists the last two 
years, is being asked to score for the first time since high school. 
Purdue has solid players in guard Jaraan Cornell and forwards Brian 
Cardinal and Mike Robinson but the Boilermakers lack star power.
