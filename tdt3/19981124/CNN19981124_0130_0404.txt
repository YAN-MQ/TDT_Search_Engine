The federal government has received a grade of "D" for its efforts 
to prepare its computers for the year 2000. In its final report of 
the year, a house panel says one out of three government computers 
will not be fixed in time. Computers worldwide are expected to crash 
on January 1st, 2000 because their internal clocks will read January 
1st, 1900. The house report says the agencies with the biggest problems 
include the departments of health and human services and the department 
of energy.
