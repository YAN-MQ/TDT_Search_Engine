Two people were killed and scores injured Tuesday when a car bomb 
exploded in front of the German Embassy, witnesses said. The bomb 
shattered windows and sent shards of glass flying into the embassy 
and damaged parts of the wall, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. The two Yemenis who died were pedestrians passing by 
the embassy. About six people were taken by ambulance to hospitals, 
and many others suffered minor wounds. The Mazda carrying the bomb 
was parked outside the embassy in the residential Hadda area, where 
most embassies are located. The site has been cordoned off by police, 
who are not allowing anyone to enter or leave the area. No other details 
were available, and police would not comment on the incident.
