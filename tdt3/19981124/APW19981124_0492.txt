Defending champion Italy beat Russia 15-3, 15-8, 11-15, 15-9 Tuesday 
and remained unbeaten at 5-0 with two matches left in the round that 
decides the semifinalists of the Men's World Volleyball Championships. 
Italy, seeking to become the first men's team ever to win three consecutive 
world titles, needed one hour, 47 minutes to defeat Russia, fourth 
in the 1996 Olympics and seventh in the previous championships in 
1994. Yugoslavia, the Olympic bronze medalist, also improved to 5-0 
by beating the Netherlands, the Olympic champion, 15-9, 15-4, 15-13 
in another Group H match. The Netherlands and Russia both were 4-1, 
and the group's other teams _ Greece, Ukraine, the United States and 
China were out of semifinal contention. On Tuesday, Ukraine scored 
a 15-12, 4-15, 15-12, 6-15, 15-8 victory over the United States, which 
won a bronze medal in the previous tournament in 1994 but is winless 
in second-round play this time. ``I am really happy with this victory, 
but I know we could have played better,'' said Leonid Likhno, the 
Ukraine team's head coach. American head coach Doug Beal said, ``We 
had a really uneven match. Sometimes we were playing really well but 
it didn't last. Ukraine is a very good team. They had many close matches 
in this tournament.'' Greece beat winless China 12-15, 15-11, 15-8, 
15-12. In Group G at Osaka, western Japan, only Brazil stayed undefeated, 
handing Cuba its first loss, 15-11, 15-7, 15-2 in one hour, 15 minutes. 
The Cuban women's team defended its world title on Nov. 12. Spain 
defeated Argentina 6-15, 15-6, 17-15, 15-5 and was with Cuba at 4-1. 
Bulgaria defeated Canada 15-6, 15-9, 15-12, and South Korea beat winless 
Japan 15-13, 15-8, 8-15, 9-15, 15-12. Argentina, Bulgaria and Canada 
were at 2-3. The men's championship started Nov. 13 with 24 teams, 
and 16 advanced to the current round, which lasts until Thursday. 
The semifinals and finals will be played in Tokyo Saturday and Sunday.
