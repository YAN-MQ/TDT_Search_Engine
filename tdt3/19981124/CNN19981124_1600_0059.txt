Now, back to Wall Street, where the stock market came up a bit short 
today. Preliminary closing numbers show the Dow Jones industrial average 
is down approximately 74 points from yesterday's record close of 374. 
Blue chip stocks recovered this afternoon from an early 81-point loss. 
But they fell back in the final minutes of trading. Broader markets 
were lower as well.
