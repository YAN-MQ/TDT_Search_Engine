Foreigners account for one in five of the Swiss population _ one of 
the top rates in Europe _ according to a government study presented 
Tuesday. The Federal Statistics Office said that of the 1.5 million 
foreigners, only 82,000 were asylum seekers. Many of the others have 
been in Switzerland for many years. Geneva, which is home to U.N. 
and other international organizations, has the highest rate of foreigners 
at 37 percent, according to the study. It said that only tiny Luxembourg 
and Liechtenstein had more foreigners in relation to the number of 
their nationals.
