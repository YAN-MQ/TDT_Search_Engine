United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has recommended that the 
mandate of peacekeepers in Angola be extended by three months to prevent 
a return of civil war. Mr. Annan said the overall situation in Angola 
has deteriorated since the middle of last month when the U.N. Security 
Council extended the mandate of the peacekeepers by six weeks. Mr. 
Annan said the dialogue between Luanda and the former rebel group 
UNITA has ceased.
