Open positions of short sales on the Nasdaq stock market fell 2 percent 
in the most recent monthly period, the National Association of Securities 
Dealers, which oversees the market, reported Tuesday. It was the first 
time in the last 12 months that short-interest positions have declined 
for two consecutive periods. In the month ended Nov. 13, uncovered 
short positions totaled 2.01 billion shares, down from 2.05 billion 
shares in the previous month. A short position is created when an 
investor sells shares that have been borrowed. If the share price 
falls, the investor can profit by buying shares at a lower price to 
replace the borrowed ones. Conversely, if the shares rise in price, 
the short-seller faces a loss. Uncovered short sales, or those with 
open positions, are those shares that have been borrowed and sold 
but not yet covered by repurchase. For the second month, the largest 
short position on Nasdaq was Dell Computer. But the stock, whose price 
rose sharply in the period, also recorded the biggest decrease in 
open short positions. Short positions in Dell totaled 35.8 million 
shares, a drop of 18.9 million shares, or 34 percent, from the previous 
month.
