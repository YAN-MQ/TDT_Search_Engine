The holiday season, it's upon us, and expectations are that customers 
will not only flock to the stores, but open their pocketbooks to spend, 
spend, spend. The holiday shopping season official aye begins this 
Friday, the day after thanksgiving. It's also known by many retailers 
as black Friday because it helps push them into the black. A healthy 
stock market, high consumer confidence, and low interest rates all 
expected to aid to the profitability of the holiday shopping season.
