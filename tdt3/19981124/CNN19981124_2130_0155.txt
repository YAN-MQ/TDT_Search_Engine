More than three dozen hours of recordings are offering a glimpse into 
a Long-lost era known as "Camelot." The John F. Kennedy library released 
the tapes from his presidency today. They include recordings of telephone 
conversations between president kennedy and former presidents Hoover, 
truman and Eisenhower about the Cuban missile crisis. Another excerpt 
refers to the coup against south Vietnam's president in 1963 weeks 
before Kennedy himself was assassinated. He seems to regret his actions 
preceding the overthrow. I feel that we must bear a good deal of responsibility, 
in part beginning with our cable of early August, in which we suggested 
the coup, period. In my judgment, that wire was badly drafted, comma, 
it should never have been sent. A historian at the Kennedy library 
says the president knew he was being taped but didn't realize the 
recordings would be made public.
