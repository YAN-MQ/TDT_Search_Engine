Hot air-ballooning British entrepreneur Richard Branson is exploring 
the skies over West Africa and a possible cooperative venture between 
his Virgin Atlantic Airways and Ghana's national air carrier. Branson 
met with representatives from Ghana Airways and the Civil Aviation 
Authority to discuss possible investment opportunities, a spokesman 
for Branson said Tuesday. Ghana Airways, primarily a regional airline 
with a few long-haul routes to Europe, has the potential to emerge 
as a competitive air carrier with the help of some capital investment, 
Branson said. ``Virgin group of companies has the confidence to invest 
in Ghana,'' Branson said. ``I have come to begin a process that will 
lead to the establishment of a framework for business collaboration.'' 
Branson's interest in Ghana Airways may have been triggered by the 
possibility of a void in regional airline services. West and central 
Africa's primary carrier, Air Afrique, is facing dramatic debt problems 
and is running out of time to find a solution. The troubled Air Afrique 
has until the end of the month to come up with money to pay off its 
creditors. In addition to the airline industry, Branson is looking 
at possible investment deals in Ghana's railway services and the music 
and hotel industries. ``Ghana is a viable place to do business,'' 
Branson said. ``The success of Ghana's economic and political development 
would send the right signals to other African countries.'' In addition 
to his airline, Branson's diversified business empire includes music 
publishing and other entertainment ventures, including a soft drink 
line.
