For The World, this is Alan Dow in the BBC newsroom in London. State-run 
television in Baghdad says Saddam Hussein's deputy, Izzat Ibrahim, 
has escaped unharmed after an assassination attempt. Reports say two 
grenades were thrown at Mr. Ibrahim's car on a visit to a holy city 
on Sunday. Earlier, Iraqi opposition groups meeting in London agreed 
to work more closely in an effort to topple Saddam. After talks with 
the dissidents, the British minister responsible for Middle East affairs, 
Derek Fatchett, said London was in favor of trying Saddam on charges 
of genocide. It's fairly obvious that crimes against humanity have 
been committed by this leadership. The evidence is clear. I think 
the campaign is also a strong one, and it's one that the international 
community, I'm sure, would find extremely attractive.British foreign 
minister Derek Fatchett.
