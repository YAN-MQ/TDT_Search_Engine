"CNN Headline News." I'm Lynne Russell. Thanks for joining us this 
evening. Susan McDougal says independent counsel Ken Starr had "better 
be scared of me because I'm on my way back." In a California courtroom 
today, the Whitewater figure mouthed the words "Thank you" to jurors 
after they found her not guilty on all nine counts of embezzlement 
and tax evasion. McDougal was charged with stealing money from conductor 
zubin mehta and his wife while she was their bookkeeper. And she was 
accused of not filing a state income tax return. McDougal is a former 
business partner of President Clinton's. She has served nearly two 
years in prison in connection with the Whitewater investigation, which 
she claims is politically motivated. I know that they wanted to exert 
pressure. They have done it for -- the last years of my life has been 
about Bill clinton. Everything that's happened to me has been so that 
I would tell some story that was not the truth about Bill or Hillary 
Clinton. And it starts again in February of this next year. I go again 
before a trial on this very thing and I think that's what this trial 
was about. McDougal's next trial is in Arkansas on charges of contempt 
and obstruction of justice for refusing to testify before the independent 
counsel's grand jury about President Clinton.
