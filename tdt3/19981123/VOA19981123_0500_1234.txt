The top men's doubles team of Yanko Eltin and Paul Arhaus of the Netherlands 
ended their successful partnership with a victory for season-ending 
ATP World Doubles Championships in Hartford, Connecticut. Eltin and 
Arhaus teamed for a 6-4, 6-2, 7-5 win Sunday over Mark Knolls of the 
Bahamas and Daniel Nestor of Canada. The Dutch duo went undefeated 
in five matches during the week to claim their second world title. 
Eltin says the pair was successful because of good teamwork and communication. 
Well, obviously we play a lot together, so you know exactly what's 
going to happen. If Paul gets a certain shot, I know most likely where 
he's going to play it which means I can position myself much better 
at the net or on the baseline. I think that's the most important thing, 
and especially the communication. Obviously, we can talk in Dutch, 
you know, and then we can change some things at the last minute. The 
opponents never understand it anyway. Eltin was among the top 20 singles 
players in the world until a knee injury forced him to concentrate 
on doubles for nearly 2 years. He is now retired.
