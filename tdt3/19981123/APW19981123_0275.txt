Baseball's most storied team is on the auction block. Owner George 
Steinbrenner is talking with Cablevision Systems Corp. about selling 
a major share of the New York Yankees. He would retain control of 
the World Series champions in any deal, a source familiar with the 
negotiations said Sunday night on the condition of anonymity. A sale 
would involve only Steinbrenner's limited partner shares. He would 
retain his shares as managing general partner, and thus keep control 
of team operations. He owns 59 percent of the Yankees. NBC Sports 
reported a deal was agreed to last week and said it called for Steinbrenner 
to turn over full ownership of the team to Cablevision for dlrs 600 
million. The Daily News Monday said the deal it called for Cablevision 
to buy 70 percent of the team for dlrs 525 million. Steinbrenner denied 
that any deal had been struck, but said in Monday's New York Times: 
``If it is done, the Steinbrenners will be in control.'' Cablevision 
president James Dolan declined to comment. A deal that values that 
Yankees at dlrs 550 million to dlrs 600 million would make it the 
most expensive North American sports franchise and the second-most 
expensive in the world. Rupert Murdoch is negotiating to take over 
the English soccer team Manchester United for about dlrs 1 billion. 
Steinbrenner, 68, led a group that paid dlrs 10 million to purchase 
the Yankees from CBS in 1973. He has seen the value of the team increase, 
particularly with its 23rd and 24th World Series championships in 
the last three years and a record 125 victories last season. Cablevision 
also controls the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks 
and the National Hockey League's New York Rangers. Steinbrenner wouldn't 
address rumors that Dolan would give him operating control of those 
franchises, too.
