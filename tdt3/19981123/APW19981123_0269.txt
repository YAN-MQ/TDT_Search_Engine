A Cathay Pacific Airways jet carrying 232 passengers made an emergency 
dive of 23,000 feet (6,970 meters) after losing cabin pressure during 
a flight from New Zealand to Hong Kong, the airline said Monday. Flight 
CX108 from Auckland was diverted Saturday to Sydney, Australia, after 
about three hours in the air. The passengers _ all of them unhurt 
_ made it to Hong Kong a day late aboard another flight, Cathay Pacific 
spokeswoman Katherine Wang said. The Airbus A-340-300 jet was cruising 
at 33,000 feet (10,000 meters) when the cabin pressure plunged, so 
the captain dived to bring the airplane to a safe level of around 
10,000 feet (3,000 meters) within two to three minutes, Wang said. 
Cathay Pacific took issue with a report in the South China Morning 
Post that the plane also had lost oxygen. The newspaper quoted passenger 
Tony Allen as saying that air masks had dropped in the cabin but ``most 
of them had no oxygen.'' Cathay Pacific said the masks were working, 
but many passengers apparently had expected they would inflate on 
their own. The masks have to be pulled by passengers before oxygen 
starts flowing, as flight crews announce at the start of journeys 
on virtually all airlines, Wang said. ``Sometimes people fly on an 
airplane and they never bother to watch the safety videos,'' Wang 
said. ``I don't know if the oxygen masks were needed but the captain 
deployed them just the same.'' The problem was caused by the failure 
of an air valve in the pressurization system, Wang said.
