As the clock wound down on Stanford's 76-51 victory over Southwest 
Missouri State on Friday night, the rambunctious student section at 
Maples Pavilion decided to give its team a proper send-off to one 
of basketball's biggest stages. It began chanting, ``New York City! 
New York City!'' The victory assured the third-ranked Cardinal (3-0) 
a spot in Wednesday's semifinals of the preseason National Invitation 
Tournament at Madison Square Garden. Stanford will be returning to 
the Garden for the first time in seven years _ its third appearance 
there over all _ to face St. John's. The last time Stanford played 
in the Garden, it captured the 1991 post-season NIT, defeating Oklahoma 
by 78-72. In 1936, the all-American Hank Luisetti led Stanford to 
a 45-31 victory at the Garden over Long Island University. These are 
heady times for Stanford, whose basketball success has usually been 
achieved by the women's program. Stanford has graced the covers of 
several preseason publications as the No. 1 team in the country, including 
Sports Illustrated. Eleven letter-winners, including all five starters, 
return from a team that last season raced to an 18-0 start and made 
its first Final Four appearance since 1942 before succumbing to the 
eventual national champion, Kentucky, by 86-85 in overtime. ``We're 
not used to that here,'' said the junior forward Mark Madsen, referring 
to the expectations. ``All the rankings has been a surprise to a lot 
of us. Is there pressure? Yeah, there's a little bit of pressure. 
But we have to always remind ourselves that we're here to have fun. 
Let's enjoy the journey and let's not get caught up in the pressure.'' 
For Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery, it is a pinnacle that he has been 
building toward since he took over for Tom Davis in 1986. Before departing 
after four mediocre seasons, Davis summed up his coaching experience 
at Stanford by saying it was impossible to win here. Twelve years 
later, Stanford finds itself not only winning, but also expecting 
to win. In an era where many star players turn pro early, Stanford 
has built a program whose players stay all four years and graduate 
on time. But it is not a recent phenomenon at Stanford. In the last 
nine years, Todd Lichti, Adam Keefe and Brevin Knight have all gone 
in the first round of the National Basketball Association draft after 
playing four years at Stanford. ``In Brevin's case, I think he needed 
that extra year to prove himself,'' the senior center Tim Young, a 
teammate of Knight's for three seasons, said. ``But a lot of it is 
liking the experience you have here that makes you want to stay.'' 
The seniors Kris Weems, Arthur Lee, Peter Sauer, Mark Seaton and Young 
have a bond that has developed as the program rose from a near-upset 
of Marcus Camby and No. 1 Massachusetts in the second round of the 
N.C.A.A. tournament their freshman year to a first Sweet Sixteen appearance 
the following year to last season's Final Four run. ``Coach Montgomery 
wants guys to stick around,'' Madsen said. ``He likes his players. 
He works us very hard, but he treats us fairly. He's into improvement. 
He's into building a strong basketball program, and that comes with 
having seniors. ``I think the guys on the team like being here at 
Stanford. I think they like going to class, and they want to get their 
degrees. So from that standpoint, there's a certain incentive to stick 
around.''
