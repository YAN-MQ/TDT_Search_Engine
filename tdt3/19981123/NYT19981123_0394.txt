Tyco International said Monday that it had agreed to buy AMP Inc. 
for $11.3 billion, or $51 a share, topping a $9.7 billion hostile 
takeover offer by Allied Signal for the company. The offer from Tyco, 
the largest provider of security systems and best known for its ADT 
alarms, was widely expected to end Allied Signal's almost four-month-old 
$44.50 a share battle for AMP, a leading maker of electrical connectors. 
Although some analysts were predicting that Allied, also AMP's largest 
shareholder, might try to block the deal, Allied said Monday that 
if the deal was successful, it would sell its 20 million shares, or 
9 percent holding, as well. ``The price being paid by Tyco clearly 
exceeds the value we place on AMP,'' said Lawrence A. Bossidy, Allied's 
chief executive. ``We believe our gain on the AMP shares we own will 
substantially exceed our costs incurred in pursuing AMP.'' However, 
if the Tyco deal is unsuccessful, Allied would still be interested 
in buying AMP, a spokesman said. The merger would create a company 
with a total market capitalization of approximately $54 billion, total 
annual revenues of more than $22 billion, and operations in more than 
80 countries. AMP's revenues, about $5.5 billion in 1997, would account 
for about 25 percent of the revenues of the combined company. L. Dennis 
Kozlowski, Tyco's chairman and chief executive, said his company considered 
buying AMP after Tyco was approached by AMP executives who were interested 
in a sale of the company. Almost since the Allied deal was announced, 
AMP's board of directors and Robert Ripp, the chief executive, have 
been opposed to the deal. Until recently, after rumors began arising 
that AMP was seeking a friendly offer to thwart Allied, and Ripp made 
statements indicating that AMP would consider other purchase offers, 
many believed that AMP executives were trying to keep the company 
independent. Ripp will remain as president of AMP and gain a seat 
on Tyco's board. Most members of AMP's senior management will keep 
their jobs. Kozlowski said the acquisition would add 12 cents a share 
to Tyco's earnings in the current fiscal year, which started Oct. 
1, 35 cents a share in the 2000 fiscal year and up to 50 cents a share 
in the 2001 fiscal year. Cost savings of about $210 million are forecast 
during the first six months, with an additional $550 million expected 
in two years, he said. In addition, largely through cost savings, 
Tyco expects to increase AMP's operating margin from about 9 percent 
to about 20 percent a year within two years. But several analysts 
questioned whether the cost cuts and increased profitability forecast 
by Tyco and AMP were realistic. Some also wondered why Tyco had decided 
to make a bid for AMP. The main business of the Harrisburg, Pa., company 
is considered cyclical and had experienced slowing growth. ``This 
is a show-me company,'' said William Milton, an analyst at Brown Brothers 
Harriman. ``There has been no sustained earnings growth at this company 
in over 10 years.'' Michael Donnelly, a vice president and senior 
portfolio manager at Federated Investors, which owns about two million 
AMP shares, said aside from Ripp, who took command at AMP in late 
summer, ``one thing that is disturbing is that they're sticking with 
the same management team that has been failing for six years.'' Based 
on Tyco's closing price last Friday of $65.0625 a share, each AMP 
shareholder would receive 0.7839 share of Tyco stock for each share 
of AMP. Under the terms, AMP shareholders could receive as much as 
$55.95 a share. But if Tyco's share price falls below $60, either 
AMP or Tyco could terminate the deal. AMP is prohibited from entering 
into another merger agreement before Nov. 6, 1999. Monday, AMP shares 
rose $3, to $48.125, a 52-week high. Tyco shares rose 43.75 cents, 
to $65.50. Allied Signal shares rose $1, to $42.8125. In the last 
year and a half, Tyco had agreed to spend more than $13.4 billion 
to expand its four main businesses: security systems, medical products, 
valves and electronics. The AMP acquisition would be Tyco's largest. 
Also Monday, Tyco announced plans to buy Sunbelt Plastics for about 
$85 million in cash. The Monroe, La., company manufactures film products. 
The Tyco-AMP deal would be accounted for as a tax-free pooling of 
interests, meaning that the balance sheets of Tyco and AMP would be 
combined. If the purchase had been a cash deal, the difference between 
the price paid for AMP and the market value of its assets would be 
recorded as good will, which would have to be written off over a period 
of years.
