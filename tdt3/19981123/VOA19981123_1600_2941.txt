It's Universal time, and here is the major story we're following this 
hour. Iraq has delivered another letter to the United Nations Security 
Council explaining why it has not handed over documents requested 
by Chief U.N. Arms Inspector Richard Butler. We'll have an update 
on that story in 11 minutes at 22 hours Universal time. Time now for 
a business update, and with a look at Wall Street and other business 
news, here is Breck Artery.
