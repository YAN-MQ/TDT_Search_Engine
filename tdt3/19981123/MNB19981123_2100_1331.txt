It was a wild day on Wall Street, where mergers and acquisitions dominated. 
The possibility that Netscape will be taken over by America online. 
Add to that a $10 billion deal in the brokerage industry, and it was 
off to the races, the Dow closing at its highest level since July 
17. A phenomenal performance, wiping out the losses from the early 
summer. The Internet stocks were a feature of today's activity, with 
Amazon.com, ebay, and others, were at an all-time high. Add to that 
the likelihood that the Dow could reach 10000 sometime soon, and it 
was a red-letter day.
