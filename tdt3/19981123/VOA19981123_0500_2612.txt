The murder rate in the United States has reached its lowest level 
in 30 years as serious crimes reported to police declined for the 
sixth consecutive year. The FBI reported 1997 U.S. crime figures on 
Sunday which showed a 7 percent drop in murders from the previous 
year. FBI figures also showed a 2 percent decline in reported serious 
crimes. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno says that the decreases in 
crime are real and go beyond statistics, but she says the war on crime 
is still on-going.
