Iraq and Chief U.N. Arms Inspector Richard Butler will take their 
argument over missing documents to the U.N. Security Council today. 
Iraq's U.N. Envoy Nizar Homdum says Mr. Butler is demanding documents 
that do not exist so he can justify a U.S. military strike against 
Iraq for not cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors.
