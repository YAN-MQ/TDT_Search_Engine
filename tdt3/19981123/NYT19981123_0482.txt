In another demonstration of the blurring of the lines between online 
and off-line advertising and media realms, a leading Internet marketer 
is naming the world's ninth-largest agency to handle duties ranging 
from global brand-building to creating campaigns for television, magazines 
and newspapers. Autobytel.com Inc., which operates a popular online 
car-buying service, will announce Tuesday the hiring of Grey Advertising 
in New York as its agency for those traditional tasks, which will 
supplement the marketing efforts the company makes in cyberspace through 
the Grey interactive division. Autobytel.com, which is based in Irvine, 
Calif., plans to increase total spending considerably next year from 
the $20 million that was budgeted for 1998. Grey, with billings of 
more than $7.6 billion, works for such giant blue-chip marketers as 
Conagra Inc., Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. and SmithKline Beecham. The 
decision by Autobytel.com to join their ranks is indicative of the 
growing presence of Internet advertisers in conventional media as 
they seek to appeal to cyberspace newbies _ or even to those consumers 
who think ``online'' refers to a telephone call or a fish. ``The large 
traditional marketers built their brands with large traditional agencies,'' 
said Anne Benvenuto, senior vice president for marketing at Autobytel.com. 
``To help us become a household name like P&AMP;G, we wanted an agency 
known for building brands globally with expertise beyond the Internet.'' 
``We knew it was time to build more of an emotional bond with consumers,'' 
she added, ``and you do that through traditional media.'' Ms. Benvenuto 
discussed the decision to hire Grey in an interview Monday in midtown 
Manhattan. She was joined by executives of Grey and RBI Communications 
Inc., an advertising and public relations agency in Hollywood that 
created Autobytel.com spots for the 1997 and 1998 Super Bowls. RBI 
will continue handling corporate communications for Autobytel.com. 
The increased attention and business generated by those Super Bowl 
spots underscored for Autobytel.com ``the power of traditional media 
like television,'' Ms. Benvenuto said, and ``the need to take the 
traditional side more seriously.'' ``A balance between driving the 
sale and driving the brand is what we're looking for,'' she added. 
Among the interactive marketers that have also recently hired traditional 
agencies to produce advertising off line are Snap, a search engine 
controlled by the NBC unit of General Electric Co., which selected 
the San Francisco office of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, part of Saatchi 
&AMP; Saatchi PLC, and ZDTV, a cable network operated by the Ziff-Davis 
unit of Softbank Corp., which chose the San Francisco office of Foote, 
Cone &AMP; Belding, owned by True North Communications. As cybermarketers 
look beyond agencies specializing in online advertising, mainstream 
shops are beefing up their interactive abilities. Wickersham Hunt 
Schwantner in Boston, for instance, which is owned by Snyder Communications, 
has agreed to acquire Berenson Isham &AMP; Partners, a Boston agency 
with billings estimated at $40 million that manages interactive assignments 
for such advertisers as Club Med, The Financial Times and Fidelity 
Investments. That deal was for cash and stock valued at $3 million. 
The hiring of Grey Advertising by Autobytel.com comes seven months 
after the company named the agency's online unit, Grey Interactive, 
to handle a variety of marketing communications assignments that included 
brand advertising and campaigns to run in traditional media. But ``we 
needed to take things to the next level,'' Ms. Benvenuto said, ``because 
I don't think you can build a brand with the Internet alone.'' ``If 
we want to seed the likely prospects who will be online next year, 
we have to start developing preferences for our brand off line,'' 
she said. Michael Rasmussen, the vice president at Grey Advertising 
who is group management supervisor on the Autobytel.com account, said 
the agency would ``operate as an integrated resource with all our 
disciplines working together,'' particularly as Autobytel.com expands 
internationally. Web sites are in the works for the first quarter 
of 1999 for Britain and the Nordic countries, to join the site operating 
for the United States and Canada (www.autobytel.com). The media services 
for the creative work produced by Grey Advertising and Grey Interactive, 
Rasmussen said, will be handled by Grey's Mediacom Worldwide (off 
line) and Media.com (online). A mainstream campaign from Grey Advertising 
is due early next year. If executives at Autobytel.com are, as Ms. 
Benvenuto put it, ``maverick marketers,'' the choice of Grey Advertising 
is at odds with the old perceptions that the agency's creative output 
was as colorless as its name. ``Creative is very important,'' Ms. 
Benvenuto said, ``and Grey has strong creative. But there's also a 
lot to be said for strategy and strong account management.''
