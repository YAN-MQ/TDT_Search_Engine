Dan Cloutier, who has started the New York Rangers' last two games, 
is again scheduled to start against the Sabres in Buffalo on Wednesday. 
But coach John Muckler insisted Tuesday that Mike Richter remained 
his No. 1 goalie. Cloutier is unbeaten in his last four starts and 
was superb last week in a victory in Los Angeles and a tie in San 
Jose, allowing just three goals on 69 shots. Since losing to the Devils 
on Oct. 16, Cloutier is 2-0-2. ``Cloutier has played well the last 
two games, so we figured we'd go with him,'' Muckler said of his decision 
to start Cloutier in Buffalo and Richter on Thursday in Pittsburgh. 
``Cloutier is the hot goalie at this time.'' Muckler added: ``Richter 
is the No. 1 goalkeeper. And he will see the majority of the games. 
They know what their roles are. I have no problem about playing either 
one of them.'' ``It's always nice to play some back to back games,'' 
Cloutier said after Monday's practice. ``They want to bring me along 
slow. I still got to learn a lot of things in this league. I know 
I'm not going to get in 50 games.'' Richter, who has gone five games 
without a victory, said he understood Muckler's decision to go with 
Cloutier. ``It's good to know that when I'm not playing well or when 
I need a rest, there's a guy right there who can step right in,'' 
Richter said. This season, Richter is 3-7-4 with a 2.73 goals against 
average. During the five-game streak without a victory, Richter is 
0-4-1 with a 3.31 goals against average. The Rangers could be without 
several key players when they face the Sabres. The team's biggest 
defensemen, Jeff Beukeboom (concussion) and Ulf Samuelsson (strained 
groin), did not practice Monday. Beukeboom will not play against the 
Sabres and Samuelsson is questionable, though Samuelsson's reputation 
for playing in pain would suggest he might try to play. Also missing 
practice because of injuries were Aleksei Kovalev (shoulder) and Todd 
Harvey (elbow).
