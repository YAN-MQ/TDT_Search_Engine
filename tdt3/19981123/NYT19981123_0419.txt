The nationally televised death of a Michigan man at the hands of Dr. 
Jack Kevorkian appeared to be illegal, the prosecuting attorney in 
Pontiac, Mich., said Monday, but a decision on whether to prosecute 
Kevorkian could not rest on televised excerpts of the videotapes. 
The excerpts of the videotapes were shown Sunday night on the CBS 
News show ``60 Minutes'' and helped boost the show's ratings on the 
important last weekend of the November ``sweeps,'' when audiences 
are measured to set advertising rates. ``After viewing the edited 
portions of the video last night, it appeared a homicide was committed 
in violation of the laws of the state of Michigan,'' said David Gorcyca, 
the prosecuting attorney for Oakland County. ``However, a charging 
decision will not be made until the videotapes are viewed in their 
entirety.'' Kevorkian wants to be charged with murder or a lesser 
crime for his involvement in the death by lethal injection of Thomas 
Youk, said David Gorosh, Kevorkian's lawyer. Kevorkian, a retired 
pathologist whose license to practice medicine has been revoked in 
Michigan and California, did not return telephone calls, but told 
his lawyer he would give the prosecutor one week to file charges against 
him. Gorosh said Kevorkian told him that if he is not charged, he 
would consider Oakland County a ``euthanasia-free zone,'' and then 
would continue helping others to die. Kevorkian has said he wants 
to be charged and acquitted, or, if convicted, to die by a hunger 
strike in prison. Youk, a 52-year-old accountant and race-car enthusiast 
who was suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, died on Sept. 17 at home 
in Waterford, Mich., with only Kevorkian present. Youk's wife, Melody, 
said on ``60 Minutes'' that she did not consider his death to be murder. 
The case is apparently the first in which Kevorkian has administered 
the lethal drugs himself. In other cases he has been present during 
self-induced deaths in which his ``suicide machine'' was used. The 
death scene shown on ``60 Minutes'' was videotaped by Kevorkian. The 
preliminary estimate for the much-publicized broadcast showed a rating 
of 15.7, up 23 percent from the show's average 12.8 for the fall season, 
a ``60 Minutes'' spokesman said. The share of households watching 
the program was 25, up 19 percent from the average of 21. Each rating 
point represents 994,000 homes, so approximately 15.6 million households 
watched the show on Sunday. The rating was the highest for the show 
this season. The next-highest rating this season was a 15.2, for a 
broadcast on Nov. 8. The spokesman for ``60 Minutes'' said it would 
be wrong to attribute all of the increase in audience share to the 
Kevorkian segment. Ratings generally rise as the days grow shorter 
and the weather cools, because more people are indoors and watching 
television. Kevorkian could be charged under Michigan's new law against 
assisted suicide, or could face a charge of murder or manslaughter. 
The prosecutor would not tip his hand, but said at a news conference, 
``Consent is not a defense to homicide in the state of Michigan.'' 
The doctor has been tried four times on lesser charges; three trials 
ended in acquittals and one was declared a mistrial. Prosecutors have 
tried in the past to charge him with murder but judges have dismissed 
those charges. Now, however, the judicial system is confronted by 
a doctor who acknowledged giving the lethal injection himself. The 
key evidence this time is expected to be the videotapes. The prosecutor 
said he had subpoenaed them from CBS News, which said it has not decided 
whether to resist the subpoena. Kevorkian said Monday through his 
lawyer that he would turn the tapes over himself. But his lawyer, 
Gorosh, said he advised the doctor against doing so. Whether Kevorkian 
would turn over the tapes is unknown, Gorosh said. ``He's a hard man 
to predict,'' said Gorosh. He added that Kevorkian had not consulted 
him before giving the tapes to CBS. Gorosh noted that he is trying 
to keep out of prison a man who wants to be charged with causing a 
death, and who has said he intends to represent himself at trial. 
The prosecutor expressed skepticism on Monday about Kevorkian's motives 
in supplying the tape to ``60 Minutes.'' ``What was most disturbing 
about the segment that aired last night,'' Gorcyca said, ``was the 
total lack of compassion exhibited for Mr. Youk in the last few moments 
of his life.'' In the tape, Kevorkian is heard obtaining Youk's permission 
to administer the lethal drugs. Viewers saw Kevorkian give Youk three 
injections. Watching the scene on videotape while being interviewed 
by ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Mike Wallace, Kevorkian said flatly, 
``He's dying now.'' ``I saw a nonchalant, callous, businesslike approach 
involving the death of a person for the purpose of satisfying an attention-starved 
ego,'' Gorcyca said. ``It would have been more appropriate to submit 
the tapes to local law-enforcement agencies than a national TV show, 
if Kevorkian wanted to legitimately challenge the statute in a court 
of law. If Kevorkian is serious about challenging the validity of 
the assisted-suicide statute or any other charges that may be filed, 
he will fully cooperate with the investigation.'' Kevorkian's lawyer 
conceded that the scene appeared cold, because only Kevorkian was 
present at the death, but said the Youk family could not be present 
because they feared prosecution. If euthanasia or assisted suicide 
is made legal, Gorosh said, the terminally ill could die at home with 
their families. ``The issue comes down to whether the citizens of 
this community feel what he did is a crime,'' Gorosh said. ``There 
is no criminal intent here. There is no malice. How could mercy be 
considered murder?''
