In a moment, Iraq and the United Nations, who is provoking whom? You 
know, the last I looked, the average workday lasts more than a few 
hours, right? Right. But average pain relievers may work for a few 
hours then quit. Good thing there's aleve. aleve has the strength... 
to work on arthritis pain all day long with just two pills. It would 
take eight Tylenol to do that. So, if your pain reliever isn't putting 
in a full day's work-- fire it. Fire it. And take aleve. Two pills, 
all day relief. Works for me.
