Admitting for the first time this season that he would be ``pretty 
hard pressed to find somebody who didn't play well,'' Coach Bill Parcells 
turned his attention Monday to the Jets' final five games. ``I thought 
we had to win four out of six, and now we have to win three out of 
five,'' he said. With an impressive 24-3 decision over Tennessee on 
Sunday, the Jets, in fact, have won five of their last six games. 
The Jets have a record of 7-4, and Parcells believes that it will 
take 10 victories to reach the playoffs. The stretch run includes 
home games against the Carolina Panthers and Seattle Seahawks, followed 
by back-to-back road games at Miami and Buffalo and the season finale 
against the New England Patriots at the Meadowlands. Indeed, winning 
four of five seems quite possible. Carolina is 2-9 and Seattle is 
5-6, and the Jets have beaten Buffalo, Miami and New England this 
season. ``We've got three at home,'' he said. ``I don't say we're 
in great position, but we're in position.'' And why not? Despite the 
up-and-down aspects of the season, the overall effect has been upbeat. 
Parcells likes to complain that his team does not yet understand winning. 
Certainly, Jets fans have an anguished history of holding their breath 
_ 30 years without a division title. Still, statistically, the Jets 
have become a leading team in the National Football League: only four 
offenses generate more yards a game, and only three defenses permit 
fewer. Against the Oilers, the Jets did so many of the positive things 
that have turned the franchise around. The players show no signs of 
forgetting how to accomplish them. --Stopping the run: Eddie George 
was held to 94 yards on 24 carries. No surprise there. Only two runners 
have gained 100 yards against the Jets this year. In the season opener, 
Garrison Hearst passed that figure, but it took his overtime 96-yard 
winning dash. Since then, only the Patriots' Robert Edwards hit the 
figure _ in a losing effort. --Generating the run: With his 123-yard 
performance, Curtis Martin has hit the 100-yard mark six times _ with 
the Jets winning five of those games. --Preventing touchdowns: The 
Oilers became the fourth team this season to fail to produce a touchdown 
against the Jets. The Jets have yielded the third-fewest points a 
game in the league: 16.1. At this rate, they would also become the 
second-stingiest defense in Jets history. (The 1993 team allowed 15.44 
points a game.) --The Mo Lewis factor: The linebacker's one-armed 
grab of George, after a 1-yard screen pass on a third-and-3, halted 
a drive on Sunday. It forced the Oilers to punt in the final period 
while trailing by 17-3. The Jets quickly scored to put the game out 
of reach. Over all, Lewis had 10 tackles in one of his most active 
games of the season. --Third-down success: It was 50 percent against 
the befuddled Oilers. The Jets have surpassed the Broncos as the American 
Football Conference's top team on third downs with a 44.4 percent 
success rate. That is also fourth-best in the league. --Quarterbacking: 
The Jets do it well; the opponents don't. Steve McNair was held to 
fewer than 6 yards an attempt. Opposing quarterbacks complete only 
53.1 percent of their passes, have tossed 16 interceptions to only 
10 touchdowns and average a meager 5.89 yards an attempt. Vinny Testaverde, 
meanwhile, is completing almost 60 percent of his attempts, which 
average 7.71 yards. And his 18 touchdowns to only 4 interceptions 
is one of the most imposing quarterback statistics of the year, if 
not league history. Was Parcells planning to watch Monday night's 
matchup between the Dolphins and the Patriots? A Dolphin loss would 
put the Jets in a three-way tie with the Bills. ``I don't care,'' 
Parcells said when asked which team he wanted to win. ``It doesn't 
make any difference to me.''
