A Swiss woman is muscling her way to the top of the competitive sport 
of arm wrestling. We have more from "CNN world report" contributor 
Swiss radio and television. This is one young woman nobody is going 
to mess with. Her hobby is arm wrestling. Ready, go. She's very good 
at it. Ready, go. Christine feller is a professional fitness instructer. 
She works out daily with her boyfriend, a top-notch arm wrestler. 
Ready, go. Training sessions are inevitably tough. Then it's time 
to call it a day, not forgetting a bit of friendly praise. They've 
both won several national championships as well as many other titles 
and trophies. Christine's enthusiasm for the sport goes back to her 
childhood. I used to arm wrestle in school just for fun. But always 
against boys. Since I soon found out that the girls weren't strong 
enough. Food is an important factor. Apart from protein concentrates, 
Christine and Thomas follow a strict diet that avoids salt, fat, and 
sweets. But what about things like anabolic steroids? No, never, never. 
The arm wrestling season is peppered with events such as these regional 
championships. Christine has reached the semifinal round. Although 
she wins the bout, she's obviously not in top shape. But only Thomas 
knows is that she entered the tournament nursing a severely sore wrist. 
Before the final round, she resorts to a decidedly uncvik tisk method 
of reducing the swelling. I had to give it all hi and forget my wrist. 
Afterwards, the pain was worse than ever. So today, there's no happy 
end for Christine. Although she puts up a good fight, she loses the 
final. A hug from the winner, no hard feelings. And second place is 
not the end of the world. Ron green for CNN world report.
