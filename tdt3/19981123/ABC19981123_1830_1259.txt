In the wide open spaces of the western United States, there is what 
the U.S. attorney general's office has called a public safety crisis. 
There are simply not enough police officers to go around on the vast 
skpanss of Indian res vags land. The murder rate on some reservations 
are twice that of some places. Navajo police go on night patrol in 
Arizona, they think about officer hoskie Gene, the 35-year-old father 
of five was investigating a Burglary one cold night when he was jumped 
by two men. He radioed for help, but time it arrived, officer Gene 
was dead. They overpowered him and beat him to death essentially. 
His backup was a good 60 miles away. On the vast Indian reservations 
of the west, violent crime is exploding. Murders have risen 87%. Yet, 
Indian police, who are funded by the federal bureau of Indian affairs, 
are so underfunded they have only a third as many officers as most 
other communities. The budget, the funding has never been adequate. 
I don't think anyone can argue with that. a single patrolman may cover 
3,000 square miles, going endlessly from call to call. you. Have to 
make it short and quick and get back on the road to respond to another 
one. You're constantly moving about. That was what captain Jack Spencer 
was doing, when at the end of a 30-hour shift he fell asleep at the 
wheel, crashed and died. Indian police departments often lack even 
the basics, decent vehicles, working radios, bullet-proof vests. Many 
reservations do not have 11 service or even spare tires for their 
squad cars. The navajos finally gave up on the police substation letting 
the gangs take over. They hope to reclaim it some day. But for now, 
they are outmanned, outgunned, out of luck. Tom foreman, ABC News.
