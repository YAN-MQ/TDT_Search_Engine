Indonesian rescue workers in Jakarta have pulled at least seven more 
charred bodies from the rubble of a Christian gambling hall attacked 
by Moslem rioters. The discovery brings the death toll from Sunday's 
violence to 13. Religious tensions exploded when as many as 2,000 
Moslems took to the streets calling for a holy war against the Christian 
community.
