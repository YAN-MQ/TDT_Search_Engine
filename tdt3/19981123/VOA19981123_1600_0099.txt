A top British official has met with 16 Iraqi opposition groups to 
see how Britain can help them coordinate their efforts to oust Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein. Correspondent Laurie Kasman reports the meeting 
aimed at a show of unity among the often-competing Iraqi Kurdish, 
Shiite and Sunni factions. Britain's Secretary of State for Middle 
East Affairs, Garrett Fatchett, has asked the 16 groups to propose 
a common plan of action to see how Britain can help. Iraqi dissident 
Hamid el Byati, who attended the meeting, says there is a new sense 
of urgency after Saddam Hussein's latest confrontation with the United 
Nations. Mr. Fatchett emphasized that we are in a new stage and events 
are developing quickly, and we have to work together quickly to see 
a new Iraq, a new government in Iraq shortly, and we hope that will 
be soon rather than late. The exiled dissidents will also meet U.S. 
officials in London on Tuesday. Laurie Kasman, VOA News, London.
