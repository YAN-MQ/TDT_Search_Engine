Germany's Social Democratic Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine used 
his European Union debut Monday to seek support for a left-leaning 
agenda to shift the economic focus from fighting inflation to creating 
jobs. Lafontaine and his fellow socialists, who now run the governments 
of all but four of the 15 EU nations, dismissed fears their quest 
for economic expansion would mean a return to sloppy finances. ``We 
don't want to fall into a situation, as we had several years ago, 
with lax budget policies and restrictive monetary policies,'' French 
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn told reporters. Ahead of Monday's 
EU finance minister's meeting, the socialists ministers stressed their 
commitment to the EU's ``stability pact'' which threatens fines against 
nations that run up big deficits after they adopt the euro as a shared 
currency on Jan. 1. ``The stability pact ... is vital given the importance 
of budgetary discipline ... most European countries must be tougher 
on their current budget deficits,'' the socialists said in a joint-policy 
document entitled ``The New European Way.'' Ministers from the 11 
nations in the first group to adopt the euro met with Wim Duisenberg, 
head of the European Central Bank, which will set interest rates for 
the currency bloc. Some urged him to keep rates low to help boost 
job-creation since since inflation is at its lowest levels in decades, 
just 1 percent in the euro-zone. In contrast, unemployment in the 
11 nations is stubbornly high at 10.9 percent. ``Nobody disputes monetary 
policy must also support economic growth and employment, if price 
stability isn't endangered,'' Lafontaine said. ``We all agree that 
price stability exists.'' However, Lafontaine insisted he was not 
seeking to undermine the bank's independence from government interference. 
Duisenberg told reporters he felt ``no pressure whatsoever to cut 
rates.'' Despite the plans for intensified cooperation, ministers 
were confronted with serious policy differences. Britain's Chancellor 
of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, another socialist, warned he'd veto 
French and German proposals for EU-wide taxes aimed at discouraging 
companies from crossing borders in search of lower taxes. ``Tax harmonization 
is no way forward for Europe,'' Brown said. In a dispute over who 
represents the euro-zone internationally, Germany, France and Italy 
irritated smaller nations by refusing to cede their seats at the G-7 
group of world economic powers to a joint euro-bloc representative. 
``It's a chance for Europe to speak with one voice (but) there is 
a rift between those that have a seat at the G-7 and the others,'' 
said EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy. There were hints 
of a compromise as France backed a proposal for a rotating system 
that would allow a minister from one of the smaller nations to sit 
at G-7 finance meetings alongside the EU's existing G-7 members and 
the European Central Bank. Differences also persisted over efforts 
to overhaul the EU's budget so the Union can afford to bring in up 
to 12 new members over the next decade, mostly from former-communist 
eastern Europe. Britain, Germany and others are pushing for a freeze 
that would keep spending at current levels until 2006. Less well-off 
EU members led by Spain fear such rigor will mean them losing out 
as funds start flowing to the even poorer easterners. ``I don't believe 
this is a positive or constructive way forward,'' said Rodrigo Rato, 
Spain's economics minister.
