The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 24: Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian is daring prosecutors to try him for euthanasia now that 
he has gone on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' with a tape showing him giving 
a lethal injection to a man suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease. They 
ought to oblige him. His actions are almost certainly illegal and 
can only disrupt the important debate over physician-assisted suicide. 
Kevorkian has apparently tired of merely assisting terminally ill 
patients by hooking them up to his ``suicide machine,'' by which they 
flip a switch to administer the fatal dose. He may believe there is 
no difference between providing the means of death and actually administering 
the dose. But serious advocates of physician-assisted suicide have 
been scrupulous in maintaining the distinction. The ethics of assisted 
suicide demand that patients, not doctors or anyone else, be in full 
control. Thus in Oregon, the only state that has legalized physician-assisted 
suicide, a doctor may write a prescription for lethal drugs, but may 
not administer them. An adult patient of sound mind can get such a 
prescription only if judged by two doctors to have less than six months 
to live. Lengthy regulations cover assisted-suicide procedures. A 
recent survey found that only eight terminal patients had taken lethal 
medications since November _ an indication the law is not being abused. 
Kevorkian operates under no such regulations in Michigan. He even 
opposed a Michigan ballot measure that would have legalized assisted 
suicide, on grounds that the regulations were too strict. But the 
public has been sympathetic to his crusade, and three juries have 
already acquitted him of charges relating to five deaths. The nation 
clearly needs more humane policies for easing the last days of the 
terminally ill. The rules must be drawn carefully, with strong safeguards 
for patients and room for aggressive pain relief. Kevorkian's ghoulish 
stunts can only hinder this process.
