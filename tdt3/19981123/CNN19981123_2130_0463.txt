The cost of smoking is going up. Tobacco companies brown and Williamson, 
R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris are raising the wholesale price of 
cigarettes by about 45 cents a pack. It's the largest cigarette price 
increase in the industry's history. The hike comes just a week after 
major tobacco companies reached a $206 billion settlement with 46 
states. Industry analysts had predicted the cost of the settlement 
would be passed along to smokers.
