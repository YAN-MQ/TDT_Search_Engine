The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 24: Iraq 
has gotten off to a shaky start in honoring its latest pledge to cooperate 
with U.N. arms inspections. By promising Washington that it would 
halt all interference with the inspectors' search for biological and 
chemical weapons and prohibited missiles, Baghdad won a last-minute 
reprieve from American air and missile attacks. Now, Saddam Hussein 
seems to be trimming back that commitment. Iraq is implausibly contending 
that it does not have any of the weapons documents the inspectors 
have asked to see and is suggesting that when full-scale inspections 
resume next month, the U.N. investigators may not be able to go everywhere 
they want. For now, more routine monitoring inspections have resumed. 
President Clinton is right to seek clarification of Iraqi intentions. 
But if Baghdad is back to its familiar game of thwarting the search 
for biological and chemical weapons and banned missiles, American 
military action may become unavoidable. The documents sought by the 
inspectors would show how much weapons material Iraq had before the 
Persian Gulf war. By subtracting what they have discovered and destroyed 
in seven years, inspectors can get a good fix on how much Baghdad 
has left. Iraq complicates the inspectors' work and delays completion 
of their efforts by insisting that no such documents exist. The U.N. 
must insist that these documents be handed over. The Security Council 
must also insist on unhindered access to all sites that Iraq promised 
to provide. Washington can quickly renew the threat of military force. 
Additional American troops and equipment are continuing to arrive 
in the Persian Gulf region. Inspections, if they can proceed freely, 
are still the most effective way to track down and eliminate Iraq's 
terror weapons. But if Iraq will not permit the inspectors to do their 
jobs, Washington will have no choice but to reduce Iraq's arsenal 
of deadly germs and chemicals by military force.
