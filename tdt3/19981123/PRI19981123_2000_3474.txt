Music to cook beans by from South Africa's a cappella kings Ladysmith 
Black Mambazo. Don't forget The World's online 24 hours a day at www.theworld.org. 
In Boston, I'm Lisa Mullins. Join us again tomorrow right here for 
another spin of The World. The World is a co-production of the BBC 
World Service, Public Radio International and WGBH Boston and is made 
possible in part by the PRI Program Fund, whose contributors include 
the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, 
the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the David and Lucille Packard 
Foundation.
