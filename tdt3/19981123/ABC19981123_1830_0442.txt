United Nations weapons inspector and the Iraqis, once again, it has 
to do with whether Iraq is telling the truth about its weapons programs. 
First, in Baghdad, ABC's Morton dean. The U.N. arms inspectors will 
not get all the documents demanded by their boss Richard Butler. Iraqi 
officials made that clear again this evening. All that we have, we 
gave. All that we don't have, we don't have. Iraq insists some of 
the documents requested by Butler never existed, some were destroyed 
or were handed over previously, while others were not relevant. Deputy 
prime minister Aziz, in a letter to the president of the security 
council today, suggested Butler is trying to "cast doubt on Iraq's 
cooperation," to provide a pretext for the U.S. and Britain to launch 
a Military attack. And to block a U.N.comprehensive review of the 
sanctions. Sharing the spotlight with the document controversy on 
the evening news here, was a report of the attempted assassination 
against one of Saddam hussein's closest advisers. Izzat Ibrahim is 
the vice president of Iraq's revolutionary command council. He was 
shown at a prayer meeting today as Iraqi TV reported he had escaped 
harm when hand grenades were hurled at him by two unidentified men. 
It happened in a Shiite holy city 50 miles from Baghdad, wherein the 
past there has been opposition to Saddam Hussein. It's bound to rise 
suspicions among some Iraqis that U.S. support of saddam's opposition 
may have prompted the attack. Morton dean, ABC News.
