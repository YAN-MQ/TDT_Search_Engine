Jack Kevorkian, has he finally gone too far? Hi just may have. In 
fact, he hopes so. Tonight, a new debate over the right to die. Iraq 
more defiance, more tough talk of the U.S. being criticized for letting 
Saddam Hussein off the hook too many times. President Clinton pk returns 
to Washington tonight. Where does the impeachment effort go from here? 
And from "dateline NBC," a question of loyalty. Betty Currie is not 
the only assistant to be tested when the heat's on the boss. Good 
Monday evening to you. In addition to those headline stories tonight, 
a record setting day on Wall Street. We'll get the take of Y NBC's 
Ron Insana. We'll have our regular Monday evening look at what's on 
the covers and inside the newsweeklies and what will be on the front 
pange of the Tuesday morning papers.
