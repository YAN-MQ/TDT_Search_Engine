A global oil glut, last year's relatively warm North American winter, 
weakened economies in Asia and 11-year-low prices spell trouble for 
OPEC as oil ministers convene this week, analysts said Monday. Oil 
ministers from the cartel were gathering Monday ahead of Wednesday's 
year-end meeting to discuss how to lift prices. ``They don't know 
really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo at the moment,'' said 
Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies 
in London. Oil prices are flirting with a 12-year low reached in June 
with January Brent futures trading at dlrs 11.74 a barrel in London 
on Monday. Average OPEC oil prices in the third quarter are dlrs 12.33 
a barrel, compared to dlrs 18.03 this time last year. Production cuts 
agreed to in June in an effort to boost prices haven't had the desired 
effect. The cuts lowered production by 2.6 million barrels per day. 
``They're meeting at a difficult time because the cuts they instituted 
in a real sense have not worked,'' said Drollas. Instead, prices stayed 
flat most of the summer and have weakened again. The main problem 
will be hard to fix _ for once, the oil-hungry world just doesn't 
seem to want as much of its most vital commodity as it used to, Drollas 
said. ``The villain of the piece has been demand. Incremental demand 
has decreased,'' he said. The weak market is the result of a mixture 
of factors _ an unfortunate decision last winter to boost production, 
leading to a glut; a warmer-than-average winter in many places, cutting 
demand for heating oil; over-production by several OPEC members; and 
weakened world demand, especially in Asia. For OPEC economies, the 
drop in income is threatening to balloon budget deficits. Saudi Arabia, 
which produces 8 million barrels a day and is OPEC's largest producer, 
depends on oil revenues for 70 percent of its income. This year, those 
revenues are expected to fall 27 percent below target, bringing in 
dlrs 25.3 billion, the Saudi British Bank forecast in a report issued 
Monday. At current prices, Saudi Arabia is looking at a deficit in 
1999 of about dlrs 9 billion the bank estimated. Real economic growth 
would fall to 1.7 percent for 1998, compared to 7 percent last year. 
Next year doesn't look much better. ``The prolonged period of relatively 
low oil prices has persuaded most oil forecasters to be conservative 
about 1999,'' the bank said. Bolstering prices will need at least 
an agreement in Vienna to extend June's cuts to the end of 1999. Currently, 
they are due to run out mid-1999. Failure to extend could lead to 
a rout in prices. ``The market won't take it lightly,'' Drollas warned. 
Another option _ instituting deeper production cuts _ is unlikely, 
Iran's deputy oil minister intimated last week. That would be ``too 
much for OPEC to handle at the moment,'' Mehdi Hosseini said at a 
London oil conference. Venezuela, a major player, has any way ruled 
out further cuts to its present quota of 2.32 million barrels a day. 
Worse, several countries _ including Venezuela _ aren't sticking to 
the cuts. Most analysts believe Venezuela is producing around 100,000 
more barrels a day than the 2.32 million it is officially permitted. 
And Indonesia, whacked by its imploded currency and other economic 
troubles, is complying to the tune of only 50 percent, analysts believe. 
Tighter compliance is ``an absolute imperative,'' Drollas said. ``The 
logic is clear. You can't talk about further cuts if you can't comply 
so far.''
