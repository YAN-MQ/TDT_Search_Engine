The big computer news is the negotiations between AOL and Netscape. 
AOL is close to buying Netscape for $4 billion in stock. It would 
unite two of the biggest names. Here to explain all that is ABC's 
Bob Jamieson. America online and Netscape serve different parts of 
the online audience. Together, they could become a power house. America 
online has 14 million paid subscribers to its network of entertainment, 
information and popular chat rooms. Netscape has the most popular 
technology for finding your way around the internet, the Netscape 
navigator, and 20 million a month visit its web page. Netscape, for 
America online would provide them not only with a larger base of customers, 
a larger base of usage, but essentially a larger portal to access 
the entire Internet space. Another company, sun Microsystems, could 
also become part of the deal. Sun has popularized Java, an Internet 
program language that does not depend on Microsoft windows technology 
software. Together, AOL, Netscape and sun, would pose a credible challenge 
to giant microsoft, which has been investing heavily in online ventures. 
So combined, they have a much larger audience, at least starting the 
surfing experience that Microsoft has right now. Microsoft has fought 
with all three companies in the market place and in court. And at 
the antitrust trial in Washington, Microsoft is charged with using 
strong-armed tactics against Netscape. Microsoft lawyers said today's 
news bolsters their defense. The proposed deal demonstrates a simple 
truth -- that there is vigorous competition in the market place. The 
combination of AOL and Netscape could grab a large share of the rapidly 
growing Internet commerce, sales from advertising and electronic storefronts 
that just four years from now could total $3 trillion. Bob Jamieson, 
ABC News, New York.
