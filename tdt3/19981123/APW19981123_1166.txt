Western officials on Monday praised an Albanian referendum on a draft 
constitution that would allow Albanians to legally change their religion. 
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored 
Sunday's vote on the country's first post-communist constitution, 
said voting was ``peaceful throughout the nation.'' Drafted with Western 
legal advice, the constitution also would give citizens the right 
to identify themselves as members of an ethnic minority. It also would 
define property rights and allow the government to expropriate land 
deemed of national interest. Opposition leaders call these clauses 
``anti-Albanian'' and predict many people will turn away from Islam, 
the dominant religion, to avoid discrimination while working in richer, 
non-Muslim countries. They also say the expropriation clause smacks 
of communism. But the OSCE slammed the opposition Democratic Party 
_ which boycotted the election _ for ``disinformation'' and ``unfounded 
allegations,'' blaming it for creating ``an atmosphere of extreme 
polarization.'' Final results will be available in a few days, but 
most voters were apparently government supporters and the draft was 
likely to pass. Albania's Central Voting Commission said about 51 
percent of the population participated in the referendum, despite 
a steady rain and the opposition boycott. Democratic Party leader 
Sali Berisha, who resigned as president last year, claimed police 
launched a nationwide campaign of intimidating voters and stealing 
ballot boxes. He also said officials lied about turnout and claimed 
no more than 38 percent of the 1.9 million eligible voters cast ballots. 
OSCE officials said they saw none of the alleged irregularities, but 
said many voter lists were inaccurate. Shortly before the OSCE statement, 
Berisha gathered about 2,000 supporters in downtown Tirana who screamed 
for the downfall of the government and the ouster of the OSCE chief 
in Albania. Berisha worked supporters into a fervor with angry speeches, 
accusing the government of rigging the referendum. ``If this government 
wants to manipulate votes it will have to step over our bodies,'' 
he shouted on the city's central Skanderbeg Square.
