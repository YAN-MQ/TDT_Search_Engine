Five North Carolina State athletes and a former athlete faced criminal 
charges Monday in connection with the slaying of a gunman who was 
killed with his own gun. Among the three reserve football players 
charged was David Stringer, the son of Rutgers women's basketball 
coach C. Vivian Stringer. His cousin, Korey Stringer, plays for the 
Minnesota Vikings NFL football team. Police say Neil Davis Jr., 21, 
an N.C. State student from Fayetteville, was shot about 2:30 a.m. 
Sunday. He died about six hours later at Wake Medical Center, hospital 
spokeswoman Marilyn Eddinger said. Raleigh Police Capt. Mike Longmire 
said Davis was shot with a 9 mm semiautomatic pistol after a struggle 
with the six students. The six had been attending an off-campus party 
a few doors down from Davis' home. Clyde Blunt faces the most serious 
charges. The 20-year-old sophomore wrestler, a collegiate heavyweight 
champion, was charged with involuntary manslaughter because investigators 
say his aggressive behavior resulted in Davis' death. Blunt also faces 
charges of misdemeanor breaking and entering. The three reserve football 
players _ Harold Jackson, Willie Wright and Stringer _ were charged 
with misdemeanor breaking and entering and misdemeanor assault. Wright, 
19, also was charged with larceny of a firearm. Jackson, 20, and Stringer, 
19, also were charged with accessory to a felony for helping Wright 
take the weapon, Longmire said. Michael Mordarski, a 20-year-old wrestler, 
and Daniel Scott Campenella, 21, an N.C. State student and former 
wrestler, were charged with misdemeanor breaking and entering. Mordarski 
and Campenella were released on their own recognizance Sunday night. 
The three football players secured bonds, and Blunt was in the Wake 
County Jail on a dlrs 5,000 bond.
