The merger negotiations between America Online and Netscape Communications 
could add some wrinkles to the government's anti-trust case against 
Microsoft. From member station WNYC, Carrie Nolan reports. A top lawyer 
for Microsoft said today that merger discussions between AOL and Netscape 
will serve to undercut the federal government's case against his company. 
Attorney William Newcombe maintains that in light of the talks, Microsoft's 
competitors have always had the ability to successfully compete against 
the computer giant. The government and 20 states have charged that 
Microsoft operates an illegal monopoly in the computer software marketplace. 
AOL and Netscape have confirmed their talks but say that nothing has 
been finalized. The proposed merger could also involve Sun Microsystems, 
which would enable that company to distribute its Java technology 
to AOL's 14 million subscribers. For NPR News, I'm Carrie Nolan in 
New York.
