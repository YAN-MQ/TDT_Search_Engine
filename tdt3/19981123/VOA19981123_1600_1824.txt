I'm John Burchard, VOA News. Iraq has delivered another letter to 
the United Nations Security Council explaining why it has not handed 
over documents requested by Chief U.N. Arms Inspector Richard Butler. 
Iraq insists some of the documents do not exist and others are not 
relevant. U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen says a lot of questions 
need to be answered to determine whether Iraq is cooperating fully 
with U.N.'s weapons inspectors as it promised. When, for example, 
were these chemicals or biologicals destroyed, where, under what circumstances, 
what records were made of the destruction efforts. All of that would 
be, I think, critically important to determining whether or not the 
Iraqis in fact are cooperating with so it can lead to a determination 
that they are in compliance with the security council resolutions. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen.
