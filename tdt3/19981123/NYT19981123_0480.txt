When Connecticut Gov. John Rowland offered the New England Patriots 
a sweet deal to build a $350 million stadium in Hartford last week, 
he must not have done his research about the many sweet deals in the 
National Football League. Rowland did the standard stuff, like most 
government officials eager to make their cities big-time by bringing 
in the NFL: He would build the stadium at no cost to the Patriots' 
owner, Robert Kraft, would let the team keep all revenues except a 
10 percent ticket tax that would go to the state, and would have Kraft 
invest $75 million in a hotel in the downtown Adriaen's Landing development 
for which the stadium would serve as an anchor. The most unusual kicker 
is the proposal for the state to guarantee the sale of club seats 
and luxury suites. A quick call around the league would have informed 
Rowland that if it is anyone's job to guarantee sales of the most 
expensive seats in the joint, it is the business community's, not 
the government's. But in the memorandum of understanding between the 
state and the Patriots, Rowland agreed to pay up to $10 million if 
the sale of 6,000 club seats brings in $20 million or less, and as 
much as $7.5 million if the sale of 125 luxury suites brings in $5 
million or less. And Rowland promised to sweeten his promise by offering 
to raise the guarantees when leaguewide club seat and luxury suite 
prices rise. Club seats are more comfortable seats with waiter service. 
Luxury suites are the special enclosed boxes with seats and refreshments. 
Underlying the state's guarantees is a dangerous assumption: that 
the Patriots can market club seats at the huge price of $5,000 each 
for a season. There are club seats that cost $5,000, but only at Giants 
Stadium, which created only 120 of them this season for the Jets and 
Giants. Nowhere else do club seats sell for more than $2,975. In rabid 
Cleveland, no Browns club seat costs more than $2,500. At year-old 
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, Washington Redskins fans pay $995 to $2,500 
for 15,044 club seats. But 6,000 club seats at $5,000 per seat in 
Hartford? ``That's just way overpriced,'' said John Moag, chairman 
of the Maryland Stadium Authority, which built Ravens Stadium. ``It 
could be very significant exposure for the government. It's a huge 
risk.'' During his talks with Art Modell, the Ravens' owner, Moag 
said that financial guarantees for premium seating were not discussed. 
``It's the team's job to sell those seats,'' he said. Of Rowland's 
guarantees, Moag said, ``It's a backdoor subsidy for the team.'' Last 
week, Rowland said that all elements of the package were required 
to get the deal done. ``Every one of the items was carefully negotiated,'' 
he said. The pricing of the proposed luxury suites, at an average 
of $100,000 each, is more sensible, but still on the high end. An 
average of $100,000 assumes that some will be higher, some will be 
lower, and may have a price range similar to those at Cooke Stadium, 
where they sell for $45,000 to $160,000 each. That may be fine for 
the wealthy Washington market, but will such pricing play for the 
Patriots if they move from a dump of a stadium in Foxboro, Mass., 
to a palatial 68,000-seat estate in Hartford? Will fans buy club seats, 
which they have never had to buy before, or pay a hefty increase from 
Foxboro's 35 luxury suites, which cost from $33,000 to $125,000? The 
club seat pricing may be part of a strategy to reap income at the 
higher level to keep regular ticket prices moderate. The thought is 
noble but probably impractical. Given that club seats selling at $5,000 
are 68 percent pricier than any other in the league outside Giants 
Stadium, well-heeled Patriots fans would have to think that Kraft 
is nature's nobleman to pay so dearly for a cushioned seat and waiters. 
The maximum that Kraft would reap from selling all club seats and 
luxury suites is $42.5 million _ $45 million if 150 sky boxes are 
built. Kraft could achieve it with a scintillating marketing plan 
_ ``Buy a Club Seat, Sit With Steve Grogan!'' _ that legitimately 
sells all the pricey perches, or he could sell most of them and Uncle 
John would pay off on the ones that go unsold. ``To succeed, they're 
going to have to market to a very wide area,'' said Sean Brenner, 
editor of Team Marketing Report, a trade publication. For Kraft, Rowland's 
guarantee was irresistible. Who would reject such generosity? But 
savvier thinking should inform the final lease, if the terms of the 
memorandum are approved by the state legislature by Dec. 31. First, 
Connecticut is being generous enough to build the stadium; it should 
not further subsidize a private business. Second, the price of the 
club seats and luxury boxes should be cut to accommodate the local 
market. Hartford is not suburban Baltimore or Charlotte, and the Patriots 
are not some virgin market's expansion team or a Super Bowl winner.
