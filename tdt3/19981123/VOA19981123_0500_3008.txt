Forty-six U.S. states and five U.S. territories have agreed to a $206 
billion settlement with tobacco companies. An agreement is to be finalized 
later today. The 46 states that accepted the deal had not yet settled 
or not yet filed lawsuits against the industry. The 4 other of the 
50 U.S. states had previously settled claims with tobacco firms. The 
states faced a deadline on Friday to accept or reject the deal. Martin 
Filbun, tobacco analyst with Sullivan Smith Barney says the deal is 
a good one for both sides. This deal is the single biggest litigation 
threat from the U.S. tobacco industry, so it's clearly a good deal 
for the industry. It's also a good deal for the states. $260 billion 
in total to all 50 states over 25 years, and the removal of all tobacco 
billboards. We've seen the last of the billboards. I mean, there are 
no more going out as of now, and over the next few months they'll 
all come down. So it's a good deal for both sides. Mr. Filbun says 
the deal takes care of about 3/4 of all litigation currently standing 
against the U.S. tobacco industry.
