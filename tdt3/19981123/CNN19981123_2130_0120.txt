Prosecutors in Michigan are deciding whether to take up a legal challenge 
issued by Jack Kevorkian involving the death of a 52-year-old man 
and a Dramatic videotape shown on national television. Ed Garsten 
has details. Oakland county prosecutor David gorcyca isn't taking 
Jack kevorkian's bait just yet. I can state that I find that Kevorkian's 
attempt to challenge the statute prohibiting assisted suicide in the 
state of Michigan to be a disingenuous media ploy to garner publicity 
for himself at the expense of Mr. youk and his family. It's not about 
publicity, it's about getting the issue discussed and getting the 
issue out into the open. While prosecutor gorcyca is holding his cards 
for now, he may have already tipped his hand. After viewing the edited 
portions of the video last night, it appeared a Homicide was committed 
in violation of laws of the state of Michigan, however, a charging 
decision will not be made until the videotapes are viewed in their 
entirety. Kevorkian's new attorney promised a detective the tape would 
be turned over as soon as Tuesday. So you are willing to cooperate, 
we can get -- and I can have my detectives get a hold of you? Certainly. 
So that we can make arrangements for -- Well, we -- -- An interview 
Dr. Kevorkian and the tape as we stated? The director of the hospice 
that cared for Thomas youk said she and her staff have seen enough 
and they're outraged. The team who worked so intently with him and 
the nurse especially, who just spent hours and hours of time and energy 
into resources, just felt so used and abused. In three previous trials, 
Kevorkian has been acquitted on five separate counts, partly because 
jurors have felt sympathy for the people kevorkian helped die. But 
in all those cases, it was the patient who pushed the button or threw 
the switch that led to their deaths. In the case of Thomas youk, Kevorkian 
did the job himself. And now many legal analysts believe he's crossed 
a line that will spell the end of his legal luck. Ed Garsten, CNN,
