The State Department says it's working with Turkey, Italy and Germany 
in an effort to resolve the dispute over Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah 
Ocalan. Ocalan was jailed in Rome on a German warrant, but Turkey 
wants him extradited to Istanbul to stand trial for what it says are 
terrorist attacks that killed thousands of people. Italy has refused 
to extradite Ocalan to Turkey in keeping with its policy of not extraditing 
people to countries that have the death penalty if they're wanted 
for capital crimes.
