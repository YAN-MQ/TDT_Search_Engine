After negotiators failed to come up with a settlement in a nine-hour 
session that ended shortly after 3 a.m. Monday, public school teachers 
stayed off the job for a third day, leaving schools with few adults 
in charge and many students absent. The city's five high schools remained 
closed, and district officials said they probably would be closed 
again on Tuesday. The grammar schools, with children from pre-kindergarten 
through eighth grade, were again reduced to half-day schedules. District 
officials said attendance Monday was about 35 percent. ``We made small 
progress last night,'' said Frank Sinatra, the district's business 
administrator. ``We at least narrowed the number of people who will 
sit at the negotiating table to two for each side.'' But both sides 
said there was little if any progress on issues such as salary increases, 
teacher evaluations and the district's proposal to extend the school 
day and the school year. Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for Thomas Favia, 
president of the Jersey City Education Association, which represents 
the 2,500 teachers and 1,000 support personnel, said teachers were 
more concerned about an evaluation system that does not give them 
much chance to respond to reports by teams of educators who come in, 
unannounced, to review their classroom work. Ms. Joseph said that 
at the session that ended early on Monday, union representatives typed 
up a proposal on ways to change the evaluation system that was similar 
to one in place at the Newark schools. The exchange between the two 
sides, she said, illustrated why there had been such little movement 
since last week. ``Their answer was no,'' Ms. Joseph said. ``In most 
negotiations, one side gives the other side a proposal, and the other 
side comes back and says, `Well, I can deal with this, but I want 
to modify that.' You get an idea for what the other side can live 
with. No _ you can't live with that kind of attitude.'' Representatives 
for the two sides were to meet again tonight for an informal session. 
If the strike continues until Tuesday, the union risks being fined 
$100,000 a day. Union lawyers will be in court Tuesday to argue against 
the fine, and against the back-to-work order imposed last week by 
Judge Martin Greenberg of Hudson County Superior Court. Sinatra said 
that the district is intent on making teachers more accountable about 
the work they perform, because the district has been under state control 
for about 10 years for poor performance, and has to demonstrate that 
it is serious about making changes.
