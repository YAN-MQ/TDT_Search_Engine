Law enforcement officers around the nation will be cracking down this 
week on parents who don't buckle up their children. 5,000 agencies 
plan to issue tickets, increase patrols or set up road blocks to catch 
offenders. The week-long semi-annual campaign aims to increase seatbelt 
use and reduce traffic fatalities. Car crashes are listed as the leading 
cause of death for U.S. children. Government statistics show six out 
of 10 children who died in car crashes last year were not wearing 
a seatbelt.
