If you're traveling this Thanksgiving, expect plenty of company. Kalin 
Thomas-Samuel tells us just how crowded it will be, in our "working 
ahead" report. Thanksgiving is the busiest travel holiday of the year. 
Thanksgiving travel is very concentrated. That's why we always have 
record crowds on the day before Thanksgiving and the Sunday and Monday 
after Thanksgiving. According to aaa, more than 33.5 million Americans 
are expected to travel 100 miles or more from home. As usual, most 
of them are going by car, about 82%, but a surprising number, about 
17.5%, will go by airplane. And that means busy airports. We've seen 
traffic increase over the last few years. The economy is still healthy 
and good. People have money to spend. And probably the most important 
thing is that there are good airfares out there, so people are taking 
advantage of it. The Sunday after Thanksgiving is traditionally the 
busiest day of the year, with airlines planning to fill close to 89% 
of seats. The air transport association says Thanksgiving day is the 
best time to travel, when planes are expected to be less than half 
full. Tickets please. Amtrak is planning for nearly 290,000 riders 
in the northeast alone for the holiday period. It's running 70 extra 
trains and adding thousands of extra seats to existing trains to meet 
customer demand. And where are people traveling? It's not unusual 
to see a Thanksgiving vacation taking place at a resort or in some 
other area. But the traditional visit to grandma's house is still 
tops, with 63% of travelers planning to stay with friends and family.
