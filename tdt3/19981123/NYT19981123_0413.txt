Susan McDougal, President Clinton's former partner in the Whitewater 
real estate deal, was acquitted Monday on all nine counts that she 
forged checks and credit card receipts to steal $50,000 from the conductor 
Zubin Mehta and his wife, Nancy, and then failed to pay state income 
taxes on the money. As the clerk in Superior Court here read out verdict 
after verdict of ``not guilty'' on Monday afternoon, Ms. McDougal 
seemed to struggle to hold back tears, finally embracing her lawyers 
and brushing her brow with her hand, as Mrs. Mehta sat impassively 
in a front row seat in the courtroom. ``I'm overcome,'' a tearful 
Ms. McDougal said in a corridor as she hugged friends and supporters 
after the verdicts. ``I just thank everyone who's helped me.'' The 
verdict ended an occasionally tumultuous 11-week trial, in which Judge 
Leslie Light repeatedly admonished the voluble Ms. McDougal to refrain 
from speaking out of turn. For months, Ms. McDougal and her lawyer 
had contended that the embezzlement charges were politically motivated, 
brought by the authorities here in collusion with the independent 
counsel, Kenneth Starr _ a charge both state prosecutors and Starr 
flatly denied. But the verdict did not end Ms. McDougal's legal odyssey. 
She is due in federal court in Little Rock, Ark., in February to answer 
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice charges stemming from 
her refusal to answer Starr's questions in the Whitewater investigation, 
and could face up to 12 years in prison if convicted. Since last spring, 
Ms. McDougal has been on probation from her 1996 conviction by Starr 
for her role in fraudulently obtaining a $300,000 loan, some of which 
later went to pay debts of the Whitewater Development Co., in which 
she and her husband were partners with Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
Previously, she had been held in jail for 18 months on a civil contempt 
citation obtained by Starr for failing to answer questions in the 
Whitewater investigation. After Monday's verdict, Ms. McDougal's lawyer, 
Mark Geragos, said exultantly of Starr, ``They're not going to be 
able to throw this around anymore.'' And her longtime fiancee, Pat 
Harris, who threw himself onto Ms. McDougal's brother, Bill Henley, 
in the courtroom and sobbed as the verdicts were read, shouted in 
the hallway: ``Tell Ken Starr we're coming to Arkansas. We're coming 
home and this time, we're fighting back!'' In Washington, Starr's 
office issued a statement saying the case was ``unrelated to the work 
of this office'' and that it would therefore be ``inappropriate to 
comment.'' In a brief news conference after the verdict, several jurors 
said that, after reviewing all the evidence, they were surprised and 
even angered that the case _ first filed in 1993 _ had ever been brought 
at all. But they made it plain that they voted to acquit Ms. McDougal 
after three days of deliberations not because of any conspiracy theories 
but because they did not accept the prosecution's argument that Ms. 
McDougal, as a bookkeeper and assistant to Mrs. Mehta from 1989 to 
1992, bilked a trusting but ``essentially clueless,'' employer out 
of tens of thousands of dollars in extravagant spending sprees. Instead, 
they said, they saw the case as a friendship gone sour. One juror, 
Nancy Nieman, a professor at Santa Monica College, described ``two 
women without very clear boundaries'' who had ``melded together,'' 
and added that ``when they break, it's very brittle.'' Throughout 
the trial, the defense portrayed Mrs. Mehta, a former actress, as 
the lonely spouse of a famous husband with a wandering eye, who became 
obsessed with Ms. McDougal, showered her with gifts and authorized 
most of the spending. The jury forman, Rufus Gifford, an actor, said 
the turning point for him was Mrs. Mehta's own testimony, that there 
were ``too many holes in her story,'' and that she should have known 
Ms. McDougal was using a credit card issued in both their names. ``It 
just didn't make any sense, '' he said. The prosecutor, Jeffrey Semow, 
contended that Ms. McDougal stole to recreate the wealthy lifestyle 
she enjoyed before the collapse of her marriage and of the Arkansas 
business empire of her former husband, the late James McDougal, with 
whom she ran the failed Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan Co. At 
one point, Zubin Mehta, the former conductor of both the New York 
and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras, interrupted a concert schedule 
to testify that his wife was not a compulsive shopper and that their 
spending habits should not be on trial. But he acknowledged that what 
he knew of the family's finances was told to him by his wife of some 
30 years, and the juror, Ms. Nieman, said: ``I don't think he knew 
what was going on in his home.'' Ms. McDougal was originally charged 
with 12 felony counts, accusing her of stealing more than $150,000 
from the Mehtas while working for them from 1989 through 1992. But 
10 days ago, Light granted a defense motion to dismiss three of the 
counts, relating to Ms. McDougal's acquisition and use of a credit 
card in her and Mrs. Mehta's name, and lowered the amount she was 
accused of taking to $50,000.
