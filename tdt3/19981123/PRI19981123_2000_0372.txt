This is The World. I'm Lisa Mullins. Iraq is getting personal. The 
government today stepped up its attacks on Richard Butler over his 
demand for more arms-related documents. Today, an editorial in a state-run 
newspaper accused the chief UN weapons inspector of having personal 
motives to create a new crisis. That new crisis began when Baghdad 
refused to hand over requested documents last Friday, saying it's 
already provided all relevant materials. In Washington today, U.S. 
defense secretary William Cohen said the military option remains open 
if Iraq fails to comply fully with the inspector's demands.
