Iraq has sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council accusing 
the UN chief weapons inspector of trying to portray Iraq as uncooperative. 
Inspector Richard Butler has requested records pertaining to Iraq's 
biological warfare programs. The letter, from Iraqi deputy prime minister 
Tariq Aziz, said that UN inspectors have already seen most such documents 
and that some of the documents requested don't exist.
