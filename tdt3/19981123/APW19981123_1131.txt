Assailants shouting anti-American slogans used stones and iron rods 
to attack a bus carrying U.S. tourists, the Iran News reported Monday. 
The attack was believed to have been triggered by reports in hard-line 
newspapers accusing the visiting Americans of being U.S. officials 
and members of the CIA posing as tourists. In Washington, State Department 
spokesman James P. Rubin rejected any claim that U.S. officials or 
CIA agents were in the group. ``We do call upon the government of 
Iran to adhere to the rule of law and protect visitors to their country,'' 
Rubin said.
