A museum exhibiting memorabilia of the Egyptian royal family _ everything 
from jewel encrusted swords to weird knickknacks _ opened to the public 
Monday inside one of the former royal palaces. The Abdeen Palace Museum, 
occupying a corner of the 29-acre (11-hectare) complex of gardens 
and gilt-walled rooms, offers Egyptians and others a glimpse into 
the lives of the until recently much maligned monarchy. ``We are beginning 
to show their nice sides which were obliterated before,'' Maj. Gen. 
Essam Shehata, deputy chief of President Hosni Mubarak's staff, said 
as he led reporters on a tour of the royal grounds Sunday. Egypt became 
a republic after a 1952 coup by army officers who ousted the late 
King Farouk. The royal family's lands and palaces were seized, Farouk 
was exiled to Italy, and official history referred to the monarchy 
as ``the squanderers of Egypt's wealth.'' The museum was built in 
the 1930s as a private exhibit for the collections King Fouad I and 
later his son, Farouk. It remained open until 1967, and its new life 
follows repairs to the palace from damage done in a 1992 earthquake. 
Visitors can see King Farouk's hundreds of swords, gold daggers and 
pistols, both ancient and modern. One item is a steel dagger which 
belonged to German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who fought against 
the British for control of Egypt in World War II. Since Farouk was 
a fan of strange knickknacks, his collection also includes a wooden 
jewelry box fitted with four miniature cannons that were designed 
to fire on any intruder who opened the box the wrong way _ from the 
front. Also displayed are some of Farouk's collection of pins with 
sayings like ``You wanna buy a duck?'' and ``Let's make a date,'' 
recalling the king's playboy reputation. More formal trappings are 
shown, too, such as crystal decanters and silver goblets emblazoned 
with the royal family's crest. The Abdeen Palace was ordered built 
by the Khedive Ismail to house visitors to the opening of the Suez 
Canal in 1869. But it took 11 years to build and was not ready in 
time for the canal's inauguration. During Sunday's tour, a modern 
note intruded on the 19th century surroundings. Songs by pop singer 
Celine Dion played from hidden speakers. The entrance fee to the museum 
is one pound (29 U.S. cents) for Egyptian students, two pounds (58 
cents) for ordinary Egyptians and 10 pounds (dlrs 3) for foreigners.
