If you've got $4.95, you can probably find one of these that looks 
just like Les Carpenter, or $3.95 you can find me. But if you've got 
some big bucks, well, you can see President Clinton, Albert Einstein 
or comedian Bill Cosby if you drop in on Robert Dorfman's workshop 
outside Baltimore, Maryland. Mr. Dorfman doesn't have the real people 
there, of course, but he does have impressive look-alikes. If he did 
have Albert Einstein there, some funeral home's going to be screaming. 
They're life-like and they're life-size sculptures that he makes for 
a living. Now these are made of plastic and they're used in various 
exhibitions. Mr. Dorfman's workshop contains molds of 800 heads ranging... 
That's a lot of heads. ... from former U.S. president Jimmy Carter 
to the late humorous Will Rogers. Can you just imagine? Hanging around, 
huh? Yes, he was a friendly sort and he had to say hello to every 
one of them, my goodness. One display Mr. Dorfman is working on will 
go to the Jimmy Carter Library in Atlanta, Georgia. The display will 
recreate the signing of the historic Middle East Peace Accord with 
figures of Mr. Carter and the late Egyptian and Israeli leaders Anwar 
Sadat and Menachem Begin. Now Mr. Dorfman's workshop contains a lot 
of things, molds of 800 heads, as we mentioned, from Jimmy Carter 
all the way to the late humorous Will Rogers. Now what's a mold head? 
a head that's been kept in the dark and fed mushrooms all the time, 
I guess. You too could have a Clinton, Carter or Cosby of your own, 
but this is not cheap. Prices for the plastic people start at $4,000, 
and if you're looking at one of us, it goes way down from there.
