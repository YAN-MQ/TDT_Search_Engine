Russian President Boris Yeltzin is in a Moscow hospital being treated 
for pneumonia, but appeared on television Monday talking with Chinese 
President Xan Zi Man who came to the hospital for their meeting. VOA's 
Gil Butler has more from Moscow. The latest health problems of the 
67-year-old Russian president have set off renewed calls for him to 
step down. Mr. Yeltzin has vowed to remain in office until 2000 when 
his term ends. He was hospitalized on Sunday with a high temperature 
and has been treated with antibiotics. An aide says his temperature 
is now normal, but did not say how long his stay in the hospital will 
be. He said some international meetings set for this month will be 
canceled. Russian television showed a smiling Boris Yeltzin talking 
with the Chinese president in his hospital room. Both he and Mr. Xan 
were wearing open-necked shirts and sweaters in keeping with the informal 
nature of the summit. Gil Butler, VOA News, Moscow.
