The voice that was silenced in St. Petersburg last Friday belonged 
to a politician, gadfly and tawny-haired grandmother. Galina Starovoitova 
was an extraordinary woman apparently slain in what's become an almost 
ordinary crime in Russia -- contract killing. Starovoitova took three 
bullets to the head as she and an aide climbed the stairs to her St. 
Petersburg apartment. She was 52 years old. Starovoitova co-chaired 
the Democratic Russia Party and was a deputy in the rough-and-tumble 
state duma, or the lower house of parliament. She was one of the most 
prominent and popular women in Russian politics. Her popularity, though, 
often came despite her politics. As Russians have watched their economy 
collapse around them, many have become disillusioned with democracy. 
But in the raucous trenches of the Russian duma, she was an aggressive 
defender of freedom. Her opponents considered her strident and abrasive, 
which Starovoitova told the world didn't bother her at all. I have, 
you know, such image like Russian iron lady, and some of our members 
of parliament, especially those whom I call these male chauvinists, 
they hate me because I behave myself as man in politics. Of course, 
not in private life. Starovoitova's private life was unsettled. She 
said her commitment to politics dissolved her family. But her political 
life was bright. She had friends in high places -- President Boris 
Yeltsin among them. She also had enemies. In her final interview, 
Starovoitova lashed out at the Communist Party for refusing to censure 
a leading member for his anti-Semitic remarks. Her killing has predictably 
caused finger-pointing, mostly at her Communist foes, although there 
is no evidence as yet pointing to the party. She is the sixth member 
of the duma killed in the past five years. Most of the attacks have 
involved business deals and corruption. But that is unlikely to be 
the finding in this case, which has shaken Russians from the Kremlin 
down. Neighbors are leaving flowers on her doorstep, and even Communist 
leaders observed a moment of silence in her honor. Galina Starovoitova 
will be buried in the same resting place as some illustrious and beloved 
compatriots, including Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Usorovsky.
