In a potentially stunning alliance which could transform the U.S. 
technology industry, American Online is in talks to buy Netscape Communications 
Corporation. a $4 billion stock transaction would leave AOL running 
Netscape's NetCenter website and distribute Netscape's popular navigator 
browser. Sun Microsystems would also be part of the deal, benefiting

software and enjoy widespread distribution among AOL's 14 million 
subscribers of its Java technology.
