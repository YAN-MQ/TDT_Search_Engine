Singapore legislators mostly endorsed painful wage cuts at the heart 
of a multibillion-dollar business cost-cutting package, but some urged 
the government Monday to share the burden by trimming taxes and other 
charges. To boost Singapore's flagging competitiveness and lift the 
city-state out of its first economic downturn in 13 years, a government-linked 
panel recently recommended a 10 billion Singapore dollar (dlrs 6 billion) 
package reducing corporate costs by about 15 percent annually. Equaling 
roughly 7 percent of Singapore's entire gross domestic product, the 
measures focus on slashing labor costs, primarily through a proposed 
5 to 8 percent wage cut and a 50 percent reduction in employers' contributions 
to workers' mandatory, state-run pension fund. Wage-related cuts constitute 
70 to 80 percent of the entire package, and many Singaporeans _ from 
blue collar workers to business and community leaders _ have questioned 
why workers should have to bear most of the burden. Members of Parliament 
debated the recommendations Monday, though the 84-seat legislature 
_ with only three opposition members _ is widely expected to adopt 
most or all of the suggestions before the current session ends Tuesday. 
Minister of Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan urged Parliament to fully 
endorse the package, arguing that the government took the same approach 
to directly reduce business costs during Singapore's last recession 
``with great effectiveness.'' Lee said the measures ``will require 
a united response from all Singaporeans to accept the painful cuts.'' 
Most legislators endorsed the main thrust of the package. ``We must 
also adjust our own living standards,'' said ruling party member Bernard 
Chen. ``We have been used to years of high growth and high wage increases, 
so much so that we don't know what bad times are. ``I think we've 
got to have some pain,'' he added. ``I think without pain, there can 
be no incentive to improve.'' But some legislators urged the government 
to dip into its some 120 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 74 billion) 
in reserves to help the economy. ``I urge the government to be bold 
and draw upon reserves now,'' said legislator and business leader 
Leong Horn Kee. He said ``public expectation is that the government 
could match'' the wage cuts, and suggested bigger rebates on personal 
income taxes and reduced levies on hiring foreign workers. Leong also 
warned that wage cuts may cause deflation rather than expansion in 
this city-state of 3 million people. Opposition leader Chiam See Tong 
urged the government to move slowly on the recommendations. If employers' 
pension contributions are cut by 50 percent, he said, there should 
be a matching cut in workers' payments to the fund. Singapore's leaders 
also could set an example by accepting a large salary cut, he said. 
``Singapore ministers are reputed to be the highest paid in the world, 
so a 25 percent cut in the ministers' salaries shall still leave them 
with a lot to live on comfortably,'' he added. He also urged the government 
to suspend the goods and services tax until the economic slump is 
over, and questioned whether the panel's long-term goal of encouraging 
risk-taking and entrepreneurship would ever work in tightly controlled, 
monolithic Singapore.
