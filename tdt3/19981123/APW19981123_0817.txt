Security forces have arrested six men suspected of receiving training 
in southern Lebanon to carry out attacks in Bahrain, the official 
Gulf News Agency reported Monday. The arrests come amid a stiff government 
crackdown against political unrest led by Shiite Muslims that has 
plagued this Gulf island for nearly four years. The agency said that 
five of the arrested men were Bahrainis, while the sixth was a Lebanese 
man identified as Suhail Mahdi Shehatah. The agency said Shehatah 
led the group, which it said had received training in south Lebanon 
to carry out terrorist and subversive activities in Bahrain. It added 
that security forces had seized weapons and explosives that the men 
were trying to smuggle into Bahrain. The men confessed to carrying 
out arson attacks and bombings in Bahrain, the agency added. It did 
not say when the men were arrested or what kind of weapons or explosives 
they were trying to smuggle into the country. Since December 1994, 
Shiite Muslims have led a violent campaign for democratic and social 
reforms that include restoration of the National Assembly, which was 
dissolved in 1975. Hundreds of activists have been detained in connection 
with the violence, which has included bombings and arson attacks. 
More than 40 people have been reported killed in the unrest. A slight 
majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens are Shiites, but the ruling 
Al Khalifa family belongs to the mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.
