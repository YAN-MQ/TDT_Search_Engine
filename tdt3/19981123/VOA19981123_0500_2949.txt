Major Asian markets closed up today amid hopes of local interest rate 
cuts. In Australia, investors were encouraged by a healthy economy. 
Stocks closed up 1.6 percent there, a half percent in New Zealand. 
Singapore and Indonesian stock values also gained, while Hong Kong's 
benchmark Hansin index closed up. Meanwhile, Hong Kong real estate 
may rebound soon. Developers say lower interest rates are making this 
a good time to buy property in Hong Kong.
