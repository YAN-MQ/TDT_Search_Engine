Good evening. Just in time for Thanksgiving, record reasons for stock 
market investors to be thankful. The Dow today closed at an all-time 
high just six weeks after many were saying this long bull run was 
over. By the end of the day, the Dow was up over 214 points, and the 
NASDAQ, up over 49 points. The Dow has gained almost 2,000 points 
since early October. NBC's chief financial correspondent Mike Jensen 
is live on Wall Street with a look at this record day. Michael? Tom, 
it was a buying frenzy here on Wall Street -- big investors, small 
investors, all ages, from all over the country. Everybody wanting 
to get on board. 3:49 this afternoon, a flood of buy orders sends 
the Dow shooting past its old record set in July to a level never 
seen before, 9374. Today's surge was caused partly by big mergers, 
either announced or in the works. America online and Netscape, a $4 
billion deal. Deutsche bank and bankers trust, a $10 billion merger. 
Also helping, more good news on the economy. There'll be lots of jobs 
next year. Manpower, the temporary help company, surveyed more than 
15,000 U.S. businesses, and found that most of them will either keep 
all their workers or hire more. Hardly any will be cut. The serging 
market needs a booster. And companies being taken over is the biggest 
signal of confidence around. What's different from last summer, when 
the stock market fell almost 2,000 points, and experts predicted a 
recession? For one thing, Alan Greenspan and the federal reserve cut 
interest rates three times. Then the foreign problems that were beginning 
to hurt the U.S. economy calmed down when Japan voted to spend billions 
of dollars to bail out its banks and spend its way out of a recession. 
And the international monetary fund came to the rescue of Brazil, 
with help from the U.S. meantime, American consumers keep right on 
spending. Retailers predict a strong holiday shopping season. All 
that has investors feeling it's safe to put their money back into 
the stock market. Stocks have shot up 24% since late summer. And for 
the year, the Dow is up 18%. nasdaq up 25%. With unemployment low, 
almost no inflation, interest rates falling, shoppers buying, the 
economy looks solid. tom. Thanks very much. Mike Jensen on Wall Street.
