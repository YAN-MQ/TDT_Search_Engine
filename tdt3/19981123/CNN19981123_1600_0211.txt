Iraq's envoy to the United Nations says his country no longer has 
any documents that are related to disarmament. U.N. inspectors have 
requested certain documents in order to put together a History of 
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs. Iraqi officials say 
the documents have already been turned over or no longer exist. They 
say chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler is making the request 
in order to justify a U.S. military strike. Meantime, U.S. defense 
secretary William Cohen says the United States still has enough forces 
in the Persian gulf to mount a military strike on Iraq.
