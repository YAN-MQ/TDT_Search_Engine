A son of former President Suharto was interrogated by the attorney 
general's office over corruption allegations Monday while troops blocked 
student protesters from marching on his father's house. Additionally, 
senior officials of the ruling Golkar Party have called for Suharto 
to be put under house arrest while a new investigation into his wealth 
is conducted. On Monday, Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra was questioned 
as part of an investigation against Beddu Amang, a former chief of 
a state-run food distribution organization, the newspaper Suara Pembaruan 
reported. It quoted Anton Sujata, a government lawyer, as saying that 
Tommy earlier had been banned from leaving the country. Tommy made 
no comment. Two other Suharto sons, Bambang and Sigit, also have been 
questioned over a series of recent bank collapses. About 30 protesters 
marched through an exclusive suburb Monday, demanding that Suharto 
be put on trial for corruption and human rights abuses during his 
32-year authoritarian rule. The protest was much smaller than other 
demonstrations in recent days. Suharto, 77, was forced to quit the 
presidency in May after a wave of protests and riots, in which 1,200 
people were killed. Opponents allege he amassed a fortune and used 
his power to enrich his six children and a clique of cronies. Suharto 
has said he is innocent. On the weekend, Suharto's successor and former 
protege, President B.J. Habibie, announced a new inquiry into Suharto's 
wealth. Opposition groups denounced an earlier probe by the attorney 
general as a whitewash after it failed to identify any wrongdoing 
by the ex-head of state. Akbar Tanjung, Habibie's state secretary, 
who is also Golkar Party chairman, has reportedly backed calls for 
Suharto to be placed under house arrest. The Indonesian Observer said 
Suharto should also be banned from overseas travel.
