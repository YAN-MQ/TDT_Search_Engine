Good afternoon, I'm Chuck Roberts with "CNN Headline News." We have 
a lot to talk about. Lot of developing stories, including this one 
from Santa Monica, california. Where the Whitewater figure Susan McDougal 
is counting down some anxious moments as a jury in Santa Monica has 
reached a verdict in her embezzlement trial. It's scheduled to be 
read now in about 30 minutes. She's charged with stealing 50,000 dollars 
from conductor zubin may ta and his wife between 1989 and '92. She's 
charged with stealing 50,000 dollars. That's when she was working 
as their bookkeeper. She could get a maximum of four years in prison 
if convicted. Again we'll have the verdict for new about a half hour 
when it's read.
