First -- the Kremlin says Russian President Boris Yeltsin is feeling 
better today after being admitted to the hospital this weekend for 
pneumonia. The ailing leader had a fever of 102 degrees. But a spokesman 
says Yeltsin's temperature has returned to normal. Yeltsin did manage 
to meet with Chinese President Jiang Zemin today. But a trip to Moscow 
by the queen of Netherlands has been postponed because of the 67-year-old 
president's health. Several illnesses in the past few weeks have raised 
concern about Yeltsin's ability to lead the country in a time of economic 
crisis.
