The European Union voted Monday to lift a worldwide export ban on 
the vast majority of British beef, a milestone in the ``mad cow'' 
crisis that has pitted Britain against its EU allies for some three 
years. ``The beef ban is lifted,'' said British Farm Minister Nick 
Brown. ``The beef is safe to eat.'' Ten of the 15 EU farm ministers 
meeting here voted to scrap the ban on deboned beef, with Germany 
the lone holdout. France, Spain, Austria and Luxembourg abstained. 
The decision should clear the way to ending the crisis for British 
farmers, who were badly hit by a ban on all beef exports imposed by 
he EU in March 1996. Estimated losses from the ban amount to over 
2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.3 billion) and the crisis undermined confidence 
in beef throughout Europe. ``The question now is how to get back on 
the world markets,'' said Brown, predicting an uphill struggle to 
re-establish the reputation of British beef. Monday's decision ``will 
tend to boost the confidence of the British consumer and presumably 
other consumers throughout the EU and our beef trade and our beef 
producers will get back to normal,'' Dr. John Mann, superintendent 
of Britain's largest meat market, Smithfields, said in London. The 
move to ease the ban was boosted early this month when eight out of 
15 veterinary experts endorsed the plan to resume exports. Now, the 
issue goes back to the EU's executive Commission, which will send 
inspectors to Britain for a final examination of safety standards, 
opening the way for exports early in the new year. No more ministerial 
votes on the issue are needed. Exports were banned after Britain announced 
a possible link between ``mad cow'' disease in British cattle and 
a fatal brain ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. 
Monday's decision will be immediately followed by a campaign to put 
British beef back on the plates of consumers throughout the 15-nation 
EU. ``It will still be some months before the first shipments of beef 
actually resume and there is much work to be done to re-establish 
markets,'' said Ben Gill, president of Britain's National Farmers 
Union. In the wake of the 1996 ban, the previous Conservative government 
of Prime Minister John Major instigated a policy of non-cooperation 
with its partners which effectively paralyzed the EU for months. Relations 
improved after Tony Blair became prime minister in May 1997. EU farm 
ministers approved a resumption of beef exports from Northern Ireland 
in March. Ahead of the ban, Britain exported some 270,000 tons of 
beef, totaling some dlrs 1 billion, in 1995. Mann said he hoped exports 
would be back to such levels within a couple of years.
