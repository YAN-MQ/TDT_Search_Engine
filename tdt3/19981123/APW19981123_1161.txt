Greg Norman won't have to worry about a special invitation to next 
year's Masters. Golf's most exclusive major championship on Monday 
announced sweeping changes to its invitation list, a move that likely 
will increase the number of players in the field but also make sure 
they are among the best in the world. Effective immediately, the Masters 
will take the top 50 players from the World Golf Rankings who have 
not otherwise qualified. And starting with the 2000 Masters, winning 
a PGA Tour event will no longer be worth a ticket to Augusta National 
Golf Club. ``Our existing qualification system has served us well,'' 
said Augusta chairman Hootie Johnson. ``We think, however, our new 
methodology better reflects the changes in golf, and will ensure that 
the best players worldwide are invited to the Masters each year.'' 
The changes are the first to the invitation list since 1990, when 
members of the U.S. Ryder Cup team no longer qualified automatically 
for the Masters. Augusta National will invite the top 50 in the world 
rankings at the end of the year, as well as the top 50 in the rankings 
after the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship _ or four weeks 
before the Masters. That takes care of Norman, who is ranked No. 15 
but would not have otherwise qualified. His five-year exemption from 
winning the 1993 British Open expired this year, and he failed to 
qualify through other means because of shoulder surgery that forced 
him to miss three majors and the last six months of the PGA season. 
Others that will get in under the new guidelines include British Open 
runner-up Brian Watts, ranked No. 24, and most likely Brad Faxon at 
No. 42. Starting with the 2000 Masters, winners of PGA Tour events 
will no longer be exempt, a qualification that was first implemented 
in 1972. Had those changes been in place for next year's tournament, 
players like Olin Browne, Joe Durant and J.P. Hayes would not have 
have qualified. Among the other changes to the invitation list: _ 
The top 40 on the PGA Tour money list from the previous year, up from 
30. Also the top three on the current money list published four weeks 
before the Masters. _ The top 16, including ties, from the previous 
Masters (down from 24). _ The top 8, including ties, from the U.S. 
Open (down from 16) _ The top 4, including ties, from the British 
Open. Previously, only the winner was exempt. _ The top 4, including 
ties, from the PGA Championship (down from 8). The Masters champion 
will continue to receive a lifetime exemption, and the winner of the 
other three majors will still get a five-year exemption. Also this 
year, the winner of The Players Championship will get a three-year 
exemption instead of one. The Players traditionally has the strongest 
field and richest purse in golf. Of its 25 winners, only four have 
not won a major championship. Despite the changes, the Masters tournament 
committee will, at its discretion, invite international players who 
have not otherwise qualified.
