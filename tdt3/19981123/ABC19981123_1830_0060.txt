World and on Wall Street. When the bell rang, it was at a high of 
9374. Up 214 points today. And there were no fewer than ten corporate 
mergers today. Several of them enormous and two of them particularly 
driving a very vigorous stock market in general. First here's ABC's 
Betsy Stark. a wave of merger deals set the market on its record-breaking 
run today. News that America online is likely to acquire Netscape 
charged up technology stocks and talk of a deal between banking giants 
Deutschebank in germany and American-owned bankers trust ignited a 
powerful rally in financial stocks. But other events set the stage 
for today's new high. Three interest-rate cuts by the federal reserve 
in just seven weeks time have reassured investors the fed stands ready 
to do what it takes to keep the healthy U.S. economy growing. The 
bottom line is the market is made up of human beings. We always go 
to extremes in our emotions. Now we're getting extreme greed and that's 
fine. Fortunately, the greed is backed up by sound fundamentals. Investors 
have also been moved by signs the crisis overseas may have stabilized. 
Money is flowing back into Asian stock markets, the Japanese have 
proposed numerous plans to shake their economy out of recession and 
the international monetary fund has shored up confidence in Brazil's 
future with a massive bailout package. It's all added up to one of 
the wildest rides in Wall Street history. Investors who believed the 
worst about where the world's economies were headed from July to September, 
pushing the Dow industrials down more than 1800 points, have now sent 
it back up just as quickly, apparently prepared to believe the best. 
Others are less sure. They say it will take strong corporate earnings 
to justify stock prices this high. With a third of of the globe still 
in recession, that could be tough.
