KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A coal miner died in hospital after being seriously 
injured in an accident at a mine in eastern Ukraine, officials said 
Monday. The unidentified worker from the Krasnopolivska mine in the 
Luhansk region died Sunday after he was badly injured by falling rocks 
at an underground shaft on Saturday, the Emergency Situations Ministry 
said. About 335 Ukrainian miners have been killed on the job so far 
this year, up from 290 for all of last year, according to government 
statistics. The death toll in coal mine accidents in Ukraine has been 
rising for years as the cash-strapped government has been unable to 
modernize deteriorating mines and improve safety conditions.
