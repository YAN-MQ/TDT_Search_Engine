What does rural England have in common with South Africa's a cappella 
rhythms? Well, more than you might think. As The World's Marco Werman 
tells us, the sounds of South Africa's Ladysmith Black Mambazo have 
found a mainstream audience, thanks to a British TV commercial for 
beans. In 1986, the members of South Africa's Ladysmith Black Mambazo 
were thrust onto the international music scene with their famous a 
cappella intro to Paul Simon's "Graceland" track, "Diamonds on the 
Soles of her Shoes." PAUL SIMON She's a rich girl. She don't try to 
hide her diamonds on the soles of her shoes. He's a poor boy... Since 
then, Ladysmith Black Mambazo has remained popular, but mostly among 
the fans of so-called world music. Now, though, they've found mass 
appeal in an unexpected way. "In Canizi Dizazi " is the title of this 
track. It means "the star and the wisemen." But to British television 
viewers, it is simply the music in the Heinz baked beans TV ad, and 
that's precisely how the track is being sold and sold big in Britain's 
record stores. The Heinz ad features the music of Ladysmith Black 
Mambazo over shots of a British homemaker preparing a meal, her kids 
taking a bath -- an altogether warm, 1950s like domestic scene. In 
congress, you say, not for British telly watchers. The song has landed 
Ladysmith Black Mambazo in the top 40 in the United Kingsdom. For 
The World, this is Marco Werman.
