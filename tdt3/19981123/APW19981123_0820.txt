Wealthy and developing countries must come to agreement on a fair 
method for determining how much they pay each other for international 
phone calls, the future chief of the U.N. telecommunications agency 
said Monday. The dispute over the ``accounting rate system'' is one 
of the one of the major topics which needs to be resolved, said Yoshio 
Utsumi, designated new director general of the International Telecommunications 
Union. Industrialized countries complain that they have to pay developing 
countries too much for receiving international calls. Costs must be 
linked to the actual cost of the call, Utsumi, who takes over Feb. 
1, told a news conference. The originating company charges the caller 
making the long-distance call and then has to pay a portion of the 
fee to the receiving country for making the connection to its customer. 
Until now, the charges were weighted to help the developing world 
improve its telecommunications facilities, Utsumi said. ``The direction 
in which we all have to go is to cost-based charges, but we need some 
time to adjust to that,'' said Utsumi. The 56-year-old, who is deputy 
minister of the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, 
also stressed the importance of involving private companies in the 
ITU as more and more countries privatize their systems and open them 
up to competition. The importance of combating the Millennium Bug 
could not be emphasized too much, added Utsumi. Computer programmers 
are scrambling to avert disaster on New Year's Day 2000 when computer 
systems may fail because they only recognize the last to digits of 
a year and assume it is 1900.
