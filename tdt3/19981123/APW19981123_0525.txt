Militiamen loyal to Hussein Aidid killed at least six rival fighters 
in driving the Rahanwein Resistance Army from a base near a key Somalia 
town, a commander said Monday. Aidid's men on Sunday gained control 
of a base the RRA recently established near Baidoa, about 150 kilometers 
(95 miles) northwest of Mogadishu, one of Aidid's commanders said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. The commander said six RRA militiamen 
were killed in the clashes. He did not comment on casualties on Aidid's 
side. Initially, Aidid's forces were beaten back and had to seek reinforcements 
of pickup trucks mounted with weapons, the commander said. But later, 
RRA fighters were dislodged from the base. Baidoa is a strategic town 
because it has a major runway which can be used to resupply troops. 
It was slated as a venue for a reconciliation conference first set 
for Feb. 15, but repeatedly postponed for lack of money and Aidid's 
refusal to withdraw his forces. Last December, 24 other faction leaders, 
including Aidid, agreed in Cairo to form a government of transition 
and hold a reconciliation conference. Somalia has had no central government 
since late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 by a coalition 
of rebels who later turned against each other, splitting the country 
into fiefdoms protected by clan militias.
