Whole boneless Delmonico ribeye roast $3.59 a pound. Boneless New 
York sirloin oven roast $1.79. British beef will soon return to butcher 
shops and dinner tables around the world. Today, European agricultural 
ministers announced their decision to end the worldwide ban on British 
beef. The European Union imposed the ban in 1996 after the British 
government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and an 
equivalent illness in humans. Meat connoisseur Graham Goods, a U.S.-based 
consultant on livestock, welcomed today's lifting of the ban. The 
best beef I think is Scottish beef, which comes off very soft pastures. 
When British or European visitors come here, they love our beef for 
its tenderness, I think. When we go there, we like theirs more for 
that little extra flavor. But it's all very good. Still, don't forget 
what mom said. Eat your vegetables.
