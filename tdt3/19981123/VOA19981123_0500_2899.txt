It's Universal time, and here is the major news story of the hour 
we're following on VOA News Now. Russian President Boris Yeltzin is 
back in the hospital with pneumonia. The Kremlin says, however, that 
he is meeting -- or he's holding all of the meetings he has scheduled 
for today. He's already met with the Chinese leader, Xan Zi Man. An 
update on that story coming up in about 10 minutes. It's time now 
for VOA business news, and with that here is Victor Beatty.
