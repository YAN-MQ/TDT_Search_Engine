The battle for the men's world no. 1 tennis ranking between American 
Pete Sampros and Marcelo Rios gets underway at the ATP Tour Championships 
in Hanover, Germany, this week. Sampros is determined to finish the 
year with the no. 1 ranking for a record sixth year in a row, but 
Rios, the man U.S. magazine Sports Illustrated once called the most 
hated man in tennis, stands in his way just 33 points behind the American. 
Whichever player fares the best at the tournament will finish the 
season with the no. 1 ranking. A dream scenario would have Rios and 
Sampros facing each other in the final, but the last time they faced 
each other was at the French Open in 1994 when Sampros prevailed 7-6, 
7-6 and 6-4. The tournament gets underway Tuesday and brings together 
the top eight players in the world. Sampros and Rios will be joined 
by American Andre Agassi, Spaniards Alex Curecha and Carlos Moya, 
Carl Cucchiara of Slovakia, Britain's Tim Henman and Yefghene Kevelnikov 
of Russia.
