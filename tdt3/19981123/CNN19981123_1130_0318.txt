President Clinton is En route back to Washington from Asia at this 
hour. Earlier today, hundreds of people turned out to see Mr. Clinton 
when he made a brief stop in Guam. Guam's officials greeted him warmly, 
but took the time to point out that residents have only limited representation 
in Washington because of the pacific island's status as a U.S. territory. 
Mr. Clinton announced plans to rejuvenate Guam's economy in the face 
of the asian economic crisis. In the last year, the economic tides 
that once brought prosperity all across the pacific have blown cold 
winds into the economies of Japan and korea. They have been felt all 
the way to Guam and Hawaii. We have to work together with our friends 
to restore economic growth and opportunity and to stand up for freedom. 
And we will.
