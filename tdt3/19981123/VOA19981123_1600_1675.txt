American actor Peter Berg recently made his debut as a film director 
making a movie titled Very Bad Things. Experience taught him at least 
one very surprising thing: it is relatively easy to find a three-legged 
dog to act in a movie. Well, I didn't know that. Berg wanted a three-legged 
dog in the film, but to create the illusion of one would require sophisticated 
computer effects that the film could not afford. So at the suggestion 
of a colleague, he contacted an agency that handles unusual animals. 
Within 4 hours, reports Berg, three dogs, each with three legs, were 
auditioning for the film Very Bad Things.
