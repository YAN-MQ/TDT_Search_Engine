Elsewhere around the country today, in Chicago, police looked but 
they did not find any more victims of the 1978 serial killer John 
Wayne gacy. They excavated an area where a Chicago police officer 
said he saw gacy carrying a shovel 23 years ago. He was executed in 
1994 for killing 33 men and boys.
