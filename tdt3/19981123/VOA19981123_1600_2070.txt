European Union agriculture ministers have agreed to lift the world-wide 
export ban on British beef. The ban will now be taken up by the European 
Commission which will send inspectors to Britain for a final examination 
of safety standards. Exports of British beef were banned in March 
1996 when Britain announced a possible link between mad cow disease 
in British beef and a fatal human brain condition.
