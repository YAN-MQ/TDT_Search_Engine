A plan to raise a Christmas tree adorned with condoms in the Central 
Park skating rink for an AIDS-prevention event was canceled Monday 
after a Catholic group urged the rink's private operator not to allow 
the tree, the group said. The city's Parks Department, whose approval 
would have been needed, had also expressed concerns about the appropriateness 
of the event, which was to include a concert and a tree-lighting ceremony 
on Dec. 1 at the Wollman Rink, parks officials said. The event was 
to have been sponsored by Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. William Donohue, 
president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, said 
he was delighted when officials of the Makkos Organization, which 
operates the rink, told him they would not allow the event. Makkos 
officials did not return numerous telephone messages Monday evening 
seeking to confirm that the event had been canceled. Donohue had threatened 
to call for a holiday-season boycott of Levi Strauss if the tree went 
up in the rink. Levi Strauss officials said they had not heard from 
the Makkos Organization. They said another venue for the event would 
be found if it were not allowed to be held at Wollman Rink. ``This 
is not about Wollman Rink,'' said Cassie Ederer, a spokeswoman for 
Levi Strauss, which is based in San Francisco. ``It's about AIDS awareness.'' 
Ms. Ederer said Monday was the first she had heard that the event 
was in danger of being canceled. She said Makkos had cashed a $5,000 
check as a deposit and sent Levi Strauss a contract for the event 
last week; the jeans maker returned the contract by fax Monday morning, 
she said. Levi Strauss' plan was donate $1 to a music-industry AIDS-awareness 
group, Lifebeat, for every person who came to the tree-lighting ceremony 
and concert; the best-selling rapper Canibus, was scheduled to perform 
a new song advocating safe sex. The tree itself, Ms. Ederer said, 
would be an artificial 35-foot-tall pine covered with condoms in their 
wrappers, in many different colors. ``It will be a tasteful tree,'' 
Ms. Ederer said. ``It will be the Tree of Life.'' But many people, 
including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, had questioned whether it was possible 
to cover a Christian symbol in contraceptives in a tasteful way. He 
called the Levi Strauss plan ``one of the most idiotic ideas I've 
ever heard of.'' Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the Parks Department, 
said parks officials told Makkos that parents might not want their 
children to see a Christmas tree decorated with condoms. The department's 
approval is needed for all special events at the rink. ``What concerned 
us was the controversial nature of such a display in what is essentially 
a family setting,'' Skyler said. Exposing young people to images of 
condoms, however, was exactly what Levi Strauss wanted to do, Ms. 
Ederer said. She said Levi Straus had donated $20 million to AIDS 
education and awareness since 1982. Donohue said Levi Strauss was 
trying to promote homosexuality. ``They're really in the vanguard 
of setting the agenda for the corporate culture along the lines of 
the radical gay movement,'' he said, ``and this is one more demonstration 
of their ideology.''
