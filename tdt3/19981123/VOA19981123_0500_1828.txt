Russian President Boris Yeltzin has been hospitalized in Moscow with 
what doctors describe as pneumonia, but nevertheless, he still held 
a meeting with visiting Chinese leader Xan Zi Man. a Kremlin spokesman 
says Mr. Yeltzin felt ill Sunday and was taken to the state-run Central 
Clinical Hospital. He says the president had a high temperature and 
was being treated with antibiotics. Mr. Yeltzin has rarely been seen 
in public in recent weeks. Much of the day-to-day operations of the 
Russian government is being handled by Prime Minister Ugeni Primokov. 
The Kremlin says Mr. Yeltzin met with President Xan in the hospital 
on Monday for about 40 minutes. President Xan also meets with Prime 
Minister Primokov and other Russian officials before going on to Japan 
for a landmark 5-day visit. That is the first ever by a Chinese head 
of state.
