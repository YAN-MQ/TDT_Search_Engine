Teen-age star of this year's British Open as an amateur, Justin Rose 
failed to win his card for next season's European pro Tour Monday 
when he closed the qualifying competition with an 80, which included 
an eagle at the last. The 18-year-old Englishman, who tied for fourth 
at the Open at Royal Birkdale to post the highest finish for an amateur 
for 35 years, didn't win a penny in prize money after turning pro 
immediately afterwards, missing the cut in all eight tournaments he 
played. That meant he joined 180 other hopefuls in the six-round qualifying 
competition and wound up with rounds of 78-73-70-71-74-80 for a 14-over 
total of 446. Rose needed something like a 69 in the final round to 
join the top 35 and ties who won their cards. But he was out in 40 
after four bogeys in his first nine holes at the windy San Roque course. 
He needed to cover the remaining nine in 30 to stand any chance of 
making it. But he collected three more bogeys in his finishing nine, 
triple bogeyed the next-to-last hole after shooting out of bounds 
before finishing with a 20-foot eagle putt. ``I just need a break, 
it's been a long week,'' Rose said after his latest ordeal. ``I'm 
upset because I wanted to come here and make my card. But life goes 
on.'' His failure to qualify leaves Rose hoping for sponsors' invitations 
to tournaments. Otherwise it will be life on the lower grade Challenge 
Tour.
