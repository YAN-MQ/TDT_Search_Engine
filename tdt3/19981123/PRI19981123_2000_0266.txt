Russian president Boris Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia, 
his third health scare in recent weeks. But the Russian leader didn't 
hold his -- did hold his summit today with his Chinese counterpart. 
NPR's Michelle Kelleman reports from Moscow. It has been dubbed "the 
hospital summit" -- a brief meeting of Yeltsin and Chinese president 
Jiang Zemin. Yeltsin may be forced to hold more meetings in the central 
clinical hospital. He's expected to stay there up to 10 days. This 
is his second reported bout of pneumonia. The first time he had it 
was back in 1996 after he underwent heart surgery. In recent weeks, 
Yeltsin has been battling other illnesses, including bronchitis. His 
critics suggest it's time for Yeltsin to step down and call an early 
election. But his spokesman told reporters he sees no reason to do 
so. He suggested Yeltsin's illness was linked to emotional stress 
in the wake of last Friday's murder of one of his former aides -- 
a leading liberal lawmaker Galina Starovoitova. Michelle Kelleman, 
NPR News, Moscow.
