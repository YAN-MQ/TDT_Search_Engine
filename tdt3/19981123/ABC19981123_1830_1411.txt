When we come back, "your money," the cost of not asking the right 
questions. Dog, thinking: T-bone! T-bone! Looking for a T-bone! Chewy, 
meaty T-bone! At the big T-bone store! There's one! No, that's not 
one. Over there! no! no! On that shelf! ahh! Too green! Wait a minute! 
There! A whole package of little chewy, meaty T-bone steaks! Ya-hoo! 
I'm waking up! MA brought you some T bonz dog snacks. Made with real 
meat, so dogs think... Dog: it's a T-bone! Resealable T bonz brand 
from Purina. It's a T-bone!
