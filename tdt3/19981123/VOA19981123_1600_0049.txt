I'm Carol Castielle, VOA News. Iraq has delivered another letter to 
the United Nations Security Council explaining why it has not handed 
over documents requested by Chief U.N. Arms Inspector Richard Butler. 
Iraq insists some of the documents do not exist and others are not 
relevant. U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen says many questions 
need to be answered to determine whether Iraq is cooperating fully 
with U.N.'s weapons inspectors as promised.
