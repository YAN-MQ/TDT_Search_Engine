The Minnesota Vikings beat the Green Bay Packers 28-14, giving them 
a commanding three-game lead over the Packers in their NFC Central 
Division. Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham passed for 264 yards 
and two touchdowns. Star rookie wide receiver Randy Moss had eight 
receptions for 153 yards and a touchdown. The Vikings are now 10 and 
1. Packers head coach Mike Homgren admits it was a tough loss. There 
were a couple big plays that they made, you know, and they're going 
to make. I thought all in all the defense played -- our defense played 
pretty well, but, shoot, they're -- you know, just when you think 
you got it, one of those green players makes a play. Green Bay falls 
2, 7 and 4.
