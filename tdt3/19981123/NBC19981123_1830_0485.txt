Good news and bad news for two of the Clintons' friends and business 
partners. Former Whitewater partner Susan McDougal was acquitted of 
embezzling $50,000 from the conductor zubin mehta and his wife. McDougal 
worked as the mehta's bookkeeper in the early 1990s. She still faces 
yet another trial for refusing to testify against the president on 
Whitewater.
