Four Mexican fishermen are back on solid land after 40 days stranded 
at sea. An American research vessel discovered their 35-foot fishing 
boat on thursday. A day later, the coast guard towed them to Louisiana. 
The trip was supposed to be 15 days and no farther than 150 miles 
from mexico. But the engine and the radio failed. They had food and 
water to last 20 days, and then they began to eat their catch.
