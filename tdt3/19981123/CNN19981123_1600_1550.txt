Simon the dog isn't on any endangered lists, but he just might be 
one of a Kind. Simon's owner says the dog just loves to sing along 
with classical music. Jason whitely introduces us to a dog who loves 
to Bach. Good evening. The St. Louis Symphony attracts all kinds of 
fans. But you don't have to enjoy orchestras to enjoy classical music. 
French horn player Bob lauver knows a unique fan. But he has never 
heard the Symphony perform. His name's Simon. And he's 5 1/2 years 
old. You see, every time Bob practices at home, Simon starts singing. 
But Simon is picky, he won't sing to just anything. Well, he doesn't 
like any top 40. He doesn't like mozart. He's not a real big fan of 
Shuman. He does on occasion lift his ears up to Strauss. Beethoven 
is the only thing he'll really tip his head back to and get into. 
Every time Bob plays with the orchestra, Beethoven's seventh symphony 
receives audience applause. But somehow it's not the same satisfaction 
as Simon singing. Jason whitely -- What a nice voice. What a nice 
voice. -- for CNN, St. Louis.
