The Broncos continue their March on history. I'm Anthony Keith James, 
and this is "CNN Headline Sports." The curtain comes down on week 
12 tonight when the dolphins host the patriots. Miami has won two 
straight and leads the AFC east. New England has lost four of five. 
The pats are banged up, especially on the defensive line and wide 
receiver areas. We're in a survival mode right now. And we're down 
to the Bare minimum here with our depth. The kinds of injuries that 
we've had, where they've been concentrated really at two positions, 
have made things very difficult for us. In case you missed it, the 
Broncos are still perfect. They dismantled the raiders 40-14 Sunday 
to improve to 11-0. John Elway was back in the starting lineup. He 
joins Dan Marino as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to throw 
for 50,000 yards.
