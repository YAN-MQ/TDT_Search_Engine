Henry Hampton, an Emmy-winning documentary filmmaker whose series 
``Eyes on the Prize'' was hailed by many critics as the definitive 
look at the nation's early struggle over civil rights, died on Sunday 
in Boston. He was 58. Hampton had the bone marrow disease myelodysplasia, 
which arose from a treatment for lung cancer. He had surgery last 
week to repair a hematoma in his brain, said his nephew, Jacob ben-David 
Zimmerman. A lifelong chronicler of the poor and the disenfranchised, 
Hampton began his career in 1963 as a spokesman for the Unitarian 
Universalist Association in Boston, a strong voice in the civil-rights 
movement. Hampton's true moment of revelation would come two years 
later, during the ``Bloody Sunday'' march in Selma, Ala. The event, 
led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., degenerated into violence 
when police beat some 600 marchers trying to cross the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge, a moment Hampton would later credit as inspiring him to undertake 
``Eyes on the Prize.'' Hampton, who suffered from polio as a teen-ager 
and walked with a limp, was near the back of the march and watched 
the violence flare ahead of him. ``What he said he realized then was 
the enormous care and warmth of the people involved in this terrifying 
event,'' said Judy Richardson, the associate producer for ``Eyes on 
the Prize.'' ``He wanted to show their strength, not their weakness,'' 
she said. Hampton returned to Boston and in 1968 founded Blackside 
Inc., a film company whose mission, in his words, was to explore ``democracy, 
diversity, culture and civil society.'' Operating out of a book-stuffed 
office in Boston's South End, the company produced more than 60 documentaries 
and films on subjects ranging from the life of Malcolm X to the Great 
Depression. In 1976, Hampton undertook his most ambitious project, 
a six-hour survey of the civil-rights movement that would eventually 
be televised by the Public Broadcasting Service in 1987. It was a 
concept born that afternoon in Selma and fostered by what Hampton 
said was a lack of black perspective on the movement. The problem 
with most civil-rights films, Hampton said in a 1986 interview with 
The New York Times, was ``that they have always been done by whites 
who depicted black folks as poor, downtrodden and brutalized primitives.'' 
His version would show that ``it was the strength of blacks that made 
the civil-rights movement happen, with support from some whites.'' 
Beginning with the lynching of a 14-year-old Mississippi boy in 1954 
and continuing through to the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965, Hampton and his crew wove together narration, newsreels and 
interviews into a series that explored the nation's first steps in 
the direction of racial equality. ``Eyes on the Prize'' would win 
four Emmy awards and the Peabody Award for excellence in broadcast 
journalism. After a brief commercial release, the film was nominated 
for an Academy Award for best documentary. In 1990, Hampton would 
return to the subject for ``Eyes on the Prize II,'' an eight-hour 
look at the civil-rights movement from 1965 to the mid-1980s. It, 
too, was well-received and won two Emmys. The program was immediately 
preceded by a book by Hampton and Steve Fayer with Sarah Flynn, ``Voices 
of Freedom'' (Bantam Books, 1989). Hampton and his company continued 
to produce a broad range of work, including a seven-hour examination 
of the Great Depression in 1993 and the five-hour series ``America's 
War on Poverty'' in 1995. His work was widely hailed by political 
and arts organizations; in 1990, Hampton received the Charles Frankel 
Prize from President Bush for being one of five Americans who made 
outstanding contributions to the humanities. After years of scraping 
for and charming his way into funding, Hampton received an $800,000 
grant in 1996 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The 
fruit of that money was ``I'll Make Me a World,'' about African-American 
artists in the 20th century, which is scheduled to be shown early 
next year. Hampton was born in St. Louis, where his father was a surgeon 
at the city's black hospital and his mother was a homemaker. He received 
a bachelor's degree in English at Washington University in St. Louis, 
and later received 14 honorary degrees from universities around the 
country. He is survived by two sisters, Viva Hampton Zimmerman and 
Judith Hampton, both of New York.
