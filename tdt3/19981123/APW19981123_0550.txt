Britain, the host of a meeting of 16 often-competing Iraqi opposition 
groups, said Monday it wants to help coordinate activities of the 
exiled opponents of President Saddam Hussein. ``It is almost impossible 
to argue that Iraq without Saddam Hussein would not be a better country,'' 
Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said after the meeting. ``A 
change of regime ... would have to better for the ordinary people 
of Iraq.'' British officials label the meeting the first of a series, 
reflecting the greater frankness by the United States and Britain 
that a prime aim in ending the stalemate over U.N. weapons inspections 
is to topple Saddam. The United States announced last week that it 
had held talks with Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, 
a London-based opposition group. The U.S. Congress also has approved 
a dlrs 97 million aid package to offer support to Iraqi dissidents. 
British officials said their focus is finding common ground among 
the opposition groups. ``If and when there is a change of regime in 
Iraq, it will be extremely useful to have the opposition groups working 
together so Baghdad does not fall into chaos and anarchy,'' Fatchett 
said before the meeting. In Damascus, the Iraqi Communist Party and 
another Syrian-based opposition group led by a former member of Saddam's 
Baath Party accused Britain of interfering. Fadel Ansari, once a senior 
Baath official who now leads a splinter pro-Syrian group in Damascus, 
said foreign intervention ``strengthens the regime and does not weaken 
it.'' London is a main center for Iraqi exile and opposition groups. 
At various times, the dissidents have succeeded in bringing together 
Shiite Muslim groups, former ruling party officials and Kurdish guerrillas 
who sought autonomy in northern Iraq. Opposition groups say they are 
a key source of information about Saddam and critical to any rebellion. 
One London-based group, The Iraqi National Accord, said this week 
that it has provided British authorities with a detailed list of Saddam's 
international spy network. The document, compiled by Saddam's private 
secretary, named all the members of Iraqi intelligence service who 
pose as diplomats and was released to the West even before it was 
on Saddam's desk, the group said in a report in London's Sunday Telegraph. 
``Information like this is priceless in the battle to end Saddam's 
tyranny,'' Ayad Alawi, who heads the group, told the newspaper, adding 
that Western support is vital. ``There is no point in the West urging 
Iraqis to overthrow Saddam if it is not prepared to help,'' he said. 
``The first step toward getting rid of Saddam is to persuade the Iraqi 
people that they have friends and supporters outside who can help 
them succeed.''
