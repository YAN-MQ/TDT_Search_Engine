The Turkish gunman who tried to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981 wasn't 
acting alone, a Kurd rebel leader claims in a letter made public Monday 
that seeks the pope's support for the Kurdish cause. The Vatican's 
only immediate response was that the Kurds and their opponents should 
solve their disputes peaceably. Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan wrote 
John Paul Nov. 18 while he was still in custody in Rome, La Repubblica 
daily said. A Rome court freed Ocalan two days later, rejecting a 
Turkish warrant for the guerrilla chief who is Turkey's most-wanted 
fugitive. Ocalan's letter blames two enemies of the Kurds _ Turkish 
nationalists and the Turkish military _ for the May 13, 1981, attack 
on the pope in St. Peter's Square. Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca 
shot the pope in the abdomen. He is now serving a life sentence in 
Italy. Agca was a member of the Gray Wolves, a far-right nationalist 
group that is the staunchest opponent to the Kurdish cause in Turkey. 
The motive for his attack on the pope has never been clear; Agca has 
gone back and forth on claims that the Bulgarian secret service plotted 
the attack at the instigation of the Soviet Union. Agca escaped from 
a Turkish jail in 1979, two years before the attack. Ocalan's letter 
claimed Agca actually was freed by one of the generals who later took 
part in Turkey's 1980 military coup. ``This hateful attack on your 
person should not be considered an individual act,'' Ocalan wrote, 
asking the pope's support for the Kurdish cause. ``Mr. Ali Agca has 
not told the truth.'' Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said 
Monday only that the church was mindful ``of the situation and the 
aspirations of the Kurds, who live as displaced people in many countries.'' 
The Holy had always advocated resolving the Kurdish issue ``through 
dialogue and discourse'' and has condemned ``any type of violence 
to resolve the problems,'' he said, according to the ANSA news agency. 
There was no immediate response to the letter from Turkey, which has 
always rejected peace talks with Ocalan's rebel Kurdistan Workers 
Party, or PKK. The PKK has fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy 
in Turkey's southeast that has killed 37,000 people. Ocalan insisted 
in his letter to the pope that he has now renounced ``armed struggle,'' 
but the fighting continues. Ocalan is seeking asylum in Italy; an 
Italian court ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give Germany 
time to decide whether to pursue extradition on its own terrorism 
charges. Italy's refusal to hand over Ocalan has outraged Turkey, 
its NATO partner. Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Turkey would 
make a formal extradition request Wednesday or Thursday, despite Italy's 
rejection of the Turkish arrest warrant. On Monday, a convoy of yellow 
taxi cabs careened past the Italian Embassy in Ankara, honking horns 
and flying banners declaring, ``No to Fiat'' _ although most of the 
cabs were Turkish-made Fiat 131s. Economy Minister Gunes Taner said 
in a newspaper interview published Monday that he disapproves of the 
popular movement to end trade with Italy. The government, he stressed, 
has not approved any boycotts.
