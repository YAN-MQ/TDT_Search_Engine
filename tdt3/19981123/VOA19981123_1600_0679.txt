Hundreds of international observers are arriving in Serbia's Kosovo 
province to monitor the shaky cease-fire between Serbian security 
forces and the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. But first, the observers 
will be going to school. Philip Smucker reports from a verifier's 
training school on Braziviza Mountain in Kosovo. International monitors 
will have just 5 days of training before taking on the dangerous job 
of monitoring Kosovo's guerrilla conflict. A school for monitors is 
being set up on Braziviza Mountain. The school, run by the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, will begin on Tuesday 
to teach the unarmed monitors how to work with the warring sides in 
Kosovo. The monitors, or verifiers, will learn how to deal with crisis 
situations. One such potential danger is the possibility of being 
taken hostage by the Serb forces or the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo 
Liberation Army. The school's director, Mario Regelli, says each hostage 
situation calls for a different reaction. Well I must check and ask 
my instructor. They're able to imagine the situation in particular. 
There is not actually an answer valid for all situations. The school's 
instructors, with experience in Bosnia, will tell the pupil verifiers 
not to overreact to any threat from either the Serbs of the Albanians. 
Italian police inspector David Piaianni says the main thing is not 
to get excited and talk too much. Well, mainly the main part about 
it is how to behave. It's do not react. Just stay very, very calm, 
very, very quiet. Do not overreact, not talk to these people. Listen 
to them, but do not do anything to agree or disagree to them. Just 
listen to them. Make the point yes, I do understand you have a problem, 
but I have not the power to solve the problem that it is. And wait 
because there will be somebody that will take care about the problem. 
The verifiers also will be taught how to mediate between the Serbs 
and Albanians in Kosovo. Their task is to keep the violence to a minimum 
and to help prepare Kosovo for elections in another 9 months. Philip 
Smucker for VOA News, on Braziviza Mountain.
