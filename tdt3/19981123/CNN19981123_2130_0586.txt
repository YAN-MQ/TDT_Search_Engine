New research suggests water shortages will pose the single greatest 
threat to food production and human health in the next 25 years. To 
combat this, a project, financed by the United States and Japan, has 
compiled a massive electronic water and climate atlas to improve the 
world's water management. The atlas provides maps of every country 
on earth and allows the user to call up a variety of information. 
The atlas is accessible on a set of compact discs and is scheduled 
to be available on the Internet next month.
