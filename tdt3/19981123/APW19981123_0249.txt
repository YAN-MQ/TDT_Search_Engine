Jewish settlers seized a West Bank hilltop on Monday as part of their 
campaign to gain control over more land ahead of the next Israeli 
troop pullback. In Monday's takeover, settlers of the Elon Moreh settlement 
drove a bus to a hill east of the community. The bus was used as a 
mobile home, with a generator providing electricity, said Peter Lerner, 
spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West Bank. The 
government considers the settler outpost illegal because it is outside 
the boundaries of Elon Moreh, Lerner said. It was not clear whether 
Israeli troops would order settlers to leave. Since the Oct. 23 signing 
of the Wye River peace agreement in Washington, settler groups have 
seized nearly a dozen hills to prevent the land from falling into 
Palestinian hands. Under the peace accord, Israel is to withdraw from 
13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in exchange for 
a Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants. Earlier this month, 
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon encouraged the settlers, saying 
they ``should move, should run, should grab more hills, expand the 
territory.''
