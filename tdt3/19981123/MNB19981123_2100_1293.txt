After a summer swoon, the Bulls are finally back on Wall Street today. 
The Dow surpassed its previous high set in July and closed at a new 
record high of 9374, up 214 points in heavy trading. Also strong gains 
in the NASDAQ. It closed at 1977, up nearly 50 points also in very 
heavy trading. With today's final push, the stock market has recovered 
the ground it lost in the late summer when turmoil overseas prompted 
fears of an economic downturn. Although the rally has been in progress 
for weeks, Ron Insana says news today of a couple of high-profile 
mergers took the market over the top.
