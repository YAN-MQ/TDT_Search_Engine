Following protests by feminists against lenient punishment for sexual 
assaults, an appeals court on Monday threw out suspended sentences 
for three men and sent them to jail. The defendants _ identified as 
Janusz W., 21, Grzegorz K., 18, and Seweryn D., 20 _ originally received 
two-year suspended sentences for abducting and sexually abusing a 
teenage girl. Under Monday's ruling, one received a 3 1-2-year sentence 
and the others received three-year sentences. Barbara Limanowska of 
the feminist group Oska welcomed the appellate ruling but said court 
sentences for rape were ``still too low.'' The case involved the abduction 
and beating of a teenage girl in July 1997 in a village near Opole, 
310 kilometers (190 miles) southwest of Warsaw. The three defendants 
were convicted of undressing the victim, beating her and wounding 
her face with a sharp object. They tried to rape the girl, who managed 
to escape. In June, a lower court sentenced them to two years in jail, 
suspended for five years because of their young ages and clean records. 
Womens' rights groups protested, saying the suspended sentences showed 
leniency for people charged with rape and sexual abuse. An open letter 
by the feminist groups later in June claimed more than one third of 
defendants convicted of rape got suspended sentences in 1996, compared 
to 25 percent who received suspended sentences in 1989. A new penal 
code, which took effect in September, lowered the possible sentence 
for rape to two to 12 years in prison, compared to three to 15 years 
under the old code. ``There is still an opinion that rape is not such 
a big crime,'' Limanowska said Monday. According to the Womens' Rights 
Center, two out of five Polish women are abused sexually sometime 
in their lives and only 20 percent of sexual crime is reported to 
police.
