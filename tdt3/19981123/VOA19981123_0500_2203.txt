Thousands of angry demonstrators took to the streets of Turkey's capital 
on Sunday protesting the freeing of Kurdish rebel leader Abdul Urjalon 
by Italian authorities. Amber Anzamon was there when the demonstration 
began at the Italian Embassy in Ankara. Thousands of men and women 
and children carrying Turkish flags and pictures of loved ones lost 
in the 14-year-long military campaign against the outlawed Kurdish 
Workers Party, or PKK, marched outside the Italian Embassy. They were 
chanting the same slogan: we want Apo. Apo is the nickname of PKK 
leader Abdullah Urjalon who was freed by an Italian court Friday after 
being detained for more than a week. Public anger has been steadily 
mounting here ever since the Italian government rejected Turkey's 
demands to hand over Urjalon on the grounds that he would be denied 
a fair trial in Turkey. Italy's constitution forbids capital punishment 
and Urjalon would face execution if found guilty in Turkey. In the 
Ankara demonstration was Rahan Azzizo, one of hundreds of mothers 
who lost their sons in the war against the PKK. Like so many tearful 
mothers here, Ms. Azzizo says the Italian government must return Urjalon 
to Turkey. She said she wants his blood in exchange for that of her 
son Murat who died in a PKK ambush last year. Relations between NATO 
allies Turkey and Italy have been steadily deteriorating ever since 
Urjalon stepped off a plane for Moscow 10 days ago and was detained 
by the Italian authorities in a Rome hospital. During a convention 
of his right-wing motherland party Saturday, Turkish Prime Minister 
Mezat Umat accused Italy of opening its arms to what he termed the 
world's bloodiest terrorist. Mr. Umat warned that Italy's behavior 
would not go unpunished. Nearly 40,000 people have died since the 
PKK launched its armed campaign for Kurdish self-rule in 1984. Amber 
Anzamon for VOA News, Ankara.
