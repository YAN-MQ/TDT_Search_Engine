Police searching the back lot of John Wayne gacy's mother's home say 
two suspicious spots have been located and excavation will begin immediately 
in areas not covered by a parking lot. A radar search on the grounds 
in Chicago was prompted by a group's claim new evidence gacy killed 
more, many more, than 33 young men and boys. Gacy was arrested and 
convicted in the 1970s and executed in 1994. The original 33 victims 
were buried in a crawl space beneath gacy's home. The new search was 
spurred by a private investigator who, decades after the fact, says 
he remembers seeing gacy with a shovel behind his mother's home. DNA 
tests could help identify any remains if they're found.
