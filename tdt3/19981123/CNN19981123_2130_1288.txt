Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports." After a disappointing finish to 
the 1998 season, the Atlanta Braves' restructuring continued today. 
The club signed free-agent outfielder Brian Jordan to a five-year 
$40 million deal. Jordan batted .316 last season with 25 home runs 
and 91 RBIs. It's gonna be a good mix because we have some great players 
here and all the guys can hit. So, it's gonna be a lot of fun.
