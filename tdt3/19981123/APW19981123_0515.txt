Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. announced Monday that it will launch a 
European subsidiary that will investigate and oversee media investments 
in continental Europe. Letizia Moratti, former chairman of the Italian 
broadcaster RAI, will serve as head of News Corp. Europe, to be based 
in Milan, Italy, Murdoch said at a news conference. He also confirmed 
that the new division is in advanced negotiations with Telecom Italia 
SpA and the French broadcasting group TF1 about launching joint broadcasting 
ventures. The talks with Telecom Italia concern the formation of a 
joint venture to develop the Italian pay-TV market, in which News 
Corp. would hold a minority stake, Murdoch said. The negotiations 
with TFI involve launching a channel targeted at the 15- to 35-year 
age group, to be distributed in France initially by cable and satellite, 
he said. Murdoch said that following the success of the BSkyB satellite 
station in Britain, in which News Corp. holds a major stake, ``we 
see opportunities to participate in media developments across Europe.'' 
``We are delighted to be working with Letizia Moratti, who has both 
the vision and experience to help us achieve our ambitions,'' Murdoch 
said. He said the new company was ``basically electronic'' and would 
not be expanding into the mainstream newspaper business. He did not 
rule out, however, moving into magazines or specialized publications.
