Seeking to keep the public focused on charges that President Clinton 
undermined the legal system, the House Judiciary Committee on Monday 
scheduled a public hearing for next week on the ``consequences of 
perjury and related crimes.'' Committee Republicans say they hope 
the session will underscore their view that the case is about serious 
legal issues, not simply the president's sexual dalliance with Monica 
Lewinsky. They said the probable witnesses for the Dec. 1 session 
include federal judges, convicted perjurers, and military personnel 
who could talk about the corrosive effects on the military code of 
honor of having a commander-in-chief who has admitted misleading the 
nation. Michelle Morgan, a spokeswoman for committee Republicans, 
said the witnesses would speak of the consequences of perjury on them 
``personally _ because convicted perjurers may have personal experiences 
they want to relate _ but also the broader consequences on the judicial 
system on the whole.'' The new hearing was scheduled as the committee 
at the center of the impeachment inquiry met in a private session 
to take a deposition from Daniel Gecker, the lawyer for Kathleen Willey, 
a former White House volunteer who has said that the president made 
a sexual advance to her. Gecker refused to comment to reporters as 
he left after three-and-a-half hours of questioning. Democrats assailed 
both Gecker's questioning and the newly scheduled hearing as diversions 
that drew attention from the fact that the committee, which heard 
from the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr last week, has yet to 
question any of the major witnesses who were relied on by Starr to 
build his case against the president. ``There hasn't been any testing 
of credibility,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., on the committee. 
``There hasn't been any testing of memories. There have not been any 
live witnesses.'' He called the hearing on perjury ``nothing but abject,'' 
saying ``We know what the law on perjury is.'' Delahunt said that 
if Clinton is not impeached, he could still be tried for perjury after 
he left office. ``Bill Clinton isn't above the law,'' he said. ``Bill 
Clinton can go to jail if he committed perjury just like someone in 
the military or a civilian or someone of any background.'' James Kennedy, 
a White House spokesman, derided the hearing on perjury as ``designed 
with more of a political partisan purpose than a constitutional one.'' 
Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, now hopes 
that his committee can complete its deliberations on the president 
during the week of Dec. 7. Republicans are predicting that the committee 
will approve on a party line vote at least one count of impeachment 
against the president for perjury. That would leave it up to the full 
House to decide whether Clinton should be impeached. Democrats are 
pushing instead for some kind of censure or rebuke of Clinton that 
would allow him to stay in office. With all but a handful of Democrats 
expected to oppose impeachment, moderate Republicans have become a 
closely watched group by the White House and conservatives who support 
impeachment because the moderates are likely to decide the outcome 
in the House. Officials said a number of the president's emissaries, 
including Bill Richardson, the energy secretary who is a former congressman 
from New Mexico, and Clinton's former chief-of-staff, Leon Panetta, 
who served for years as a House member from California, have been 
making calls in the past few weeks to sound out Republicans. On the 
other side of the issue, the conservative weekly newspaper, Human 
Events, in its latest issue, called on conservatives to telephone 
the Capitol and register their complaints with those Republicans whom 
it dubbed the ``GOP's pro-perjury caucus'' because they are leaning 
against impeachment. John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, 
paid a courtesy call Monday on Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., who 
is the incoming House speaker. Amy Weiss, a White House spokeswoman, 
said that Podesta raised the impeachment issue with Livingston at 
the end of their meeting when other aides had left the room. ``They 
had the briefest of conversations on impeachment and agreed it was 
a subject for members of Congress to decide,'' she said. However, 
Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Livingston, said ``Impeachment did not 
come up.'' In addition to questioning of Gecker, the Judiciary Committee 
also plans to take depositions next week from Bruce Lindsey, the deputy 
White House counsel; Robert Bennett, Clinton's personal lawyer in 
the sexual misconduct case brought by Paula Jones; and from Natahn 
Landow, a Maryland developer and Democratic fund-raiser close to the 
White House. Ms. Willey has said she had talked ``extensively'' to 
Landow about her encounter with the president. Landow, who has denied 
trying to influence Ms. Willey's testimony, invoked his Fifth Amendment 
right against self-incrimination when called by Starr before the Lewinsky 
grand jury.
