No, he has not sold the Mercedes. Kenny Anderson's fleet of eight 
automobiles remains intact _ four weeks after he was quoted in The 
New York Times saying, jokingly, that the financial strain of the 
National Basketball Association lockout might force him to part with 
one of his luxury rides. The cars are not targets of the repo man. 
Instead, they have come under siege from an angry public that can 
barely afford to see Anderson play. Columnists took their satirical 
shots, calling him a whiner. Talk-show callers who had barely heard 
of the New York schoolboy legend wanted to know what world he was 
living in. In his weekly HBO monologue, Chris Rock teased him, too. 
Poor Kenny, they said. He might have to do without tinted windows. 
When the hype finished escalating, Anderson, the Boston Celtics' 28-year-old 
point guard, had become the emblem of the disconnected, filthy-rich 
athlete. In the NBA, Kenny's cars had become Imelda's shoes. It would 
be hard to imagine Anderson as the same unassuming, slump-shouldered 
guy who handed out 400 free turkeys in a small room of an apartment 
complex in Rego Park, Queens, on Sunday. But there was Kenny Anderson, 
shaking hands, signing trading cards and dealing with old neighbors 
who said, ``Wow, I didn't know you had eight cars.'' ``They looked 
at the luxurious and materialistic things, but I don't think they 
looked at the financial picture,'' Anderson said of the article in 
The Times. ``I guess I found out, being in the business I'm in and 
dealing with the media, people are going to have their own opinions 
about everything.'' The turkey giveaway was not a lockout-inspired 
image boost. Hardly any news media knew about it, and only one photographer 
showed. The fact is, Anderson has been donating time and money to 
the community since he signed his first professional contract in 1992. 
He still owns an apartment in this modest complex, using it as his 
home away from home. The people who filed out of the apartment complex's 
basement with their Thanksgiving dinner bundled up in plastic did 
not hold him in awe as much as they did in esteem. ``This is so nice 
of you,'' said a hard-featured woman of maybe 50. Anderson thanked 
her for coming. Moments later, a teen-age boy approached Anderson 
with a trading card from when he played with the Charlotte Hornets. 
``You got another pen?'' Anderson asked, thinking that black felt 
tip might be better than ink. ``Oh, wait. This works.'' The kid smiled. 
When the article about Anderson's finances ran, I never expected him 
to become a target. The idea was to show where a $6 million salary 
goes and how an NBA player is not the average worker in a labor dispute. 
Few noticed his fledgling business, which provides work for friends 
from his old neighborhood, or the monthly mortgage payment for the 
house he bought for his mother. Instead, the focus was on the extravagances, 
the $75,000 a year in car insurance and maintenance and his personal 
monthly allowance _ $10,000 of what he called ``hanging-out money.'' 
What else do millionaires spend their money on? The backlash Anderson 
suffered made me wonder if I should have followed around an NBA owner 
to see how he spent his money. If the season ever does get under way, 
Anderson will be the victim of a few chants behind the bench. For 
a warped fan, it's plenty of ammunition. The day the article ran, 
union officials called Anderson's accountant, Scott Bercu, and lambasted 
him for saying, ``These guys have got to concede for a very simple 
reason: they're losing money every time they don't play a game.'' 
Said Anderson: ``I didn't hear anything personally from them, but 
I know a lot of people are thinking about it. I can't lose any sleep 
about that. You wrote the article. I didn't feel it was bad. I didn't 
feel it was great. But it was out there. ``What I found out is, people 
are going to have opinions about things and they might not be the 
same opinions that other people have.'' He contended that the numbers 
obtained from his accountant were skewed, but would not go into specifics. 
``I'm very smart with my money,'' he said. ``I know the value of a 
dollar and I know the value of my money. So I'm not going to be stupid 
enough to just spend it like crazy. ``But at the same time, I'm going 
to live my life. I'm on my second contract in the league. I came in 
the league making great money. That's when I bought all my cars. I 
had a car fetish. Now, in 1998, most of those cars are considered 
old. If I would've known what I know now, I probably wouldn't have 
that many cars. But that was my life. It's not as bad as it might 
seem.'' The turkeys were gone Sunday in 90 minutes, with word spreading 
quickly on 57th Avenue that the great point guard from Archbishop 
Molloy was handing them out along with his family and friends. Anderson, 
his mother, Joan, his sisters Danielle and Sandra and the volunteers 
Renee Harris, Al Blake and Loretta Henderson had made sure everyone 
went home with something. After the last turkey had been given out, 
the man with eight cars went upstairs to eat his mother's cooking 
and watch the Jets game. ``I took a lot of lumps in my career,'' he 
said, smiling. ``I don't feel like I took a lot of lumps for this, 
believe it or not. Some people don't even know of The New York Times. 
They don't even read The New York Times. I'm not knocking anybody. 
I mean, the corporate world probably reads it. But a lot of my friends 
who I deal with, they read the New York Post comics and look at the 
pictures.''
