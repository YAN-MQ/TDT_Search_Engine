When we come back, Dr. Kevorkian's crusade, question -- how many other 
doctors do roughly the same thg? It's no mystery why millions of people 
have moved... to the digital home entertainment of directv. - Ha-ha!pp- 
because directv gives them more movies, sports... and a Variety of 
programming they just can't get from cable. So what are you looking 
at? If it's not directv, see your retailer for a demo today. Some 
things can never be taught... in a Classroom. You won't find them 
in any textbook. And with fixodent's long-lasting hold... you'll be 
ready no matter where the lesson takes you. For long-lasting hold... 
my first boyfriend-- Rick whiting. I hadn't seen him in years. And 
we're at our 20th reunion catching up, and I get this terrible heartburn. 
But Rick hands me Zantac 75. "Thanks," I said. "So, did you ever become 
an accountant?" "No," he says, "A doctor." The medicine in Zantac 
75 is the #1 doctor-prescribed acid reducer. It relieves even your 
toughest heartburn, controlling acid for up to 12 hours. Dr. Rick 
whiting. Zantac 75 for tough heartburn.
