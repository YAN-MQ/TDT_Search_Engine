The French invented perfume because they had to. In the 17th century, 
even Louis XIV seldom bathed. In the late 20th century, 96 percent 
of the French live in homes equipped with showers or baths, even more 
than those with bidets. But only 47 percent bathe every day, according 
to a roundup of national surveys published in the daily Le Figaro 
last week, just before a cold wave began and probably drove the average 
down even further. Washing their dirty linen in public like this is 
something the French seem to do every two or three years. In the latest 
survey, only 60 percent of Frenchmen were found to change their underwear 
daily, the same percentage of all French people who said they regularly 
washed their hands after going to the toilet. This last figure led 
Bernard Pivot, host of a popular literary television program, to wonder 
publicly on Sunday about the wisdom of the French custom of shaking 
hands with co-workers at the start of the day. In particular, Pivot 
worried about what advice to give employees who faced the hazard of 
running into the boss just outside the office bathroom. Underlings 
not knowing what the hand that feeds them might just have touched, 
he suggested, would be best advised to forestall a handshake by picking 
up a voluminous file. Le Figaro assured readers that 85 percent of 
them said they washed their hands before meals. But 6 percent said 
they never washed them at all, perhaps explaining why the per-capita 
consumption of toilet soap in France was four to five bars a year, 
compared with a little more than twice as much in Germany and a lot 
more than twice as much in Britain. And even at that, Gerard Nirascou 
of Le Figaro wrote, people might be lying. Are Frenchmen lying when 
only 50 percent of them say they use deodorant? Unlikely, judging 
by recent experience in overheated rooms _ unless some are saying 
yes when they haven't. Le Figaro's scent survey drew on sources ranging 
from the Federation of Perfume Industries and the government-supported 
Health Education Committee to the Sofres public opinion polling organization. 
It led The Times of London to conclude in a headline, ``It's True: 
The French Really Are the Smelliest in Europe.''
