In Pittsburgh, the Steelers shut down the Jacksonville Jaguars 30-15 
to tighten their division race. Pittsburgh quarterback Cordell Stewart 
says the team needs to play that way every week. This is the way we 
expect to play week in and week out. We've made a commitment to ourselves 
and as a team that we have six games left, and depending on how we 
play in these last six games can determine everything else later on 
down the road, so we have to take it game by game and just understand 
that we control our own destiny. The Steelers trail Jacksonville by 
one game in the AFC Central.
