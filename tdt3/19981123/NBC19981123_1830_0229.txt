The economic signs are strong, but this market appears to be outrunning 
even the strong economy. So we've asked the market wizard from CNBC, 
Ron Insana, to join us again tonight to discuss the reasons for this 
long winning streak. ron? Well, Tom an interesting day as Mike pointed 
out. There was a lot of merger activity. Companies are growing for 
confident that by buying they'll be able to grow. $40 billion in announced 
mergers today. $1.4 trillion in mergers for the year. That's a record 
pace. On top of that, new technologies are providing a big boom. Internet 
stocks today, very hot. Some of them gaining as much as 30% in a single 
session. Amazon.com up as much as 30 points. As for the dough, Al 
cam pore ra reiterated that the Dow would claim, maybe just in time 
for Christmas. What about some of the Internet stocks? Are people 
investing in terms of real value? Well, many think back to radio or 
automobiles and stocks in those industries in the early 1900s performed 
much the same as Internet stocks are performing today. If you look 
at rca it went from 22 to 760. So industries can have big rides. This 
may just be the start of things. All right. Thanks very much. Ron 
Insana.
