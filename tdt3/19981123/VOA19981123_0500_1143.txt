The Denver Broncos improved to a perfect 11 and 0 with a 40-14 trouncing 
of the Oakland Raiders. Quarterback John Elway returned to action 
for the first time in 3 weeks and threw three touchdown passes. Elway 
became just the second quarterback to pass for more than 50,000 yards 
in a career. The other is Miami's Stan Moreno. All-pro running back 
Jerrell Davis rushed for 12 yards and a score in the Denver victory.
