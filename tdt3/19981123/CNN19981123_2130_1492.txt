If the thought of seeing another big-screen blockbuster leaves you 
dazed, try checking out one of the new arthouse films. Laurin Sydney 
looks at three. Kate capshaw plays a sexy siren on screen in the dark 
comedy "the alarmist." Did you miss me? Yeah. What are you doing? 
It was so honest and had the playful sex, the intense sex, sad sex, 
fun sex. They talked some, you know. Talking with capshaw in this 
whodunit were co-stars Stanley tucci, Mary McCormack and David Arquette. 
Tommy, say hello to miss brown. Hello, miss brown. Could he sit? Arquette 
admits that filming the sexually charged film was anything but romantic, 
due to some unusual props. You know, there's like girdles involved. 
I beg your pardon. No, not girdles. I didn't mean girdle. I mean, 
like, you know, vests, bulletproof underwear. Metal cups. It gives 
me great pleasure to welcome Britain's greatest living painter francis 
Baker. The artistic and personal life of one of the century's most 
famous painters is examined in the new film "love is the Devil." What 
I really want is for this film to introduce a new generation, maybe, 
to Baker, a wider audience to Baker's work. Derek Jacobi stars as 
the controversial British artist who died in 1992. In fact, he was 
so convincing -- One lady came up and threw her arms around me and 
burst into tears and called -- and said, "Francis, Francis." So that 
did my confidence a huge amount of good. Welcome. hi. It's nice to 
see you. a family gathering is at the center of "the celebration," 
the danish film that takes a darkly comic journey into forbidden territory. 
It is about a young guy, the son of the celebrated man, the father 
of the house, who stands up and makes a speech about his childhood. 
In front of 50 people, he reveals that he's been abused as a kid. 
If you're just going down the Alley, towards the darkness of this 
family, pretty quickly the audience will build a fence in front of 
them and feel bored. So if you make them laugh, they'll open up, and 
they'll be ready for another kick in the face. And the film was so 
well-received at the Cannes film festival, it's already given the 
director a kick in the career. Laurin Sydney, "CNN Entertainment News," 
New York.
