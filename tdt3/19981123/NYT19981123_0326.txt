It is the season of short, dark days, the time when the price drops 
for a weekend in Europe. If you have some uncommitted money and a 
valid passport, you can at least get a look at different scenery. 
And, on the subject of dark days, a recently reissued book, Fodor's 
World Weather Guide (by E.A. Pearce and C.G. Smith, Random House, 
$17.95 in paperback), gives an idea of how much light to expect in 
places where cheap travel packages are being sold. In Stockholm and 
London, December brings an average of one hour of sunshine daily, 
in Dublin and Paris, two. Madrid gets an average of five, like New 
York and Boston; Barcelona gets four. These long winter weekends overseas 
become available in November and continue at the same prices to the 
end of March. A period of almost a month around Christmas is either 
blacked out or carries a surcharge, because the airlines can fill 
up with better-paying passengers. For some British packages, there 
is also a higher-cost period around St. Patrick's Day. The packages 
expire before Easter and Passover. Here are some seasonal packages. 
Travel agents sell them; phone numbers are given for more information. 
Escapes to 13 Cities Swissair Vacations is offering a second season 
of European Escapes, this year to 13 cities, for three nights and 
four days. Berlin is cheapest, starting at $493 a person in double 
occupancy. The other are Amsterdam, starting at $537; Athens, $698; 
Brussels, $530; Budapest, $583; Geneva, $589; Nice, $542; Paris, $536; 
Prague, $580; Rome, $620; Salzburg, $589; Vienna, $589; and Zurich, 
$589. Breakfasts, hotel taxes and service charges are included. The 
prices are for a trip starting from Kennedy or Newark Airports, and 
do not include air taxes and charges that can total $53. For travel 
from Dec. 12 to 19, there is a surcharge of $120 a person to all cities 
except Salzburg, where it is $230. The packages continue to March 
31 although most are sold out between Dec. 20 and Jan. 4. Swissair 
is using three hotel chains in the middle range. The cheapest prices 
are for a room in a Best Western or, in Athens, a Minotel. Swiss Travel 
Invention Hotels are also used. A four-star hotel in Athens, the Esperia 
Palace, is $20 a night more. In mid-November, Paris, Zurich and Geneva 
were selling the fastest. The availability of hotel rooms, not airline 
seats, is the limiting element, according to Jackie Pash, a spokeswoman 
for Swissair. Swissair Vacations, Post Office Box 26028, Tampa, Fla. 
33623; (800) 273-8406. The ETM Travel Group in Westport, Conn., is 
offering what it calls weekend gems. Three-night packages from New 
York, Newark or Boston go to London, Dublin or Glasgow. The price 
is $499 a person, double occupancy. Virgin Atlantic, Aer Lingus and 
Continental are used. In London and Dublin, a city tour, breakfasts, 
service charges and hotel taxes are also included, but not airport 
transfers or $50 in airport taxes. In Glasgow, where the tour buses 
do not operate year round, according to Janine Callahan at ETM, a 
pub lunch with a pint of bitter and a drink of scotch, as well as 
airport transfers, are included instead of the city tour. The hotel 
in Glasgow at the basic price is the Stakis Ingram. In London, it 
is the Kensington Plaza; several hotels in the Stakis chain, including 
the St. Ermins, are available at a higher price. In Dublin, the basic 
hotel is the Stakis Dublin, but the Doyle Tara or Montrose, which 
are a way out from the city center, cost $479 a person. For those 
with six days to spend, this tour company provides three nights in 
London and three in Dublin at $799 under the same basic program. Allowing 
for surcharges around Christmas and St. Patrick's Day, these are available 
until March 31. ETM, 237 Post Rd. West, Westport, Conn. 06880; (800) 
992-7700. A Madrid or Barcelona weekend of three nights is priced 
at $499 a person with two in a room and with air fare from New York 
included (but not about $55 in airport taxes and fees). This promotion 
_ which has been selling fast _ is offered by Discover Spain Vacations, 
a service operated for Iberia by Central Holidays of Englewood Cliffs, 
N.J. The program was set up with daily departures from Nov. 1 to Dec. 
10, with a Sunday-night stay required. By mid-November, the only departure 
days left were for this coming week: Monday to Saturday, excluding 
Wednesday. Trips earlier in the week would require adding days, which 
are available up to a total of 30, for roughly $37 a person a night. 
Tourist-class three-star hotels are used, including the Rejina and 
Los Condes in Madrid and the Albeniz, Aragon and Gotico in Barcelona. 
Airport transfers in Spain, breakfasts and a city tour are provided. 
After a high-season gap until Jan. 10, similar programs will be available 
until mid-March, including six nights in the Costa del Sol in the 
south of Spain, where el sol shines on average for six to seven hours 
a day. Emilio Crespo, a spokesman for Central Holidays, expected the 
price would be about the same as before the blackout. Discover Spain, 
120 Sylvan Ave., Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 07632; (800) 227-5858. Bennett 
Tours of New York is packaging three nights and four days in three 
Scandinavian capitals with departures on Thursday and Friday evenings, 
returns on Mondays and Tuesdays. The last trip this year will be Dec.
