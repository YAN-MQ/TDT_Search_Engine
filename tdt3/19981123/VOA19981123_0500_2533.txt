Dariash Faruhar, an outspoken Iranian opposition leader, and his wife 
Parvani have been murdered in their home in Tehran. Iran's media announced 
the killings Sunday and said police are investigating. The couple 
was stabbed to death. The motive for the killings is unclear. Mr. 
Faruhar was an outspoken critic of Iran's Islamic Regime. He led the 
small nation's Party of Iran which calls for establishment of a secular 
democratic government and has supporters outside Iran. The nation's 
Party of Iran was tolerated by Iran's Islamic Regime, but hard-line 
militants had on several occasions attacked party meetings.
