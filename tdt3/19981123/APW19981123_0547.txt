Mobs burned vehicles and damaged a number of buildings in a continuing 
protest against a troubled pulp mill in North Sumatra after one of 
its guards shot and wounded a villager, news reports said Monday. 
At least 10 people were detained after several hundred villagers took 
to the streets Sunday and Monday in protest against PT. Inti Indorayon 
Utama in the district of Porsea, the official Antara news agency said. 
Some policemen and a number of employees were injured when they blocked 
stone-throwing villagers who tried unsuccessfully to burn the factory, 
Antara said. The villagers then burned an employees' dormitory and 
damaged shops, restaurants and houses in the town in North Tapanuli, 
about 1,500 kilometers (937 miles) northwest of Jakarta. They also 
burned a number of trucks and motorcycles. The newspaper Suara Pembaruan 
reported that the villagers had burned 13 trucks in the initial clash 
Sunday with workers of the company. It said that as four truckloads 
of workers were passing a volleyball court, a guard on one truck fired 
on a player picking up a volleyball on the street the trucks were 
using. Villagers and environmentalists have accused the company of 
pollution, and the provincial parliament has recommended that the 
government close it down.
