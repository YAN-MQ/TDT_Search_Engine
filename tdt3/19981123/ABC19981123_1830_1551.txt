Finally, "your money" and how the military can sometimes spend first. 
We're talking tax dollars how. We're talking in this specific case 
about the military communications systems and how expensive it can 
be to assume. Here's ABC's John Martin. At military trade shows, you 
hear lots of questions. How much band width are we using right now? 
But here's one the Pentagon often does not ask -- does this gear work 
in the countries where it plans to use it? Not always, say Pentagon 
auditors. They found $39 billion worth of U.S. weapons and equipment 
overseas that cannot be used. It's an operational crisis because these 
weapons systems will not perform as well as you want, because they 
can't use certain frequencies. Why aren't the frequencies available? 
Because Pentagon officials, who refused to talk to us on camera, never 
obtained permission from foreign countries to use them. Liftoff. That 
didn't stop the Pentagon. In one case it sent gear into space over 
a nation that, surprise, was already using the frequencies. These 
satellites, part of a Navy navigational system, do not work properly 
over Japan because the Japanese did not give them clearance. Cost 
-- $396 million. In Europe, the Pentagon wanted to fly this unmanned 
craft, but did not get frequency approval. Result -- $900 million 
worth of drones are on hold. The same for $7 billion in surveillance 
aircraft. Outh Korea, patriot missiles operate on the same frequency 
as local cell phones. The missile manufacturer says there's no problem 
but the agon inspector general says there is. If a patriot missile 
were overpowered by strong bursts of cell phone transmissions? The 
most likely thing it would do, it would, in effect, just jam the command 
and control signal and, in effect, disable the guidance system. The 
missile could go in any direction? It could go anywhere. Congress 
is just beginning to give the Pentagon some static about this. They 
need to be, using taxpayer dollars to buy equipment that they can 
use, and if they're not doing that. The system is broke. The senator 
wants hearings to clear the air, being on the wrong wavelength is 
wasting billions of dollars. It's "your money." John Martin, ABC News, 
Washington.
