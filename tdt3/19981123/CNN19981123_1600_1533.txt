Western Australia's state emblem may be headed for release from the 
endangered list. The numbat is getting help from a perth company and 
the local zoo. A medical center has donated money to help the breeding 
problems that face the tiny marsupial. Already this year, 17 numbats 
have been born in the perth zoo. Eight were born last year.
