the Minnesota Vikings have become the first team in the National Football 
League this season to clinch a playoff berth. The Vikings defeated 
the Green Bay Packers 28-14 for their 10th win in 11 games. They are 
now three games ahead of the Packers in the NFC Central Division. 
Packers coach Mike Homgren says it was a tough loss. There were a 
couple big plays that they made, you know, and they're going to make. 
I thought all in all the defense played -- our defense played pretty 
well, but, shoot, they're -- you know, just when you think you got 
it, one of those great players makes a play. The Vikings earned a 
playoff berth when the New Orleans Saints lost Sunday night to the 
San Francisco 49ers 31-20.
