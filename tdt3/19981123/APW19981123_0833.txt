Sports officials of Cameroon and FIFA president Joseph Blatter met 
Monday to try resolving problems that led to the dissolution last 
month of the Cameroon soccer federation. The world governing body 
of soccer, in a brief statement Monday, described talks in Zurich 
as ``frank and sincere.'' In addition to Blatter, Cameroon was represented 
by Joseph Owona, minister for Youth and Sport, and Maurice Tadjore, 
Director of Sports. FIFA said issues ``regarding football in Cameroon'' 
brought up in the meeting would be referred to its Dec. 3-4 executive 
committee meeting. FIFA dissolved the Cameroon federation earlier 
this month for a series financial problems and appointed an interim 
executive to run the organization for nine months. FIFA said Monday 
Cameroon would remain under the interim executive until further notice.
