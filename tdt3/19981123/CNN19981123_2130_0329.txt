It looks like the latest chapter in one of America's most notorious 
serial killing cases is closed. Jeff flock tells us what they didn't 
find at the former home of John Wayne gacy's mother. The barricades 
went up before dawn around a small brick apartment building in Chicago. 
Because -- Approximately 4 1/2 weeks ago the Chicago police department 
received information that indicated a location of potential victims 
of John Wayne gacy. An ex-Chicago police detective said he saw gacy 
outside the apartment in the middle of the night with a dirty shovel 
in 1975. That was three years before they began pulling bodies from 
gacy's crawlspace. Police arranged for a second radar scan of the 
property to determine if gacy could have buried more victims at the 
apartment where his mother lived in 1975. Radar scoping of the property 
has been completed. The data has been interpreted in the soft earth. 
The technicians have gone back to refine the parameters of what they 
are calling two suspicious spots. Inside a white tent they began digging 
on the suspicious area, just as they had 20 years before beneath gacy's 
house of death on the outskirts of Chicago, it just a few miles from 
the apartment building. As you can see, he had a pretty good recollection 
of where the bodies were. But this time, there was no hand-drawn map 
like the one gacy made for prosecutor Terry Sullivan 20 years ago. 
This time there were no bodies at all. Both of those soft earth sites 
have been excavated to conclusion and they are both to be found with 
Negative results. Nothing in the parking lot gacy paved in 1975 either. 
After all the mapping and digging, they found -- A glass marble, a 
flattened saucepan, a chunk of concrete and a two and a Half foot 
strip of wire. And so ends our story resembling not so much another 
chilling chapter in the history of John Wayne gacy as the excavation 
of Al capone's vaults. Still, those who know say based on what gacy 
was capable of, if there aren't more bodies here, there probably are 
somewhere. Jeff flock, CNN, Chicago.
