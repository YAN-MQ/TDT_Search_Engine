The special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan returned to 
Baghdad on Monday as Iraq unleashed a new volley of criticism at the 
chief U.N. weapons inspector's demands for arms-related documents. 
The papers sought by Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special 
Commission, are spurring a new confrontation between the government 
of Saddam Hussein and Butler's UNSCOM which oversees destruction of 
Iraq's most dangerous weapons. On Sunday, two leading Iraq officials 
derided Butler's request as a move to justify a U.S. military strike 
on Iraq, saying the government already had turned over all documents 
relevant to the arms inspectors' work. Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash 
Shah, flew in from the gulf state of Bahrain. He refused to comment 
about the latest controversy on arrival, saying only that he expected 
to meet with Iraqi officials. Monday's state-run Iraqi newspapers 
said a personal grudge against Iraq was behind Butler's new demand 
for documents. ``Butler has personal motives to create a new crisis,'' 
the daily Al-Thawra, newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, said in 
a front-page editorial signed by editor-in-chief Sami Mehdi. ``He 
(Butler) has explained Iraq's decision to let the inspectors resume 
their activities .... as a personal victory which he believes will 
enable him to take revenge on Iraq,'' the paper said. Iraq had asked 
for Butler's dismissal from UNSCOM as one of its demands for allowing 
U.N. weapons inspectors to return to work in the country. But it reversed 
its ban on the inspectors' work Nov. 14 when faced with a likely air 
strikes by U.S. and British forces in the Gulf. The arms inspectors 
returned last week and have been making visits to potential weapons-making 
sites daily, with the cooperation of the Iraq government. The inspectors 
must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction 
before the U.N. Security Council will lift sanctions imposed after 
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq insists it has already gotten 
rid of all proscribed weaponry. Butler's weekend demand for new documents 
again raises the prospect of possible American military strikes against 
Iraq since U.S. President Bill Clinton had demanded full cooperation 
with the U.N. weapons inspectors. In Korea, where Clinton was visiting, 
a spokesman for the National Security Council referred to Iraq's refusal 
to hand over documents as an ``insufficient'' response, but said no 
final conclusion had been made about the Iraqi move. The spokesman, 
David Leavy, raised the prospect of an attack, saying: ``If we conclude 
Iraq does not intend to live up to its commitments and UNSCOM can't 
do its job, we remain prepared'' to carry out air strikes Clinton 
canceled last week. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Sunday said 
Butler's demands were either intended to provoke an attack or to put 
off a promised Security Council review of Iraq's cooperation in arms 
destruction that the government hopes will lead to easing the sanctions.
