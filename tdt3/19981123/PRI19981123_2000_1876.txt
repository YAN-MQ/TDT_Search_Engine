Washington says it's trying to resolve the fight between its fellow 
NATO members, Italy and Turkey, over the fate of a Kurdish rebel leader 
being held in Rome. Italian prime minister Massimo D'Alema says Turkey 
should improve its human rights record before lecturing other countries 
on how to run their affairs. Along with a boycott of Italian goods, 
anti-Italian demonstrations have become a daily occurrence in Turkey, 
as Chris Morris reports from Ankara. Street protests against Italy 
have become a daily event in Ankara, Istanbul and other cities. Popular 
anger has often spilled over, with Italian clothes and Italian furniture 
being burnt by indignant crowds. At the same time, Turkey is immersed 
in a political crisis. A no confidence debate is now under way in 
parliament, which is expected to end with the downfall of the government 
in a vote on Wednesday. Chris Morris, BBC News, Ankara.
