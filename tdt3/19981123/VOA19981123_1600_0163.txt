The Indonesian capital, Jakarta, remained under heavy security Monday 
in the wake of anti-Christian riots that killed at least 13 people. 
Most Christian schools and some shops were closed one day after mobs 
of Muslim youths set fire to churches and attacked Christians in the 
streets. The violence erupted after a fight early Sunday between Christian 
and Muslim gangs. Indonesian President Vijay Habibi blamed the unrest 
on individuals who do not want political stability.
