A house committee has given the federal government a "D" for its overall 
efforts to correct the year 2000 bug. Rick Lockridge explains why 
in this edition of "tech trends." How you been doing, you been feeling 
all right? He's fine. But Medicare officials and a lot of other government 
types might feel distinctly unwell after seeing a congressional report 
card on the year 2000 computer problem. All of them cannot continue 
to act as though the problem is going to solve itself. Horn's technology 
subcommittee assigned letter grades to some 24 government agencies 
based on the agencies' own progress reports. He says the fact that 
there are still so many "Cs," "Ds" and "Fs," proves that the problem 
is more a lack of leadership than a lack of computer skills. It is 
a management problem, not just a technical problem. Only three government 
agencies earn "As" on horn's card -- the small business administration, 
the social security administration and the national science foundation. 
Among the laggards -- education, transportation, defense. Failing 
-- justice, energy, health and human services -- the agency that runs 
Medicare. Horn says some agencies, like the FAA, show signs of improvement 
but still have a lot of work to do before the public will feel confident 
about Y2K day. I told Mrs. garvey, the administrator, that I'd be 
happy to ride on a plane on January 1st, provided she was on it also. 
Some other agencies, such as the department of energy, draw horn's 
scorn. After all, who wants an "F" managing nuclear materials? The 
one agency many Americans probably wish would succumb to the bug is 
the IRS. But the agency is among a passing, if unimpressive, group, 
getting "Cs" and "ds." Only a couple of semesters left to bring those 
Cs and Ds up, for as horn, the Stern schoolmaster, says, the final 
exam will be pass/fail. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Washington.
