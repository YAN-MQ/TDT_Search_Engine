Creating a disability insurer that will dominate the business, UNUM 
Corp. and Provident Cos. agreed Monday to merge in a deal that valued 
Provident at $4.75 billion. ``This creates a real powerhouse,'' said 
Gloria Vogel, an independent insurance analyst for more than 20 years. 
While both companies portrayed the deal as a merger of equals, they 
said Provident stockholders would receive 0.73 share of the new company, 
based on UNUM's closing price on Friday of $48.125, for each Provident 
share. That puts the share price of Provident at $35.13, or $1.756 
over its price at the end of Friday. UNUM, based in Portland, Maine, 
has been the national giant in group disability insurance. Provident, 
of Chattanooga, Tenn., is the leader in individual disability insurance. 
Together they will be, by far, the largest in both categories. One 
strategy of the new company, to be called UNUM Provident, will be 
to try to sell individual disability insurance as a supplement to 
people who are already covered under group plans sold by UNUM. Typically, 
group disability insurance pays disabled people 60 percent of their 
salaries. UNUM also has been the leader in long-term care insurance, 
and the new company will offer that coverage to former Provident customers. 
``The combined company has the potential to provide genuine one-stop 
shopping for large corporations seeking disability coverage,'' said 
Eric Berg, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. ``But the threshold issue 
is: Will companies want to buy at one stop? My judgment is yes.'' 
In theory, at least, the sale of individual policies to people already 
in group plans should be an efficient practice. ``You get access to 
a clump of people rather than going to them one at a time,'' said 
Joan Zief of Goldman, Sachs. The new, more efficient company should 
be able to undercut the prices of competitors, she said. The stock 
market applauded the deal Monday, lifting the price of both companies. 
UNUM shares rose $4.50, or 9.4 percent, to $52.625 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, and Provident rose $4.125, or 12.4 percent, to $37.50, 
also on the Big Board. Until now, Provident has done business exclusively 
in the United States and Canada. With the merger, its products will 
be offered through UNUM's 20 overseas offices in places like Britain, 
Germany, France, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and Argentina. For the 
12 months ending on Sept. 30, UNUM reported $4.5 billion in revenue 
compared with $3.9 billion for Provident. UNUM's market value was 
$6.6 billion; Provident's, $4.5 billion. UNUM reported assets of $14.9 
billion; Provident, $23.3 billion. James Orr III, chief executive 
of UNUM, will become chairman and chief executive of the new company, 
and Provident's leader, Harold Chandler, is to become president and 
chief operating officer. On July 1, the two have agreed that Chandler 
will become the chief executive, and that Orr will remain as chairman. 
Eight UNUM board members and seven directors of Provident will make 
up the new board. Orr and Chandler said they expected to save up to 
$130 million as a result of the merger by combining some of the 105 
offices the two companies operate in the United States. They also 
plan to eliminate duplicate computer systems and to cut an unspecified 
number of jobs. ``Certainly, for the next year or two, we should have 
strong earnings from this new entity, just based on the expense savings,'' 
Ms. Zief said. Disability coverage is one of fastest-growing parts 
of the insurance industry. ``People have long recognized the risk 
of dying early or losing their home,'' said Vanessa Wilson, an analyst 
with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, ``but only recently have individuals 
focused on protecting their paycheck with disability insurance.'' 
And it is a business with lots of room to grow. Specialists in the 
field estimated that no more than 40 percent of corporate employees 
were now covered by disability policies, and even fewer in small companies.
