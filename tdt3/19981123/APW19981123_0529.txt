More than 1,000 teachers went on strike Monday demanding payment of 
back wages, forcing 9,000 children to miss classes, the Education 
Ministry said. The strike affected a total of 36 schools in the Crimea, 
Kirovohrad and Ternopil regions. Scattered strikes involving thousands 
of the country's 500,000 teachers began with the start of the school 
year Sept. 1. But wage debts only have mounted since then, reaching 
441 million hryvna (dlrs 129 million) as of last week, the ministry 
said. The former Soviet republic's government is struggling to collect 
taxes, pushing up its already huge wage debts.
