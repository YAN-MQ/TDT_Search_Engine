The Georgia Supreme Court has overturned the state's anti-sodomy law, 
saying it violates the Georgia constitution's guarantee of a right 
to privacy. The court voted six to one to overturn the sodomy conviction 
of Anthony powell, who was convicted of sodomizing his 17-year-old 
niece in 1996. Powell's lawyers had argued that the sex was consensual. 
The law had been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark decision 
in 1986.
