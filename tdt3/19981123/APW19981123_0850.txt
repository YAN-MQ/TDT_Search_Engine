Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading potential contender in Russia's 
2000 presidential election, will visit Germany and meet with Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder next month, in an apparent bid to raise Luzhkov's 
foreign profile. The mayor will tour Berlin, Munich, Bonn and Dusseldorf 
on Dec. 8-11, the Interfax news agency reported Monday, citing the 
mayor's office. Luzhkov, who is tremendously popular and powerful 
in Moscow but is little known outside the country, has clearly been 
trying to raise his foreign affairs profile ahead of the 2000 election. 
It also remains unclear how much support he can summon in Russia's 
impoverished provinces, which often resent Moscow's relative prosperity.
