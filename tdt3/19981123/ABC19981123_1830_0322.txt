There are also indications today that the settlement between 46 states 
and the tobacco companies was actually signed today. The tobacco companies 
didn't waste any time raising cigarette prices to help defer the cost, 
which is $206 billion. Philip Morris, the nation's biggest company, 
said it will raise prices by 4 r5 cents a pack. R.J. Reynolds is also 
raising prices and other big companies are expected to follow suit.
