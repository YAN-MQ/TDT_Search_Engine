Iraq says its refusal to hand over additional documents to U.N. weapons 
inspectors is not an act of noncooperation and calls the request unprofessional 
and provocative. Iraq says it might disclose relevant portions of 
documents in the presence of the U.N. envoy in Iraq. Prakash Shah 
arrived in Baghdad today. One of the papers in question is a document 
seen, but not given, to the u.N. team on July 18th. Meanwhile, inspectors 
continue their work around Baghdad. The United States says it still 
has enough military forces in place to strike at any time but stresses 
there are no plans to act immediately.
