the human rights group Amnesty International says Congo Kinshalsa's 
government and rebels are waging a brutal war against unarmed civilians. 
Amnesty says government soldiers, armed opposition fighters and ethnic 
groups allied to both sides have incited ethnic hatred and massacred 
thousands of civilians. Amnesty says the countries supplying arms 
to either side in Congo's conflict are also contributing to the poor 
human rights situation.
