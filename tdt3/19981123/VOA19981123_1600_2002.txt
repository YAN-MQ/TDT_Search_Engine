Israel has staged another air strike in southern Lebanon amid an escalating 
series of clashes with pro-Iranian Hezbellah guerillas. Reports from 
Lebanon say three Lebanese civilians were wounded in the attack. VOA's 
David Gollust reports from Jerusalem. An Israeli military statement 
said the aircraft struck at targets near the town of Nabatya along 
the edge of Israel's self-declared Lebanese security zone. It was 
the third air strike since Friday. It followed a clash with guerrillas 
earlier Monday in which one Israeli soldier was reported killed and 
two others wounded. The pro-Iranian Hezbellah has been waging a war 
of attrition in an effort to oust Israel and its militia allies from 
the security zone which Israel staked out in 1985 when it withdrew 
from the rest of southern Lebanon. A week ago, a roadside bomb claimed 
by Hezbellah killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded four others, 
the biggest Israeli casualty toll for any attack this year. Israel's 
government says it is ready to remove its troops from Lebanon provided 
it gets adequate security guarantees. It accuses Syria of blocking 
the process. David Gollust, VOA News, Jerusalem.
