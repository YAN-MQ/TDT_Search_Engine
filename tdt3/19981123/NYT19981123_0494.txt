Three European banks will finance the construction of a 455-room hotel 
to be built on top of an entertainment and retail complex in Times 
Square, state officials announced on Monday. The $120 million Doubletree 
Hotel is the seventh hotel planned for a once dismal neighborhood 
that has rapidly evolved into one of the most desirable commercial 
addresses in midtown Manhattan. A joint venture of the Forest City 
Ratner Cos. and the Promus Hotel Corp., the 25-story hotel will be 
built on top of a 25-screen AMC movie multiplex and a Madame Tussaud's 
wax museum that are now under construction, and will be priced to 
attract families as well as business travelers. The three banks _ 
Credit Lyonnais, Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank and Deutsche Bank 
_ will also finance the construction of the first hotel in Battery 
Park City in lower Manhattan, state officials said on Monday. That 
hotel, the $123 million 463-room Embassy Suites, will also be developed 
by Forest City Ratner and Promus and will be part of a project that 
includes a multiplex movie theater, a health club and a conference 
center. Both hotels are scheduled to be completed in 2000, said a 
spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner. The master plan for Times Square 
did not include the Doubletree Hotel, which will be located between 
41st and 42d Streets, close to Eighth Avenue, and will be less than 
a block from another new proposed hotel. The Tishman Urban Development 
Corp. is seeking financing to build a much larger hotel on the east 
side of Eighth Avenue between 42d and 43d Streets, adjacent to another 
entertainment and retail complex under construction. Charles Gargano, 
the chairman of the Empire State Redevelopment Corp., which is overseeing 
the development of Times Square, said the hotels would cater to different 
segments of the market. The 45-story Tishman project will have 900 
rooms and is intended to be more upscale. Richard Kielar, a Tishman 
spokesman, said his company never viewed the Ratner project as competition. 
Financing for the $230 million Tishman hotel is expected to be in 
place by next spring, he said. Speaking with reporters Monday, Gargano 
said the developers were not getting a tax reduction. But afterward, 
officials in his office said the state and city will help minimize 
the developers' risk by enabling them to defer as much as $1 million 
in taxes a year for the next 20 years if their profits do not meet 
expectations. But their taxes will increase if they exceed projections.
