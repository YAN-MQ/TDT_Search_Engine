Well, thank you very much, Victor. This is VOA News Now. I'm Les Carpenter, 
and my partner up here is Paul Westfieling. It's Universal time. From 
the dusty stacks of wax, we look at music news this week. American 
crooner Tony Bennett comes clean about past drug abuse. Country folk 
singer Mary Chapin Carpenter -- no relation to Les -- heads for the 
bright lights of Broadway. And imagine David Bowie and you, a songwriting 
duo. Sounds like a dream, but unfortunately, it could be a reality. 
VOA's Katherine Cull with details on these and other stories.
