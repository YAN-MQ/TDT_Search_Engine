Americans Ross Powers and Michelle Taggart won Monday's season-opening 
World Cup snowboard halfpipe runs. Strong winds forced organizers 
to cancel Sunday's races. Powers beat compatriot Zach Hoewitz, who 
finished in second place. France's Jonathan Collomb-Patton finished 
third in the men's halfpipe. In the women's halfpipe, American Kim 
Stacey and Doriane Vidal of France placed second and third respectively 
behind Taggart.
