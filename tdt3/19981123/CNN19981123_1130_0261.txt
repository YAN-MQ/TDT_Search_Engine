Iraq says it will answer U.N. security counsel questions about disputed 
documents sometime today. U.N. inspectors want the documents to put 
together a history of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs. 
Iraqi officials say the documents have already been turned over or 
no longer exist. They say chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler 
is making the request in order to justify a U.S. military strike. 
A U.S. national security council spokesman says military action is 
possible if Iraq does not live up to its commitments.
