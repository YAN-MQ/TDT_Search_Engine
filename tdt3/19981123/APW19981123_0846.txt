German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his environment minister told 
a meeting of tourist experts Monday in Bonn that they intend to push 
for a Europe-wide aircraft fuel tax. Schroeder told the gathering 
that while Germany would not implement such a tax on its own, the 
exemption of tax for some users of kerosene was ``ecologically unacceptable,'' 
and distorted competition between transport systems. Kerosene for 
trucks and other vehicles in Germany is taxed. Environment Minister 
Juergen Trittin said that not taxing fuel for the flying industry 
``the most energy intensive form of travel,'' was an indirect state 
subsidy that amounted to about 6 billion marks (dlrs 3.5 billion)'' 
a year. Aircraft fuel has remained exempt from tax in Germany, despite 
various attempts over the years to impose one.
