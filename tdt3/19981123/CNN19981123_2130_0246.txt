Computer users are awaiting word of a $4 billion merger between America 
online and Netscape. The companies still are negotiating. With 14 
million subscribers, AOL is the largest Internet provider in the world. 
Netscape develops Internet software, such as browsers, that allow 
people to navigate the world wide web. Also involved in the deal is 
sun Microsystems, another computer industry giant. AOL says if the 
deal goes through sun would be involved in the development and marketing 
of Netscape products. Speculation about the possible merger helped 
boost the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high. That tops 
the previous record set on July 17th.
