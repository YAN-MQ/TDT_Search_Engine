An appeals court Monday ordered a Saskatchewan farmer to serve at 
least 10 years in prison for killing his severely disabled daughter, 
overturning a lenient sentence issued by a judge who said the father 
acted out of love. The ruling against Robert Latimer was the latest 
twist in an five-year case that has fueled divisive public debate 
over the ethics of mercy killing. Latimer was convicted last year 
of second-degree murder for the 1993 killing of his 12-year-old daughter, 
Tracy, who suffered from severe cerebral palsy. The judge in the murder 
trial provoked a national furor by refusing to impose the mandatory 
life sentence with no chance of parole for 10 years. Instead, invoking 
a rarely used exemption, he sentenced Latimer to serve one year in 
a provincial jail and a second year confined to his farm. On Monday, 
Saskatchewan's Court of Appeal upheld a prosecution appeal and ruled 
that the trial judge erred by refusing to impose the mandatory sentence. 
Latimer told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. he was disappointed by 
the ruling but preferred a long jail term to the alternative of watching 
Tracy suffer indefinitely. It was not immediately clear if Latimer 
would be allowed to remain free while his lawyer considers a possible 
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Latimer, who has three other 
children, admitted to killing Tracy by placing her in his pickup truck 
at the family farm and pumping carbon monoxide into the cab. Tracy 
had suffered from a severe form of cerebral palsy that left her unable 
to walk, talk or feed herself. The girl had endured operations on 
her back, hips and legs, and her parents believed she faced the prospect 
of a lifetime of painful surgery. After convicting Latimer last year, 
jurors told the trial judge, Ted Noble, they felt the mandatory sentence 
was too harsh and recommended Latimer be paroled after one year. Noble 
agreed with the jurors, saying the mandatory sentence would in this 
case be cruel and unusual punishment. ``The evidence establishes Mr. 
Latimer was motivated solely by his love and compassion for Tracy 
and the need _ at least in his mind _ that she should not suffer any 
more pain,'' Noble ruled. Activists for the disabled were infuriated 
by Noble's ruling, saying it sent a signal that the disabled have 
less of a right to life than other people. Latimer was first convicted 
in the case in 1994, but the Supreme Court threw out that conviction 
because some jurors had been improperly questioned by police.
