More than two decades after his arrest and four years after his execution, 
serial killer John Wayne Gacy again captured the attention of this 
city Monday as the Police Department dug up the yard of an apartment 
building where they believed more of his victims may have been buried. 
But after an afternoon digging around the fenced-in yard, detectives 
emerged with the news that they had found a marble, a saucepan, a 
slab of concrete _ but no bodies. Police arrived before dawn to cordon 
off the block around the house, and later erected a tent to obstruct 
the view of circling news helicopters and of cameras on nearby roofs. 
``Based on the evidence we had, we had no choice but to dig,'' said 
Officer Pat Camden, a department spokesman. ``We had an obligation 
not only to the community, but to anyone who has missing kids out 
there.'' Police received information several weeks ago from a citizens' 
watchdog organization called the Better Government Association that 
bodies may have been buried at the site, a three-story apartment building 
on the city's northwest side where Gacy's mother once lived. Terry 
Brunner, the organization's director, said it had received a tip from 
a Police Department detective, no longer with the force, who claimed 
to have seen Gacy outside the building in 1975 with a shovel in the 
early hours of the morning. The watchdog group decided to check the 
site with a new radar technology scanner that can penetrate the ground. 
When the results indicated the potential existence of human bones 
under the yard and an asphalt parking lot adjacent to the building, 
the group contacted the police. Using the same Dutch-made scanner, 
the police department scanned both areas Monday and then had workers 
dig two four-feet deep holes. Terry Sullivan, a prosecutor in the 
Gacy case 20 years ago, said it would not have surprised him if police 
had found bodies. ``There's not reason to believe Gacy didn't kill 
100 people,'' Sullivan said. Gacy was arrested in 1978 after what 
is believed to be a six-year period in which he lured young boys and 
men to his home and killed them. After the arrest of Gacy, a building 
contractor and part-time clown, the police found 29 bodies buried 
below or near his house outside Chicago. Four more were found in a 
nearby river. Gacy was executed in 1994. After Monday's search, the 
police announced that the Gacy investigation was again at an end. 
``We are done,'' said Cmdr. John Thomas. ``This part of the investigation 
is now closed.''
