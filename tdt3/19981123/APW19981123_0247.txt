Commuter and long-distance train services were reduced in Spain Monday 
by the European railway strike, but the state railway company said 
there had been little noticeable effect on morning trains. Trains 
were running on schedule, the RENFE railway company said. The company 
said it cut in half the number of trains running on the long-distance 
routes and three out of four commuter trains were in service during 
morning and evening rush hours. No incidents were reported. Unions, 
fearing job losses resulting from plans to further privatize European 
railways, had called for strikes in Spain, France, Belgium, Portugal, 
Greece and Luxembourg.
