Prosecutors in Michigan say a "60 minutes" segment on Dr. Jack Kevorkian 
appeared to show the retired pathologist committing a homicide. Still, 
they say they will conduct a full investigation before deciding whether 
to charge Kevorkian in the death of Thomas yauck. The segment last 
night showed Kevorkian giving a fatal injection to the man who had 
Lou Gehrig's disease. Prosecutors have subpoenaed 60 minutes for an 
unedited copy of the videotape. In the past, Kevorkian assisted others 
in administering lethal injections. He called youk's deaths his first 
euthenasia and he's challenging prosecutors to charge him. The prosecutor 
says this is all a publicity stunt. I can state that I find Kevorkian's 
attempt to challenge the statute prohibiting assisted suicide in the 
state of Michigan to be a disingenuous, media ploy to garner publicity 
for himself, at the expense of Mr. youk and his family. This office, 
however, will not be baited into making a premature charging decision. 
A complete and thorough investigation's being conducted by the Waterford 
township police department. Kevorkian says he has helped about 120 
people commit suicide. He says if he is ever convicted, he will starve 
to death in prison.
