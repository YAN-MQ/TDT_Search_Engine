Iraq's resistance to turning over documents about its arms programs 
shows it is not complying fully with its own promise to resume cooperation 
with inspectors, Britain's U.N. ambassador said Monday. As a result, 
a promised Security Council review of Baghdad's seven-year effort 
to disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction remains ``in the future,'' 
Jeremy Greenstock said. Baghdad has pinned its hopes on a lifting 
of the eight-year U.N. oil embargo to the review, which the council 
agreed to as a way to persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with the 
U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for disarming Iraq. 
Iraq ended that cooperation first in August and then more completely 
on Oct. 31 _ a day after the council released a preliminary outline 
for the review that didn't specifically refer to a lifting of the 
embargo as a possible result. Baghdad reversed its decisions on Nov. 
14, pledging unconditional cooperation with UNSCOM and narrowly averting 
what U.S. officials have said were imminent airstrikes. Greenstock 
spoke to reporters as council members met for the first time since 
Iraq balked Friday at a U.N. request for documents related to its 
missiles and chemical and biological weapons programs. U.N. weapons 
experts must certify that those weapons, as well as nuclear arms, 
are destroyed before the council will lift sanctions imposed after 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf war. The council president 
was meeting with Iraq's ambassador later Monday, U.N. officials said.
