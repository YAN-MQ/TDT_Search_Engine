It looks as if the old days are back. The heady mergers-and-acquisitions 
wave that crashed in August has returned in full force, with nine 
combinations worth $40.4 billion either announced or under negotiation 
Monday. While that is less than half the $90 billion price tag put 
on two bank deals in one day last April, it is a record all its own: 
On no other day have so many deals valued at $1 billion or more been 
announced, according to Securities Data Co. But there were several 
factors on Monday _ a day, as well, of surging stock prices _ that 
distinguished it from all the busiest days that have preceded it this 
year. Deals are crossing many industry lines _ a departure from the 
bank-and-telecommunication-heavy combinations earlier this year. And 
executives are more eager than ever to find partners abroad. Witness 
Deutsche Bank AG's potential acquisition of Bankers Trust, which is 
expected to be one of several purchases of U.S. companies by foreign 
businesses in the coming year. Europe, too, is expected to see a major 
boom in merger activity, although not quickly. There are still significant 
obstacles, such as the tax and accounting rules that vary from country 
to country, as well as likely opposition from labor unions unused 
to American-style corporate layoffs. And in the short term, there 
are sure to be clashes as companies are compared with their peers 
in other countries, something that has not been the practice in Europe. 
``That sets up a dynamic that you'd better run your company better 
or get taken over,'' said Richard Sapp, head of the European mergers-and-acquisitions 
department at Goldman Sachs International. ``And if you lose your 
job, are you likely to move from Germany to France? That would be 
difficult.'' Just as important, there has been a shift in the mind-set 
in corporate boardrooms since late summer. Executives who retreated 
after financial turmoil in Russia and in much of Asia ravaged stocks 
at home have become bolder and are ready to conduct business as usual. 
``The strategic objectives did not change one iota,'' said Gary Parr, 
head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, whose 
firm advised five of the companies that made announcements Monday, 
including those at Bankers Trust, Netscape Communications and UNUM 
Corp. ``A lot of deals were waiting to be done when the market stabilized. 
Now that markets have bounced back nicely, managements feel comfortable 
and are willing to move forward.'' The fundamental reasons to merge 
_ competitive advantage _ have not changed. Take for instance, the 
proposed combination of Netscape and America Online, which could also 
include a joint marketing agreement between America Online and Sun 
Microsystems. In all, the complex combination is meant to strengthen 
these companies' positions against Microsoft, which is at the center 
of a landmark government antitrust suit. And bank and insurance mergers, 
which have been most pronounced this year, are likely to continue 
for the short term despite concerns about possible disruptions to 
computer systems in the year 2000. ``I don't think computer issues 
are going to make a difference for deals that are compelling,'' said 
Rodgin Cohen, a banking lawyer with Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, who specializes 
in mergers advice. And he warns that deals are less likely to be a 
reaction to other mergers, despite what the timing may suggest. ``Would 
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. and Norwest Corp. have merged if Nationsbank 
and BankAmerica hadn't gotten together?'' he asked. ``Absolutely.''
