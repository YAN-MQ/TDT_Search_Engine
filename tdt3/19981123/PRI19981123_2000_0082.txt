Webster Hubbell, former law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton, pleaded 
not guilty today to cover-up charges by Whitewater independent counsel 
Kenneth Starr. A federal grand jury working with Starr's office indicted 
Hubbell on 15 felony counts stemming from the collapse of an Arkansas 
land deal in the 1980s. NPR's Peter Overby reports. Hubbell is a long-time 
friend of the Clintons. The indictment alleges that he committed perjury 
and fraud and obstructed two agencies investigating the real estate 
deal. The indictment refers repeatedly, but not by name, to Hillary 
Clinton, who was a lawyer involved in the development. The Clintons 
brought Hubbell to Washington in 1993. He became the third-ranking 
official at the Justice Department. But a year later, he pleaded guilty 
and went to prison for 18 months on other Whitewater-related charges. 
And Starr is asking an appeals court to reinstate yet another indictment 
alleging that Hubbell evaded taxes. Hubbell says Starr is squeezing 
him to testify against the Clintons when he has no incriminating information.
