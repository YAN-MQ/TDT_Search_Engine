Dozens of judicial police, many wearing ski masks and armed with automatic 
rifles, raided a Mexico City police station Monday and arrested about 
100 police officers. A police official, Ramon David Almada, said the 
arrested officers were being charged with ``serious crimes,'' including 
possible homicide, but declined to elaborate. The arrested officers 
were members of the auxiliary police force, which performs most day-to-day 
police functions such as patrolling. The raid was carried out by more 
than 100 members of Mexico City's judicial police, who investigate 
most crimes and serve most arrest warrants in the city. Mexican television 
and radio provided live broadcasts of the raid.
