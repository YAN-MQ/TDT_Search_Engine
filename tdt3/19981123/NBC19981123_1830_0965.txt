Back in 1993, Carol poenisch supported her mother's decision to die, 
a Suicide carried out with the help of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. In fact, 
she says Kevorkian was understanding and compassionate. But now, after 
watching his latest case on television, she has a very different view. 
Tonight, Carol poenisch, "in her own words." To see my mother living 
the way she was and with this terrible disease, we were fighting for 
breaths. We were fighting for life. We were fighting constantly. It 
was weary. She had no time to enjoy life. She'd reached the end of 
her rope and she was ready and very sure of her decision. I don't 
think doctors should be recommending this procedure. I don't think 
it should be part of a pro to Cal. I think it should only come about 
when a patient has made repeated requests and when certain safeguards 
and requirements have been met. He did cross a line. He did use active 
euthanasia. He injected the patient with a lethal dose and I feel 
that is something only the patient should do. I would tell him, "you've 
gone too far. I'm very thankful for what you did for my mother. And 
I cherish you as an individual. You understood my mother's pain more 
than anyone could have or did and you were there at a time when we 
really needed you. But this is not the direction we need to go. Carol 
poenisch tonight, "in her own words."
