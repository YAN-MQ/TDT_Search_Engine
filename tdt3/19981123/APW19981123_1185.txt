Race leader Colin McRae dropped out of the Network Q rally of Britain 
with mechanical trouble Monday while Carlos Sainz remained on course 
for his third world title by staying in a top four position despite 
a blunder just before the end of the second day. McRae, a former world 
champion in his last race for Subaru before he transfers to Ford, 
was leading the field on stage 20 of the 28-stage rally, when his 
engine blew on the way a Builth Wells in Wales and he handed the lead 
to fellow Briton Richard Burns in a Mitsubishi. ``The engine's knackered, 
it's finished,'' said the Scot who was bidding to win the race the 
fourth time. ``It's the end of a bad season.'' Although he was out 
of contention for the world title, McRae had led virtually from the 
start of the race round England and Wales which finishes at Cheltenham 
on Tuesday. By then, Sainz hopes to be crowned world champion. The 
Spaniard came into the last race of the season two points behind championship 
leader Tommi Makinen. But the Finn slid out of the race on Sunday 
when he skidded on a patch of oil and the impact with a concrete pillar 
smashed a rear wheel. Sainz, who now only has to finish in the top 
four to clinch his third title but first for six years, was third 
after 19 stages before McRae's retirement. He slipped back to fourth 
at the end of the second day's racing and has to keep or improve on 
that on day three. But he almost ran out of the race on the 20th stage. 
Instead of taking a high-speed left turn at a junction, the Spaniard 
carried straight on and was lucky that an exit road allowed him to 
turn back and continue. If the exit road had not been there, Makinen 
would now be champion for the third successive year, while Sainz lost 
50 seconds anyway. Going into the final day's racing around south 
Wales and south-west England, Burns leads McRae's brother, Alister, 
by 1 minute 15.7 seconds with Finland's Juha Kankkunen third and Sainz 
fourth, 2 minutes 01.7 behind the leader. ``The pressure is very strong,'' 
Sainz said. ``I cannot afford to relax or make a mistake. ``We lost 
time on the last two stages but everything is alright. The battle 
will go all the way to the finish tomorrow. We can take nothing for 
granted.''
