Disturbed by a fire in the night, a kitten raced around frantically, 
waking up a family and saving it from the raging flames. But 3-month-old 
Topi was unable to escape the flames himself, the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper 
reported Monday. ``Without Topi, we would've been engulfed by the 
flames,'' said Heikki Tahvanainen, who narrowly escaped with his wife 
and 18-month-old son. Tahvanainen woke to a loud sound at 2 a.m. on 
Sunday, and found Topi leaping about in the room next door. Then he 
saw a strange glow under the kitchen door. ``I realized the house 
was on fire, and woke up the others. We just had time to put on our 
pants,'' Tahvainen said. Topi likely hid in some corner and perished 
in the flames, Tahvanainen told Ilta-Sanomat. The family had no chance 
of saving it, he added. The fire destroyed the wooden house in Pyhaselka, 
430 kilometers (265 miles) northwest of Helsinki.
