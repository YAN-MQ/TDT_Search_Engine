At the National Book Awards ceremony on Wednesday, all bets for the 
Fiction Award were on ``A Man in Full,'' Thomas Wolfe's flamboyant 
novel weighing in at 742 pages, full of larger-than-life characters. 
In case Wolfe won, his publisher, Roger Straus, the president and 
chief executive of Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, was ready to read 
Wolfe's acceptance remarks for him. Wolfe was in Atlanta. But instead 
the prize went to a novel 280 pages long that ``cared nothing for 
horsepower, only for stealth,'' said Thomas Mallon, chairman of the 
judges' panel in announcing the prize. The book was ``Charming Billy,'' 
by Alice McDermott, a quiet, unpretentious story of quiet, unpretentious 
people, Irish Catholics in New York for whom religious faith is a 
given. Ms. McDermott, whose book was also published by Straus, was 
expecting nothing. Her book ``That Night'' had been nominated in 1987 
and did not win. She had other priorities: three children _ Will 13, 
Eames, 10, and Patrick, 5 _ and her writing students at Johns Hopkins 
University, who needed recommendations. ``I was surprised this time, 
and very pleased,'' Ms. McDermott said in typically modest fashion. 
``Charming Billy'' is about Billy, who in his youth fell in love with 
an Irish girl. The girl returns to Ireland; he works to bring her 
to the United States so he can marry her, and he sends her money. 
But then he is told that she has died. Billy spends his life in bars, 
mourning. ``Dark, sparkling, sprinkled with moments when the sound 
and smell and sight of the place,'' Ms. McDermott writes, ``the taste 
at the back of his throat, transported him, however briefly, to a 
summer night long ago when he was young and life was all promise and 
she was there to turn to.'' He marries plain Maeve, who carries him 
drunk to bed every night. One day Billy learns that the Irish girl 
didn't die after all. She had taken his money, married and opened 
a gas station with her husband. ``Billy is in every extended Irish 
American family,'' Ms. McDermott said. ``He's the lovable drunk. It's 
not a party or a family gathering unless he's there.'' Ms. McDermott 
was interested in ``the persistence of the love that families and 
friends have for these people. It's probably wrong-headed. Smart, 
modern people would say you're enablers.'' Ms. McDermott, 45, drew 
partly on the Irish Catholic culture of her extended family to write 
the book. Her parents moved from New York City to Long Island, N.Y., 
when Ms. McDermott was an infant. Ms. McDermott's father was a business 
representative for Con Edison, the utility. Her parents were not college 
educated, but her father had had a Catholic education. He would emote 
``The Charge of the Light Brigade,'' she said. ``He would quote favorite 
lines from Shakespeare.'' Her mother encouraged her to write when 
something troubled her. Another influence, she said, was ``the Latin 
Mass, the rhythm of the language of prayer and ritual, the importance 
of repetition.'' Ms. McDermott went to parochial school, where, she 
said, she was a feckless teen-ager, ``sneaking into bars with fake 
IDs at 16 and 17, probably drinking too much on weekends and getting 
in all the wrong cars.'' For college, she chose the State University 
of New York at Oswego, ``because it was a great party school.'' But 
she fell under the influence of her writing teacher, Dr. Paul Briand. 
``I got bad news for you kid, you're a writer,'' Briand told her. 
Still, she drifted. After college, she worked in New York at Vantage 
Press, a vanity publisher. She won a scholarship to the writing program 
at the University of New Hampshire and came under the influence of 
another mentor, Mark Smith, who told her, she said: ``I'm taking you 
seriously. You have to take yourself seriously.'' She got serious 
and sold a story to Ms. magazine, then another to Seventeen. She also 
met her future husband, David Armstrong, ``a Midwestern WASP,'' she 
said, at the Mad Hatter, a singles bar in New York. Armstrong is a 
neuroscientist. After her marriage, she began a novel about a girl 
working at a vanity press. Her mentor, Smith, wrote to his agent, 
Harriet Wasserman, saying, ``You're going to kiss my feet in Macy's 
window for the writer I'm going to send you.'' Ms. McDermott showed 
Ms. Wasserman some pages, and a week later, Jonathan Galassi, then 
at Houghton Mifflin, offered her a contract. At first she was very 
diffident, Galassi said, but in her writing, he added, ``She's controlling 
what's going on, and very, very powerfully.'' ``A Bigamist's Daughter'' 
(Random House) was published in 1982, and reviewed on the front page 
of The New York Times Book Review by Anne Tyler, who said that Ms. 
McDermott ``writes with assurance and skill, and has created a fascinatingly 
prismatic story.'' In 1987, Ms. McDermott published ``That Night'' 
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), about a teen-age romance in suburbia. 
David Leavitt praised it on the front page of the Book Review, for 
``its sense of almost Shakespearean tragedy.'' Galassi, reading the 
review to her over the phone, ``started to cry,'' Ms. McDermott said. 
``That Night'' was later made into a movie starring Juliette Lewis. 
``At Weddings and Wakes'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux) came in 1992. 
She calls it ``my Irish-American novel.'' It's about five Irish Catholic 
women, one of whom, an ex-nun, is courted by a mailman. She marries 
him, and dies four days later. That book made the New York Times best-seller 
list. Despite the praise, writing is difficult for Ms. McDermott. 
One method of foiling her terror, she said, is to work on two novels 
at once. If one isn't working, ``I can have the courage to dump it.'' 
She began ``Charming Billy'' in 1995, as usual showing Galassi sections 
of it, asking his opinion. On the surface a simple book, it is in 
fact technically complex, weaving between past and present, told from 
several points of view, sometimes told from inside the heads of characters, 
at others by an omniscient narrator. The main narrator is a young 
woman. Ms. McDermott was determined to have her. ``There aren't enough 
smart women's voices in fiction,'' Ms. McDermott said. Too often it 
is a male narrator who tells the truth of things. She wanted ``a woman's 
voice that is not deluded, not mistaken, not self-obsessed.'' ``This 
is the woman's role in a family,'' Ms. McDermott said, ``to put the 
histories together.'' Ms. McDermott lives in a large brick house in 
Bethesda. She calls herself a practicing Catholic whose faith has 
deepened. ``I'm doomed to be a Catholic,'' she said, with a laugh. 
``There's no turning back.'' She works from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. while 
her children are at school. She is, as usual, writing two novels, 
one too new to talk about. ``The other one is about women, almost 
exclusively,'' she said. ``I still think there's a lot of material 
in the experience of women not fully tapped and appreciated.'' Women, 
she said, are ``the people who take care of the old people and the 
young.'' They keep the domestic world moving. The novel is about motherhood, 
``about women's lives from beginning to end.''
