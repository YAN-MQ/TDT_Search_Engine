Also in Washington tonight, the FBI has now released the latest round 
of numbers on violent crime in this country. And once again, the statistics 
are going down. But that certainly does not mean the problem is a 
thing of the past. Here's NBC's Jim Avila. Duarte, California, early 
this morning. A convenience store clerk is shot to death during a 
robbery, evidence that america is still the most violent industrialized 
country on earth. But the FBI crime report released today shows six 
years of falling crime rates -- evidence that despite the violence, 
America is now safer than it has been in 30 years. The FBI decline 
certainly says the nation is safer. Overall crime is down a full 10% 
over the last five years. And the most important number, murder, is 
down 26% -- the lowest murder rate since 1967. It's improved the lives 
of residents. You can see them come out more in the evening. Buffalo, 
New York, today, where police are encouraged to get out of their squad 
cars and walk the streets. And civilian volunteers escort residents 
on downtown shopping trips. It's called "community policing" -- partnerships 
that have given Buffalo five straight years of falling crime rates. 
The police have to accept the community as our partner. They're our 
eyes and ears out there. The police can't do it alone. What's happening 
out here? Why is it safer in the '90s? Lots of reasons, including 
an older population, less inclined to commit crimes. And a better 
economy. And experts say police are more aggressive -- arrests are 
up and nearly half all murders now solved. There's less drug traffic 
in the '90s. The crack cocaine epidemic no longer out of control and 
there are fewer guns on the street. Despite startling shootings in 
Paducah and Jonesboro, even juvenile crime is down. Professor Al blumstein 
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. We're locking up career 
criminals more often. Police and communities are quite aggressive 
in getting guns away from kids. a word of caution -- not all the statistics 
can be believed. Philadelphia's numbers aren't included in the FBI 
report. Neither is the murder rate in Boca raton, Florida, because 
of reporting scandals but overall, despite scenes like this one in 
Duarte, today's report says the world's most violent industrialized 
country is now a safer place to live. Jim Avila, NBC news, Chicago.
