From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. 
A jury in Santa Monica, California, has acquitted Whitewater figure 
Susan McDougal on all counts of stealing from her former employers. 
The nine-woman, three-man jury said McDougal was not guilty of stealing 
about $50,000 from orchestra conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife, Nancy, 
when she worked for them as a bookkeeper.
