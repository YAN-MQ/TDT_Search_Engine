The government is prepared to evacuate up to 1 million people if Malaysia 
is inundated by floods caused by the La Nina phenomenon, a news report 
said Monday. Zaleha Ismail, the national unity and social development 
minister, said all facilities had been put in place as the number 
of evacuees was expected to be much higher than the 40,000 people 
usually affected by floods each year. She was speaking to reporters 
after being briefed on the situation in flood-hit areas in the northern 
state of Penang, 370 kilometers (220 miles) from Kuala Lumpur, the 
national news agency Bernama reported. With floodwaters now receding 
in several states, there were 1,527 evacuees at 12 relief centers 
in Penang, it added. Heavy rains, landslides and floods are expected 
in December and January when La Nina is expected to be at its peak.
