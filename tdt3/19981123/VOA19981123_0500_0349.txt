Hello again, from Washington, I'm Les Carpenter with Paul Westfieling. 
We're bringing you VOA News Now. Our top story of this hour, of course, 
is Russian President Boris Yeltzin is back in the hospital with what 
is said to be pneumonia. We're waiting for our correspondent in Moscow 
to make contact with us with the very latest information. Meanwhile, 
let's bring you up to speed on what else is going on today.
