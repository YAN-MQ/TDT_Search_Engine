Perhaps the best descriptions of Seamus Heaney's extraordinarily rich 
and varied oeuvre come from the poet's own work: His verse not only 
gleans ``the unsaid off the palpable'' but also captures the ``music 
of what happens,'' both in the domestic sphere and in the larger world 
beyond. Eschewing ideology and ``the diamond absolutes'' of partisans 
on both sides in Northern Ireland, Heaney has created a remarkable 
series of poems that stay ``true to the impact of external reality'' 
while at the same time remaining ``sensitive to the inner laws of 
the poet's being.'' Happily for the reader, the publication of ``Opened 
Ground,'' a new selection of Heaney's poems spanning the years 1966-1996 
and demonstrating the consummate virtuosity of his work, coincides 
with the publication of a monograph on his verse by the Harvard professor 
Helen Vendler, the most astute and eloquent critic of poetry at work 
today. Ms. Vendler's ``Seamus Heaney'' serves as a wonderfully succinct 
road map to the poet's verse, illuminating the effect that both private 
and public events have had on the development of his work, while explicating 
the continual evolution of his style. She shows us how Heaney has 
pushed the boundaries of the traditional lyric poem in his efforts 
to articulate his changing vision of the world, even as she helps 
us to understand his masterly use of sound, symbol, imagery and parable. 
As Heaney points out in his 1995 Nobel lecture, his writing has been 
``a journey where each point of arrival'' has ``turned out to be a 
stepping stone rather than a destination.'' Although the early nature 
poems in ``Death of a Naturalist'' (1966), ``Door Into the Dark'' 
(1969) and ``Wintering Out'' (1972) radiate a tactile, sensuous apprehension 
of rural life, an awareness of mortality and danger intrudes in many 
of these pastoral lyrics, embodied in the images of lice and rats 
and ``a rat-gray fungus'' glutting a basket of berries. Such images 
give way gradually to a growing awareness of a wider social world 
that reaches its culmination in ``North'' (1975), a deservedly famous 
volume that Ms. Vendler regards as ``one of the crucial poetic interventions 
of the 20th century,'' ranking with Eliot's ``Prufrock,'' Wallace 
Stevens' ``Harmonium'' and Frost's ``North of Boston'' in ``its key 
role in the history of modern poetry.'' Violence in Northern Ireland 
had escalated during the late '60s and early '70s, and ``North'' reflected 
the growing mood of desperation with its chilling images of bones 
and graves and a ``skull-capped ground.'' There are a few topical 
allusions to the Troubles: references to a ``new camp for the internees'' 
and ``machine-gun posts.'' But the volume's most powerful poems use 
the archaeological image of ``bog people'' (bodies of murder and sacrificial 
victims, killed during the Iron Age and preserved in European peat 
bogs) as a metaphor for enduring historical violence, a symbol, as 
Ms. Vendler observes, that lends the poems an imaginative scope that 
transcends the journalistic. In later poems, the Troubles of Northern 
Ireland will often take a back seat to more personal and philosophical 
concerns, but they remain a lurking presence. In one poem in ``The 
Spirit Level'' (1996), they explode in a bloody dream ``of bodies 
raining down like tattered meat''; and in another, the hope of their 
cessation (engendered by a 1994 truce between the IRA Provisionals 
and the Ulster paramilitaries) offers a couple _ presumably Heaney 
and his wife, Marie _ the liberating promise of a personal life free 
from the shadow of ``the tribe.'' Questions of political commitment 
also hover around Heaney's frequent re-examinations of his own vocation. 
In the early poem ``Digging,'' the poet compares his pen not to the 
guns of political activists, but to the spade used by his ancestors 
to farm their land. And in the title poem from ``Station Island'' 
(1984), a dazzling, Dantesque meditation in 12 parts, the poet is 
confronted by a series of ghosts who force him to reassess his chosen 
profession: a murdered cousin accuses him of confusing ``evasion and 
artistic tact,'' of having ``whitewashed ugliness,'' while the ghost 
of James Joyce urges him to remain true to his artistic calling, to 
``write for the joy of it,'' to swim out on his own and ``fill the 
element with signatures'' of his ``own frequency.'' Ms. Vendler acutely 
observes that the deaths of Heaney's mother in 1984 and his father 
in 1986 ``caused a tear in the fabric of Heaney's verse,'' and the 
poems in ``The Haw Lantern'' (1987) tend to focus on absences, rather 
than presences, on virtual, metaphorical and metaphysical questions 
rather than material realities. To this reader, the results _ both 
in ``The Haw Lantern'' and the volume that would follow it, ``Seeing 
Things'' (1991) _ are not Heaney's strongest work: The poems here 
often feel disembodied and abstract, ``the real thing'' melting into 
a vague ``republic of conscience.'' Lines like ``High cries were felled 
and a pure change happened'' lack the tactile energy of Heaney's earlier 
work, while the metaphors in poems like ``The Pitchfork'' and ``The 
Skylight'' feel strangely predictable and trite. Perhaps such transitional 
difficulties were necessary for Heaney to move on to the poems in 
``The Spirit Level'' (1996), verse that attests to the poet's re-embrace 
and reimagining of ordinary life. It is a return, in many respects, 
to the farm world of his earliest nature poems, but with a notable 
difference: There is an elegiac music in this verse, a sense of hard-won 
optimism tempered by a new wisdom and acceptance. The poem ``Keep 
Going,'' Ms. Vendler observes, is a tribute to the life of the poet's 
brother, Hugh, who stayed in the North to maintain the family farm, 
``remaining equable through the horrors of the Troubles, and living 
in peace with his neighbors.'' It leaves us with an image of everyday 
life surviving the terrors of sectarian politics and murder, and celebrates 
the virtues of ``keeping going.'' It also leaves us with a renewed 
appreciation of Heaney's own art, an art, in Heaney's own words, that 
makes space ``for the marvelous as well as for the murderous,'' an 
art that commemorates the endurance of the private in the face of 
history and public grief. PUBLICATION NOTES: `OPENED GROUND' Selected
