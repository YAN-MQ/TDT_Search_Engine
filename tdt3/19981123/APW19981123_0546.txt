The Spanish hotel giant Sol Melia announced Monday it will merge its 
various units to create a hotel group it said will be the world's 
ninth largest. Sol Melia, owned by the Escarrer family, will fully 
absorb Melia Inversiones Americanas, which specializes in Latin America 
and the Caribbean, and the family's private hotel-construction business 
Inmotel. Sol Melia, Spain's largest hotel management company, operates 
more than 250 hotels and handles some 65,000 rooms in 25 countries. 
Founded by Gabriel Escarrer in 1956 with the first Sol Hotel, it became 
the center of his family's hotel empire. ``The integration of the 
three companies into one will provide greater financial stability 
that will allow us to maximize opportunities for future growth and 
have a leading position in the world,'' Escarrer, the company's chairman, 
said Monday in a press release. The merger operation will be concluded 
in the first quarter of 1999 and will reduce company costs.
