The International Labor Organization, the ILO, says workers today 
face many of the same dangers that existed in the 1930s. Lisa Schlein 
in Geneva reports the information is included in the new ILO book 
and lists thousands of threats to health and safety in the work place. 
The massive volume contains more than 4,000 pages of information about 
hazards in the work place as well as actions which can be taken to 
protect people on the job. The ILO's Occupational Safety and Health 
chief Yuka Takala says that because of rapid population growth and 
greater industrialization, more people than ever before are being 
killed on the job. In the world we have every year about 335,000 fatal 
accidents, and altogether 1.1 million fatal occupational accidents 
and diseases. That's every year, and that means some more than 3,000 
people die every day caused by occupation. Mr. Takala says the economic 
costs are also huge. Up to 4 percent of the world's gross national 
product is lost due to job-related accidents and disease. The ILO 
book says traditional threats range from factory fires to the spread 
of tuberculosis in hospitals. And it says new work place concerns 
include eye and hand strain from working on computers, jet lag in 
business travel and radiation leaks in nuclear power plants. The ILO 
lists lung diseases as among the top 10 leading work-related diseases 
and injuries. It says asthma is the most prevalent occupational lung 
disease in developed countries. Mr. Takala says workers are exposed 
to both old and new threats in the agricultural sector and the paper 
and pulp industries. Mining is traditionally and today is one of the 
most dangerous occupations. Similarly, building and contraction, high-rise 
buildings, people are falling down simply because of the high altitudes 
and the falling objects. And fishing, forestry, these are the traditional 
major problem areas. Other new occupational hazards listed by the 
ILO include reproductive and genetic dangers. The study says these 
arise from possibly harmful substances and genetic agents in the work 
place environment. The ILO says developing countries have the worst 
occupational safety and health records, but it says industrialized 
countries also have much to do to improve the working conditions of 
their employees. Lisa Schlein for VOA News, Geneva.
