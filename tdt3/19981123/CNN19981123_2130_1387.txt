Ah, the possibilities Dodge caravan opens up. It's a cabin in the 
Woods... complete with heated power recliners. It's your own private 
ski lodge... or your workshop for building one. It's your place in 
the sun complete with guest room and breezeway. Dodge caravan. The 
world's most popular home away from home.
