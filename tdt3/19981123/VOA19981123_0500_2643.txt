You're listening to VOA News Now. We're broadcasting live from Washington 
on this Monday. I'm Paul Westfieling along with Les Carpenter. It's 
Universal time. Have you talked about your child's health today? Hey, 
guys and gals, are you going to have children one day? Sure you are. 
Everybody does. But do you realize the health of those children is 
in your hands right now? In today's world, young people must talk 
about their child's health and do something about it even before they're 
conceived. Why? If you have unprotected sex and you get AIDS, you 
put a death sentence on yourself and your future partner and unborn 
children. Think about that and do something. Keep your child from 
becoming a statistic. Fight the AIDS epidemic through education and 
counseling. Stay with us. Still to come: Katherine Cole will have 
this week's news from U.S. popular music, so don't go away.
