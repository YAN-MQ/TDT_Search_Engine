We begin with the right to die. Dr. Jack Kevorkian has been the most 
outspoken advocate for his controversial point of view. Now he's used 
a videotape and a national television audience to taunt authorities 
going to a new extreme. Before we debate the bottom line, we begin 
with this report from NBC news correspondent Pete Williams. Michigan 
authorities today say they're investigating what they call an aparent 
homicide case involving Dr. Kevorkian and a videotaped death televised 
last night of Tom youk, a once-vigorous man suffering from a Terminal 
muscle disease. It appeared a homicide was committed in violation 
of the laws of the state of Michigan. However, a charging decision 
will not be made until the videotapes are viewed in their entirety. 
Kevorkian says he did it to challenge the new law passed this year 
against assisted suicide in his home state of Michigan. But this case 
seems different from the suicides Kevorkian also assisted, where he 
left the patient in control to push the button. This time, Kevorkian 
himself says he injected the drugs directly into the patient, recorded 
the process, and gave videotape to CBS news 60 minutes. He says he 
wanted to shift public debate away from suicide to euthanasia. In 
an enlightened society, we shouldn't allow individuals to suffer. 
We shouldn't allow them to have to suffer just because some parts 
of society, the vocal minority of society, is saying this is inappropriate. 
But among some advocates for the terminally ill, this case has produced 
strong criticism. In Oregon, supports of the assisted suicide law 
say they oppose doctors administering the lethal dose. The patient 
needs to be in control. If the physician is in control, it's open 
to abuse and you don't have that very important safeguard of patient 
choice and patient control. But many experts in medical ethics say 
there's really no difference, that both are wrong for doctors to do, 
and that by taping the death, Kevorkian complicates the question. 
His technique is simply to avoid serious questions and to simply sensationalize 
all issues, and this is another example of that. No doubt Dr. Kevorkian 
wanted to prompt a public debate, but most of it so far has focused 
of the showing of a man's death on television rather than the ethics 
of mercy killing.
