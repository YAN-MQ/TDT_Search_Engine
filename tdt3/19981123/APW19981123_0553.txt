Congolese rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane and 126 troops escaped 
injury when the Boeing 727 they were aboard caught fire while taking 
off in eastern Congo, rebel radio said Monday. The accident occurred 
Sunday in Goma, the eastern rebel stronghold, when the plane owned 
by GOMAIR of Congo hit a hole at the end of runway, Radio Goma said. 
The plane's left wheel burst into flames, which spread to the rear 
engine and the right wheel. The plane stopped about 200 meters (yards) 
into the grass, and pilots and mechanics doused the fire. The plane 
was carrying 127 passengers, most of them troops, and 3.5 tons of 
food to Kisangani, the rebel army's headquarters about 400 kilometers 
(250 miles) northwest of Goma. Radio Goma, monitored in Kigali, said 
Ondekane, 36, ruled out an attempt on his life. He flew to Kisangani, 
his usual base, on another plane on Monday. It was the first known 
plane accident since the rebels began fighting Aug. 2 to overthrow 
President Laurent Kabila. They have run practically nonstop flights 
of Boeing 727s, Russian-built Ilyushin-76s and Antonov transport planes 
to ferry troops and supplies across Africa's third largest nation. 
Planes are often the only means to overcome huge distances, thick 
forests and lack of roads in eastern Congo. Most of the aircraft and 
crews used by the rebels were captured at the beginning of the war. 
Others planes are being leased.
