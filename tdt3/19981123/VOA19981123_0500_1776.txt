Universal time, and this is VOA News Now. Russia's president is back 
in the hospital suffering from pneumonia. President Clinton is on 
his way back to Washington after visits to South Korea, Japan and 
Guam. And we'll hear from the incoming speaker of the U.S. House of 
Representatives on the future of the impeachment hearings against 
the president all in the next half-hour of VOA News Now. Hello, again. 
I'm Les Carpenter along with Paul Westfieling.
