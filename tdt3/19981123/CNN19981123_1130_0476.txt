I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Temperatures today, fairly warm most locations for this time of year, 
even into the 40s over the northern Great Lakes. It will be on the 
windy side there, though. We watch 60s and 70s back down along the 
gulf coast in the southeast. Here's your forecast later today on into 
Tuesday -- we have some wet weather in the southeast today. That will 
move off shore by tomorrow. Our big storm today is in the pacific 
northwest with rain and windy conditions along the coast. And then 
heavier snows will be developing as you head inland into the higher 
elevations. Extended forecast -- on Wednesday, we'll find rain in 
the Great Lakes and rain and windy conditions continuing in the pacific 
northwest. Showers and storms will extend southward into the Mississippi 
river valley. On Thanksgiving day, it looks like it will rain in the 
northeast with showers and storms in the southeast. Again, temperatures 
are fairly mild in most locations. And particularly mild along the 
front range of the Rockies. Find some showers scattered right on into 
Friday in the pacific northwest as the rain continues in the northeast.
