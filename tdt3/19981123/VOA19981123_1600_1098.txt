European football chiefs have decided to postpone a European champions 
league match because of a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Italy. 
The Turkish Club Gallatosserie was to have hosted Uvantos on Wednesday 
in Istanbul, but the contest will now take place on December 2 at 
the same venue. Relations between Italy and Turkey have been strained 
since Italy arrested Kurdish rebel Abdullah Orjalon last week and 
refused Turkish requests to extradite him. European football officials 
are hoping the situation will cool by next month. The Italian players 
expressed concern for their safety after thousands of protesters in 
Turkey burned Italian flags and goods over the weekend.
