Russian President Boris Yeltzin is back in the hospital, this time 
suffering pneumonia. Mr. Yeltzin, however, is still planning with 
Chinese leaders. President Clinton ends his visit to Asia with new 
warnings to North Korea about his nuclear and missile programs. Iraq 
and Chief and U.N. Arms Inspector Butler take their argument over 
missing documents to the U.N. Security Council today. And a look at 
how much society is changing in Iran since the president, Mohammed 
Katame was elected 18 months ago. I am Paul Westfieling. And I'm Les 
Carpenter. Details just ahead, plus we'll have sports, a business 
update and the week's music news all in this hour of VOA News Now. 
But first... VOA News is next. 50.70
