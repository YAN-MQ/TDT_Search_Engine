I'm Becky Bailey, VOA News. Russian president Boris Yeltzin has been 
hospitalized in Moscow with what doctors describe as pneumonia, but 
he still plans to meet with visiting Chinese leader Xan Zi Man. A 
Kremlin spokesman says Mr. Yeltzin felt ill Sunday and was taken to 
the Central Clinical Hospital. The Kremlin says Mr. Yeltzin will hold 
talks with President Xan in the hospital today. We asked VOA's Gil 
Butler in Moscow if this is an effort by the Kremlin to show that 
Mr. Yeltzin's illness is not serious. I think that this is especially 
a bad time for this kind of thing to have happened because there's 
talk in the lower house of the Russian parliament among the Communist 
deputies who control the Duma that they want to end Mr. Yeltzin's 
presidency on the grounds that he can't, you know, perform his duties. 
Mr. Xan also meets with Prime Minister Ugeni Primokov and other officials 
before going to Japan for a state visit.
