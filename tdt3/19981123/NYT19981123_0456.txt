With the $206 billion tobacco settlement freshly signed and record 
price increases looming, shareholders who have come this far may be 
wondering what's next for tobacco stocks? The stocks, which had been 
held down by concerns about how much the settlement might cost, began 
a recovery last week that continued Monday. As the stock market in 
general rose to record highs, the Philip Morris Companies rose $2.50 
a share, to $58.25; the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. climbed $1.1875, 
to $31.625, and the Loews Corp. rose $3.0625, to $104.375. Additionally, 
the Brooke Group rose $6.4375 a share, to $17.4375, though investors 
were also responding to the announcement Friday that the company was 
selling domestic rights to three of its best-known cigarette brands 
to Philip Morris. While the settlement puts a price tag on what had 
been a large uncertainty, other issues that could have a significant 
impact on tobacco stocks remain unresolved. Among them is a class-action 
lawsuit pending before the Florida Supreme Court that accuses leading 
tobacco companies of causing illness. Analysts are also concerned 
about the effect that price increases _ long expected to finance the 
settlement costs _ will have on cigarette sales. Some believe the 
effect will not be drastic; others are less optimistic. A widely held 
belief is that sales drop 4 percent for every price rise of 10 percent. 
The price increases are expected to be as high as 40 cents to 50 cents 
a pack, a rise of at least 20 percent more than the $1.95 average 
cost now. Philip Morris led the way Monday with a 45-cent jump, which 
a company spokeswoman said would affect shipments starting Tuesday. 
The rises would be the highest in the industry's history and, while 
expected to be offset somewhat by discounting, will almost certainly 
mean diminished sales in the short run. ``It's a fine line they're 
walking,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for Merrill Lynch &AMP; 
Co. ``If you're selling Marlboro or Camel, you hate for people to 
leave your major brands and go down to something cheaper.'' Marc Cohen, 
an analyst for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., has already slashed his earnings 
estimates based on what he sees as falling demand from consumers and 
merchants alike. ``We think cigarette prices are going to rise by 
45 to 50 cents a pack in 1999,'' he said, ``and the consequence is 
that consumption is going to fall by 9 percent. In addition, we expect 
a de-stocking by wholesalers and retailers that is going to cause 
industry shipments to fall by 13 percent.'' Another huge cost is promotional 
spending, which Cohen said had ``skyrocketed over the last year'' 
and shows no signs of abating. He has cut his 1999 earnings estimates 
for Philip Morris by 20 cents a share, to $3.30, and reduced estimates 
for RJR Nabisco by 55 cents, to $1.80. Questions about spinning off 
the food businesses at Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco seem to be on 
hold pending resolution of the Florida case and other issues. The 
individual units of Philip Morris, which owns Kraft General Foods, 
have been thought to be worth more if split off than when packaged 
with the domestic tobacco business. The same might hold true for RJR 
Nabisco, though the food unit there has struggled for the last couple 
of years. ``Investors are going to be disappointed by the speed at 
which those spinoffs happen,'' Cohen said. ``And they are unlikely 
to happen in the case of Philip Morris.'' Other analysts also believe 
spinoffs, which can increase the value of a company, are at least 
a year away. Finally, there is the deal announced last week, in which 
Philip Morris paid the Brooke Group and its subsidiary, Liggett Group, 
$300 million for domestic rights to the L&AMP;M, Chesterfield and 
Lark brands. At least one analyst believes that deal could cause a 
major realignment in the tobacco industry, since it could signal another 
corporate raid on RJR Nabisco. Bennett S. LeBow, the principal shareholder 
of Brooke Group, would benefit by divesting those brands since Brooke's 
market share would become too small to be included in the overall 
tobacco settlement. ``Now he's got a clean balance sheet, he could 
borrow a bunch of debt, and the world has been turned upside down,'' 
said Gary Black, a tobacco analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, referring 
to LeBow, who waged an unsuccessful proxy fight for control of RJR 
in 1996. ``He's the big winner in this. He will try to make another 
run at RJR, using his clean balance sheet.'' The deal is subject to 
approval by the Justice Department, but Philip Morris has apparently 
expressed confidence in its success: Black said half the purchase 
price, or $150 million, was nonrefundable under the terms to which 
the company agreed. The Federal Trade Commission also said Monday 
that it would drop its lawsuit against RJR Nabisco over the use of 
the Joe Camel character in ads for its Camel cigarettes. The settlement 
includes a prohibition on cartoon characters in advertising.
