Today's geography quiz leads us to a capital city that's been called 
a melting pot of the East and West. It wasn't always a capital. It 
became one 75 years ago, replacing Istanbul. If you're a history buff, 
you might want to visit this city's museum of Anatolian civilization 
because that's one of the few places where you'll find much evidence 
of the ancient past. Instead, there is plenty of European charm here, 
and yes, of course, plenty of American fast food chains. But if you're 
looking for an authentic culinary experience, then you'll slip into 
one of the city's pudding shops. You can enjoy one basic chocolate 
and vanilla pudding, as well as an unusual one that's dairy free and 
lightly seasoned with saffron. We'll not only tell you the answer 
to our geography quiz, but we'll tell you how to make that pudding 
in just a few minutes.
