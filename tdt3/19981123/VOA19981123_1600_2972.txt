We had an explosive rally today. We've brought the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average to a record high for the first time in 4 months. The Dow closed 
at 9,374. That was up 214 points, or more than 2 percent, and it was 
37 points above the old record of 9,337 which was set on July 17th. 
It sure was a fast comeback for the stock markets since that industrial 
average had sunk down to the 7,500 level back in early September. 
Standard and Poor's 500 Index closed today at 1,188. That was up 24 
points and also a record high.
