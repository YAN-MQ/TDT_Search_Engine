huff. Hi, Janice. hi. The pacific northwest can can can't seem to 
get a break in the wux. Another storm rolling through tonight, packing 
a punch with wind, rain, and snow from the cascades on downward. Snow 
levels will be dropping about 3,500 feet. There are high wind warnings 
in effect. Heavy rain also rolling across north Florida and south 
Georgia tonight with an upper level disturbance. Right now it's 72

some much colder air. Temperatures in the 20's and 30's overnight 
for the northern plains and parts of the Rockies as well, of course 
in the snow areas, plenty of cold and snow. Temperatures will be mild 
tomorrow from about San Francisco across the country into the Texas 
Panhandle, 60's and 70's. Dallas will be at 67 degrees. Thunderstorms

As we look ahead towards Thanksgiving, with a lot of people traveling, 
we'll see very stormy weather across the northeast with snow over 
the Great Lakes, rain from New York City, where the Macy's Thanksgiving 
day parade will be taking place, up to Boston. Cool across most of 
the southeast except for south Florida. More showers for northern 
California on Thanksgiving day. That's the weather around the nation.
