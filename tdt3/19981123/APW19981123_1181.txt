Israeli, American and Palestinian members of a new committee to track 
incitement will hold their first meeting Tuesday as part of the recent 
Mideast peace agreement. Yoash Sidon, chairman of the Israeli delegation 
said Monday that the committee was intended to monitor a Palestinian 
crackdown on anti-Israel incitement and would meet at least every 
two weeks once the agenda was fixed. ``We're trying to reduce 50 years 
of anti-Israel incitement on the Palestinian streets,'' Sidon said. 
Incitement and anti-Semitic rhetoric in Palestinian-run media and 
in speeches by officials has angered both the current and former Israeli 
governments. A committee to weed-out incitement was a key demand by 
the Israelis in the new peace accord. In a speech to parliament last 
week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited several recent examples 
he found offensive including a religious program on Palestine TV calling 
Jews the work of Satan. The committee is made up of four members from 
each side, including elected officials, legal and educational experts, 
and media specialists, Sidon said. The American delegation was to 
include former California congressman Mel Levine, who has worked to 
raise money for housing in Palestinian areas, said a U.S. official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said that the Americans 
would largely act as observers of the dialogue to take place between 
Palestinians and Israelis.
