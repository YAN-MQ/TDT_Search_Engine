We now inaugurate the Pundits Aid Society, committed to helping distressed 
columnists in search of roots. In one of his occasional columns titled 
``Ask Mr. Language Person,'' the humorist Dave Barry purportedly received 
this question: ``I am in the field of business, and people keep saying 
they want to `touch base' with me. They'll say, `I just wanted to 
touch base with you on the Fooberman contract' or `We need to touch 
base on the rental sheep for the sales conference.' But my understanding 
of the rules is that if you touch base WITH somebody, at the same 
time, at least one of you is out. So my question is, Who the heck 
is `Fooberman'?'' The answer from Barry's Mr. Language Person: ``We 
decided to consult with William Safire ... but his number is not listed.'' 
It's my e-mail that's not listed. But I bought a copy of The Sunday 
Washington Post, turned to Wit's End in the magazine (as the Barry 
column is called there) and got the message. It's a shortening of 
the baseball rule touch all bases. Paul Dickson, whose New Dickson 
Baseball Dictionary is coming out in February, off-season, says: ``The 
baseball term means you have to make contact with the three bases 
in your way around the base path to home plate. That's why coaches 
tell players to remember to touch all the bases.'' That was extended 
to the general language in the sense of ``to get in contact with,'' 
as in ``I better touch base with my mother; she gets sore when I don't 
call.'' The more frequent sense is ``to obtain the approval of,'' 
as in ``touch base with you on the Fooberman contract.'' Because the 
metaphoric extension of the baseball term is not yet in the Oxford 
English Dictionary, the ``approval'' sense seems relatively recent, 
with citations in the late '70s. The most memorable case of base non-touching 
took place on Sept. 23, 1908. With two outs in the last half of the 
ninth inning, the game tied 1-1, the Giants had runners on first and 
third. The Giant hitter singled, scoring the man from third and apparently 
winning the game. The runner on first, Fred Merkle, age 19, turned 
and gleefully headed for the clubhouse celebration. But the Chicago 
Cub second baseman, Johnny Evers (of the famed Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance 
double-play combination), spotted what he believed to be an infraction 
of the rules. He called for a ball from the umpire and stepped on 
second base, claiming to have retired Merkle on a force-out. The crowd 
had poured onto the field, and play could not be resumed; the game 
was called a tie. In the tie-breaking game two weeks later, the Giants 
lost the game and the pennant. This popularized the slang term bonehead, 
an American alteration of the British blockhead. The Chicago Tribune, 
on Sept. 24, 1908, wrote, ``Then came the bonehead finish. ...'' The 
errant player, an otherwise intelligent first baseman, went through 
a 16-year career known as Fred ``Bonehead'' Merkle because he failed 
to touch base. It is a mild epithet for stupidity, one that Al D'Amato 
probably wishes he had used against the new senator from New York, 
Charles Schumer. The second distressed syndicated columnist seeking 
help from the free services of the Pundits Aid Society is Richard 
Cohen of The Washington Post: ``I am enclosing Evan Thomas' review 
of the Nina Burleigh book on Mary Meyer. I direct your attention to 
the last graph ((punditese for ``paragraph'')) in which Evan says, 
`Writing in his journal ... shortly after he had been both promoted 
at the CIA and cuckolded by his wife ....' I thought it is the male 
lover, not the wife, who cuckolds the husband. I have turned to the 
American Heritage dictionary, but without success. (The derivation 
of cuckold sure is interesting, though.) Please clear this up for 
me.'' Gladly. The cuckoo bird is said to have the habit of laying 
its eggs in another bird's nest, leaving them to be cared for by the 
other, adoptive bird. That led to cuckold, ``a derisive term for a 
husband who has been the victim of adultery, the party betrayed by 
an unfaithful wife.'' All 29 uses of the word in Shakespeare are directed 
at the husband betrayed, or at least believing his wife to be fooling 
around. Othello: ``I will chop her into messes,'' he roars, when the 
sly Iago unfairly accuses his wife, Desdemona. How dare she ``Cuckold 
me!'' In most citations of this word in the OED, first used around 
the year 1250 (this has been going on a long time), it is the wife 
who cuckolds the husband. This is etymologically consistent: The female 
cuckoo bird is the one who lays the eggs in the wrong nest. Male cuckoos 
just fly around and make a distinctive sound immortalized in clocks. 
Thus the columnist Cohen has too narrow a focus: It is both the unfaithful 
wife and the seductive paramour, her male lover, who do the cuckolding 
of the husband. But this leads to two other questions that cry out 
for answers. We know that the horns of the cuckold are worn by the 
deceived husband, but why horns? One answer in mythology: that cheatin' 
Actaeon, a hunter, was turned into a stag by Diana. The OED suggests 
that the horns come from the practice of planting spurs of a castrated 
rooster on the excised comb of another fowl, where they sometimes 
grew several inches long. This free service to pundits does not cover 
research into why 16th-century poulterers did this, but the German 
for cuckold originally meant ``capon.'' The second question is more 
pertinent. Worldly-wise lexicographers know that adultery is not a 
one-way street. Is there a word to describe a wife who has been betrayed 
by her husband? Wronged seems weak. What is the cheatin'-husband equivalent 
of the noun cuckold? ``Your reader was wrong about there being no 
word for a female cuckold,'' Barry Rein of Azusa, Calif., wrote to 
the Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith in 1989. ``It is cuckquean. 
Look it up in the OED.'' There it is: ``Ye make hir a cookqueane'' 
is the 1562 usage by John Heywood. In his 1922 novel, ``Ulysses,'' 
James Joyce retrieved it from antiquity: ``her gay betrayer, their 
common cuckquean.'' Once again, English shows itself to be an equal-opportunity 
language.
