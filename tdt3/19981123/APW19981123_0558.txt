European Union farm ministers were expected Monday to lift a worldwide 
export ban on the vast majority of British beef, a milestone in the 
``mad cow'' crisis that has pitted Britain against its EU allies for 
almost three years. ``The time is right,'' said EU Farm Commissioner 
Franz Fischler ahead of Monday's EU farm ministers meeting, which 
was set to scrap the ban on deboned beef despite continued opposition 
from at least Germany and Austria. The decision will go a long way 
in ending the ``mad cow'' crisis for British farmers, who were badly 
hit by the March 1996 ban. Estimated losses because of the ban amount 
to over 2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.3 billion). The crisis undermined 
confidence in beef throughout the 15 member nations. Monday's expected 
decision ``will tend to boost the confidence of the British consumer 
and presumably other consumers throughout the EU and our beef trade 
and our beef producers will get back to normal,'' said Dr. John Mann, 
superintendent of Smithfield Market, Britain's largest meat market. 
A panel of veterinary experts voted earlier this month to ease the 
ban. Exports of British beef were banned in March 1996 after Britain 
announced a possible link between ``mad cow'' disease in British beef 
and a fatal brain ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. 
Monday's expected decision will be immediately followed by a campaign 
to put British beef back on the plates of consumers throughout the 
15-nation EU. Beef exports though will need a final stamp of approval 
after another EU inspection round, opening the way for exports early 
in the new year. ``We will get the decision we want. We have done 
what we were asked to do and can justify Britain's position on the 
basis of science and the technical implementation,'' said British 
Farm Minister Nick Brown. British government cooperation didn't always 
come that easy. After the March 1996 ban, the Conservative government 
of Prime Minister John Major tried to get the ban lifted and threatened 
not to cooperate with the EU. Relations with Brussels improved considerably 
when Tony Blair became Prime Minister in May 1997. EU Farm Minister 
approved a resumption of beef exports from Northern Ireland in March. 
Before the ban, Britain exported some 270,000 tons of beef, worth 
dlrs 1 billion, in 1995. Now British exporters face the task of reclaiming 
lost markets. ``It will take some time, perhaps a couple of years 
and then we'll be back to our normal export trade levels,'' said Mann.
