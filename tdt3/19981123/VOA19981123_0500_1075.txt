This is VOA News Now from Washington. I'm Les Carpenter along with 
Paul Westfieling. Let's look at the top news story of the hour. And 
of course, it's President Yeltzin back in the hospital suffering from 
pneumonia. He was admitted to the state-run Clinical Medical Hospital 
after coming down with a high fever on Sunday. We'll have details 
on that coming up. And it's time for sports. Here's Ray Cougal.
