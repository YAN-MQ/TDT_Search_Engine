First Lady Hilary Rodham Clinton has promised more U.S. aid to Haiti 
to help repair damage caused by Hurricane George. Ms. Clinton announced 
Sunday the United States will add $2.1 million to an existing $12 
million storm relief package. Hurricane George killed more than 220 
people and left thousands homeless in Haiti. The first lady arrived 
in Haiti Saturday, the last stop on a 6-day tour of countries that 
were ravaged by this season's hurricanes. Ms. Clinton's tour included 
Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. 
More than 11,000 people were killed in Central America last month 
by Hurricane Mitch alone.
