B.F. Goodrich is buying col-tech industries for about $2.2 billion. 
The purchase will expand B.F. Goodrich's stance in the aerospace and 
industrial products sectors. The merged operation would have about 
22,000 workers and will be based in charlotte, North Carolina. That 
means the loss of more than 100 jobs at B.F. Goodrich headquarters 
in richfield, Ohio. The combined companies expect to have $5.5 billion 
in revenues in the first year. And they expect to save $61 million 
a year by the year 2001.
