German and Italian leaders this week will discuss the fate of a Kurdish 
rebel chief who has sought political asylum in Italy but is wanted 
on German terrorism charges, a government spokesman said Monday. Germany 
has deferred asking Italy for Abdullah Ocalan's extradition for trial, 
apparently because of fears of unrest among its 2 million Turkish 
residents, a quarter of whom are Kurds. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
and Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema will take up the case at talks 
scheduled Friday in Bonn, spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said. They will 
try ``to see whether there are possibilities to develop something 
from this situation that is helpful for all involved,'' he said. He 
refused to elaborate. Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 in Rome. A Rome 
court freed him Friday, rejecting a Turkish warrant for the man Turkey 
considers its most-wanted criminal. He was ordered to stay in Rome 
until Dec. 23 to give Germany time to consider an extradition request. 
Germany's federal prosecutor's office said last weekend it had drafted 
a broader arrest warrant for Ocalan, going beyond 1990 charges of 
a single murder in Germany. The magazine Der Spiegel said the new 
charges included ``liquidation of a string of dissidents'' in Germany 
in the 1980s and several arson attacks in 1993. Heye insisted Monday 
that the fresh charges left unchanged Germany's decision to put off 
an extradition request for now. A Justice Ministry spokesman described 
the revised warrant as a legal technicality. Ocalan leads the Kurdistan 
Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy 
for Kurds in Turkey's southeast. Some 37,000 people have been killed.
