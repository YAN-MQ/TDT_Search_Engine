Meredith (Flash) Gourdine, the 1952 Olympic silver medalist in the 
long jump and later an engineer and physicist with 70 patents that 
deal with thermal management and the conversion of gas to electricity, 
died Friday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Houston. He was 69. The cause 
of death was complications from multiple strokes, said his son, Meredith 
Jr. He had also been suffering from diabetes and had gradually lost 
his sight. Gourdine's success in track and field was more than matched 
by his scientific achievements later. The companies he founded worked 
on purifying the air and converting low-grade coal into inexpensive, 
transportable and high-voltage electrical energy. They produced a 
commercial air-pollution deterrent, a high-powered industrial paint 
spray and a device to eliminate fog above airports. His sports career 
flourished at Cornell University, where at 6 feet and 175 pounds he 
competed in the sprints and low hurdles and the long jump. He won 
four titles in the championships of the Intercollegiate Association 
of Amateur Athletes of America and five titles in the Heptagonal Games. 
In 1952, he helped Cornell finish second to Southern California in 
the National Collegiate Athletic Association championships, in which 
Southern California had 36 athletes and Cornell 5. His greatest achievement 
and greatest frustration in sports came in the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, 
Finland. Jerome Biffle, another American, won the gold medal in the 
long jump at 24 feet 10 inches. Gourdine finished second, an inch 
and a half behind. ``I would have rather lost by a foot,'' he said 
years later. ``I still have nightmares about it.'' Meredith Charles 
Gourdine was born Sept. 26, 1929, in Newark. He was raised in Brooklyn, 
where his father was a painter and a janitor. After classes at Brooklyn 
Tech High School, he worked eight hours a day on painting jobs with 
his father. The son recalled: ``My father said, `If you don't want 
to be a laborer all your life, stay in school.' It took.'' The youngster 
did not run until his senior year in high school and never won a race 
there, but his swimming prowess earned a scholarship offer from the 
University of Michigan. Instead, he went to Cornell and paid his way 
most of the first two years. In 1952, after he had earned a bachelor's 
degree in engineering, Gourdine became an officer in the United States 
Navy. In 1960, on a Guggenheim fellowship, he earned a doctorate in 
engineering science from the California Institute of Technology. After 
four years in private industry, he borrowed $200,000 from friends 
and opened a research and development firm, Gourdine Systems, in Livingston, 
N.J. In 1973, he founded Energy Innovations in Houston to produce 
direct-energy conversion devices. He was the chief executive there 
until his death. He is survived by his wife, the former Carolina Baling; 
his son; three daughters from a previous marriage, Teri Bruce of Englewood, 
N.J., Traci of Davis, Calif., and Toni of Montclair, N.J.; five grandchildren, 
and a sister, Charlotte Williams of Altadena, Calif.
