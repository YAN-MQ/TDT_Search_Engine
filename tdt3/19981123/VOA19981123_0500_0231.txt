Well, the European Union's finance ministers meet today to discuss 
better coordination when a single currency is introduced in 11 of 
the 15 countries on New Years Day. VOA's Ron Pimstein reports from 
Brussels that Socialist finance ministers have already set out their 
economic agenda. Europe's most important economies -- France, Germany, 
Italy and Britain -- are all controlled by left-wing governments. 
Eleven Socialist and Social Democratic finance ministers met last 
night for dinner in advance of today's meeting of all 15 union finance 
ministers. They released their joint program titled The New European 
Way. The new way is to emphasize job creation and economic growth 
as the main objective instead of the previous concentration on fighting 
inflation. The document talks about fiscal discipline but calls for 
a necessary degree of fiscal flexibility in the case of economic downturns. 
Such talk gives heartburn to the European Central Bank that takes 
over monetary policy from national governments in the 11 countries 
introducing the Euro currency. The document calls for close economic 
coordination between the 11 countries introducing the new currency 
on New Year's Day, and those like Britain, Greece, Denmark and Sweden 
that will not. Ron Pimstein, VOA News, Brussels.
