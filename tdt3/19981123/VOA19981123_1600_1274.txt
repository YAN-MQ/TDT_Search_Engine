Well, the Miami Dolphins are hoping to stay on top in the National 
Football League's AFC East Division as they visit the New England 
Patriots in Foxborough, Massachusetts, later today. With a record 
of seven wins and three losses this season, the Dolphins have sole 
possession of the top spot in the division. They are one-half game 
ahead of the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills. Meanwhile, for the 
injury-riddled Patriots, this is a must-win game. After a strong start, 
New England has lost four of its last five games and now has a 5-5 
record. If the Dolphins win, they will become the all-time victory 
leaders in Monday night football games. They are currently tied with 
the Oakland Raiders with 33 wins.
