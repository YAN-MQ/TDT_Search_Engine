Many of our local F.M. and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a 2-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Here's a question for you: 
why should you make VOA News Now a major source of information in 
your life? Well, first of all we bring you the latest news any time 
you tune in. Second, we have correspondents on duty around the world 
and around the clock to keep you up-to-date wherever news is happening. 
And finally, since we're a service of the Voice of America, you can 
turn to us to learn about events across America that affect the rest 
of the world, not to mention updates on U.S. pop culture and American 
sports heros. Now here's a very brief user's guide to VOA News Now. 
Every half-hour begins with a thorough world news roundup. Sports 
fans can get the latest results at 18 minutes past the hour, and investors 
get the latest financial figures every business day at 49 minutes 
past the hour. We hope you stay tuned. Right now, we're coming up 
on 22 hours Universal time, and it means we're closing down all frequencies 
to the Middle East, North Africa and Europe.
