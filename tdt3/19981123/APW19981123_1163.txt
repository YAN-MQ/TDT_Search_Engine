Hayden Fry, who turned a woeful football program into a three-time 
Rose Bowl participant, is leaving Iowa after 20 seasons. Fry was the 
winningest coach in Iowa history, but his teams had trouble staying 
with the Big Ten powers in the 1990s after winning three conference 
championships from 1981 to 1990. This year's team finished 3-8, the 
worst in his stay at Iowa. ``It's kind of hard to do,'' the 69-year-old 
coach said today. ``All the people that gave me am opportunity to 
spend 20 years as a member of the Hawkeye family, I could never repay 
them.'' Fry, who inherited a program that had gone 17 years without 
a winning season when he came to Iowa City in 1979, took the Hawkeyes 
to 14 bowl games and built a 143-89-6 record to become one of the 
most popular figures in the state. He said he had considered quitting 
two years ago but stayed out of concern for his assistants and the 
effect his departure would have had on recruiting. A bowl game at 
the end of the 1997 season also prevented him from quitting for similar 
reasons. ``I'd have rather gone out with a real good season,'' said 
Fry, his voice faltering at times as he wiped tears with a handkerchief. 
``I really felt like we could have a good year,'' he said. ``I've 
always been an optimist, but I never dreamed that we would experience 
all the problems we had ... . But I'm very proud of this team this 
year, even in defeat.'' After going 5-6 and 4-7 in his first two seasons, 
Fry in 1981 took the Hawkeyes to their first appearance in the Rose 
Bowl since the 1958 season. They lost to Washington 28-0. Iowa also 
made Rose Bowl trips under Fry after the 1985 and 1990 seasons, both 
losses. Iowa was ranked No. 1 nationally for six weeks in 1985, the 
only time during his tenure that his team was top-ranked. Fry, who 
played quarterback at Baylor, began his coaching career as an assistant 
at his alma mater in 1960. Two years later, he became head coach at 
SMU, where his teams made three bowl trips in 11 years. He then spent 
six years as head coach at North Texas State, compiling a 40-23-3 
record before taking the Iowa job in December 1978. The Hawkeyes had 
gone winless in 1973 and were just 2-9 the season before Fry became 
coach.
