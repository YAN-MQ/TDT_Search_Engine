Four Russian border guards officers have been sentenced to prison 
terms from 15 to 23 years for brutal harrassment of young conscripts, 
officials said Monday. The officers, who served with a border guard 
unit in the Far Eastern region of Chukotka, were convicted of beating 
and torturing their soldiers, leading to the death of one conscript, 
border guards officials said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
The report did not say when they were sentenced. The investigation 
revealed that the officers were regularly beating their men for minor 
offenses, leaving them without warm clothes in temperatures up to 
-20 degrees C (-4 degrees F) and denying them food, the report said. 
Russia's cash-strapped and demoralized armed forces have been plagued 
by the ritual hazing of young conscripts by older soldiers and officers, 
contributing to frequent shootings and suicides. According to official 
figures, 50 soldiers were killed by fellow servicemen last year, and 
about 500 committed suicide.
