Astronomers working with the Hubble space telescope have released 
photos of galaxies 12 billion light years away. They were able to 
capture the distant image by pointing Hubble in one direction for 
10 straight days. The light left the galaxies 12 billion years ago, 
shortly after what scientists call "the big bang." The image effectively 
doubles the number of distant galaxies available for study.
