This is the Voice of America coming to you from Washington. I'm Tony 
Riggs bringing you this hour of VOA News Now. Have you talked about 
your child's health today? Hey, guys and gals, are you going to have 
children one day? Sure you are. Everybody does. But do you realize 
the health of those children is in your hands right now? In today's 
world, young people must talk about their child's health and do something 
about it even before they're conceived. Why? If you have unprotected 
sex and you get AIDS, you put a death sentence on yourself and your 
future partner and unborn children. Think about that and do something. 
Keep your child from becoming a statistic. Fight the AIDS epidemic 
through education and counseling. At 18 hours Universal time, here 
is the major news story we're following. Iraq has delivered another 
letter to the United Nations Security Council explaining why it has 
not handed over weapons documents requested by Chief U.N. Arms Inspector 
Richard Butler. We'll have more on that and the rest of this hour's 
top news in our next summary 12 minutes from now. Business news comes 
your way in about 30 minutes. Tonight's Dateline examines the dangerous 
job of Aid workers and we'll also learn how the Internet is helping 
young American Indians get in touch with their roots. Please stay 
with us for all that and more as VOA News Now continues. It's time 
now for sports with VOA's Jim Stevenson.
