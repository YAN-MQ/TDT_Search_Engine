Two feuding Roman Catholic bishops in Austria who accuse each other 
of lying took their unprecedented conflict to the Vatican on Monday 
for possible arbitration. The dispute between the archbishop of Vienna, 
Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, and Bishop Kurt Krenn of St. Poelten 
reflects a deeper rift in the Catholic hierarchy the bishops consistently 
deny. At issue is Krenn's claim he was unfamiliar with the contents 
of a five-year report presented Saturday by Austrian bishops at the 
Vatican. His statement, and the resulting feud, have made headlines 
in Austria and drawn sharp criticism from church leaders and Catholic 
lay people. Among other things, the document admitted to clumsy handling 
of a scandal involving retired Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, who was 
accused of sexually abusing young boys and men but never directly 
admitted his guilt. Groer, who had to relinquish all his church functions, 
recently returned from months of Vatican-imposed exile and is reported 
to be terminally ill. A visibly angry Schoenborn disputed Krenn's 
claim last week, telling Austrian state television from Rome on Friday, 
``Objectively, what he (Krenn) said was simply not correct.'' Krenn 
has remained defiant, however, saying ``liars should keep their mouths 
shut.'' Rejecting calls for a public show of repentance, he was quoted 
Monday by the Vienna daily Der Standard as saying, ``Am I now supposed 
to go around in underpants for half a year?'' Krenn also was quoted 
as saying that disciplinary proceedings could only be initiated by 
the Vatican, ``because we are all subject to the pope.'' The feuding 
bishops made an apparent attempt to settle their conflict Monday, 
issuing a joint statement saying they had agreed to take their ``discussion'' 
to ``the competent Roman congregation for bishops _ a Vatican department 
_ and to seek its judgment, if any.'' The Groer affair last year ignited 
a long-simmering conflict between Austrian church leaders favoring 
reforms and others, particularly Krenn, taking a conservative stance 
in line with current Vatican policy.
