Ankle-high boots _ call them booties, if you prefer _ are the perfect 
grounding for this winter's long skirts and trousers. Heel heights 
range from flat to high, to fit just about every preference. Square-toed, 
low-heeled ankle boots in black or brown leather are $245 to $435 
at Barneys New York. Neiman Marcus has low-heeled booties by Tony 
Valentine in black leather with elastic ($350) or side zippers ($375), 
and by Ferragamo in black fabric ($310); mid-high heels by Robert 
Clergerie in stretch fabric ($385), by Via Spiga in black or brown 
leather ($205), and by Goffredo Fantini in stretch fabric or suede 
($285). There are high heels by DKNY in black or pewter leather ($225), 
and by Yves Saint Laurent in black suede ($260). Warren Edwards, 475 
Park Ave. (58th Street), has pointy-toed suede booties with two-inch 
or three-and-a-half-inch heels in black, brown, gray or off-white 
($595 to $750).
