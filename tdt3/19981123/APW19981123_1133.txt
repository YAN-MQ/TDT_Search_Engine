NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Monday postponed for a week a Champions 
League match between Turkey's Galatasaray and Italy's Juventus because 
of escalating tensions between the two countries. The European governing 
body moved the game, scheduled for Wednesday, to Dec. 2. It will be 
played at the same venue in Istanbul. UEFA's executive committee ``asks 
both the Italian and Turkish governments to undertake the necessary 
steps to ensure that the game can be played as indicated under normal 
conditions,'' a statement said. The decision is final and can't be 
appealed, it added. Thousands have taken to the streets over the past 
week to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for 
trial as a terrorist. Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had guaranteed 
the safety of Juventus players, who feared they may be attacked during 
the match in Turkey. ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz 
told private ATV television late Sunday. Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas 
said up to 20,000 police and paramilitary forces would be assigned 
to provide the security during the match. Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir 
on Monday warned a ``heavy hand'' would prevent violence and said 
the police will not allow banners bearing political statements into 
the stadium. Fireworks are also banned. Cheerleaders will be prevented 
from shouting provocative slogans, Ozdemir added. Yilmaz said each 
fan would be searched by police before entering the Ali Sami Yen stadium. 
But still he warned against possible provocations. Turkey wants to 
try Abdullah Ocalan for leading the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, 
which has been waging a guerrilla war for autonomy in Turkey's southeast. 
The conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives. Italy has refused to extradite 
Ocalan, saying its law does not allow extradition if the suspect could 
face execution. Juventus announced Friday that no fans would travel 
with the club to Istanbul. Former Italian sports minister Walter Veltroni 
said he considered the postponement ``a wise decision and one that 
took into account the risks tied to the game.'' ``UEFA recognized 
that there would not be normal conditions if the game was played Wednesday 
in Istanbul,'' Juventus vice president Roberto Bettega said in Turin. 
In Ankara, Galatasaray technical manager Fatih Terim said UEFA ``has 
brought a lot of trouble on itself.'' The decision would increase 
tension between the two countries, he said. ``It was a decision given 
in favor of Juventus,'' with several injured players, the club's deputy 
president, Mehmet Cansun, said on private Star television. ``There 
will not be any changes in the situation in Turkey within a week,'' 
he added. Bettega said Juventus hadn't exerted pressure on UEFA to 
have the game postponed or moved. The postponement means an Italian 
Cup quarterfinal between Juventus and Bologna, slated for Dec. 2, 
will also have to be rescheduled. Terim said Galatasaray has a Turkish 
Cup game on the same date. Both teams have Champions League games 
the following week. Juventus, a European Champions Cup finalist three 
years running, needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its 
chances of qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Turkish underdog 
tops group B with seven points. UEFA said it ``recognizes that none 
of the two clubs is to be held responsible for the reasons that led 
to this decision.''
