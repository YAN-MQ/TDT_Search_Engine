William Kennedy Douglas, the Air Force doctor who cared for Lt. Col. 
John Glenn and the United States' six other original astronauts, died 
on Nov. 15 at Lewisville Medical Center in Lewisville, Texas, near 
Dallas. He was 76 and lived in Albuquerque, N.M. The cause was a viral 
infection, his family said. Douglas fell ill as he and his wife were 
driving back to Albuquerque from Cape Canaveral, Fla., after watching 
Glenn return to space with the launching of the shuttle on Oct. 29. 
Douglas, a lieutenant colonel, took leave from the Air Force from 
1959 to 1962 to work for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
and became one of the earliest practitioners of space medicine. Assigned 
to NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center at Langley Air Force Base, Va., 
he was personally responsible for the medical care and flight preparation 
of the seven Mercury astronauts. He stayed with NASA through the nation's 
first four manned space flights, those of Alan Shepard, Virgil Grissom, 
Glenn and Scott Carpenter. After leaving the service in 1977 with 
the rank of colonel, he joined McDonnell Douglas Corp. as life sciences 
director to help with the design of an orbiting space station. In 
1988, he retired to Albuquerque and the life of an amateur radio operator. 
He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in Alamogordo, 
N.M., in 1992. Douglas was born in Estancia, N.M., near Albuquerque, 
took his premedical training at the University of New Mexico and Texas 
Western College, and received his medical degree from the University 
of Texas Medical School in Galveston. He did postgraduate work at 
the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. He entered 
the Air Force in 1949 and was board-certified in aviation medicine 
in 1956. He is survived by his wife, Mariwade McIlroy Douglas; their 
son, Michael of Tijeras, N.M., and two grandchildren.
