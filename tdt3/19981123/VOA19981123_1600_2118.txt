Webster Hubbell, a close friend of President Clinton and former law 
partner of Hilary Rodham Clinton, has pleaded not guilty to charges 
stemming from a failed savings and loan. Independent counsel Kenneth 
Starr indicted the former top justice department official with 15 
counts of fraud, perjury and impeding a probe by federal agents. The 
agents were investigating the collapse of the Arkansas Savings and 
Loan run by Clinton business partners Jim and Susan McDougal. I'm 
John Burchard, VOA News.
