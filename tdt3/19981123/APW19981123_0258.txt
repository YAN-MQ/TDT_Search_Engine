Britain, the host of a meeting of 16 often-competing Iraqi opposition 
groups, said Monday that it is vital for Iraq to remain a united country 
if the reign of President Saddam Hussein ends. ``We have got to get 
across to people that Iraq could be different, that Saddam Hussein 
is not permanent, is not the only voice for Iraq,'' Foreign Office 
Minister Derek Fatchett said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio 
interview before the meeting. British officials label the meeting 
the first of a series, reflecting the greater frankness by the United 
States and Britain that a prime aim in ending the stalemate over U.N. 
weapons inspections is to topple Saddam. The United States announced 
last week that it had held talks with Ahmed Chalabi, head of the the 
Iraqi National Congress, a London-based opposition group. The U.S. 
Congress also has approved a dlrs 97 million aid package to offer 
support to Iraqi dissidents. British officials said they would focus 
on finding common ground among the opposition groups. ``If and when 
there is a change of regime in Iraq, it will be extremely useful to 
have the opposition groups working together so Baghdad does not fall 
into chaos and anarchy,'' Fatchett said. London is a main center for 
Iraqi exile and opposition groups. At various times, the dissidents 
have succeeded in bringing together Shiite Muslim groups, former ruling 
party officials and Kurdish guerrillas who sought autonomy in northern 
Iraq. Opposition groups say they are a key source of information about 
Saddam and critical to any rebellion. One London-based group, The 
Iraqi National Accord, said this week that it has provided British 
authorities with a detailed list of Saddam's international spy network. 
The document, compiled by Saddam's private secretary, named all the 
members of Iraqi intelligence service who pose as diplomats and was 
released to the West even before it was on Saddam's desk, the group 
said in a report in London's Sunday Telegraph. ``Information like 
this is priceless in the battle to end Saddam's tyranny,'' Ayad Alawi, 
who heads the group, told the newspaper. ``It shows that often we 
know more about what is going on inside Iraq than Saddam. And the 
more we know, the more damage we can do to him.'' Alawi said Western 
support is vital. ``There is no point in the West urging Iraqis to 
overthrow Saddam if it is not prepared to help,'' he said. ``The first 
step toward getting rid of Saddam is to persuade the Iraqi people 
that they have friends and supporters outside who can help them succeed.''
