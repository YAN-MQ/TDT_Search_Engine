Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp. chairman, and his wife, Melinda, will 
give $20 million to the Seattle Public Library system on Tuesday, 
officials of the William H. Gates Foundation said Monday. The gift 
is believed to be the largest donation from individuals to a public 
library system. The donation will provide $15 million to help expand 
neighborhood libraries, $4 million to support additions to the book 
collection, and $1 million to support literacy, English as a second 
language and other programs. ``Melinda and I are supporting the Seattle 
Public Library because we hope children from across the city will 
get the same chance that we did to succeed through reading and exploring 
new ideas,'' Gates said through a spokeswoman. ``Neighborhood libraries 
are a free and wonderful place for lifelong learning.'' Gates has 
a net worth estimated at $40 billion, making him the wealthiest person 
in the United States. He has been criticized for not being more generous 
with his wealth. In 1997, he and his wife, who live in Medina, Wash., 
a suburb of Seattle, pledged $200 million to bring computers, computer 
training and Internet access to libraries in low-income areas in the 
United States and Canada. In April, they gave the New York Public 
Library $640,000 to expand public access to computers and the Internet. 
They have also given $20 million in scholarships at Duke University 
and have donated more than $17 million to the University of Washington 
for its law school and scholarships. This month Seattle residents 
passed a $196.4 million bond issue to nearly double the space of neighborhood 
libraries and build a new central library. It was the most extensive 
library capital measure undertaken by an American city, said Deborah 
Jacobs, the city librarian, who called the Gates gift ``a phenomenal 
example of generosity.'' The Seattle Public Library Foundation president, 
Jack Faris, said the gift was a call to action to other contributors 
and said that the foundation would increase its fund-raising goal 
from $40 million to $60 million. In Seattle, 80 percent of residents 
hold library cards, a higher percentage than in most other cities 
of its size.
