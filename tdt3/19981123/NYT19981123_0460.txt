In a decision supporting unfettered access to the Internet in public 
libraries, a federal judge on Monday struck down the Loudoun County, 
Va., library's policy of using filtering software on all computer 
terminals. ``Such a policy offends the guarantee of free speech in 
the First Amendment and is, therefore, unconstitutional,'' Judge Leonie 
Brinkema of the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., said in the 
decision. Judge Brinkema wrote that the use of the filters, made by 
a private company, to limit Internet access was also a form of prior 
restraint on distribution of speech and asserted that ``a defendant 
cannot avoid its constitutional obligation by contracting out its 
decision making to a private entity.'' Judge Brinkema issued a permanent 
injunction against the filtering policy, but the decision leaves unanswered 
whether it would be constitutionally acceptable to use filters on 
terminals that are set aside for children. Loudoun library officials 
made no statement about an appeal. About 15 percent of libraries have 
installed filters on at least some of their terminals, according to 
a recent survey from the American Library Association. The lawsuit 
challenging the library policy was brought late last year by a civic 
organization called Mainstream Loudoun as well as a handful of individual 
patrons. Later, publishers of eight Web sites, from a safe-sex page 
to an online publication examining ethical issues, joined the suit, 
saying their speech had been censored by the policy. All eight sites 
had been blocked at one point by the filtering software, called X-Stop, 
but were unblocked after the suit was filed, according to Ann Beeson, 
a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented 
the publishers.
