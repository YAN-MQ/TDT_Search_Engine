It's a cloudy issue -- should smoking marijuana be realized for medicinal 
purposes. A new report is trying to clear the air. The study shows 
smoking marijuana is an impracticable way to treat glaucoma, a chronic 
eye disease leading to blindness. Its an increase of pressure in the 
eye. Doctors suspect a chemical in marijuana can reduce pressure preventing 
the disease from progressing. Some doctors say patients would have 
to Meek an unrealistic amount of marijuana. They would have to smoke 
a joint every hour and a half to two hours, which is ten to 12 joints 
a day, 4,000 joints a year. Some doctors feel the Negative effects 
associated with smoking outweigh the current benefits and that patients 
would be better off using available prescription medications until 
scientists can duplicate the effects of thc in an ointment.
