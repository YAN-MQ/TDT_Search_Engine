If the thought of the holidays has you feeling stressed and short 
on time, there's a man in St. Louis who can help out with your outdoor 
decorations. Jason whiteley from our affiliate kmov has the story. 
Ready? Chris Newman probably has more holiday lights than anyone you 
know. Other than merits, I think we probably do. But all the lights 
aren't for Newman's house. This is our sixth year. We'll be doing 
about 600 customers this year. Chris has turned the holidays into 
quite a small business. 18 friends work for him. They will hire Chris 
and his crew to decorate and lights their homes for the holidays. 
I work for united parcel service. Fortunately I work in the evenings. 
That allows me to maintain both jobs. Chris says his extra job shouldn't 
take away from family tradition. If anything, he hopets it adds more 
holiday spirit. A lot of times if we don't do it, it won't get done. 
Either for time constraints or a lot of times for the elderly. Most 
houses take about an hour and a half of labor to light. The average 
home runs about 200 -- $200. It's a per-strand charge of $13 for a 
strand for anything on the house and $11 per strand for anything in 
trees or bushes. It's 1992, Newman has collected hundreds of light 
strands and tens of thousands of bulbs. Extension cords, miles and 
miles. I could go from here to Kansas city and back with one big cord. 
The number of customers always grows. Right now he has 300 places 
left to light in addition to his own home. Jason whitely, St. Louis.
