This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and 
WGBH Boston. It's Monday, November 23. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. 
Today, 16 Iraqi opposition groups huddle to discuss strategies for 
toppling Saddam Hussein, but even they acknowledge they've got a long 
way to go. I must admit that the opposition have become part of the 
problem rather than part of the solution. There's no solution in sight 
to the crisis in Russia. We'll consider U.S. policy options and remember 
a champion of Russian democracy. Also, British beef exports will be 
less rare and a global pickpocketing expert says be smart, be swift, 
be sneaky. First, this news.
