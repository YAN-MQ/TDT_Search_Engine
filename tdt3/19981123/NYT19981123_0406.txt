An appeals court on Monday overturned a light sentence in a mercy-killing 
case and ruled that a Saskatchewan farmer, Robert Latimer, must serve 
at least 10 years in prison for killing his 12-year-old daughter, 
Tracy. The tougher sentence has reopened one of the most passionately 
argued issues in Canada and made it likely that the Supreme Court 
will be put in the position of deciding difficult right-to-die issues. 
The emotionally wrenching details have already deeply divided Canadians. 
After Latimer's conviction a year ago, groups representing the disabled 
and handicapped were outraged at the two-year sentence he received 
for killing his daughter, who had a severe but not terminal case of 
cerebral palsy. They said such a light sentence cheapened the lives 
of people with illnesses or disabilities. But right-to-die groups 
saw the fact that he did not receive a heavier sentence as proof that 
current laws did not adequately reflect contemporary attitudes. Emotions 
were stirred again Monday when Saskatchewan's highest court found 
that a lower-court judge had erred last year in accepting a jury's 
plea for a reduced sentence for Latimer, 45, after he was convicted 
of second-degree murder. He could have been sentenced to life imprisonment, 
with no chance of parole for 10 years. But Judge Ted Noble of the 
Court of Queen's Bench, a provincial court, granted him a rare constitutional 
exemption and sentenced him to just two years, with half to be served 
on his farm in Wilkie, Saskatchewan. On Monday the Saskatchewan Court 
of Appeals overturned the earlier ruling and sentenced Latimer to 
life imprisonment, with at least 10 years to be served before any 
parole. He surrendered to the police and was held briefly in the jail 
in Wilkie until he was released on bail Monday evening, said his lawyer, 
Mark Brayford. Brayford said he had filed an application for appeal 
to the Supreme Court of Canada. Latimer has never denied that he killed 
Tracy in 1993 but contended that she had been in constant pain and 
her weight had dwindled to just 40 pounds.
