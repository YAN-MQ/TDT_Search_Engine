Michigan prosecutors are taking a close look at a videotape recorded 
by retired pathologist Jack Kevorkian. In it, Kevorkian gives a terminally 
ill man a lethal dose of drugs. The tape was broadcast last night 
on "60 minutes," and it's prompting strong reaction. Ed Garsten reports. 
Carole poenisch let out a Sigh of consternation as she and her husband 
watched Thomas yauk die on television after being injected with lethal 
drugs by Dr. Jack Kevorkian. As the inventor of this, he's just gone 
too far. It's something even he was against a few years ago. Poenisch 
wasn't just a casual observer. Her mother, merian Frederick, who suffered 
from Lou Gehrig's disease, committed suicide with Kevorkian's help. 
She supported her mother's decision and Kevorkian's advocacy of doctor 
assisted suicide. But now, she says, Kevorkian has crossed a line 
she can't abide by. This is wrong, this is terribly wrong to have 
to do it for the patient. Active euthanasia is wrong. Clergy in at 
least two cities spoke out in vain against CBS showing the tape and 
against active euthanasia. This is someone deliberately killing someone 
else, even though it may be at his request. It is still killing. But 
while Kevorkian once used a rube Goldberg-like contraption he called 
the suicide machine to avoid prosecution, a journalist who has had 
almost unlimited access to Kevorkian says, the so-called "suicide 
doctor" always preferred a more active role in helping people die. 
He always believed we needed what he calls active euthanasia for patients 
who are just too weak or can't swallow pills. Kevorkian was tried 
but never convicted under Michigan's old ban against assisted suicide 
that was fraught with loopholes. Now those loopholes have been closed 
under a new law, and Kevorkian wants to be arrested and charged to 
test it. He says he'll go on a hunger strike as he did in 1993 if 
he's put in jail. Armed with a tough new law and a videotape, Oakland 
county prosecutor David gorcyca still isn't ready to charge Kevorkian. 
For one, he's not sure if he has enough evidence. And two, he's not 
sure of the crime, assisted suicide or murder. Carole poenisch, once 
an ardent supporter, now believes Kevorkian may be guilty of at least 
manslaughter. But she is eternally grateful, he was there for her 
mother. Ed Garsten, CNN, northville, Michigan.
