Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and mortars at an Israeli outpost 
in southern Lebanon today, killing an Israeli soldier, Lebanese security 
officials said. An hour later, Israeli warplanes raided an area between 
the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, just north of a sector occupied 
by Israel in southern Lebanon. The Israeli jets fired at least one 
air-to-surface missile on the area, the officials said, speaking on 
customary condition of anonymity. There was no immediate word on casualties. 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility for the 
attack on the Dabshe outpost in the eastern sector of an Israeli-occupied 
enclave. A Hezbollah statement said guerrillas targeted an Israeli 
army tank at the post, scoring ``direct hits.'' The security officials 
said one Israeli soldier was killed and that others may have been 
wounded. There was no immediate comment from Israel. The Dabshe outpost 
is five miles (eight kilometers) north of Marjayoun, the main town 
in the enclave Israel has occupied since 1985. Hezbollah is fighting 
to drive out about 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 allied militiamen 
stationed in the Israeli-occupied zone. Israel maintains the occupation 
is necessary to protect its northern towns.
