Iraq said Monday it was committed to cooperating with U.N. weapons 
inspectors but again balked at giving them documents, arguing that 
opening up its archives could jeopardize its national security. Baghdad 
accused the chief U.N. weapons inspector of using the issue of the 
documents _ which it claims either don't exist, have been turned over 
or have no bearing on inspectors' work _ to prolong arms searches 
and the timing of a promised review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. 
resolutions. The new dispute comes just a week after Iraq pledged 
to fully and unconditionally cooperate with inspectors when confronted 
with what U.S. officials have said were imminent U.S. and British 
airstrikes. U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen renewed the threat 
Monday, saying the United States has ``in place in the Gulf enough 
capability to carry out any military options the president might decide 
would be required.'' Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, delivered 
an 18-page, single-spaced letter from his deputy prime minister explaining 
Iraq's position in technical detail about why the document requests 
from the U.N. Special Commission chief were unfounded. ``We don't 
have any more documents that we believe are related to disarmament 
at this point,'' Hamdoon told reporters. The letter from Tariq Aziz, 
he said, is indicative of Baghdad's frustration ``with the effort 
to change the whole work of UNSCOM from disarmament into documentation,'' 
referring to the commission responsible for disarming Iraq. Forcing 
Baghdad to open up its archives, he said, ``is something that may 
jeopardize the national security of Iraq.'' Iraq has used the sovereignty 
argument before in trying to keep inspectors at bay, and its sympathizers 
on the Security Council _ particularly Russia and China _ have generally 
supported the position. Council members won't lift sanctions imposed 
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait until U.N. weapons experts have 
certified that Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and 
the missiles to deliver them, are destroyed. Iraq has said it has 
destroyed all its banned weapons. In the letter, Tariz Aziz accused 
UNSCOM chief Richard Butler of using the issue of the documents to 
undermine a so-called ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's efforts to 
disarm itself. The council has said it won't conduct the review until 
Butler reports that he has received full cooperation from Baghdad. 
Baghdad sees a review as its best hope for a lifting of the eight-year 
U.N. oil embargo. The council agreed to a review as a way to persuade 
Iraq to resume cooperation with UNSCOM. Aziz said he found it puzzling 
that Butler could conclude that Iraq wasn't cooperating with inspectors 
when he was seeking documents that had already been turned over, or 
for which Iraq had already provided answers. ``Iraq's understanding 
of the present situation in the manner I describe here ... cannot 
by any stretch of the imagination, be described as a lack of cooperation,'' 
Aziz wrote. Iraq ended that cooperation first in August and then more 
fully on Oct. 31 _ a day after the council released a preliminary 
outline for the review that didn't refer to a lifting of the embargo 
as a possible result. Baghdad reversed its decisions on Nov. 14. Aziz 
took particular aim at Butler's request for information on its biological 
weapons program, which inspectors have long said was far from sufficient, 
saying ``no meeting of mind is possible. ``Given the gulf between 
the respective positions and the different approaches adopted, we 
concluded that the requests of the executive chairman are impossible 
to satisfy,'' Aziz wrote. He also repeated conditions Iraq placed 
on the viewing of one particular air force document detailing expended 
munitions that may have been filled with chemical and biological agents 
in the 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran. ``What this boils down to 
is less than full compliance, which is what they promised eight days 
ago,'' British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Monday. He said Iraq's 
position left the comprehensive review ''in the future.''
