The FBI has questioned and released one of two men who might have 
information about the death of abortion provider Dr. Bart slepian. 
But the search is still on for a man named James Charles kopp who 
is wanted as a material witness in the case. Gary Tuchman has more. 
Law enforcement authorities know him from his frequent anti-abortion 
protests at women's clinics. In Vermont, he locked himself under a 
car with two other protesters and was arrested. West Virginia during 
the same year he was also arrested during a protest at a clinic. In 
1991, on long island, New York, he was holding rosary beads locked 
in a 90-pound metal device with another person outside a clinic. He 
was sent to jail. Now, one month after an obstetrician/gynecologist 
who performed abortions was shot and killed by a sniper through his 
kitchen window in suburban buffalo, law enforcement authorities from 
Canada to the United States to mexico are still attempting to find 
an individual -- officially, 44-year-old James Charles kopp is not 
being called a suspect, but rather a Material witness in the death 
of Dr. Barnett slepian. But the efforts to find him are intense. He 
seemed like a devout Catholic who wanted to stop abortion but wanted 
to do it peacefully. Randall Terry is the former head of the anti-abortion 
group operation rescue. Terry was the leader of operation rescue protests 
that took place in the buffalo area back in 1992 outside Dr. slepian's 
office and the clinic where he provided abortions. Police aren't sure 
if James kopp participated in those protests, but the fBI is examining 
this 1993 videotape shot by employees of the clinic, trying to determine 
if this man is James kopp. Dr. slepian's sister is Serena Robb. If 
they apprehend anyone, I want to be at his trial, because I want to 
understand what happened. I want to understand the reason behind this, 
because right now I can't. There have been reports that kopp has recently 
been seen in places ranging from New Jersey to Mexico. But authorities 
say, frankly, they aren't sure where he is. Gary Tuchman, CNN, New 
York. We wanted to stay with that as long as I could. The audio wasn't 
sinkd up with it.
