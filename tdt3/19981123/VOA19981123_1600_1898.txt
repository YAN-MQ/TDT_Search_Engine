Russian President Boris Yeltzin's latest health problems have overshadowed 
a summit meeting with Chinese President Xan Zi Man. The two leaders 
met for less than an hour at a Moscow hospital where Mr. Yeltzin is 
recovering from pneumonia. Officials say the two men discussed bilateral 
ties and moved closer to resolving a long-running border dispute. 
VOA's Gil Butler says Mr. Yeltzin's illness is particularly untimely. 
I think that this is especially a bad time for this kind of thing 
to have happened because there's talk in the lower house of the Russian 
parliament among the Communist deputies who control the Duma that 
they want to end Mr. Yeltzin's presidency on the grounds that he can't 
perform his duties. President Yeltzin was hospitalized Sunday.
