Russian President Boris Yeltsin is facing yet another health crisis. 
He was hospitalized over the weekend with pneumonia, but the Kremlin 
says he no longer has a high temperature. As Jill Dougherty explains, 
this is the third time in recent weeks the ailing Russian leader has 
battled illness. It wasn't until the next day that Russians got the 
news their president was here -- the central clinical hospital in 
Moscow. The Kremlin gave few details, confirming only that Sunday 
night, Boris yeltsin's temperature rose to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, 
38.9 degrees centigrade. He was diagnosed with pneumonia and was being 
treated with antibiotics. As TV camera crews set up outside the hospital 
Gates, the Kremlin announced mr. Yeltsin, in spite of his illness, 
was going ahead with a planned meeting with Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin. A motorcade carrying the Chinese leader left the hospital after 
what aides said was a half-hour meeting. Yeltsin's press secretary, 
dmitri yakushkin, scheduled a news conference, but then canceled it 
with no explanation. Mr. Yeltsin's health has been noticeably failing 
since October when he stumbled and fell ill during a trip to central 
Asia. He later came down with bronchitis, and doctors ordered him 
to rest. He canceled three international trips. In late October, he 
spent more than a week recuperating in the south of russia from what 
the Kremlin described as nervous exhaustion and uneven blood pressure. 
Over the past weeks, the Kremlin has released videotape of Mr. Yeltsin 
-- some of it silent. In it, the president has moved stiffly and appeared 
pale and puffy. But these most recent bouts of illness have been different 
from two years ago when Mr. Yeltsin underwent a heart bypass operation. 
We have already started a transition to a postyelstin era, and the 
impact of Yeltsin's illness is far less than what it was last year 
or the year before. Mr. Yeltsin has turned over to his prime minister, 
Yevgeny primakov, the day-to-day running of the country. Under the 
constitution, Primakov would take over for the president if he died 
or were incapacitated. The president's opponents have tried, so far 
unsuccessfully, to force Mr. yeltsin to submit to a medical examination. 
And some have called for early elections. They're growing. Jill Dougherty, 
CNN, Moscow.
