Croatia's military observers will not watch a NATO exercise in neighboring 
Slovenia since the date for which they were invited to come ``is not 
appropriate,'' the state-run news agency HINA quoted a Foreign Ministry 
official as saying. The official, who declined to be identified, did 
not elaborate, but the Croats may have been offended because they 
were invited to come on Wednesday, the same day reporters and common 
Slovenes may watch a small part of the war games. The rest of the 
exercise is closed to outsiders. The exercise, held for the first 
time in the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, just few kilometers 
(miles) from Croatian border, lasts until Dec. 2. Croatia is eager 
to be admitted to NATO's Partnership for Peace program, but the Zagreb 
government repeatedly has been told that will happen only when it 
improves its democracy record. NATO as such has not invited Croatia 
to attend the exercise. But the Slovene Defense Ministry said five 
Croatian army officers could come on Wednesday, only to see Slovene 
participants. Up to 1,200 troops from Slovenia, which is a member 
of the Partnership for Peace program, are participating in the exercise. 
``Croatia thanked Slovenia for the invitation, but we emphasized that 
the date is not appropriate,'' the Foreign Ministry official told 
HINA.
