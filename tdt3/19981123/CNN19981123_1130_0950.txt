Stocks streak higher. For the latest numbers and financial news, let's 
go to Myron Kandel in New York. Mike? Thanks, Toria. The Dow is surging 
to within 100 points of their record high as investors continue last 
week's buying spree. Several large merger announcements also serving 
to drive stock prices higher. That's 83 points below the Dow's high 
set last July. The broader markets are also higher. The NASDAQ composite 
is up 34 points. It posted a nearly 4.5% gain last week. That bond 
has changed in the last couple of minutes. It's now down 6/32 of a 
point in price. The bond was up more than half a point a little bit 
ago.
