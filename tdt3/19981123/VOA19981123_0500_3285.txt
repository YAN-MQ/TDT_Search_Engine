Tony Bennett tells all in his new memoirs including the truth on how 
he almost literally left his heart in San Francisco. Frank Sinatra 
once called Tony Bennett the best singer in the business. He's an 
8-time Grammy winner and has recorded some 80 albums. But that apparently 
couldn't keep him happy. Somewhere between the time Tony Bennett made 
San Francisco famous in the mid-1960s and became the darling of the 
MTV generation in the '90s, he picked up a serious drug problem. In 
his new book The Good Life, the 72-year-old crooner reveals how he 
started using cocaine and marijuana shortly after he moved to Hollywood 
in the 1970s and confesses that the experience nearly killed him. 
You can read more in his new book The Good Life.
