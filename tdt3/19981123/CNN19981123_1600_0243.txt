A new report finds high school graduation rates in the United States 
are falling behind the rest of the industrialized world. The organization 
for economic cooperation and development in Paris reports that U.S. 
graduation rates are below 75%. Other countries in that range include 
Canada, Mexico and Spain. But countries like Belgium, Japan and Poland 
have rates over 93%. The report suggests U.S. rates are not necessarily 
getting worse, but other countries are getting better.
