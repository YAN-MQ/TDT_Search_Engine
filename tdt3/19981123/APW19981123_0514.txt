A bus carrying American tourists had its windows shattered when a 
group of assailants shouting anti-American slogans attacked it with 
stones and iron rods, the Iran News reported Monday. The attack is 
believed to have been triggered by reports in hardline newspapers 
accusing the visiting American group of being U.S. officials and members 
of the Central Intelligence Agency posing as tourists. The attack 
happened Saturday morning as the group arrived in front of the Esteglal 
Hotel in northern Tehran where they were staying, the paper said. 
The bus was stopped by a group of men who broke all of the buses' 
windows before the bus driver sped off to another hotel and called 
the police, the paper said. The group of 13 people then received a 
police escort to their hotel, said the Iran News. Other accounts said 
some of the Americans suffered minor injuries and cuts from flying 
glass. A radical Muslim group claiming responsibility for the attack 
had a slightly different account, saying its members threw stones 
at the tourists and injured some as they got off the bus to enter 
the hotel, the al-Hayat newspaper reported. The London-based Arabic 
daily said its office in Tehran received an anonymous phone call from 
someone speaking on behalf of the Fedayeen Islam, or ``Volunteers 
for Martyrdom for Islam,'' claiming it carried out the attack. ``This 
is a lesson and a warning to those spies,'' the paper quoted the caller 
as saying. A statement from the Fedayeen Islam also claiming responsibility 
was made available in Tehran on Monday. ``This was an operation against 
U.S. spies and a warning to the officials who invited them,'' it said, 
apparently referring to President Mohammad Khatami's call for cultural 
exchanges between Americans and Iranians. An Iranian newspaper Monday 
condemned the attack saying it went against Iran's tradition of hospitality. 
``Doesn't the attack on the bus carrying the group of tourists visiting 
Iran, the land of hospitable people, damage our Islamic and Iranian 
reputation. It gives the impression that our country is not a safe 
place and no more tourists will dare come to Iran,'' the Etelaat evening 
paper said. Groups of, 11th graf pvs
