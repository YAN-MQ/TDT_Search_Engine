As a cultural icon and a partner in The Three Tenors Inc., Luciano 
Pavarotti has been doing just fine in recent years. But his appearances 
in opera during this period have been another story, even at the Metropolitan, 
where he has sung, to date, 359 performances in 20 roles, more than 
with any other company. So, going into the Sunday afternoon gala to 
celebrate the 30th anniversary, almost to the day, of his Met debut 
(as Rodolfo in ``La Boheme''), the signs were not good. For some time 
now Pavarotti, who is 63, has been struggling vocally and coasting, 
sometimes shamelessly, on his great fame. On top of it all, this summer 
he underwent a hip replacement operation, from which he is still recuperating 
(the reason he gave for withdrawing from three scheduled performances 
of ``Tosca'' at the Met this month). But this turned out to be not 
just an occasion for acknowledging the renowned career of an indisputably 
great singer. In the ceremony following the performance, Pavarotti 
said that he had wanted in his gala to prove to himself that after 
30 years he could still sing. And that he did. The program showcased 
Pavarotti in complete acts of three operas from the three main areas 
of his repertory. He sang the bel canto role of Nemorino in Act II 
of Donizetti's ``Elisir d'Amore,'' the lirico spinto role of Rodolfo 
in Act III of ``La Boheme'' and the weightier heroic role of Radames 
in Act IV of Verdi's ``Aida.'' Understandably, his voice has faded. 
He started off tentatively in the Donizetti and sang with noticeable 
caution throughout the afternoon. He now has to negotiate high pianissimo 
phrases, which were once his glory. But he sounded fully prepared 
and determined; he paced himself well and never really faltered. There 
were moments of beautiful singing to savor, flashes of Pavarotti in 
his prime, when he combined an unsurpassable sense of language with 
an instinctive understanding of style and sheer vocal charisma. Though 
Pavarotti is still a bit shaky on his feet, he has lost considerable 
weight (at least 70 pounds, a colleague of his said) and looks fitter 
than he has in years. In ``L'Elisir,'' he even took some dance spins 
with the soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, who sang Adina. He may still be 
adjusting to the weight loss, for his voice sometimes lacked support. 
But the vocal colorings remain a marvel. His colleagues seemed palpably 
excited to be part of the occasion. Ms. Swenson was in exquisite voice. 
The soprano Daniela Dessi was Pavarotti's lovely Mimi in ``La Boheme.'' 
And one hopes the heated lovers' quarrel that Dwayne Croft as Marcello 
and Ainhoa Arteta as Musetta enacted in the final quartet was not 
based on real-life experience: the couple were married last year. 
Maria Guleghina stepped in on short notice as Aida for the indisposed 
Aprile Millo. In the earlier trial scene, the powerhouse mezzo-soprano 
Dolora Zajick smoldered through the music of Amneris, spurring Pavarotti 
on to his most impassioned singing and winning herself a frenzied 
ovation. James Levine, who has given Pavarotti solid support over 
their years together at the Met, conducted with his customary excellence. 
Afterward, during a ceremony onstage, Levine; the Met general manager, 
Joseph Volpe; all the participants, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani 
led the tribute, while a grateful audience roundly ignored the Met's 
ban on flash photography. There will be no 35th-anniversary gala at 
the Met for Pavarotti; that seems sure. Even his close colleague Joan 
Sutherland has suggested publicly that it would be wise for him to 
retire. Still, if a young tenor arrived tomorrow sounding as he did 
Sunday, we would all be proclaiming a great new voice on the scene.
