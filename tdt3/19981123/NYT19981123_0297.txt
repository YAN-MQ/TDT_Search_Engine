NATIONAL FORECAST Cooler air will extend from the Ohio Valley to the 
Northeastern and Middle Atlantic States on Tuesday in the wake of 
a cold front that will move off the East coast early Tuesday morning. 
However, temperatures will still average near to slightly above normal 
in most places. Scattered snow showers will affect the mountains of 
northern New England, but it will be mainly dry and tranquil elsewhere 
as high pressure takes control. A moist disturbance will drift across 
northern Florida with batches of showers and some thunderstorms over 
the peninsula. Meanwhile, residual moisture will cause clouds, patchy 
showers and spotty drizzle to linger near the Southeast coast. Light 
winds will cover the interior Southeast from Georgia to eastern Texas 
where areas of low clouds and fog will be slow to break. Low pressure 
starved for moisture will produce spotty rain showers over the far 
northern Plains. Otherwise it will be quite mild in the Plains, with 
afternoon highs 10 to 15 degrees above normal. Moist winds from the 
Pacific will blow across the Northwest and northern Rockies on Tuesday, 
but only patchy showers are expected through Tuesday afternoon. Snow 
will accumulate a few more inches in the mountains. However, another 
surge of heavy rain and very strong winds will reach the coast on 
Tuesday night, as the latest in a series of potent storm systems arrives. 
Meanwhile, sinking air currents will lead to ample sunshine and pleasant 
temperatures from southern California to parts of western Texas. Focus: 
Squall Line A line of squally thunderstorms charged across the Oregon 
coast early Monday. Such a formidable ``squall line'' is unusual in 
the Pacific Northwest. Typically, tempestuous lines of thunderstorms 
precede strong cold fronts in the eastern states as very warm and 
humid air near the surface is rapidly lifted by upper-level disturbances. 
In the Pacific Northwest, the combination of very warm and humid air 
rarely occurs, owing to the influence of cool Pacific waters. On Monday, 
lifting by a powerful upper-level disturbance overcame the lack of 
humid warmth, igniting a line of fierce storms.
