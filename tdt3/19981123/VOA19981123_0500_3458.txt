Oh, don't you just wish it could go on forever? Well, unfortunately, 
it can't. Many of our local F.M. and medium-wave affiliates are about 
to take a short break, but we'll be back on VOA News Now. By golly, 
I think it's at the start of prohibition, President Warren G. Harding 
signed into law a measure that closed one loophole and provided some 
legal alcohol to Americans. I think after you tell me this, Les. to 
shut down the rapidly-growing market in alleged medical cures that 
contained a lot of alcohol. Now some of these so-called cures were 
being bought and sold as alcoholic beverages. Under the terms of the 
laws enforcing prohibition, physicians could prescribe certain medicines 
containing alcohol but very doctors were actually doing so. The new 
law also forbade -- I like that word -- physicians from prescribing 
beer for medical purposes. Whoa, that's like my Aunt May, you know. 
Anyway, the constitutional bank on alcoholic beverages in the U.S. 
lasted until December 5, 1933, when the states ratified the 21st Amendment 
which repealed the 18th, or prohibition, amendment. Les, I think you 
got consumption, so why don't you... Let's have a drink. ... why don't 
you go out and consume something alcoholic? Coming up on 11 hours 
Universal time. We now say goodbye to listeners in the Americas until 
midnight Universal time when VOA News Now resumes on 5995, 613, 7405, 
9455, 9775, 11695 and 1374 megahertz. The VOA News Now continues on 
5985, 611, 9645, 976, 11705, 1170 -- or 1172 and 15425 megahertz short-wave. 
There's going to be a quiz. Stay tuned. It's 11 hours Universal time, 
and from Washington, this is VOA News Now.
