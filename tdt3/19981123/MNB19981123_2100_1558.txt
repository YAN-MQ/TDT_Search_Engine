A verdict today for Susan McDougal, a Los Angeles jury found the Whitewater 
figure and Clinton family friend not guilty of embezzlement. She was 
acquitted on all counts after charged with steeling $50,000 from conductor 
zubin mehta and his wife. She spent 18 months in jail. She claims 
charges of embezzlement were trumped up against her to get her to 
testify against President Clinton.
