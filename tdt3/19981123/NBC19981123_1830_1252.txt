Health news this everyone can relate to, a new study on stress on 
the job. You may not realize how damaging your work can be to your 
health. Here's Robert Bazell. High-stress jobs -- you think they raise 
your blood pressure -- and the study out today shows that many jobs 
do, by an astounding amount. How much? An average of 11 points. It 
was equivalent to the effect of aging 25 years or putting on 50 pounds 
of weight. And that can have terrible health consequences. Over time, 
it will significantly increase the risk of having a heart attack, 
and to even greater extent, of having a stroke. But you may be surprised 
to learn that it isn't the feeling of stress or pressure that raises 
blood pressure. It's something scientists call job strain that 30% 
of Americans suffer on the job. So what exactly is job strain? It's 
combination of two factors -- feeling overworked and having little 
or no control over how you do your job. For example, people on an 
assembly line, forced to work fast with no say over how products get 
made, postal workers sorting huge amounts of mail, and mid-level mangers 
who have a lot of responsibility but little control in how things 
get done. We have our own region initiatives. Angelo vassallo was 
one of those middle-level managers for a Liquor manufacturer. He had 
very high blood pressure, until he got a promotion. I had to accomplish 
a couple of key things which made me feel good. And I feel much more 
in control of what I'm doing. Today his blood pressure is way down. 
And millions of Americans could also benefit if their working conditions 
changed. I think we need to talk about reorganizing work to increase 
people's control and say over the work process. a difficult challenge, 
to be sure, but critical because today's study shows that work contributes 
far more than we ever knew to life-threatening high blood pressure 
in America. Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
