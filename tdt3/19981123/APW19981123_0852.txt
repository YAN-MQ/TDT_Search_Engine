Albania's fiery opposition leader on Monday urged supporters to ``fill 
the streets of Tirana'' to protest the government's apparent victory 
in persuading voters to back a Western-style constitution. The call 
of Sali Berisha, a key figure both in September rioting in the capital 
and prolonged unrest last year, raised fears of renewed violence. 
By dusk Monday, about 2,000 people chanting anti-government slogans 
peacefully filled downtown Skanderbeg Square _ the scene of rioting 
and gunfire after the September assassination of Azem Hajdari, a prominent 
member of Berisha's Democratic Party. Earlier Monday, his voice at 
a near scream, a fist-waving Berisha accused the government of voting 
fraud and intimidation in Sunday's referendum meant to give Europe's 
poorest nation its first post-communist Constitution. His voice at 
a near scream, Berisha accused the government of voting fraud and 
intimidation in Sunday's referendum meant to give Europe's poorest 
nation its first post-communist Constitution. ``I call on everybody 
in Tirana to take to the streets in self defense,'' Berisha said. 
The Constitution is meant to give citizens the right to legally change 
their religion and to identify themselves as members of an ethnic 
minority. Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' 
and predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant religion, 
to avoid discrimination while working in richer, non-Muslim neighbors 
such as Greece. The constitution also defines property rights and 
lets the government expropriate land deemed of national interest. 
Critics say the expropriation clause smacks of communism. On his way 
out of a hotel, Berisha ran into members of the European Parliament 
who observed the vote. ``The government violated the process, and 
the people will go out on the streets and show them that is very serious,'' 
Berisha shouted at them. Officials of the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, which oversaw the balloting, said the referendum 
was relatively incident-free and voter turnout was higher than expected 
consider a steady rain and a boycott call by Berisha. Albania's Central 
Voting Committee said Monday more than 50 percent of voters participated. 
The committee said it may take a few days to receive turnout results 
and ballot boxes from remote regions, delaying referendum results. 
Berisha disputed the committee's figures, saying no more than 38 percent 
of the population voted and accused the government of rigging the 
elections. Months of political violence last year led to early elections 
that spelled defeat for Berisha and forced his resignation as president. 
Violence fomented by Berisha supporters paralyzed the country again 
earlier this year.
