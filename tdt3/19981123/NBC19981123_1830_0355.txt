Still ahead tonight -- a very public death. "In depth." Has Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian finally gone too far? It appeared a homicide was committed 
in violation of the laws of the state of Michigan. Kevorkian testing 
the limits again, this time in front of millions of television viewers. 
And later, stress on the job. A new study shows it could actually 
threaten your life. Sorry I'm late. I was at my doctor and-- oh, did 
you ask her about the things we've been reading about menopause? I 
did. She said... it's important to consider menopause... and the consequences 
of its associated estrogen loss. You mean, like hot flashes? Hot flashes 
and night sweats. But other things too. Like vaginal dryness. It can 
interfere with intimacy. And osteoporosis. I know that menopause... 
increases our risk for fractures. Dr. Hartman also said... studies 
show that menopause contributes to heart disease in women. Additional 
ongoing studies are investigating... the connection between menopause 
and Alzheimer's disease, colon cancer, blindness and tooth loss. I 
had no idea. My doctor and I decided... to stick with the program 
we've agreed on for years. I should speak to my doctor. When considering 
menopause, consider the entire body of evidence. Speak to your doctor 
about what you can do... to help protect your health during and after 
menopause. Ice is being I know a place... American's love scenery. 
We can't get enough of it we don't care how far it is... we want to 
see it all. Good thing there's Chevy Malibu. A car designed to take 
us anywhere and back. It'll actually go up to 100,000 miles before 
its first scheduled tuneup. That's a lot of vacations. and a lot of 
souvenirs. So take the long way home. It's the car you knew America 
could build. Malibu. Genuine Chevrolet. I'll take you there.
