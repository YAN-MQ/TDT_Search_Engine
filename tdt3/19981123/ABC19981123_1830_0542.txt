Let's go back to the weapons debate. The state department spokesman 
said today the 12 sets of documents which the United Nations wants 
are important. ABC's John McWethy reports from the Pentagon on that 
debate. The arguments made by Iraq do not impress U.S. officials or 
lower suspicion. If Iraq had not spent the last six or seven years 
denying access, denying cooperation, refusing documents and engaged 
in a pattern of deceit, they wouldn't find themselves in a situation 
where the Burden of proof is on them. Here's an example of American 
suspicions, the so-called air force document, an Iraqi log of how 
many poison gas artillery shells it used during its war with Iran 
during the 1980s. The number shown on this log is 6,000 shells, fewer 
than Iraq later told the U.N. it used. If the log is correct, it means 
the U.N. must now search for 6,000 shells or get a satisfactory explanation. 
Iraq says it will show the U.N. only part of the document. As for 
the other 11 documents the U.N. wants, including diaries of military 
officers and engineers, minutes of meetings, Iraq claims most have 
been destroyed or lost. "The dog ate my homework" is not an excuse 
that's acceptable. But is it sufficient grounds to launch air strikes? 
The answer appears to be, no, not yet, anyway. I think we have to 
look at the full spectrum of their level of cooperation. The key is 
whether Iraq cooperates with the U.N.'s most aggressive type of surprise 
inspections. Those are expected to begin in two or three weeks. American 
officials say those inspections are worth waiting for. If Iraq cooperates, 
such inspections might uncover crucial new information. John McWethy, 
ab, the Pentagon.
