The American soprano Constance Hauman has immersed herself in the 
cabaret and operatic music of composers who fled the Nazis in the 
1930s and wound up in Los Angeles working in the movie business. Theirs 
is a story of lives tragically disrupted and of artists forced to 
adapt their talents to commercial American tastes. To present the 
music, and the story, Ms. Hauman has created a multimedia concert 
called ``Exiles in Paradise,'' which she performed on Saturday night 
at the 92nd Street Y. But, for all the research and effort involved, 
the presentation was curiously muddled. On one level, the event was 
a concert of cabaret songs and operetta arias by composers with lasting 
legacies, like Schoenberg, Weill and Korngold, and by others whose 
ultimate achievement was thwarted by the havoc of their exiles, like 
Frederick Hollander, Emmerich Kalman, Walter Jurmann and Eric Zeisl 
(who, for example, would later write the score for the 1943 movie 
``Lassie Come Home''). Interspersed between the songs, Ms. Hauman 
provided commentary on the rise of the Nazis and the fascist crackdown 
on German culture. In addition, there was a montage of film clips 
(``The Blue Angel,'' ``San Francisco,'' Leni Riefenstahl's ``Olympiad'') 
and video, slide and film collages conceived by Ms. Hauman and created 
by Richard Baim and Louis Klahr. The background information was useful. 
But the music and the effect of Ms. Hauman's singing were overwhelmed 
by the visual imagery, some of which was powerful though familiar 
(goose-stepping troops, Hitler taking Paris), some of which was trite 
(the surrealistic film collages). Moreover, a major element that distinguishes 
cabaret from other vocal music is the primacy of words, and in this 
regard, Ms. Hauman's decision to perform many of the songs in German 
without translations was unhelpful. And when she sang in English translation, 
her diction was often unclear. Obviously, providing printed texts 
would have diluted the dramatic effect she was after in the darkened 
hall. But it would have been inconceivable to, say, Schoenberg, that 
anyone listening to his ``Brettl-Lieder'' would not understand the 
words. Ms. Hauman knows the style of this music, but her voice, though 
strong, was occasionally tremulous and harsh in tone. She was much 
better when she scaled back her sound for songs like Eisler's ``To 
Those Who Come After.'' Her pianist, William Vendice, played with 
stamina and elegance. Ultimately, however, this was a jumbled context 
in which to hear some fascinating music.
