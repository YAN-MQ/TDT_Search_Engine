Moving with a nervousness and stealth exhibited only by lawmakers 
about to grant themselves a pay raise, the state Assembly on Monday 
voted to establish a commission to review the salaries of all three 
branches of state government, including the Legislature itself. It 
is common for elected officials across the country to distance themselves 
from measures to increase their own pay, because they fear that political 
opponents might use the issue against them in future elections. In 
New Jersey, a state with high property taxes and a volatile electorate, 
some representatives grow downright twitchy when discussing the issue. 
Last year, New Jersey officials asked a retiring state senator to 
propose a pay increase during a late-night session, but it was eventually 
killed in the Assembly. This year, legislators decided to create a 
commission to provide themselves political cover. That way, they can 
insist they are motivated not by their own salaries, but by concern 
that the state's judges are adequately paid. Although many of the 
state's 120 legislators say they work an average of 50 hours a week 
on government affairs, their offices are considered part-time positions, 
and pay $35,000 a year. That salary, which was last increased in 1990, 
ranks as the 14th highest state legislature salary in the nation. 
But some tax watchdog groups said lawmakers are already amply paid 
for their public service. ``For a part-time job, these people are 
making more than the average salary of most full-time employees in 
New Jersey,'' said John Budzash, founder of the Hands Across New Jersey 
tax relief organization. ``I don't think they should get a raise until 
we see the salaries of most New Jersey workers go up first.'' In a 
vote without any debate, the Assembly passed the measure, 64-8. But 
a sponsor of the bill, Assemblyman Leonard Lance, a Republican, said 
there was no guarantee that the panel would recommend a raise for 
legislators. ``This is not a pay-raise commission, it's a salary commission,'' 
Lance said. ``I have no idea what it will recommend. Maybe it will 
conclude that things should stay as they are. I just want to be certain 
that the quality of our judges remains high.'' A similar measure will 
be introduced in the Senate next month, according to the Republican 
majority leader, John Bennett, who is a co-sponsor. If, as expected, 
it passes, Gov. Christie Whitman, Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz 
and legislative leaders would appoint the seven commissioners. Any 
recommended salary changes would have to be approved by the Legislature 
and the governor and would not take effect until Jan. 1, 2000, after 
the next election. New Jersey judges are paid $110,000 per year. Whitman's 
salary is set at $130,000, but she accepts only $85,000 because her 
predecessor, Jim Florio, refused to accept a pay raise that was approved 
before he took office.
