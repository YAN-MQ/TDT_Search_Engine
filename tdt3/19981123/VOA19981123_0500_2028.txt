Iraq and Chief U.N. Arms Inspector Richard Butler will take their 
argument over military documents to the U.N. Security Council today. 
Iraq's U.N. Envoy Nizar Homdum says Mr. Butler is demanding documents 
that were destroyed by the 1991 Gulf war so that he can justify a 
U.S. military strike against Iraq for not cooperating with U.N. arms 
inspectors. Those documents are not existent. Cooperation has been 
extended. The teams are received in Baghdad. The sites that they wanted 
to visit are being visited. More teams could come up. Mr. Butler could 
go to Baghdad at some point and sit down and work out the different 
files. Comprehensive review could come later. The question of missing 
papers is not -- should be in -- not an issue that has to do with 
any non-compliance or non-cooperation. I don't see it that's way -- 
that way. Ambassador Homdum was asked why they called Mr. Butler's 
request on Friday provocative and unprofessional rather than simply 
saying the documents do not exist. Well, I based on our past experience 
with Mr. Butler and his commission. This was our understanding, and 
this was, I think, everybody's else understanding the last few days 
that something would have to come up on part in order to try to push 
Iraq around and try to create a pretext that could be useful to military 
land that has already been invaded, you see. Ambassador Homdum says 
the problem is a lack of trust on both sides of the weapons inspection 
issue. Regular involvement on the part of the part of the U.N. secretary 
general and the security council, he says, might bridge that gap. 
Mr. Butler says the documents on Iraq's chemical and biological weapons 
do exist, and his inspectors need them to figure out where to look 
for banned weapons. Mr. Butler did request today's U.N. Security Council 
meeting to discuss the standoff.
