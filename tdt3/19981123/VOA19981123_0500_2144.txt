One member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is very outspoken 
about what the United States should do in Iran -- in Iraq, I should 
say -- is Republican Sen. Richard Lugar who says the latest standoff 
will require strong action when President Clinton returns from his 
Asia trip. Yes, I think there will be because it's apparent, I believe 
-- it was apparent last week that Saddam Hussein is not going to cooperate. 
Iraq wants to retain these weapons of mass destruction. That's sort 
of the reason for being of Saddam. He is not only a dictator who has 
the potential to produce these weapons, but the political will to 
use them. And until the world gets that straight, really through all 
of our heads, we're going to be in difficulty. This is a menace not 
only to the area but to the security of the United States. Sen. Lugar 
says as long as Saddam Hussein and his regime remain in power, it 
is a direct threat to the United States. He says military force, including 
the use of ground forces, should not be ruled out.
