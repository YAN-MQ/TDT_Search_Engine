A high-ranking United Nations human rights investigator has arrived 
in Nigeria to inspect the government's efforts to repair and improve 
its human rights record. VOA correspondent John Pittman reports from 
our West Africa bureau. The investigator, Stolli Surabge, was invited 
to Nigeria by military ruler Gen. Abdul Sallame Abuvakar. Since taking 
office in June after the sudden death of his predecessor Gen. Stonne 
Abacha, Gen. Abuvakar has made improving Nigeria's human rights image 
a top priority. Under Gen. Abacha's rule, the Nigerian government 
jailed hundreds of political dissidents using a decree which allowed 
police to detain suspects indefinitely without trial. Many other political 
opponents were forced into exile by the government's repressive tactics 
which reached a low point in 1995 when it ordered the execution of 
the Ulgoni playwright Ken Sarawewa along with eight other activists. 
In the 6 months since Gen. Abacha's death, Gen. Abuvakar has released 
most of the prisoners jailed by his predecessor and has talked about 
repealing the detention decree which is known as Decree No. 2. Gen. 
Abuvakar has also led a democratic transition program which he has 
promised will end in May with the complete handover of power to a 
civilian government. While the visit by the U.N. human rights investigator 
is a chance for Gen. Abuvakar to show off his accomplishments, human 
rights groups say the visit will also be an opportunity to press Gen. 
Abuvakar to release a handful of prisoners who remain in jail and 
to set a specific date for abolishing Decree No. 2. The United Nations 
appointed a special refortor for human rights in Nigeria last year, 
but Mr. Surabghe was prevented from entering the country while Gen. 
Abacha was still alive. During his visit, Mr. Surabghe is scheduled 
to meet with Gen. Abuvakar and several other government officials 
as well as with human rights activists in Lagos and the capital, Obuja. 
He will also visit the northern cities of Khano and Kaduna and the 
southern city of Port Hartcourt, which is where Mr. Sarawewa was executed.
