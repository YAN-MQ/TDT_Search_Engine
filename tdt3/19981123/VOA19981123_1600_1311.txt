And football of a different sort. North of the U.S. border, Mark McLaughlin 
had kicked a game-winning field goal as time expired to make the Calgary 
Stampeders the champions in Canadian football. Calgary defeated the 
Hamilton Tigercats 26-24 Sunday in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to claim the 
Grey Cup title. McLaughlin's score was one of four successful field 
goals that he kicked during the championship game. That's sports.
