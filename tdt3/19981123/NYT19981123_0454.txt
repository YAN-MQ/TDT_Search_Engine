Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, has given his first substantial 
interview to Diane Sawyer of the ABC News magazine program ``20/20,'' 
which will broadcast an hourlong program on Starr and the investigation 
of President Clinton. Ms. Sawyer interviewed Starr on Saturday in 
Washington, and also interviewed three prosecutors who work for him, 
in an office often criticized for apparent leaks of information to 
the press. ``We will see some of the faces of these people who have 
been called his pit bulls,'' Ms. Sawyer said Monday. She said there 
had been no ground rules for the interview, but added, ``There are 
obviously certain areas he can't go into, like, is he going to indict 
the president.'' The program is scheduled to be broadcast on Wednesday 
at 10 p.m. Starr is the second major figure in the Lewinsky matter 
to be captured by ABC News. Monica Lewinsky agreed this month to an 
interview with Ms. Sawyer's colleague, Barbara Walters, that is scheduled 
to be broadcast sometime next year. Ms. Sawyer asked Starr for his 
personal views on extramarital sex and about Clinton, questioned him 
about why certain portions of his report to Congress were so graphically 
detailed and about whether ``the country has a sense of proportion 
that he doesn't have,'' she said. ``We tackle the subject of where 
politics and strict letter-of-the-law issues intersect,'' she said. 
``In a sense, it's where they collide.''
