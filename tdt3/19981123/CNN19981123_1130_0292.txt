Chicago police are searching for the bodies of more victims of serial 
killer John Wayne gacy. Today's search will focus on the parking lot 
of a building where gacy's mother once lived. It comes two decades 
after police found the remains of 33 victims buried under gacy's house. 
Police say new evidence prompted the search. They're using a type 
of ground-scanning radar and may excavate if they find something. 
Gacy was executed in 1994.
