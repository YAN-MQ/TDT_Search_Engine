President Clinton stopped in the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam on 
the last leg of an Asia tour that also took him to Japan and South 
Korea. In an address Monday, Mr. Clinton announced a package of initiatives 
for the island including the return of thousands of acres of unused 
federal land. Four years ago, I was proud to sign Congressman Underwood's 
bill to return 3,200 acres of military land. I will see to it that 
the land is transferred to Guam as soon as possible. And I happy to 
announce that we are also working to turn over another 7,300 acres 
including the former Naval Air Station and Ship Repair Facility. Mr. 
Clinton now travels to Washington with a brief stop in Hawaii.
