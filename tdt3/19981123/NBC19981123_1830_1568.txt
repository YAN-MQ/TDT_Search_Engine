Tonight the "fleecing of America" and once again the old rules are 
the best -- If it sounds too good to be true, well, you know the rest. 
In this case, it's that frantic offer to help you take advantage of 
government auctions. Great merchandise, rock-bottom prices. Right. 
Here's NBC's Dan Lothian. For sale -- cars seized from criminals or 
government surplus stock, going, going to the highest bidder. 4, 54. 
a government auction in New York. The prices are good, but contrary 
to the myth of government auctions -- A person can get a deal, but 
they're not going to get a steal. 9100. You're the Buyer for $9,100. 
Auction veterans say, in fact, the gavel rarely falls on a sale less 
than fair market value. Yet the government says, unscrupulous companies 
have created the myth of deals "too good to be true" at government 
auctions -- the promise of unbelievable and irresistible deals. Like 
a $350 Porsche. Even a large house for pennies on the dollar. Companies 
offering what some people are calling a "fleecing of America." You've 
been taken for a scam. It's just not true. Troy harbour saw a great 
deal in a newspaper ad. That lead him to a $150 auction "how to" guide, 
but the government gives away similar information free on the Internet 
and elsewhere. You're going to be taken. Second I'd like the people 
stopped. I'd like my money back. Now, a crackdown on those guide companies. 
Like productive marketing in Santa Barbara, California. Under investigation, 
its office equipment and files seized last week. There's no intent 
to mislead or misrepresent to any consumers and if it needs to be 
changed in order to comply with the law, that will be done. Authorities 
say thousands of people nationwide are fleeced by companies that pull 
in millions of dollars each year. Don't be misguided by offers that 
sound too good to be true. Even if they are advertising your dream 
car. As far as coming in with $500 and thinking you're going to drive 
away with a new Mercedes like that one we looked at over there? That's 
not going to happen. The Mercedes did sell, for $7,100. That's a fair 
price for that car. And here's a fair warning. The government says 
if the company guides you to a steal, then in all likelihood, find 
up with a bad deal. Another "fleecing of America." Dan Lothian, NBC 
news, Los Angeles.
