And the International Amateur Athletic Federation will take up a proposal 
to scrap all existing world records and start fresh in the new century. 
The federation will consider the idea at its council meeting next 
year in Seville, Spain. If accepted, the year's best performances 
of 1999 will be recognized as world records beginning January 1 in 
the year 2000. That's sports. I'm Ray Cougal.
