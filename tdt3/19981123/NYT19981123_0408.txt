A day later, Giants Coach Jim Fassel did not try to sell Sunday's 
20-0 victory over Philadelphia as anything more than progress for 
a team that had been adrift. But Fassel was not letting go of what 
worked for his team against the Eagles either. Fassel affirmed his 
support of the new starting quarterback, Kent Graham, and surprisingly 
intimated that Graham could not lose his job even with a subpar performance 
against the San Francisco 49ers Monday night. Fassel also called the 
rookie wide receiver Joe Jurevicius, who had a coming out party of 
sorts against the Eagles, the future of the team. And Fassel insisted 
that the Giants would have to rely heavily on the running game as 
they did against the hapless Eagles, even if the opponent is San Francisco, 
which went into this past weekend's games as the National Football 
League's sixth-best team against the run. ``We are what we are,'' 
Fassel said. ``That's how we have to play and that's fine. We haven't 
broken a lot of long runs but that's how it's going to be. Last year, 
we would wear people down. We'd win with a punishing-style running 
game.'' The Giants did run for 123 yards against the Eagles Sunday, 
but the noteworthy plays _ at least as they related to the attention-grabbing 
quarterback change _ were long pass plays from Graham to Jurevicius 
and Amani Toomer. Fassel and Graham were asked Monday to explain why 
Jurevicius and Toomer, who have been generally underused this season, 
were suddenly getting more chances. Fassel and Graham said it was 
not because Graham was more used to working with the second-string 
receivers like Jurevicius and Toomer, though on Sunday Graham admitted 
that he was a little less familiar with the starting receivers, Chris 
Calloway and Ike Hilliard. ``The balls went to where the coverage 
dictated,'' Fassel said. ``That's how the game shakes out.'' Left 
unsaid was that Danny Kanell, whom Graham replaced, had become predictable, 
rarely looking beyond Calloway and Hilliard, even if the play called 
for him to turn toward Jurevicius or Toomer if Calloway and Hilliard 
were covered. Among the most significant mistakes Kanell made in his 
last start was throwing into double coverage and rushing his decision-making 
so that downfield receivers were not given proper consideration. Graham 
threw the ball downfield to Jurevicius for a 59-yard gain after scrambling 
out of the pocket. He found Toomer for a 25-yard pass play after reading 
a Philadelphia blitz. Of course, against the Eagles, who fell to 2-9, 
it may have been easier for Graham to have the time to consider all 
his options. Playing in San Francisco will clearly present a different 
set of problems. In their last four games in San Francisco, the Giants 
have not scored a touchdown, even though they won one of those games 
_ the 15-12 victory in the 1991 National Football Conference championship 
game. But Fassel is undeterred. ``I think we'll go after them confidently,'' 
the coach said of the 49ers. ``I believe that.'' On the subject of 
Graham's effort and progress, Fassel was generally positive. ``I think 
Kent played a solid game,'' he said. ``I think he did a good job.'' 
When asked what it would take for Graham to lose his starting status, 
Fassel said the criterion was much the same as it was for Kanell _ 
Graham would have to appear to lose confidence, something that negatively 
affected his decision-making. Asked whether he thought Graham could 
regress that much one game later _ in other words, if Graham could 
lose his job in San Francisco _ Fassel answered: ``He could. That's 
a small chance. I've seen it happen, but talking realistically, you're 
talking about more than one game.'' Graham said he did not know what 
it would take for him to hold his job. ``If we keep winning, that 
would probably be enough,'' he said with a smile. ``Otherwise, Jim 
hasn't told me anything different than what he's said publicly. That's 
the way I figure it's going to be. ``I look at the Eagles' game as 
one step, but obviously I can play a lot better. I know I'll have 
to be considering the test we've got this week.'' Jurevicius enjoyed 
the aftermath of his first two-reception game with the Giants, although 
he knew he would be reminded that he had also dropped two passes. 
``I see it as a 50-50 game,'' Jurevicius, the team's second-round 
pick, said. ``I did some things right, did some things wrong. Overall, 
I think that's uncharacteristic of me. I can play without the mistakes.'' 
Fassel agreed. ``I like Joe,'' he said. ``He's a guy that is the future 
around here. He's a young guy that can develop and go on. He's prone 
to young mistakes, which is fine, but you can see that he played a 
good game and is improving. That's what matters.''
