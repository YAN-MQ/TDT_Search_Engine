The man known as Carlos the Jackal has ended a prison hunger strike 
after 20 days at the request of a radical Palestinian leader, his 
lawyer said Monday. The Venezuelan-born Ilich Ramirez Sanchez had 
gone on a hunger strike Nov. 3 to protest his treatment in prison. 
He began drinking water again nine days later. On Monday, his lawyers 
released a letter to Ramirez from George Habash, head of the radical 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. In the letter, translated 
by the lawyers, Habash says: ``I shake your hands, full of hope that 
you will remain a solid international militant. ``This necessitates 
that you stay alive and in good health, to be able to continue together 
the fight for the noble cause that is ours.'' Ramirez ``responded 
that he accepted the request of Dr. Habash, which he considered an 
order, as a result of the respect that he accords him,'' said the 
statement by Ramirez's attorney, Isabelle Coutant Peyre. The decision 
to end the hunger strike was also a result of a request by Ramirez's 
parents in Venezuela, the lawyer said. Ramirez, 49, is serving a life 
term at La Sante prison. He has been in solitary confinement since 
French agents caught him in Khartoum, Sudan, on Aug. 15, 1994, then 
hauled him to Paris in a sack. He was convicted last December of the 
murders of two French investigators and a Lebanese national, and is 
under investigation for four terrorist attacks in France. Despite 
his hunger strike, Ramirez remained prolific, writing to lawyers, 
the press and even to Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei.
