Two of the world's largest Internet companies are talking marriage 
-- America Online and Netscape confirmed today that they're discussing 
a merger big enough to worry industry giant Microsoft. We get details 
now from Patrick O'Connell at our business desk in New York. The deal 
would be worth around $4 billion. If it goes through, it would combine 
AOL Internet services with Netscape's browser technology to create 
a giant drawing on millions of users. Don Wilmot from PC magazine 
explains where it may leave the computer user. There are currently 
about eight or nine portals jockeying for eyeballs, as we say in the 
business. And certainly, this is just going to make AOL a more potent 
competitor. But you know, in the end, I think the backstage deal-making 
doesn't matter to the consumer as much as a useful and efficient experience 
once they get onto the Web. Most of AOL's subscribers are within the 
United States, so I mean, does this make a splash internationally 
either by what it may presage in the future or by any of the names 
who are involved now? Well, I think Netscape has a much more international 
presence than AOL does. So the two of them together should be able 
to do much better in raising awareness of both their products. I think 
all the portals depend upon the fact that it's an international experience. 
Even a big shopping site like Amazon says 20 percent of their ordering 
comes from outside the U.S. I mean, it's an advantage of the Web that 
you don't need to be, you know, where the source is. You can get at 
it from anywhere. America Online already operates in 58 cities in 
North America, has around 14 million subscribers and operates internationally 
in Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia. The deal could add considerable 
power to its penetration of the European market. And by drawing together 
some of Microsoft's biggest rivals, including Sun Microsystems, analysts 
believe it could make more of a significant threat for Microsoft.
