Israel's foreign minister and trade minister held talks with Crown 
Prince Hassan and other officials Monday aimed at bolstering economic 
ties with Jordan. The meetings by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and 
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky follow talks in Jerusalem last week 
by Jordan, the Palestinians and Israel during U.S. Commerce Secretary 
William Daley's visit to encourage regional economic cooperation. 
Government officials, who spoke under customary condition of anonymity, 
said the Middle East peace process would be discussed during the Israelis' 
meetings, along with Jordan's long-standing complaints about Israeli 
obstacles to trade. Jordanian has repeatedly accused Israel of imposing 
unnecessarily stringent security measures that hinder the flow of 
goods between Jordan and the West Bank, as well as export of Jordanian 
goods into the Israeli market. Jordan's trade volume with the Palestinian 
territories for 1997 stood at 35 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 49 
million), of which only 12.1 million dinars (dlrs 17 million) were 
Jordanian exports. Israel exports dlrs 2.5 billion annually to Palestinians. 
Sharon and Sharansky arrived by helicopter and were expected to return 
to Israel later Monday.
