Thank you. CBS NBC's Ron Insana on the reasons for the record setting 
day. Much more ahead as we continue. As weapons inspectors face defiance 
again from Iraq, a look at U.S. policy. Who controls it? From "dateline 
NBC," loyalty to the boss can have a price. The world knows what happened 
to Betty Currie. Tonight a Ward of warning. Plus our first look at 
the newsweeklies. y or D now a story of life and death. John was brilliant. 
We'll miss his brilliant conversations. John knew everything. We'll 
miss his knowledge. John wrote that consolidated contract. He didn't 
even tell us where he put it. Now they're really consumed with grief. 
If only they knew John scanned all of his documents... into the Xerox 
document center. He made them digital and put every last one of them 
on the company website. I wonder what John would do in this situation. 
He'd check your website to see if the Xerox document center... scanned 
in the consolidated contract. Hey, I just had a thought. Oh, there's 
a good place to start. You don't think John scanned the contract into 
the, uh, the-- the Xerox document center. Xerox document center, do 
you? John was smart, but he wasn't that smart. Ooohhh! I don't think 
John liked that.
