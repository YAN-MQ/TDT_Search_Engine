With the holidays approaching, a parents group called the "lion and 
lamb project" is issuing a warning about toys it says promote violence. 
The group released a "dirty dozen" list today, identifying 12 toys 
it considers particularly worrisome. Executive director daphne white 
told a Washington news conference some of the toys include graphic 
portrayals that she described as "Blood-splattered." She said other 
toys on the list encourage simulations of violence that children may 
fail to distinguish from reality.
