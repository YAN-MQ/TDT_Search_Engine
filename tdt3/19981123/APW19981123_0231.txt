Naval gunboats rescued 58 Sri Lankans this weekend from a trawler 
sinking in the Indian Ocean on its way to smuggle them into Australia, 
officials said Monday. After a 30-day ordeal on the cramped vessel, 
the passengers were rescued Saturday just hours before the ship slipped 
under the water on Saturday 260 miles (420 kilometers) south of Sri 
Lanka, said Rear Admiral Haren Amaraweera, a naval spokesman. Passengers 
told Sri Lankan police that they paid a man in Marawila, 30 miles 
(50 kilometers) north of the capital, Colombo, to organize the 2,500-mile 
trip. Many sold or mortgaged their homes to raise the dlrs 7,500 fee. 
The average Sri Lankan earns dlrs 820 a year. They left during the 
night of Oct. 22 on board the trawler ``Fathima,'' said Amaraweera. 
After sailing 1,500 (2,400 kilometers) miles in 12 days, choppy seas 
forced them to turn back. ``There were no facilities for carrying 
passengers. They were just crammed into the hold in inhuman conditions,'' 
said Amaraweera. Worse was in store. Halfway back, the ship's freshwater 
tank was dislodged by waves and fell into the sea, causing a shortage 
of drinking water. On Friday, the engine caught fire and although 
the flames were doused, the boat began sinking. The trawler's radio 
distress signal was picked up by a nearby merchant ship and relayed 
to the southern Sri Lankan port of Galle. Gunboats rushed to the scene, 
together with trawlers in the area. Naval officials arrested the five-man 
Sri Lankan crew and handed them over to police. The passengers may 
be charged with illegally leaving the country, punishable by a dlrs 
75 fine or three months in jail. They were being questioned by police, 
who are hunting for the mastermind of the smuggling operation. This 
is the largest group of Sri Lankans caught trying to sneak into Australia, 
a popular destination for illegal migrants in search of work. Several 
smaller groups of Sri Lankans were arrested and sent home by Australian 
police in the last six months after landing in small boats. One group 
successfully made the crossing, only to wander for days in the outback 
after landing on a wild stretch of coast. Other groups were shipwrecked 
near Indonesia. Some have been caught trying to get to Japan and South 
Korea by ship, or hiding in trucks going to western Europe, mostly 
to Italy, Germany, France and Switzerland, from Russia and the Balkans. 
Many have died in these attempts, some being shipwrecked, others freezing 
or suffocating while crammed in trucks. Hundreds have simply disappeared, 
and their families believe they may have been killed by ships' crews 
and their bodies dumped in the sea.
