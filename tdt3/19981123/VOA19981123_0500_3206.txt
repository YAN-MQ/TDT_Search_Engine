So you think you're a pretty good songwriter? Well, David Bowie wants 
to hear from you. Okay, aspiring songwriters, David Bowie is looking 
for someone to help him finish up a song. That's the idea behind a 
new promotional contest that's being sponsored by Bowie himself and 
his new Internet venture which is at www.davidbowie.com. Again, www.davidbowie.com. 
Bowie's composed music for a new song called What's Really Happening, 
and he's asking his web-savvy fans for some help in finishing up the 
song. Aside from receiving a cowriting credit, the winner of this 
Bowie contest will also receive a $15,000 publishing contract as well 
as a free trip to New York so you can be in the studio when What's 
Really Happening is really recorded.
