Experts from the World Health Organization have warned of the threat 
of a global catastrophe from the spread of tuberculosis. On the first 
day of an international conference in the Thai capital, Bangkok, WHO 
officials said the epidemic was out of control in Asia and could spread 
all over the world. Dr. Donald Enerson from the International Union 
Against Tuberculosis says the disease can easily travel. TB doesn't 
stay within boundaries anymore. It goes all over the world. It travels 
on the airplane with you. It's in the line-up at the immigration with 
you. It's in the shop with you. It's in the bus with you. So the catastrophe 
is going to be a global catastrophe. Dr. Donald Enerson of the International 
Union Against Tuberculosis.
