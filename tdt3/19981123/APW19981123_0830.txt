Boris Yeltsin will run Russia from a hospital room for several days 
at least, aides said Monday, after the president fell ill with pneumonia 
_ the third time he's been sidelined by sickness in recent weeks. 
This latest ailment revived worries about Yeltsin's ability to run 
a country mired in economic troubles. But his condition wasn't critical 
enough to stop him from meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
in the Central Clinical Hospital on Monday. Film on Russian TV networks 
showed the two leaders sharing a joke in a reception room and Yeltsin, 
dressed in a sweater, did not look particularly ill. The 67-year-old 
president was rushed to the hospital Sunday with pneumonia and a temperature 
of 38.9 degrees C (102 F), the Kremlin said Monday. He was being treated 
with antibiotics. Yeltsin's condition ``hasn't worsened, but it hasn't 
improved either,'' and he still has a slight temperature, presidential 
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on Russia's NTV television Monday 
night. The president has rarely been seen in public recently, fueling 
speculation that he is seriously ill. He fell sick in October during 
a state visit to central Asia with what was described as a respiratory 
ailment. He was taken ill again in late October with what doctors 
described as high blood pressure and exhaustion. Since then the Kremlin 
appears to have been taking little chance with the president's health, 
ensuring that he has frequent medical checks and keeping his schedule 
to a minimum. Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out 
his term, which ends in the year 2000. Under the Russian Constitution, 
the prime minister takes over for three months if the president dies 
or is incapacitated. Yakushkin said Yeltsin would likely cancel meetings 
with foreign visitors this month, but will continue to meet Russian 
officials at the hospital. ``His doctors were not delighted that he 
decided to meet Jiang,'' Yakushkin said. He wouldn't say how long 
Yeltsin would stay in the hospital, but added that treatment for pneumonia 
usually takes 8-10 days. Also Monday, a top Kremlin aide was quoted 
by the Interfax news agency as saying that presidential power could 
be turned over to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``It may happen 
at any moment, that the premier may take over presidential duties 
for at least three months,'' said Natalia Savyolova, a spokeswoman 
to Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff. Savyolova 
said her remarks were unrelated to the president's latest illness. 
Primakov said Monday the government was working as normal and he was 
not assuming any extra powers. Yeltsin's health problems have forced 
him to cancel several foreign visits this fall. Dutch Queen Beatrix 
on Monday postponed a visit to Russia planned for this week because 
of Yeltsin's condition. Opposition leaders and a growing number of 
centrist politicians have questioned whether Yeltsin can fulfill his 
duties and there has been growing speculation about early elections. 
``We wish Mr. Yeltsin recovery,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov 
said in unusually mild remarks at a news conference Monday. ``But 
his illness is incurable _ he's an irresponsible person who is unable 
to govern the country, and everyone knows that.''
