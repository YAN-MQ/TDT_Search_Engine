Mary Chapin Carpenter is busy these days. She's helping Shane get 
back into the saddle again. The classic American western movie from 
the 1950s will soon be a Broadway musical. Mary Chapin Carpenter is 
going to be writing the music and the lyrics for the show which is 
expected to open in late 1999 or the spring of 2000. Now in case you've 
forgotten the story, Shane focuses on a world-weary gunfighter who 
tries to settle down and live a quiet life on the prairie; however, 
a long-simmering conflict between ranchers and farmers forces him 
to pick up the gun once more. She's got a new CD on the way next year 
too. It'll include a few new songs and some of her greatest hits, 
including Down at the Twist and Shout, The Hard Way, and Shut Up and 
Kiss Me, just to name three. I'm Katherine Cull.
