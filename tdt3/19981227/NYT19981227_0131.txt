What can we do to transform the messiness of 1998 into the improvement 
of our national life in the new year? How can we make lemonade out 
of this lemon of a presidency? Step One is well under way: After House 
impeachment and Senate action, no high official will be tempted to 
lie under oath or obstruct justice again soon. Step Two has yet to 
be addressed: At the root of Bill Clinton's undoubted criminality 
is a bad law. Needed is change in civil rights and sexual harassment 
litigation to enable the accused to assert a new ``citizen's privilege'' 
_ to refuse to involve third parties in an accuser's attempt to prove 
a pattern of harassment. If forced to confess as a condition of continuance, 
Clinton can claim to be a martyr to his civil disobedience. Step Three 
is to practice a long-overdue social jujitsu. We must use the force 
of the public's revulsion at the excesses being committed by the exposers 
of adultery to stop the erosion of personal privacy in public life. 
For daring to expose the real crimes committed to cover up moral transgressions, 
political figures are being ``outed'' for their adultery _ as if marital 
infidelity were equivalent to the crime of perjury. It is not. Sin 
is private and crime is public. To pretend otherwise for political 
or commercial gain is the height of hypocrisy. As an avowed libertarian 
conservative, I come to this assertion with nonpartisan hands. My 
privacy epiphany came after being wiretapped in the Nixon era. In 
this space, I deplored the use of divorce testimony to savage John 
Tower; defended Democratic Sen. Gary Hart and Mayor Marion Barry from 
lip-smacking sex entrappers; assailed the attempted radical-feminist 
lynching of Clarence Thomas; and denounced the Senate's unprecedented 
rummaging through Bob Packwood's personal diaries at the insistence 
of a sanctimonious Nevada ``ethicist.'' We privateers now face a danger 
from a combination of sin-seekers on the right and hypocrisy hypocrites 
on the left. Today, adulterers are the targets of choice. Tomorrow, 
the hypocri-moralizers will demand answers from female candidates 
about ever having had an abortion; from youthful candidates about 
masturbation; from the unmarried about ever having had homosexual 
thoughts; and from the purest of the pure about how they can condone 
their own children's premarital sex. Do we really want to pit truthful 
eunuchs against normal liars? One way to help slow this trend is for 
journalists who do their job of exposing financial and political corruption 
to look with disdain on those pornalists who march lockstep with the 
morality cops. And for family media to refuse to recycle uncritically 
the linen of sex-hungry media. We need the aid of public figures in 
this. In the 1980s, a reporter from a responsible newspaper asked 
Gary Hart the naked question ``Have you ever committed adultery?'' 
The candidate, with a stricken look on his face, said that he thought 
nobody should be required to answer such a question. In 1992, Clinton 
found a creative way to slip past the question. But Hart was right; 
the ``A'' question, unless dealing with a crime, ought never to be 
asked. But since it will be, what should the answer be? The response 
I suggested then has merit today: an aggressive, offended ``Go to 
hell!'' (Because the word ``hell,'' unless used to mean the domain 
of the devil, is stylistically frowned upon at The New York Times 
and other family-friendly publications, I will amend that to a vigorous 
``Leap in the lake!'' or a genteel ``Mind your own business.'') The 
rationale is this: When an absolutely faithful spouse boasts ``I have 
never strayed,'' he or she puts pressure on all other candidates to 
violate their families' privacy or to lie. Such bragging rewards sexual 
snoopiness, and encourages the pornalists' descent into questions 
shudderingly described above. When Dan Quayle volunteered assurance 
of his never-wavering fidelity on national television recently, he 
thereby unthinkingly undermined the civil liberty of fellow candidates. 
Dan _ a good man _ ought to be ashamed of himself, as should any other 
non-sinner who slyly encourages such intrusive questioning. Professions 
of purity pollute our politics. Don't brag; don't lie; just assert 
your ``citizen's privilege'' and don't make news with an answer.
