Helen Thomas has covered the White House for United Press International 
since the Kennedy administration, but in recent years, as the once-proud 
news agency withered, one could search through hundreds of American 
newspapers without finding her byline or her copy. What readers she 
has are mostly in Japan or scrolling through the World Wide Web. Friends 
and colleagues ask the 78-year-old Ms. Thomas what became of the organization 
that in its heyday was the first to tell the world about Kennedy's 
assassination. She answers, ruefully, ``I make it a point not to know.'' 
Then, with a mixture of defiance and verve, she adds, ``My joy is 
that we're still in business and we're alive.'' When she calls the 
office, she said, she is happy to know that ``someone answers on the 
other end.'' Not always the same someone, however. UPI, an organization 
whose chief executives seem to have a shelf life only slightly longer 
than a piece of wire copy, has named Arnaud de Borchgrave as president 
and chief executive. De Borchgrave, 72, who made his name synonymous 
with diplomatic reporting during 30 years at Newsweek and later edited 
The Washington Times, is rejoining a service that is a barely recognizable 
remnant of the Scripps Howard-owned, globe-spanning wire service he 
worked for in 1947, when he succeeded Walter Cronkite as UPI's Brussels 
bureau chief. Except in Washington, Chicago and a few other cities, 
UPI correspondents work in ``virtual bureaus'' (translation: home 
offices, or their kitchen tables), filing dispatches daily for clients 
that tend to be Web sites and local radio stations. Counting interim 
managers, de Borchgrave will be the sixth head of the beleaguered 
news agency since 1992, when it was purchased by the Middle East Broadcasting 
Center Ltd., whose principal owner, Sheik Walid al-Ibrahim, is a brother-in-law 
of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. De Borchgrave, who said he took the 
job after an interview with Sheik Walid in London, inherits an organization 
that has lost $120 million in five years, according to his predecessor, 
James Adams. The editor in chief, Susan Older, and Tobin Beck, a managing 
editor, say de Borchgrave inherits a staff of about 150 journalists 
_ a tenth the number in 1982 _ and another 200 stringers. That staff 
_ still bruised by Adams' speech at a public forum describing UPI 
as a ``sclerotic, corrupted organization'' populated by ``tired hacks'' 
_ along with an annual budget that a top editor put at $23 million, 
are the tools de Borchgrave has. His goal is to take the news service 
``upscale'' and to cover ``critically important news that others are 
ignoring.'' Speaking by telephone from his vacation home in Palm Beach, 
Fla., de Borchgrave mentioned other wire services with a hint of disdain. 
``I don't see why you would need another Reuters, AP or Bloomberg,'' 
he said. ``I'm going to try to go in another direction.'' The direction, 
he added, would be ``nonideological.'' In June 1991, he left his job 
as editor of The Washington Times, a newspaper controlled by the Korean 
evangelist Rev. Sun Myung Moon, which has since its inception offered 
acerbic coverage of Democratic politicians and generally respectful 
coverage of conservative Republicans and their ideas. ``I was raised 
on issues; I was not raised on scandal,'' de Borchgrave said. ``That's 
where I drifted apart from my younger reporters at The Washington 
Times. What was going on in somebody's basement was never of interest 
to me.'' What has been of interest to him, in the seven years he has 
spent at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington 
research center, has been electronic warfare. Among the events he 
regards as undercovered in the last two year _ the kind of events 
he would like to see at the top of UPI's agenda _ was President Clinton's 
comment in a May commencement address to the U.S. Naval Academy that 
attacks on government information systems from international adversaries 
were a growing threat. ``It would have been the lead to my story,'' 
de Borchgrave said. ``And I would have said, `Who the hell is attacking 
us?''' His challenge is partly financial; his predecessor had complained 
to colleagues that the payments from London were often late. Asked 
if a particular scheduled payment from UPI's investors had been late, 
Adams, who left in August after 14 months in the post, said, ``The 
use of the singular in that question is not appropriate.'' But he 
would not comment on the record about UPI management's financial dealings 
with its Saudi owners. De Borchgrave, however, said, ``The funds are 
in the bank for the next two years.'' He added, ``And I have a five-year 
contract.'' The new UPI chief is taking over an organization with 
top editors who say they were shell-shocked by the short, pyrotechnic 
tenure of Adams, a former editor at The Sunday Times of London, a 
tenure chronicled in detail in the Dec. 19 issue of Editor &AMP; Publisher 
magazine. Adams was remembered by top UPI editors interviewed last 
week as a believer in self-actualization sessions for management, 
power-point presentations for the rest of the staff and news releases 
like the one that began: ``James Adams. In the world of journalism, 
his name is synonymous with vision.'' Adams, in a telephone interview, 
said he had tried to create a sense of vision and camaraderie at UPI 
and new kinds of coverage, like in-depth reports on auto racing. But, 
he added, ``Reforming a company is not a casualty-free exercise.'' 
Ms. Older, UPI's editor in chief, said she was happy ``that we have 
someone of de Borchgrave's caliber coming in.'' UPI, she said, is 
``so far down'' that ``you don't have to knock down too many buildings 
to rebuild it.''
