Sri Lanka's best known woman athlete Susantika Jayasinghe says she 
wants to leave her homeland, live and train abroad because she can 
no longer bear harassment by local officials. ``I have reached the 
dead end, I cant bear it any more,'' Jayasinghe, 23, told The Associated 
Press Sunday. She said she was yet to decide where she would go. ``I 
have decided to go abroad. More than training, it is to get away from 
these officials who are harassing me, and get into a better frame 
of mind,'' she said. The world's 200 meters silver medalist, Jayasinghe 
is this Indian Ocean island country's most controversial athlete. 
She hit the headline again earlier this month after she pulled out 
of the Asian Games in Bangkok, pleading injury. She has twice tested 
positive for performance enhancing drugs. But, she says, that is because 
she has often taken medication to control her menstrual cycle which 
can leave traces of organic compounds found in Nandralone-19, a performance 
enhancing drug. A ban on her was lifted after medical evidence proved 
her correct. After she returned from Bangkok, midway during the Dec. 
6-20 Asian Games, the Island newspaper in Colombo quoted her as saying 
that she was being harassed by local sports officials and could not 
concentrate on her training. Jayasinghe has not named any officials, 
but in the past she had accused sports ministry officials of harassment, 
including sexual advances which she says she resisted. She has also 
said that powerful politicians were plotting to kill her husband. 
``I have been subjected to many urine tests in my rather short athletic 
career, but this latest test has much more than the eye would fathom 
or see,'' she said in an earlier interview after an out-of-turn test 
following her Athens triumph. Her accusations, the first to get wide 
publicity in conservative Sri Lanka, have even reached parliament, 
with deputies and ministers making wild statements, charges and counter-charges. 
The village girl who practiced running barefoot among rubber trees 
in central Sri Lanka won a silver medal in the women's 200 meter sprint 
at the World Track Championship in Athens in August last year. Jayasinghe 
became only the second Sri Lankan athlete to win a medal at a top 
international meet in 49 years. Duncan White won a silver in the 400 
meter hurdles at the 1948 Olympics. ``I am from a poor family, my 
father is a laborer in a rubber estate. My request is please let me 
run and please don't bother me.''
