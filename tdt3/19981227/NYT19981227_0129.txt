Elma Lewis, 77, tried not working, on orders from her doctors. ``I 
went down to 98 pounds and almost died when they made me not work,'' 
she said. Ms. Lewis, who suffers from kidney failure and undergoes 
dialysis three times a week, now follows her own prescription: ``Work, 
work, work until you die.'' The day after Christmas found her backstage 
at the Tremont Temple theater downtown _ she had come straight from 
dialysis _ meeting with the large cast of ``Black Nativity,'' the 
exuberant Langston Hughes gospel play she has been producing and directing 
during the holiday season here for 29 years. Diabetes has left her 
nearly blind, but Ms. Lewis makes it clear that she is not about to 
let that fact get in the way of her directing. ``I saw perfectly well 
for over 60 years, and I can still see some things,'' she said during 
an interview earlier in the week. ``We're always looking at what's 
lost,'' she added. ``I have to look at what I have and where I can 
go.'' What this daughter of West Indian immigrants has are 28 honorary 
doctorate degrees, the Presidential Medal for the Arts, a MacArthur 
Fellowship, commonly called the genius grant, and, most important 
to her, the several generations of children who have come under her 
influence through ``Black Nativity,'' and at the Elma Lewis School 
of Fine Arts which she opened in 1950 and which she hopes will soon 
reopen. In them she has instilled her creed: ``Glory in yourself. 
Anything is possible.'' That is how her parents, Clairmont and Edwardine 
Lewis, a day laborer and a maid, who revered education, the arts and 
Marcus Garvey, raised her and her two older brothers. ``Up you mighty 
people, you can what you will,'' Ms. Lewis said, quoting Marcus Garvey, 
whose teachings still guide her. She was talking in the living room 
of the two-story house, in the Roxbury neighborhood, that once belonged 
to her parents. She was seated across from the grand piano, covered 
with Christmas cards, that her mother had bought for her brother Darnley 
when he was a boy with precocious musical talent. ``It never occurred 
to my mother that she would go and buy a secondhand, run-down piano,'' 
Ms. Lewis said. ``She went and bought this piano for $1,200 _ a dollar 
a week.'' Practicing on that piano, Ms. Lewis' late brother went on 
to the New England Conservatory of Music. Ms. Lewis also showed early 
talent in the arts, and at age 3 her mother had her evaluated by a 
team of white educators. Ms. Lewis can still quote from the report: 
``This bright, precocious little Negro girl will, as is usual with 
members of her race, test at a much lower level as she gets older.'' 
``They had already written me off,'' she said. But her parents would 
not allow their daughter to be written off, and she went on to the 
prestigious Boston Latin School. She worked her way through Emerson 
College, and Boston University, where she earned a master's degree 
in education, by dancing and reciting poetry in churches. She opened 
her school in Roxbury with $300, two used pianos, two used folding 
tables and two used chairs. It never occurred to her that the school 
might not succeed. ``If I wanted to do something, I did it,'' she 
said. The world came to Boston to help Ms. Lewis. Harry Belafonte, 
Duke Ellington, Odetta, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Max Roach: They all 
pitched in to teach or perform or help raise money. Over the years, 
thousands of children studied classical ballet _ taught by Ms. Lewis 
herself _ theater and voice at the Elma Lewis School. One of those 
children was Annette Brown, who went on to become a choreographer, 
and the ballet mistress for ``Black Nativity.'' ``My whole life was 
dancing with Miss Lewis,'' said Ms. Brown, 51. ``She always told us 
we were working to be the best.'' Ms. Brown was talking before the 
evening performance of ``Black Nativity'' last Saturday, the second-to-last 
day of this year's run. The show, with its cast of 150 professionals 
and amateurs, nearly half of them children, is produced by the nonprofit 
National Center of Afro-American Artists, which Ms. Lewis founded. 
The story of the birth of Christ set to the beat of African drums, 
``Black Nativity'' is as much a part of the holiday scene in Boston 
as the Nutcracker Ballet that is performed at the Wang and Emerson 
Theatres down the street. Families have grown up with ``Black Nativity,'' 
the children starting out in the role of the baby Jesus, moving on 
to the chorus and eventually, if they are talented and disciplined, 
becoming soloists. Sele'Fana Kamau, 20, joined the chorus when she 
was 6, and never left. ``I used to be afraid to sing,'' said Ms. Kamau, 
who credits her four-year scholarship to the Berklee School of Music 
to her training with Ms. Lewis. ``My heart would go boom, boom, boom.'' 
It was nearly showtime. John Andrew Ross, the musical director, took 
his place at the piano, as he has for 29 years. Ms. Lewis, wearing 
a long red dress and bent over her walker, took a seat in one of the 
first rows of the audience. It was her second performance of the day. 
The audience clapped and sang and shouted along with ``Black Nativity,'' 
and when it was over they gave it a standing ovation as they do almost 
every night. Ms. Lewis still had the post-performance critique to 
do with the cast. Despite her near blindness, she seems to see every 
step and misstep on stage. ``The children ask me, `How do you know 
I'm wrong?','' she said. ``I tell them, `Never mind how I know. I 
know. That's my gift.' ''
