The military put 10 new Topol-M nuclear missiles on full combat readiness 
Sunday, the first time the missile has been deployed. The missile 
was developed to sustain Russia as a global nuclear power. The single-warhead 
Topol-M's were commissioned in the Saratov region, about 700 kilometers 
(450 miles) southeast of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
The deployment was a major step for Russia's cash-strapped military. 
The government doesn't have enough money to maintain all its armed 
forces, and decided to concentrate defense spending on developing 
the Topol-M. ``This is a very important event, because even in the 
difficult financial conditions of 1998 we have managed to find funds 
for financing this top priority area,'' said Defense Minister Igor 
Sergeyev, according to ITAR-Tass. A parliament committee is drafting 
a bill that would guarantee funding to the strategic missile forces 
until 2010, regardless of the country's economic situation, the Interfax 
news agency reported. The measure would ensure that Russia maintains 
nuclear parity with the West, according to Roman Popkovich, chairman 
of the Defense Committee of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. 
The intercontinental Topol-M will be the new heart of Russia's missile 
forces. Forty are expected to be built by the end of 2000, taking 
the place of heavier, multiple-warhead missiles. The Topol-M is a 
lightweight, rugged missile designed to be fired from a vehicle. Its 
range has been reported to exceed 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles), 
and its mobility increases its safety from preemptive enemy first 
strikes, unlike silo-based warheads.
