More menacing words tonight from Iraq to the United Nations -- a threat 
to evict U.N. aid workers, once the oil-for-food agreement ends in 
April. In the week since America and Britain stopped bombing, Iraq 
has been raising the stakes to try to end the U.N. sanctions. NBC's 
Stan Bernard is monitoring developments from London tonight. Anti-American 
and anti-British demonstrations in basra, Baghdad and other Iraqi 
cities today. The usually orchestrated demonstrations coincided with 
statements from the government calling for an end to economic sanctions 
and said it will defend itself from military overflights. Iraq's vice 
president, taha Yassin Ramadan, said his country would confront allied 
planes, enforcing the "no fly zones" over southern and northern iraq. 
And by that, Iraq usually means anti-aircraft fire, not sending aircraft 
up to meet them. Iraq claims it fired at an allied overflight yesterday. 
The rules of engagement are the same. Any Iraqi radar that locks on 
to aircraft becomes a target. A British defense analyst says Iraqi's 
air warning system was not knocked out in the recent air war. But 
the threat is more political than military. It is almost traditional 
after a big strike. They do a show of defiance. Can they actively 
defy it? Ultimately, no. They will lose. Can they cause a lot of problems 
militarily, in the short term, to allied flights over this area? yes. 
Can they cause diplomatic problems in the wider sense, much bigger 
problems? Absolutely. The Iraqi diplomatic effort moved to Amman today 
where Arab parliamentarians discussed the recent air war and the real 
Iraqi issue, the end of sanctions. And demonstrators were outside, 
urging Arab nations to call for an end to those sanctions. They have 
to represent their attitude, our attitude, to lift the embargo. Jordan's 
crown prince Hassan said the sanctions were no way to deal with Iraq. 
But Iraq's delegation wanted a more unified condemnation of the U.S. 
some arab leaders, particularly in the gulf, are still very wary of 
Saddam. Arab unity is visible only on the streets, which could threaten 
to push the arab leadership into an anti-American policy. Stan Bernard, 
NBC news, London.
