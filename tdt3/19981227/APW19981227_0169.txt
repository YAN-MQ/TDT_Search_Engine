In its latest challenge to the United States and Britain, Iraq declared 
that it will fire on warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones that Washington 
and its allies imposed after the Gulf War. The United States and Britain 
said their aircraft would continue to enforce the no-fly zones and 
pilots would respond to any threats. ``Iraq knows that it should not 
interfere with those flights, and our pilots can act in self-defense 
if they feel threatened at any time,'' National Security Council spokesman 
P. J. Crowley said in Washington. A Ministry of Defense spokesman 
in London said all British and American aircraft ``operate to a very 
strict set of rules of engagement. If aircraft are threatened those 
rules of engagement do allow the return of fire.'' The United States, 
Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in 1991-92 to halt air 
attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north and Shiite Muslim rebels 
in the south. French aircraft no longer patrol the northern zone, 
but still help to maintain the southern zone. A week after a U.S.-British 
bombing campaign against Iraq ended, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin 
Ramadan said his government would not allow flights over northern 
and southern Iraq. ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi 
airspace will be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan told Qatar's Al-Jazeera 
television Saturday. Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally 
confronted aircraft flying in the area. Asked why Iraq had not fired 
previously on planes enforcing the no-fly zones, Ramadan said, ``When 
you want to restore your rights, you choose the suitable time and 
circumstances.'' Ramadan repeated Iraq's hardened stance in an interview 
with Associated Press Television News on Sunday, saying: ``The so-called 
farce of no-fly zones must end. ... The so-called no-fly zones only 
exist in the British and American imagination.'' Ramadan also said 
it was not imperative that Iraq be invited to a summit some Arab nations 
are seeking to convene. But he said that if the summit does not denounce 
the U.S. and British airstrikes and call for lifting sanctions, it 
will be viewed by Baghdad as ``a new conspiracy.'' State-controlled,
