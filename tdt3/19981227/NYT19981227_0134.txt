Michelle Thomas, an actress in the television programs ``The Cosby 
Show,'' ``Family Matters'' and ``The Young and the Restless'' died 
on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. 
She was 30 and lived in Los Angeles, though she had been staying with 
her family in Weehawken, N.J., since November. The cause was cancer, 
said Kahdijah Bell, her publicist and cousin. Miss Thomas had been 
playing Callie, an aspiring vocalist, in the CBS soap opera ``The 
Young and the Restless'' since August and began a medical leave late 
in October. She was nominated recently for an Image Award from the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as outstanding 
actress in a daytime drama series, for her acting in that program. 
Earlier she played Justine, Theo's sweet, sensitive girlfriend, on 
the NBC sitcom ``The Cosby Show.'' She also played Myra, Steve Urkel's 
lovesick girlfriend, on ``Family Matters,'' also a sitcom, for five 
seasons, on ABC and then on CBS. Miss Thomas also appeared on other 
television shows, onstage, in commercials, on videos and in movies, 
including ``Hangin' With the Homeboys'' (1991). She was born in Boston, 
grew up in Montclair, N.J., and graduated from West Essex High School 
in North Caldwell, N.J. She received her basic training in acting 
from her mother, Phynjuar Thomas, a stage actress who remained her 
personal coach for the rest of her career. Miss Thomas also studied 
acting with Flo Greenberg and with Tony Abeson. Besides her mother 
and her father, Dennis Thomas, a saxophonist who is the musical director 
of the band Kool and the Gang, she is survived by her grandfather, 
Cecil Saunders, and a brother, David, all of Weehawken.
