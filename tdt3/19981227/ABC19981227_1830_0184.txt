What does it take to keep severely premature infants alive? ABC's 
Jamie Floyd spent this day at a hospital unit that specializes in 
treating the tiniest human beings. For the parents of premature babies, 
a normally happy event can be an ordeal. Parents must spend the first 
few weeks of their babies' lives with doctors, nurses. Each baby has 
team in a 24-hour period probably of eight to ten people who are taking 
care of it. And lots of equipment. It takes medical time and it takes 
a huge amount of equipment on this baby. And probably per pound, this 
is the most expensive patient in the hospital to take care of. Dr. 
Warren rosenfeld is a neonatalogist. He says the smaller the baby, 
the harder it is to keep alive. We're not measuring things in pounds 
anymore, but in ounces, and each drop in an once makes the baby usually 
more immature and the systems within the baby's body are really not 
developed. Together, counting odera, the Houston octuplets weighed 
a little more than ten pounds. According to the hospital where odera 
was born, she was the size of a Beanie baby. Doctors call such babies 
micropreemies. You can see that this baby would easily fit in the 
palm of my hand. And this baby is over two pounds. This is 3 or 3 
1/2 times the size of a baby who weighs ten ounces. These babies face 
an uphill battle. We always worry first about the lungs, the second 
is the brain. Then we worry about the heart. Doctors have to re-create 
the environment of the womb outside the womb. The uterus is made to 
hold a term baby of about six to eight pounds. And when you start 
crowding more babies into the uterus, the amount of weight or the 
size to which the uterus can grow and the babies can grow are limited. 
So the surviving chukwu babies face greater challenges than other 
premature babies. We don't have all the answers. And we're going to 
need many years more before we have the answer for ten-ounce babies.
