Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni flew to Libya, apparently violating 
U.N. sanctions, for talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, the 
official JANA news agency said Sunday. Egypt's Middle East News Agency 
said the two met Sunday morning. The JANA report, monitored by the 
BBC, said the two leaders would discuss the peace process in the Great 
Lakes region of Africa. Museveni told reporters on arrival in the 
Libyan capital Tripoli on Saturday that he and Gadhafi also would 
discuss ``new issues in order to contribute to the solution of the 
continent's problems,'' the BBC quoted JANA as saying. African leaders 
have been flying into Libya since the Organization of African Unity 
announced in June that it would no longer abide by the air embargo 
against Libya when the trips involved official business or humanitarian 
projects. The U.N. Security Council imposed an air travel ban and 
other sanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans 
wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, 
that killed 270 people.
