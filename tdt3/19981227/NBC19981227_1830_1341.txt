And from Beijing itself tonight, the story of one woman's protest 
against progress. Here's NBC's Chris billing. On one side, workers 
with shovels. On the other, heavy equipment. And in the middle -- 
zhang wanzhen's house standing right where a new shopping center is 
supposed to go. She is refusing to move. It's my property. I've lived 
here my whole life. My family has been here for many generations. 
a court has been asked to decide whether the house stays or goes. 
Narrow alleyways like this one, called hutongs, once made up the social 
fabric of Beijing. And the courtyard house was the center of life. 
Surrounded by high walls, these traditional homes provide a quiet 
sanctuary from the bustle outside. But now, Beijing's old neighborhoods 
are being razed in the city's rush to modernize building malls, office 
towers, and apartment buildings. Long time residents, like 83-year-old 
Zhao jingxin, complain that the city's charm is being destroyed. Beijing 
should be developed, that's true. But not to demolish all of the hutongs 
and courtyard houses, which is the uniqueness of this old and ancient 
city. a few Chinese legislators have now spoken up, recently submitting 
a motion calling for the protection of historic sites. But it may 
be a case of too little, too late. Only a few pockets of old Beijing 
remain and the demolition crews are closing in. Chris billing, NBC 
news, Beijing.
