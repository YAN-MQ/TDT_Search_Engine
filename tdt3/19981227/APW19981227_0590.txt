An elephant who had rampaged through human settlements and trampled 
to death 19 people in the last year-and-a-half, was shot dead in northeastern 
India by orders of the forest department, domestic news agencies reported 
Sunday. The elephant, named Gobindra Singh, was declared a ``rogue'' 
last month when he killed a forest department doctor who had tranquilized 
him for a medical check. The elephant suddenly regained consciousness 
and attacked the veterinarian. Since elephant hunting is banned, it 
is difficult to declare and elephant a rogue.
