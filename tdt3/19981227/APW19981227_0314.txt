Saudi Arabia on Sunday denied reports that a senior government official 
had plotted to assassinate Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden. ``These 
accusations are false and have no basis in reality,'' the Saudi Press 
Agency quoted an official as saying. The official's name was not given. 
Bin Laden accused the governor of the Saudi capital of Riyadh, Prince 
Salman Bin Abdul Aziz, of plotting his assassination, the independent 
Pakistani newspaper The News reported Saturday. Bin Laden said the 
governor offered about dlrs 267,000 for his death, according to the 
English-language newspaper. ``Thanks to Allah, the assassination attempt 
by one Siddiq Ahmad and his two accomplices failed,'' the report quoted 
bin Laden as saying. The newspaper said that bin Laden's would-be 
assassin confessed. The official Saudi agency on Sunday said Prince 
Salman did not know anyone named Siddiq Ahmad. Bin Laden was stripped 
of his Saudi citizenship in 1994. He had been at odds with the ruling 
family since 1991 when foreign troops were allowed into Saudi Arabia, 
home to two of Islam's holiest sites, Mecca and Medina. Saudi Arabia 
downgraded ties with Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia in September 
because they are harboring Bin Laden, a Taliban diplomat said. Saudi 
Arabia was one of only three countries, including Pakistan and the 
United Arab Emirates, that had recognized the Taliban as the legitimate 
government of the war-torn country. Bin Laden is wanted by American 
authorities for allegedly directing attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August. The blasts killed 259 people, including 12 
Americans, and wounded thousands.
