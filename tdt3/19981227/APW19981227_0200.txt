When legislators began rewriting Poland's penal code to replace a 
1969 communist-era law, Poles thought the result would be less crime 
and speedier justice. But the new system that took effect in September 
has raised complaints among judges, police, the news media and the 
public that it favors criminals by reducing prison terms and eliminating 
capital punishment. ``The defenders of the new code assure they want 
to fight the rising crime, but they promote provisions that allow 
criminals to leave prison early,'' said Robert Sichulski, a construction 
engineer. Opinion polls find increasing support for bringing back 
the death penalty, which was suspended in 1989 and left out of the 
new code. ``Can our strapped state afford to board convicts for a 
lifetime?'' asked Alicja Frackiewicz, a housewife. The unhappiness 
reflects the general difficulties of the economic and social changes 
in the nine years since communist rule was toppled and Poland shifted 
to a multiparty democracy and market economy. Gone are the staples 
of the communist system, including guaranteed employment, free education 
and health care, along with the pervasive police and military presence 
that limited personal freedom while preventing much street crime. 
With high unemployment, rising costs and fewer police patrols, crime 
has increased in recent years in most categories. Police say 1,038 
murders were recorded in the first 11 months of 1998, compared to 
971 in all of 1991. The old penal code enacted by communist rulers 
targeted political dissenters and secured a surface stability by banning 
demonstrations and rallies, except for official May Day parades. New 
freedom and opportunity have produced new kinds of crime _ gangs that 
require new members to murder for their initiation; widespread auto 
theft; robberies; burglaries. The new law, drawn up by criminal justice 
professors and legal experts, was intended to reduce police bureaucracy 
and simplify judicial procedures in a country where an average case 
takes 2 1/2 years to complete. One change avoids a trial if the defendant 
confesses and agrees to a penalty chosen by the judge. Crimes have 
been subdivided into categories, according to the circumstances of 
the case, with precise penalties for conviction. ``The sanctions are 
more flexible. There is a choice between a fine or prison in many 
cases,'' said Barbara Makosa-Stepkowska, spokeswoman for the Justice 
Ministry. ``The judges are given wide possibilities and a greater 
credit of trust.'' But Judge Barbara Piwnik, a 16-year veteran, called 
the system too rigid and said it ``strikes with a lack of trust in 
the judges,'' who know what works and what doesn't. ``If I am told 
that homicide is from eight years to life imprisonment, but when a 
dangerous tool was used it is from 12 years up, is that a sign of 
trust in my knowledge and life experience?'' she asked. Piwnik complains 
that maximum sentences for some serious crimes were reduced, such 
as the new 12-year limit for a gang rape, compared to 15 years previously. 
She also dislikes the new obligation to reduce the sentence of convicts 
who aid investigators. In a recent case, Judge Malgorzata Mojkowska 
expressed frustration in giving a 15-year sentence to one member of 
a group of young people who killed a teen-ager, while the others got 
life terms. The one with the shorter sentence helped police. She was 
required to be lenient, but realized that ``cooperation with the police 
will not atone for the injuries,'' the judge said in handing down 
the sentence. Makosa-Stepkowska, the Justice Ministry spokeswoman, 
said lesser penalties like that will result in more criminals being 
brought to justice by turning criminals against each other. Tadeusz 
de Virion, a lawyer who defended opposition figures during the communist 
era, considers the new penal code a ``return to normalcy.'' ``The 
judge's heart, intellect and knowledge are the foundations of a good 
justice system,'' he said. ``A wise, compassionate judge will hand 
just verdicts even if the code is not of prime quality.'' De Virion 
said police presence, not a penal code, is the best weapon against 
street crime. But police spokesman Pawel Biedziak argued the opposite. 
``Why are perpetrators hiding from us?'' he asked. ``Because they 
fear long prison terms.''
