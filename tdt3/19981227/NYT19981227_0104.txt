There are games when Scott Lachance is outstanding, when he flashes 
the skills and instincts that for years have made him one of the Islanders' 
most reliable defenseman. Then there are games when he passes the 
puck to an opposing player in a crucial situation or unintentionally 
knocks the puck into the Islanders' goal, which he has done four times 
this season. Recently, Lachance's play declined so much that Mike 
Milbury, the Islanders coach and general manager, scratched him three 
times and said publicly that Lachance has lost his spot on the team. 
Milbury first took a healthy Lachance, who is minus-10 in the plus-minus 
rating this season, out of the lineup on Dec. 15 against San Jose. 
The coach benched him again for the Islanders' next game, on Dec. 
17 against Los Angeles, and Lachance has not played regularly since. 
After the back-to-back scratches, Lachance returned for the Islanders' 
next two games, but did not play well enough to gain back Milbury's 
confidence. After Lachance missed last Tuesday's game against St. 
Louis with the flu, he was scratched on Saturday, even with an injury 
to Bryan Berard, for the Islanders 4-2 victory over Boston at Nassau 
Coliseum. Milbury thinks that Lachance, a first-round draft pick and 
the fourth pick over all in 1991, can still be a good player. He thinks 
the problem is Lachance's mental approach to the game. ``I've said 
this about Scott Lachance since the day I got here,'' Milbury said. 
``He'll play in this league as long as he wants. He's got talent, 
he can skate and he's big in big games.'' ``What I haven't seen and 
what I continue not to see is consistency in effort and intensity,'' 
Milbury said. ``We have other guys who are trying very hard, who really 
care and really try. I'm not saying that his performances are inconsistent. 
It's possible that he's lost a spot here and he'll have to wait for 
an opportunity. He's going to have to win a spot.'' Lachance was visibly 
shaken by Milbury's post-game comments when reporters relayed them 
to him in the locker room after Saturday's game. ``I'm just going 
to do what I can,'' Lachance said quietly. ``I'm not going to comment 
on what Mike said. I'd like to discuss it in private with Mike.'' 
``It's the coach's decision,'' Lachance said. ``All I can do is work 
hard as I can to get back into the lineup.'' It may not be easy for 
Lachance, since the Islanders have been stockpiling defenseman. They 
picked up Eric Cairns, the former Ranger, off of waivers last week, 
and now have eight defenseman on the roster. When Berard returns from 
a strained groin in a couple of weeks, and Cairns returns soon from 
a sore ankle, something is going to have to give. The newcomers Eric 
Brewer, Barry Richter and Zdeno Chara have given surprisingly solid 
performances, so Milbury has not felt any pressure to play Lachance. 
Despite clues suggesting otherwise, Milbury said he won't trade Lachance. 
``But I'm in no rush to give away Scott Lachance,'' Milbury said. 
``The day I trade him is the day I've failed as a coach.''
