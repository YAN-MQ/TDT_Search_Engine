Four members of a family were killed in what police believe was a 
family revenge attack in a region in eastern South Africa that has 
been plagued by violence, police said Sunday. The attack took place 
Saturday evening in a rural area in KwaZulu-Natal, where two gunmen 
armed with heavy caliber rifles allegedly forced open the door and 
began shooting, said Capt. Joshua Gwala, a police spokesman. The victims 
ranged in age from 8 to 30 years. The killing brought to 21 the total 
number of people killed since Christmas Eve in four different attacks. 
Police discounted any links among the killings that occurred in towns 
spread throughout the region. In the worst attack on Christmas Eve, 
eight people died in the town of Margate. Saturday's attack in the 
small village of Ntabamhlophe developed from a dispute between two 
families, police said. President Nelson Mandela on Saturday said he 
backed a special initiative from the National Director of Public Prosecutions 
to investigate the killings. Multiple killings in KwaZulu-Natal receive 
special attention after more than 10,000 people died in political 
clashes in the years before the first all-race elections in 1994. 
On Christmas Day in 1995, a political massacre claimed 18 lives in 
Shobashobane, when 2,000 armed supporters of the Zulu nationalist 
Inkatha Freedom Party attacked rival members of Mandela's African 
National Congress.
