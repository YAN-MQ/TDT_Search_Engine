43 years ago this week, African-Americans won the right to play golf 
on public courses. Jim Huber looks at one of the milestones in the 
civil rights movement. He walks this public golf course in Atlanta 
weekly. Nobody throws rocks or yells threats or stands in his path. 
The color of his money is the only standard now. But five decades 
ago, this world was a far, far different place, and there were battles 
on every plain -- for the right to an education, to any seat on a 
bus, to play on any public golf course. James Meredith of Ole Mississippi. 
Rosa parks, we Revere. But does the name tup Holmes ring a bell? It 
was a warm Christmas eve, 1955, three black men, two brothers and 
a friend, head for north Fulton golf club in Atlanta. We got to the 
golf course -- got out of our car and directly in front of us was 
a white golfer getting out of his car with his, with his pull cart. 
And when he looked around and saw us, he grabbed his pull cart slammed 
his door down on his car and ran like hell up to the golf shop and 
you know what he said, he said "they're coming!" It took them four 
excruciating, expensive, dangerous years, but yes, they were finally 
coming to play. The late Alfred "tup" Holmes, his brother Oliver, 
and their friend Charles bell had made their first attempt at another 
Atlanta course in 1951. The day that we went out to play, to Register, 
and were denied, we asked why were we being denied. He said well no 
black person, people of color, was allowed to play on the city courses. 
Four years of litigation that eventually wound up in the Supreme Court 
made national headlines and divided a city. All the while, Holmes 
and his friends, who were very good golfers, played where they could. 
The round that Christmas eve 43 years ago was as uneventful as one 
can be, considering that the cameras eventually found them. Tup, who 
went on to play with Charlie sifford and Teddy Rhodes, among others 
on the black professional tour, shot a 72 that day, an historical 
afternoon lost in civil rights Lore. The history books might ignore 
them, but the golf community does not. One of those nine public courses 
that refused them for so many years is now named the Alfred "tup" 
Holmes golf club. In Atlanta, I'm Jim Huber.
