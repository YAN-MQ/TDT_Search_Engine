Iraq has declared that it will refuse to extend a U.N.-monitored program 
that brings crucial food to families struggling under U.N. sanctions 
_ striking another blow in its latest confrontation with the United 
Nations. Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Sunday that 
Baghdad will ask some 400 U.N. workers who monitor the U.N.-approved 
oil-for-food program to leave, but he did not give a date. The latest 
phase of the program _ which allows Iraq to sell oil in return for 
needed supplies _ doesn't expire until the end of April. Saleh's announcement 
was the latest Iraqi response to the four-day U.S. and British bombing 
campaign that ended Dec. 20. Washington and London launched the airstrikes 
after U.N. weapons inspectors reported that Baghdad had not kept its 
promise of full cooperation in the search for its weapons of mass 
destruction. U.N. officials declined to comment Sunday on Iraq's declaration. 
Baghdad's first response was to ban the inspectors from returning 
to Iraq. On Saturday, Iraq said it would fire on U.S. and British 
warplanes patrolling skies over northern and southern Iraq. The Iraqi 
government has also criticized its traditional allies on the U.N. 
Security Council _ Russia, China and France _ for not doing enough 
to prevent the airstrikes. At a meeting of Arab legislators from 16 
nations in Amman, Jordan, Iraq's parliament speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, 
called for a resolution demanding that economic sanctions against 
Baghdad be lifted. The lawmakers strongly condemned last week's U.S.-British 
attacks as ``unjust aggression'' on Iraq. They also called on their 
governments to work on the lifting of the U.N. trade embargo, which 
has crippled the country's economy. In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak said he opposed the airstrikes but blamed Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein for provoking the attacks, a newspaper reported. ``The ruling 
regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems ... and Egypt 
naturally does not support this regime,'' Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted 
Mubarak as saying in its early Monday edition. The U.N. embargo, imposed 
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be lifted until the weapons 
inspectors verify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction. 
The oil-for-food program began in 1996 to bring crucial supplies such 
as flour, lentils, rice, sugar and medicine to families struggling 
under sanctions. It is generally extended every six months. Though 
Iraq desperately needs the goods, it long has feared the program makes 
it easier for the world to allow the sanctions to continue. ``Iraq 
refuses the continuation of this project and demands the lifting of 
sanctions,'' Saleh said. ``This means the ouster of U.N. teams which 
supervise it.'' About 400 U.N. workers monitor the program to ensure 
that the Iraqi government does not divert any of the money for aid 
and use it for its own purposes. The latest six month phase allows 
Iraq to sell dlrs 5.2 billion in oil to buy needed supplies.
