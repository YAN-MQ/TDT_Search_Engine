Iraq on Sunday submitted a draft resolution to a meeting of Arab legislators 
urging Arab nations to ignore U.N. sanctions on Iraq and demanding 
that all foreign troops be pulled out of the Gulf. The resolution 
was put before the Arab Parliamentary Union by a delegation headed 
by Iraq's parliament speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, as about 200 members 
of Jordanian political parties and unions held a sit-in to demand 
an end to the sanctions. Outside Amman's Royal Theater where the lawmakers 
are meeting, the demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and waved 
banner saying any aggression on Iraq amounts to an attack on the entire 
Arab world. Four days of U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq that ended 
Dec. 19 brought demonstrations throughout the Arab world in support 
of Iraq, but until now all Arab governments have adhered to the trade 
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. When 
Hammadi arrived Saturday in Amman, he said Sunday's emergency meeting 
of Arab lawmakers should be a ``reflection of Arab masses' condemnation 
of the U.S.-British aggression on Iraq and a demand for governments 
to break the embargo.'' Eighteen out of the Parliamentary Union's 
19 member states are due to send delegations to the meeting. Kuwait 
_ which has resisted all efforts to ease sanctions on Iraq _ has said 
it will not take part. The Iraqi resolution urges Arabs to condemn 
the American and British governments for their disrespect to Muslims 
since the air attacks spilled over into the first day of Ramadan, 
the Muslim month of fasting and prayer. It called the attack ``a racial 
aggression ... against Islam.'' The resolution urges that ``Arab governments 
lift the embargo on Iraq and impose sanctions on the U.S.-U.K. interests 
in the Arab World.'' The United States and Britain have been the strongest 
advocates of maintaining the sanctions, which limit Iraq's oil exports 
and cannot be lifted until U.N. experts certify the county has eliminated 
its weapons of mass destruction. U.S. and British officials said the 
attacks were aimed at degrading the ability of President Saddam Hussein's 
government to make prohibited weapons and at demanding the Iraq reverse 
its pledge not to cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors. The Iraqi resolution 
submitted Sunday also calls on Arab parliaments to demand foreign 
troops be pulled out of the Arab Gulf states and that those states 
stop providing facilities and services to foreign armies. The United 
States has some 17,000 troops in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain 
and on ships offshore. Britain also has troops and warplanes in Kuwait 
and several ships in the Gulf. In the past, Iraqi Cabinet ministers 
have toured Middle Eastern capitals to encourage Arab governments 
to defy the sanctions. But none of the governments has done more than 
turn a blind eye to smuggling into Iraq.
