They had heard the news from Cincinnati, depression wrapped in a ballooning 
score as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers brought an early end to any enchanted 
dreams the New York Giants harbored for this day. Heartsick and dejected, 
the Giants shuffled through a sleepy first half against the Philadelphia 
Eagles and glumly returned to their locker room beneath the Veterans 
Stadium grandstand. Defensive Coordinator John Fox assembled the defensive 
players. ``We're all disappointed,'' Fox said. ``Let's at least finish 
what we started. Finish it the right way.'' It's unclear whether Fox 
was talking about Sunday's game or the Giants' 1998 season. But the 
Giants shut out the Eagles in the second half to rally and win the 
season finale, 20-10, and by doing so closed with a four-game winning 
streak and an 8-8 record. The Giants, dazed and reeling six weeks 
ago, sprinted to what they consider a telling conclusion. It left 
them one victory short of a playoff berth, but it allowed the Giants 
to mix hope with the disappointment. ``I think we will start next 
year fresh,'' Giants defensive end Michael Strahan said. ``Because 
I think we will learn from this year's mistakes.'' Most of the Giants 
were philosophical about this last day of the season and how it unfolded 
predictably, if unfavorably, for them. Tampa Bay's 35-0 victory over 
the Cincinnati Bengals had eliminated the Giants from playoff contention. 
Arizona's 16-13 overtime victory over San Diego later in the day sent 
the Cardinals into the post-season. The Giants heard the Tampa Bay 
score in their locker room an hour before the start of their game. 
``It was too bad, but you had to be realistic,'' linebacker Corey 
Widmer said. ``They didn't lose it for us, we lost it for us earlier 
in the year.'' Players and coaches took a similar approach when discussing 
their uneven season, which saw the defending National Football Conference 
East champions lose seven of their first 10 games. ``I'm very disappointed 
that we left this a bit short and I'll take the blame for that,'' 
Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ``We put ourselves behind the eight 
ball early, and I've got to figure out what changes to make so that 
doesn't happen again. ``But I'm also proud that we stood up and fought 
our way out of it. There is a mental toughness in that and I don't 
think it will go away next year. It's like today's game _ we've been 
playing too good to end it on a bad note. And we went out and won 
it in the second half.'' Fassel would not elaborate on how he planned 
to retool his team, and he wouldn't name Kent Graham his starting 
quarterback for the 1999 season, even though there aren't many quarterbacks 
who lose their jobs sitting on a four-game winning streak. ``I'll 
just say this, I've been very happy with the way Kent has played,'' 
Fassel said of Graham, who won five of six starts at the season's 
end, throwing two touchdown passes to Chris Calloway in the second 
half Sunday to defeat the Eagles (3-13). ``Kent's always had the potential.'' 
Graham got an endorsement from one of the leaders on the Giants, linebacker 
Jessie Armstead, who credited him with being ``the navigator on that 
side of the ship.'' Referring to Strahan, Armstead added: ``Whoever 
is quarterback over there, he's going to have to answer to me and 
Michael.'' Armstead and Strahan are the Giants' only two Pro Bowl 
players, and Armstead said he plans to be especially vocal in trying 
to motivate the team next season. Armstead and Strahan addressed the 
offensive players during the team's midseason slump, with some ensuing 
rancor, but Armstead seemed to indicate he wouldn't wait that long 
if things soured next year. ``I'm going to be hard on people,'' Armstead 
said. ``We've got guys in their prime right now and we've got the 
next four years to do something with it. I'm not going to worry about 
stepping on people's toes any longer. ``If you aren't doing your job, 
you've got to answer to me and Michael.'' The Giants' 5-1 finish left 
most in the locker room believing that the team that concluded the 
season was the real Giants, not the one that stumbled out of the gate. 
``It's like today's game,'' Strahan said. ``We didn't start focused, 
but we finished strong and won.'' The Giants clearly started the game 
indifferently because they were affected by the news of their playoff 
elimination, something several players and coaches acknowledged. The 
Giants trailed at the half, 10-6. The high-water mark for the Eagles 
came in the second quarter when running back Duce Staley sliced through 
a huge hole in the right side of the Giants defense, dashing 64 yards 
for a touchdown. But in the second half, the Giants played with far 
more confidence and aggression, taking control of the game with two 
long touchdown drives. Each ended with a touchdown pass from Graham, 
who completed 15 of 26 passes for 133 yards and no interceptions, 
to Calloway. Giants running back Gary Brown, who had 112 yards on 
25 carries, went over 1,000 yards rushing on the first play of the 
first drive which closed out the third quarter. The running of Brown 
and fullback Charles Way, who punished the Eagles defense with 62 
important yards in 10 attempts, seemed to wear down the Eagles late 
in the third quarter. Midway through the Giants' first touchdown drive, 
Way bulled 20 yards off right tackle, carrying Eagles defenders on 
his back, and the Giants were in Philadelphia territory. Graham scrambled 
for 10 yards and then nearly connected with Calloway for a touchdown 
pass. Calloway was open in the right corner of the end zone, but Graham's 
pass just glanced off his fingertips. It seemed a golden opportunity 
lost, but on the next play the unflappable Calloway, whose unspectacular 
numbers mask his reliability, caught a tough pass over the middle 
from Graham for 21 yards. Three plays later, on a third-and-4 at the 
Eagles' 5-yard line, Graham rolled to his right out of the pocket 
and fired a pass intended for Ike Hilliard, who was standing at the 
right sideline in the end zone. Hilliard bobbled the pass as he fell 
out of bounds, but Calloway, coming behind Hilliard, caught the deflection 
and got two feet in bounds for the touchdown and the Giants' 13-10 
lead. ``Since I dropped one, I really wanted to get a chance at another 
one,'' Calloway said. ``I was Johnny on the spot. It wasn't a hard 
catch.'' The clinching touchdown followed in the fourth quarter. In 
the last sequence of an 11-play drive, Graham lofted an 18-yard touchdown 
pass to Calloway in the corner of the end zone. The Eagles' last attempt 
to get back in the game ended in the final minutes when Philadelphia 
turned the ball over on downs at the Giants' 7-yard line. ``That was 
not an easy game,'' Fassel said. ``Obviously, we expected more of 
the season and had some hopes for today. But in the end, the team 
wasn't willing to change course today. ``And while I'm disappointed, 
I do feel good about turning things around. I like the direction we're 
headed.''
