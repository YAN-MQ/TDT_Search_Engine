With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
Taking a look at temperatures coming up for Sunday, the high temperature 
readings in the northeast and New England, Ontario and Quebec, mostly 
in the 20s. In the interior west across the Rockies and four corners, 
20s and 30s can be found, but 70s in south Florida and south Texas. 
In our forecast weather picture, going into Sunday, more than likely 
into the evening hours, a strong pacific frontal system moves onshore 
for british Columbia, Vancouver island, Washington, Oregon and northern 
california. The rainfall could be heavy at times. Look for a bit of 
snowfall into the Great Lakes. A high expected on Sunday in Anchorage, 
Alaska, of 16 degrees. The extended forecast for Monday calls for 
still mild readings in the south central United States and into the 
gulf coast. On Tuesday, we'll expect some heavy rainfall into the 
mid-atlantic, and the cool readings will linger along the Canadian 
border states. And for Wednesday, 70s in the desert southwest, snow 
in New England. For more weather information, log onto CNN.com.
