In a striking admission of error, the Japanese government released 
a report on Sunday blaming official inaction and delay over the past 
decade for triggering the country's deepest recession since World 
War II. The year-end report by the Economic Planning Agency detailed 
the government's and private companies' failure to quickly come to 
grips with the collapse of the speculative ``bubble'' economy of the 
1980s. The troubles left over from the bubble, when real estate and 
stock markets soared to dizzying heights only to crash in the early 
1990s, have plagued the Japanese economy ``more than expected,'' the 
EPA wrote. The collapse in asset prices left behind a massive debt 
problem that has hobbled the Japanese financial system. But instead 
of moving quickly to resolve the bad loans, government and bank officials 
decided to ``leave the embarrassing problem untouched'' and hope for 
a recovery in prices, the report said. That recovery never came. Instead, 
the burst of the bubble brought a combined capital loss of 840 trillion 
yen (dlrs 7.2 trillion) between 1990 and 1996 to businesses and households, 
about 1.7 times the nation's gross domestic product in 1996, the EPA 
said. Altogether, the capital loss pulled down Japan's GDP growth 
rate by an average of around 2 percentage points each year between 
1991 and 1993, the report said. The negative effect on the GDP growth 
rate diminished to about 0.8 point per year from 1994 to 1996, it 
said. The losses strangled consumption and triggering Japan's worst 
recession since the end of World War II. The economy shrank for the 
first time in two decades last year, and unemployment in November 
was at a record high of 4.4 percent. ``The slow handling of the bad 
loans problem has caused various serious problems,'' a summary of 
the report said, including the credit crunch which still troubles 
many private companies. The EPA pointed to several reasons for the 
failure to act more quickly: optimism that prices would recover; uniform 
delay by banks in dealing with bad loans; lack of a system for bad-loan 
disposal; and lack of transparency in the financial system. In order 
to overcome the current economic slump, the EPA said Japan must get 
purge itself of the ``aftermath of bubble economy.''
