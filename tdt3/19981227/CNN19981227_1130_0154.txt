A tourist who was injured in an accident last week at Disneyland in 
california has died. Doctors removed the man from life support last 
night after declaring him brain dead. The man and his wife were struck 
by a metal cleat from the bow of a sailing ship after a rope tore 
it free. The wife is in fair condition. A park worker who was also 
injured remains in stable condition. State officials are investigating. 
They could fine Disney if any violations are found.
