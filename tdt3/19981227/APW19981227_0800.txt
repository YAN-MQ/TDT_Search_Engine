With his only serious rival for the party's leadership bowing out, 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu basked in the adoration of Likud's 
party faithful Sunday as he launched his campaign for the upcoming 
election. Netanyahu appeared confident and cheerful, a stark contrast 
to his agonized equivocation last week as parliamentary support for 
his security policies collapsed, precipitating elections likely to 
take place by June. His apparent weakness unleashed a week of furious 
speculation that he might not survive even as a leader of the Likud. 
That ended Sunday when Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, his chief rival, 
decided to bow out of the leadership race after failing to enlist 
the support of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. The only remaining 
challenger for the Likud leadership is Uzi Landau, 55, the hard-line 
chairman of the powerful Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
Landau is not likely to win, and has indicated that he knows it _ 
and is hoping to use his bid to force Netanyahu to make hard-line 
pledges during the leadership campaign. Landau told Israel television 
his campaign would force the party to become ``a Likud with principles, 
a Likud of backbone.'' When Netanyahu took the podium Sunday at a 
meeting of the Likud central committee, his internal support was virtually 
ensured and he was relaxed and smiling. To cries of ``Bibi, King of 
Israel,'' Netanyahu all but ignored internal challengers, instead 
looking ahead to elections. But many Cabinet members on the podium 
with Netanyahu were grim-faced. Mordechai, the defense minister, refused 
the opportunity to speak. He is still entertaining offers from the 
main opposition Labor party and a new centrist party, furious that 
Netanyahu reportedly offered the defense ministry to a popular general. 
Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister, refused to speak 
to reporters, and rushed out of party headquarters after the meeting. 
Israel radio reported that she is close to leaving the Likud to join 
a centrist party headed by a former Netanyahu finance minister, Dan 
Meridor. The meeting was called to determine when internal elections 
for the party's leadership and for its list of parliamentary candidates 
should take place. The dates were a foregone conclusion _ Jan. 25 
for party leader and Feb. 8 for the Knesset candidates _ but the meeting 
was a useful vehicle for Netanyahu to demonstrate that he still had 
a firm grip on the party machine. Netanyahu accused Labor of working 
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to ensure his defeat. ``We're 
working for a secure peace, but they say no,'' he said of the opposition 
Labor party. ``We'll go to elections, and we'll win in elections.'' 
Labor leader Ehud Barak accused Netanyahu of dirty politics. ``What 
we heard today was not a campaign speech,'' he said. ``It was incitement.'' 
Hard-liners were furious with Netanyahu for agreeing to further territorial 
concessions to the Palestinians at U.S. brokered peace talks at Wye 
River, Maryland in October. Doves in the opposition were angry with 
Netanyahu for freezing the Wye process last month in hopes of extracting 
further concessions from the Palestinians. Netanyahu's last-minute 
offer during last week's Knesset debate to set up a national unity 
government _ an about-face _ was seen as blatant opportunism and provoked 
loud laughter from both opposition and coalition legislators. Before 
making the offer, he appeared gripped by confusion _ approaching the 
podium to speak, then suddenly backing away. Meridor _ and other Likud 
defectors _ have said that their problem with Netanyahu is less with 
his policies and more with his personality. They accuse him of being 
obsessed with survival at all cost. Benny Begin, the son of former 
Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and one of the Likud's most staunchly 
right-wing members, has decided to leave the party and run as prime 
minister, heading a new rightist party. Speaking to Israel television, 
Meridor described Netanyahu's 2 1/2 years as prime minister as ``the 
collapse of leadership and political culture.''
