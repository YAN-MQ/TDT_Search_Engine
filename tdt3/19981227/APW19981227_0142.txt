A multinational committee that monitors a cease-fire in southern Lebanon 
on Sunday condemned the killing of seven Lebanese civilians and injuries 
to 16 Israelis in last week's hostilities. The group _ with representatives 
from the United States, France, Lebanon, Israel and Syria _ accused 
Israel and Lebanese guerrillas of violating the 1996 truce and renewed 
their call to both sides not to target civilians, according to a statement. 
The group met Saturday night to discuss a Lebanese complaint that 
was filed after an Israeli air strike killed a Lebanese woman and 
six of her children in the Bekaa Valley on Dec. 22. Israel called 
the civilian deaths an accident. It also took up an Israeli complaint 
that Hezbollah guerrillas retaliated by firing Katyusha rockets into 
northern Israel. An Israeli civilian was treated for injuries and 
15 others for shock. The statement, issued after a 12-hour meeting, 
said of the attack on Lebanon that ``the monitoring group condemned 
this grave incident, which led to such tragic and unacceptable consequences.'' 
The committee urged Israel to take ``effective measures'' to ensure 
that its military operations do not result in civilian casualties. 
It also condemned Hezbollah's retaliation and ``called upon Lebanon 
to ensure that Lebanese armed groups do no carry out such attacks,'' 
the statement said. The monitoring group was created as part of a 
U.S.-brokered cease-fire in April 1996 after a 16-day Israeli bombardment 
that killed at least 175 people, mostly Lebanese civilians. The understanding, 
which prohibits targeting civilians or firing from civilian areas, 
has been violated frequently. But the monitoring group has succeeded 
in containing hostilities. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party 
of God, is leading a guerrilla war to try to oust some 1,500 Israeli 
soldiers and their 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from southern 
Lebanon. Israel set up a self-styled ``security zone'' in southern 
Lebanon in 1985 to try to shield its northern towns from cross-border 
attacks.
