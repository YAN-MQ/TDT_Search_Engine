Some 50,000 Iraqi natives live in southern California. For one, this 
year's holy month of Ramadan means praying for loved ones imprisoned 
by the Iraqi government, and ordinary citizens who were hurt in "Operation 
desert fox." Jennifer Auther has the story. Imam mostafa Al-qazwini 
leads Ramadan prayers at the assadiq foundation, a Shiite Islamic 
center in Pomona, California. But this Ramadan, the most sacred time 
of the Muslim year, Al-qazwini's prayers have been pointed. We had 
huge gatherings for the safety of the Iraqi people -- not the Iraqi 
regime -- and also for all prisoners. Al-qazwini, his three children 
and wife hother live in exile. He left his home in karbala, Iraq, 
in 1971 as Saddam Hussein began to gain power. By phone, he checks 
on those he left behind in Iraq -- survivors. His grandfather, ayatolla 
sadiq Al-qazwini and 14 other relatives are imprisoned in Iraq, he 
says, because they defied Saddam Hussein's regime. Saddam Hussein 
has no respect for the month of Ramadan. Saddam Hussein never respected 
the religion. Saddam Hussein is the first man who violated the teachings 
of religion when he killed his own people. When he gassed them with 
chemical, biological weapons. During the 1980s, the Iraq/Iran war 
was waged during the holy month of Ramadan, a fact not lost on this 
imam. Throughout the year, we build up our bodies. The month of Ramadan, 
it's a time where we train our souls. We focus on allah, which is 
God. We focus on the holy Koran. It is also a time for reflection. 
I consider all Iraqi people as my family, and we pray for their release 
and their relief from this nightmare. Jennifer Auther, CNN, Pomona, 
California.
