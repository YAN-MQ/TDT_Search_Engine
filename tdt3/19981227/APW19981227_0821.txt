A natural gas pipeline exploded in a rural hamlet in northern Colombia 
on Sunday, killing at least 12 people, bringing down power lines, 
and setting homes on fire, authorities said. The blast in Arroyo de 
Piedra, a village in Atlantico State, 410 miles north of the capital, 
Bogota, also injured 80 people. Officials said they feared the death 
toll could rise. Authorities have not determined the cause of the 
explosion, but they said it appeared to have been accidental. There 
was no indication that leftist guerrillas who frequently sabotage 
oil pipelines were responsible. Television images from the town showed 
several charred bodies laid out in a cement courtyard, partially covered 
with white and colored bed sheets. Bandaged, burned children stared 
from hospital beds. Ruptured segments of the pipeline stuck out of 
a giant dirt crater left by the explosion of the underground pipeline 
in a humble neighborhood of wood and cinder block homes. ``I'm in 
intense pain,'' survivor Nadim Cera told the Caracol television network, 
fighting back tears. The fruit vendor lost his mother, two sisters 
and a cousin in the explosion which also critically injured his father. 
State health officials said nine people were killed immediately and 
three died later in area hospitals. Three of the dead and six of the 
wounded were children, they said. ``The explosion was so large it 
sent rocks flying and brought down power and telephone lines''' said 
Rafael Bohorquez, a local health official interviewed on Colombian 
radio. ``The nearby houses caught fire and their inhabitants have 
lost nearly everything.'' At least 50 homes were destroyed, Gov. Rodolfo 
Espinosa told reporters during a visit to Arroyo de Piedra. Police 
said the gas was turned off immediately after the blast and the fire 
brought under control. Sixty people remained hospitalized with serious 
burns and other injuries, officials said. ``Many of the patients are 
in critical condition at the moment,'' Danorella Valderrama, the state 
health department's emergency and disaster coordinator, told The Associated 
Press. At the University Hospital in Barranquilla, the state capital, 
12 patients were in stable condition with third degree burns over 
80 percent of their bodies, said Diana Sarmento, a hospital admissions 
official.
