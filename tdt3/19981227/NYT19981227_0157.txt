If this is what the playoffs are all about _ running the football, 
then running it some more _ then Curtis Martin proclaimed Sunday that 
he and the Jets were ready. When Martin signed for $36 million with 
the Jets in March, he asked for the ball as often as possible. Coach 
Bill Parcells promised to give it to him. ``I'd like to run the ball 
500 times,'' said the coach. ``And have Curtis run it 350.'' Since 
no Jets player had ever done that, it seemed like wishful thinking. 
Martin, though, ran 29 times Sunday. That lifted him to 369 carries 
for the season, and brought the Jets to an even 500. ``This was very 
significant,'' Martin said after gaining 102 yards. ``Once you get 
in the playoffs, everything's speeded up. You can build on things 
in the season, but not in the playoffs. You have to be ready going 
in.'' For Martin, it was his eighth 100-yard performance of the season, 
but it came after gaining fewer yards than that in three consecutive 
games. Then, last week, Parcells put everyone back in pads during 
workouts. ``We practiced four days last week,'' left guard Todd Burger 
said. ``Normally, we only practice three.'' The Jets had an extra 
day of work because their previous game, the division-clinching victory 
over Buffalo, was on a Saturday. ``I was 4-12 last year,'' said Burger, 
who had been dropped by Chicago. ``Now, I'm 12-4.'' Martin had come 
from the 10-6 Patriots to the Jets. He knew that the two games against 
New England would be important, both to the Jets and to him personally. 
``When the schedule came out,'' Martin said, ``I circled the dates.'' 
In the Monday night game at New England in October, Martin returned 
with a 107-yard rushing effort. Then he looked at the other circled 
date _ the regular-season finale. Did Sunday's victory have extra 
meaning? ``It would be a lie for me to say no,'' Martin said. ``I 
really wanted to win this game. People said, `Is this a relaxed game, 
you're already in the playoffs?' Naw, we were coming out full speed 
to beat the New England Patriots, and I'm glad we did.'' Then he reflected 
on the beginning of the season. ``Everyone was saying, `Curtis, are 
you going to take us to the playoffs?' '' Martin said. He told them, 
``I'm only one person, and I can't do everything.'' Now, he said, 
``Gratefully, we're in.''
