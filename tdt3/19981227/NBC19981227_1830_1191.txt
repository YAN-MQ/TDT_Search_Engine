In what critics are calling a year-end sweep, China's government sentenced 
another pro-democracy activist to prison today, the fourth in the 
past week. In Hong Kong, demonstrators marched to protest the mainland's 
latest crackdown on dissent. The man sentenced today, a labor activist, 
got ten years for giving an interview to the U.S.-backed radio-free 
Asia.
