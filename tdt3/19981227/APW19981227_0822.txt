A joint Australian-American attempt to fly a balloon non-stop around 
the world has been postponed due to high winds over the launch pad 
in Outback Australia. Team Re/Max, which planned to lift off from 
Alice Springs about 6 a.m. local time Tuesday (1900GMT Monday), will 
hold off until a high pressure system causing strong winds over central 
Australia is expected to weaken on Thursday or Friday. Bill Echols, 
the team's media spokesman, said ground and high altitude winds far 
exceeded safe launching conditions for the giant polyethylene balloon. 
``The surface winds currently are too strong for any kind of a balloon 
launch at this moment,'' Echols said. ``Conditions are expected to 
continue until Wednesday; winds which will be too high for a safe 
launch.'' Their non-stop expedition is expected to take 16 to 18 days 
and bring them back to Australia. Echols said the team hoped to succeed 
where others had failed by taking the high road _ floating on the 
outer edge of the atmosphere where predictable weather, the bane of 
previous attempts, should not be a problem. The space gondola will 
carry pilots John Wallington of Canberra and Americans Dave Liniger 
and Bob Martin on a quest to set balloon records including duration, 
distance and altitude. Echols said the launch would be affected by 
both surface winds and winds at altitudes of up to 300 meters _ the 
height of the balloon. He said the good news was the winds in the 
stratosphere had increased by one knot per day over the last several 
days, making it possible for the adventurers to cut hours or even 
days off their expedition. ``That's really a positive for us if they 
can get up there and catch those faster winds,'' he said. ``It will 
mean that we cut that many hours or days off the total flight.'' Echols 
said the crew would be ready to launch on Thursday or Friday. ``That 
really affords us a little more time to make sure the gondola is properly 
re-installed and all the systems are working properly,'' he said.
