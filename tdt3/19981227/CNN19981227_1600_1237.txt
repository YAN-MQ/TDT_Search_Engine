The friars Polish off the boilermakers. I'm Anthony Keith James, and 
this is "CNN Headline Sports." Jaraan Cornell missed three three-pointers 
in the final seconds that could have tied it on erron maxey's breakaway 
jam with four ticks left to help providence upset eighth-ranked Purdue, 
87-82. Jamel Thomas tossed in 22, maxey added 15. The friars improved 
to 7-4. The boilermakers fall to 12-2.
