They have seen the way he puts together a game plan and pulls every 
ounce of competitiveness out of his players. They have witnessed his 
yelling, his cursing, his posturing, and they have been inspired by 
his incredible thirst for excellence. And they have been to the place 
where all of the pressure and tension and passion he creates can get 
a team. So, no, the Patriots' Willie McGinest and Ty Law are not surprised 
at what Bill Parcells has done with the New York Jets. They expected 
as much when he left the New England Patriots two years ago to resurrect 
one of the most dreadful clubs in the National Football League. And 
though they were disappointed after Sunday's terrible performance 
at Giants Stadium, the Patriots' two stalwart defenders did not find 
it strange that a team with a 1-15 record in 1996 could pound them, 
31-10, two seasons later. ``Nobody's surprised at what Bill can do,'' 
said Law, the all-pro cornerback with a league-leading nine interceptions. 
``He's a great coach. He's going down as one of the greatest that 
ever coached any team. He turned this team around, and he's turned 
the Jets around. He's probably made two of the biggest turnarounds 
in teams in football history.'' Though McGinest and Law were not there 
when the best thing about the Patriots was their colorful uniforms, 
they know the yarn. New England was 9-39 in the three seasons before 
Parcells was hired and in the Super Bowl four years after his arrival. 
And they may also know, though they would never admit it, that since 
Parcells left their sideline, the Patriots (9-7) have become inferior 
to the Jets (12-4). Not only have the Jets under Parcells swapped 
places this year with the Patriots under Parcells _ American Football 
Conference East Division champions _but the Jets have a better mark 
over the past two seasons. The Jets are 21-11 with Parcells, and the 
Patriots, a Super Bowl team in 1996, are 19-13 without him. Sunday's 
rout was the Jets' third consecutive victory over New England. Even 
though the Patriots were the team playing for home-field advantage 
in the first round of the playoffs, the Jets displayed the sense of 
urgency that is indicative of a Parcells-led team. While the Jets 
executed with precision, the Patriots, who were playing without the 
injured star quarterback Drew Bledsoe, went through the motions like 
they were taking part in a pre-game warmup. New England, which plays 
at Jacksonville on Saturday, committed mistakes that revealed it had 
a letdown. Two of the most striking gaffes were by running backs Robert 
Edwards and Sedrick Shaw. In the second quarter, Edwards, a rookie 
who rushed for 1,102 yards this year, broke away for a big gain and 
then dropped the ball without being touched as he was racing down 
the sideline. Moments later, Shaw stumbled over his in the backfield 
for a 2-yard loss. Two years ago, with Parcells on the sideline, those 
things probably would not have happened. ``Just the aura and attitude 
about Parcells makes you hate to mess up for him,'' said McGinest, 
a defensive end who made his only trip to the Pro Bowl in 1996. ``He 
knows what he wants out of players, and he knows how to get what he 
wants.'' When asked if anything about the Jets reminded him of the 
Patriots of 1996, McGinest laughed and said: ``Yeah, all the players 
that are over there. Half of their players used to be here, and the 
whole coaching staff.'' The Jets' staff has six coaches and eight 
players who were with Parcells in New England. One of those players 
is halfback Curtis Martin, who spent his first three NFL seasons gaining 
3,799 yards for the Patriots. Martin said Parcells made it clear that 
half-stepping would not be tolerated Sunday, even though the Jets 
had nothing to gain in the standing or the playoffs. ``With his relentless 
attitude to win, he's not going to tolerate anything simple,'' Martin 
said. ``He's not going to tolerate a team that does dumb things. His 
favorite quote is `Smart players very seldom do dumb things.' He lives 
by that, and he makes sure that his team lives by that.'' Law played 
down the significance of facing so many former teammates, but said 
that seeing Martin and the others was special. ``Of course, it's going 
to bring some type of emotion,'' he said. ``Just because we went to 
the Super Bowl with some of those guys over there.'' Now, largely 
because of Parcells, those guys may be going to the Super Bowl without 
him.
