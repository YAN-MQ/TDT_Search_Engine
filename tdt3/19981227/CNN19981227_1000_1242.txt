Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports." We open things up on the gridiron, 
where you best watch your behavior because the cameras are rolling. 
Anyway, the Minnesota Vikings topped Tennessee 26-16 Saturday, and 
in the process, they became the highest scoring team in NFL history, 
with 556 points on the season. Gary Anderson finished the year without 
missing a field goal or extra point. His season total of 164 points 
is the most ever by a kicker. You certainly don't go into any season 
thinking you're going to make all your kicks, especially so many kicks. 
It's just been a real thrill for me to be part of this Minnesota Viking 
team.
