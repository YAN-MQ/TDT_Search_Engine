At a charity exhibition game in Atlantic City, N.J., 10 days ago, 
a half-dozen reporters surrounded Dan Wasserman, the communications 
director for the National Basketball Players Association, to find 
out where his boss, executive director Billy Hunter, was sitting. 
With a group of sheepish all-star players trying to patch their tattered 
public image, the state of the union was at issue. Were the players 
still united? Would the owners dare to scrap the entire season? And 
exactly what kind of outside influence is a certain prominent agent 
exerting on negotiations? ``Is it true,'' a reporter asked Wasserman, 
``that David Falk is running this . . . game?'' Falk, the agent for 
a fleet of superstars, including Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan, 
has been likened to a puppeteer during the league's six-month-old 
labor dispute _ pulling the strings of Hunter, his clients on the 
negotiating committee and, essentially, doing all he can to ruin professional 
basketball in America. Indeed, Falk had co-promoted the game. And 
after weathering a tidal wave of criticism for originally wanting 
90 percent of the proceeds to go to ``needy'' NBA players, he and 
the organizers switched gears and gave all of the nearly $1 million 
to local and national charities. But if the players were on the defensive, 
so was the man who brought them there. ``I've become a common target,'' 
Falk said. ``I don't like it. I guess the alternative is that I could 
have a very low profile. But that's not what our players want. They 
don't want us to hide, like some of these other people. I think it 
was Dante who said the hottest places in hell are for those who, in 
a moment of crisis, remain neutral.'' With less than two weeks to 
reach a settlement before Stern will recommend to the owners to cancel 
the season, Falk's relationship with the union is perceived by league 
officials to be one of the reasons the two sides cannot reach an agreement. 
The officials believe Falk's fear of having the league's highest salaries 
capped will cut into his power base so severely that the agent has 
greatly influenced the union's entrenched negotiating position. Though 
Falk has many middle-tier players among his 40 clients, he is clear 
about one issue: the marquee players are the essence of the game. 
``You take Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman away from 
the Bulls, and what do you have?'' Falk asks, before answering, ``a 
team that might not win the CBA. You take Stephon Marbury and Kevin 
Garnett and Tom Gugliotta away from Minnesota and what do you have 
left? Not much.'' Those comments back up Stern's charges of manipulation, 
and Falk has admitted he strongly advises Ewing, the union president, 
and his other clients on the committee _ Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard 
and Dikembe Mutombo _ about the collective bargaining process. ``Every 
time I see Patrick say something, it's almost like watching the Energizer 
bunny,'' said the agent Harold MacDonald, who represents Derrick Coleman 
and Terry Mills. ``I'm just waiting for Falk to put in another battery, 
and off Patrick goes again. Hardly any influence? Give me a break.'' 
But how much pull does Falk really have? Some union officials liken 
Falk to a dissenting mother at a PTA meeting, the quirky mom who can't 
seem to get anyone else to look at the world in the same way. ``Believe 
me, Falk's ideas are not the ideas of the union,'' said Ron Klempner, 
a union lawyer. ``To not use his experience would be foolish. He's 
great at what he does. But the problem with David is, sometimes he 
thinks he can make the arguments more eloquently than the next person, 
unaware that some of those arguments have been made over and over 
already.'' For his part, Falk claims he often goes days without speaking 
to union officials. ``I wish I had the influence people think I do,'' 
he said. ``And I don't see anything wrong with the influence I do 
have.'' ``Is Jeff Mishkin preventing David Stern from signing an agreement?'' 
he asked, referring to the league's chief legal counsel. ``When Bill 
Gates testifies before the justice department, he has an army of lawyers 
to accompany him. But when players have lawyers and agents and advisers, 
people attack them for not being intelligent. ``I'm not troubled when 
people say I'm Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan's mouthpiece, because 
that statement is born out of ignorance. What is insulting is for 
the media to suggest that Michael Jordan is Howdy Doody.'' A person 
close to Hunter who requested anonymity said the union chief rarely 
speaks to the agent, and he wonders if some of Falk's public statements 
have hurt the union more than helped it. The day the charity game 
was announced, Falk and some players began defending the notion of 
proceeds going to cash-strapped players, a move that backfired. ``We've 
tried very hard to keep public actions and comments of owners and 
players alike down to a minimum,'' said one league official on condition 
of anonymity. ``With one press conference, Falk turned the apathy 
of the lockout into a visceral reaction against our players. Remember, 
we have to sell this league when this is over.'' Falk admits that 
the original idea of giving 90 percent of the proceeds to the financially 
crimped players and 10 percent to charity was a mistake, the same 
way he said Stern imposing the lockout was a mistake. ``But it wasn't 
illogical to do something to help them out,'' Falk said. ``The owners 
have a tremendous financial cushion from the networks. Where is the 
players' cushion?'' Falk is not sure why he has become so unpopular 
during the lockout, surmising that Stern uses him as a scapegoat so 
he does not have to publicly excoriate Hunter. ``For obvious reasons,'' 
Falk said, the inference being that Falk, as the white, loose-cannon 
agent, was more politically correct to blast in the media than the 
black union executive director. When asked if that is how he felt, 
Falk replied, ``That's an interesting theory. Nobody's written about 
that yet.'' He also sees himself as one of the union's lone messengers 
of truth, trying to stave off the NBA's propaganda monster. ``The 
players union has one young man doing p.r., while the NBA has a well-oiled 
machine churning all the time,'' Falk said. ``I'm not promoting myself. 
I'm promoting players' position. I don't like it. There are people 
who love the fight. I don't. I don't relish the contest. At the same 
time, you can't be reluctant to engage. That's the price we pay for 
the guys we represent.'' Martyr or megalomaniac, some of the backlash 
he has received recently may have nothing to do with the lockout. 
Falk can sometimes alienate almost as well as he can negotiate. The 
same flippant arrogance that has caused NBA general managers to curse 
Falk's name does not always go over well with the public, either. 
Callers to the Washington office, of FAME _ Falk Associates Management 
Enterprises _ are often forwarded to his self-aggrandizing voicemail. 
This month's offering: ``Hello, this is David, with my end of the 
year message: ``It's just weeks before Christmas and all through the 
halls, not a creature was stirring, there was no basketball. ``The 
children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of Jordan 
danced in their heads. ``And mama had a scowl and daddy a pout, 'cause 
their favorite players were all locked out.'' Stern was not amused, 
saying: ``Billy Hunter is not having fun during this lockout. I am 
not having fun during this lockout. But I see David Falk, and there 
he is on `Nightline' and on `Larry King Live.' I don't know how, but 
he seems to be enjoying the lockout.''
