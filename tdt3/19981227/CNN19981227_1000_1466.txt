Keiko the killer whale appears to be adapting well to his new home, 
a Floating bay pen just off the coast of southern Iceland. His trainers 
say the star of the "free willy" movies no longer requires hand feeding, 
and doesn't seem fazed by storms anymore. They're hoping to release 
Keiko into the wild someday. He spent years in captivity at an aquarium 
in Oregon.
