President Clinton's impeachment trial will proceed, but the likely 
result will be censure, not conviction and removal from office, several 
senators said Sunday. ``We'll have a trial and there will be censure 
and then, God willing, there'll be closure,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, D-N.Y., in an appearance on the NBC News program ``Meet 
the Press.'' Senators making the Sunday talk-show rounds said in varying 
ways that a trial was inevitable, and some said a vote on the two 
articles of impeachment passed by the House of Representatives must 
take place. But none of them expressed the belief that Clinton could 
be convicted by the constitutionally required two-thirds majority 
of the Senate, or 67 votes. ``We're going to have to probably begin 
the trial,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who serves as chairman 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He added, ``At that point, I think 
if our colleagues on the other side show that there are at least 34 
people who will never vote for impeachment or conviction,'' the best 
option would be censure. ``I don't think anybody would deny the statement 
that we probably don't have a two-thirds vote to convict the president,'' 
said Hatch, speaking on the CBS News program ``Face the Nation.'' 
``Then it seems to me we're going to have to do what is the next best 
thing, and that is point out to the American people how really bad 
his actions were.'' The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota, said on ``Meet the Press'' that there was ``a sense among 
many senators that while the offenses may not reach the impeachable 
level, there is some sanction that should be applied here, some form 
of punishment, and censure is a very serious, very historic and rare, 
form of punishment that ought to be considered.'' No senator predicted 
that the extraordinary business of putting a president on trial, which 
has taken place only once in American history, was likely to end in 
Clinton's conviction and removal from office. ``We ought to vote on 
these articles of impeachment, and then that is the appropriate time 
to consider a censure,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on ``Fox 
News Sunday.'' ``Assuming neither of those articles pass,'' he said, 
members of the Senate must ``negotiate the censure alternative.'' 
Hatch and McConnell agreed that a trial involving lengthy and potentially 
embarrassing appearances by witnesses like Monica Lewinsky and Linda 
Tripp was unnecessary. ``There's no reason for this to take three 
to six months,'' Hatch said. ``It could, if people start calling witnesses, 
but I don't see any reason to call those witnesses. I think the president 
has already admitted to some very terrible things.'' McConnell said, 
``It's not at all clear to me that we have to put on a sort of public 
show trial and bring all of these rather infamous characters in to 
testify before the American public.'' And Sen. John Breaux, D-La., 
said on ``Face the Nation'' that ``a long-drawn-out, protracted debate 
and long-drawn-out trial complete with witnesses ends up punishing 
the country more than it punishes the president.'' The sentiment among 
many Democrats in the Senate is in favor of censure. Many senators 
on both sides of the aisle have said they want some form of trial 
on the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from 
the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, which were passed 
in a vote along party lines by the House of Representatives. Some 
have said they feel obliged to take the matter to trial following 
the House vote. All are aware of the prevailing public sentiment that 
the matter should be brought to a close. ``I think the American people 
have told us that they want some place where Bill Clinton can be held 
accountable, where he can atone for what he has done, where he can 
get the punishment that he is due,'' the president's former spokesman, 
Mike McCurry, said on ``Meet the Press.'' The blot of impeachment 
will always be with Clinton, no matter what course the Senate takes, 
McCurry said. ``That is going to be with him forever,'' he said, ``and 
that is _ believe me, for someone who loves the presidency and loves 
that White House and is a student of it _ that will hurt him a lot 
forever, when he's down in Little Rock at his library.''
