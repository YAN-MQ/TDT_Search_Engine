Saudi Arabia is lobbying to postpone this week's emergency meeting 
of Arab foreign ministers scheduled to discuss the showdown between 
the United States and Iraq, Arab diplomats said Sunday. The meeting, 
due to be held Wednesday in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, was called 
by Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid in the wake of 
last week's U.S.-British military attacks on Iraq. Abdel-Meguid said 
Sunday that 14 of the 22 Arab foreign ministers have accepted his 
invitation. His diplomatic initiative followed a call by Yemeni President 
Ali Abdullah Saleh for an an Arab summit to forge a united Arab position 
after the attacks. But Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Saudi Arabia sent its chief diplomat, Prince Saud al-Faisal, 
to Cairo on Sunday to ask Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to back 
its demand for putting off the meeting until the end of the Muslim 
holy month Ramadan in mid-January. Egyptian officials would not confirm 
the Saudi envoy's visit. Iraq wants the Cairo meeting to back its 
demand for the lifting of the crippling U.N economic sanctions that 
were imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Saudi Arabia 
is apparently worried that the Arab states may give Iraq the much 
needed backing in its confrontation with the United States and Britain. 
Egypt's influential Al-Ahram newspaper reported Sunday that the Gulf 
states of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia's allies, 
will send their foreign ministers to the meeting in Cairo. Also on 
Sunday, Iraq submitted a draft resolution to a meeting of Arab legislators 
in Jordan urging Arab nations to ignore the U.N. sanctions on Iraq 
and demanding that all foreign troops be pulled out of the Gulf.
