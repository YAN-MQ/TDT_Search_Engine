``Enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no 
friends.'' ``Because a woman is 35 or more, romance in life need not 
be over.'' ``That's a joke, son!'' ``That ain't the way I heee-e-e-ard 
it, Johnny.'' ``Well...'' Anyone who can immediately identify these 
quotations is either a trivia collector or a radio baby, as Gerald 
Nachman refers to those of us who grew with our ears plugged in to 
a table-top Philco while our eyes were affixed on homework. Until 
I read Nachman's captivating, highly personal book, ``Raised on Radio,'' 
I didn't realize _ or remember _ just how much a generation was conditioned 
by that ubiquitous box of sounds, or how radio shaped our language, 
conversation and dreams. Of course, there were also double features 
to look forward to on Saturday afternoon, but as a daily diet, radio 
brought cultural nourishment and escapism into the home: comedians, 
cowboys, superhero serials, quiz shows, crooners, cliffhangers, sports 
and even news (but only when it interrupted this broadcast). With 
the amplitude of a Ken Burns television documentary and with the added 
asset of a keen sense of comic proportion, the author takes the reader 
step by step through the story of radio, which he calls ``the ultimate 
populist medium.'' Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear 
where the weed of crime always bears bitter fruit and the mailbox 
is stuffed with secret decoder rings: not just adventures with Jack 
Armstrong and Hop Harrigan, but also with Margot Lane and Lorelei 
Kilbourne, those super-efficient sidekicks. My introduction to drama 
was not on Broadway but with ``Lights Out,'' `Suspense''' and ``The 
Lux Radio Theater,'' which during its 21-year history ``presented 
virtually every movie and play of note'' in cut-down and ``occasionally 
cut-rate'' versions. The stars of one's theatrical childhood were 
Les Tremayne (later replaced by Olan Soule) and Barbara Luddy, those 
eternally optimistic First Nighters who never failed to have their 
tickets ready, please. Nachman finds heroes (George Burns and Gracie 
Allen, Jimmy Durante and, especially, Jack Benny, the quintessential 
radio comedian), along with several (Eddie Cantor, Red Skelton) he 
disdains for their selfishness. A niche of honor is reserved for the 
iconoclasm of Fred Allen, who once joined Orson Welles in doing a 
five-minute ``Les Miserables,'' in which ``Welles has all the lines 
as Jean Valjean and Allen's Javert is reduced to knocking on doors 
and blowing a police whistle.'' When it is pertinent, we hear about 
personal lives (the satyric side of Bob Hope), but principally the 
book is concerned with what happened on the air and just behind the 
scenes. Along the way, Nachman savors the absurdities: a mediocre 
ventriloquist who became a radio star by playing straight man to a 
dapper dummy. (And why was he wearing a monocle?) ``The Shadow'' was, 
he says, the oddest and wealthiest of crime-busters: ``It was almost 
as if Donald Trump were to lead a secret life fighting crime in New 
York dressed in fruity blue tights and boots.'' In discussing ``The 
Green Hornet,'' he wonders, ``Why a hornet?'' and ``Why green and 
not yellow?'' Then there is the mystery of the Lone Ranger, called 
the Long Ranger in Nachman's schoolyard. ``You only Ranger left,'' 
said Tonto in the first episode after rescuing the lawman from a massacre. 
What if the show had been called ``The Only Ranger''? Tonto, by the 
way, was played for many years by an elderly Shakespearean actor, 
who, we are told, tended to doze off during episodes, once leaving 
the Masked Man (Brace Beemer) to improvise a monolog. Radio was the 
land of the color-blind and the ageless, where two white actors could 
personify Amos 'n' Andy, and where Mel Blanc and other clowns with 
limber voices could move from show to show and create a galaxy of 
contrasting characters. In sitcoms, special mention is reserved for 
Eve Arden's pre-feminist ``Our Miss Brooks,'' ``the first bright, 
independent, unmarried, working female comic character on the air,'' 
someone who didn't need Boynton to make her life complete. Even while 
he quotes Bob and Ray twitting ``One Man's Family'' as ``One Feller's 
Family,'' Nachman recognizes the reason for the longevity of Carlton 
Morse's serial, which, he says, was inspired by ``The Forsyte Saga.'' 
It depicted the day-to-day life of an average family with a naturalness 
and a reasonable degree of sophistication. As the author demonstrates, 
the most memorable shows, like ``The Jack Benny Show'' and ``Dragnet,'' 
broke the mold, a lesson still not learned by television. At the same 
time, he is clear about the arc of broadcast history, how Charlie 
McCarthy led to Kermit the Frog, how ``Duffy's Tavern'' begat ``Cheers.'' 
Radio programs were ineluctably identified with their sponsors and 
their announcers. As the author says, ``Nearly every radio baby can 
still sing or whistle the peppy Rinso White tune'' and dozens of other 
jingles. Among the fascinating sideline characters are Anne and Frank 
Hummert, writers and producers who filled daytime radio with everything 
from ``Just Plain Bill'' to ``Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons.'' Nachman 
links the writers Arch Oboler, Norman Corwin and Himan Brown as theatrical 
giants of radio. Himan who? A man of many shows, he invented ``Inner 
Sanctum'' and its creaking door, which, as he predicted, became a 
star, and one of the most famous sound effects (along with Fibber 
McGee's closet). Just as sound movies replaced the silents, television 
silenced radio as we knew it. As Nachman understands, it was the most 
intimate of experiences, one place a child could go unaccompanied 
by an adult. It was a theater of our imagination. There have been 
many books on the subject, but none that I know of that is written 
with such verve and joyful sense of rediscovery. The answers, by the 
way, are ``Boston Blackie,'' ``The Romance of Helen Trent,'' Senator 
Claghorn on ``The Fred Allen Show,'' the Old-timer on ``Fibber McGee 
and Molly'' and, if you don't know who said, ``Well...,'' think it 
over. PUBLICATION NOTES: `RAISED ON RADIO' By Gerald Nachman Illustrated.
