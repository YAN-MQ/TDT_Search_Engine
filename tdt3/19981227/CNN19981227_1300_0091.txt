President Clinton is applauding today's release of new crime figures. 
He says the survey shows violent crime in the United States fell about 
7% last year to its lowest level since the report was started 25 years 
ago. President Clinton issued a statement that says the new figures 
"again show that the strategy of more police, stricter gun laws and 
better crime prevention is working."
