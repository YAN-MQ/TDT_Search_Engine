Eight supporters of a dissident cleric have been arrested, the weekly 
Aban reported on Sunday. It said that seven of the supporters of Grand 
Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri were detained for distributing pamphlets 
calling for his release from house arrest. The eighth, Abasali Fateh, 
an associate of Montazeri, also was taken into custody, the paper 
said. It did not give a reason for his arrest. All eight are clerics, 
the paper said. It did not say when they were detained. The arrests 
were ordered by the Special Court for the Clergy, the paper said. 
Last November, Montazeri was publicly repudiated after he questioned 
the legitimacy of rule by the clergy, including Iran's powerful spiritual 
leader Ali Khamenei. Khamenei accused him of treason and, days later, 
hard-liners attacked Montazeri's home and office in Qom, forcing him 
to flee under police protection. Montazeri has been confined to his 
house in the holy city of Qom since the middle of last year. He is 
allowed no visitors and in February, a court ordered the freezing 
of his bank account. Montazeri was once heir apparent to the late 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
But he fell from grace for being too critical of Khomeini's hard-line 
policies and was put under house arrest just before Khomeini died 
in 1989. Later freed, he maintained a low profile, speaking out only 
occasionally against human rights violations. He has a wide following 
as a religious leader among Iran's 60 million people.
