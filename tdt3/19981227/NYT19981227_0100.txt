Part 2 of the confrontation between Dominik Hasek and Martin Brodeur 
will be staged Monday night in Buffalo, two days after the Sabres' 
goalie emerged as the victor the first time around. Hasek put on a 
brilliant exhibition of goaltending Saturday night in New Jersey as 
Buffalo scored a 2-0 victory. Brodeur was just as good in goal for 
the Devils, but he allowed one goal _ the other came late in the game 
on an empty net _ and that was all Hasek needed. ``It's always fun 
to play against the best,'' Brodeur said of his latest confrontation 
with Hasek, who turned aside 34 shots Saturday night. ``We have to 
find a way to beat them. We have to find a way to get through to Hasek.'' 
Bobby Holik, who had seven shots against Hasek, and Petr Sykora, who 
had four, said they know the way to beat him. ``What we have to do,'' 
Sykora said, ``is create traffic in front of him, make a screen so 
that he doesn't see the puck. It's tough to score against him when 
he sees the puck.'' Holik said of Hasek: ``They have the best goalie 
in the world, and we have to put ourselves in front on him. He's so 
good because he sees the puck.'' Knowing what to do against Hasek 
and actually doing it are two different things. Ask Sykora, the talented 
young wing, who has 10 goals this season for the Devils. The Devils 
had several good chances against Hasek, but the best might have belonged 
to Sykora. It came with six minutes left in the second period and 
the game scoreless when Sykora entered Buffalo's zone with speed from 
right to left. ``I cut into the middle and I had him beat,'' Sykora 
said. ``But I was falling down and couldn't get it upstairs. If the 
shot would have been high, I would have scored.'' Having to switch 
from side to side, Hasek found himself on his back. Sykora flew by 
Hasek and tried to lift the puck, but he was unable to because he 
went sprawling near the bottom of the left circle. The puck ended 
up in Hasek's possession. ``I don't get intimidated by him,'' Sykora 
said. ``He's just another goalie in the league. It's just a little 
more challenging to score against him.'' Goal scorers around the National 
Hockey League have found out how difficult it has been to score against 
Hasek in recent years, but this month he has been virtually impossible 
to beat. Hasek has started every game this season, the only goaltender 
in the league to do so. He played 11 games this month and has lost 
once, a 3-2 decision to the Carolina Hurricanes. He also had a 2-2 
tie with St. Louis. In the nine games Hasek won this month, he allowed 
a total of six goals, and his shutout of the Devils was his fourth 
in December. Hasek's shutout on Saturday was also his second in a 
row, seventh of the season and 40th of his career. He has a stretch 
of 163 minutes 35 seconds without allowing a goal. His goals against 
average is 1.60 for the season, and he is already being touted as 
the favorite to capture his third consecutive Hart Trophy as the league's 
most valuable player. No other goaltender in the history of the league 
has captured the Hart Trophy more than once. But Hasek would probably 
let Brodeur have all the trophies and honors that he has amassed in 
exchange for having his name on the Stanley Cup. Brodeur may have 
lost some battles against Hasek, but he still has a winning record 
against him and he was the winner in the only playoff series in which 
he faced the Sabres' goalie, in 1994. Buffalo (19-6-5) and the Devils 
(19-9-4) are leading their respective divisions and are almost certain 
to be playing hockey deep into the spring. But Holik observed: ``It's 
too early to talk about playoffs and comparing teams. So much can 
happen between now and April.''
