Convicted killers on the loose. They broke out of a maximum security 
prison near Nashville, Tennessee, early this morning. Fear quickly 
spread through communities near the prison. Helicopters joined the 
Hunt. And police tried to tighten a noose around the area, setting 
up roadblocks, checking as many cars as possible. Four of the six 
men are convicted killers, but all are considered dangerous. The rush 
to freedom began when two inmates jumped a guard. He was put down 
in a chair and immediately he was -- eventually he was restrained 
with leg restraints and handcuffs. a second guard was also overwhelmed. 
Neither was hurt. The inmates used the guard's keys to free their 
friends. Officials say that one of the prisoners was not convicted 
but awaiting trial. The two inmates who triggered the prison break 
had been allowed out of their cells before dawn for a special meal 
marking the Muslim holiday of ramadan.
