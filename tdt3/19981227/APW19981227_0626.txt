Size does matter _ at least as far as Colombian AIDS activists are 
concerned. The activists paraded an enormous inflated condom through 
the streets of the country's third largest city Sunday hoping to draw 
attention to the threat of AIDS. ``The idea is for people to realize 
that the disease exists, that it's here, and that it represents a 
far greater threat than the condom we're displaying,'' Dr. John Jairo 
Palacio told reporters. The mock prophylactic, which weighed roughly 
three thousand pounds (1,500 kilograms), stretched over a half-mile 
(one kilometer) down a holiday street fair in Cali, a city of two 
million inhabitants. Dozens of police escorted the giant birth control 
device, guarding against possible punctures. The huge plastic condom 
was the idea of doctors specializing in sexually-transmitted diseases 
at the Santiago de Cali University and workers from drug rehabilitation 
programs. Palacio said the condom took two months to build at a cost 
dlrs 13,000, and was paid for by the university and a condom manufacturer. 
The Health Ministry reported 170,000 people have tested positive for 
AIDS in Colombia, whose population is about 40 million. The number 
of afflicted persons could increase to 190,000 by the year 2000 unless 
condom use increases, the Ministry has said.
