Iraq is urging all Arab nations to ignore the U.N. trade embargo against 
baghdad, and demand the removal of international troops from the Persian 
gulf region. The Iraqi government made these calls for action in a 
resolution submitted today at a meeting of the Arab parliamentary 
union in Jordan. Recent American and British air strikes against Iraq 
have resulted in widespread protests in Arab countries. But their 
governments continue to support sanctions, which were imposed after 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
