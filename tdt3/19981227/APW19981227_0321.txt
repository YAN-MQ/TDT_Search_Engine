Security has been tightened on Switzerland's main Alpine rail crossing 
following three bomb threats from an anonymous caller demanding a 
large payment, state police said Sunday. The 15-kilometer (9 1/2-mile) 
Gotthard tunnel, on a key north-south route between Germany and Italy, 
was closed for two hours Friday and searched following the first threat. 
Ticino state police confirmed a report in Zurich's SonntagsBlick weekly 
that the caller, who spoke in Italian, demanded 1 million Swiss francs 
(dlrs 730,000) from Swiss Federal Railways. The route remained open 
following two further telephone threats Saturday, after police in 
the states of Ticino and Uri reinforced security.
