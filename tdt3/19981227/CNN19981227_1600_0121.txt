It's been two years since Jonbenet Ramsey was found murdered in the 
basement of her parents' Colorado home. To date there have been no 
arrests. Irene O'Connor of affiliate kwgn has more. From the start, 
it was anything but a run of the mill murder case. A 6-year-old beauty 
queen is found dead in her own home in Boulder. Her parents become 
suspects. They hire attorneys and their own P.R. person. A media frenzy 
explodes around the case. Now, two years later, the mystery continues. 
The further we go from the date of the crime, the less chance there 
is that ultimately there will be justice in the case. It was slow 
going from the start. The Boulder police, with hardly any experience 
investigating murders, didn't secure the scene. They didn't interview 
the ramseys immediately. And John Ramsey was allowed to move his daughter's 
body. Police investigators, the district attorney's office, they're 
still trying to play catchup for the mistakes that were made in the 
first few hours of the investigation. This year, two veteran detectives 
assigned to the case resigned because they disagreed with the way 
the case was being handled. And in September, a grand jury convened 
to investigate. The evidence that is in the public domain now tends 
to point towards the parents. Former Denver district attorney Norm 
early says even though two years have passed, there's still a chance 
an arrest can be made if the grand jury concentrates on evidence that 
shows a coverup in the murder. If you can conclude, as a reasonable 
grand jury, that no one person could have staged this scene by themselves, 
then there is very likely the possibility that the grand jury could 
indict both the mother and the father. Hey, how you doing? The defense 
attorney, David Lane, says 1999 probably won't bring justice for Jonbenet. 
He predicts the grand jury won't indict anyone. I think the only way 
this case is going to break is if somebody who thus far has been silent 
comes forward and says, "I know what happened there. This is what 
happened, and I can prove it." In Denver, I'm Irene O'Connor, for 
CNN.
