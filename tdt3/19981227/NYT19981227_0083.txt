It was to be the film in which the Dreamworks SKG partner Jeffrey 
Katzenberg would step out of Michael Eisner's shadow _ an animated 
story with a huge box office, just like ``The Lion King'' and other 
hand-drawn hits that Katzenberg helped oversee before his bitter split 
with Eisner and Walt Disney Co. several years ago. But this film, 
``The Prince of Egypt,'' was also to be something more: a movie with 
a serious theme that audiences would recognize as raising the art 
of mass-market animation to a new level. Yet, while the Christmas 
weekend ticket sales should please Katzenberg _ the animated story 
of Moses has held up at the box office in the face of intense competition 
from holiday films _ many people in Hollywood say that two weeks after 
its release, the movie is not showing signs of becoming a megahit. 
``It's still early,'' said an executive with a major theater exhibitor, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But `Prince of Egypt' didn't 
do the kind of opening that forecasts a $100 million film.'' The $100 
million benchmark is significant, because industry estimates place 
the film's cost between $75 million and $100 million. And Dreamworks 
is widely thought to have spent as much as $50 million to promote 
it. But whether it was a matter of misjudging the public's appetite 
for a serious animated film during the holiday season or simply running 
into heavy competition that may be fragmenting the audience, or perhaps 
even exposing new fault lines in the animation market, Katzenberg 
and Dreamworks have found that it is not easy to out-Disney Disney. 
After opening on Dec. 18 and averaging $4,496 a screen, or $14.5 million 
in its first weekend, by Sunday afternoon executives of Dreamworks 
were forecasting $15.3 million for its second weekend, a number that 
several top- level industry executives at other studios said they 
found overly optimistic. Using the Dreamworks numbers, that brings 
the total to $40.2 million since the movie opened. And an executive 
close to Dreamworks who requested anonymity said he was convinced 
the film would gross more than $100 million. Others put the final 
figure at $80 million to $90 million in the United States. Although 
the film is clearly a critical success, the latter figures would not 
seem to put it on track for the kind of financial success of two lighter-hearted 
holiday-season animated offerings. Viacom's ``The Rugrats Movie,'' 
which opened at $10,065 a screen and grossed $76.8 million after four 
weeks, cost a mere $25 million to make. Meanwhile, Disney's ``A Bug's 
Life,'' which opened at $12,360 a screen and has taken in nearly $100 
million for the same period, is the biggest hit of the group and cost 
about $40 million. Though movie studios keep only about half of the 
box office gross, once a film reaches a critical level, movie company 
executives can project how much a film will reap from sales in cable, 
videocassettes and other markets. If they know the film's cost and 
marketing expenses, they can use those projections to estimate when 
it will reach profitability. Because Dreamworks has kept its costs 
a well-guarded secret, it is hard to gauge how much money ``Prince 
of Egypt'' would make if it did $85 million at the U.S. box office. 
Katzenberg, the executive producer of ``The Prince of Egypt,'' reached 
by telephone Sunday in Hawaii, where he was vacationing, declined 
to comment. The movie is not the first animated film from Dreamworks, 
a company founded with much fanfare in 1994 as a partnership of Katzenberg, 
the record-industry magnate David Geffen and the filmmaker Steven 
Spielberg. In early October, Dreamworks released ``Antz,'' a computer-animation 
movie similar in look and theme to ``A Bug's Life,'' but like ``Prince 
of Eqypt'' aimed somewhat above the kiddie crowd. ``Antz,'' which 
cost an estimated $42 million and at the time of its release had the 
animation field to itself, opened to a respectable $7,020 a screen. 
The film has long since broken into the black, grossing $87.9 million 
as of last weekend, and is likely to turn a good rofit. But for Dreamworks, 
there is perhaps much more riding on ``Prince of Eqypt,'' a film aimed 
at Disney's forte _ hand-drawn animation. The effort devoted to making 
and marketing the movie indicate that Katzenberg's motivations in 
building an animation division are based on much more than an ego 
battle with Eisner. ``Animation is the source of money that will make 
Dreamworks work,'' an executive at a rival studio said in an interview 
earlier this year. That is because the profit margins for animated 
films are generally much higher than for live-action movies. Not only 
do animated films often generate sales of related products, but they 
do not depend on costly stars who take either a big share of the upfront 
money or a percentage of the box office _ or both. The absence of 
stars also means that the budgets for sequels are not burdened by 
the demands of ambitious actors in search of ever higher payouts. 
As Katzenberg well knows, it is a business model that his former employer, 
Disney, has pursued long and profitably. David Londoner, a media analyst 
at Schroder and Co., explained the math this way: ``If Disney invests 
$10 in a live action film, they are lucky if they can return $12 or 
$13 that they can keep. For an animated film, they expect to keep 
at least $25 on a $10 investment. In both cases, the return includes 
profits from soundtracks, videocassettes and merchandising.'' In the 
case of animated films aimed at children, of course, merchandising 
often means tie-ins with retailers who are eager to turn a movie's 
anticipated popularity into an occasion to sell more of their own 
products. And the cross-promotion can feed back into the popularity 
of the film. Diageo PLC's Burger King, for example, has spent an estimated 
$25 million to promote ``Rugrats.'' And McDonald's had a similar promotion 
for ``A Bug's Life,'' which one Disney executive said was worth about 
$30 million in advertising. But Dreamworks did not forge any McMoses 
Fun Meal-type links for ``The Prince of Egypt.'' (Industry accounts 
vary about whether this was because Dreamworks did not want to seem 
to cheapen a biblical theme, or because the fast-food chains had qualms 
of their own.) The sole merchandising tie-in is a deal with Wal-Mart 
Stores, which is selling copies of the film's soundtrack that include 
two coupons redeemable for a movie ticket. A Dreamworks executive 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 1.6 million of these 
packages were produced for Wal-Mart, and that only 20 percent have 
been cashed in, assuring box office demand from the remaining tickets. 
Terry Press, the Dreamworks marketing chief, said the studio had been 
tweaking its advertising strategy to bring in more families and children, 
after an opening weekend in which a full 49 percent of those attending 
``The Prince of Egypt'' were adults not accompanied by children. ``I 
have shifted things to be more family-targeted, because we already 
bring in the adults,'' she said. During the opening weekend, for example, 
newspaper ads for the movie evoked a museum poster _ an iconic silhouette 
of the Moses character, inset with a far-off view of the Great Pyramids. 
This past weekend, the movie ads evoked a superheroes cartoon, depicting 
a chariot drag race between a youthful, bare-chested Moses and the 
youthful, bare-chested Pharaoh-in-waiting, Rameses. Ms. Press disputed 
industry estimates that Dreamworks had spent $50 million promoting 
the film, saying the true figure was closer to $30 million. She blamed 
the discrepancy on the fact that most industry analysts are based 
in either New York or Los Angeles and tend _ incorrectly, she argued 
_ to extrapolate estimated expenditures in those cities to the rest 
of the country. ``We spend more in those markets because we are trying 
to impress the industry,'' she said. Of course, in this battle of 
animated holiday films, paid advertising has been more crucial to 
Dreamworks than to Disney or Viacom, which can both rely on the so-called 
synergies of cross-media ownership. To coincide with the release of 
``A Bug's Life,'' for example, Disney produced a half-hour syndicated 
television program about the making of the film. The program was carried 
on ABC's own stations and on many ABC affiliates. And The Disney Channel, 
a cable service, has been running ``Prince of Egypt'' promotions. 
Viacom took an even more direct line of attack with ``Rugrats.'' Viacom's 
Paramount film studio produced the movie, which is based on the animated 
series that appears on Viacom's Nickelodeon cable channel. For months, 
a promotion for the film has appeared at the end of every ``Rugrats'' 
television episode. And in the final week before the ``Rugrats'' opening, 
Viacom pre-empted the show each evening, replacing it with an episode 
of the cartoon series ``Hey, Arnold!'' with an on-screen notice that 
``The Rugrats have gone to Hollywood!'' Dreamworks, strictly a film 
and television studio and music company, has few opportunities for 
such promotional synergies. Whatever the eventual box-office, overseas 
and video-release revenue from ``The Prince of Egypt,'' Dreamworks 
will presumably remain intent on pursuing the lucrative potential 
of the animation business. The company will release ``El Dorado'' 
in about a year and ``Chicken Run'' after that. But Katzenberg's experience 
with this initial attempt to outdo Disney has proved instructive.
