About 45 million people hit the road, or the skies, for the holidays 
this year. And with Christmas weekend now winding down, many will 
begin to make the trek home. Traffic should begin to intensify today 
at airports, train stations and on the highways, and will likely remain 
heavy all week. It could be especially rough going at the nation's 
airports on Wednesday, when the air transport association estimates 
1.74 million passengers will fly. Another 1.5 million will wait until 
new year's eve to make their trip. And 1.62 million will hold off 
until new year's day.
