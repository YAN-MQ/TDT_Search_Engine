E.T., phone your agent. Madison Avenue is calling. E.T., the anthropomorphic 
alien whose exile on Earth and journey home were chronicled in the 
popular 1982 film ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' will be the focus 
for a coming campaign by Arnell Group Brand Consulting in New York 
for Progressive automobile insurance. The campaign, which is intended 
to sell safe driving rather than insurance policies, will be broad 
based, ranging from a 60-second commercial to appear before the halftime 
show of Super Bowl XXXIII and materials for driver's education courses 
to Internet advertising and an ``E.T. Safety Club'' for children. 
``It's natural to use E.T. as a teacher, a champion, for driving-safety 
issues,'' said Bob McMillan, marketing director at the Progressive 
Corp. in Cleveland, the nation's fifth-largest auto insurer. ``E.T. 
is, after all, a progressive being,'' he added, laughing, ``a higher 
life form.'' The campaign, which begins on Jan. 9 with teaser television 
spots in National Football League playoff games, represents the most 
widespread marketing effort involving E.T. Despite the huge, sustained 
appeal of the film _it ranks among the 10-highest-grossing movies 
ever and still sells steadily on home video _ E.T. has been seen only 
sparingly in ads and promotions or on licensed merchandise. As such, 
the campaign is emblematic of the increasing cross-pollenization between 
the popular and commercial cultures, particularly in terms of so-called 
classic characters. Among others that are joining or rejoining E.T. 
in the commercial realm are Eloise, the mischievous 6-year-old living 
at the Plaza Hotel, and the myriad characters like the Grinch and 
the Cat in the Hat created by Dr. Seuss. ``You can get to a point 
where you cross the line, overmerchandise, use the character in ways 
that don't seem appropriate,'' said Brad Globe, marketing head for 
Amblin Entertainment in Universal City, Calif. ``Ultimately, the consumer 
decides.'' Amblin, owned by Steven Spielberg, co-produced the film 
with the Universal Pictures unit of what is now the Seagram Co. In 
this instance, Globe said, he and Spielberg were receptive to the 
campaign concept when it was presented by Arnell and Progressive in 
late summer because ``E.T.'s becoming the ambassador for highway and 
traffic safety, preventing accidents, buckling seat belts, fighting 
drinking and driving,'' was an idea ``that isn't exploitive, that 
stays true to who the character is.'' Spielberg, who was also the 
director of ``E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial,'' said in a statement: 
``E.T. holds a special place in so many hearts. I'm extremely pleased 
that the values symbolized by E.T. will be used to aid and address 
the issue of safe driving.'' Those concerns were also paramount among 
executives at Progressive, McMillan said. ``We have to be sensitive 
to the way people feel about the character,'' McMillan said, ``and 
make sure E.T. is seen working on what's an appropriate mission for 
him.'' ``A safety message that's fresh and relevant, especially to 
kids, is a great way to use the power the character has,'' he added, 
``and makes it a perfect association for us.'' Amblin signed a multiyear 
contract for undisclosed terms, McMillan said, giving the insurer 
rights to use E.T. in the campaign as part of efforts to ``increase 
the public's awareness of our products and services.'' The budget 
for the campaign is also not disclosed. When the film was released, 
there had been what was for that time a comprehensive merchandising 
campaign, which included E.T. books, video games, clothing, dolls 
and cereal. And there was, of course, the bonanza enjoyed by the Hershey 
Foods Corp., which in a landmark product placement deal agreed to 
provide Reese's Pieces as the candy used by a boy to cement a friendship 
with the space creature. Since then, there have been sporadic E.T. 
campaigns, involving the Special Olympics; the Pepsi-Cola Co. unit 
of Pepsico Inc., for the 1988 release of the home video, and Sears, 
Roebuck &AMP; Co. , for broadcasts of the film in the early 1990's. 
The character also continues to promote the Universal theme parks 
in California and Florida. ``We've been very selective, very particular, 
over the years, doing only limited marketing programs with E.T.,'' 
Globe said, because ``Steven at a certain point just decided that 
because of how special he feels toward the character and film not 
to do more merchandising with E.T.'' ``And there was also more of 
a focus on other movies we were making,'' he added, like the Indiana 
Jones, ``Back to the Future'' and ``Jurassic Park'' films, which were 
``pretty aggressively marketed'' and generated multibillion-dollar 
merchandising payoffs. But now, Globe said, ``we're trying to do some 
things to keep E.T. out there in front of people,'' especially for 
``a whole new generation of kids with a lot of different characters 
vying for their attention.'' The campaign helps ``to bring back E.T., 
alive and fresh,'' he added, ``doing positive things.'' The campaign 
will coincidentally revive E.T. four months before the return of other 
famous space characters: the ``Star Wars'' contingent, who are being 
brought back by George Lucas in the first of several new films. The 
E.T. campaign features an icon in the style of a traffic sign, created 
by Arnell, which became the agency for Progressive in August. The 
sign, in yellow, depicts a drawing of E.T., his familiar lighted digit 
upraised, wearing a seat belt. ``Buckle up,'' it urges. ``E.T. is 
a character of such fame and power, about healing and love,'' said 
Peter Arnell, chairman at Arnell. ``He's a metaphor for traffic safety.'' 
``If you can get kids to buckle up early on,'' he added, ``it could 
significantly reduce the death rate.'' The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration is trying to raise the percentage of seat-belt 
use by 2005 to 90 percent from 68 percent. The campaign will be part 
of Progressive's sponsorship of the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXIII, 
to be televised on Jan.3 by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of the News 
Corp. The trade publication Adweek reported that Progressive paid 
$5 million to become an NFL sponsor. There will also be ``an extensive 
Internet presence,'' McMillan said, on the Progressive Web site (www.progressive.com).
