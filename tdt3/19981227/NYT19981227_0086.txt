Southern sea otters, the playful darlings of the central California 
coast, appear to be diminishing in number at a rate that perplexes 
and worries scientists. A twice-yearly survey released recently by 
the biological resources division of the U.S. Geological Survey showed 
1,937 otters along the 300 miles of coast. This fall's count represents 
a 12 percent decrease since the fall of 1997, and the fewest otters 
since a record high of 2,377 in the spring of 1995. The otter census 
has been conducted every May and November since 1982. Scientists in 
Monterey, Calif., the epicenter of sea otter studies in California, 
fear that the decline may signal a new danger for the health of the 
species, which was hunted almost to extinction in the 18th and 19th 
centuries by fur hunters who sought their luxurious pelts. Early in 
this century a small colony of otters was discovered in the Big Sur 
area south of Monterey. The current population grew from that colony. 
Otter experts are not sure what the drop in numbers means for the 
health of the species, now and in the future. The only certainty is 
that if subsequent counts drop below 1,850, the otters' designation 
on the Endangered Species List would shift from threatened to endangered. 
Andy Johnson, manager of the sea otter rescue and conservation program 
at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, said it would be premature 
to attribute the population drop to any one factor. ``We don't yet 
have any really solid clues as to what's behind these lower counts,'' 
Johnson said, adding that the change could be part of a natural cycle. 
But pollution and disease are prime suspects. ``We're looking closely 
at what might be getting into the food system, getting ingested and 
winding up in the tissue of the otters,'' Johnson said. The sea otter, 
a top predator in the near-shore ecosystem, often swims on its back 
and in this position eats its meals of abalone, crabs and sea urchins, 
sometimes using a rock to smash open the shells. Because of its high 
metabolic rate, necessary to keep it warm in the cold waters of the 
Pacific Ocean, the otter eats from a quarter to a third of its body 
weight every day. Adults weigh 10 to 25 pounds. Up to 40 percent of 
dead otters _ most found washed ashore _ had some type of infection 
or parasite, and some have contained chemical contaminants like PCBs 
and DDT. ``The fear is that we are doing something to the near-shore 
ecosystem,'' Johnson said, ``or that some immune suppression is making 
them more susceptible to infectious diseases.'' Not far from the Monterey 
Bay Aquarium, at the offices of Friends of the Sea Otter, an advocacy 
group, its science director, Jim Curland, echoed Johnson's worries 
about the otters. ``The sea otter population is clearly in decline 
and we have to do something to reverse the trend,'' Curland said. 
``Something is not right in the waters, and there needs to be more 
research and lots more funding for that research.'' Curland likened 
the plight of the sea otter to that of the California condor, which 
was near extinction before a program was established to breed the 
birds in captivity. In Alaska, northern sea otters _ larger cousins 
of the southern sea otters _ are also declining. Since 1990, as many 
as 45,000 North Pacific sea otters have been eaten by killer whales. 
As the number of harbor seals and sea lions have declined in Alaskan 
waters, the whales have shifted their feeding from the open ocean 
to coastal areas where the otters live and feed.
