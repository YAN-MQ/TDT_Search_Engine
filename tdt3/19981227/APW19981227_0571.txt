India's national minorities commission Sunday urged the government 
of the western state of Gujarat to ensure that violence against Christians 
is not repeated when radical Hindu groups hold rallies and demonstrations 
across the state. The demonstrations are scheduled for Monday. Christian 
groups have asked for police protection in some parts of Gujarat where 
there have been more than 40 instances of violence against the community 
this year. The most recent violence was during Christmas when Hindu 
zealots attacked two Catholic schools, one hospital and three churches, 
reports said. Three women were also injured when attackers allegedly 
threw stones as they returned from church. On Sunday, More than 1,000 
Hindu right-wing activists held a demonstration in a village in central 
Gujarat where they distributed pamphlets asking Christian missionaries 
to stop conversions and urged Hindus who had converted to return to 
their faith. Christians say the violence is being fanned by Hindu 
right-wing groups closely linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. 
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has condemned the recent attacks. 
His government denies there is any orchestrated anti-Christian campaign.
