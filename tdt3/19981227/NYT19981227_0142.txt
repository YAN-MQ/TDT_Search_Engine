Merwin Kaminstein, a former retail executive, died on Dec. 21 at Massachusetts 
General Hospital in Boston. Kaminstein, a resident of Boston and Bonita 
Springs, Fla., was 63. The cause was cancer, said his niece, Gail 
Cohen. Kaminstein headed several department-store companies starting 
in 1971, when he became president of Donaldson's, part of Allied Department 
Stores. From 1976 to 1979, he was president of another Allied store 
chain, Jordan Marsh. He also served as president of Filene's and Rich's 
department stores, both owned by Federated Department Stores, between 
1979 and 1987. In 1990, after two years in the real-estate industry, 
Kaminstein was named chairman and chief executive at Brookstone, a 
chain of specialty stores based in Nashua, N.H. He retired as chief 
executive in 1995. After graduating from Hofstra University in 1956, 
Kaminstein began his career in retail at Abraham &AMP; Straus in New 
York, worked at Federated's headquarters in New York from 1967 to 
1971 and then joined Donaldson's. Kaminstein is survived by his wife, 
Janet, of Boston and Bonita Springs; two daughters, Susan Street of 
Atlanta and Ann, of Washington; two sons, Greg, of New Boston, N.H., 
and Steve, of Noxen, Pa.; a sister, Nancy Tulis of Atlanta, and four
