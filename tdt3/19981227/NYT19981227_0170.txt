With another desperate finish Sunday, the Arizona Cardinals and quarterback 
Jake Plummer ended the longest playoff drought in the National Football 
League, defeating the San Diego Chargers, 16-13, on a 52-yard field 
goal by Chris Jacke as time ran out. The victory at Sun Devil Stadium 
locked up the final National Football Conference wild-card berth for 
the Cardinals, who will play next week on the road against the Cowboys, 
who beat Arizona twice this year. The victory also touched off a celebration 
by the sellout crowd of 71,670, with dozens of fans trying unsuccessfully 
to tear down the goal posts through which Jacke's game-winner sailed. 
The Cardinals, then playing in St. Louis, last appeared in the playoffs 
in the strike-shortened 1982 season. Only four current Cardinals had 
been born when the team made its last post-season appearance in a 
complete season, 1975. The Cardinal franchise has won only one playoff 
game. It occurred 51 years ago Monday in the NFL title game against 
Philadelphia. ``We're very, very thankful for where we are,'' said 
the Cardinals' coach, Vince Tobin, whose team blew leads of 10-0 and 
13-3. ``Just getting in the playoffs was a goal at the beginning of 
the year because it hadn't happened in a long time. For me, it's only 
a first step. I'm happy, but not satisfied.'' Jacke's third field 
goal of the game came after Chargers quarterback Craig Whelihan, who 
was picked off four times by Cardinals safety Kwamie Lassiter and 
whose team trailed virtually throughout, rallied the Chargers with 
16 seconds left on a 30-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Thelwell. That 
capped a 68-yard drive that started with 1 minute 55 seconds remaining. 
``Sixteen seconds is a lot of time when you have Jake,'' Lassiter 
said of Plummer, who has nine of these late victories in two NFL seasons. 
Eric Metcalf returned the ensuing kickoff 46 yards. Plummer then completed 
a 10-yard pass to Frank Sanders to put the ball on the San Diego 34-yard 
line. With three seconds left, Tobin sent in the field-goal unit. 
To that point, Lassiter had offset San Diego's league-leading defense, 
which frustrated Plummer and held the Cardinals to one touchdown, 
a disputed score by former Jet Adrian Murrell, and a pair of field 
goals. San Diego outgained Arizona in total offense, 377 yards to 
270, but finished the season at 5-11, losing their last five. The 
victory gave the Cardinals (9-7) their first winning season since 
1984. Because of victories by the Giants and Tampa Bay earlier in 
the day, the Cardinals had to win to make the playoffs. ``You get 
tired of hearing that it's the longest streak without a playoff game,'' 
Plummer said. ``I wasn't even alive back then. This is a new deal, 
a new team, a new attitude. We want to make an impact, do something 
special.'' Arizona struck first in the game _ at least according to 
Tom Stabile, the head linesman, who ruled that Murrell scored a 4-yard 
touchdown. Television replays showed that Murrell _ despite a slashing, 
second-effort run and lunge _ was stopped short of the goal line by 
safety Greg Jackson. Plummer completed three passes for 65 yards on 
the nine-play drive, the pivotal one a 36-yard flea-flicker in which 
Plummer handed off to Murrell, took his lateral and lobbed a completion 
to Rob Moore over the middle. Plummer, the 24-year-old from Arizona 
State who became the second-highest-paid player in the league when 
he signed a four-year, $29.7 million contract last week, completed 
20 of 41 passes for 274 yards. Whelihan was 16 of 40 for 214 yards, 
and the Chargers committed five turnovers. As he has for the past 
several weeks, Whelihan started for June Jones, the Chargers' lame-duck 
interim coach, over Ryan Leaf, the $31.25 million rookie who was taken 
with the second overall pick in the most recent NFL draft. The Chargers 
obtained that pick in a trade with Arizona.
