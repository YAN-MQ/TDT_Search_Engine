Ernie Accorsi woke up Sunday morning feeling a rush of adrenaline 
and butterflies of possibility. The Giants' fragile playoff hopes, 
held in the slippery fingers of the Cincinnati Bengals, had life. 
A Bengal victory over Tampa Bay would keep hope alive. Despite years 
of pragmatism, Accorsi allowed himself to dream. Hey, you never know. 
``By the time I left the hotel parking lot, Tampa Bay had already 
scored a touchdown,'' he said. An hour before the Giants' game started, 
Tampa was up by three touchdowns. By kickoff, the Giants' playoff 
hopes were crushed. Last season at this time the Giants had just defeated 
Washington to clinch the conference championship. ``That was a euphoric 
afternoon,'' Accorsi said. ``This could have been an exciting day, 
too. Turns out that it's not.'' So Accorsi sat in the Eagles' chilly 
press box Sunday afternoon, alternating between a philosophic view 
of a disappointing season and the bottom-line pragmatism of a general 
manager. ``Progress isn't always a straight line,'' he said. ``Sometimes 
you make a right turn. Let's just hope this was a right turn.'' That, 
of course, is the multimillion-dollar question facing a flagship franchise 
that in the course of one season celebrated its 1,000th game and the 
40th anniversary of a historic National Football League championship 
game. The Giants began the Jim Fassell era at the same time that the 
Jets began the Bill Parcells era; the Giants made the playoffs that 
first year and the Jets did not. Now the Jets are a Super Bowl hopeful 
while the Giants suffered a horrendous free fall, salvaging a .500 
season with a 20-10 victory over woeful Philadelphia. So Sunday afternoon, 
as the Giants' season ended, Accorsi's body was in Philadelphia but 
his mind was racing months ahead, to dispersal pools, minicamps, all-star 
games, personnel evaluations. All this to answer the general manager's 
ever-present, unanswered question: How do we get better? ``Unfortunately, 
in this business you're always thinking ahead,'' Accorsi said. He 
related a conversation he had this summer with Brian Cashman, the 
Yankees' general manager, after the Yankees clinched their division. 
``I told him, `I guess you don't have anything to worry about.' He 
said, `The general manager's job is to worry.' He's right: the general 
manager's job is to worry all the time. ``We need to score points. 
We need to become more explosive. We have to re-group, go back to 
camp and improve ourselves.'' Starting Monday, the coaching staff 
will evaluate the season. The front office and coaches will meet next 
week; then there will be an all-encompassing meeting with the scouting 
staff, coaches and front office in February. Accorsi will attend the 
Senior Bowl, then either the East-West game or a new all-star game 
in Orlando, Fla. He will attend the league's combine camp in Indianapolis 
in late February. On the team front, Accorsi has to decide how to 
contend with the restricted free agents Conrad Hamilton, Roman Oben 
and Amani Toomer and the unrestricted free agents Chad Bratzke, Lance 
Scott, Gregg Bishop and Corey Widmer. Next week Accorsi has to decide 
which five players to expose for the dispersal pool for the new Cleveland 
franchise. ``We have to make decisions quickly,'' Accorsi said. ``This 
is a very changeable league; you can get better or worse a lot faster 
now. There's no time to reflect. It's hard to be patient in an impatient 
environment.'' Which is the Giants' reality: the 1997 Giants who reached 
the playoffs or the 1998 Giants who fizzled in the middle and came 
on with a push that was too little too late? ``Given where we were 
a few weeks ago, when we were 3-7, I think what we've done is quite 
an accomplishment,'' Accorsi said. While executives sit and watch 
and measure the long haul, the players play and by definition look 
at the short term. What goes through a player's mind on a frosty December 
day in a game that held so much promise at the outset, now reduced 
to futility? ``Sadness,'' said Bratzke, the Giants' right defensive 
end. ``I enjoy this game so much. It kind of gets you down. I wanted 
to keep playing.'' For Hugh Douglas, the Eagles' defensive end, the 
feelings are more conflicted. A year ago Douglas was with the Jets 
on the eve of a great season. Now the Jets may be bound for the Super 
Bowl, and Douglas, who came to Philadelphia to play for Ray Rhodes, 
lost a season and probably a coach. ``Sometimes I think `what if,''' 
Douglas admitted. ``But this is a business and I am a professional. 
I'm going to be a professional.'' This is a day when everyone says 
farewell; no one is quite sure where the road leads, only where it 
has been. ``I thought about how I could have made one more play here 
or there,'' Bratzke said. ``I think of about 100 plays, 99 I did perfectly, 
I think about the one play I missed.''
