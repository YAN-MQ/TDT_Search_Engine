The first group of west African peacekeeping troops has arrived in 
Guinea-Bissau as part of a November peace pact to end a five-month 
civil war in the tiny west African country, news reports said. Seventy 
troops from Togo arrived Saturday in the capital of the former Portuguese 
colony and more were expected Sunday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa 
said. Guinea-Bissau erupted in civil war earlier this year when the 
country's top military commander, Ansumane Mane, led a revolt against 
President Joao Bernardo Vieira. About half the country's population 
of 1 million was displaced by the fighting that raged in the capital 
and spread to inland areas over five months. The warring sides signed 
a cease-fire pact Nov. 2 and agreed to have troops from ECOMOG _ the 
Economic Community of West African States Military Observer Group 
_ monitor the treaty. Troops from the West African force will also 
provide security for relief agencies working near Guinea-Bissau's 
northern border with Senegal.
