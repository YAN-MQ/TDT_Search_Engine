Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy is expected to be out for at least a 
week with a sprained knee he suffered in last night's loss to the 
stars. The team doesn't know when he hurt it. He began to feel discomfort 
in the first period, but did not leave until allowing the stars the 
final goal of the game in the third. Backup Craig Billington will 
be in goal tonight when Colorado plays calgary. And that's just one 
of two games on a light schedule on the ice. The Oilers, who have 
won just once in its last ten, host Vancouver.
