David Stern met with union head Billy Hunter in ``an attempt to salvage 
the season'' and made what the NBA commissioner called the league's 
final offer. In a sign that chances are small for a settlement before 
the NBA's Jan. 7 ``drop-dead date'' for canceling the entire 1998-99 
season, Stern said Sunday that the owners' latest offer produced little 
progress. ``This was not enough for the union,'' Stern said. ``We 
advised the union that no further offers from the NBA will be made.'' 
The union had no immediate response following the five-hour meeting 
in Denver. ``In an attempt to salvage the season, we made additional 
improvements in our offer,'' Stern said, adding that the league proposed 
to increase the percentage of revenue to be shared with players, the 
proposed maximum salary, the rookie salary scale and the minimum salary. 
The league also proposed an additional exemption to the salary cap 
and accepted the union's 10 percent limitation on the escrow arrangement. 
NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre said that both sides came out of the 
latest session with a sense of frustration and admitted they remain 
far apart. Stern, along with deputy commissioner Russ Granik and special 
assistant Bob Lanier, took part in the bargaining session. Players 
were also represented by the Knicks' Patrick Ewing and lawyer Jeffrey 
Kessler. The meeting developed following Wednesday night's secret 
session in Los Angeles between Stern and Hunter. Hunter planned to 
return to New York later Sunday. No further talks are scheduled with 
10 days remaining until NBA owners meet Jan. 7 in New York. Stern 
said if no deal is reached by then, he will recommend the cancellation 
of the season to owners. Some agents have been advising Hunter to 
hold off until the deadline before trying to close the deal. The sides 
are still unable to come to terms on how to distribute some dlrs 2 
billion in annual revenue. In order to salvage a 45 or 50-game schedule, 
a deal must be made by mid-January.
