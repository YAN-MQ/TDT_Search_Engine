The government has granted the imprisoned head of a major opposition 
group permission to fly to the United States for medical treatment 
after several months of deteriorating health, the Ethiopian News Agency 
said Sunday. Asrat Woldeyes, president of the All-Amhara Peoples Organization, 
is serving a five-year sentence on charges of encouraging armed insurrection 
in two speeches. He was being tried on a third similar charge. But 
the government said Sunday it was temporarily dropping the third charge 
against Asrat because of his poor health. The 69-year-old British-educated 
surgeon suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes that is severely 
affecting his eyes. The personal physician of the late Emperor Haile 
Selassie is a strong critic of the government of Prime Minister Meles 
Zenawi. He is particularly critical of policies that have led to the 
creation of new autonomous regions along linguistic and ethnic lines. 
Asrat collapsed on his way to court earlier this year, and after a 
week of insistent appeals by his supporters, the government hospitalized 
him. His doctors have appealed to the government to allow him to travel 
overseas for treatment. No information was immediately available on 
Asrat's date of departure or destination in the United States.
