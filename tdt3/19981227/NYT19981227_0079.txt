Doug Herzog is, he admits, a cable guy. His 18-year career in television 
has been spent almost exclusively working for the most identifiable 
cable names in the business, from CNN to MTV to Comedy Central. He 
has done almost everything in cable short of entering homes and installing 
wires. Now he has decided to make a change so startling that even 
he describes it as ``virtually a negative of my life so far.'' He 
is going to broadcast network television, taking _ in his new position 
as president of Fox Entertainment _ one of the signature jobs in network 
television: chief programmer. ``I have been raised, as it were, to 
battle the networks and disparage the networks,'' Herzog said in an 
interview recently at the Cosmic Coffee Shop on Broadway in Manhattan. 
At 39, he is assuming the job at a time of almost unparalleled upheaval 
in the executive ranks of network television. Half the top network 
programmers have left their jobs since the current television season 
began. Ratings continue to decline across the board as networks struggle 
to find hit shows to break through the ever more competitive prime-time 
landscape. Program costs are soaring and profits plummeting. His appointment 
is seen as particularly intriguing because of the ways he might change 
Fox. Herzog, who oversaw such irreverent breakthrough shows as ``Politically 
Incorrect'' and the raunchy ``South Park,'' does not come from the 
talent pool that has traditionally produced network programmers: executives 
from the network's own entertainment-development staffs or the television 
studios that supply the programs. Fox has sought to position itself 
as the network that seeks to break the old network rules, but this 
is the first time even Fox has stepped outside the familiar Hollywood 
program-development hierarchy to select an executive without one day 
of network or studio experience. Even the location of the interview 
spoke to Herzog's deep cable roots. The Cosmic has been something 
of a seminal site in the history of cable television, the place where 
early executives from MTV met to hatch plans to start shows like ``Real 
World'' and ``Unplugged,'' and more recently where executives from 
Comedy Central (now in MTV's old office space in the same building 
as the coffee shop) have met to ponder how to take advantage of the 
merchandising windfall from ``South Park.'' Herzog acknowledged that 
he had paid almost no attention to the programming of network television 
while running Comedy Central. ``Quite honestly, I make no bones about 
it,'' he said. ``Over the past 3.5 years I've watched nothing but 
Comedy Central and Yankee games.'' If he thought anything about network 
television shows, he said, it was mostly to express disdain for them. 
``When you see so many resources, so much money being spent, as a 
cable guy you just get frustrated that there's so little quality,'' 
he said. So what is this deep-dyed cable executive, who has spent 
his whole career to this point disparaging network television, doing 
taking control, on Jan. 11 officially, of a network's prime-time schedule? 
He is, essentially, defining a network strategy that has taken another 
longtime cable executive, Scott Sassa, formerly of the Turner cable 
channels, to the same top programmer's job at NBC, a strategy that 
goes along the lines of ``If you can't beat 'em, hire 'em.'' Fox executives 
pointedly described the selection of Herzog in those terms, saying 
they were seeking to bring in a fresh thinker, one unencumbered by 
associations with what increasingly is seen as a hidebound network 
system of programming. If that is this case, Herzog said, they are 
getting precisely what they want in him. ``You could make the argument 
that I'm unqualified for this job,'' Herzog said. ``Certainly in terms 
of network program development.'' Citing the modest amount of work 
he has been able to do in trying to get himself up to speed on the 
forthcoming pilot crop at Fox, he said, ``In just the past couple 
of weeks I've probably read more scripts than I have in the past year.'' 
He acknowledged that he faced ``a huge learning curve on the mechanical 
side of this job.'' ``I will oversee the production of more pilots 
in the next 120 days than I have for the entire 3.5 years I've been 
at Comedy Central,'' he said. ``The question for me is will the things 
I've been able to do successfully on the cable end, will they translate? 
That's really the million-dollar question.'' What Herzog has been 
able to do on the cable end is, though on a smaller scale, the same 
thing Fox wants him to do: establish successful regular series. Herzog 
remembered clearly the precise moment his career as a programmer started. 
He had joined MTV in 1984, while that was still a nascent channel, 
looking to put down firm roots. His position was news director, which 
reflected a bit of his background. He had started as an intern at 
CNN, though he admitted, ``I hated hard news.'' His interest really 
was entertainment news; he had started such a show at CNN before leaving 
to work a short stint as a producer on the syndicated series ``Entertainment 
Tonight.'' ``I feel like with what I did at CNN and `Entertainment 
Tonight' and then MTV, I helped develop that infotainment show-biz 
news thing,'' Herzog said. ``Though I'm not all that proud of that.'' 
In his early work at MTV he helped establish some news inserts amid 
what was then a regular format of music videos. At some of the regular 
meetings of the channel's executives, Herzog said he agitated for 
``doing something more than just videos.'' Those requests were ignored 
until one day when MTV's first president, Robert Pittmann, called 
a meeting. ``Well we've got to do some shows,'' Herzog said, doing 
a better-than-passable imitation of Pittmann's nasal delivery. ``We 
need some show to get the ratings up. So, Herzog, I need some shows 
on the air in six weeks.'' As there was so little time to work with, 
the goals had to be modest. Herzog thought of a game show. It turned 
out to be ``Remote Control,'' one of the early breakthrough series 
for the channel. ``All at once I'm a programmer,'' Herzog said. Other 
shows followed: ``The Video Music Awards,'' ``The Movie Awards,'' 
``Real World,'' ``Unplugged.'' MTV, which had been almost exclusively 
a ``lifestyle'' channel, defined by its emphasis on music and music 
culture, suddenly had regular series with regular audiences and regular 
advertising sales. At MTV, Herzog gained a reputation as both an innovative 
programmer and a solid business executive. Both qualities helped land 
him the job at Comedy Central, a channel whose lack of signature programming 
was matched by its lack of identity. ``A lot of people thought he 
was crazy to go to Comedy Central,'' said one of his executive colleagues 
at MTV, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The channel was a joke, 
but nothing on it was funny. It seemed like a waste of his talents.'' 
But Herzog saw it an an opportunity. In cable, even small improvements 
can pay off in big ways. Through some skillful acquisitions like the 
British comedy ``Absolutely Fabulous'' and some attention-getting 
original programs like ``Politically Incorrect,'' Herzog made some 
quick impact at Comedy Central. Then came ``South Park,'' an irreverent, 
vulgar, often hilarious cartoon from two recent college graduates 
in Colorado, and both Comedy Central and Doug Herzog were hot commodities 
in the television business. This fall he got an exploratory call from 
a Fox executive, to which he reacted with what he called ``shock and 
denial.'' He had no plans to leave Comedy Central. ``I was having 
success there and had reason to think I would continue to have success.'' 
Among other negatives, there was his personal situation, a happy New 
York lifestyle for him, his wife and three young children. Having 
grown up in Paterson, N.J., (where he was one of the few Jewish graduates 
of Paterson Regional Catholic High School, which he attended because 
of the less than inspiring state of the public schools there at the 
time), Herzog was totally uninterested in a job that would require 
him to move to Los Angeles. And yes, there was that other little negative 
about network television: ``It meant joining a network,'' he said. 
``It's a dying business. Why would I do that?'' Then came the reconsideration. 
``It's still one of the premier jobs in television, albeit not what 
it was when Brandon Tartikoff was programming NBC. Still, at the end 
of the day you're in every home. The networks still have an enormous 
advantage. They've just got to figure a way to get more people into 
the room.'' Fox was appealing, he said, because it meant joining more 
than just a network. ``NBC and CBS are in the network business,'' 
Herzog said. ``Fox is in the television business.'' With its own studio, 
its cable networks, its global reach, ``I was getting into the vertically 
integrated television business,'' he said. And now that he has joined 
them, what does Herzog think he can do to stave off the march toward 
extinction for the networks? ``I think what I bring is an environment 
where risk-taking is really encouraged,'' he said. ``My experience 
at places like MTV and Comedy Central will be helpful in terms of 
risk taking: Where can you go and how far can you go? That's a skill 
I'm going to develop. ``I think I come without the traditional point 
of view in terms of developing programs, and ultimately that's where 
the rubber meets the road. You can say what you want, but it's a business 
of hits. If I can come up with some hit shows for these guys it's 
going to work out great. And if I can't, it probably won't.''
