Thousands of rebels in Colombia say conditions are right to start 
peace talks with the government. Rosemary church has more on the possible 
impact on the country. The revolutionary armed forces of Colombia 
said on Saturday they're ready for peace talks set for January 7th. 
Hundreds of the Marxist guerrillas have moved into a recently demilitarized 
area of the Colombian jungle. The occupation fulfills one of the conditions 
demanded by the rebels to begin peace negotiations. On Saturday, the 
guerrillas -- known by the acronym farc -- arrived in buses and cars 
to occupy the area. Leading the rebel troops was farc commander Joaquin 
Gomez. Just days earlier, president andres pastrana had pulled the 
last of his soldiers out of this area. Farc is the oldest and largest 
rebel group in the western Hemisphere, with about 12,000 members. 
The guerrillas have battled government troops and ultraright-wing 
paramilitaries for three decades. The civil war has killed some 35,000 
people in just the last decade. But starting January 7, there is at 
least a chance for peace. Rosemary church, CNN.
