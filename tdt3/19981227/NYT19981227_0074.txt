A volunteer working to persuade South Africans not to discriminate 
against HIV-infected people was beaten to death last week by her neighbors, 
who accused her of bringing shame on their community by revealing 
that she was HIV-positive. The killing scared other anti-AIDS advocates 
and said it proved what they have said for years _ although 3 million 
South Africans are infected with the virus that causes AIDS, nearly 
all are afraid to admit it because of the hostility they face. The 
woman killed, Gugu Dlamini, 36, a volunteer field worker for the National 
Association of People Living With HIV/AIDS, went public on World AIDS 
Day, Dec. 1, speaking about her HIV infection on Zulu-language radio 
and on television. Since then, according to nurses who knew her, she 
was repeatedly threatened by neighbors in her township of KwaMashu, 
outside Durban, who said she was giving their community a bad reputation. 
Last Monday, she was punched and slapped by a man who told her that 
many others who were sick kept quiet about it. South Africa has the 
world's fastest-growing AIDS epidemic, according the the latest Unaids 
reports, and KwaZulu-Natal, where Ms. Dlamini lived, is the worst-hit 
province. Up to 30 percent of adults there are infected. Although 
Ms. Dlamini called the police that day, they did nothing, friends 
told a local newspaper. That night, a mob attacked her house and stoned 
her, kicked her and beat her with sticks. She died the next day. ``She 
was a nice, bright woman, and now her child is an orphan because of 
AIDS,'' said Mercy Makhalemele, a Durban-area administrator for the 
association. ``But not because she died of it. Because she was trying 
to exercise her constitutional right to freedom of speech.'' Prudence 
Mabele, the first black South African woman to admit being HIV-positive, 
said she was threatened many times after coming forward in 1994. She 
moved out of her township into downtown Pretoria largely out of fear, 
she said. A gay San Francisco group wrote letters to her local police 
station then, and it seemed to help. ``But I just don't know if people 
should come out now,'' she said Sunday. Kevin Osborn, a former local 
leader of the association, said he thought the killing would ``put 
the cause of people with AIDS two steps back.'' Ms. Makhalemele said 
she was not sure, thinking it might galvanize anger in the small activist 
community. They have an uphill task. The head of the association, 
Peter Busse, said last month that fewer than 100 of the country's 
3 million infected people were completely open about it. ``When something 
like World AIDS Day comes around, we have trouble finding 20 people 
to go on television and radio shows,'' he said. Ms. Dlamini's death 
is not going to galvanize much right now. U.S.-style activism about 
AIDS does not exist in South Africa, and all the association's chapters 
are closed for Christmas-summer vacation. ``I'm waiting for Jan. 4. 
to make a big hoo-hah about this,'' Ms. Mabele said. Ms. Makhalemele 
said she hoped to have a protest march in Ms. Dlamini's memory organized 
by late March. A spokesman for the KwaZulu-Natal health department 
called the attack ``sheer stupidity'' and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, 
who promoted AIDS awareness in his Christmas message to the nation, 
said: ``It is a terrible story. We have to treat people who have HIV 
with care and support, and not as if they have an illness that is 
evil.''
