What's rated as the world's toughest canoe race is under way in Australia. 
Over 1,000 competitors, in all sorts of crafts, have set off in the 
Murray river marathon. The six-day trek takes canoeists 250 miles 
down the mighty Murray. The unseasonably strong cold and strong head 
winds already are making the going tough. The race is rasing money 
for the red cross and will end on new year's eve.
