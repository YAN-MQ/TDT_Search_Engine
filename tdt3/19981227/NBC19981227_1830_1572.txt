Finally this evening, the battle of the bulge now being waged at kitchen 
tables and health spas all over the country. NBC's Mike Boettcher 
reports from the front line. America's annual year-end feast, it starts 
on Thanksgiving. Heaping helpings, plenty of fat and lots of sugar 
all wreaking havoc on the waistline. And it all leads to new year's 
resolutions about getting rid of the evidence. All the way up and 
down. But this year, a new trend, a plan not to leave any evidence 
in the first place -- exercising during, and not just after, the holidays. 
go! go! go! It's called working out and finding a way to make it fun. 
At Barry's boot camp in west Hollywood, the rules are clear. Show 
up on time, five days a week or else. If they're late, it's push-UPS. 
If someone else is missing, like today we were missing somebody, so 
the whole class had to do push-UPS in their honor. Statistics show 
that the average person will gain between five and ten pounds during 
the holidays. But many Americans are hitting the gyms early, determined 
to exercise more than just a little will power. At crunch gym in Los 
Angeles, Diane Holland is burning holiday calories exercising to the 
beat of live musicians. I know this class is here, so I can eat an 
extra piece of Turkey or an extra piece of Pie 'cause I'll just come 
to the class and it'll be gone. Have a drink, have eggnog, why not? 
But make sure you get up the next morning and work out. In addition 
to working out, Robert Williams finds that the key to winning the 
holiday battle of the bulge is moderation. What I do is have scheduled 
cheat days, like on this day I can have a Brownie, but I'm moderate 
throughout the rest of the week and try to keep up a consistent exercise. 
In Miami, they're moving fitness classes out of the gyms and onto 
the beaches. The key to this class is that you can't simulate this 
inside the gym. And doing everything on the sand really helps you 
to work every single muscle in your legs, every single muscle in your 
arms because of the sports-specific activities that we're doing. And 
in New York, they are combining workouts with cyberspace. Now exercisers 
can surf the web, and check E-mail while they Tone. Treating excess 
with exercise, a holiday compromise that keeps the spirit of the season 
while keeping off the pounds. Mike Boettcher, NBC news, Los Angeles.
