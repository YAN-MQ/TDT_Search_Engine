One game remaining. One playoff spot up for grabs. I'm Matt Yallof, 
with "CNN Headline Sports." Arizona can nail down the NFC's final 
wild card berth today with a win at home against San Diego. Jake Plummer, 
8 years old the last time the Cardinals made it to the postseason, 
will try to lead Arizona to the promised land for the first time since 
1982. When you come to a place like this, it takes a lot of extra 
hard work. And then when you get it, it's just that much sweeter, 
because the valley hasn't it here, and I want to bring it, and I want 
to get it here for the valley. I've been here three years, and I think 
that, you know, what I've told our team and everybody in town is I 
don't really care what the past has been, or I'm only interested in 
today and tomorrow. Now, an Arizona loss opens up a few other possibilities. 
The giants remain alive with a win in Philly. Tampa bay, in Cincinnati, 
still in the picture if the Cardinals fall.
