Two main leaders of the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime who are defecting 
to the government stayed under wraps Sunday in a former stronghold 
of their once-feared guerrilla army. Keut Kan, a deputy governor of 
Pailin, confirmed that Khieu Samphan, the official leader of the bloodstained 
revolutionaries, and political chief Nuon Chea were staying at ``guesthouses.'' 
They were to travel to the capital, Phnom Penh, to meet Prime Minister 
Hun Sen on Tuesday, Keut Kan said. An official in Hun Sen's Cabinet, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed a helicopter would fetch 
the pair and dismissed speculation of last-minute snags over their 
reported fears of being sent abroad to face an international tribunal. 
Though Pailin is technically under government control, its leaders 
are all former high-ranking Khmer Rouge. Pailin's top leaders were 
in the capital at a wedding, Keut Kan said. There were rumors they 
were in fact negotiating guarantees for the newest defectors that 
they would only face trial in Cambodian courts _ if at all _ and then 
be pardoned. ``I met them on Dec. 25 at a border point,'' Keut Kan 
said. ``I was told to go there to wait for guests. They came in a 
car with their wives and their children.'' The rendezvous indicated 
the pair had been in Thailand, which has close contacts with the Khmer 
Rouge. Thai officials repeated standing denials over the weekend of 
hosting Khmer Rouge leaders. In New York, the group Human Rights Watch 
issued a statement urging that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea be tried 
and convicted before any talk of pardoning them. Hun Sen said Saturday 
that the defection was sealed in a telephone call Christmas night 
_ 20 years after Vietnam invaded to topple the Khmer Rouge government. 
Keut Kan said that he did not have authority to let journalists meet 
the defectors but said their health was fine. Khieu Samphan ``looked 
happy when I met him, but I think he might be a little worried whether 
he can live in peace or not,'' Keut Kan said. Pailin is controlled 
by Ieng Sary, once brother-in-law and right-hand man of Pol Pot, leader 
of the regime that caused the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians 
after the group seized power in 1975. Ieng Sary was the first leader 
to defect to the government in 1996, receiving amnesty in return. 
He led thousands of guerrillas out of a stalemated civil war, the 
beginning of the end of the movement. The defections leave at large 
only one major figure, the one-legged general Ta Mok, at the head 
of an estimated 100 die-hard loyalists. They pose no threat to the 
government. King Norodom Sihanouk, who is receiving medical treatment 
in Beijing, has approved the defections. The monarch was held prisoner 
in his palace under the Khmer Rouge and lost a dozen family members. 
Sihanouk expressed ``deep gratitude about this good news,'' echoing 
conciliatory language used by Hun Sen that indicated the pair had 
surrendered in exchange for guarantees they would not be harmed. The 
government and the United States have said in the past that they wanted 
Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok tried by Cambodian courts or an 
international tribunal for crimes against humanity. Pol Pot _ purged 
in a bloody power struggle last year _ died of a purported heart attack 
in April. Legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited Cambodia 
last month to assess evidence for a possible international tribunal. 
The report should reach Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a few weeks. 
Om Yentieng, a Hun Sen aide, said the prime minister supports a trial, 
but only in woefully unequipped local courts. Granting de facto amnesty 
to Khmer Rouge leaders has brought peace to nearly all of Cambodia 
for the first time in a generation, but at the price of holding none 
of the guerrillas accountable for their crimes.
