Sri Lanka's best known woman athlete, Susantika Jayasinghe, says she 
wants to leave her homeland and train abroad because of what she says 
is harassment by local officials. ``I have reached the dead end. I 
can't bear it any more,'' Jayasinghe, 23, told The Associated Press 
on Sunday. She said she hasn't decided where she would go. ``I have 
decided to go abroad. More than training, it is to get away from these 
officials who are harassing me, and get into a better frame of mind,'' 
she said. The world's 200-meter silver medalist, Jayasinghe is this 
Indian Ocean island country's most controversial athlete. She made 
headlines earlier this month after she pulled out of the Asian Games 
in Bangkok pleading injury. She has twice tested positive for performance 
enhancing drugs. But, she says, that is because she has often taken 
medication to control her menstrual cycle which can leave traces of 
organic compounds found in Nandralone-19, a performance enhancing 
drug. A ban on her was lifted after medical evidence proved her correct. 
After she returned from Bangkok, the Island newspaper in Colombo quoted 
her as saying that she was being harassed by local sports officials 
and couldn't concentrate on her training. Jayasinghe has not named 
any officials, but in the past she has accused sports ministry officials 
of harassment, including sexual advances which she says she resisted. 
She has also said that powerful politicians were plotting to kill 
her husband. Her accusations reached parliament in this conservative 
island country, with deputies and ministers making wild statements, 
charges and counter-charges. Jayasinghe, who practiced running barefoot 
among rubber trees in central Sri Lanka, won a silver medal in the 
women's 200 meter sprint at the World Track Championship in Athens 
in August last year. She became only the second Sri Lankan athlete 
to win a medal at a top international meet in 49 years. Duncan White 
won a silver in the 400 meter hurdles at the 1948 Olympics. ``I am 
from a poor family, my father is a laborer in a rubber estate. My 
request is please let me run and please don't bother me.''
