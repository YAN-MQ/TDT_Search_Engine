The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in thin, end-of-year trading 
early Monday. Japanese stocks advanced moderately. The dollar bought 
116.35 yen in early trading, up 0.22 yen from late Friday in Tokyo. 
Financial markets in New York and London were closed Friday for the 
Christmas holiday. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 
64.37 points, or 0.47 points, to 13,862.32 points in the first 30 
minutes of trading. On Friday, the average closed up 91.22 points, 
or 0.67 percent. In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's movement 
was limited in Tokyo as many overseas markets remain closed for the 
year end holiday period or open with reduced staff. On the stock market, 
share prices opened higher on buying of blue chips amid the yen's 
weakening against the dollar. A weaker yen makes Japanese exports 
less costly in the United States and U.S. goods more expensive in 
Japan. Trading, however, remained extremely thin as many participants 
were staying out of the market at the end of the year. ``There aren't 
many participants today, and a notable lack of foreign activity,'' 
said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo 
Securities. The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed 
on the first section was up 4.73 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,087.69. 
The TOPIX closed up 8.78 points, or 0.82 percent, on Friday. The yield 
on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond stood at 
1.750 percent, unchanged from Friday's finish. Its price remained 
at 100.40 yen.
