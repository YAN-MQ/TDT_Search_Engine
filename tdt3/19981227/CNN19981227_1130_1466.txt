Actors Julia Roberts and Robin Williams are both making a splash on 
the silver screen this holiday season. Anna Hovind takes a look in 
this edition of "now showing." Kids keep on hating me. Oh, come on, 
don't say that. They don't hate you. waa! Anna, what do you think? 
Well, it kind of smells like you, and I'm allergic to you, too. Julia 
Roberts is the "stepmom." She always feels she's in competition with 
her boyfriend's ex-wife, Susan sarandon. Mommy? What, sweetie? If 
you want me to hate her, I will. "stepmom" is directed by Chris Columbus, 
and is rated "pg-13." If you want to become a doctor, we have to learn 
to treat the patient as well as the disease. That's why we have to 
dive into people. Robin Williams is "patch Adams," a medical student 
who tries to prove that laughter is the best medicine. His methods 
aren't exactly a hit with his supervisors. Patients don't need a friend. 
They need a doctor. My name is Dr. -- Phil. I'll be your surgeon. 
Oh, there you are. The film is based on a true story. You treat a 
disease. You win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you'll 
win, no matter what the outcome. "patch Adams" is rated "pg-13."
