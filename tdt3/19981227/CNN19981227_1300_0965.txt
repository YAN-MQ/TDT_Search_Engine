December represents as much as a quarter of the ski season. And if 
there's a shortage of snow in December, ski operators could see a 
Shortage of cash for the season. Howard Nielsen has the story. Ski 
areas generate 20% to 30% of their Gross revenues during the seven 
to ten days of December. If they don't get business then, they're 
in trouble. It really puts them in a position of playing catchup all 
season long. And quite frankly, if they don't get that, it's really, 
really difficult to catch up. This year, unseasonably warm weather 
before the holidays brought little snow. 30 years ago, the lack of 
any significant natural snow leading into the holiday season would 
have had ski area operators tearing their hair. But that's not the 
case today. The difference is snowmaking. Ski area operators are more 
concerned that they get cold temperatures than they are that they 
get natural snow. As the technology improves, they can adjust snowmaking 
to humidity and warmer temperatures. The industry wouldn't be where 
it is without snowmaking. Snowmaking is everything to the industry. 
The challenge is to convince skiers in metropolitan areas how good 
man-made snow really is. If there is no sign of natural snow in the 
city, skiers don't get excited. Things have been a little slow and 
scarce. Not having snow here in the local area does definitely hurt 
us. The reputation of man-made snow is improving, and some skiers 
are willing to take a chance. We're hoping that there's more snow 
up there. We know they're making snow like crazy. The fortunes of 
the ski country innkeeper are closely tied to snow. One or two rooms 
missing in an important period of time can affect me drastically. 
Larger ski corporations are in better shape. If the skiing is bad 
in one section of the country, it can be balanced by good skiing elsewhere. 
Call it spreading the risk on the slopes. Howard Nielsen, newry, Maine, 
for "CNN Financial News."
