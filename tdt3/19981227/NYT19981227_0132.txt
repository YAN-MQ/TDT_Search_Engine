Honoria Murphy Donnelly, the daughter of Gerald and Sara Murphy, the 
golden couple at the center of the modernist whirl in 1920s Europe, 
who was dandled on the knees of the towering figures of the avant-garde, 
died on Tuesday at the Hospice of Palm Beach in Palm Beach, Fla. She 
was 81 and lived in Palm Beach Shores and East Hampton, N.Y. The cause 
was liver cancer, said Amanda Vaill, the author of ``Everybody Was 
So Young: Gerald and Sara Murphy _ A Lost Generation Love Story'' 
(Houghton Mifflin). Mrs. Donnelly, the eldest of the Murphys' three 
children and the only one to reach adulthood, published a biography 
of her parents, ``Sara &AMP; Gerald: Villa America and After'' (Times 
Books) written with Richard N. Billings, in 1982. Attractive, cultured 
and well-to-do (Gerald was heir to the Mark Cross leather-goods fortune, 
Sara the daughter of an industrialist and a grandniece of Gen. William 
Tecumseh Sherman), the Murphys epitomized the urbane insouciance of 
the jazz age. Although Gerald enjoyed a brief career as a painter 
_ his small output remains well regarded _ he and his wife were content 
to occupy backstage roles as bartenders, muses and sometime financial 
angels to the foremost writers, composers and artists of their age. 
In return, the Murphys were memorialized (not always graciously) in 
the work they supported. They were the inspiration for Dick and Nicole 
Diver in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel ``Tender is the Night''; Sara 
was the model for Picasso's ``Woman in White,'' and Fitzgerald bestowed 
the name Honoria on the heroine of his 1931 story ``Babylon Revisited.'' 
Honoria Adeline Murphy (she pronounced the `H' in her first name) 
was born in New York on Dec. 19, 1917. Fair-haired and blue-eyed, 
she ``looked like a Renoir and was dressed accordingly,'' in the words 
of the Murphy biographer Calvin Tomkins. In 1921, partly to escape 
the philistinism of American culture, the Murphys sailed for Europe 
with Honoria and her younger brothers, Baoth and Patrick. In Paris 
they painted scenery for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, which gave them 
entree to a circle that included Picasso and Jean Cocteau. In the 
summer of 1925 the family moved to Antibes, on the Riviera, then an 
unheard-of destination in warm weather. (The Murphys are credited 
with starting the Riviera's summer season.) They christened their 
house Villa America. At Villa America, they moved in a shimmering 
bubble that seemed to insulate them from ordinary cares. The late 
'20s passed there in a charmed blur of jazz and champagne and beaded 
dresses, of spats and white flannels and sherry and biscuits on the 
seashore. A representative guest list: Picasso, Fitzgerald, John Dos 
Passos, Archibald MacLeish, Philip Barry, Robert Benchley, Dorothy 
Parker, Cole Porter, Monty Woolley, Igor Stravinsky, Fernand Leger, 
and Ernest Hemingway and his consecutive wives. To Honoria and her 
brothers, these artistic titans were simply the adored tall people 
of their enchanted childhood. Hemingway taught her to catch and gut 
fish. (She got off easy: He once tried to teach her father to fight 
bulls.) The photographs in the family album were by Man Ray. Scrutinizing 
one of Honoria's drawings hung on the Villa America terrace (nicknamed 
``Les Salons de Jeunesse''), Picasso counseled, ``Don't change it.'' 
As a young woman, she studied French theater history with Mrs. Darius 
Milhaud and acting with Mrs. Patrick Campbell. She later performed 
with the French Theater of New York and worked as a secretary for 
Theater Inc., a producing organization. In recent years, she lectured 
on the Lost Generation writers and opened her vast archive of family 
memorabilia to scholars of the period. In 1929 the real world intruded 
savagely on the Murphys' idyll when their youngest son, Patrick, was 
found to have tuberculosis. They returned to the United States, where 
Honoria attended Rosemary Hall School in Greenwich, Conn., and the 
Spence School in New York, from which she graduated in 1937. It was 
Baoth who died first, in 1935, after contracting spinal meningitis 
at 15. ``Only the invented part of our life _ the unreal part _ has 
had any scheme, any beauty,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Fitzgerald. ``Life 
itself has stepped in now and blundered, scarred and destroyed.'' 
Two years later Patrick died at 16. Fitzgerald wrote to the Murphys: 
``For a long, long time you will be inconsolable. But I can see another 
generation growing up around Honoria and an eventual peace somewhere.'' 
A devoted daughter who was ever conscious of her responsibility as 
the sole surviving child, Honoria fulfilled that prophecy. After an 
early marriage that ended in divorce, she married William M. Donnelly, 
a businessman, in 1950. (On their honeymoon, she telephoned her parents 
every night.) The couple lived in Carmel, Calif., and later in McLean, 
Va. Mrs. Donnelly, who was widowed in 1988, is survived by their children, 
John of Palm Beach Shores, Sherman of Key Biscayne, Fla., and Laura, 
of East Hampton, N.Y., and three grandchildren. ``How different a 
dawn than the one we saw in a hospital 18 years ago,'' Gerald Murphy 
wrote to Sara after the Donnellys' second son was born. ``Two boys 
went out from our family, and now two other boys have come into it.''
