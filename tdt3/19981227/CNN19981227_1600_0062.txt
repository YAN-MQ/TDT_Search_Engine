After a week of intensive medical attention, the smallest of the chukwu 
octuplets has died. The baby girl, nicknamed odera, was the smallest 
of the eight, weighing just 10.3 ounces at birth. The other seven 
babies remain in the Texas children's hospital in critical condition. 
Odera's mother, bedridden since the births, was able to visit all 
eight babies, including odera, for the first time last night. The 
parents say they are very saddened by the baby's passing, and that 
she is now -- "safe with God in heaven," and they remain "most grateful 
to him for having blessed our lives with hers."
