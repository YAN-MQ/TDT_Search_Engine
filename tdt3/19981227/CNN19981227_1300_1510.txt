Audiences in India appear to be responding to traditional Broadway 
entertainment. Anita Pratap looks at a musical that is finding a match 
between different cultures. It's an Indian rendition of the hit Broadway 
musical "fiddler on the roof," the story about the life and fortunes 
of a Jewish community living in a poor Russian village. Considering 
I haven't seen a Broadway play, I think this is something I really 
enjoy. I'm not looking at it like a rehash of a play. It's just an 
interesting thing to see. To Indian audiences, it doesn't matter the 
story is set in Russia and the treatment American. Oh, I think it's 
great. It's fantastic. The whole thing's been done fantastically. 
They're coming out very live. They're very vibrant. Costumes may be 
different, the dance steps unfamiliar, but the story is universal, 
and therein lies its appeal. "Fiddler on the roof" is a very, very 
appealing musical to all kinds of indians, also, because they face 
the same situations of daughters and tradition and getting them married. 
It's a major problem in India. And I think it's very relevant to our 
times. Matchmaker, matchmaker make me a match find me a find catch 
me a catch Indian mothers can identify with the anxieties of a Russian 
mother searching for a suitable bridegroom -- A poor girl with no 
dowry can't be so particular. You want man hair, marry a monkey. -- 
just as many can identify with these young lovers' desperation. "Fiddler 
on the roof" has enjoyed a successful run in new Delhi. So have other 
amateur Indian productions of Broadway musicals like "evita," "Tommy" 
and the "west side story." The audience for English plays is limited 
in India, but organizers say it is growing, especially among students 
in urban areas, who are becoming more westernized. Anita Pratap, CNN,
