Many residents across the southern U.S. are getting their electricity 
and heat back today. A prechristmas ice storm knocked down power lines 
across the region. The storm left thousands without power in North 
Carolina, Virginia, mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas and 
Tennessee. Parts of Virginia may not get service back until the middle 
of the week. Meantime, freezing rain from the storm is making driving 
difficult, and stranding many holiday travelers. The icy conditions 
caused heavy traffic on highways and delayed hundreds of flights.
