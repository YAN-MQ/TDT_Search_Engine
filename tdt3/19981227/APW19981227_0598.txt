Tribesman on Sunday prevented workers from repairing a damaged oil 
pipeline that they blew up two days earlier in northeastern Yemen, 
tribal leaders said. Armed men asked a group of technicians working 
for the American Hunt Oil Co. not to repair the pipeline in the Marib 
province, 170 kilometers (107 miles) northeast of the capital, San`a, 
said the tribal leaders, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
They said the tribesmen did not use force. Tribesmen, who have been 
demanding that the government give them a percentage of the oil profits, 
also blocked laborers from heading to work in other oil fields in 
the Marib province. The official Al-Ayam newspaper reported Sunday 
that tribesmen blew up the Hunt oil pipeline Friday and tribal leaders 
said fire was still raging Sunday. Hunt officials could not be immediately 
reached to give an assessment of the damage. A similar explosion in 
the past resulted in a loss of 1,500 barrels of oil a day. Friday's 
blast was the latest attack on oil and gas pipelines since June when 
tribesmen and city residents protested a 40 percent rise in the price 
gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas to meet demands by the International 
Monetary Fund. Tribesmen are also demanding that the government build 
power plants and a water distribution system in their region. Large 
parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not hesitate 
to use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express discontent 
with the government. Hunt Oil Company's oil field concession in Marib 
produces 165,000 barrels per day. The company employs 1,300 Yemeni 
staff in addition to 30 foreign workers.
