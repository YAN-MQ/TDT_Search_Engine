A recent diplomatic trip by the Chinese vice president suggests he 
is being groomed to be his nation's next leader. Rebecca MacKinnon 
reports. Who is Hu jintao? China's vice president represented his 
country in Vietnam recently at the annual meeting of the association 
of southeast Asian nations, his first foray into diplomacy. This, 
you could say, is his debut trip, and his, you know, the beginning 
of him taking a higher profile in his new role. Newly appointed in 
March, vice President Hu is seen as president jiang Zemin's annointed 
successor. Jiang is expected to retire in the year 2002. At which 
time he might become the next Deng Xiaoping -- Deng gave up all his 
official titles in the early '90s, letting jiang run the country. 
But until his death in 1997, it was Deng who had the final say on 
policy. Now, analysts believe Jiang wants the same arrangement with 
Hu. Hu jintao has at least three or four years to prove himself, to 
prove to the nation that he is equal to the task. An engineer and 
career bureaucrat, the 56-year-old Hu came onto the national stage 
in 1992 after a four-year stint running Tibet. Since then, he has 
been in charge of communist party ideology and personnel. To prove 
himself as China's future leader, he will need more experience in 
foreign affairs and economic policy. Being an anointed successor isn't 
easy. Deng Xiaoping had two others before Jiang. One of them is still 
under house arrest for his role in the 1989 student protests. Observers 
say Hu jintao's challenge is to prove he can lead without having too 
many original ideas. Rebecca MacKinnon, CNN, Beijing.
