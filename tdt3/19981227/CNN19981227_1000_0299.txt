Another team of adventurers is getting ready to try and circle the 
globe nonstop in a balloon. A crew of Australians and Americans will 
try to lift off from the australian outback on Tuesday morning local 
time, depending on the weather. They hope to succeed by flying on 
the edge of the atmosphere where weather shouldn't be a factor. Friday,

end their attempt by ditching in the pacific ocean near Hawaii.
