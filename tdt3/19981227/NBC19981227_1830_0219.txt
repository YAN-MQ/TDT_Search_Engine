To Washington now, and preparations to put the president on trial. 
The one thing republican and democratic senators agreed on today was 
the need to handle this matter with all deliberate speed. NBC's John 
Palmer is at the White House tonight. With the beginning of his Senate 
impeachment trial that could remove him from office less than two 
weeks away, Mr. Clinton and his family attended church, greeted crowds 
outside a restaurant, and took in a play today, while leaders of both 
parties seemed to move closer to the idea of censuring the president. 
But only after the trial has begun and perhaps only after the two 
articles of impeachment have been voted on. I think a trial is inevitable. 
I believe that that is the way the Senate will begin to do its work. 
At anytime in that process, of course, we can adjourn and entertain 
a Censure motion. We'll have a trial. And there will be censure. And 
then, God willing, there will be closure. I think the Senate should 
dispose of those articles, both of them, then get to the matter of 
censure and what the president might say in connection with some kind 
of censure resolution. Several key republican senators insist that, 
as part of any censure deal, the president must admit to lying under 
oath. I think he has to admit it. Because everybody in the world knows 
he did lie under oath. And I think he's got to get rid of this phony 
set of legal parsing and hair-splitting. But those close to the president 
say he won't do that. He won't because he doesn't believe he lied 
under oath. I think that he has said that he misled. Former press 
secretary Mike McCurry, who left the White House in october and has 
since been critical of Mr. Clinton's conduct in the lewinsky matter, 
said today he has not been consulting with the president or his staff. 
I think I've been in the dog house with the White House. so be it. 
They've got good people working on it. They have to respect the wisdom 
of the Senate. I think the Senate will do the right thing. And to 
find a way to render punishment that is appropriate, short of removing 
our president from office. White House officials say the president 
would like to see a Bipartisan solution short of impeachment. At the 
same time, the president's lawyers are spending this holiday period 
at their desks preparing an aggressive defense. John Palmer, NBC news, 
at the White House.
