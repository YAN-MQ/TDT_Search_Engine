A baby born prematurely after his mother was knocked down during a 
guerrilla rocket attack on Israel has died, according to media reports 
Sunday. Keren Hevroni was knocked onto her stomach from the impact 
of a rocket landing near her apartment, during last Wednesday's attack 
on the northern town of Kiryat Shemona. She was carrying twins. One 
fetus died immediately. The other was born late Thursday night, and 
placed on life support. He died Saturday. ``The baby who survived 
for two days, I visited in intensive care,'' Hevroni told Israel Television. 
``I visited him twice, I stood by him and looked at him, and I just 
prayed that at least he would survive.'' One other Israeli was wounded 
in the attack and fifteen were treated for shock. The attack, carried 
out by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group, was in retaliation 
for an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday that killed a Lebanese woman and 
six of her seven children. Israel said the intended target had been 
a Hezbollah radio transmitter and that the building housing the family 
had been hit by mistake. The Israeli army blamed pilot error and expressed 
its regret at the deaths.
