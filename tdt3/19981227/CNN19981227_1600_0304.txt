Republicans and democrats in the Senate appear to agree that a presidential 
impeachment trial may be unavoidable. However, democrats want to bring 
it to a quick end. At least one republican says the Senate should 
vote on the articles of impeachment before any alternative is debated. 
Minority leader Tom Daschle says a decision on censure could come 
soon after the trial begins. I think this is too grave. We take our 
responsibilities too seriously to divert away, to try to find a Way 
to look at other issues. We've gotta concentrate on this. We've got 
to resolve it. We've got to come to closure on it. The best way to 
do that is to concentrate entirely on this issue until it is resolved. 
This is not a complicated case. It need not take long. I have said, 
and it remains my view, that we ought to vote on these articles of 
impeachment, and then, that is the appropriate time to consider a 
censure. All of that could be dealt with in a rather compressed way, 
because this is not a complicated case, and I don't view us having 
a lengthy trial here. The Senate will take up the impeachment matter 
after it convenes again on january 6th.
