A disagreement between the governments of Hong Kong and Beijing is 
now out in the open. The issue -- capitol punishment policy. Details 
from NBC's Ned Colt. He was best known as "big spender," one of Hong 
Kong's biggest crime bosses. For years Cheung tze keung defied police, 
kidnapping two of Hong Kong's richest men, then lavishly spending 
the ransom money. His arrest was good news for law enforcement, but 
his trial rekindled a Controversial political debate. Because he was 
arrested in China, mainlands say, they could deal with him on the 
basis that they have jurisdiction over the offenses that he committed 
in Hong Kong. As well as the offenses he committed in the mainland. 
The crimes committed in the mainland were arms smuggling, death penalty 
offenses there. Cheung was quickly convicted and less than 90 minutes 
after his appeal was rejected, a firing squad executed "big spender." 
Some in Hong Kong say the case illustrates the flaws of the "one country/two 
systems" arrangement between the former British colony and the communist 
mainland. Maybe you can do acts in Hong Kong which are not criminal, 
but they could be considered crimes in the mainland. One has the death 
penalty, the other does not. Some criticize the Hong Kong government 
for doing nothing to save Cheung and two other gang members executed 
by China. We feel the Hong Kong government simply has no courage, 
has no the determination to defend the rule of law, to defend the 
high degree of autonomy. The government says it was a matter of jurisdiction, 
not autonomy. We do not think it is realistic for our government to 
take on the role of monitoring or interfering with the judicial proceedings 
of the mainland. But those who back a hands-off approach to Hong Kong 
by Beijing say the "big spender" case underscores how fragile Hong 
Kong's independence is, and how leaders here are unwilling to question 
policy decisions from the mainland. Ned Colt, NBC news, Hong Kong.
