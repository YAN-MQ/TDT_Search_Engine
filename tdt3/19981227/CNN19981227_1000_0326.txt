The Iraqi vice president says his country will fire on any allied 
warplanes that enter the no-fly zones set up by the United Nations. 
The announcements came hours after British airmen saw Iraqi anti-aircraft 
fire, while they were patrolling airspace over southern Iraq. The 
pilots did not view the anti-aircraft fire as dangerous, because it 
was far away from where they were flying. U.S. officials say they 
will not be deterred by Iraq's threat, and will continue to patrol 
the no-fly zones. The airspace that the American and British planes 
are monitoring is above the 36th parallel and below the 33rd parallel. 
The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in 1991 
to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north, and Shiite 
Muslim rebels in the south.
