The number of murders committed annually in big cities is down. Pierre 
Thomas reports the drop could reflect a national trend. Homicide in 
the city. Police tape. Blood on the street. But now there are fewer 
of these scenes around the country. Even Washington, D.C., once known 
as the nation's murder capital, is seeing a decrease in homicides. 
The fact that we've had a decline, the fact that we are at a ten-year 
low, is, in my opinion, signs that we are making some serious progress. 
This year, the number of D.C. murders stands slightly above 250. That's 
15% lower than 1997. New York City is expecting to see an 18% drop 
in homicides. In fact, compared to 1990, this year's roughly 600 killings 
in the big apple represent a stunning two-thirds drop from 2,200 eight 
years ago. In Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, another 
huge decline. There, 385 murders -- 28% fewer than last year. In fact, 
a CNN survey of the murder rate in 25 of the nation's largest cities 
shows at least 15 on pace to have decreases in homicides. Because 
these cities are so large, law enforcement officials predict the nation 
will also see a similar drop in the murder rate for this year. If 
the numbers hold, it would Mark the seventh year in a row of sliding 
homicide rates. What's at play here? There are a lot of theories. 
People talk about the improved economy. People talk about the aging 
of the baby boom generation. That is crime-committing individuals 
in that range. Law enforcement experts also point to high rates of 
incarceration, fewer Turf wars over crack cocaine markets and more 
aggressive policing that targets high-crime areas. But while there's 
been progress, America remains a violent nation. In many neighborhoods, 
we still have a parent who can't send their child to the store at 
7:00 at night to buy a quart of milk without fearing for that child's 
safety. Even with the decline, between 1992 and 1997, there were more 
than 120,000 murders in the U.S. Pierre Thomas, CNN, Washington.
