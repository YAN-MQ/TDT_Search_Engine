Today is the second day of the African-American holiday of kwanzaa. 
Rusty Dornin reports, unlike Christmas or hanukkah, kwanzaa is neither 
a Religious nor an ancient holiday. Inspired by the civil rights struggles 
of the '60s -- The most disastrous and the worst riot -- -- conceived 
by a southern California black activist shortly after the Watts riots 
in '65. A holiday unique to African-Americans. I created kwanzaa in 
the midst of the black liberation movement. Kwanzaa, a nonreligious 
holiday beginning on the day after christmas and ending on new year's 
day. Seven days, seven candles standing for the principles of unity, 
self-determination, collective work, cooperative economics, purpose, 
creativity and faith. Based around symbols of African harvest festivals. 
Kwanzaa is a celebration of family, community and culture based on 
the first fruit celebrations of African culture. Kwanzaa traditions 
have become a business for some. And while it involves exchanging 
presents, that's not meant to be the focus of the holiday. Some might 
say, "well, we've lost the battle on Christmas in terms of commercialization, 
but let's try to, you know, let's try to do something with kwanzaa 
that sort of brings the family together for something other than receiving 
presents." Kids in Oakland, California, are learning to make, rather 
than buy, gifts for kwanzaa. Nobantu annkoanda has been practicing 
the secular holiday since the late '60s. She wants her kids to practice 
the values all year long. Collective work, responsibility -- "have 
you helped and clean up your room and clean up the household all year 
without fussing and fighting? Did you volunteer?" "Why, sure I did." 
"Give me an example when." So we do a lot of that in my family to 
try and get them to really live those principles throughout the year 
and not just look at it as something that you do at the end of the 
year. Kwanzaa's creator claims millions practice the holiday, even 
in countries outside the U.S. his hope is that the holiday will continue 
to grow, passing on to future generations. Rusty Dornin, CNN, Oakland, 
California.
