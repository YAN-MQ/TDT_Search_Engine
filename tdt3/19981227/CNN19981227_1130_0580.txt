Vicious rainstorms are pounding parts of Britain and Ireland. Police 
say one man was killed in western Ireland when a tree fell on his 
car. Two others in Britain are feared dead. 50 flood warnings have 
been issued across western Britain due to heavy rainfall. And in Ireland, 
as many as 100,000 homes are without electricity after 100-mile-an-hour 
winds knocked down trees and power lines. Crews are working to restore 
service.
