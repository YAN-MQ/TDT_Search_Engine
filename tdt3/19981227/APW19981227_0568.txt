The successor to East Germany's communist party intends next year 
to introduce a bill in parliament to grant amnesty to former East 
German officials, the party leader said Sunday. Lothar Bisky, chairman 
of the Party for Democratic Socialism, said he would like to see an 
end to investigations against former East German lawyers, politicians 
and army members, and a lifting or reduction of sentences for those 
already convicted. He accused prosecutors of seeking to make up for 
the lax treatment given to many ex-Nazis after World War II by pursuing 
East German functionaries. ``That this now is to be made right by 
of all things the clearing up of East Germany history, I consider 
it to be an exercise on the wrong object,'' he said in an interview 
with The Associated Press. A PDS lawmaker, Evelyn Kenzler, was harshly 
criticized earlier this month by Germany's main governing and opposition 
parties after she called for an amnesty for former East German officials 
convicted of crimes under communist rule. Some called the idea an 
insult to former East German activists whose peaceful demonstrations 
led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. All mainstream parties 
have voiced opposition to an amnesty, making the PDS proposal unlikely 
to go anywhere in parliament. But Bisky said he felt those who worked 
for the East German government and did not violate East German laws 
should be left in peace. ``That doesn't mean that one doesn't deal 
with the effects (of their actions) critically,'' he said. The PDS 
has long argued against trying officials and the rank-and-file for 
enforcing what was then East German law, including the shoot-to-kill 
orders on the border. The federal Constitutional Court, Germany's 
highest, ruled in 1996 that the trials were legal because the shootings 
violated human rights.
