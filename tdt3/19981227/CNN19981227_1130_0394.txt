Police in suburban Houston, Texas, are keeping a close eye on motorists 
this holiday season. But what they're looking for might surprise you. 
Dan Garcia of affiliate khou has the story. Police in Angleton are 
watching holiday traffic this year just as they have every year in 
the past. But along with looking for traffic violators, they're looking 
for something else this year. They're looking for people who are driving 
safely. And if they see you being a good driver, you might be pulled 
over when you come to Angleton. Angleton's new police chief, David 
Ashburn, started the effort to reward good drivers for two reasons. 
He says it's helping build a bridge of goodwill between officers in 
the community, and this time of the year, it's also helping with something 
else. And I guess it's also a way to make people think a little more 
about safety. Well, we like to see people, you know, just generally 
being courteous drivers, observing the traffic laws, you know, using 
their signals when they change lanes. Utilizing their safety belts. 
So throughout his entire shift this holiday season, officer richard 
DeLeon and all of Angleton's finest are looking for people upholding 
the state's traffic laws. The reason we stopped you today is we're 
participating in what we call the safe driver reward program. And 
instead of getting a ticket, these safe drivers are getting a Coupon 
from one of several local restaurants for something free to eat. For 
most drivers, their initial reaction is the same. I was just surprised 
to see the lights on me. Has it been working? Well, one motorist we 
talked with said she'd read about the program in the local newspaper 
the same day it started. Since then, she'd been driving extra safely 
just in case she got stopped.
