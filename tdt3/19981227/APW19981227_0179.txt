An appeals court has upheld the conviction of a Kuwaiti woman sentenced 
to 10 years in jail for beating her Asian maid to death with a tennis 
racket, the Arab Times reported Sunday. In June, a criminal court 
found the woman guilty of causing severe injuries that led to the 
death of her helper, the English-language daily said. The Kuwaiti 
woman was identified only by her first name, Manar. The victim was 
Fatima Sethi, the paper said. It did not give her nationality. The 
woman's husband and brother testified that she severely beat the maid 
in October 1997 to punish her for not doing the housework properly, 
the paper said. She can make a final appeal to the Cassation Court. 
Complaints of physical abuse and non-payment of wages are common among 
domestic helpers in this oil-rich Gulf state. Maids, many of them 
from Asia and the Indian subcontinent, earn about 35 dinars (dlrs 
115) a month.
