All eight of the chukwu octuplets remain in critical condition at 
a Houston hospital, but doctors are especially concerned about the 
smallest one. Odera is on minute-to-minute care to fight infection 
and to control her blood pressure. Four of the babies remain on ventilators. 
One had a respiratory problem yesterday. Another had intestinal surgery. 
Their mother is eating well and gaining strength. She's in stable 
condition and is expected to be released from the hospital shortly.
