Keeping in touch is getting easier for business travelers. Revolutionary 
advances in technology are helping to shrink the once bulky satellite 
phone. Steve young reports. They used to come in a suitcase. But now 
iridium is crowing it's shrunk the satellite phone. It can be yours 
for only $3,000. Add another $2 to $6 a minute for talk time. But 
thanks to a first of its kind network of 66 low-flying satellites, 
that's from practically anywhere to anywhere. Our focal customer is 
someone who travels globally, travels internationally, these are both 
business travelers as well as people in vertical markets like oil 
and gas exploration, mining, Mineral extraction. The more remote the 
place, the better they work. Patrolling an oil pipeline? No problem. 
On an oil tanker at sea? A piece of cake. Not bad, either, in Boulder, 
Colorado. And surprisingly okay, too, on a midtown Manhattan street. 
But oddly, not on the roof. And almost never inside a building. That's 
what much cheaper cell phones are for. Iridium's window of opportunity 
to charge $6 a minute is not unlimited. Three other companies promise 
competition. Globalstar, starting next year. And later, ico, based 
in London. And ellipso, a private company. Iridium represents a $5 
billion investment. The company went public at $20 in June, 1997, 
and now trades at just over $40. A little more than half the 30% U.S. 
stake is owned by Motorola. A consortium of companies from other nations 
own the rest. We have a projection of 23.6 million subscribers to 
satellite telephone systems by 2006. That represents 1.8% of all cellular 
subscribers. A very small penetration to justify this. But even if 
you have the $3,000 to spend on one, not that many have been made 
yet. Steve young, financial news, New York.
