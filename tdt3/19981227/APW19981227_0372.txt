More people are becoming dissatisfied with the performance of the 
Hong Kong government, a semi-annual public opinion poll showed Sunday. 
The survey, conducted by the University of Hong Kong between July 
and December, showed 36.9 percent of 4,755 people questioned said 
they were dissatisfied with government's overall performance, compared 
with 15.4 percent in the same period in 1997. Only 22.7 percent of 
respondents said they were satisfied, down from 42.7 percent from 
last year. The poll also said 55 percent of those questioned expressed 
dissatisfaction with the government's economic performance, up from 
16.8 percent. Hong Kong's economy, which is mired in recession, contracted 
7 percent in the third quarter. It is expected to shrink by 5 percent 
this year, compared with 5.3 percent growth in 1997. No margin of 
error was given for the poll.
