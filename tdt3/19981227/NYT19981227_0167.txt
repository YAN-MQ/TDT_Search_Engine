In what could lead to the cancellation of the National Basketball 
Association season, Commissioner David Stern on Sunday presented what 
he called the league's final offer to the executive director of the 
players union, Billy Hunter, and league officials said Hunter turned 
it down. League officials said that the union's response to Stern's 
list of concessions left them with no hope of saving the NBA season 
before Jan. 7, the deadline Stern set last week. ``We're done; we 
have gone as far as we can go,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin, the NBA's chief 
legal officer. ``There are no more offers. I expect the season to 
be canceled.'' Hunter, who met with Stern for five hours in Denver, 
was not available for comment on the meeting. In an attempt to make 
progress toward ending the nearly six-month old lockout, Hunter, who 
was on his way to New York from Oakland, Calif., stopped over to meet 
with Stern, Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik and special assistant 
Bob Lanier in a session that left both sides still far apart. Hunter 
was joined by union president Patrick Ewing and the union's chief 
legal officer, Jeffrey Kessler. ``In an attempt to salvage the season, 
we made additional improvements in our offer in the following areas: 
increases in the high-end limitations, the rookie salary scale, the 
percentage of revenues to be shared with players, and the minimum 
salary,'' Stern said in a statement. ``We also proposed an additional 
exception to the salary cap and accepted the union's 10 percent limitation 
on the escrow arrangement. Unfortunately, this was not enough for 
the union. We advised the union that no further offers from the NBA 
will be made.'' If so, the union's apparent rejection of the league's 
offer puts the NBA that much closer to becoming the first major professional 
sport to cancel a season. But with time remaining to make a deal, 
Hunter may be planning to present the league's latest offer to the 
union's negotiating committee in the next few days and then contact 
Stern again during the week. But one union official said, ``Most of 
the changes on the part of the league were purely cosmetic.'' Before 
Sunday's meeting, Hunter had been willing to swap concessions and 
accept the maximum salary offers by the league if Stern would reciprocate 
by increasing the minimum salary and offer an additional salary-cap 
exception. The concessions offered by Stern did address the union's 
major concerns, but the numbers apparently fell short of the union's 
desires. In presenting its new proposal, the NBA moved on several 
points. On limiting the salaries of high-end players, the league offered 
the following: Players with six years or less years in the league 
could earn $8.75 million in the first year of a deal; players with 
seven to nine years, $10.5 million, and players with 10 or more years, 
$12.25 million. In the past, the union has discussed a $15 million 
maximum for players with more than six years in the league. In addressing 
minimum salaries, the league agreed to offer minimums of $275,000 
to first-year players, $300,000 to second-year players, $350,000 to 
third-year players, and then add $50,000 additionally each year, leaving 
a minimum for a nine-year veteran of $650,000. In the 10th year, a 
veteran would receive $1 million as a minimum. The union has been 
seeking $375,000 for rookies, $500,000 in years 2-5, with $100,000 
increases after six years and a $1 million limit. On one critical 
issue, the league increased its offer on the players' share of total 
revenue to 53 percent in the fourth year of the deal, 53.5 percent 
in the fifth year and 54 percent in the sixth. The union, throughout 
negotiations, has held firm on getting 56 to 57 percent of basketball-related 
revenues.
