Talks were planned early in the week to resolve a two-day-old strike 
at the Arc de Triomphe that barred throngs of holiday visitors from 
climbing atop the stone monument, officials said Sunday. Culture Ministry 
officials were to meet as early as Monday with the Union of Cultural 
Affairs Personnel, which was demanding the government hire more attendants. 
About 60 employees work at the Arc de Triomphe, and union officials 
say that with rising numbers of visitors in the past year, the staff 
is overworked. Employees have also complained that conditions were 
more difficult than at other Paris cultural sites, due to the noise 
and pollution from the traffic circle surrounding the monument and 
the cramped spaces inside the Arc. The ministry was looking for a 
quick solution to the dispute, said a ministry spokesman on condition 
of anonymity. Built at the top of the Avenue des Champs-Elysees between 
1806 and 1836 to honor Napoleon's victories, the Arc de Triomphe draws 
about 1.4 million visitors a year. Winding stairways lead up to the 
roof, with a view of the Paris skyline. Strikes in recent weeks have 
also hit the Orsay, Louvre and Grand Palais museums, with employees 
making similar demands for more staff to handle larger crowds. A recent 
strike at the Eiffel Tower, operated by the city of Paris, was staged 
by workers demanding more hirings to comply with the leftist government's 
35-hour work week law.
