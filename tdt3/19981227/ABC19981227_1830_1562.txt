We have proof tonight that true love is not seasonal. Not when it 
involves a big, tough football player and his favorite cheerleader. 
And especially not when that cheerleader is the football player's 
mom. ABC's Lisa Salters tells us that perhaps both of them belong 
in the hall of fame. He fires down the field. got it! For football 
fans, daunte culpepper may not be a usehold name just T. BU thihoe'thly 
name that counts. I just love to see him play. 83-year-old Emma culpepper 
is Dante's mom. Back in 1977, she was working in a halfway house for 
troubled teens. She was 62 years old and ready to retire when a teenaged 
mother begged her to adopt her newborn son. When she first asked me, 
I said, "uh-huh, Barbara, I can't take no children." But Emma had 
already raised 14 other children, none her own. She decided one more 
couldn't hurt. I hadn't had no trouble with all the other ones I had. 
And I figured I could just do it for him. And so far, he turn out 
to be one of the best. Shotgun for daunte. One of the best college 
quarterbacks in the country. In addition to his Cannon arm, culpepper 
is known for something that most quarterbacks are not, his speed. 
He can run a 40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds. I'm sitting in here watching 
the television. I see this quarterback. I see him drop back. I see 
him throw. I see him Sprint out. I see him roll around. And I say, 
"wow, this guy has really got something." According to daunte, that 
something is the inspiration he gets from his mom. When I'm on the 
field, she's always in my heart. And in the stands at every game. 
I be hollering, "run, Danny, run. Get off my damn boy. You better 
not hurt him." Daunte culpepper chose not to play for a football powerhouse 
like florida or Florida state. And he decided not to quit school to 
earn millions in the NFL. Instead, he wanted to stay close to home, 
at the University of central florida, keeping a promise he made to 
his mom. I know she wanted to see me in school and finish what I started. 
I say, "if you go to school and get something in your head, they can't 
take that away from you. Get you a degree." Say cheese. So next may, 
daunte culpepper will become the family's first college graduate. 
All, he says, because of a kind and generous woman named Emma. Without 
her, I don't think I'd be the person I am today. Lisa Salters, ABC 
News, Orlando.
