A natural gas pipeline exploded Sunday in a rural hamlet in northern 
Colombia killing at least nine people and injuring dozens more, authorities 
said Authorities had not determined the cause of the blast. The early-morning 
explosion in Arroyo de Piedra, 410 miles (680 kilometers) north of 
Bogota, also destroyed twenty houses, said local fire chief, Sgt. 
Gonzalo Charris. ``Apparently there are more victims in the wreckage 
of the homes,'' Charris said in a radio interview. The exact death 
and injury toll, as well as the ages and sex of the victims, was unclear. 
Charris reported 15 deaths and 50 people injured. However, the health 
secretary in the nearby town of Sabana Larga, Rafael Bohorquez, said 
in a separate radio interview that 10 people had died and 58 were 
injured. A photographer present in the area told The Associated Press 
he had seen the bodies of nine blast victims. Police said the gas 
was turned off immediately after the blast, and the fire was under 
control.
