The subject is bananas. But it's no joking matter. A trade dispute 
over bananas between the U.S. and Europe may soon prove to be costly 
to producers and consumers on both sides of the atlantic. Producers 
and consumers of many more products than just bananas. Here's ABC's 
Mike Von Fremd. Dole and Chiquita, two American food giants, operate 
banana plantations in Latin America that are the envy of world producers. 
But the world is on the brink of a trade war. In an effort to protect 
their own growers, European governments are slapping quotas and high 
tariffs on American companies trying to sell bananas in Europe. This 
is pure protectionism, pure discrimination, plain and simple. The 
world trade organization agrees and has ruled the tariffs are illegal. 
At this White House meeting ten days ago, the president demanded that 
european leaders stop discriminating against American bananas. When 
they refused, the president retaliated. By January 21st, the U.S. 
will slap 100% tariffs on such European goods from food to apparel, 
including Louis viton handbags and mont blanc pens. Such measures 
will threaten companies and jobs right across Europe's economy. American 
consumers will also feel a pinch. Shoppers today were surprised to 
learn he price T $325 handbag is about to double. Seems the U.S. is 
going through drastic measures just for bananas. And it's gonna hurt 
-- if it hurts us, that's not, obviously, that's not a Good policy. 
Complicating the issue, Carl lindner, the chairman of Chiquita, has 
made significant campaign contributions to both parties. He was the 
target of this protest that looked a bit like a food fight after he 
spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom at the invitation of president 
clinton.tement chiita says -- political contributions did not in any 
way influence the initiation of the United States against the European 
banana policy. Because the bananas are grown in Latin American, this 
fight has more to do with protecting American pride than protecting 
American jobs. Nevertheless, President Clinton promises to make Europe 
pay a price for thumbing its nose at American bananas. Mike Von Fremd, 
ABC News, the White House.
