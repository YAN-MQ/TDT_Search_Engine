Good evening. She lived just a week. The smallest of the octuplets 
born last Sunday in Houston died early this morning. She weighed less 
than a pound and fit in the palm of a hand. Her seven brothers and 
sisters are in critical condition. We begin with ABC's Steve Osunsami. 
Doctors at Texas children's hospital worked frantically to revive 
odera's heart. But early this morning, shortly after 3:00, the smallest 
of the world's only living set of octuplets was pronounced dead. Her 
physicians say she weighed 10.3 ounces at birth and was the least 
likely to survive. In a statement, the hospital said today that "attempts 
to re-establish normal heart rates with medication and chest compressions 
were unsuccessful." The Nigerian-born parents, nkem visited their 
children last night for the first time, just as odera's condition 
began to deteriorate. Today they thanked the hospital staff who "worked 
tirelessly to help odera in her battle for life against what turned 
out to be overwhelming obstacles." Dr. Martha Caprio-Lagos, a neonatal 
specialist, says the prospects for odera's brothers and sisters are 
uncertain. They're still in grave danger. They're at risk for infection, 
many times a baby like this can get an infection and die. As the seven 
remaining brothers and sisters enter their second week of life, the 
struggle to survive continues. The youngest child, gorom, left surgery 
yesterday where doctors corrected a Perforation in her abdomen. The 
first of the two boys, ikem, suffered through respiratory trouble 
on friday and was put on a ventilator. And even the first born, sbuka, 
who came into the world 12 days earlier than her siblings, still needs 
help breathing. The three other sisters and one brother weighed the 
most at birth, between 24 ounces and 26 ounces. Unlike their siblings, 
these four are in critical but stable condition, and are breathing 
on their own. Steve Osunsami, ABC News, Atlanta.
