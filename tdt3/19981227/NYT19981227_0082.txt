Politics has made the spectacle of human behavior very distasteful 
in recent days, and though none of it should be ignored, some of it 
must be put at a distance for at least some of the time. So I have 
sought escape in the world of animal fables and animation, gazing 
at old MGM and Warner Brothers cartoons on cable television, following 
nightly episodes of ``The Simpsons,'' watching ``Babe'' on video and 
then going to the theater to see the sequel, ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' 
where I sat across the aisle from a small boy who cried ``Ouch! Ouch!'' 
every time something painful or frightening happened. There is no 
pain that can't be turned to pleasure in those old cartoons where 
pigs, rabbits, ducks, crows and foxes have at one another with no 
pretense of motive beyond natural law, cheerful spite and the love 
of trickery. Writing about Walt Disney in 1934, the art critic Erwin 
Panofsky said that cartoons had all the elements of folklore _ ``sadism, 
pornography, the humor engendered by both, and moral justice'' _ which 
they turned into variations on the David and Goliath theme, ``the 
triumph of the seemingly weak over the seemingly strong.'' Quite cathartic 
in their way, and exactly the principles at work in full-length animation 
spectacles like ``Antz'' and ``A Bug's Life.'' Things often get kinder, 
gentler and duller when humans enter the picture. But one of the pleasures 
of ``The Simpsons,'' and clearly one of the reasons the show gets 
away with its blithe-spirit satire of American life, is the fact that 
the family members look as though someone combined the physical traits 
of several species, primate and otherwise, to make them. Cartoons 
wouldn't exist without caricature and expressionism, but those qualities 
are usually matched by the extreme situations the characters trip, 
stumble, swagger and fall into. That's not true here. We are in the 
land of ``It's a Wonderful Life''; but there is no angel to intervene, 
and nothing has turned out the way Frank Capra planned. Where else 
in television sitcoms post Archie Bunker and Roseanne will you find 
such jaunty acknowledgment of greed, sloth, earnest ineptitude and 
cheerful selfishness among family and friends in the workplace, the 
schools and the home? Along with good intentions, reconciliations 
and (for a little while at least) cheerful endings. Why not? Life 
can supply these, too, and comedy demands them. When ``The Simpsons'' 
was first broadcast in 1989, it was fun to say that the smartest, 
cheekiest sitcom on television was a cartoon. Now it's pretty depressing. 
In short-range terms, I'd love to see what the show would do with 
the forthcoming Senate impeachment trial. Long range, I'd like to 
see what would happen if a television show that starred actual rather 
than animated human beings risked doing what ``The Simpsons'' already 
does. I'm almost embarrassed to say how much I liked the ``Babe'' 
movies, with their fusion of real people, real animals, animatronic 
animal doubles and animation. And I'm appalled that ``Babe: Pig in 
the City'' is a failure at the box office in part because adults seem 
to think it is too dark for their children. Is it any darker than 
``Bambi'' or ``Dumbo''? If adults don't want to go with children, 
then they ought to go themselves. I did. ``The Simpsons'' invites 
grown-ups to talk about satire; ``Babe'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City'' 
are fables that make us talk about sentiment and morality. When Paramount 
first made cartoons based on ``Aesop's Fables'' in the 1920s, five 
animals arranged themselves around a logo that read ``sugar-coated 
pills of wisdom.'' But for all their pills of wisdom, their declarations 
about the virtues of an unprejudiced heart, of courage and loyalty, 
their praise of how a pig _ that most low-caste of animals _ sought 
identity, community and love in the world of animals and humans, the 
``Babe'' movies tap real emotion, not just sentiment. They are filled 
with stories about power, pride and prejudice, both inter- and intra-species. 
The city that Babe must travel to in order to help save his beloved 
Farmer Hoggett's land is a place of shysters, lowlife entertainers, 
thugs and beggars. And that's just the animals. The humans are even 
more threatening and considerably more shallow, especially those who 
fail to acknowledge that they are bound to animals by respect as well 
as by need or greed. (Is there a political fable tucked in here somewhere? 
Yes, as a matter of fact. Both movies are anti-colonialist, more subtly 
but just as surely as Orwell's ``Animal Farm'' is anti-totalitarian.) 
I haven't read the Dick King-Smith book that inspired ``Babe,'' but 
I can say that as movies the ``Babes'' have a leisurely expansiveness 
and a way of framing episodes that comes from novels. You will think 
of E.B. White; of both ``Charlotte's Web'' and ``Stuart Little.'' 
But you will think of Dickens, too, in some of the darker city scenes, 
where cruelty, innocence and caricature push up against one another 
with real violence. Of course, children, along with dissenting or 
disenfranchised adults, love animal fables. When you cannot make yourself 
understood by people with power over you, you might as well belong 
to another species. Their laws and pronouncements make little or no 
sense to you, but unless you can outwit them, you must obey. Can you 
blame the boy across the aisle from me for screaming ``Ouch!''?
