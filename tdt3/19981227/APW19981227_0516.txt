Two men were killed and a third was missing and feared dead in high 
winds and rain in Britain and Ireland, police said Sunday. Michael 
Joyce, 26, was killed in the Irish Republic when a falling tree crushed 
his car near the village of Maam Cross, in the Connemara region of 
County Galway. His girlfriend escaped unhurt. In Brighton, southern 
England, coastguard officials called off the search for a 28-year-old 
man was swept into the sea by a 30 foot (9 meter) wave as he walked 
along a beach with his girlfriend and her son. A rescue attempt later 
failed. The coastguards said it was unlikely the man would survive 
in the cold water. In Devonshire, southern England, search teams found 
the body of 44-year-old Paul Witt, who was swept away while watching 
flood waters at his home in the village of Ashburton. He was last 
seen standing close to a broken fence at the bottom of his garden 
and is thought to have accidentally stumbled into the River Ashton. 
Searchers found a body just half a mile downstream on Sunday and police 
identified it as Witt's.
