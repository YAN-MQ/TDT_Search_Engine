Syl Apps, the Hall of Fame center of the Toronto Maple Leafs when 
they dominated the National Hockey League in the 1940s and one of 
Canada's finest all-around athletes of his era, died Dec. 24 at his 
home in Kingston, Ontario. He was 83. In his 10 years in the NHL, 
Apps had 201 goals and 231 assists and was renowned for his gentlemanly 
play. ``Apps is the cleanest player I've ever known,'' said his coach, 
Hap Day. ``He never bends an elbow except to twist his stick over 
an opponent's wrist. The strongest language he ever uses is `by hum' 
and `jiminy Christmas.' '' Conn Smythe, the Leafs' general manager, 
would introduce him at gatherings as ``Syl Apps, our captain, who 
does not smoke or drink.'' Apps once flattened a Boston Bruin defenseman 
who had knocked out two of his teeth with his stick, but he proved 
that players did not have to fight in order to win. In the 1941-42 
season, when he won the Lady Byng Trophy for sportsmanship and did 
not incur a single penalty, he was a first-team all-star and a runner-up 
for the Hart Trophy as most valuable player. And he led the Maple 
Leafs to their first Stanley Cup championship in 10 seasons. Charles 
Joseph Sylvanus Apps, a native of Paris, Ontario, also excelled in 
football and track and field. He was captain of the football team 
at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, graduating in 1936, and 
was the British Empire pole-vault champion in 1934 and the sixth-place 
finisher in that event in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Apps won 
the first Calder Trophy, as the NHL's top rookie, in the 1936-37 season. 
An agile skater although a 6-foot 210-pounder, he led the league in 
assists, with 29, in each of his first two seasons. After serving 
in the Canadian Army in World War II, Apps led the Maple Leafs to 
Stanley Cups in 1947 and 1948, then retired. He finished with a flourish, 
passing the 200-goal mark in his final regular-season game, against 
the Detroit Red Wings, when he scored three goals, a hat trick. Apps 
was a five-time all-star with 432 career points but only 56 penalty 
minutes, and he was perhaps fortunate that in his later years he played 
on a line with Wild Bill Ezinicki, a legendary tough guy. Apps was 
given a misconduct penalty, in a game against Montreal in February 
1947, for leaving the bench to enter a fight. But that penalty was 
expunged by the NHL president, Clarence Campbell, who ruled that ``Apps 
did not leave the bench until after the play was stopped and took 
no part in the altercation.'' In an era when Maple Leaf Gardens was 
a citadel of hockey, Apps served as the captain on Toronto teams that 
also had stars like centers Ted Kennedy and Max Bentley and goalie 
Turk Broda. Apps was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961. He 
ran unsuccessfully for the Canadian parliament in the spring of 1940 
when he sandwiched campaign speeches between hockey games. After retiring 
as a player, he served as Ontario's athletic commissioner, was a Conservative 
member of the Ontario Legislature from 1963 to 1974 and was minister 
of correctional services in the Ontario cabinet. His survivors include 
his wife, Mary; two sons, Syl Jr., who played in the NHL, with the 
Rangers, Penguins and Kings, and Robert Apps; and three daughters, 
Joanne, Carol and Janet. A grandson, Syl Apps 3rd, is a center for 
the Princeton University hockey team. Another grandson, Darren Barber, 
won a gold medal with the Canadian eight-oars rowing squad at the 
1992 Olympics.
