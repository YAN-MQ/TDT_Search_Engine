A time once returned for returns and exchanges is now a shopping season 
of its own. Valerie Hoff examines what after-Christmas mall madness 
means to retailers. Just when you thought it was safe to go back into 
the mall, crowds of shoppers hit stores across the country Saturday 
in search of postchristmas bargains. Retailers are trying to make 
up for a disappointing holiday season by offering shoppers deep discounts 
on all kinds of items, including shoes -- It's a wonderful deal. They 
were originally 40 bucks. I got 50% off plus an extra 10% off, so 
this is great. And it wasn't just the shopaholics making a go of it. 
The steep markdowns brought out even the more reluctant shoppers. 
Ah, trying to get the deals on the shopping. Normally I don't come 
out here, but heard "50% off." It kind of helps when you're shopping 
for 30 people. My significant other has a big family. Merchants no 
longer look at the days following Christmas as just a time for returns 
or exchanges. They count on a burst of postholiday buying to raise 
the bottom line. It draws people to the mall, people have to make 
exchanges, they see stuff they like, it ends up being turned over 
into new sales. The sales are great. Three bags full, still going. 
This is our first stop. We just went to the store, and I thought my 
Bill was going to be big, and I just got 30% off. Off a couple of 
items. I did great today. a sentiment most likely echoed by many shoppers.
