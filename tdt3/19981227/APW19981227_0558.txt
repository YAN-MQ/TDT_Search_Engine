An Iraqi weekly on Sunday named President Saddam Hussein Man of All 
Years because of his courage and popularity among the Iraqi people. 
``He alone... and nobody else lives in our hearts and symbolizes our 
dignity and pride,'' said Al-Musawir al-Arabi weekly in a front-page 
editorial. A picture of Saddam, wearing a cowboy hat and holding an 
AK-47 assault rifle, appeared next to the editorial. ``Who has the 
courage to keep the whole world busy?'' said the editorial, adding 
that Saddam enjoyed ``patience and forgiveness'' and ``does not fear 
but the creator.'' U.S. President Bill Clinton and independent counsel 
Kenneth Starr were named Time magazine's Men of the Year last week.
