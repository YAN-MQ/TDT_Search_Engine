A natural gas pipeline exploded Sunday in a rural hamlet in northern 
Colombia killing at least 12 people and injuring 58 others, authorities 
said Officials had not determined the cause of the morning blast, 
and they did not appear to be blaming leftist guerrillas who frequently 
sabotage oil pipelines. The deadly explosion occurred at 9:30 a.m. 
in Arroyo de Piedra, a village in Atlantico State roughly 400 miles 
(680 kilometers) north of Bogota. State health officials said nine 
people were killed immediately and three died later in nearby hospitals. 
Three of the dead and six of the wounded were children, they said. 
``The explosion was so large it sent rocks flying and brought down 
power and telephone lines. ... The nearby houses caught fire and their 
inhabitants have lost nearly everything, '' Rafael Bohorquez, health 
secretary in the nearby town of Sabana Larga, said in a radio interview. 
At least 50 homes were destroyed, Governor Rodolfo Espinosa told reporters 
during a visit to Arroyo de Piedra. Police said the gas was turned 
off immediately after the blast and the fire brought quickly under 
control.
