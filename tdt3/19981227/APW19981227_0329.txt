Unions, students and activists on Sunday were threatening street demonstrations 
and general strikes to protest a gasoline price hike imposed last 
week by Nigeria's military government. The Nigeria Labor Congress, 
the West African country's largest union group, warned a general strike 
would begin Jan. 4 unless the price increase was reversed. Lagos university 
students and the Joint Action Committee for Nigeria human rights group 
announced various public protests from Jan. 1 to 14. The official 
gasoline price rose more than 130 percent from 11 naira (13 cents) 
a liter to around 25 naira (29 cents). Prices for diesel and kerosene 
also went up as Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar's government deregulated 
petroleum products in an effort to cut recent chronic fuel shortages 
and to prevent blackmarket stockpiling.
