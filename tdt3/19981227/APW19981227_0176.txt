Iraq on Sunday submitted a draft resolution to a meeting of Arab legislators 
urging Arab nations to ignore U.N. sanctions on Iraq and demand that 
all foreign troops be pulled out of the Gulf. The resolution was put 
before the Arab Parliamentary Union by a delegation headed by Iraq's 
parliament speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, as about 200 members of Jordanian 
political parties and unions held a sit-in to demand an end to the 
sanctions. Outside Amman's Royal Theater where the lawmakers are meeting, 
the demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and waved banner saying 
any aggression on Iraq amounts to an attack on the entire Arab world. 
Four days of U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq that ended Dec. 19 brought 
demonstrations throughout the Arab world in support of Iraq, but until 
now all Arab governments have adhered to the trade sanctions imposed 
on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Eighteen out of the Parliamentary 
Union's 19 member states are due to send delegations to the meeting. 
Kuwait _ which has resisted all efforts to ease sanctions on Iraq 
_ has said it will not take part.
