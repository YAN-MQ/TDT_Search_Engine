Edwin Evariste Moise, distinguished professor of mathematics emeritus 
at Queens College and an author of textbooks, who helped decipher 
German and Japanese military signals in World War II, died Friday 
at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan. The cause 
was complications following heart surgery, his family said. Moise 
(pronounced mo-EEZ) specialized in topology, the mathematical study 
of those properties of geometric figures that remain unchanged under 
distortion, as with a Mobius strip. He wrote ``Introductory Problem 
Courses in Analysis and Topology'' (Springer, 1982), ``Elementary 
Geometry from an Advanced Standpoint'' (Addison Wesley, 3rd ed., 1990), 
``Number Systems of Elementary Math'' (Addison Wesley, 1966), ``Calculus, 
Part I'' (Addison Wesley, 1966) and other textbooks. Moise served 
on the faculty of Queens College from 1971 until 1987, and then devoted 
his time to studying 19th-century English poetry. Born in New Orleans, 
Moise graduated from Tulane University in 1940 and received his Ph.D. 
in mathematics from the University of Texas in 1947. During World 
War II, as a cryptanalyst in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, 
he decoded enemy communications. From 1947 to 1960, Moise taught at 
the University of Michigan, eventually becoming a professor. He was 
a professor of mathematics at Harvard University before arriving at 
Queens College. He was a temporary member of the Institute for Advanced 
Study in Princeton, N.J., (1949-51), and was also president of the 
Mathematical Association of America and vice president of the American 
Mathematical Society, as well as a fellow of the American Academy 
of Arts and Sciences. Moise is survived by Mary Leake Moise, whom 
he married in 1942; a daughter, Claire Moise of Manhattan; a son, 
Edwin, of Clemson, S.C.; and a grandson.
