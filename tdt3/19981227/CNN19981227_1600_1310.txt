With the college bowl season under way, everyone awaits the nation's 
first official bcs national championship game. Top-ranked Tennessee 
meets number two Florida state for all the marbles in the fiesta bowl 
January 4th. The volunteers are in search of their first national 
title since 1951, while the seminoles are trying to capture their 
second national title in school history, joining the '93 team. Vols 
coach Phil fulmer and his staff arriving on a chartered flight Sunday. 
The players arrived from all parts of the country after taking Christmas 
off. Tennessee has been ranked number one for six weeks, but some 
so-called "Experts" still favor fsu in this one. It should be a great 
football game. I think I would agree that it should be a defensive 
struggle, but in this kind of scenario, in this kind of game, when 
there's that much man-to-man played with the two defenses, there's 
opportunities for big plays every time you snap the ball.
