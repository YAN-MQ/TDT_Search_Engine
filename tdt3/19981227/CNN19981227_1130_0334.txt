One look at the nation's malls this weekend, and you might think nobody 
got what they wanted for Christmas. Not necessarily so. Analysts say 
retailers now do a sizable portion of their holiday business between 
Christmas and new year's -- up to 10% of their sales. While some shoppers 
are, no doubt, returning gifts this weekend, many others are coming 
in for the bargains. Some retailers have slashed prices by more than 
half to lure customers in, after a somewhat subdued holiday shopping 
season.
