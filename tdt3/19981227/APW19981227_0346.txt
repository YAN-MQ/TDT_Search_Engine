Rejecting the notion of peace talks and threatening to rain artillery 
shells down on Sierra Leone's capital, a rebel commander on Sunday 
said his troops would launch a major attack on Freetown anytime. ``When 
we start shelling the city we won't stop,'' said rebel commander Sam 
Bockarie. ``It's too late for talking and listening.'' Bockarie's 
Revolutionary United Front has staged a surprise series of assaults 
in recent days, reportedly moving the rebel force to within striking 
distance of the capital, Freetown. Fearing an impending attack, angry 
residents in Freetown surged through the streets over the weekend 
and burned alive at least two men accused of being rebel spies. Bockarie 
claimed his forces had killed at least 100 Nigerian troops _ members 
of a West African coalition force in Sierra Leone that ousted a military 
junta from power in February. Rebel fighters and their allies from 
the country's deposed military government have continued to wage war 
in Sierra Leone's countryside, carrying out of a campaign of terror. 
Although leaders of the rebel movement deny charges of mutilation 
and torture, human rights groups and aid workers say thousands of 
Sierra Leonean civilians have been butchered and maimed at the hands 
of the rebels. Gunmen from the Nigerian-led coalition force, known 
as ECOMOG, along with traditional militiamen, have been reinforcing 
the capital in anticipation of the looming attack by the RUF. Bockarie, 
known by his rebel nickname ``Mosquito,'' dismissed the defensive 
buildup. ``They are going to run away from us just as they have been 
doing so far,'' Bockarie said. The rebels say they are poised in the 
town of Waterloo, just 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Freetown. 
Varying reports also indicated fighting for control of the central 
town of Makeni, where both rebel and ECOMOG troops say they are in 
power. It was not immediately clear who was in control of Makeni, 
but the fact that the rebels were battling for that town and are on 
the outskirts of Freetown indicates a stunning reversal in recent 
months. Since driving the rebels and military junta from power more 
than 10 months ago, Nigerian commanders leading the ECOMOG force have 
repeatedly said the insurgent movement was on its last legs. Far from 
it, the rebels are now threatening to undo the successful first use 
of military force in Africa to restore a legitimately elected government. 
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was driven from power in May 1997 by 
then Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who established a military junta 
in conjunction with the Revolutionary United Front. The junta was 
ousted by ECOMOG in February, clearing the way for Kabbah's return 
in early March. Characterized by ECOMOG as small skirmishes by resistance 
fighters, fighting in Sierra Leone's hinterland has intensified in 
recent weeks and moved progressively closer to the capital. Refugees 
fleeing the fighting have flooded into Freetown.
