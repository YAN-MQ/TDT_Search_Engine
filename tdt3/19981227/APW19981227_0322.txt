The prematurely-born baby daughter of Albanian Premier Pandeli Majko 
was recovering from breathing problems at an Athens hospital, doctors 
said Sunday. The baby, born one month premature on Christmas Day, 
was brought by a Greek military plane to Athens Saturday at the request 
of Majko's family. The newborn was admitted to Elena maternity hospital, 
where the mother is also being kept for observation. Elena's doctors 
said the baby was responding well to treatment but that tests were 
still in progress. Hospitals in Albania, Europe's poorest country, 
lack many basic facilities.
