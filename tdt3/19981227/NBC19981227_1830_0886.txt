In "focus" this evening, putting into words the importance of words. 
Here's NBC's Bob Dotson. The old Warriors of the west have one last 
battle to fight and only a few who remember how. I'm the oldest Of 
the kiowa Indians. At 101, Parker McKenzie is still struggling to 
save their tribal language. I'm the only one left now -- Who remembers 
it all. That's the tepee I was born in 1897. Just before the kiowas 
got new neighbors. Settlers coming in in covered wagons, looking for 
wild kiowas. What do you think is the best thing that's happened in 
this century? When I got to be like an ordinary white man. But McKenzie 
is determined to help all of us understand the kiowa language. Right 
now, that's what that means. He designed a system of phonetics which 
translates kiowa into english. McKenzie started all this at a time 
when native American children could get their mouths washed out with 
soap for speaking their own language. Teachers wanted them to speak 
only English. Soon, the children could not understand the stories 
the elders told. With each passing generation, the kiowa's rich oral 
history was fading away. So, McKenzie began compiling a dictionary. 
The kiowas' first written language. How many words? 12,000. In his 
first book, 80 years ago. He's still adding more. Now it's about one 
word an hour. 492 new words just this year. But like Drums and feathers, 
the kiowa language seems a thing of the past. None of McKenzie's 19 
children and grandchildren speaks the kiowa language. After all your 
work, does that make you feel sad? Yeah. They don't care. But others 
do. McKenzie, a life-long clerk and typist, was awarded an honorary 
doctorate for his dictionaries. Because of him, the kiowas' words 
will be there for everyone, for all centuries. Bob Dotson, NBC news,
