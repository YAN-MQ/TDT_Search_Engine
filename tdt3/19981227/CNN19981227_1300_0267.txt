The Arab parliamentary union is condemning this month's U.S.-led airstrikes 
on Iraq. In an emergency session today, members called the four-day 
action "A dangerous policy which is against international law." The 
meeting was convened at the request of Jordan's parliament. In his 
keynote speech, Jordan's crown prince Hassan said the attacks worsened 
the suffering of Iraqi people. But he angered the Iraqi delegation 
by stopping short of any direct criticism of the United States or 
Britain. An Iraqi delegate said he wanted to hear more than words 
of pity.
