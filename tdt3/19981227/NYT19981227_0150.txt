In the southwestern corner of Texas, farther west than Santa Fe and 
farther south than Tijuana, lies El Paso, a raw-edged city built largely 
_ so it seems from the air _ of sheet-metal shoe boxes. The Rio Grande 
snakes through the desert from Las Cruces, past the stacks of Smeltertown, 
and there it becomes the border between the United States and Mexico, 
between the large-scale geometry of El Paso's industrial sector and 
the broken mosaic of Ciudad Juarez. On a clear winter day, a belt 
of brown smog tracks the boundary between Texas and Chihuahua. There 
are 49 states and then there is Texas, which, as Texans will tell 
you, is another country altogether. Texas has avoided one of the conflicts 
disturbing Western states like Utah and Idaho by containing virtually 
no federally owned land. And yet if you drive southeast from El Paso 
toward the Chinati Mountains, you realize that this region _ so empty 
of people _ is full of federal agents trying to control the flow of 
illegal aliens and illegal drugs across the border. This gives rise 
to more than one conundrum. The town of Marfa is home, for instance, 
to a sublime pastel courthouse and El Cheapo Liquor, to the Chinati 
Foundation _ a high-modernist museum erected on a former Army base 
by the sculptor Donald Judd _ and a small battalion of border-patrol 
officers. I drove across this trans-Pecos landscape in the near-dark 
recently. The wind fell stiff out of the north, with blowing snow. 
A large radar balloon, which normally flies at the end of a long leash 
to detect smugglers' low-flying aircraft, sat tethered beside the 
road under the orange glare of sodium lamps. Only the low shoulder 
of Chinati Peak was visible, and the horizon had been blotted out 
entirely. The border-patrol inspection station south of Marfa looked 
almost as welcome as an all-night truckstop with good biscuits and 
gravy. When morning came, Presidio County lay under snow, from Chinati 
Peak _ at nearly 8,000 feet _ right down into the desert canyons near 
the old silver-mining town of Shafter. People who do not know the 
desert tend to think of it as a nonseasonal, constant place. But it 
is constant only in its beauty. An earlier cold snap had brought autumn 
to the desert just as a sudden rain brings spring. Now the fall colors 
had faded from the ocotillo, and the bare, downswept boughs of ash 
trees looked like a summer cloudburst. The snow over the desert clarified 
both the colors and the forms of its plants _ Mormon tea, sotol, lechuguilla, 
leatherstem, acacias _ and the hard frost retained the tracks of javelina. 
There is something about seeing snow on an agave or a purple prickly-pear 
that reminds you what an intimate place the desert is, how subtle 
and specialized its effects are. Snow throws the vacancy of the desert 
into relief, and you see at once how little empty space there really 
is on the desert floor or its canyon walls. Emptiness seems like the 
prevailing conceit of this part of Texas, but after all it is only 
a misconception.
