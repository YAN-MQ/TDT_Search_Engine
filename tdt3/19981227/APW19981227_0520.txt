South African researchers will participate in an international AIDS 
vaccine development project that will focus on two African strains 
of HIV, a newspaper reported Sunday. The dlrs 9.1 million project 
is funded by the New York-based International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, 
the Sunday Independent reported. The South African government will 
contribute 5 million rand (dlrs 830,000) to the project, said Dr. 
William Makgoba, head of the country's Medical Research Council. The 
project will mark the first major efforts for a vaccine against two 
HIV strains found in South Africa and Kenya. Most vaccine research 
to date has focussed on an HIV strain found mainly in Europe and the 
United States, the newspaper said. About two-thirds of the 33 million 
people worldwide who are infected with the HIV virus live south of 
the Sahara, the United Nations said recently. Collaboration on the 
project will include AlphaVax, a U.S.-based company; the University 
of Cape Town; the University of Oxford in England and the University 
of Nairobi in Kenya, the report said. IAVI is an independent group 
founded in 1996 with backing from the Rockefeller and Sloan foundations, 
the United Nations and the World Bank. Its strategy is to develop 
multiple vaccines with partnerships between vaccine producers and 
developing countries. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
granted a California company permission to begin the largest test 
yet of a possible vaccine to prevent infection by the virus that causes 
AIDS. The three-year trial of VaxGen Inc.'s AIDSvax will include 5,000 
American volunteers at high risk for catching the AIDS virus and 2,500 
high-risk people in Thailand. Controversy has surrounded the development 
of an alleged AIDS remedy, Virodene, in South Africa. Earlier this 
month, the panel that controls drug testing rejected Virodene for 
clinical trials, saying the move was prompted by its concern for science 
and public safety.
