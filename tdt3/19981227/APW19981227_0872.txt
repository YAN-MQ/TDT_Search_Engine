Late in the year always has been the slaughter season at Belarusian 
fur farms, but the economic crisis in the former Soviet republics 
made this year a bit different. With sales of fur hats and coats down, 
the Voikov collective farm just outside the capital, Minsk, couldn't 
afford to feed its polar foxes and minks. So it has slaughtered most 
of them rather than watch them starve. The farm is trying to move 
the pelts at fire-sale prices, but the result is reduced breeding 
stocks. ``We had to do it, because the farm had huge debts to the 
meat plants that were supplying food for our fur animals,'' said Yuri 
Mikhailov, manager of the farm. ``We had to slaughter so many animals 
in order not to torture them any longer.'' The farm had 1,143 polar 
foxes and 845 minks, and killed all but 400 foxes that they will use 
to rebuild the stocks. On a recent day, the slaughtered animals were 
laid out in rows on the ground or piled high in the back of trucks 
at the rundown farm. Watchdogs barked fiercely to warn off visitors, 
but most of the cages they were protecting were empty. Young silver 
polar foxes, among the few that survived, bared their small, sharp 
teeth and also barked. The farm's foxes and minks long have fed the 
big demand for fur coats and hats in Russia, Belarus and other former 
Soviet states, where there has never been an active anti-fur movement 
as in some Western countries. Although expensive, fur is not only 
for the elite. Many middle-class Russians and Belarusians also own 
coats, and most consider them necessities in the harsh winter. ``Our 
people want to impress their neighbors, friends, relatives _ with 
crystal, furniture and furs, which some of them buy at the expense 
of eating properly,'' said Maxim Kapran, a member of Belarus' Youth 
Ecological Movement. Until recently, Russia purchased about 40 percent 
of the world's fur, but that figure is declining, say Russians in 
the fur industry. The economic crisis in Russia and Belarus has shrunk 
the pool of potential customers in both countries and may drive more 
fur farms out of business. Stores in Belarus have all but stopped 
carrying fur coats. Sales in Russia are down by half or more compared 
to last winter, and fur coats are piling up in storerooms, said Viktor 
Chipurnoi, vice president of Soyuzpushnina, Russia's fur trading company. 
``After the crisis the situation changed, of course, because people 
don't have money to pay for luxury items,'' Chipurnoi said. As a result, 
fur farming in both Russia and Belarus are in trouble. Only 30 of 
the 200 fur farms that Russia had in the early 1990s are still operating, 
Chipurnoi said. The others have closed, or are reducing their stock 
and gradually phasing out production. In Belarus, the conditions are 
as bad, if not worse. ``The problems the fur breeding industry is 
experiencing are common to the entire agricultural sector in Belarus,'' 
said Sergei Stranadkin, chairman of the Voikov collective farm, which 
includes the fur farm. In both Russia and Belarus, the best hope for 
an improvement in the fur business is an upswing in the overall economy. 
``We are trying to help fur farms,'' said Chipurnoi, the Russian fur 
trader. ``If the economy gets through the crisis, people will be buying 
fur again.'' ``Russia is a fur country,'' he added.
