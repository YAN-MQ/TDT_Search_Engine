A joint Australian-American attempt to fly a balloon non-stop around 
the world has been postponed due to high winds over the launch pad 
in Outback Australia. Team Re/Max, which planned to lift off from 
Alice Springs about 6 a.m. local time Tuesday (1900 GMT Monday), will 
hold off until a high pressure system causing strong winds over central 
Australia is expected to weaken on Thursday or Friday. The planned 
quest would come just days after Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett's 
team splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii on Christmas Day 
after completing about half of its attempt to circle the globe. Bill 
Echols, media spokesman for Team Re/Max, said ground and high altitude 
winds far exceeded safe launching conditions for the giant polyethylene 
balloon. ``The surface winds currently are too strong for any kind 
of a balloon launch at this moment,'' Echols said. ``Conditions are 
expected to continue until Wednesday; winds which will be too high 
for a safe launch,'' he said. The expedition is expected to take 16 
to 18 days and, if successful, would bring them back to Australia. 
The team is making its first attempt at what balloon enthusiasts describe 
as the last great adventure in aviation. Fossett, British millionaire 
Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden abandoned their more 
conventional balloon flight Friday about 10 miles (15 kilometers) 
off Kahuku Point at the northeast tip of the island of Oahu. They 
have tried a total of 11 times. Fossett's team ditched its balloon 
after losing the high-altitude 200 mph (320 kph) winds needed to carry 
the combination helium and hot-air balloon across the Pacific to North 
America. Echols, however, said Team Re/Max hoped to succeed where 
others had failed by taking the high road _ floating on the outer 
edge of the atmosphere where predictable weather, the bane of previous 
attempts, should not be a problem. The space gondola will carry pilots 
John Wallington of Canberra and Americans Dave Liniger and Bob Martin 
on a quest to set balloon records including duration, distance and 
altitude. Echols said the launch would be affected by both surface 
winds and winds at altitudes of up to 300 meters (990 feet) _ the 
height of the balloon. He said the good news was that winds in the 
stratosphere had increased by one knot per day over the last several 
days, making it possible for the adventurers to cut hours or even 
days off their expedition. ``That's really a positive for us if they 
can get up there and catch those faster winds,'' he said. ``It will 
mean that we cut that many hours or days off the total flight.'' Echols 
said the crew would be ready to launch on Thursday or Friday. ``That 
really affords us a little more time to make sure the gondola is properly 
re-installed and all the systems are working properly,'' he said.
