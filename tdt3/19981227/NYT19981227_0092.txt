When Heather Parisi fainted at the end of a dance number on a popular 
Italian variety show, it was reported on the front pages of Italy's 
leading newspapers. Wendy Windham, a blonde and buxom sidekick on 
yet another popular variety show, was mobbed by paparazzi as she went 
Christmas shopping in the Piazza Navona. Justine Mattera, who does 
a pale impersonation of Marilyn Monroe on a talk show, is a household 
name in Italy. So is Randi Ingerman, who recently got her own sitcom, 
``Men Are All Alike.'' Actually, in Italy it is the American women 
on television who have a lot in common. Like almost every other country 
in the world except perhaps Myanmar, Italy imports a large number 
of U.S. television shows, from sitcoms and soap operas, to ``E.R.'' 
But Italian television's fondness for Americana goes a bit further 
than most. Almost every variety show _ and there are dozens _ features 
what Italians call a ``soubrette,'' borrowing an old French term for 
a nubile maid in a theatrical comedy. On Italian television, the ideal 
soubrette does not necessarily sing or dance, but she is almost always 
tall, blonde and Californian, and speaks adorably fractured Italian. 
``They don't want me to speak Italian well,'' Ms. Windham said, explaining 
her job description on ``I Cervelloni,'' a popular variety show centered 
around inventors and their gadgets. The other requirements are that 
she wear sparkling gowns with slits and plunging decollete, and smile 
while the host, Giancarlo Magalli _ who is plump, balding and a full 
head shorter than she _ leers up at her figure and mocks the way she 
talks. American accents are funny to Italians. But Italian audiences 
also seem to delight in the pairing of tiny balding men with towering 
blonde women _ ``Regis and Kathy Lee'' as seen by Fellini. ``It's 
Beauty and the Beast _ the fantasy that even the monster can have 
the beauty,'' explained Gianluca Nicoletti, a radio talk show host 
and television critic. ``On Italian television, you never have handsome 
men, its short ugly guys and big, beautiful dumb women.'' But some 
sociologists also see deeper reasons rooted in the Italian fascination 
with American culture _ as well as tiny pangs of subconscious resentment. 
``We no longer look to the United States for economic help or political 
direction,'' said Franco Ferrarotti, a well-known Italian sociologist. 
``Now we are fixated on America for its youth. Europeans, and especially 
Italians, perceive themselves as old. And we are old _ 60 percent 
of us are retirement age. We have a new cultural ideal, which is a 
youthful, healthy looking American girl.'' Ferrarotti, whose own wife 
is American, added, ``She should be beautiful, blonde, and have an 
obvious handicap, like she can't speak the language. That allows us 
to be patronizing _ this perfect girl needs our help.'' Offstage, 
Ms. Windham, 31, a Californian who has lived in Italy for nine years, 
speaks fluent Italian and sometimes has difficulty recalling English 
(``How do you say in English, `furba?' '' she asked midsentence. It 
means clever.) On television, however, she is not supposed to seem 
furba. ``They don't want me to talk,'' she said. ``One time we had 
Australian inventors on the show and instead of letting me interpret, 
they used instantaneous translators.'' Ms. Windham shook her head 
forlornly. ``That made me mad.'' But she readily admitted that she 
has a career and celebrity in Italy that she could never hope to duplicate 
at home. So did Carol Alt, 38, a tall, blue-eyed former supermodel 
who has starred in several Italian mini-series and now, with the help 
of dubbing, plays a heart specialist on ``Under the African Sky,'' 
a new Italian television drama _ perhaps an exception to the dumb 
beauty rule. ``I'd like to work at home, for sure,'' Miss Alt said. 
``But I am very happy with what has happened for me here.'' Asked 
why she and other Americans were so popular in Italy, Miss Alt replied, 
``I think Italians find foreigners _ how do you say? _ affascinante, 
exciting and different.'' That may well explain the sudden popularity 
of Lisa Molten, a member of an international chorus of ``soubrettes'' 
on the game show ``The Wolf's Mouth.'' Audience members select the 
woman they want to spin the wheel, and Ms. Molton, 20, is picked so 
often that each time, the host, Carlo Conti, ritually sighs, ``Lisa 
again?'' Ms. Molton, 20, a ballet dancer from Easthampton, Mass., 
arrived in Italy only three months ago and was cast as soon as she 
opened her mouth and failed to say anything correctly except ``pasta.'' 
The balding and bespectacled host enjoys mocking her American accent, 
echoing the American-accented, Italian dubbed voice of Stan Laurel 
in the old Laurel and Hardy movies, which, known as ``Stanlio e Ollio'' 
are still popular in Italy. That inside joke is lost on Miss Molton. 
``They are always imitating the way I say ``non capito,''' she said. 
``I think it has something to do with two characters in Italian history.'' 
Ms. Parisi, 38, a dancer who has performed on Italian TV shows for 
20 years, was discovered in a Roman discotheque. Last month she riveted 
her fans when she fainted on ``Caramba, Che Fortune,'' while performing 
a vampy pas de deux. (She later explained a doctor had given her a 
overdose of painkiller for a strained leg muscle.) Italians love her 
dancing, but she is just as famous for her brash blonde American image 
_ and pronunciation. To some, this is a uniquely Italian phenomenon. 
``These shows reveal a mix of unconscious rascality and also self-mockery,'' 
explained Giuliano Ferrara, the editor of the Rome daily Il Foglio. 
``We really don't take ourselves seriously.'' Ferrara, who is married 
to a tall blonde Californian, added, ``it's a playful fantasy that 
even men like us can get get a tall, beautiful American girl.'' Why 
so many shows cater to male fantasies even though the audiences for 
them are predominately female, is a mystery that does not baffle Daniela 
Cannizzaro, the cultural critic for Italy's feminist magazine, Noi 
Donne. ``Women may dominate viewer audiences,'' Ms. Cannizzaro said 
wearily. ``But men still make the TV shows.''
