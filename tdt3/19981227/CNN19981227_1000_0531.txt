With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
The warmest readings will be found from Florida into south Texas and 
into the desert southwest on Sunday. The coldest readings from Hudson 
bay and across Canadian border states. As far as our weather features 
are concerned, going into Sunday, there is an approaching frontal 
system for Washington and Oregon. The winds will kick up, and the 
rain will come down. It could be heavy at times. Look for a bit of 
snowfall also over the Great Lakes and the upper mississippi river 
valley. For Alaska, Hawaii and the Caribbean, San Juan is expecting 
a high on sunday of 82, minus 18 for Fairbanks, and 80 in Honolulu. 
It is going to be messy on your way back to work on Monday across 
the eastern third of the U.S. from the gulf coast into the northeast 
and into New England. Then by Tuesday, temperaturewise, teens and 
20s once again along the canadian border states and the prairie provinces. 
Heavy rainfall is possible in the mid-atlantic. And then by Wednesday, 
look for 70s in southern California and the desert southwest. For
