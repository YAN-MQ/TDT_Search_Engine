Lasse Kjus, this season's World Cup downhill sensation, is suffering 
from bronchitis and will not start in the last speed race of the year 
scheduled in this Italian Alpine resort on Tuesday. Norwegian team 
officials said Sunday that Kjus will need about one week to recover 
and should be back to action in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, on Jan. 5-6. 
Kjetil Andre Aamodt, another leading Norwegian skier, also skipped 
Tuesday's downhill here _ the fourth of the season _ after missing 
a plane connection in Copenhagen and Sunday's opening practice, Italian 
organizers said. Austrian Fritz Strobl, in high spirit and form following 
his amazing third place in a Super-G at Innsbruck last Monday, led 
the first of two practice runs ahead of Italy's Peter Runggaldier 
and Swiss Bruno Kernen. Kjus, who trails World Cup leader Hermann 
Maier by only three points in the overall standings _ 537 to 540 _ 
dominated the two first downhills of the season in Val D'Isere and 
Val Gardena and placed second to Italy's Kristian Ghedina in the third. 
Kjus is the leader of the downhill standings with 280 points. He last 
started in Monday's Super-G at Patscherkofel in which he finished 
14th. His absence at the starting gate of the demanding and icy Stelvio 
course was expected to boost the Austrians bid for their first World 
Cup downhill victory this season. The other members of the Norwegian 
downhill team _ Lasse Pualsen, Kenneth Siversten and Audun Groenvold 
_ arrived too late for Sunday's run but will start in Monday's second 
practice and in the race. Strobl led Sunday's run down the 3,070-meter 
(10,070-foot) long course in one minute, 57.48 seconds, edging Runggaldier 
by 0.15. Kernen, the defending world downhill champion, came in third, 
0.28 behind. Werner Franz led Austrian teammates Andreas Schifferer 
and Maier for fourth place, Maier, who captured his first World Cup 
downhill career victory in Bormio last year, was one of the favored 
skiers in Tuesday's race. American Chad Fleischer placed seventh, 
0.60 seconds slower than Strobl. Ghedina was a distant 21st, with 
a gap of 1.61 seconds.
