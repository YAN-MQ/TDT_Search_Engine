Tonga faces food shortages and a massive cleanup after Cyclone Cora 
blasted through the Pacific Island nation, causing extensive wind 
and flood damage. None of the island's banana trees, which are a major 
food source and one of the country's principal export crops, were 
left standing on the affected Tongan islands, a Radio Tonga spokesman 
told New Zealand's National Radio on Sunday. ``I don't think any of 
the crops will be still standing,'' the spokesman said, adding surviving 
crops could die in the next few days from flooding seawater. The typhoon 
swept through on Saturday. There were no reports of injuries, the 
spokesman said. A seven-meter (23-foot) fishing boat with seven people 
on board, originally thought missing, had come into port when the 
storm threatened and was safe, police said. About 70,000 people on 
Tonga's main island of Tongatapu, about 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) 
northeast of Wellington, were without electricity or phone lines. 
Winds reached up to 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph) during the cyclone. 
``We've had extensive damages to crops, especially breadfruit, bananas 
and food crops, both in the northern islands and now the central island 
of Tongatapu,'' the spokesman said. Weather forecaster Chris Webster 
said winds on the island had dropped considerably and the cyclone 
was well to the southeast of Tonga. ``It's pretty much open ocean 
now around that area, but its still of considerable interest for shipping 
because anyone who's around there still obviously needs to know about 
it,'' Webster said.
