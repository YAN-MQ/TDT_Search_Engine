At least 200 TWA travelers were stranded overnight, attributed to 
a "Sickout" by trans world airlines flight attendants. The delays 
and cancellations began Thursday, when flight attendants unhappy with 
lack of progress in contract talks called in sick in large numbers. 
A judge had to issue a back-to-work order to get the attendants back 
on the job. TWA officials tell CNN they are "cautiously optimistic" 
that they can get everyone home today.
