Octuplets have died. She is smallest to fit in the palm of a hand. 
Her mother saw her for the first time last night. Today mourning and 
prayers for the surviving babies. Here's Rick Davis. At St. Albert 
church, it was a time to mourn the loss of one child and pray for 
the seven who survive. For the many members of the Nigerian community 
who worship here, word of the death of odera, whose name means "God 
has my life," came from father mark Schaffer. She rests safely and 
comfortably in the hands of God and her family, who are experiencing 
such a great loss in their family today. And from her parents today, 
words that contrasted so greatly with these smiles on Christmas day. 
Odera weighed 10.3 ounces at birth. Her brother, ikem, still needs 
a ventilator to breath. Gorom has undergone intestinal surgery. Ebuka 
is also aided by a ventilator. The other three girls and one boy are 
breathing on their own. But all are listed in critical condition. 
One child, ebuka, was born 15 weeks prematurely in St. Luke's hospital. 
Doctors were able to delay the other births by two weeks to give them 
a Better chance to develop. And upon their birth, these words from 
their father -- Glory be to God. Glory be to God." At the time of 
the birth, doctors said maintaining these lives would be a difficult 
struggle. These babies are critically ill. And we do have a lot of 
hurdles to get over. There's going to be some UPS and Downs in the 
first week or two, especially. They knew that odera was the most fragile. 
And today at the family's church words for what they have lost. It's 
not easy for them to go through that and lose their child. Every child 
is sacred. We feel bad for them. My heart goes out to them. And this 
congregation promised its continued prayers. Rick Davis, NBC news.
