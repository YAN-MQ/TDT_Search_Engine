There's supposed to be a truce in effect in the Serbian province of 
Kosovo, but today it looked more like all-out war. ABC's Richard Gizbert 
brings us up to date. All the ominous signs are there. Serb armor 
moving in. The dead, the wounded and the inevitable exodus of refugees. 
For two months the truce that Washington helped broker here had held. 
But today was the fourth straight day of fighting. A Serb offensive 
into banian-held territy not from Kosovo's capital, pristina. "They 
killed a Serb policeman," this Serb officer said. "We brought in the 
reinforcements to find the murderers. We replied in an appropriate 
way." The Kosovo Albanians see it differently. We are being forced 
to defend our position and civilians. October's truce was negotiated 
at the barrel of a gun. The U.S. threatened to bomb Serbian targets 
if it didn't pull most of its forces out of Kosovo, which Serbia did. 
2,000 international observers are monitoring the Serb forces that 
remain as well as Kosovo's guerilla army. But without the immediate 
threat of air strikes, they seem powerless to stop the fighting. I'm 
here to see if we can convince both sides that maybe this isn't the 
way to settle their differences. Everyone knew October's truce here 
would be temporary. The hope was it would last till spring. But the 
fighting has already forced refugees to flee their homes. And it's 
the heart of winter, the harshest of conditions. Richard Gizbert, 
ABC News, London.
