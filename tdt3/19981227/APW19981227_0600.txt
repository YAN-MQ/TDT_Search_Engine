Unidentified attackers burned down a church in a remote area in western 
India where a series of attacks on Christians since Christmas has 
terrorized the small community. A spokesman for the United Christian 
Forum for Human Rights, a lay group of Christians, gave no details 
of the attack in a village in Gujarat state. The area is 900 kilometers 
(550 miles) southwest of New Delhi. In the last two days, Hindu zealots 
have attacked two Catholic schools, one hospital and three churches. 
More than 10 people have also been injured by thrown stones. On Sunday, 
More than 1,000 Hindu right-wing activists held a demonstration in 
a village in central Gujarat and distributed pamphlets asking Christian 
missionaries to stop conversions and urging Hindus who had converted 
to return to their faith. Fearing further attacks, Christian groups 
have asked for police protection in some parts of Gujarat where there 
have been more than 40 instances of violence against the community 
this year. Christians say the violence is being fanned by Hindu right-wing 
groups closely linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. These 
groups are scheduled to hold demonstrations throughout Gujarat on 
Monday. India's national minorities commission Sunday urged the Gujarat 
government to ensure that violence against Christians is not repeated 
during the rallies are held. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has 
condemned the recent attacks on Christians. His government denies 
there is any orchestrated anti-Christian campaign.
