TWA officials say they expect most of their flights will take off 
as scheduled today. The airline had to cancel flights yesterday and 
Friday, after dozens of flight attendants called in sick to protest 
a snag in labor negotiations. Hundreds of passengers were left stranded. 
The situation improved slightly, after a federal judge issued a restraining 
order that requires TWA's unionized flight attendants to return to 
work. Many of them are unhappy with their current situation. From 
every passenger I've talked to today, they don't want to fly TWA again. 
That's not looking for for you twice if you don't have an airline 
to fly on. Well, that's too bad. That's the way it goes. I'm sick 
of this. Sick of being broke. I can't even make my mortgage this month 
because I don't have the money. The unionized flight attendants are 
seeking a new contract that would lift their wages closer to those 
at other major airlines.
