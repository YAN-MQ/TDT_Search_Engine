Food shortages in North Korea may be due in part to the type of rice 
that is planted in the country, according to findings of test cultivation 
in Japan by an agricultural expert, Kyodo News reported Sunday. The 
rice planted in North Korea has smaller yields and is less resistant 
to disease than the popular Japanese variety, Shoichi Ishii, president 
of an agricultural firm in northern Japan, was quoted as saying by 
Kyodo. Ishii planted the North Korean rice and Japanese ``Koshihikari'' 
rice in a 100-square-meter (yard) paddy field he owns in Shibata, 
in northern Japan, and grew the two varieties under identical conditions. 
The North Korean rice yielded less than 80 percent the harvest of 
the Koshihikari, he said. Ishii said diseases attacked the North Korean 
rice but had almost no effect on the Japanese rice. ``North Korea 
plants the same type of rice over and over again,'' he was quoted 
as saying, adding that may have caused its tolerance to weaken. Ishii 
said the comparative test proved his suspicion that the type of rice 
planted in North Korea may be a cause of the country's food shortages, 
and suggests that food conditions there ``may not improve as long 
as they continue to use the same kind of rice.'' He began the experiment 
after receiving inquiries from institutions including the Foreign 
Ministry. Ishii personally brought the North Korean rice seeds back 
to Japan after a visit to Pyongyang in 1996, Kyodo said.
