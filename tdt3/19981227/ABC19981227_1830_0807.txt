For the second time this week, a bus carrying Atlantic City gamblers 
has skidded off the road. This time, there were no deaths, but all 
31 people on board were injured. Funerals were held today for the 
eight people killed Christmas eve when their bus bound for Atlantic 
City skidded off the highway.
