If you happen to be driving around parts of Texas this holiday season, 
you'll want to be especially careful. But even the best road skills 
won't keep you from getting stopped by police. Dan Garcia with affiliate 
khou reports. Police in Angleton are watching holiday traffic this 
year just as they have every year in the past. But along with looking 
for traffic violators, they're looking for something else this year. 
They're looking for people who are driving safely. And if they see 
you being a good driver, you might be pulled over when you come to 
Angleton. Angleton's new police chief, David Ashburn, started the 
effort to reward good drivers for two reasons. He says it's helping 
build a bridge of goodwill between officers and the community, and 
this time of the year, it's also helping with something else. And 
I guess it's also a way to make people think a little more about safety. 
Well, we like to see people, you know, just generally being courteous 
drivers, observing the traffic laws, you know, using their signals 
when they change lanes. Utilizing their safety belts. So throughout 
his entire shift this holiday season, officer richard DeLeon and all 
of Angleton's finest are looking for people upholding the state's 
traffic laws. The reason we stopped you today is we're participating 
in what we call the safe driver reward program. And instead of getting 
a ticket, these safe drivers are getting a Coupon from one of several 
local restaurants for something free to eat. For most drivers, their 
initial reaction is the same. I was just surprised to see the lights 
on me. Has it been working? Well, one motorist we talked with said 
she'd read about the program in the local newspaper the same day it 
started. Since then, she'd been driving extra safely just in case 
she got stopped. That was Dan Garcia with our affiliate khou.
