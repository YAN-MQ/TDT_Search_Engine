A top U.S. diplomat voiced hope that the latest round of fighting 
in northern Kosovo can be contained after international monitors secured 
a temporary truce agreement with both sides. But daily clashes between 
Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels over the last four day bode 
poorly for chances of peace in the Serbian province, where at least 
13 people have been shot dead in the last four days. In a sometimes-fierce 
battle Sunday, artillery, mortar and machine-gun fire sounded for 
hours across the snowy fields of rebel-controlled territory as the 
two sides fought from trenches, villages and dirt roads. At least 
five people _ three Serb policeman, a Serb civilian and a Kosovo Liberation 
Army fighter _ were reported wounded as the worst period of violence 
in Kosovo in months continued. But William Walker, the American diplomat 
who heads the Kosovo Verification Mission, countered assumptions that 
a return to war is inevitable by stressing that the scope of violence 
remains limited. ``This is what I would call sporadic fighting,'' 
he told CNN after Sunday's clash ended. ``Both sides are being relatively 
cautious'' and not using full firepower, he said. ``We're trying to 
talk to both sides, get them to stand down, show some humanity one 
with the other in terms of getting the wounded out,'' the diplomat 
said. Verifiers from the 54-nation peace mission, led by the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, mediated the evacuation of 
two wounded Serbs and one ethnic Albanian after the fire fight. But 
the truce may be nothing more than a brief pause, based on past violation 
of pledges and the evidence on the ground. Both the guerrillas and 
a substantial number of Serb troops and armor remain entrenched in 
their standoff near the northern town of Podujevo, and there was no 
indication the shooting in several surrounding villages was over. 
Sunday's clash was attributed to the funeral of a Serb farmer whom 
the rebels killed the previous day. The Serbs said they needed to 
ensure the safety of other civilians while evacuating the body. The 
KLA complained that the heavy Serb buildup was a provocation that 
prevented civilians who fled the previous fighting from returning. 
A new trouble spot emerged Sunday night when Serb police sealed off 
a suburb of Kosovska Mitrovica and began searching for ``terrorists,'' 
their term for the rebels. The Serb-run Media Center said men in KLA 
uniforms had shot dead three Roma men, also known as Gypsies, in the 
town 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of the capital Pristina. Similar 
police actions this month following shootings blamed on the rebels 
have resulted in harsh crackdowns backed by tanks and artillery. Four 
days of clashes, centered on the KLA stronghold of Lapastica and neighboring 
Obranca, have tested an already shaky truce that has held through 
the late fall and winter across the secessionist province of Serbia, 
the dominant republic left in Yugoslavia. Despite an October agreement 
that halted more than seven months of fighting, neither side has shown 
a willingness to negotiate a settlement to their differences. The 
KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out of the 
predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian government says 
it will never let Kosovo go.
