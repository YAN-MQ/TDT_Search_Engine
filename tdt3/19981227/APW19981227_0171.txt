Frustrated filmmakers have criticized Thai authorities for refusing 
permit a remake of ``The King and I'' _ a Hollywood classic many Thais 
feel insults a former monarch _ to be shot on location. The Thai Film 
Board has said that 20th Century Fox has not done enough to ensure 
the monarchy would be respected in ``Anna and The King,'' starring 
Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat. Thai coordinators for the project and 
the screenwriter who tried to make a fifth version of the script palatable 
to Thai sensibilities called the board ``paranoid'' in a weekend news 
conference. ``There can be only one reason why the board didn't approve 
the fifth script, and that is fear,'' coordinator Malinee Chakraband 
was quoted as saying in Sunday's Bangkok Post. ``If it was so afraid 
that errors might happen, it should allow the filming here.'' Chakraband 
and her sister, both royal family members, said that Fox had invited 
unprecedented participation by Thai officialdom to get permission 
to film on location. After several script rejections, the studio announced 
last month it would shoot instead in neighboring Malaysia. The Thai 
coordinators and screenwriter Stanley Harper gave it one last try. 
``Fox has never before offered anyone to take part in its post-production,'' 
Harper was quoted as saying. ``This was enormous for them.'' The films 
``The King and I'' and the earlier ``Anna and The King of Siam,'' 
as Thailand was once known, were based on the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, 
a 19th century governess hired by King Mongkut to teach English to 
his children. Thais contend that Leonowens repeated unsubstantiated 
gossip and greatly exaggerated her own importance. Historians note 
that Mongkut _ a respected linguist and Buddhist scholar _ probably 
met her only once, if at all. Thais revere their monarchy. Insulting 
the king carries a prison term of up to 15 years. Though Mongkut's 
great-grandson, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, has seen ``The King and I'' 
and professes to enjoy it, the film is banned in Thailand.
