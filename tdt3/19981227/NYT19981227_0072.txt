Despite post-impeachment polls showing that the Republican Party's 
standing has sunk to its lowest level in years, leading Republicans 
insist they are not worried that the party will suffer long-term damage, 
because they expect the Senate to settle the matter quickly. This 
extraordinary sense of confidence has surprised some Republicans and 
many Democrats, who warn that it is far from certain that the Senate 
can avoid a prolonged, ugly impeachment trial. They contend that just 
as voters punished Republicans for the government shutdown and never 
forgave President Bush for reneging on his no-new-taxes pledge, the 
public might still blame Republicans in the 2000 election for an impeachment 
inquiry that disrupted the nation. But in dozens of interviews, prominent 
Republicans on Capitol Hill and far beyond this city contended that 
voters would reward politicians who fearlessly pressed on _ even against 
the polls _ and followed their convictions. ``There's no question 
about the short-term damage,'' said former Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, 
an influential conservative who expects the coming presidential campaign 
to obscure the White House scandal. ``The only reason that I'm not 
in full panic mode about the long-term damage is I think the presidential 
race will to a great degree define the parties going into 2000.'' 
Gov. John Engler of Michigan put it this way: ``This will be long 
past by 2000. And those who defended the president most vigorously 
may be the ones most embarrassed.'' Other Republicans expressed less 
certainty about the outcome but said they had no alternative but to 
plunge forward rather than allow themselves to be swayed by scenarios 
of what may or may not happen. Though they may cite principles, the 
Republicans are being prodded toward the Senate trial by intense pressure 
from conservatives; many want to see Clinton forced out of office, 
no matter the repercussions for the party. And conservatives are some 
Republican senators' most outspoken and reliable supporters. ``In 
the long run this will not be damaging to the Republican Party,'' 
said former Vice President Dan Quayle, a favorite of conservatives 
who is expected to run for president in 2000. ``I'll be very surprised 
in November of 2000 if Democrats are going to make the impeachment 
of Bill Clinton an issue _ whether he's there or not. The American 
people aren't going to want to rehash that.'' Dismissing the notion 
of a protracted trial as ``scare tactics'' from Democrats, Quayle 
said: ``I don't think this will drag out. The Senate won't let that 
happen.'' Even the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, 
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, agreed with Republicans who thought voter 
unease about the impeachment matter would fade. ``The American people 
are going to quickly look beyond that,'' he said. ``If you get a political 
party in the year 2000 that says, `I'm going to better educate your 
child,' the people will forget this.'' Conceding that his comments 
were at odds with other Democrats who think Republicans are damaging 
themselves, Romer said, ``I could have taken a hard partisan shot 
here and tried to help Democrats, but I just don't think it's true.'' 
Many other Democrats disagreed. ``If I were running as a Democrat 
in the year 2000, I'd be after those guys from right now,'' said former 
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential 
nominee in 1988. ``They say memories are short,'' he said of Republicans. 
``I'm not so sure.'' He said Republicans should remember their surprisingly 
poor showing in the midterm elections this year. ``Something rather 
big happened in November,'' Dukakis said. ``How do you explain that?'' 
Some Republicans _ Gov. George E. Pataki of New York has been one 
of the most outspoken _ have also warned that the party was undermining 
itself in its handling of the Clinton scandal. Their fear is that 
Democrats will portray Republicans as blindly partisan in their zeal 
to topple the president. Already, Democrats are seizing on the House 
impeachment vote for political advantage. They are plotting to find 
potent Democratic opponents to take on moderate House Republicans 
who supported impeachment, such as Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut. 
And in a small but troubling development for Republicans, local election 
officials around the country in recent days have reported that some 
voters are switching their party registration from Republican to Democrat. 
``There's a big risk for control of the House in the year 2000,'' 
said Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont, one of the most moderate Republicans. 
``Certainly the impeachment process is going to be fresh in people's 
minds. Unless we can change that present huge dip in confidence of 
people in the polls, we're going to have a tough time.'' Many Republicans 
said the best evidence that they were not driven by partisanship was 
that if Clinton was ousted from office and Vice President Al Gore 
was thrust into the presidency, that would give Gore an edge in the 
2000 campaign. ``If he becomes president I think he'd be very ineffectual,'' 
said Quayle, who was Gore's predecessor. ``But it's easier to run 
as an incumbent president than as a vice president.'' Jeffords said 
there would be ``public sympathy for somebody who gets thrust into 
that job in unusual circumstances.'' Yet others questioned that popular 
wisdom. ``There's as much to argue that Gore would be weaker once 
people got exposure to what he would stand for as president,'' Engler 
said. Whatever the electoral consequences for the party, many Republicans, 
particularly senators who are faced with deciding Clinton's fate, 
spoke with a sense of resignation, saying the party has little choice 
but to move forward. ``Look, I can read the polls, I see what they 
say,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio. ``I'm aware that the visceral 
reaction when I talk to people in Ohio is basically, `Make it go away.' 
I understand that. But the House has set in motion a constitutional 
process that has only been set in process once before. For us to duck 
our responsibility because it's the easiest thing to do is morally 
wrong. I can't worry about what this means in an election in the year 
2000.'' Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, said: ``They didn't hire 
me to respond to every poll that came along. I'm not a weather vane. 
I've always said that to the people at home and they understand it: 
They're paying me to use my best judgment.'' Still, most prominent 
Republicans interviewed around the country cling to the belief that 
they can weather the scandal. ``My own feeling is that the American 
people have a very short attention span,'' said Lyn Nofziger, a former 
aide to President Reagan. ``We've got more than a year ahead of us. 
I just don't see any way to say the Republicans are in trouble or 
the Democrats are in trouble.'' ``I don't think they're going to throw 
him out,'' he added, saying that senators ``owe it to the process 
to go ahead and have a trial and make people stand up and bed.'' Weber 
said that while ``the real wild card is a prolonged Senate trial with 
an uncertain outcome,'' that could be damaging to the Democrats, too, 
because ``it could be at that point that the case against the president 
does begin to resonate with the public.'' But like many other Republicans, 
Weber made the point that timing is everything. ``If we were on the 
eve of an off-year election, I'd say we were facing a disaster,'' 
he said. ``Of course, we just had one, didn't we?''
