Even before the kickoff, it was already the best party that all those 
formerly frustrated New York Jets' followers have ever had, a Sunday 
without stress. With the Jets assured of first place, the burgers 
and the beer tasted better in the parking lot, and as 74,302 stood 
to cheer the introductions, hundreds, if not thousands, of all those 
formerly frustrated followers were dressed better in their green jerseys 
with ``Chrebet'' and ``K. Johnson'' and ``Lewis'' and ``Martin'' on 
the back. Especially those with ``Testaverde'' on the back. More than 
any other Jet, quarterback Vinny Testaverde was the life of Sunday's 
party with four touchdown passes as the Jets soared toward the Super 
Bowl XXXIII playoffs with a 31-10 rout of the Patriots. But that was 
only fitting. More than any other Jet, he has been the life of the 
team. And looking to the Jan. 10 divisional playoff at Giants Stadium, 
coach Bill Parcells said, ``I'm leaning on Testaverde.'' Leaning hard. 
You can't win in the National Football League without a quality quarterback. 
After all those dubious seasons in Tampa Bay and Cleveland and Baltimore, 
the 35-year-old Testaverde is now a quality quarterback with a quality 
record: in his 13 starts, the Jets are 12-1. Over the season, Testaverde's 
passing stats are 259 completions in 421 attempts for 3,256 yards, 
29 touchdowns and only seven interceptions _ the fourth best touchdown-to-interception 
season ratio in NFL history behind Steve DeBerg, Bart Starr and Steve 
Bartkowski. Those 29 touchdown passes set a franchise record, surpassing 
the 26 thrown by both Al Dorow of the original 1960 Titans and by 
Joe Namath in 1967 around the time when Testaverde, then a youngster 
in Elmont, Long Island, put Broadway Joe's photo on his bedroom wall 
in the family home. But when Testaverde was asked about breaking the 
record shared by Namath, he talked about how Namath played in a ``different 
time,'' how ``it's been a dream season,'' and how ``I'm enjoying everything, 
but I'm not one to talk about it.'' Maybe he still reveres Namath 
too much. Quarterbacks are rated on how many correct decisions they 
make _ when and where to throw a pass, when and where not to throw 
a pass, when to throw it away, when to take a sack, when to scramble. 
And when Parcells was asked to assess Testaverde, he talked about 
those decisions. ``He's making the prudent choice,'' the coach said. 
``He's using good judgment.'' But when Testaverde was deemed expendable 
by the Baltimore Ravens in late June, he had a career decision to 
make. In addition to the Jets, the Seattle Seahawks and the Cincinnati 
Bengals wanted to sign him. ``If I made one right decision all year 
long,'' he said, ``it was the decision to come to play for Bill Parcells.'' 
At the time, however, Parcells was saying that Glenn Foley would ``get 
the benefit of the doubt'' at quarterback. ``I just had a good feeling 
about it, even when the coach told me Glenn would be the starter,'' 
Testaverde recalled. ``For the first time, I was going to be around 
players and coaches from this area. And for me to be home with my 
family and friends made it all the more enjoyable.'' Testaverde waited 
his turn, and when Foley sputtered and his turn came, he made the 
most of it. ``He did it with professional preparation,'' said Dan 
Henning, the Jets' quarterback coach. ``He's meticulous. He was mad 
at himself today for throwing that one interception. He knew he made 
a mistake.'' In guiding the Jets to their first 12-victory season, 
Testaverde hasn't made many mistakes. ``He's a leader,'' said Keyshawn 
Johnson, the Pro Bowl wide receiver with 10 touchdown receptions. 
``He knows exactly what he's looking for. He's aware of the reads. 
He throws a hard ball, but it's very accurate. Because he throws it 
so hard, it can get through a particular defender.'' Keith Byars, 
now a Jets fullback, has been in the NFL throughout Testaverde's career. 
``I've watched Vinny a long time and the difference now is night and 
day,'' Byars said. ``He has so much more confidence and poise. He's 
a leader in the huddle and on the sideline. He quit making this harder 
than what it is and learned to use the people around him. He's going 
to throw the ball to whoever's open.'' And 29 times this season ``throwing 
the ball to whoever's open'' has produced a touchdown. ``Being able 
to throw to Curtis Martin and Keith Byars, to Keyshawn Johnson and 
Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward made a big difference for me,'' Testaverde 
said. ``Get them the ball and let them do the work.'' But in any passing 
attack, the quarterback has to do the work first. And if he does it 
well enough for a 12-1 record as a starter, he's the life of the party.
