Although novelists have written plays, and playwrights have written 
novels, it is rare for a writer to be equally adept at both arts, 
with one definite exception being Samuel Beckett. But at 43, Beckett's 
countryman Sebastian Barry seems well on his way to such an accomplishment. 
``The Steward of Christendom'' (presented last year at the Brooklyn 
Academy of Music) is a harrowing drama about the redemption of Dublin's 
last police chief before Irish independence. Barry's 1998 play, ``Our 
Lady of Sligo,'' acclaimed at the Royal National Theater in London 
and at the Abbey Theater in Dublin, is his darkest, most mordant work. 
With his second and latest novel, ``The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty,'' 
Barry shows a command of the narrative form and the lyrical sweep 
of his poetic Irish predecessors. Eneas is the latest in Barry's empathetic 
gallery of exiles, a peaceful man who is treated as a pariah in his 
community. Through the life of his title character, the author depicts 
the cruel paradoxes in 20th-century Ireland. Barry is part of a wave 
of talented and remarkably prolific new Irish playwrights that includes 
Martin McDonagh, Billy Roche and Conor McPherson. ``The Beauty Queen 
of Leenane'' is the first in McDonagh's ``Connemara Trilogy'' about 
working-class people in provincial Ireland. Roche, whose work has 
not yet been seen on the New York stage, wrote ``The Wexford Trilogy,'' 
dealing with the grittiness of day-to-day life in his hometown. McPherson 
has moved from the boy's-night-out world of ``This Lime Tree Bower'' 
to spectral tales like ``St. Nicholas'' (a one-man play acted off-Broadway 
last season by Brian Cox) and ``The Weir,'' scheduled for Broadway 
this season. These four writers and others, including Marina Carr, 
are in the great Irish tradition, from O'Casey and Synge through Beckett 
and on to Brian Friel. Barry's plays and his novel are inspired by 
moments in the lives of the author's relatives, who have been neglected 
by history and forgotten by their own family. Through his art, he 
reinvents them as dramatic characters. In a recent interview, he explored 
his motivation for writing what he calls ghost plays: ``If some of 
the people in your family have been erased _ for religious reasons 
or for what they have done _ that means that part of yourself has 
been erased.'' His search is for the metaphorical DNA that links him 
with his ancestors. Through Barry's work, theatergoers and readers 
can track the genealogy of his family of characters, as well as the 
course of Ireland. The title character in his new novel, based on 
his great-uncle, is an Irishman without a country. Unable to find 
work in Ireland before World War I, he becomes a British merchant 
seaman. Later he joins the Royal Irish Constabulary. Although he is 
regarded as a traitor to the cause of Irish independence, he is a 
hero who stoically follows his heart, placing morality above patriotism. 
In a reading of his work at New York University's Ireland House, Barry 
chose a pivotal section in which Eneas is threatened by a childhood 
friend who demands that he leave Ireland or face assassination. Like 
his Virgilian namesake, Eneas becomes a wanderer. Speaking about his 
great-uncle, an outcast like Eneas, he said, ``I was trying to restore 
him in the book of life, and, ironically, the only way I could do 
that was to invent a life for him.'' His fictionalization is, he said, 
``a lie of a life, but it's the only life I can give back to this 
man.'' Descriptive details differ, but the essence remains, the tragic 
story of a man _ fact and fiction _ trapped by his own and his nation's 
history. Similarly ``The Steward of Christendom'' was inspired by 
the life of his great-grandfather, a police chief who was demonized 
by his neighbors as an agent of the British. The title character in 
``Our Lady of Sligo'' is his grandmother, Mai O'Hara, who, along with 
her husband, waged a private war against the injustices of Irish nationalism. 
``A fearsome and dangerous creature,'' Mai died two years before her 
grandson was born. ``I can't say that the play presents her as a wonderful 
role model,'' he said, ``but it does give her a place in the world. 
That pleases me, to have done that strange service for my grandmother.'' 
``Eneas McNulty'' started out as a play. Unable to complete it to 
his satisfaction, he put it aside. The problem with making it a play, 
he said, was that Eneas was not a reflective man. ``Confusion, as 
Friel said, is not an ignoble condition, but Eneas is perpetually 
confused. That didn't seem to work in a play,'' Barry said. ``It's 
like forcing a person to speak when he has no intention of speaking.'' 
When he picked it up again, it seemed to fit naturally into the novelistic 
form. In the manner of George Bernard Shaw, who grouped his work into 
Plays Pleasant and Plays Unpleasant, Barry set out to write seven 
Plays Familial. But he wrote only six. For him ``Eneas McNulty'' completes 
the cycle. Now he is thinking about writing what he refers to as a 
public play, dealing more directly with events in contemporary Irish 
history. Barry traces his interest in theater to his childhood. His 
mother, Joan O'Hara, is a leading actress with the Abbey Theater; 
his father was an architect who had written poetry as a young man. 
As a boy of 7 he was taken to the theater to see his mother work. 
After leaving her in her dressing room, he was led to his seat in 
the audience. As he spoke about the momentous day, he seemed to project 
himself back in time as he watched his mother in Yeats' ``Cathleen 
ni Hoolihan'': ``I can see the stage very black, and this old, old 
woman walks toward me and starts to speak, `I am Cathleen, the daughter 
Hoolihan.' '' He knew that the actress was his mother but he remembers 
thinking, ``How would I be able to go home with this old, old woman?'' 
It did not occur to him that there was a difference between his mother 
offstage and in character. He is still perplexed by the magic of the 
acting process. ``In a way, I still haven't sorted that out. The difference 
now is that I don't want to sort it out.'' He said he was less influenced 
by writers than by ``that vanished company of Abbey actors.'' Subsequently, 
as an observer of his own work, he marvels how Donal McCann in ``The 
Steward of Christendom,'' Sinead Cusack in ``Our Lady of Sligo'' and 
others transform themselves. Although he often went to the Abbey as 
a young man, for years he avoided working in the theater because he 
considered it his mother's world. While studying Latin at Trinity 
College in Dublin, he wrote fiction and poetry. Discouraged by life 
in Ireland and by what he thought was a pervasive air of corruption, 
he moved to the Continent, spending most of his time in Paris, where 
he wrote for the next eight years. When he returned to Dublin, he 
met the actress who was to become his wife. After she left for a few 
weeks to work in a series for the BBC, he decided to write a play, 
in emulation of Garcia Lorca, who was said to have written one in 
two weeks. The result, completed quickly, was ``Boss Grady's Boys.'' 
His wife, Alison, read it and suggested he send it to the Abbey, which 
presented it in 1988 in a production starring Eamon Kelly, who was 
so pleased with the work that he wrote on a poster, ``Well done, Sebastian. 
You turned Dublin's head.'' With his first play, Barry found the theater 
to be ``entirely addictive.'' Looking back, he admitted an earlier 
resistance. ``In the arrogance of my youth, I had considered playwriting 
to be not quite as admirable as poetry or even fiction,'' he said. 
``Now it seems to me the strength of a play is that it exists very 
clearly on that little stage in the back of your mind, and then it 
exists when it's produced.'' His mother has acted in several of his 
plays. She inspired the character of the daughter in ``Our Lady of 
Sligo.'' In that play, her mother describes her as ``this child of 
mine, going off in the morning to dance about in next to nothing I 
suppose in foreign plays, written by fellas with hard little bitter 
names, Gorky and the like.'' Just as he believes that politics are 
changing in Ireland, opening the country to new freedoms, Barry sees 
a greater expansiveness among Irish writers, especially in the theater. 
``The real sea change is that you don't feel that spirit being diminished 
in your own country,'' he said. ``Maybe that's what's given rise to 
this fountain of plays. It's like a stain being taken off a picture. 
Strange birds can fly unmolested now in Irish writing.'' With ``The 
Beauty Queen of Leenane'' continuing on Broadway and ``The Weir'' 
forthcoming, Barry said, only half jokingly, that ``Our Lady of Sligo'' 
would probably not be done in New York until next season because ``there 
is room only for one Irish play a year on Broadway.'' Recently, he 
has been immersing himself in another theatrical form, collaborating 
with Martha Clarke on a projected Broadway version of the Frank Loesser 
movie musical ``Hans Christian Andersen.'' For the show, he is creating 
a new book, the opposite of the fanciful Danny Kaye film, and, it 
would seem, a new and more authentic persona for Andersen, one with 
an antipathy to children. Asked if there were any way one of his relatives 
could be worked into the musical, he said, ``I have a terrible feeling 
that in the end it will be a version of my Great-Uncle Harry. I'm 
not sure I can work any other way.'' Then, in what could be a description 
of his creative process, he said, ``It's just the harvesting of things 
you accidentally know.''
