German media giant Kirch Gruppe refused to comment Sunday on a report 
that Rupert Murdoch hopes to take a dlrs 1 billion stake in the new 
holding company being formed through its restructuring. Along with 
Murdoch's News Corp., this week's Focus magazine reported the other 
two international investors would be Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed 
bin Talal and Italian media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi. It said Prince 
al Waleed is aiming to invest about dlrs 350 million to dlrs 450 million 
in the holding company, to be called Taurus, which covers Kirch's 
core business activities of film licensing, film production and television. 
Berlusconi would join through a share swap that would bring 13 percent 
of his Mediaset SpA under the Kirch holding company, the report said, 
citing unidentified Italian media executives as sources. It said all 
prospective partners were in agreement that Kirch would remain the 
majority shareholder in the restructured group. It said talks were 
to continue in Milan on Monday to work out details for Taurus to buy 
programming from News Corp.'s Fox network in the United States. Kirch 
has been in talks with international investors for months, and has 
said it expects them to be finalized by the end of the year. A spokesman 
declined Sunday to comment on the Focus report. The entire operation 
has been valued between at least dlrs 2.4 billion to dlrs 3 billion, 
according to media reports.
