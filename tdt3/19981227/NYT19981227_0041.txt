Fast-moving disturbances will streak from the central Rockies through 
the Southeast then northeast along the Atlantic Seaboard bringing 
areas of cloud and patchy precipitation during the next few days. 
A separate, stronger storm system will move east from the Dakotas 
surrounded by gusty winds and areas of snow. By Tuesday night, the 
separate disturbances will join forces over the East, bringing a risk 
of a period of heavier rain and some snow from the Middle Atlantic 
Coast to New England. Monday will be cloudy from the central Gulf 
of Mexico coast to the Northeast. A bit of rain will brush the New 
England coast. Meanwhile, a flow of moist air from the southeast will 
promote heavier showers near low pressure as it moves over Alabama 
and Georgia. Farther north, patchy light rain will develop near the 
southern Appalachians, which may begin as freezing rain in some higher 
elevations. Mainly dry and tranquil weather will prevail from the 
southern Great Lakes to the southern Plains. Farther north, clouds 
and areas of light snow will occur near a front marking the boundary 
between relative mild air and the Arctic air covering most of Canada. 
As low pressure develops along the front, strong winds will buffet 
the slopes of the northern and central Rockies. Periods of snow will 
be common along west-facing slopes where moist winds ascend the terrain. 
Brisk onshore winds will keep the Northwest unsettled with coastal 
rain and mountain snow. The Southwest will stay mild and dry. FOCUS: 
ICY ADVISORIES This winter, the National Weather Service in Little 
Rock, Ark., will begin issuing advisories for a phenomenon called 
freezing fog, which can lead to slick roadways. Usually, the tiny 
water droplets from fog or drizzle freeze without rupturing. A white 
hue can be seen on roads as the air trapped within the droplets leads 
to a visible coating of ice called rime. Sometimes an invisible icing 
occurs when the droplets rupture and freeze upon striking the cold 
ground. A translucent glaze known as black ice then clings to the 
road for the unsuspecting driver to encounter.
