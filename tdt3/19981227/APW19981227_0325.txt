One major obstacle to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election 
was removed Sunday when a top contender within his Likud party dropped 
out of the race. However, a challenge to Netanyahu's leadership from 
within was announced by Uzi Landau, 55, chairman of the powerful Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. In addition, Benny Begin, the 
son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and one of the Likud's 
most staunchly right-wing members, has decided to form a new rightist 
party and run for prime minister. Begin is set to announce his candidacy 
on Monday. But the Likud candidate seen as having the best chance 
of unseating Netanyahu, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, took himself 
out of the race for Likud leader Sunday. Olmert, a hawk who has campaigned 
for building the controversial Har Homa neighborhood in traditionally 
Arab east Jerusalem, was the only party member with enough stature 
in Likud to have a fighting chance against Netanyahu. However, Olmert 
reportedly decided to bow out after failing to enlist the support 
of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who is popular among the Sephardim, 
or Jews from Middle East countries. Mordechai, a moderate who has 
urged Netanyahu to accelerate the peace process with the Palestinians, 
has said he will not bail out of the Likud party and is sticking by 
Netanyahu, Israel Radio said. Although he said he would not interfere 
in Israel's political battles, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat complained 
Sunday that Netanyahu's government had halted implementation of the 
Wye peace accord. ``The Israeli side has frozen completely everything,'' 
said Arafat. The string of political announcements came in advance 
of the Likud Central Committee meeting later Sunday. The panel is 
to set the stage for selecting a party leader and begin the process 
of choosing the candidates for the Knesset. The Likud candidate is 
expected to face Labor Party leader Ehud Barak in elections, the date 
for which is expected to be set by parliament soon. But there are 
also several candidates forming centrist parties that could complicate 
the picture. Recently retired chief-of-staff, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, 
is expected to run in a centrist party. Landau, meanwhile represents 
the right wing within Likud that has been dismayed by Netanyahu's 
flip-flops on policy issues. ``Likud has become the party of the moment 
with a leader who changes course according to the direction of the 
wind. Such victory is not a genuine victory,'' Landau told a Tel Aviv 
news conference where he announced his candidacy. The hard-liners 
were also deeply disappointed by Netanyahu's signing of the Wye accord, 
which set the stage for three further withdrawals from the West Bank. 
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who has accused Netanyahu of 
destroying Likud, threw his weight behind Landau. ``Benjamin Netanyahu 
should be replaced,'' Shamir was quoted as saying in an interview 
with the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. ``This isn't the Likud I knew as 
prime minister.''
