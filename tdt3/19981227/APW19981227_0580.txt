MILAN, Italy (AP) _ U.S. track and field star Marion Jones was picked 
as the best woman athlete of 1998 in a survey by Italy's largest sports 
daily, Gazzetta dello Sport of Milan. Possibly helped by a bit of 
nationalism, Italian cyclist Marco Pantani led the men's lists ahead 
of Ethiopian long distance runner Haile Gebrselassie. Marion Jones, 
the American sprinter and long jumper who won 40 of 41 events contested 
this year, got 480 points in the survey. French sprinter Christine 
Arron finished second with 333 points with U.S. swimmer Jenny Thompson 
third with 321. Pantani, winner of the Tours of Italy and France, 
led Gebrselassie 476 to 457 points. Another long distance runner, 
Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, edged Formula One world champion Mika 
Hakkinen for third place. France's soccer team, the 1998 World Cup 
titlist, led the team's vote with 299 points, ahead of Yugoslavia's 
basketball team which got 238. The Chicago Bulls of NBA were only 
sixth.
