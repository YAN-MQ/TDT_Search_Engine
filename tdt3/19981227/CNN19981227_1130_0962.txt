The millennium is a global party that happens only once every 1,000 
years. And if you haven't made special plans yet, you may be too late. 
Susan Lisovicz talked with some travel agents about unique ways to 
ring in the big 2000. How would you like to spend new year's eve 2000 
in Paris -- and New York? $40,000 will buy you the ticket on the Concorde, 
and a story worth telling. Or for $10,000 a head, consider cruising 
across the international date line. You can be among the first and 
last to experience the new millennium. Travel agents are already busy 
booking specials for the millennium, at premiums of 20% to 100%. Even 
people who have a fair amount of resources are saying, "well, I am 
not sure I want to pay twice the price that I normally would for something 
like that." Disney world is already sold out. Some cruises are also 
already booked, but most lines have 20% to 50% of capacity remaining. 
The highest demand for year-end travel is expected in places like 
Australia and New Zealand, which will be the first to usher in 2000, 
as well as the holy land, Vienna and Tokyo. In New York City, although 
the ball will drop only once, there will be 24 celebrations for each 
time zone. Some of New York's hotels are sold out, but many still 
have space. Probably around 56%, by our survey, that have not even 
begun to book for new year's eve. Finally, travel planners suggest 
those who fear year 2000 computer glitches should plan accordingly. 
I myself am planning on being somewhere where if I can't get back 
home, I wouldn't mind staying. That's "your money," Susan Lisovicz, 
"CNN Financial News," New York.
