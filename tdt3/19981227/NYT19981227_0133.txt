Norman Richardson, Hofstra's silky forward, did not take long in explaining 
why he chose a relatively obscure college over more prestigious options. 
``I knew they were a rising program,'' he said. ``I'm happy I came.'' 
Hofstra Coach Jay Wright, sitting next to Richardson at a post-game 
news conference, then responded, ``Me too, Stormy,'' and planted a 
kiss on Richardson's head. Love was in the air at Madison Square Garden 
Sunday after Hofstra's 67-62 victory over Pennsylvania in the championship 
game of the ECAC Holiday Festival, though just minutes before the 
atmosphere had been laced with tension. Penn (3-3) slashed Hofstra's 
20-point lead to 2 on one occasion and then to 3 in the final 96 seconds. 
On Saturday night, Wright read to his team the names of Kentucky and 
Ohio State and other past tournament winners to illustrate the significance 
of what his team could accomplish Sunday. Hofstra lost to Georgia 
Tech and Manhattan in its only other ECAC tournament appearance, in 
1996. Richardson, the tournament's most valuable player who was supported 
by 15 points from guard Jason Hernandez and 12 from forward Roberto 
Gittens, was also told about previous most valuable players such as 
Lew Alcindor and Chris Mullin. ``I know I'll go down in history,'' 
Richardson said. In the consolation game, Georgia Tech (9-3) outrebounded 
Iona by 53-38 and made eight more free throws than the Gaels for a 
72-65 victory. Jason Floyd (11 points) hit a 3-pointer to put the 
Yellow Jackets ahead for good with 4:22 remaining, igniting a 10-2 
spurt. Tech forward Jason Collier had 19 points. Center Alvin Jones 
had 10 points and 19 rebounds, and guard Tony Akins added 16 points. 
``We're the best 4-7 team in America,'' Iona coach Jeff Ruland said. 
Hofstra repelled Penn's final comeback bid with the sticky man-to-man 
defense that typified the Flying Dutchmen's play in their impressive 
upset of Georgia Tech on Saturday. The Quakers were trailing, 65-62, 
with 15.5 seconds to go and were taking the ball out of bounds at 
their end of the court. After Matt Langel and Michael Jordan, two 
of Penn's best 3-point shooters, passed the ball back and forth, it 
came back to Jordan, who found a sliver of room in the corner on the 
baseline with two seconds to go. As Hernandez leaped with an arm extended, 
Jordan flicked his jumper off the far side of the rim, and Richardson 
grabbed the rebound. He made two free throws with two-tenths of a 
second left to set off Hofstra's second subdued celebration in two 
days. ``I'm almost numb right now,'' Wright said. ``This is a great 
day for our program.'' Hofstra (7-4) had come close to returning to 
the anonymity from which it came. Uncanny 3-point shooting (11 of 
17) and a tolerable 11 turnovers enabled the Dutchmen to offset poor 
free-throw shooting (15 of 23) down the stretch against the careful 
Quakers, who had only seven turnovers. Richardson put the Dutchmen 
over the top. He hit 4 of 5 3-point attempts in scoring 16 points 
and had 9 rebounds on the heels of a 23-point effort against Georgia 
Tech. Hofstra, which shot 50 percent for the game, tightened down 
the stretch. Penn forward Jed Ryan scored 7 of his 14 points during 
a frantic 14-0 surge to bring the Quakers to 62-60 with 1 minute 36 
seconds to go. Hofstra's point guard, Craig Claxton (8 points, 7 assists), 
said he distracted himself from the tightness by focusing on making 
a play. The junior broke to his right, sending the defensive flow 
his way, then rifled a cross-court pass to Hernandez. Hernandez buried 
a 3-pointer to give Hofstra a 65-60 lead. Jordan rattled in a layup 
to close the gap to 3 points with 43 seconds to go. After Gittens 
missed the front end of a one-and-one, Jordan had a last shot at tying 
the game. ``It was a long way to come back, and we didn't give ourselves 
enough time,'' Penn guard Matt Langel, who had 14 points, said.
