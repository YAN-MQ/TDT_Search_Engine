When "NBC nightly news" continues in a moment -- the race to restore 
electrical power to ice storm victims in southern states. The brutal 
Russian winter turning frontier towns into ghost towns. And later 
-- in "focus," an old Warriors war to keep his native language alive. 
But with gateway you get basic help over the phone for as long as 
you own it. After a month, you pay for it. Here, you get a color printer. 
Nope, not here. This one you can trade in toward the purchase of a 
new one after two years. Yours forever. Still think they look alike? 
We'll build you a PC 99 like this one for $1,598 or $45 a month. Call 
1-800-gateway and get more out of the box.
