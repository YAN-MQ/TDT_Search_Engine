Burma says it sold more than $4 million worth of precious stones at 
a four-day annual gem show and auction in Rangoon. Statewide media 
says the auction attracted 200 gems traders in 10 countries, as well 
as more than 100 local gem merchants. Among the items sold were precious 
stones, jades, jade carvings, pearls and jewelry. The Burmese government 
has a monopoly on jade.
