``Que would happen if, wenn Du open your computerzo finde eine message 
in esta lingua? No es Englando, no est Germano, no este Espana, no 
est keine known lingua aber Du Understande!'' No, this isn't some 
kind of garbled translation program. It's a message in Europanto, 
a linguistic amalgam created by Diego Marani, a translator for the 
European Council of Ministers in Brussels, Belgium. Marani figured 
that if Europe could come up with a single currency, why not a single 
language? European Union members frequently communicate in English 
even though it is not the native language of most members. ``It is 
intended to give voice to the frustrations of the vast majority of 
people who are forced to use English,'' Marani said, ``even though 
their command of the language is not very good.'' So he wants to ``europantize'' 
English. After all, he notes, ``there are many words such as blitzkrieg, 
pizza and leitmotif that everybody understands.'' A native of Italy, 
Marani conceived Europanto while observing the language wars in Belgium 
and listening to the polyglots at the Council of Ministers in Brussels 
struggling to find a common tongue for casual hallway encounters. 
Drawing from Italian, French, Dutch and English _ languages he speaks 
fluently _ Marani began writing lessons in Europanto for an internal 
publication of the council. An officer of the council passed the publication 
to the editor of a Belgian weekly, Le Soir Illustre. The paper began 
publishing Marani's lessons in Europanto in December 1996, with the 
double-edged slogan, ``Absurd times call for absurd solutions.'' The 
lessons soon became a cult hit, offering useful tips that more traditional 
language courses might overlook. In the lesson, ``Aan der diskoteka,'' 
Euro and Eura, the Dick and Jane of Europanto, meet at a nightclub. 
``Wat esse teine supportebra size?'' Euro asks. To which Eura might 
counter with, ``Wat make? Me palpe el behind.'' (What are you doing? 
Keep your hands to yourself.) Belgium is a logical birthplace for 
a common tongue. Sandwiched between the Netherlands and France, Belgium 
claims both country's languages. The result is that Dutch-speakers 
have been waging a bitter war of words with their French-speaking 
compatriots for centuries. Enter a restaurant, address the maitre 
d'hotel in the wrong language, and you may find yourself dining on 
cold pommes frites. ``The language issue in Belgium is a very stupid 
one,'' says Marani, who has lived in Brussels for 10 years. ``It is 
the first thing a foreigner notices.'' The quest for a single lingua 
franca to remedy the punishment for the Tower of Babel goes back centuries. 
As the semiotician Umberto Eco has explained, Irish grammarians argued 
in a seventh-century document that Gaelic overcame the confusion of 
Babel. ``All that was best in each language, all there was that was 
grand and beautiful, was cut out and retained in Irish,'' he writes 
of their work in his new book, ``Serendipities.'' There are more modern 
examples, like Esperanto. (Or, for that matter, Frenglish, Spanglish 
or Englitalian). Invented in 1887 by L.L. Zamenhof, who lived in Warsaw, 
Esperanto never caught on, although it still has loyal speakers. Not 
surprisingly, the World Esperanto Association in Rotterdam does not 
consider Europanto an alternative to the century-old language. ``It 
has no definite structure, it's not a language,'' Nikolas Rasic, a 
conference secretary, said of Marani's invention. ``I am a professional 
linguist. What is he? A clerk?'' (Indeed, Marani said that he receives 
``letters from angry Esperantists,'' and added, ``They think I am 
plotting against them, but they are many and I am only one.'') But 
who knows? Over time, perhaps recalcitrant Esperantists may come around. 
Even Rasic conceded: ``I read it and I thought it was funny. The purpose 
of Esperanto is to bring the world together. If some other language 
can do it, OK'' Rasic is right about Europanto's grammatical structure; 
there is none. ``I see it instinctively, I feel the grammar inside 
of me,'' Marani says. ``It's like playing the guitar or painting a 
picture.'' Despite the problem of getting other people to ``feel'' 
the grammar, the French publisher Fayard plans a January release for 
``Las Adventuras des Inspector Cabillot,'' stories in Europanto about 
a bumbling detective at the fictional European Agency of Strange Matters. 
Il Minotauro, an Italian publisher, will also publish Cabillot stories 
under the title ``Adelanto mit Europanto.'' Marani says he has already 
received hundreds of communications from Europanto fans around the 
globe. He adds that the Swiss and Canadians, with their own linguistically 
divided countries, show particular interest. At times, Marani takes 
a lighthearted approach to his creation. But in less humble moments 
he declares that Europanto is a harbinger of the future of English 
in the new common Europe. Whether or not his grandiose prediction 
is true, few could argue with his critical assessment: ``Language 
in Europe is at a critical juncture. It is going to be a mess.''
