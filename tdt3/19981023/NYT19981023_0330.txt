Eric Ambler, whose name is synonymous with novels of suspense, action, 
adventure and intrigue in foreign lands and whose books became models 
for generations of other writers, died Oct. 22 at his home in London. 
He was 89. Ambler, a worldly Englishman, is generally credited with 
having raised the thriller to the level of literature. He brought 
intellectual substance to the genre at a time when it often suffered 
from shortages of surprise, maturity, verisimilitude and literary 
skill. He did that by writing a half-dozen eloquent novels that were 
published, and widely applauded, between 1936 and 1940. Those books, 
set mostly in Europe, painted haunting panoramas of intrigue and villainy. 
They were also distinguished by credible heroes, realistic settings 
and vivid evocations of the nervous, politically-charged years that 
led to World War II. His early feat still fascinates literary historians. 
Peter Lewis of the University of Durham in England wrote in a 1990 
book: ``Ambler raised the thriller from the subliterary depths, showing 
that the genre and good prose were not incompatible, and redeeming 
its conventions for more serious purposes than the display of macho 
derring-do. Virtually single-handedly, he redefined the thriller so 
as to make possible the achievement of such postwar realists as John 
le Carre and Len Deighton.'' Graham Greene praised him as ``the greatest 
living writer of the novel of suspense'' and called himself one of 
Ambler's disciples. Le Carre, who is 22 years younger than Ambler 
and is best known for his espionage novel ``The Spy Who Came in From 
the Cold,'' called Ambler's novels ``the well into which everybody 
had dipped.'' Ambler's work has withstood the test of time. Julian 
Evans, writing in The Guardian in 1997, called him ``the begetter 
of the modern thriller'' and praised the early Ambler novels for mirroring 
``the queasy atmosphere and conspiratorial politics'' of 1930s Europe. 
Julian Symons, the British crime novelist and critic, wrote in 1994 
that Ambler belonged to the breed of thriller writers ``who charm 
us by the elegance of their prose and their subtlety in dealing with 
places and people.'' Ambler was a fantasy-prone advertising man when 
he began writing his suspense novels in the 1930s. He was a slender 
figure then, with pale blue eyes that have been called hooded and 
with, as he wrote later in a self-mocking moment, ``such a sensitive 
face.'' His books were innovative, as the young author cocksurely 
meant them to be. ``Dorothy Sayers had taken the detective story and 
made it literate,'' he once said. ``Why shouldn't I do the same with 
spies?'' Ambler's heroes were generally more ordinary and believable 
than those of novels of their type written in the preceding years. 
Their technological knowledge was certainly more authoritative, and 
the worlds through which these heroes moved were depicted in a more 
realistic and gritty way. He made his name with ``A Coffin for Dimitrios'' 
and his five other earliest novels, ``The Dark Frontier,'' ``Background 
to Danger,'' ``Cause for Alarm,'' ``Epitaph for a Spy'' and ``Journey 
into Fear.'' All six were published between 1936 and 1940. ``A Coffin 
for Dimitrios'' is about a British writer of detective fiction who 
becomes involved with a Turkish underworld figure called Dimitrios. 
A classic political thriller, it was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection 
in September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, touching off World 
War II. Otto Penzler, an American expert on mystery fiction and thrillers 
who owns the two Mysterious Bookshops, in New York City and Los Angeles, 
has said the book is ``one of the milestones of espionage fiction 
and brought it truly and irrevocably into the modern era.'' ``A Coffin 
for Dimitrios'' has even been called prophetic. Robert D. Kaplan, 
the author of ``Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History,'' wrote 
in The New York Times Book Review in 1993, that for fun, ``and not 
a little insight into the chaos and anarchy now being unleashed in 
the Balkans,'' readers should ``turn to `Coffin for Dimitrios.''' 
Kaplan added: ``Here is a tale of drug smuggling, assassination and 
political intrigue, set in the early part of the century, that perfectly 
captures the atmosphere at the end of the century, as political crime 
networks make their return not just to Bucharest, but even more so 
to Belgrade and other former communist capitals.'' The book's appeal 
to Americans has proven so durable that in 1996 _ six decades after 
it first came out _ a new edition was published by the New York publishers 
Carroll &AMP; Graf. Another of Ambler's thrillers that proved prophetic 
was ``The Dark Frontier,'' which he wrote in 1935. It begins in Britain, 
shifts to Europe and proceeds in Ixania, a fictional Balkan state. 
It has to do with nuclear weaponry, and Ambler, writing about the 
book decades later, said, ``What, it may be asked, was I doing in 
those far-off days using the term `atomic bomb' so familiarly and 
describing the effects of an atomic explosion as if the hideous thing 
already existed?'' ``I lay no claim to special prescience,'' he continued. 
As a student he had read about science, and he recalled that he had 
come to know about the early work of Ernest Rutherford, the British 
physicist who studied atoms, and of other scientists in the field, 
and that he had come to understand some of its implications. Among 
Ambler's other books are ``Judgment on Deltchev'' (1951), ``The Schirmer 
Inheritance'' (1953), ``State of Siege'' (1956), ``Passage of Arms'' 
(1960), ``A Kind of Anger'' (1964), ``The Intercom Conspiracy'' (1969), 
``The Levanter'' (1982) and ``Doctor Frigo'' (1982). In addition to 
his novels, he wrote or collaborated on more than a dozen screenplays 
in Britain and Hollywood between the end of World War II and 1960. 
He was nominated for an Academy Award for his script for ``The Cruel 
Sea'' (1953), and movies were made _ though not not by him _ from 
several of his books, including ``The Light of Day,'' which became 
the successful Jules Dassin film ``Topkapi'' with Peter Ustinov and 
Melina Mercouri in 1964; ``A Coffin for Dimitrios,'' which was made 
into the 1944 movie ``The Mask of Dimitrios'' with Peter Lorre and 
Sydney Greenstreet, and ``Journey Into Fear,'' which became a 1942 
film, under the same title, with Orson Welles as Colonel Haki of the 
Turkish secret police, one of Ambler's most memorable characters. 
Eric Ambler was born on June 28, 1909, in London, the son of Alfred 
Percy Ambler and Amy Madeleine Ambler. His father's many metiers ranged 
from church organist to music hall performer to publicist and brewery 
employee. Young Eric went to Colfe's Grammar School in London, studied 
engineering at London University, found it dull, and left in 1927 
without a degree. Then came a stint with an electrical-equipment company, 
a disappointing stab at show business, early, nonlucrative writing 
of fiction and plays, and some years in advertising, where he began 
as a copywriter and did well before turning full time to the writing 
of thrillers. When Ambler was still a London advertising man in 1934 
he had an odd formative experience. While on a vacation in Marseilles, 
he was cheated out of money playing poker-dice with a larcenous bartender 
and then fantasized about murdering the man with a rifle at a street 
crossing in the city. At that same spot, later that year, a Croatian 
assassin shot and killed King Alexander of Yugoslavia. That coincidence 
spurred Ambler's imagination. In an interview half a century later, 
he recalled: `I felt I had a fresh bit of my character, which was 
an assassin. And I felt there were people all over Europe just like 
me, just ready for the word to kill.'' In his book ``Here Lies: An 
Autobiography,'' which came out in Britain in 1985, he wrote that 
he had cut out news pictures of the site of both the bartender's imagined 
death and the king's actual demise. ``I felt oddly guilty, but also 
pleased,'' he added. ``In the Mediterranean sunshine there were strange 
and violent men with whom I could identify, and with whom, in a way, 
I was now in touch.'' As it happened, Ambler recalled in ``Here Lies,'' 
``the only kind of popular novel about which I had strong feelings'' 
around that time ``was the post-war thriller'' _ that is, the thriller 
as it had been being written since the end of World War I. ``I could 
no longer find any worth a second reading,'' he complained. He felt 
that the villains were unbelievable _ ``power-crazed or coldly sane, 
I no longer believed a word of them.'' Moreover, for Ambler, ``The 
hero did not seem to matter much. He was often only a fugitive, a 
hare to the villain's hounds. He could be a tweedy fellow with steel-gray 
eyes and gun pads on both shoulders or a moneyed dandy with a taste 
for adventure. None of that really mattered.'' Pre-Ambler thrillers 
of that era have also been criticized as lacking a political and atmospheric 
sense of Europe and of the looming prospect of another war. ``As I 
saw it, the thriller had nowhere to go but up,'' Ambler recalled in 
``Here Lies.'' ``I set out to start the upward trend.'' He wrote ``The 
Dark Frontier,'' which got favorable reviews but had many faults, 
he felt. He told a friend, Eileen Bigland, who was a serious author, 
that he had been reading Gogol, Pirandello and James Joyce. She said: 
``Never read very good writers when you are trying yourself to write 
good trash. You'll only get depressed.'' Ambler turned out to be immensely 
skilled at depicting heroes who were unremarkable but appealing people 
enmeshed in sinister situations. As Penzler put it, ``Average people 
behaving bravely, albeit through no desire of their own, as events 
threaten and engulf them is the hallmark of Ambler's thrillers.'' 
In The Guardian in 1972, describing the basic plot that Ambler evolved 
in reshaping the thriller, Thomas Wiseman wrote: ``The villain will 
be as colorful as the hero is colorless, he will be gross and excessive, 
with extreme appetites of one sort or another, while the hero or narrator 
will tend to be abstemious, reserved, unused to firearms or women, 
physically weak, but possessing a native shrewdness, and some special 
knowledge that in the end turns the tables on his most powerful adversary.'' 
Ambler drew on his early training in engineering, and he made engineers 
the heroes of five of his novels: ``Cause for Alarm,'' Journey into 
Fear,'' ``State of Siege,'' ``Passage of Arms'' and ``The Levanter.'' 
It also helped him to write believably about technical matters. His 
vivid characters include Arthur Abdel Simpson, who has been called 
the half-hero of Ambler's novels ``The Light of Day'' and ``Dirty 
Story'' (1967). He is a part-time journalist, minor thief and confidence 
man who says things like ``I have only really been arrested 10 or 
12 times in my whole life.'' Among Ambler's nonheroes are Professor 
Krom in ``The Siege of the Villa Lipp'' (1977), who says, ``What use 
is an honest lawyer when what you need is a dishonest one?'' and Colonel 
Haki, who, on arriving at a house party in a Turkish villa early in 
``A Coffin for Dimitrios,'' ``clicked heels, kissed hands, bowed, 
acknowledged the salutes of the naval officers and ogled the businessmen's 
wives.'' Salted with such figures, the plot of at least one Ambler 
novel has inspired imitation in real life. As Jay Pearsall, owner 
of the two Murder Ink bookstores in New York City, has written, ``After 
seeing `Topkapi' (1964), a film based on Eric Ambler's `The Light 
of Day' (1962), Jack Murphy (aka Murf the Surf) stole the world's 
largest star sapphire, the Star of India, from New York's Museum of 
Natural History.'' During World War II, Ambler served in the British 
army, spent much of the time helping to make training and educational 
films for army use and wrote no novels. Soon after the war, Noel Coward 
urged him to resume his novel writing. ``The admonitory Coward index 
finger wagged under my nose,'' Ambler recalled in ``Here Lies.'' ```Forget 
all this film nonsense,' he said. `Write more books. You think that 
you will always be able to go back to the well. But if you stay away 
too long, there will come a day when you will go back and find the 
well drr-y.''' Ambler collaborated with an Australian writer, Charles 
Rodda, on some thrillers that were published under the pseudonym Eliot 
Reed between 1950 and 1958. But Ambler wrote later that he had only 
contributed substantially to the first two of the five thrillers that 
came out under the Reed pseudonym (``Skytip'' and ``Tender to Danger''). 
Ambler's first novel written under his own name after the war, ``Judgment 
on Deltchev,'' came out in 1951 and followed a British playwright 
sent to a Balkan city to report about a treason trial for a newspaper, 
who then acquires dangerous knowledge. ``The Schirmer Inheritance,'' 
in which a well-born American lawyer hunted in early post-war Europe 
for the heir to an American fortune, followed. During the next 30 
years he wrote 10 more novels. In this second, postwar phase of his 
career, he repeatedly turned to Third World settings involving volatile 
politics, international megacompanies and other forces. ``Passage 
of Arms'' takes place in Asia and involves the finding of a hidden 
store of guerrilla weapons; James M. Cain said it was ``tops for its 
picture of Southeast Asia, in all its color and turmoil.'' ``The Intercom 
Conspiracy,'' published in 1969, is set mainly in Switzerland, where 
Ambler lived for some years, and is about two espionage agents working 
for minor NATO nations. In the early 1970s, he wrote ``The Levanter,'' 
which involves plotting by Palestinians against Israel. That book 
was followed by ``Doctor Frigo,'' in which plotters tried to take 
power in a Caribbean island. Admirers of his last published novel, 
``The Care of Time'' (1981), point to its inviting start: ``The warning 
message arrived on Monday, the bomb itself on Wednesday. It became 
a busy week.'' In 1975, the Mystery Writers of America gave Ambler 
its Grand Master Award. In 1981, Queen Elizabeth II made him an Officer 
of the Order of the British Empire. Ambler's 1939 marriage to Louise 
Crombie, to whom he dedicated ``Journey into Fear,'' ended in divorce 
in May 1958. His second wife was Joan Harrison, a screenwriter and 
film and television producer. She helped write the scripts for ``Foreign 
Correspondent,'' ``Rebecca'' and other films directed by Alfred Hitchcock, 
and she produced the television series ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' 
from 1955 to 1962. She died in 1994. Ambler left no immediate survivors. 
``Thrillers are respectable now,'' Ambler said in a 1981 interview 
with Herbert Mitgang of The New York Times. ``Back in the beginning, 
people weren't quite that sure about them,'' but ``they really say 
more about the way people think and governments behave than many of 
the conventional novels. A hundred years from now, if they last, these 
books may offer some clues to what was going on in our world.''
