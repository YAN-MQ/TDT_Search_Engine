In New York City, about 1,500 people marched down Broadway Thursday 
in a Protest against police brutality. The group known as the October 
22nd coalition to stop police brutality led the rally. The group documents 
allegations of officer misconduct and claims it is a Nationwide problem. 
At first, the city delayed a marching permit, but a judge intervened 
and gave protesters the go-ahead to demonstrate.
