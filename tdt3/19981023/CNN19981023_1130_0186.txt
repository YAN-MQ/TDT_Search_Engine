Last weekend's storms in Texas have now claimed the lives of at least 
29 people. Texas governor George bush and federal emergency management 
director James lee witt are visiting flood-ravaged areas today. 20 
counties have been declared federal disaster areas. Bush wants FEMA 
to add five more counties to the list. Damage is estimated at about 
$400 million. Charles Zewe has more. The Colorado river boiled past 
this antebellum village Thursday, threatening to inundate one-quarter 
of the town 60 miles southwest of houston. Whoa, we gotta a big one 
here. Officials keeping tabs on the river said the Colorado was expected 
to crest Friday at a record level, but below earlier predictions. 
That meant Wharton's business district would stay dry. But in a low-income 
section of town known as "the end," residents who don't have much, 
lost what little they had. Authorities in airboats urged residents 
to leave, as water relentlessly seeped into the neighborhood, flooding 
dozens of homes and an elementary school. Residents here have been 
nervously watching the flood build since torrential rains hit central 
Texas last weekend. They've been devastated. A lot of these folks 
are -- lose a lot of what they own. Within hours, those who failed 
to heed warnings to get out were trapped. I've been here all my life. 
Others, like 4-year-old IRA Mae Anderson, were just stubborn. I want 
to stay here so I be more calmer. Anderson waved off rescuers even 
as flood waters submerged the front steps of her home. Eventually, 
emergency workers brought in the woman's nurse and best friend, bessie, 
who talked her out. And then Anderson, wearing a pink bed coat and 
earmuffs, got her first air boat ride. Why did you decide to come 
out now? She said she would kill me if I hadn't. Are you glad you 
came out then? Yeah, I'm tired of worrying Y'all. There you go. Anderson 
will stay with friends until the flood recedes. Like her neighbors, 
she's unsure what she'll find when she goes home again. Officials 
say that probably won't happen for several days. Charles Zewe, CNN, 
Wharton, Texas.
