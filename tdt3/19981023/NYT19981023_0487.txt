Gary Franks, the Republican seeking to unseat Sen. Christopher Dodd, 
used their opening debate Friday night to scold Connecticut's senior 
senator repeatedly, accusing him of missing crucial votes and paying 
more attention to Hollywood than to the home crowd. Dodd, a former 
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, disputed few of the 
accusations, but instead responded placidly and with occasional humor, 
stressing accomplishments like his sponsorship of the Family Medical 
Leave Act, which allows workers to take time off without pay to care 
for a sick child or family member. Franks brought up the DNC _ the 
issue his staff calls ``the bomb'' because of the associated campaign 
fund-raising controversies _ when he noted that Dodd had served 24 
years in the House or Senate without serving as ranking member or 
chairman of a committee. Franks, said, ``The only thing he headed 
was a party, and that doesn't count, as far as I'm concerned.'' He 
added that Connecticut was not receiving its fair share of federal 
funds. ``Wake up!'' he told Dodd at one point. ``We need these dollars.'' 
Franks went on, ``You can't explain this away, Chris. You've missed 
so many votes, you don't show up, you've stayed away from the state 
90 consecutive weekends _ 90 consecutive weekends. How are you supposed 
to be in touch with the people of Connecticut?'' Dodd said he believed 
he had delivered for the people of Connecticut, and said he would 
leave it up to them to decide if he had enough clout. ``It's not just 
the chair you sit in,'' he said, ``it's what you do in the chair you're 
in.'' He then joked that, in view of some of the budget cuts Franks 
supported when he was in Congress, he wished that Franks had missed 
a few more votes than he did. Dodd said he had a voting record of 
98 percent for the last six years, and 95 percent for his 18 years 
in the Senate. The debate, held in a renovated theater now called 
the Garde Arts Center, was sponsored by The Day of New London and 
the League of Women Voters of Connecticut. Franks referred over and 
over to Dodd as ``Chris,'' while the senator consistently referred 
to Franks as ``my opponent.'' The format was loose, allowing the candidates 
to decide how many rebuttals they wanted to take. At one point, when 
the moderator asked if he wanted to respond to one of Franks' fusillades, 
Dodd suppressed his apparent annoyance and said, ``Why don't you just 
move along?'' When asked about campaign financing, Franks said 75 
to 85 percent of his contributors were from Connecticut, a statement 
he said his opponent could not make. ``Most of his dollars are coming 
from New York City, Washington, D.C., and California _ the Hollywood, 
Beltway, Broadway candidate,'' Franks said. Dodd responded that he 
had received donations from 8,000 individuals, half of which were 
for $100 or less. ``I also believe that my strongest support has come 
from small donors.'' ``He's being far too modest,'' Franks cut in, 
``because he's one of the leaders of the PAC.'' In Franks' closing 
statement, he referred to his status as a Republican who is black. 
``There are some people out there who are of color who may have never 
voted for a Republican, and there are some white people out there 
who may have never voted for a black individual,'' he said. ``I know 
that in this great state of ours, that's not an impediment, it's just 
an interesting little twist. And I also know that when all is said 
and done, when you look at my record versus my opponent, what I plan 
to do for Connecticut and for your families, you will see a distinct 
difference.'' Dodd used his closing statement to thank the state's 
voters for the chance to serve. ``We talk a lot about our records 
and so forth,'' he said. ``I think people in an election want to know 
what you're for, as well _ what your plans are for the future. I think 
we need to keep our economy on a steady foot: a good fiscal policy. 
We need to improve our educational system. I mentioned health care 
as a critical issue. I'd like to see us do better with transportation 
and privacy. We're about to have the last election of the 20th century, 
and I think we need to prepare well for that 21st century.'' The candidates' 
second and final debate will be held Thursday in Farmington, west 
of Hartford.
