Well, New Yorkers are making plans to celebrate the victory of the 
New York Yankees over the San Diego Padres, a major league baseball's 
World Series. VOA's Martin Bush reports. The New York Yankees swept 
the San Diego Padres in four straight games to win major league baseball's 
World Series. And on Friday, the players will reap their tumultuous 
reward. They'll be honored by a parade of the so-called concrete canyons 
of lower Broadway, the same route traveled by past heroes. New York's 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will lead the celebration. It'll come up the 
Canyon of Heroes and then there'll be a ceremony. This ceremony will 
be at City Hall Park. The most valuable player in the 1998 World Series 
was the Yankee's Scott Broshus, who led the team in hits and belted 
two key home runs. SCOTT broshus, 1998 world series' most I look forward 
to going back and going on that parade. This is the second baseball 
championship the Yankees have won since 1996 and the 24th in their 
history. Martin Bush, VOA News, New York.
