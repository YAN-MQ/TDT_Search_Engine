The weather around the country continues to make news. In Texas, the 
death toll is 29. You saw governor bush flying over some of the hardest-hit 
areas today. 25 separate counties have been declared disaster areas 
in the state. And speaking of the weather-making news, there's a brand-new 
tropical storm out there. Without further delay, let's go to WNBC-TV 
in New York, meteorologist janice huff. What a fabulous beginning. 
We'll go right into it. I didn't say its name was Mitch, though. But 
you just did. Tropical storm Mitch. South of Jamaica, about 335 miles, 
a storm not posing any threat to land right now because it's remaining 
in the same position it basically was in yesterday at this time. We're 
watch ig it to see if it starts to move. Very little bad weather to 
talk about around the nation. Some isolated showers over the Rockies, 
parts of Oklahoma, otherwise quiet. Here are the temperatures. Nice 
and mild over California, 60's, 70ings, 80 in southern Arizona. It 
was down to 29 degrees this morning in Raleigh, North Carolina, this 
morning. Back down to the 30's across the southern appellations, places 
like atlanta. High temperatures tomorrow, 50's in the pacific northwest. 
70's as far north as Bismarck, North Dakota. 69 in Minneapolis and 
Chicago, 70's in Boston, Washington, Atlanta, 80 in miami, sunshine 
up and down the east coast. Showers expected in Seattle tomorrow. 
Phoenix a high of 89 degrees. Den venn warms up to 68. A high of 74 
zegrees in Dallas. Most of the nation looking pretty good and rather 
quiet. The jet stream, as we go into Monday, a basic warm-up for the 
entire nation, and then it's time to fall back. Remember this weekend 
is when we turn our clocks back one hour, back to standard time. So, 
at 2:00 A.M. on Sunday, hopefully you've turned all those clocks back 
in the house. You know, on the V.C.R., on the wall, on the TV. Don't 
forget to turn all the clocks back one hour. That's before you go 
to bed on Saturday night. Brian, have that list all checked off. It's 
always 12 noon on the V.C.R. thank you very much.
