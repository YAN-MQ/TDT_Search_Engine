Halloween, the traditional holiday for haunting is still a couple 
of weeks away. But it appeases a restless spirit at a church in France 
has gotten off to an early start. Townspeople in the village of Dilant 
say they saw vases explode and candlesticks soar through the air during 
preparations for a concert earlier this week. Witnesses say moving 
the church's alter a few inches seem to trigger the flotation and 
explosion of holy objects. They promptly called the police, then an 
exorcist at the archdiocese of Ben Salam who held a prayer session 
at the church. The mayor of the tiny village says is not normally 
interested in the supernatural, but he also does not believe the strange 
could have been carried out by children getting ready for Halloween. 
He says they would have to be pretty talented to do such a thing.
