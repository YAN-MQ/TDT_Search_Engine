President Clinton has decided he will not pay a courtesy visit to 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahati Mohammed at the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Forum in Malaysia next month. The President would normally 
pay such a visit to the leader of the host country, but an American 
official has said Mr. Clinton will skip the gesture at this year's 
APEC meeting to demonstrate U.S. concerns about recent political repression 
in Malaysia. He said the president will take part in the group discussions. 
Officials said the decision is due to the jailing of former deputy 
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim who has accused police of beating him. 
Mr. Mahatir fired Mr. Anwar last month during a dispute over economic 
policy. Mr. Anwar has since been charged with corruption and sexual 
misconduct. He denies any wrongdoing.
