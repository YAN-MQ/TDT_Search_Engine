Russia has objected to a draft U.N. resolution on Kosovo that would 
increase pressure on Yugoslavia to comply with terms of the Kosovo 
peace agreement. Russia is mainly concerned the resolution would allow 
NATO and the organization for security in cooperation in Europe to 
use force to carry out their monitoring missions. U.N. Security Council 
President Jeremy Greenstock says although good progress has been made, 
it is not ready for adoption. A vote could come as early as today, 
after further discussions in the Security Council.
