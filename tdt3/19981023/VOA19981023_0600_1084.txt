A U.S. pathologist says Olympic Gold Medalist Florence Griffith Joyner 
died of suffocation, while having an epileptic seizure. The autopsy 
results were made public in Santa Ana, California on Thursday, one 
month after the champion runner, known as Flo- Jo, suddenly died in 
her sleep at age 38. The report said the seizure was brought on by 
a brain abnormality. Dr. Richard Fukimoto said nothing unusual, in 
terms of drugs, was discovered in the athlete's body. She was face 
down on this pillow and the bedding around with -- with half limited 
the amount of air or oxygen available to her. And as a result, she 
essentially, in laymen's term, closed suffocated to her death. Mrs. 
Griffith Joyner won three gold medals at the 1988 Olympic Games in 
Seoul, South Korea. The report is expected to help quell speculation 
that Mrs. Griffith Joyner may have used steroids to enhance her performance 
and that this might have damaged her heart.
