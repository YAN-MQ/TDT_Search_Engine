There are only 171 named varieties of miniature daffodils, a small 
number in the enormous world of 13,000 narcissus hybrids, any one 
of which _ and billions are sold _ can safely be given sole responsibility 
for trumpeting the arrival of spring. Big daffodils make a big splash 
in the garden, but the miniature varieties hold the corner on charm. 
These enchanting little flowers are the darlings of every gardener 
who grows them. The miniatures are the toy poodles among daffodils, 
perfect tiny representations of the big standards. They usually grow 
on short stems, up to about eight inches tall, but some grow a foot 
tall and flash their perfectly proportioned blooms right up under 
the chins of standard daffodils. The genus Narcissus is split into 
12 numbered divisions, based broadly on the size of the trumpet (called 
the corona or the cup in daffodil circles) and on the size and arrangement 
of the petals (the perianth segments). Miniature daffodils may come 
from any division, and there are minis registered in nearly every 
one. So far, there are no miniatures in the split-corona division 
(11), whose members have frilly, splayed trumpets, and none in the 
late-blooming group of fragrant, snow-white daffodils with tiny bright 
cups, the division known as the ``poets'' (9). Delia Bankhead grows 
nearly all of the available miniatures in her one-acre garden in Hendersonville, 
N.C. Daffodil experts refer earnestly to an affliction they call yellow 
fever, and Mrs. Bankhead came down with a bad case about 25 years 
ago. ``It's the collector's mania,'' she said recently. ``When you 
start collecting a certain type of thing, then you want all the best 
of them.'' Mrs. Bankhead is the chairwoman of the American Daffodil 
Society's committee on miniatures, which maintains the official list 
of miniature daffodils. She sells a few bulbs on the side, too. Her 
catalog of miniatures, which usually lists about 50 varieties, is 
mailed in May, and the bulbs sell out in two weeks, she says. ``One 
of the great qualities of miniature daffodils is that of grace,'' 
Mrs. Bankhead said. She particularly likes miniatures in Divisions 
5 and 6, both of which have wonderful swept-back petals. ``The way 
they hold themselves, the fly-back petals, the pendant pose, they 
just look extremely graceful, like a tiny little ballet dancer,'' 
she said. At most garden shops, miniature daffodils are up on the 
top shelf, in bins not much bigger than a shoebox. The fist-size bulbs 
in big wooden crates using up all the best display space are the large 
yellow daffodils, usually Unsurpassable or Dutch Master, though they're 
sometimes labeled ``King Alfred type'' out of respect for the best-known 
but now retired monarch of yellow trumpets. You have to be on your 
toes to spot the miniatures like Hawera, Minnow and Tete-a-Tete. ``The 
first time I saw miniature daffodils in a show, I was fascinated that 
there were daffodils this small, and I started looking for people 
with some for sale,'' said Mary Lou Gripshover, who has grown daffodils 
for 30 years and has about 70 species and varieties of miniature, 
including some of her own as-yet unregistered seedlings, in her garden 
in Milford, Ohio. ``I started doing a little bit of breeding, looking 
for something new and different, something that looks really cute.'' 
Her Three of Diamonds, pure white with an orange rim around the cup, 
fits the description. It was introduced to the market in 1993 and 
is still hard to find and quite expensive ($25 a bulb from one supplier), 
but as any real plant collector can tell you, $25 is cheap for a plant 
you love. Many miniatures cost much less, however. Midget, Quince, 
Baby Moon, Jumblie, W.P. Milner and other small daffodils can be had 
for less than a dollar a bulb. For between $2 and $10 apiece, blue-ribbon 
miniature daffodils like Segovia, Xit, and Yellow Xit are simply indescribably 
sweet in the garden. Flower show judges will be bowled over. At any 
price, Mrs. Gripshover's advice is: plant lots. ``One bulb doesn't 
really do,'' she said. ``You need a dozen or more.'' Many of the miniatures 
on the American Daffodil Society's list were bred over half a century, 
beginning in 1929, by Alec Gray, a prolific English hybridizer considered 
the dean of miniature daffodils, and by an American, Roberta Watrous, 
now retired from growing, who hybridized miniatures near Washington. 
The society's miniature committee has added 29 daffodils to its list 
in the last three years. ``In the last five or six years, there has 
been a great resurgence of interest in breeding miniatures, worldwide 
really, but the fruits are still to come,'' Mrs. Bankhead said. ``I 
know at least 10 American amateurs who are actively breeding minis.'' 
Hybridizers in England, Australia and New Zealand are working on them, 
too. The bulbs from Down Under have to relearn the seasons before 
they bloom reliably in the Northern Hemisphere's spring. It takes 
a couple of years. Plant these little jewels now, and place them where 
you can see them, at the front of a flower bed, along a walk, near 
the front porch. They sparkle among ground-cover plants. Plant them 
about four inches deep, and water well after planting. Then stand 
back, but not too far back.
