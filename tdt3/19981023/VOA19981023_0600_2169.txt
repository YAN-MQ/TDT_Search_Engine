Next, one of the former top members of Oum Supreme Truth Cult blamed 
for the deadly 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system 
has been sentenced to death. As Steve Herman reports from Tokyo, 38-year-old 
Kazu Kaki Okazaka was convicted of other murders blamed on the cult, 
not the gas attack. This is the first time that a Tokyo district court 
has handed down a capital punishment sentence in connection with the 
Oum cult's activities. Judges rejected a plea from Okazaki's lawyers 
for leniency, saying that his actions were especially brutal. Okazaki 
and four other cult members, according to police, followed orders 
of Oum founder Shakawasahara and strangle a lawyer, his wife and infant 
son in 1989. The attorney has been helping his family who's children 
and other relatives had joined the cult. The bodies of the family 
of lawyer Kinsumi Sakimoto were found buried in the remote mountains 
of Central Japan six years later, when a full investigation of the 
cult was launched after the Tokyo subway nerve gas attacks. Okazaki 
was also condemned to death for his role in the killing of a cult 
member who tried to leave the group also in 1989. That victim, Shuji 
Paguchi was strangled with a rope. Okazaki who left Oum Supreme Truth 
the year after the murders had first denied any involvement in the 
killings, but late confessed. Legal proceedings involving the gas 
attacks and other alleged criminal activities by the organization, 
which is still in operation, are expected to drag on for years. Steve 
Herman for VOA News, Tokyo.
