Bizarre story out of the American south this week involving crime 
and politics. Earlier this week in Tennessee, a popular state senator 
facing re-election next month was found murdered, shot point blank 
in the head. He was a strong advocate of crime victims' rights, among 
other things. He had never missed a day of work in his 28-year career. 
Now police have arrested the senator's political challenger, unusual 
local character, the property assessor, who legally changed his middle 
name a Short time ago to "low-tax." Here is NBC's fredricka Whitfield. 
In cookeville, Tennessee, a day of sadness and shock. Days after the 
town buries well-liked state senator Tommy burks, found murdered on 
his hog farm earlier in the week, another stunning blow. Burks' political 
opponent, Byron looper, is arrested and charged with the incumbent's 
murder. Loopers' co-workers say there must be a mistake. I think he's 
an honest man, generous. I think he's innocent. What he's accused 
of is not the Byron looper I know. But authorities say looper, a republican 
viing to unseat burks in the november election, may have had two sides. 
We've been very careful to not take charges that we didn't feel were 
substantiated. Police got suspicious when they say looper turned up 
missing, hadn't been seen stins hours before burks' murder on Monday. 
All week, townspeople themselves startsed taking notice, reflecting 
on what they called looper's unusual political behavior in recent 
years, indicted this year for theft and misuse of office. Unique delusions 
of grandeur. He thought very highly of himself. And he basically became 
a local joke around here. But today, no one was laughing. This case 
is a type of a case that comes along every once in a while that strikes 
at the very heart of our system. Today supporters of burks, a respecteded 
legislator for 28 years, campaigned for his widow, Charlotte, to fill 
his seat. I think she's the proper person. A stroong advocate of victims' 
rights, two of his initiatives will still appear on the election ballot. 
Looper will be arraigned next week. Fredricka Whitfield, NBC news, 
cookeville, Tennessee.
