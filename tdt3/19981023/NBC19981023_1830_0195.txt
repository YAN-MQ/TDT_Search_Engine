As part of the deal, President Clinton has agreed to go to the Middle 
East to address a Palestinian conference, where significant changes 
will be made in the Palestinian charter, all part of the agreement. 
Tonight NBC's Andrea Mitchell on the details of the deal. Like everything 
else in the Middle East, it was anything but easy. Nine nonstop days 
and nights, including 90 hours involving the president and a final 
push from Jordan's ailing king Hussein. 7:00 A.M., the deal is done. 
Handshakes all around. Yasser Arafat leaves to get ready for the signing 
ceremony. Marine one gets ready to take the president back to the 
White House. Israeli officials even talk about how good a deal it 
is. This takes Israelis and Palestinians closer to achieving peace 
with security. Suddenly 8:00 A.M., Netanyahu takes Clinton aside. 
U.S. officials say for the first time, he says he won't sign the deal 
unless the president first releases Israeli spy Jonathan pollard, 
convicted of stealing U.S. military secrets for Israel. He clearly 
thought it would help him placate his own critics from the right, 
and he clearly thought that a weakened Bill Clinton might be in a 
Position that he'd have to go along with it. Aides say the president 
is shocked. He has twice denied Clemency for pollard. For six hours 
they argue. Finally Clinton says he will review the pollard case. 
The summit deal is back on. The key to the deal -- timing. Israel 
will release 750 Palestinian prisoners and turn over land in stages, 
but only after the Palestinians deliver their part of the bargain. 
They must -- cancel their 35-year-old threat to destroy Israel, stop 
releasing suspected terrorists, collect outlawed weapons, reduce the 
size of their police force. All to be monitored by the CIA. A dangerous 
role for America. I would very much hope that they wouldn't be blamed 
if this one doesn't work. But I'm afraid they might be. And after 
a week of arguments, the leaders trust each other even less than before. 
While back home, extremists on both sides are already threatening 
violence certain to blow up the deal. Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, Washington.
