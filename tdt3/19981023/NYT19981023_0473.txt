Frustrated by what he called a lack of attention to his gubernatorial 
campaign, Peter Vallone said Friday that the public should be taking 
his proposals more seriously and pressuring Gov. George Pataki to 
debate him. In an hourlong interview with editors and reporters at 
The New York Times, Vallone, who is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee 
and the speaker of the New York City Council, spent considerably more 
time lashing out at Pataki than discussing his own platform. He angrily 
questioned why the Republican governor had remained popular despite 
increasing the state's debt, vetoing spending on education and failing 
to reform the state's campaign finance system. Vallone said he was 
especially annoyed that Pataki had treated him as if he were invisible, 
refusing to debate him or even to acknowledge Vallone's questions 
about his record. The speaker has repeatedly demanded debates, but 
the governor has refused to be pinned down, saying only that it was 
up to his campaign staff to arrange debates. ``Folks, what I'm saying 
here is, do you realize what's going on?'' the normally placid Vallone 
said, raising his voice. ``Do you have any conception that you have 
a governor in office that no one knows anything about, that doesn't 
stand still long enough to be questioned, that refuses to debate?'' 
He added: ``The best way I can describe it would be, I think George 
Pataki is a hologram. He's there, but he's not there.'' Although Vallone 
easily won the Democratic primary last month, he spent most of the 
$5.7 million he has raised on that effort, and has struggled in recent 
weeks to get his message out across the state. Pataki, who is popular 
and much better known than Vallone, has raised nearly $20 million 
for his re-election campaign and invested much of it in television 
advertising. Vallone, who recently shepherded legislation through 
the council that would discourage city candidates from accepting donations 
from corporations, questioned why Pataki had not moved to limit the 
amount statewide candidates could spend on campaigns. He suggested 
that Pataki and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, another Republican seeking re-election, 
were not only raising millions of dollars for their campaigns, but 
were intimidating potential donors into withholding donations to Democratic 
candidates. In an interview with Times reporters and editors last 
week, Pataki said that he found the state's campaign financing system 
``dreadful,'' but added that he had not come up with a plan to change 
it. ``Do you have any realization about the accumulation of funds 
that is taking place in the Pataki-D'Amato machine?'' Vallone said. 
``Do you have any idea of why so many people are giving to that campaign 
and are afraid to give to any other campaign?'' Vallone said that 
as governor, he would create thousands of jobs by passing a law that 
would encourage state and local government to hire and purchase goods 
from New York state firms. New York City has such a law, he said, 
and it keeps the city from losing jobs and contracts to New Jersey 
or Connecticut. A similar bill reached Pataki's desk last year, but 
he vetoed it because he feared other states would retaliate by refusing 
to hire laborers from New York, Vallone said. Such a law would create 
at least 40,000 jobs each year, Vallone said. ``I wouldn't mind if 
we were No. 1, but we're No. 47 out of 48 in job creation,'' Vallone 
said. ``That's a substantive issue. Should he not be coming forward 
and talking about this?'' Vallone also proposed eliminating managed 
care and private insurance companies, which he said have too steep 
profit margins and spend too much on administrative costs. He would 
replace them with a state-run health care system, using money from 
the state's anticipated settlement with tobacco companies to provide 
health insurance to the working poor and to reduce the state's Medicaid 
burden. ``What I'm trying to get across here is, I've come up with 
some very substantive proposed plans for job creation, for health 
care and for education,'' Vallone said. ``I have put forth issues 
which I think are very, very important. That's the only reason I'm 
running, is that I believe that this state is crying out for reform.'' 
Hinting at his frustration with press coverage of his campaign, he 
added:, ``I've had major press conferences. If you choose not to cover 
it, that's different. But I had major press conferences on every one 
of these situations.'' Vallone seemed stung because Pataki had not 
used the City Council's campaign finance legislation as a model for 
campaign finance reform at the state level. The legislation is not 
yet in effect _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani vetoed it last month, and the 
council just overrode the veto Thursday _ but Vallone said that ``most 
people in the entire nation have already copied, or at least asked 
me about'' the package. But throughout the interview, Vallone appeared 
the most irritated about Pataki's refusal to debate him. He returned 
to the subject numerous times, asking why the news media and the voters 
were not angry, too. ``No one should have the right to tell the people 
of this city or the people of this state, `I choose not to debate,''' 
Vallone said. ``If I'm choosing to put myself out there as a citywide 
or a statewide candidate, this man, this governor, should sit down 
and debate. Where is the outrage?''
