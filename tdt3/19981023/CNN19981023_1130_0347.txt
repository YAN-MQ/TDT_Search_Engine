A commission is recommending health care professionals be tested and 
reviewed years after they're certified. The Pew health professions 
commission says current measures do not adequately protect consumers 
from medical incompetence. While some states require continuing education, 
none require additional competency tests. The commission says constantly 
developing technology makes it crucial for those in the medical profession 
to remain informed.
