The results of the autopsy on Florence Griffith Joyner were released 
thursday. The orange county, California coroner's office lists suffocation 
as the cause of death. The report says Griffith Joyner had an epileptic 
seizure in her sleep and her position in bed caused her to suffocate. 
When the three time Olympic gold medalist died last month, some people 
raised questions of steroid use. But the coroner's report shows only 
two common, over-the-counter drugs were in her system.
