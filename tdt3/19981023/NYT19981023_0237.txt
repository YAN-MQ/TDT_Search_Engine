The patient, a slave named Luke, has died. The doctor turns to the 
devastated young mistress of the house and tells her he'll send the 
bill to Cole &AMP; Sons. ``It is a commercial loss, is it not?'' he 
says. This doctor is, despite that comment, one of the good Britons, 
an abolitionist filled with guilt and pessimism. ``I believe that 
slavery will be ended soon,'' he says, ``but the cruelty we have learned 
will poison us forever.'' In ``A Respectable Trade,'' a remarkable 
two-part ``Mobil Masterpiece Theater'' production beginning Sunday 
night, almost every character is sympathetically, painfully human. 
The film, set in Bristol, England, in 1788, is the love story of a 
married white woman and her black slave, but its observations are 
much larger. The telling exchanges of ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' (among 
class-conscious whites as well as between races) and the under-your-skin 
identification with suffering of ``Schindler's List'' are a powerful 
combination. Is it rude, for instance, for a gentleman to refuse a 
guest's request for after-dinner sex with one of the host's slaves? 
Is it really the responsibility of the lady of the house to choose 
and fetch the woman? And how does one go about ignoring the anguish 
on the chosen woman's face? ``A Respectable Trade'' is, first, the 
story of Frances Scott (Emma Fielding), an unmarried woman who has 
lost her governess job and is not wanted in the home of her high-born 
uncle and aunt. When she receives a marriage proposal by mail from 
a stranger (in response to a job-search letter), she decides to accept, 
although the man, Josiah Cole (Warren Clarke), is much older, socially 
backward and shocked to hear that there were once Romans in Britain. 
And he's a slave trader. Frances accepts her fate so cheerfully and 
with such good manners that we, the viewers, try to accept Josiah, 
too, and root for his innocent efforts to move up Bristol's social 
ladder. One of Josiah's plans is for Frances to teach English and 
``civility'' to a small group of African slaves so that they can be 
sold as house servants. Within this group, there is something special 
about the man she names Moses (Ariyon Bakare). She soon learns that 
his real name is Mehuru, that he was trained as a priest in the kingdom 
of Yoruba and that he is the smart, sensitive, witty gentleman she 
has always wanted to meet. He is everything that her husband is not. 
The mutual attraction is evident to every black person in the household 
(although apparently invisible to the whites) and eventually consummated. 
From that point on, the story turns into an almost routine romance 
but its intelligence never flags. Ms. Fielding, a London stage actress, 
is spectacular from beginning to end. Bakare is powerful, Clarke is 
endearing, and Anna Massey brings enormous authority to the role of 
Josiah's stern spinster sister who thinks all this social climbing 
is foolishness. Philippa Gregory, who wrote the screenplay and the 
1995 novel on which it is based, and Suri Krishnamma, the director, 
have made a gripping and oddly, darkly charming film about the clash 
of old dignity, fresh horror and the consciences of men and women 
whom we sometimes excuse as being ``of their time.'' PRODUCTION NOTES:
