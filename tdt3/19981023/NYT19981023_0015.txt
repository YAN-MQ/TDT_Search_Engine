Ormonde de Kay, a writer, poet and magazine editor, died on Oct. 2 
at Beth Israel Hospital. De Kay, who lived in Manhattan, was 74. He 
died of lung cancer, his brother George said. De Kay was a versatile 
writer who took delight in wordplay and language. He wrote dozens 
of documentaries, contributed to the script of the highly praised 
1949 film ``Lost Boundaries,'' wrote several books that combined his 
affection for light verse and French, and was the author of children's 
biographies of Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt and Lewis and Clark. 
He wrote articles on history for magazines like American Heritage 
and Horizon, where he was articles editor in the 1970s, and he contributed 
light verse to The New Yorker, Harper's and The Atlantic Monthly. 
His ``Rimes de la Mere Oie,'' a 1971 translation of Mother Goose that 
managed to retain the meter, rhyme schemes and humor of the English 
originals, was praised by Robert Graves as ``a remarkable achievement 
and a great gift to the French.'' In the 1980s and '90s, de Kay turned 
full time to freelance writing. His last book, ``From the Age That 
Is Past,'' published in 1994, is a history of the Harvard Club of 
New York. De Kay, who was born in New York City in 1923, graduated 
in 1945 from Harvard College, where he was the editor of the university 
literary magazine The Advocate. During World War II and the Korean 
War he served aboard Navy destroyer escorts. In the late 1940s and 
'50s he lived in Paris, London, Munich and Rome, writing radio and 
film scripts. Later he helped to start Interplay, a magazine about 
international affairs. De Kay is survived by his wife, Barbara; a 
son, Thomas, of Manhattan; two brothers, George, of Manhattan and 
James Tertius of Stonington, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Lenore Roosevelt 
of Cudjo Key, Fla.; and a stepson, Philip Roosevelt of Chappaqua, 
N.Y.
