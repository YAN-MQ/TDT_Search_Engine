Fisher price and the consumer product safety commission are carrying 
out one of the largest recalls ever. Up to 10 million of Fisher price's 
child-sized power wheels toys are subject to a voluntary recall because 
of a significant risk of fire. The recall covers the Barbie Jeep, 
the big Jake and the extreme machine. The battery-operated vehicles 
have caused 150 fires. Nine children have suffered minor Burns. Our 
experience is that it has been a very minor problem, but any fire 
is serious to us, obviously, any injury to a child. The reality is 
of the 4 million vehicles we have sold since 1994, only 0.0001% has 
been affected by this problem. If you have questions, a toll-free 
hot line is available. The number is 1-800-977-7800.
