H. Richard Nesson, the former president of Brigham and Women's Hospital, 
one of the nation's leading teaching hospitals, and a pioneer in hospital 
management in the new era of health maintenance organizations, died 
Oct. 18 in Boston. He was 66. Nesson suffered a heart attack while 
exercising, said the hospital's current president, Jeffrey Otten. 
Though retired from Brigham and Women's since 1997, Nesson remained 
a high-profile figure in Boston health care until his death. Last 
week, for example, he announced the creation of a program at a health 
center to give women without health insurance access to cancer tests. 
A Boston native who came to view health care as a basic right, Nesson 
got his bachelor of science degree from Harvard College in 1954 and 
completed his medical studies at Boston University where he graduated 
cum laude in 1959. Nesson, who was a specialist in kidney care, never 
practiced medicine privately. He taught internal medicine at the Harvard 
Medical School, but by the early 1980s it had become obvious that 
his true vocation lay in building and managing an increasingly complex 
health care system. ``He was one of the first people in the country 
to argue that HMOs might actually provide better care at lower cost,'' 
Otten said. In 1982, Nesson became president of Peter Bent Brigham 
Hospital. Medical research expanded rapidly during Nesson's 15-year 
presidency, which saw a nearly twenty-fold increase in federal financing, 
to $180 million. Nesson presided over the merger of longtime rivals 
Brigham and Women's and the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1993. 
The Harvard Community Health Plan, by then the largest managed care 
organization in the state, sent most of its inpatients there. He served 
in public service posts, including chairman of the Massachusetts Hospital 
Association, a director of the Massachusetts United Way and chairman 
of the Harvard Medical Center AIDS Committee. Nesson is survived by 
his wife, Lois; two children, Ted and Sara; two sisters, Marilyn Mann 
of Gloucester, Mass., and Lois Cohen of Glencoe, Ill.; and two grandchildren.
