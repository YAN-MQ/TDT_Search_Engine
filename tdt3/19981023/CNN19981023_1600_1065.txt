Dole food company can't make lemonade from these lemons. Shares of 
Dole dropped nearly 14% after the company warned of an earnings shortfall. 
The world's largest Grower and harvester of fresh produce said storms 
caused by El Nino initially destroyed the Latin American banana crop. 
Prices then plummeted after a post storm bumper crop resulted in a 
surplus. The company said disposing of all the surplus fruit will 
hurt profits for the quarter. Dole finishing the day down 5 1/14678 
a 14% drop.
