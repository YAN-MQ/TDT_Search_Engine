The Middle East peace agreement gives the CIA a new and potentially 
risky role in safeguarding security for Israel and the Palestinian 
Authority. The pact empowers intelligence operatives to referee disputes 
involving the handling of suspected terrorists, to monitor who is 
arrested and jailed by Israeli and Palestinian authorities and to 
help establish sophisticated and reliable border checkpoints. While 
the CIA has quietly been performing many of these tasks for the last 
three years, Friday's accord brings those covert activities in from 
the cold and thrusts the CIA into the center of the Middle East peace 
effort, making the CIA responsible for monitoring and verifying the 
toughest provisions of the agreement. The CIA's ability to win the 
confidence of both sides by monitoring West Bank security issues in 
recent years was credited with helping to open the door to the broader 
agreement, a point that President Clinton acknowledged Friday when 
he noted that George Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, 
``had an unusual, almost unprecedented role to play because of the 
security considerations.'' While broadening the agency's mission and 
influence in the Middle East, the public role of the CIA in the region 
carries significant new opportunities and risks. ``It's entirely appropriate 
to use our intelligence assets to promote stability and peace in the 
world,'' said David Boren, a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. ``We're going to see a lot more use of the CIA to get the 
cooperation of other nations in multilateral actions to preserve peace.'' 
But some intelligence officials fear the heightened visibility of 
CIA operatives could compromise their sources and methods, and perhaps 
even their safety. The agency could also get bogged down in political 
crossfire that it has been able to dodge by working in the shadows. 
R. James Woolsey, who was Clinton's first director of Central Intelligence, 
said Friday, ``I feel far more positively about the substance of what 
the agency is doing than the fact it's becoming public.'' Some policy-makers 
might be more tempted to meddle with the agency's primary responsibility 
to collect intelligence and provide unbiased assessments, Woolsey 
said. And there is a danger, some officials say, of the CIA's associating 
too closely with the Palestinian intelligence service, whose agents 
are not in the habit of extracting information without extracting 
fingernails. ``Enmeshing the CIA in this is a serious, serious mistake,'' 
said Dov Zakheim, a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan administration. 
``The CIA is essentially getting involved as an umpire. If anything 
goes wrong in the Middle East, guess who gets blamed? The umpire.'' 
Intelligence officials said this week that Tenet has been trying to 
deepen the CIA's role in building trust between the Shin Bet, the 
Israeli internal security service and the Palestinian security service. 
For the last two years, the CIA's station chief in Israel has been 
acting as a go-between and sharing U.S. intelligence with the Israelis 
and the Palestinians. The station chief's last assignment was as the 
CIA's liaison to Congress, a good training ground for impossible confrontational 
situations. Boren, whose staff director for the intelligence committee 
was Tenet, said the benefits of the CIA's new role outweighed the 
risks. ``There's a tradeoff in giving up some protection of our intelligence 
source, methods and technical means, but I think it's worth it to 
obtain the greater good,'' said Boren. ``Those who are opposed are 
locked into a Cold War mode of thinking.''
