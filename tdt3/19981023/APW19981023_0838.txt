Parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis Friday berated the United 
Nations and its secretary general for discriminating against some 
countries. Greece has in the past criticized the Security Council 
for failing to implement more than one dozen U.N. resolutions calling 
for a solution to the Cyprus problem. In a letter sent to Secretary 
General Kofi Annan for Saturday's commemoration of the organization's 
53rd anniversary, Kaklamanis called on the U.N. to respect its charter. 
``In the cases where the strategic interests of some powerful members 
_ mainly the United States _ demand it, we have noted an inordinate 
amount of zeal in the implementation of U.N. decisions,'' Kaklamanis 
said. The eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been divided 
since 1974, when Turkey invaded and occupied its northern third. U.N.-sponsored 
talks to reunify the island have been deadlocked since 1997. Kaklamanis 
added that ``decisions should be implemented without discrimination 
among member states, large or small.'' Athens is still stinging over 
its failure to win a non-permanent seat on the Security Council earlier 
this month. Kaklamanis, a member of the governing socialist party, 
has criticized both the U.N. and U.S. in the past. Earlier this year 
he accused U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns of acting like an ``anthippatos,'' 
which in ancient Greek was used to describe a deputy governor of Imperial 
Rome.
