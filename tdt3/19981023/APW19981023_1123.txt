The two world-class swimmers who charged performance-enhancing drugs 
were rife throughout the sport expressed dismay Friday at German officials' 
lack of action after a special hearing. German swim and sports officials 
questioned Chris-Carol Bremer and Mark Warnecke for three hours about 
their claims last week that EPO and testosterone were in widespread 
use in the sport. But following the hastily called meeting, the officials 
declined to commit themselves to specific action, expressed doubts 
about the swimmers' claims or said they should have named names. ``I'm 
disappointed. I wish there had been some concrete statements offered,'' 
said Bremer, bronze medalist at the 1994 World Championships. ``Nothing 
will change in my active career. This (problem) will go on forever,'' 
the visibly disappointed swimmer added. Bremer and Warnecke caused 
a stir with their statements on Germany's ARD Television last Sunday 
that the banned sustances were systematically used in measured doses 
to be nearly undetectable. ``You'll find testosterone and EPO in the 
pockets of swimmers everywhere in the world,'' Warnecke, an Olympic 
bronze medalist, said in the interview. ``With the help of a good 
sports doctor, you can regulate it so that someone is doped the entire 
year. When it's done right, it can't be detected at any testing,'' 
Warnecke added. Bremer, who echoed those statements of TV, said he 
hoped at the meeting that the German Swim Federation and German Sports 
Federation would take a lead role in cleaning up the sport. But Ruediger 
Tretow, president of the German Swim Federation, said the two athletes 
should have named names. He also believes few swimmers are being administered 
banned substances in measured amounts that allow them to slip just 
under testing limits. ``I don't believe that doping takes place in 
that way. In a gray zone that's certainly possible, but even then 
in a relatively small amount (of cases),'' said Tretow. After they 
made their charges last week, Bremer and Warnecke drew the cautious 
support of Harm Beyer, chairman of the anti-doping commission of FINA, 
swimming's world governing body. Beyer said there were ``too many 
hints'' to dismiss the claims, saying he heard deep voices, saw acne 
and noticed dramatic improvements in times in swimming pools at competitions. 
All are indications banned substances are being used to boost performances. 
The sport has been rocked by numerous doping scandals recently. Four 
Chinese swimmers were banned at January's World Championships in Perth, 
Australia. Three-time Olympic gold medalist Michelle Smith of Ireland 
was also suspended in August after tampering with a urine sample. 
Another top German swimming official said he couldn't understand the 
two swimmers' disappointment after the hearing, saying their charges 
were too vague. ``One can only be really active when things are concrete,'' 
said Sven Baumgarten, vice-president of the swim federation.
