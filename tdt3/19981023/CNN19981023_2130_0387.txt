The national research council has issued a report on the world's fisheries 
concluding that the ocean's supplies are seriously low and could run 
out. It's calling for a significant overall reduction in fishing. 
Declines in certain species have already forced some major fisheries 
to shut down. The government's national Marine fisheries service is 
developing plans to reduce the catch for unwanted species and find 
ways to rebuild fish stock.
