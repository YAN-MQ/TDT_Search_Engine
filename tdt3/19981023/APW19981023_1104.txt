Egypt affirmed Friday it did not intend to pardon an Israeli-Arab 
serving a 15-year sentence for espionage. ``The position of President 
Hosni Mubarak is steadfast and clear concerning the request to free 
the Israeli spy Azzam Azzam,'' Egypt's official Middle East News Agency 
reported. ``This position has not changed and no new (orders) have 
been issued concerning it,'' said MENA, quoting a senior government 
source. Israeli television and radio had reported earlier that Azzam's 
release was to be part of the peace agreement that Palestinians and 
Israelis were finalizing outside Washington on Friday. The reports 
were later denied by a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister. Azzam 
was jailed last year after a bizarre trial in which prosecutors said 
he supplied women's underwear soaked in invisible ink to an Egyptian 
accomplice. The accomplice used the ink to write secret messages to 
Israeli intelligence about Egyptian factories and Egypt's treatment 
of its citizens who had dealings with the Israeli embassy in Cairo. 
Israel denied that Azzam was an agent and has pleaded for his release.
