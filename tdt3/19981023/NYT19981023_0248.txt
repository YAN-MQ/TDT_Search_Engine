At the end of the exhibition ``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture'' 
at the Library of Congress, a slow, weak, singsongy voice can be heard: 
``I started my professional activity as a neurologist ... I discovered 
some new and important facts of the unconscious in psychic life ... 
I had to pay heavily for this bit of good luck. ... Resistance was 
strong and unrelenting ... the struggle is not yet over.'' It is Freud 
speaking. The year is 1938, a year before he died, when the BBC made 
a recording of him. Gallerygoers stand straining to listen, even though 
it would be far easier to read the text. Why? Because this is the 
first and only time in the show when Freud can be absorbed directly 
with the eyes closed. ``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture'' certainly 
does present a conflict, but it is not the one people might have expected. 
Two years ago, the Library of Congress suspended work on this exhibition. 
Although the library said the postponement was only for lack of money, 
that didn't stop rumors that Freud's critics, by circulating a petition 
against the exhibition, had forced the curator to go back to the drawing 
board to find a more negative stance. Now that the exhibition has 
opened, it is clear that the critics' wish has gone largely unfulfilled. 
True, there are witty passages about psychoanalysis sprinkled throughout 
the show, some critical, some merely quizzical, by everyone from Frederick 
Crews and Germaine Greer to Karl Kraus and Freud himself. Printed 
very high on the walls, they appear like the ghostly superego of a 
show whose healthy, robust point is that Freud, like it or not, has 
had an extraordinary influence on our culture, from Thurber to Popeye, 
Gershwin to The New York Review of Books. And who can argue with that? 
That doesn't mean the show is unconflicted. It is just that in this 
exhibition the fight is not between the Freudians and the anti-Freudians. 
It is between Freud and the visual. Freud was, as Michael S. Roth, 
the curator, concedes, famously ``anti-visual,'' a trait that could 
have something to do with the Jewish prohibition against worshipping 
graven images. It is, in other words, no mistake that Freud championed 
a talking cure rather than a looking cure. Freud had ``an intellectual 
defense against art,'' said Donald Kuspit, an art historian, speaking 
at a meeting of the International Institute of Object Relations Therapy, 
which coincided with the opening of the Freud exhibition. When Freud 
wrote about Michelangelo's Moses, for example, he treated it as ``3-D 
literature,'' analyzing what Moses' hand gestures meant, where in 
the biblical story they pointed, rather than admiring the chisled 
forms. As Kuspit said, he turned ``art into text.'' That poses a challenge 
for a curator: to turn Freud's words back into art. The heart of the 
show is a series of manuscript pages filled with Freud's German script, 
flowing confidently uphill, spilling into the margins and occasionally 
interrupted by a scratchy diagram. ``The task was to take manuscripts 
that people want to see but can't read, and make them available,'' 
said Roth. For Freud fans, he noted, these manuscripts have a ``fetishistic 
aura.'' Not everyone, however, can be charmed by yellowing pages full 
of a script they may not understand written by a historical figure 
they may never have read. For non-Freudians, passages from the manuscripts 
have been translated and blown up onto colored cards and explicated 
by the curator. But is that enough to hold the crowd's attention? 
The pull of the visual against the verbal becomes evident early in 
the show. A section on Freud's apprenticeship under Jean-Martin Charcot 
in the late 1880s at the Salpetriere Hospital in Paris includes Freud's 
German translation of one of Charcot's lectures and a description 
of Freud's use of hypnosis. But something keeps distracting the eye: 
the pictures of the hysterics who were treated by Charcot at Salpetriere. 
One woman looks as if she is ecstastically offering herself to God, 
another has her tongue out. Very dramatic. Freud knew well that the 
hysterics were fascinating, but he resisted the seduction. In fact, 
he became increasingly suspicious of the theatrics in Salpetriere. 
Hysterics often performed for the camera, the wall text notes, and 
the most photogenic ones got all the attention. But how do you get 
beyond the visual in an exhibition? Maybe you can't. If there is anyone 
who should be verbally intriguing, it is Anna O., the woman who came 
up with the term ``talking cure.'' But we don't hear from her firsthand. 
Instead, there is a general description of free association. That 
can't possibly compete with the visual festivities just around the 
corner: a television screen showing a medley of film, cartoon and 
television renditions of hypnosis and free association. There is Woody 
Woodpecker hypnotizing himself and Fred Flintstone hypnotizing Wilma. 
A clip from ``Get Smart'' has Maxwell free-associating for the Chief, 
giving ``girl'' for ``boy'' and ``white'' for ``black,'' followed 
by a scene from ``Dark Mirror'' in which a woman free-associates ``night'' 
for ``dark,'' ``beams'' for ``moon'' and ``scissors'' for ``knife.'' 
Then, it's on to ``needles'' and ``pins'' from the movie ``Marnie.'' 
There are six other visual medleys (one at the end of each section), 
produced by Sam Serafy to illustrate Freud's main concepts, and they 
are all hilarious. Dick Van Dyke, Popeye and ``Peanuts'' take on the 
perils of interpretation. The work of transference is accomplished 
by Bill Murray in ``What About Bob'' and by Jessica Lange in ``Francis.'' 
Salvador Dali's surreal sequence in ``Spellbound'' represents the 
mechanics of dreaming. Repression is handled by Fred Astaire in ``Carefree'' 
and by Homer Simpson. Laurence Olivier's Hamlet illustrates the Oedipus 
complex by making out with his mother. This kind of thing, Roth said, 
``reminds people they know something about Freud.'' Of course, they 
may be missing something, too. Because Freud is a verbal animal, such 
things as Freudian slips, jokes, dream interpretations, case histories, 
humor, wit and infuriating logic must all be read to be appreciated. 
That leaves the show in an awkward position. What is most Freudian 
cannot be shown and what can be shown is not really all that Freudian. 
Take, for example, Freud's dream theory. The show includes a picture 
of the house where Freud dreamed the dream at the center of ``The 
Interpretation of Dreams.'' But his analysis of it, which shows his 
brilliant train of associations and the self-justifying logic beneath 
them, is not given. And what of Freud's most famous patient, the Wolf 
Man? The show includes a painting he made of his own dream, a photograph 
of him and even his death mask. But the reason we're looking at these 
items is Freud's analysis of the Wolf Man's dream _ that the white 
wolves in a tree represented his having seen his parents have sex 
when he was an infant _ is not here. And so the first half of the 
show passes dutifully from free association to interpretation, transference 
to dreams, repression to the Oedipus complex, presenting all the documentation, 
defining essential concepts, throwing in a picture of Freud or two 
for good measure and putting in some visual touchstones. And all the 
while everyone in the crowd is waiting for a turn at the next television 
set. In the second half of the show, Freud's followers enter the picture, 
bringing some new blood. There are photographs of international psychoanalytic 
congresses, home movies of Freud's followers and books by defectors. 
And thank goodness that when Freud made his historic visit to the 
United States, he sent an excited, childlike telegram in English, 
with a misspelling, to his wife Martha: ``Succesful!'' When Freud 
shifts his focus from the individual to the social psyche, there is 
a vast desert of manuscripts: ``Totem and Taboo,'' ``The Future of 
an Illusion'' and ``Civilization and Its Discontents.'' Indeed, there 
is so little visual material that during a discussion of Darwin's 
effect on Freud, a picture of Freud with his dog in his study seems 
to be working as an illustration for the bestial element in man. Slowly, 
though, the impending world war starts to show in Freud's work: ``A 
Word About Anti-Semitism,'' and a diary entry on a book burning in 
Berlin, a work called ``My Subconscious Jewishness.'' In 1938, Freud 
decides he can no longer live in Vienna. It is pathetic to see a picture 
of the old man suffering from jaw cancer being taken to England on 
the arms of two friends, and it is even sadder to see film and a photograph 
of Freud's sisters who were left behind and murdered in concentration 
camps. Freud's last book was ``Moses and Monotheism.'' And after seeing 
this exhibition, it seems a fitting end. As the show points out, Freud 
closely identified with Moses and particularly with the moment when 
he brought down the tablets, only to be confronted with his followers 
worshipping the golden calf. One can only imagine Freud's reaction 
at catching a glimpse of his followers gathered at a television set 
while Homer Simpson explains repression.
