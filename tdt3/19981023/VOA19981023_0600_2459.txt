Russia objects to a draft U.N. resolution on Kosovo that would increase 
pressure on Yugoslavia to comply with terms of the Kosovo peace agreement. 
Russia is mainly concerned the resolution will allow NATO and the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to use force to 
carry out their monitoring missions. U.N. Security Council President 
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, says although good progress has been made, 
the resolution is not ready for adoption. A vote could come as early 
as today, after further discussions in the Security Council. Meanwhile 
the United States says it is pulling the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower 
from the Mediterranean. But the Navy says the West still has all the 
weapons it needs to enforce demands placed on Belgrade to end its 
crackdown against Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
