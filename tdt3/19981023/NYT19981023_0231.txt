Hurricane hunter aircraft investigating Tropical Storm Mitch in the 
Caribbean Sea on Friday afternoon found only weak bands of thunderstorms 
swirling around the storm's center. Earlier in the day, a burst of 
high altitude winds from the west had ripped heavy thunderstorms away 
from Tropical Storm Mitch, initiating a weakening trend. As these 
winds relax Saturday, the system may once again begin to strengthen. 
A strong cold front, a harbinger of the approaching winter season, 
will cross the Pacific Northwest on Saturday. As moist winds from 
the Pacific Ocean strengthen, areas of showers will develop from the 
central California to Washington. Cool air will advance steadily to 
the south and east, with showers reaching the northern and central 
Rockies on Saturday night. Meanwhile, a jet stream disturbance will 
trigger patchy showers from New Mexico to the southwestern Plains 
states. A sprawling high pressure system with barometer readings near 
30.5 inches of mercury will control most of the eastern two-thirds 
of the nation. Sinking air currents will sponsor ample sun from east 
Texas and the middle Mississippi Valley to the East Coast. Although 
frost will cover the ground in parts of the Appalachians and Tennessee 
Valley on Saturday morning, the afternoon will turn much milder. Saturday 
night will not be as cold, with any frost limited to sheltered locations 
in the higher elevation of the mountains. Meanwhile, winds from the 
east of the southern flank of the high will produce patchy clouds 
and showers across the Florida peninsula, with rip currents affecting 
beaches along the East Coast. Focus: Late Storm The end of the 1998 
Atlantic hurricane season is less than 40 days away, yet the Tropics 
have surged back to life late this week. Tropical storm Mitch was 
born from a disturbance that had hugged the Caribbean coast of Columbia. 
The storm was weak as it drifted toward Jamaica on Friday. A large 
area of showers in the Bay of Campeche showed signs of development 
Friday and a pair of disturbances in the eastern Atlantic made progress 
toward the northwest. The retreat of the westerlies from the United 
States over the next few days may help sustain the life of the late 
season storms.
