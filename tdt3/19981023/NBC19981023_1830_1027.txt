When the "discovery" lifts off next Thursday, it will carry Glenn, 
six other astronauts and a price tag of $477 million, and the skepticism 
of some who say Glenn's mission is long on style and short on substance. 
Here's NBC's Bob Faw. John Glenn was such a hero, many think he's 
earned a victory lap, another trip into space. But don't suggest that 
to Betty Grissom, wife of one of the original astronauts, Gus Grissom. 
I think it's a waste of taxpayers' money. She says she likes John 
Glenn, but complains he's getting "paid back" by the White House. 
They're paying him off for all the favors he's done for them. Glenn 
himself insists that he's going aloft to advance the cause of science. 
Protein turnover out of muscle, sleep experiments, things like that, 
I'll be able to do on this flight, have a very good scientific purpose. 
But "Apollo 15" astronaut Al worden told "associated press" -- "Geriatric 
study. Give me a break." And six-time shuttle astronaut story musgrave, 
forced by NASA to retire when he turned 61, says -- a space policy 
analyst with a nonprofit research group agrees. There's simply no 
medical research or space flight research reason for flying John Glenn. 
It's got a lot to do with inspiring the nation and nothing to do with 
serious scientific research. Glenn admits he lobbied hard for the 
trip. NASA director, Daniel Goldin, says he got at least 50 phone 
calls from the senator. NASA listened, because it needs John Glenn. 
Plagued by cost overruns and missed time tables, it's sent up 92 shuttles 
since 1981, but interest in the space program is lagging. Experts 
say this Glenn launch could revive that. but -- It is not earthshaking. 
I do not think it's gonna have a long-range impact on the U.S. space 
program. Some experts counter that the criticism is off target. The 
potential for learning new things from having an elderly man in space 
-- And seeing how his body reacts to this ten days of weightless weightlessness 
is quite high. It's also a tonic for older Americans, who cheered 
president bush's celebrated trip and who are prepared to cheer again. 
I think it shows what you can do later in life, and it shows the validity 
of a life, that you don't have only one moment, that you have a second 
moment. And I like that. So Glenn gets ready, and the debate goes 
on. Is this another giant step for mankind, or a joy ride? Bob Faw, 
NBC news, Washington.
