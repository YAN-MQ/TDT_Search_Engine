The Japanese government has taken control of one of the country's 
biggest banks as it strives towards economic recovery. I'm Liz George 
at the business desk in New York. The long-term Credit Bank of Japan 
has been nationalized under a new bank rehabilitation scheme bought 
in by the government today. The bank was one of the hardest hit by 
the global economic crisis and still has unrealized losses of more 
than $4 billion. Today's move means the Japanese government will now 
protect its depositors creating confidence and stability. And if other 
banks follow suit and seek state control, it could mark the start 
of an economic turnaround for the region and the world. Berlin Fabree 
is the chief economist with Bank Parabar. He says this will help soothe 
investors who have been shying away from the slightest hint of risk 
causing a worldwide credit crunch. The Japanese themselves, they've 
put up $500 billion to help bail out their banking system. The big 
question was: Would anybody use it because you don't want to be the 
first one in the door saying we need it. That once again brings up 
this whole issue of investor response to a problem. But nevertheless, 
it's there, it will be used for the long-term Credit Bank, and so 
therefore, we have some glimmers of hope, the steps that are being 
taken are good.
