Poles overwhelmingly voted for representatives of local parties in 
regional elections two weeks ago that showed serious losses for a 
center-right party led by the nation's finance minister, according 
to official results released Friday. The ballot was ordered under 
the Western-style administrative reform that reduces the number of 
provinces from 49 to 16 and transfers some decision-making powers 
to the lowest levels of local administration, dismantling the last 
remnants of communist-era central government. Local parties won 60 
percent of the of the 63,765 seats on provincial, district and various 
city and neighborhood councils, the State Electoral Commission said. 
The Solidarity bloc, which heads the national governing coalition, 
had the best showing of national parties, winning 17 percent of seats 
on the local councils. The ex-communist opposition won 14 percent. 
The Solidarity-based Freedom Union, junior partner in the national 
government, sustained substantial losses compared to the last local 
elections, in 1994, winning just 2 percent of the vote _ behind the 
leftist Social Alliance of farmers and pensioners who won percent. 
The result was widely seen as a slap at the party leader, Leszek Balcerowicz, 
who as finance minister is pushing through difficult reforms. He is 
also the architect of Poland's economic ``shock therapy'' that closed 
many inefficient plants, sent their employees on a dole and introduced 
free market competition in the early 1990s. Parties appealing to religious 
Catholics in this predominantly Catholic nation also had bad showings. 
The extreme nationalist alliance, Patriotic Movement ``Fatherland,'' 
won just .4 percent. And a party supported by the conservative Catholic 
Radio Maryja, the Polish Family, won just .2 percent of the vote in 
its first election. Turnout was an average 48 percent _ the highest 
ever in local elections and significantly higher than the 30 percent 
initially projected. The head of the State Electoral Commission said 
the turnout showed that the Poles ``eagerly approve participation 
in local government bodies.''
