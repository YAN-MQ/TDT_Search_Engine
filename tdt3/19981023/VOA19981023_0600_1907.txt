Moving now to Asia. The president of Cambodia's ruling party has appealed 
to opposition members of Parliament living abroad to return to the 
country, saying their safety is guaranteed. Shia Simm, the president 
of Hun Sen's Cambodian Peoples Party, said members of Prince Nordam 
Ranarid Funsenpec Party, Sam Ramsi's, Rengsi's self- named party, 
can return to Cambodia without fear of arrest, intimidation or provocation 
to contribute to the country's development. In a statement released 
today, Shia Simm also called for resumption of talks to former coalition 
government, but without the participation of the Sam Ramsi Party. 
Prince Ranarid has insisted that any talks also include the Junior 
Opposition Party. Yesterday King Nordam Sianuk rejected a request 
from the three parties that he mediate another summit of the country's 
top political leaders. The king said he sees no point in hosting more 
talks.
