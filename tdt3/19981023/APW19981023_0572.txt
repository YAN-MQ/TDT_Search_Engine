Jewish settlers said Friday they will shut down the West Bank with 
street protests and try to topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
over the land-for-security agreement he negotiated with the Palestinians. 
However, Israel's dovish opposition pledged to back Netanyahu on the 
peace accord and make sure he is not brought down by parliament during 
the 12 weeks Israel has been allotted to withdraw troops from 13 percent 
of the West Bank. Islamic militants, meanwhile, dismissed the deal 
reached during a nine-day Mideast summit at Wye Plantation in the 
eastern U.S. state of Maryland as a sellout and said they would continue 
plotting attacks in Israel. Jewish settlers said Netanyahu had broken 
his promises to his right-wing constituents. Jewish settler leader 
Aharon Domb said the prime minister had negotiated to an ``agreement 
of surrender.'' However, the news of the agreement came just hours 
before the start of the Jewish Sabbath at sundown Friday and settler 
leaders had little time to organize their protests. Shlomo Filber, 
a leader of the Jewish settlement movement, said that on Sunday protesters 
would block every West Bank junction to Palestinian traffic. The settlers 
will also work to bring down the Netanyahu coalition, Filber said. 
At least a dozen hard-line coalition members have said they would 
vote against a peace agreement in parliament, enough to rob the prime 
minister of his parliamentary majority. However, the dovish opposition 
said it would counter those votes and make sure Netanyahu will remain 
in power until the troop withdrawal has been carried out. ``We will 
give him a safety net for the coming weeks,'' said Yossi Beilin of 
the opposition Labor Party, one of the architects of the 1993 breakthrough 
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. On the Palestinian 
side, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder of the Islamic militant group 
Hamas, said the agreement brought the Palestinians little. ``Our people 
are paying more than they are getting from this agreement,'' Yassin 
told The Associated Press at his Gaza City home. As part of the agreement, 
the CIA would play a stronger role in the Palestinian Authority's 
campaign against Islamic militants, mainly Hamas which has carried 
out more than a dozen suicide attacks in Israel. Yassin said a new 
crackdown could perhaps restrict the activities of the Hamas military 
wing temporarily, but would not prevent attacks against Israelis. 
``It cannot erase Hamas,'' said Yassin. ``It is an illusion to think 
the agreement will put an end ot our military work.''
