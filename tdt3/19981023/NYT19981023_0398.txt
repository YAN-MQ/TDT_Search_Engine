Stock prices retreated Friday, breaking a run of seven advancing sessions, 
the longest in 16 months. No particular news seemed to account for 
the broad downturn, though the procession of quarterly earnings reports 
and company projections again claimed casualties. The victory parade 
for the New York Yankees was said to have held down midday volume. 
Even in decline, smaller companies continued to fare better than the 
blue chips, with the Nasdaq market _ including some high-technology 
giants _ easing 0.5 percent, or 8.78 points, to 1,693.86, while the 
Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 1 percent, or 80.85 points, 
to 8,452.29. The Russell 2000, composed of small companies, managed 
a marginal advance. Most analysts seemed unfazed by the setback, regarding 
it as a normal respite after an almost unbroken two-week advance that 
began just as major indexes flirted with declines of 20 percent from 
their peaks, the standard definition of a bear market. ``The market 
is due for a pause, especially before a weekend,'' said Larry Rice, 
chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``It doesn't hurt 
to have some consolidation here, a little pullback.'' On the other 
hand, some said the underpinnings of the extended rise had been none 
too solid, as reflected in the unimpressive volume of rising stocks 
compared with falling stocks. ``The last few days, the quality of 
the rally has been mediocre at best,'' said Nora McAuley, a technical 
analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``For a big up leg, you need 
to see 3-1 or better'' for the ratio of advancing to declining volume. 
Ms. McAuley called the last two weeks an interim rally in a downtrend 
and said it was ``not unlikely'' the market would slip back and test 
its Oct. 8 lows. Stocks were also lower in most foreign markets Friday. 
But except for Brazil, where the Bovespa index slumped 4.36 percent, 
none fell much more than 1 percent. The biggest contributors to the 
Dow's decline Friday were Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, which 
dropped 4, to 77 7/16, after it reported a 9.3 percent profit decline. 
The stock fell 2 13/16 on Thursday. Next came Merck, J.P. Morgan and 
DuPont, all down between 2 and 3. ``We've rolled 1,000 points'' from 
the Dow's Aug. 31 low, said Philip Schettewi, managing partner at 
Loomis, Sayles in Washington. He added, ``I think it's just natural 
short-term profit taking.'' Among blue-chip gainers, Citigroup did 
best Friday, rising 1{, to 46 9/16. Wal-Mart climbed 1 3/16, to 68, 
and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, rose 1, to 84. With a few exceptions, computer 
and software stocks were mostly lower. Microsoft, however, slumped 
3|, to 106], following a sizable gain, while Gateway beat earnings 
forecasts and rose 1~, to 51|. Bankers Trust jumped 5{, to 66~, in 
a weak bank group. It said it would turn a profit this month after 
having reported a huge third-quarter loss. Brokerage stocks were mixed, 
with Schwab, up 1], to 45], the best performer after announcing a 
dividend increase and a 3-for-2 split. Cox Communications, which hit 
a 52-week high Thursday, dropped 5 on Friday, to 56, in a broad retreat 
in cable company shares. At least one analyst downgraded Cox. Other 
movers included Dole Food, down 5, to 29|, after warning of poor third-quarter 
profits because of a world slump in banana prices. On the New York 
Stock Exchange, 637.6 million shares changed hands, compared with 
754.8 million Thursday. Losing issues dominated winners, 1,709 to 
1,292, with 33 issues making new lows and 22 new highs.
