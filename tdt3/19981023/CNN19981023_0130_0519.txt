I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"Headline News" forecast. A beautiful Friday morning with the exception 
of south Florida and the keys where we'll see some rain due to a frontal 
system and some clouds in the plains as well as in the southwest due 
to two areas of low pressure. But high pressure across the nation 
and beautiful weather into Friday afternoon and evening as well as 
Saturday morning with the exception of the pacific northwest coastline 
on Saturday morning. We'll see showers moving into Washington, Oregon 
and northern California. High temperatures for Friday -- very mild, 
70s in the plains states. The rest of the nation looking at 50s and 
60s. A few 80s in the desert southwest. Your extended forecast, showing 
rainy and windy conditions in the northwest. Thunderstorms over south 
Florida throughout the extended forecast period. And on Sunday, the 
showers extend down into the Rockies, scattered showers developing 
over the western Great Lakes and the northern plains. And into Monday, 
no showers pushed southward into the southern Rockies and the southern 
plains. A "U" front pushes into the northwest, but thunderstorms continue 
in south florida with the warm-up throughout the forecast period. 
And remember, you can get your four-day forecast for more than 7200 
cities at CNN.com.
