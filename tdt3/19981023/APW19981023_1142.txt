Two long-serving Nevada boxing commissioners, who both voted earlier 
this week to allow Mike Tyson to return to the ring, have been reappointed 
to new three-year terms. The reappointments of Nevada Athletic Commission 
chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem and commissioner Luther Mack were announced 
Friday by Gov. Bob Miller. Miller spokesman Gordon Absher said the 
timing of the reappointments was coincidental and occurred only because 
the terms of the two men expire on Oct. 31. ``The governor feels very 
strongly they have represented the state through some tough and interesting 
times,'' Absher said. Both Ghanem and Mack have played influential 
roles on the commission, voting last year to revoke Tyson's boxing 
license and fine him dlrs 3 million for biting Evander Holyfield's 
ears. On Monday, they both voted to return Tyson's license, while 
warning him that another violation would result in the former heavyweight 
champion never fighting in Nevada again. ``The last year and a half 
particularly, the eyes of the global public at large, and not just 
the sports world, have been focused on Nevada's Athletic Commission,'' 
Miller said. ``Throughout this trying time, Elias Ghanem and Luther 
Mack have been credible, professional assets to this commission. Through 
their long-term service, they have helped it emerge as the best in 
the boxing world.'' Ghanem, a Las Vegas doctor, was originally appointed 
to the commission in 1987. Mack, operator of a string of McDonald's 
restaurants in Reno, was appointed in 1989.
