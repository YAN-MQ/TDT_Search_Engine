Parliament approved a newly appointed defense minister Friday and 
pushed through a controversial wage hike for the president. Pavao 
Miljavac, a former army general, was voted in, 69 to 18 by the chamber, 
which is overwhelmingly dominated by President Franjo Tudjman's ruling 
Croatian Democratic Union. Opposition deputies objected acrimoniously 
to Miljavac, arguing that appointment of a military official would 
hinder Croatia's entry into Western defense structures _ primarily 
NATO's auxiliary program, Partnership for Peace. ``We can only accept 
a civilian defense minister as it corresponds with international conventions 
to which Croatia aspires,'' said Zlatko Tomicic, leader of the opposition 
Peasants Party. Military and diplomatic officials believe that a civilian 
is needed in the position, in order to carry out stringent reforms 
and implement drastic budget cuts needed to align the army with Western 
standards. Also Friday, deputies of the ruling party handily pushed 
through a controversial wage hike for Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
and members of parliament. Under the new legislation, effective Nov. 
1, Tudjman will earn 420,000 kuna (dlrs 70,000), while deputies of 
the bicameral parliament will pocket 198,000 kuna (dlrs 33,000) per 
annum. The 200-plus percent increase _ 14 times the average monthly 
wage _ was initially proposed in July to be 30 percent higher, but 
was slashed following widespread public outcry. The average Croat 
struggles to make ends meet on less than dlrs 500 per month. Pensioners 
receive half that figure.
