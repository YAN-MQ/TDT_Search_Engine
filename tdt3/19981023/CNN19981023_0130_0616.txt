The American gymnast who dazzled fans at the Atlanta Olympics two 
years ago is shying away from the spotlight. Aram Roston has that. 
That's a good one! Dominique Moceanu started competing when she was 
10-years-old. She was destined to be a gymnast, she has said, before 
she was even born because that's what her parents had planned for 
her. Now, at 17, this young athlete says her parents robbed her of 
her childhood by working her too hard on the mats. She's asking the 
courts to free her from her parents, certify her as an adult. She 
says in a lawsuit, that her parents controlled the money she earned 
as a world-class gymnast. As for her trust fund, she -- "has reason 
to believe that her trustee, her father, has mismanaged those funds 
and the trust is, for all practical purposes, broke." Her romanian-born 
father denies the allegations. He runs a large gym decorated with 
his daughter's trophies. All her money has been to the property and 
the gym. Building that gym. Dominique Moceanu's lawyer says too much 
has been kept secret. Why when she asked, he wouldn't tell her? Why 
when she earns all the money hadn't he cooperated? Moceanu was the 
youngest member of the 1996 gold-winning U.S. olympic team. Those 
familiar with the sport say a large portion of her earnings came following 
the summer games from tours and endorsements, making up to $10,000 
per night. It could score big! Oh nice. Her career revived this year 
during the goodwill games when she won the all-around champion title. 
Coming back from such hard work, and I've been through so much the 
past couple months and just wanted to prove it to everybody that I 
can still do it. She was training with a new romanian coach. Part 
of her current complaint is that her parents threatened to fire the 
new coach. She's given us a lot a trouble, she's not happy here. She 
demands a lot of money from us. Moceanu is now hiding from her parents 
and she's avoiding the public. She has made it clear she is a hopeful 
for a position on the U.S. Olympic team in the year 2000. Her parents 
say they love her, they want her back, and, in court filings, they 
say she should be forced to pay for their lawyer. Aram Roston, CNN, 
Atlanta.
