Still ahead, NBC news "in depth" -- John Glenn's return to space. 
Is it heroism in the name of science, or something else? It's got 
a lot do with inspiring the nation and nothing to do with serious 
scientific research. He's ready for liftoff, being hailed as a hero. 
But not everyone's ready to jump on the Glenn bandwagon. And a popular 
state senator, murdered just before election day. Now his opponent 
is behind bars. A bizarre whodunit. Dr. Scholl's next stop: San Francisco. 
Let's talk about feet. I do have corns. I've tried band-AIDS. They 
don't get rid of the corn. This is Dr. Scholl's cushlin gel corn removers. 
The cushlin gel relieves the pain. The medicated disk removes the 
corn. It just feels so much better. Man:ppMY work here is done. Why 
do I rent from enterprise? They COME PICK us up? Very simple. You 
pick us up? No stress. We'll be happy to pick you up. They arranged 
to pick me up free. This is great. So I don't have to ask anyone for 
a ride. see. No stress. Pick enterprise: civilian ]
