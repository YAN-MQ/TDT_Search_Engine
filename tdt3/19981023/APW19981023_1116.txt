French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine welcomed the land-for-peace 
West Bank accord reached in the United States on Friday, saying he 
hoped it would restart the Mideast peace process. Vedrine also praised 
the ``tenacity'' of Bill Clinton, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright and Jordan's King Hussein as well as the courage of Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat. ``I am thinking at this moment of all 
of those Israelis, all of those Palestinians and all of the peoples 
of the region who simply want to live in peace,'' said Vedrine, speaking 
on France Info radio.
