The interim peace agreement reached twin Palestinians and Israelis 
has hit a snag over convicted spy, Jonathan pollard. Apparent think 
former U.S. naval sbel skrens analyst was supposed to be released 
as part of the peace agreement. Pollard is serving a life sentence. 
Sources close to the talks say pollard will be released this weekend, 
but U.S. officials deny those reports. An Israeli source tells CNN 
until he's released, the accord will remain frozen. So far, Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Palestinian authority leader Yasser Arafat have agreed 
to a concrete security plan, aimed at ending violence on both sides 
and a lease of 13.1% of the West Bank, to be given back to the palestinians. 
Wolf blither has more on that. Tp Israelis have made concessions being 
the Palestinians have made concessions on some of the most sense I 
have tif issues, revising clauses in the Palestinian national covenant 
which call for the destruction of Israel. Releasing some prisoners, 
accepting another 13% withdrawal of troops from the West Bank. So 
there have been significant concessions made. But prime minister Netanyahu, 
pressed President Clinton very hard for the release of pollard. He 
did receive Israeli citizenship over the past few years and only over 
the past few months the Israeli government formally acknowledged that 
he had been a spy for the government of Israel. That was wolf Blitzer 
reporting. If approved, it clears the way for tougher issues, such 
as the future of jerusalem. Those talks have a deadline of May 4th, 
established by the Oslo peace accords of 1993.
