From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Craig Windham. 
At the White House this evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed a land-for-peace agreement 
concerning the West Bank. NPR's Mara Liasson reports. After nine days 
of marathon negotiations including an all-night session last night, 
the parties gathered in the East Room of the White House to sign a 
deal that commits the Israelis to giving up another 13 percent of 
the West Bank and the Palestinians to arresting suspected Islamic 
terrorists. For President Clinton, it was a victory coming after 18 
months of prodding and pushing and waiting. In the end, after all 
the twists and turns and ups and downs, all the late and ultimately 
sleepless nights, both reaffirm their commitment to the path of peace, 
and for that, the world can be grateful. The security guarantees will 
be monitored by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, a big new role 
for the CIA. The Palestinians had hoped to get Israel to agree to 
release thousands of political prisoners; instead, Israel agreed to 
release just about 700. Mara Liasson, NPR News, the White House.
