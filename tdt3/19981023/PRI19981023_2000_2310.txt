For today's Geo puzzler, we're looking for a national forest in the 
American southwest. Its 1.1 million acres are a geographical puzzle 
themselves. Cacti and pine trees are both abundant here, and there 
are also caves, a chunk of desert, a sub-Alpine forest, and three 
mountain ranges: the Sacramento, Guadalupe, and Capitan. In 1950, 
a fire ravaged this national forest and one of the survivors was a 
badly burned black bear cub whom firefighters decided to name after 
the nation's symbol for fire prevention. That's right, we're talking 
about Smokey Bear. Smokey lived out his years in Washington's national 
zoo but he was buried here in the 1970s. Still not sure where we are? 
Well, sit tight and we'll have the answer in just a few minutes.
