And before we go here, stone fill lips with a program note. Coming 
up on "weekend magazine," addicted to sex. Is it a disorder or an 
excuse for cheating on your partner? It makes for more opportunities 
with somebody with this tendency. They start believing they deserve 
it or they can get away with it or they're special in some way. Are 
they happy in their sexuality? Are they having enjoyable sex lives? 
They get a high from it, you know, a thrill from it. But I don't think 
it fully satisfies them, so an how later they're hungry again. That 
and more coming up next. And that is our broadcast for this Friday 
evening. We hope to see you right back here at this same time tomorrow 
night on monday. For all of us, good night. Have a good weekend. A 
quick thank you to my guests, Dennis Shea, Marianne fogelson, Peter 
Fenn and Richard goodstein. Coming up next, "the big show with Keith 
olbermann."
