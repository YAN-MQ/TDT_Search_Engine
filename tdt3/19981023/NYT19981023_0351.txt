The Clinton administration moved Friday to clarify the rights of hundreds 
of thousands of elderly Medicare beneficiaries being dropped from 
health maintenance organizations, and it threatened to impose fines 
on insurance companies that refuse to sell them coverage. But under 
pressure from insurance companies, the administration backed away 
from an earlier interpretation of federal law that would have granted 
similar protections to people under age 65 who qualify for Medicare 
because of disabilities. Some insurers had threatened to sue the government 
if it pressed this reading of the law. Insurance executives welcomed 
the administration's statement on the rights of people with disabilities, 
but consumer advocates denounced it as too narrow. HMOs in 30 states 
have notified the government that they are pulling out of Medicare 
or reducing their service areas Jan. 1, in part because their costs 
have risen faster than expected. The actions have caused confusion 
and alarm for more than 444,000 beneficiaries who, in the words of 
the government, are being ``involuntarily terminated from Medicare 
managed care plans.'' Beneficiaries have two basic options. They can 
enroll in another HMO, if they can find one. Or they can enroll in 
the original Medicare program. Most people in the original program 
buy private insurance to fill gaps in Medicare. Such Medigap insurance 
helps pay Medicare deductibles and other costs, and some policies 
also cover prescription drugs, one of the biggest medical expenses 
for people who are elderly or disabled. But Medigap policies often 
cost much more than what people were paying for similar coverage in 
HMOs. Medicare officials initially indicated that there was no reason 
for concern. But on Oct. 8, after government offices were deluged 
with complaints, President Clinton said Medicare officials must help 
``seniors who have been so shaken'' by the decisions of HMOs to withdraw 
from the program. In a bulletin sent Friday to all state insurance 
commissioners, the Clinton administration said, ``We are committed 
to trying to guard beneficiaries from undue concern and unnecessary 
hardship.'' Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the federal Health 
Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said that beneficiaries 
dropped from HMOs had a right to buy four of the 10 standard Medigap 
insurance policies. The policies that must be made available provide 
basic benefits, but do not cover prescription drugs. Companies that 
flout this obligation face a fine of $5,000 for each violation. But 
Ms. DeParle said insurers did not have to start selling Medigap policies 
to disabled people if they had not done so in the past. Insurers usually 
avoid selling Medigap policies to disabled people under 65. Bonnie 
Burns, director of consumer education at California's statewide insurance 
counseling program, said it was a ``tragic error'' for the government 
to conclude that disabled people did not have the same rights to Medigap 
policies as older people had. People with AIDS, multiple sclerosis, 
spinal cord injuries and other disabilities ``have a very tough time 
finding any company to sell them a Medigap policy,'' she said. But 
Charles Kahn, chief operating officer of the Health Insurance Association 
of America, said, ``We are glad the administration reconsidered its 
position and now has the same interpretation of the law that we do.'' 
He said Congress had never intended to guarantee the issue of Medigap 
policies to people with disabilities. About 18 states, including New 
York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have adopted state laws that guarantee 
some degree of access to Medigap insurance for disabled people under 
65. Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center, 
a consumer group based in New York City, said the administration's 
latest interpretation of the federal law was ``much narrower'' than 
its earlier interpretation. The 10 standard Medigap policies are designated 
``A'' through ``J.'' In a notice posted on the Internet this month, 
the administration said that disabled people dropped from HMOs, like 
the elderly, were ``guaranteed the right to buy from any Medigap insurer 
any Medigap plan designated `A,' `B,' `C' or `F.''' Moreover, ``Medigap 
insurers have the same responsibility to sell you a Medigap policy'' 
if you are elderly or disabled. Ms. Archer, whose organization counsels 
Medicare beneficiaries in the New York area, said: ``The Balanced 
Budget Act of 1997 protects people with disabilities whose HMOs are 
pulling out of Medicare. It guarantees them the right to buy Medigap 
insurance. But the government's narrow reading of the law undermines 
this right and may leave people with disabilities without adequate 
health care coverage.'' In a letter to state officials, Ms. DeParle 
said that federal law prohibited Medigap insurers from discriminating 
against elderly beneficiaries because of pre-existing medical problems. 
In other words, she said, companies ``cannot consider the health status 
of individual applicants in determining eligibility or premium levels.'' 
While the 1997 law does not require Medigap insurers to start selling 
policies to disabled people under 65, Ms. DeParle said, ``we encourage 
states to find ways to help these beneficiaries'' _ for example, ``by 
urging plans to extend coverage voluntarily.''
