Los Angeles Dodgers have taken the first step in turning around and 
overpaid and underachieving team. Davey Johnson former Mets, Orioles 
and reds manager was named the team's new skipper today. Johnson called 
the appointment the greatest moment in his baseball career. Hundreds 
of thousands of fans turned out for a ticker-tape parade in manhattan 
today to honor their world champion New York Yankees. Their second 
world championship in three years. 125 victories in all. A new major 
league record. There's only one thing that went wrong with the season 
in my opinion, that is we didn't get an opportunity to win the world 
series at home. I guess we are going to have to come back and do that 
next year.
