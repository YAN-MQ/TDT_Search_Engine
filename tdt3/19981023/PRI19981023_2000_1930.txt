Researchers at Columbia University in New York say they've discovered 
that monkeys can count but only from one through eight. THE WORLD's 
David Lavalle reports. The researchers show the two monkeys a mix 
of images on touch sensitive computer screens. Each image contain 
between one and nine circles or squares, and the two rhesus monkeys 
named Rosencrantz and McDuff were able to select them in order one 
through eight with almost no mistakes. They faltered when challenged 
with images of nine objects. The researchers say their study illustrates 
that animals can grasp some of the basics of math and quantity. Though 
it isn't considered conclusive proof that animals can actually count, 
the study is stirring speculation that mathematical skills may have 
evolved before language. For THE WORLD, I'm David Lavalle.
