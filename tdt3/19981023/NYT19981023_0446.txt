Like the weekend jogger who plods in designer Spandex and $150 shoes, 
the Grand Am GT strikes an athletic pose. The front and rear fascias 
are even more aggressive than the SE's; there is a wide-open air dam 
so the Ram Air system can breathe freely; thick ribs run up and down 
the body-side cladding; low-profile tires clench 16-inch wheels, and 
the exhaust rumbles a bit through four outlets. But like the occasional 
runner who stumbles into a time trial, the GT proves itself a poseur 
with more flash than dash. Yes, its 3.4-liter V6 is willing, with 
the Ram Air induction funneling cool, pressurized air into the engine, 
raising horsepower to 175 and peak torque to 205 foot-pounds (from 
the SE's 170/195). Yes, the four-wheel disk brakes are very good. 
And yes, the suspension is stiffer than the SE's, and the ride is 
rougher as a result. But the GT, as either a coupe or sedan, would 
rather sprint in a straight line than run in zigzags. You can attribute 
this misdemeanor to the usual front-wheel-drive suspects: There is 
serious understeer, which requires the driver to compensate constantly 
for the way the car plows ahead when the wheel is turned, and torque 
steer, which makes the GT's extra power a liability by whipsawing 
the front wheels on quick takeoffs. Further, the GT was excessively 
jumpy on harsh pavement, and the body leaned too much _ for an ostensibly 
sporty car _ on curves. This is not to say that the GT will disappoint 
everyone. It is inoffensive on smooth, straight roads, and it offers 
all the many features of the SE, plus some extras. The zippy dashboard 
looks more at home in the GT coupe than in the SE sedan, and the GT1 
package includes a nifty sunroof that opens at one touch of a button. 
The perforated leather buckets were marginally more comfortable than 
the SE's cloth seats, though they lacked side support. (Alas, the 
seatback release was notably clunky.) The GT has the plumage, but 
compared with agile dancers like the Mercury Cougar, Acura Integra 
or Honda Prelude, it trips over its toes too often. It is a Rockette 
without much kick.
