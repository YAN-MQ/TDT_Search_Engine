The day's top stories are next, followed by the closing numbers from 
Wall Street in "Dollars & Sense." And still ahead, who knew? Hollywood's 
favorite wise guy sings. In the global economy companies can't afford 
to shut down. So America's largest generator of electricity never 
rests. Southern company uses its resources to track the availability 
of oil, gas and electricity 24 hours a day. We keep our customers 
up and running while saving them millions. So at the end of the day 
they know we're still at work keeping the power on. We are southern 
company. Energy to serve your world. If you could accompany your data 
on its trip overseas the experience would be alarming. Local carriers 
handing it to national carriers over to cable carriers... till you 
don't know who has your data. Unless you send it through here. With 
the one and only company that owns the entire network-- local, national, 
and international. So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI 
Worldcom.
