Greek warplanes and navy vessels Friday joined the Cypriot military 
on the fourth day of joint military exercises that have underlined 
the potential for conflict on this war-divided Mediterranean island. 
A total of 10,000 Greek Cypriot troops, including 8,000 reservists, 
tanks and helicopters are taking part in the six-day war games, which 
will end Sunday. ``Its an exercise that makes us all proud,'' said 
President Glafcos Clerides whose government in the only internationally 
recognized administration on the island. The war games are held regularly 
with Greek forces under the provisions of a 1993 defense pact between 
Cyprus and Greece. Four Greek air force jets and five navy ships are 
taking part this time. The exercises are aimed at sending a message 
to Turkey, which invaded Cyprus in 1974 and occupied the northern 
third portion. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in the occupied 
area _ recognized only by Ankara _ was declared in 1983. Cyprus' Greek 
and Turkish communities have been living apart since the 1974 Turkish 
invasion and repeated efforts by the United Nations and others to 
reunite the island have so far failed. In the midst of the war games, 
Greece and Cyprus accused Turkish warplanes of violating the Cypriot 
air space Tuesday and Wednesday. Turkey denied the charges. Last March, 
tension rose on the island when Ankara dispatched warplanes and navy 
vessels to northern Cyprus in response to the use by Greek jets for 
the first time of a controversial air base near the resort town of 
Paphos in western Cyprus. In Friday's exercises, Greek navy vessels 
blasted mock targets off the waters of the Mediterranean south of 
the island, while Greek Cypriot troops used live ammunition and fired 
ground-to-ground missiles. Four Greek jets _ two F-16 fighter-jets 
and two A-7 Corsair bombers _ later joined the fray, firing at mock 
ground targets. It was the Greek air force's second day of involvement 
in the exercises. The Cypriot authorities are not saying whether the 
Greek jets are using the Paphos air base or not. The Paphos facility, 
which was completed in February, was built for the use of Greek warplanes 
since the Greek Cypriots don't have an air force of their own.
