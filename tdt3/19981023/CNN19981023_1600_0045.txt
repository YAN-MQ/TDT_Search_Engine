"Headline News." I'm Chuck Roberts. It is a historic moment in Washington. 
Excuse me. Within minutes, President Clinton, Israeli prime minister 
Benjamin netanyahu and Palestinian authority leader Yasser Arafat 
will sign a Mideast peace agreement at the White House. The pact ends 
a 19-month stalemate in the mideast peace process. Intensive negotiations 
went on for nine days at a secluded site in maryland. President Clinton 
led an all-night bargaining session that produced conflicting signals. 
At one point, the deal seemed set. But it hit a snag over Jonathan 
pollard, an American convicted of spying for Israel. And sentenced 
to life in prison. The Israelis said they thought the peace agreement 
included Clemency for pollard. President Clinton said he'd promised 
no such thing. The agreement will be known as the "wye river memorandum," 
and clears the way for the parties to begin final peace negotiations. 
The major points agreed to include -- As Jerrold Kessel reports, today's 
agreement faces obstacles in Israel. The big question is how much 
support they can corral in of the -- of the regular political community 
from the center down to the far right to see if they can really block 
this agreement. That's, they say, is their aim. But many in the right 
wing are distraught at the nature of the agreement as it's been unfolding 
here during the day but that done mean to say Mr. netanyahu does not 
have his supporters even within his own camp. But he will have a hard 
sell to make with -- with many of the people in the nationalist camp. 
We're waiting for all of the parties to show up at the White House 
to sign the agreement. It will be followed by final status talks which 
will be settling issues like the future of Israel, that is of Jerusalem 
and the borders of a Possible Palestinian state.
