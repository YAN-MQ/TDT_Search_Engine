Mike Sammond, "Headline Sports." For the second time in three years, 
New York City is throwing a party for its world series championship. 
The Yankees received a tickertape parade today, followed by a rally 
at city hall. The Yankees won their 24th world series title Wednesday 
night by completing a four-game sweep over the padres. You know they're 
going to question on where this ball club belongs in the history of 
baseball. I can only say one thing. In my opinion, 125 and 50. These 
guys are the best guys that have ever played the game. Every team 
from now on that has a good season is going to be compared to this 
team, the 1998 Yankees. And I predict when the history of baseball 
is finally written, this will be the greatest team in the history 
of baseball.
