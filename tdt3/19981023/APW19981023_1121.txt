Russia will increase vodka production by 60 percent next year, Deputy 
Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said Friday. Russia produced 82 million 
decaliters (217 million gallons) of vodka and other strong drinks 
in 1998, the Interfax news agency said. ``We will do our best to squeeze 
what we can out of this industry,'' Kulik told lawmakers from the 
Agrarian Party. The Russian government recently announced it would 
be taking a controlling stake in all 184 Russian distilleries that 
make pure alcohol _ a key ingredient in vodka _ in an effort to get 
more tax revenues. Interior Minister Sergei Stapashin said Friday 
that the government could earn up to 40 billion rubles (dlrs 2.5 billion) 
next year if the plan succeeds, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
In Soviet times, alcohol taxes amounted to about 25 percent of the 
federal budget. Today, the figure is around 2 percent to 4 percent, 
officials say. About half the alcohol consumed in Russia _ mostly 
vodka _ goes untaxed, according to government estimates.
