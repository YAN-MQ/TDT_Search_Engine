Also in Texas, environmental regulators have rejected a plan to build 
a nuclear waste dump near the Mexican border. The Texas Natural Resource 
Conservation Commission voted yesterday to deny a license for the 
dump, saying there are doubts it will be safe. The dump was to contain 
concrete canisters with radioactive waste from hospitals, industry 
and nuclear power plants. The Mexican government has actively lobbied 
against the project, saying the dump's planned location, just 30 kilometers 
from the border, would violate bilateral treaties.
