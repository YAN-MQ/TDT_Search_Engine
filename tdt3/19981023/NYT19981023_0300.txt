Russia defaults on its obligations, the Dow Jones industrial average 
swoons, markets around the world bounce around like yo-yos. Yet this 
Wall Streeter exudes calm. And why not? He takes a somewhat longer 
view. In fact, John Herzog, the chairman of Herzog Heine Geduld, a 
market-maker in over-the-counter stocks, can stare hundreds of years 
of financial history in the face just by popping downstairs. There, 
in the basement of 26 Broadway, the old Standard Oil building, just 
a few yards away from Bowling Green in lower Manhattan, is the Museum 
of American Financial History, which Herzog founded in 1988. The museum 
is celebrating its tenth anniversary this week with a gala and the 
public unveiling of a bust of John D. Rockefeller in the building's 
lobby at 6 p.m. on Oct. 29, the anniversary of the 1929 stock market 
crash. The museum, which is to reopen that day after a three-week 
refurbishment, will also mark its anniversary with a major new exhibition, 
``Going Public: Own a Share in the American Dream.'' The permanent 
collection boasts artifacts from America's financial history _ including 
one of the country's very first Treasury bonds, endorsed for payment 
on the back in George Washington's own hand. There are even bank notes 
from the Independent Republic of Vermont dating from the late 18th 
century, signed by Ira Allen, brother of Ethan Allen, the Revolutionary 
War hero. ``A bond or document signed by John D. Rockefeller or by 
Benjamin Franklin _ to hold that piece of paper can be pretty exciting,'' 
Herzog said in a recent interview at his office, seeking to explain 
the attraction of a museum of financial history. ``People see not 
just the piece of paper but the story behind the piece of paper.'' 
Herzog's love for financial history is something of a family passion. 
Just down the hallway from Herzog's office is R.M. Smythe &AMP; Com., 
a dealer in antique securities, which is owned and managed by his 
wife, Diana Herzog. It trades in old bonds issued but never paid by 
the governments of China and Russia, and even those of states of the 
old Confederacy, like Mississippi. These defaulted bonds, often surprisingly 
beautiful documents, printed on the best-quality paper in subtle greens 
and pinks, are collectors' items that can change hands for many thousands 
of dollars. Smythe buys and sells securities like the bonds issued 
by the government of Nicholas II, Russia's last czar, and by the Kerensky 
government in 1916 and 1917 to pay for the flagging Russian struggle 
against Germany in World War I. Many of these bonds were never formally 
repudiated. Once in a while, they can even regain a substantial fraction 
of their face value, if some successor government decides it wants 
to make peace with the capital markets by settling past investors' 
claims. Russia's current obligations, for example, which are now in 
default, might be a good bet for investors with strong stomachs, Herzog 
said. But, he cautioned, ``You have to be willing to lose 100 percent 
of your investment.'' All too often, of course, investors forget their 
painful financial experiences. Discussing the recent Russian financial 
debacle, Herzog recalls bankers' enthusiasm for a borrower like Russia 
_ apparently willing to pay very high rates of interest _ that had 
a history of burning its creditors badly. ``What might be more surprising 
is that Russian credits became somewhat irresistible, he said, recalling 
how so many sovereign borrowers defaulted on their bonds earlier this 
century. ``There was a willingness to get involved. It's an interesting 
commentary on how quickly people forget the hard-earned lessons.'' 
``When my father started trading bonds after World War I, they all 
carried high rates of interest, and they all defaulted,'' he added. 
History gives Herzog a lot of comfort at times like the present. His 
office is festooned with financial memorabilia, much of it from past 
manias, panics and crashes. ``Billions Lost in Wall Street Debacle,'' 
screams one newspaper headline from October 1987 that is framed on 
his wall. Such declines, of course, offer great opportunities for 
the hardy investor. ``In the perspective of history, we might be thinking 
this is a moment to make investments,'' he said, even in today's Russia. 
Discussing the way investors sometimes panic _ recently, over Russian 
securities, for example _ Herzog said, ``The psychology is on one 
side of the balance; the reality is on the other.'' Russia clearly 
fascinates him, particularly because of its checkered financial history. 
``I can't imagine that Russia would repudiate,'' he said. ``They even 
settled some of the czarist debt. Someone is out there buying this 
Russian debt. There was a Russian oil company selling at $1 a share 
that was selling at $30 a share. Some of these equities are out there 
as screaming buys.'' Not that Herzog (or his firm) is about to go 
out and start spending millions of dollars buying Russian equities. 
``I am not a specialist in all that stuff, although I have some sense 
of markets and have tried to develop some historical perspective,'' 
Herzog said. And should he feel especially tempted to take a flier, 
his museum contains all the reminders he could need of the value of 
caution in investing. The museum, whose main entrance is at 28 Broadway, 
is open weekdays, from 11.30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., or, for groups, by 
appointment. The museum also has a Web site: www.financialhistory.org.
