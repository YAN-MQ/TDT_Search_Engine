Now, as part of the deal, President Clinton has agreed to go to the 
mideast to address a Palestinian conference, where, at around mid 
December, as the agreement spells out, significant changes will have 
to be made to the palestinian charter. But that's later. Today was 
about the deal that almost wasn't. NBC news chief foreign affairs 
correspondent, Andrea Mitchell, has more on what's in it and the marathon 
effort that went into it. Like everything else in the mideast, it 
was anything but easy. Nine nonstop days and nights, including 90 
hours involving the president, and a final push from Jordan's ailing 
king Hussein. 7:00 A.M., the deal is done. Handshakes all around. 
Arafat leaves to get ready for the signing ceremony. Israeli officials 
even talk about how good a deal it is. This takes Israelis and the 
Palestinians closer to achieving peace with security. Suddenly, 8:00 
A.M., Netanyahu takes Clinton aside. U.S. officials say for the first 
time, he says he won't sign the deal unless the president first releases 
Israeli spy, Jonathan pollard. Convicted of stealing U.S. military 
secrets for Israeli. He thought it would help him placate his critics 
from the right and thought a weakened Bill Clinton would be in a position 
he'd have to go along. Aides say the president is shocked. He has 
twice denied Clemency for pollard. They argue. Clinton says he'll 
review the case. The summit deal is back on. The key to the deal, 
timing. Israel will release 6750 Palestinian prisoners and turn over 
land in stages but only after the Palestinians deliver their part 
of the bargain. They must cancel their 35-year-old threat to destroy 
Israel, stop releasing suspected terrorists, collect outlawed weapons, 
reduce the size of their police force, all to be monitored by the 
C.I.A., a dangerous role for america. I would hope they wouldn't be 
blamed if the this doesn't work, but I'm afraid they might be. After 
a week of arguments, the leaders trust each other less than before, 
while back home, extremists on both sides are already threatening 
violence certain to blow up the deal. Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, Washington.
