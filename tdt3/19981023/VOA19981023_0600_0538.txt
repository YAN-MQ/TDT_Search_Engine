In other news, technical experts from more than seven nations have 
met at the United Nations to discuss a report that the Iraqi government 
may have placed nerve gas on weapons before the Gulf War began. U.N. 
correspondent Max Rustin has details. The two-day experts meeting 
is reviewing laboratory tests carried out in France and Switzerland 
on remnants of Iraqi weapons. Tests carried out in the United States 
earlier this year on similar remnants showed traces of the chemical 
nerve agent VX. Members of the U.N. Weapons Inspections Commission, 
UNSCOM, say they hope the meetings this week will lead to more information 
on the extent to which Iraq placed the nerve agent on weapons. Iraq 
has repeatedly denied weaponizing the deadly nerve agent. It has accused 
UNSCOM and the United States of fabricating evidence in order to prolong 
the weapons inspection process. That process is required by Security 
Council resolutions and must be completed before sanctions imposed 
after the Gulf War can be lifted. U.N. spokesperson Marie O'Carby 
says the results of this week's meeting will be compiled into a special 
report and submitted to the Security Council on Monday. This meeting 
will assess the final batch of test results from a French laboratory 
and will complete the work of a technical experts meeting held earlier 
this month. A report on their findings is expected to go to the Security 
Council on Monday. Iraqi officials say they expect the results of 
the European lab tests on weapon remnants to undermine the U.S. test 
results. But UNSCOM officials say the U.S. test results were fully 
validated by the technical experts at an earlier meeting and therefore 
will not be undermined by any of the European results. They want Iraq 
to provide information that will give them a clear picture of how 
much VX nerve agent was produced, how much was weaponized and where 
it is now. One UNSCOM official says the testing process is similar 
to the inspection of a carpet on which some coffee has been spilled. 
Tests carried out on different portions of the carpet, he says, will 
result in different findings. But only one positive test is needed 
as evidence that coffee was, indeed, spilled. Max Rustin, VOA News,
