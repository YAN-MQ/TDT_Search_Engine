Nobody loves cars more than I do. Each one is a work of art. So when 
a maker of all these chose a new antifreeze, it got my attention. 
General Motors now uses the dex-cool technology of havoline extended 
life antifreeze in virtually all its new vehicles. The same patented 
formula you can use in your car. For 5 years or 150,000 miles. So 
do what GM did, switch to havoline. I use it in my car. I only wish 
this were it. We're closer today to finding a cure for leukemia than 
we have ever been. Acute promyelocytic leukemia is one of the deadliest 
forms of leukemia. Five years ago, if reece came down with this leukemia 
he wouldn't have made it. Pharmaceutical companies have developed 
very important and remarkable medicines. This new medicine has given 
us our family back. We have to continue moving forward because the 
answer is clearly within our reach.
