Finally this evening, we'll bury our prejudices for a moment and not 
give too much time to those great San Diego fans who gave their team 
a standing ovation though they lost. Yes, let's hear it for the New 
York Yankees. World champions, and deservedly so. The Yankees who 
won their second world seerries in three years, waded through a million 
New Yorkers and tons of paper today. The Yankees have done it again. 
The Yankees one 125 games, including the playoffs, the most for any 
team ever. I love New York says this man. The Yankees pitcher fled 
to the U.S. on a raft last December leaving his two small children 
behind with his ex-wife. The Cuban government allowed his daughters, 
2 and 8, and his mother to come to the U.S. today to see him. It is 
said that they'll return.
