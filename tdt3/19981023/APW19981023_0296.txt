Investigators are almost certain the murder of a senior Saudi diplomat 
who was found last week in his apartment with his throat cut was not 
politically motivated, police said Friday. ``My belief is that if 
it was some sort of political crime, they would have done it outside 
the embassy,'' Detective Sergeant Greg Ranse said. ``If it's a political 
crime, it's a very silent protest.'' Abdullah Al-Ghamdi, 54, first 
secretary at Saudi Arabia's Embassy in Canberra, was found dead on 
the kitchen floor of his apartment in Australia's capital on Oct. 
13. Police are appealing for help from the public to solve the case. 
Ranse Friday said investigators want to speak to a woman whose car 
broke down outside Al-Ghamdi's apartment some time in the days before 
his death. A tow truck driver has identified the dead diplomat as 
one of three people seen with helping the woman whose car had broken 
down near his apartment.
