The '98 vote for our report tonight on this year's election, we go 
to california. The big prize. California's home to more people than 
any other state. And whoever wins there will become -- after the president 
and a handful of members of Congress -- one of the most influential 
politicians in the country. Here's ABC's Jane Clayson. The political 
establishment looks to California because it is so big -- home to 
one of every eight Americans. The seventh largest economy in the world, 
even larger than China's. And more electoral votes than any other 
state in the union. Which is why the California governorship is considered 
the crown jewel of the 1998 election. It speaks to the future of the 
United States and it speaks to the momentum the United States will 
be following. In a word, California is a political trendsetter. From 
affirmative action and immigration to education reform and anti-smoking 
legislation. We're loud, we're big. People take notice of us. And 
that's one of the reasons why grassroots issues start here and move 
across the nation. For the national parties, California is also a 
trendsetter in how campaigns are won. Democrat Gray Davis is running 
a clintonesque campaign. Like the president, he has appealed to the 
crucial centrist vote, building an important coalition of suburban 
women, blacks and Latinos in this very diverse state. On the other 
hand, republican Dan Lungren has not been as successful in appealing 
to the middle, and in the waning days of the campaign, is focusing 
on a traditional, conservative republican message. There is a better 
choice, Dan Lungren will benefit us. Our message is one that resonates 
with the people of this country. They want their taxes lowered. They 
want welfare reform. The next governor will also help to literally 
redraw the political map here. California's 52-member congressional 
delegation will expand after the next census and the governor can 
help draw new district boundaries to his party's advantage, there 
is one more factor that makes this governorship such a prize. The 
presidential primary has been moved up to make it one of the earliest. 
The endorsement of the next governor will be a big boost to any presidential 
candidate. Jane Clayson, ABC News, Los Angeles.
