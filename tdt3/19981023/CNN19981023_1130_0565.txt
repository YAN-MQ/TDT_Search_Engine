Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu is scheduled to appear in a Houston 
courtroom today three days after she got a restraining order against 
her parents. The 17-year-old has asked the court to make her a legal 
adult. Moceanu claims her parents pushed her into gymnastics, then 
squandered her earnings. Holly Firfer has more on parents who may 
put too much pressure on their children. How far is too far to push 
a child to succeed? When your aim is for Olympic dreams, some parents 
feel there are no limits. He didn't want me to just go to the Olympics, 
he wanted me to win the olympics. It wasn't a matter of just going. 
It was, I was going to win the Olympics. For Amy Jackson's parents, 
winning was everything. So much so, they picked up their family and 
moved to Houston just so Amy could train with legendary gymnastics 
coach Bela karolyi. She spent hours in the gym, practicing and competing. 
She won medal after medal, but lost much more than that. we robbed 
our daughter of her middle childhood, from 9 to 12 or 13 years old. 
That was my whole childhood, and it's gone and now I can't get it 
back. Her struggle to lead a normal life ended when she finally quit 
gymnastics and attempted suicide. You have to let your child know 
that you're going to love them no matter what. If they want to leave 
gymnastics or figure skating or whatever sport they're in and go do 
something else or do nothing for a little while, that that's going 
to be okay with you, even if it's not. Today, Amy says she is finally 
happy. She's in college studying to be a sports psychologist so someday 
she will be able to help others manage the pressures. For Ashley Roby, 
balance has been the key to a healthy normal life. We're proud of 
her for who she is and not what she does. And she's a good person 
along with all of her talents. Those talents include more than just 
Olympic-sized abilities in swimming. She enjoys music, gets straight 
A's, and is able to find time to work out her horse. You're gonna 
have a million disappointments in swimming, because it's always by 
chance, it's racing. You never know who's gonna win. Ashley has dreams 
of the 2000 Olympics, but knows that if she changes her mind, that's 
okay with her family. And experts agree that it's healthy to encourage 
and support children's dreams, but that ultimately those dreams should 
be theirs alone. Holly Firfer, CNN.
