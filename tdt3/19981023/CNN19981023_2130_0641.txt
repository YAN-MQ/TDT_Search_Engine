NASA has new plans to travel dpeep near space without filling up the 
tank. John Zarrella has more. Beneath the layering is a spacecraft 
that may revolutionize travel to the planets and beyond. We feel we're 
getting to turn fantasy into reality, and that's exciting. Deep space 
one is a probe that after liftoff will head to an asteroid. But, where 
it's going is not nearly as important as how it gets there. For the 
first time, a spacecraft is being powered by ion propulsion which 
generates thrust by shooting out electrically charged gas. If it works, 
the technology is ten times more efficient than conventional rocket 
engines. The reason ion propulsion is better is because it uses less 
propellant. That means you can have a smaller propellant tank, less 
massive spacecraft and that means you can launch the space craft on 
a more affordable launch vehicle. The vehicle is also equipped with 
an experimental autonomous navigation system. Simply put, the probe 
always knows where it is in the solar system, knows where it is going 
and without help from humans, can correct its course if necessary. 
To use solar electric propulsion with our autonomous navigator is 
like having your car drive itself from New York to Los Angeles and 
park in its parking space all on its own, getting 300 miles per gallon. 
Deep space one is NASA's version of a prototype economy car built 
simply to see if it works. There are a lot of future missions that 
are looking at the results from deep space one, and a lot of planning 
for our future planetary missions will be based on how successful 
we are. With an ever shrinking budget, NASA is desperate for ways 
to make space flight more affordable and less risky. The breakthrough 
the agency has been hoping for could be this super efficient probe 
with a mind of its own. John Zarrella, CNN, at the Kennedy space center 
in Florida.
