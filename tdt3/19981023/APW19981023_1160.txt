Criticism of the head of the German railway grew Friday as the incoming 
railway union chief blamed chairman Johannes Ludewig's management 
style for poor morale, and a Greens lawmaker called for a new rail 
chief. ``The business won't become a success with his style of leadership,'' 
said Norbert Hansen, designated chairman of the railway workers union. 
Greens lawmaker Albert Schmidt said it was time for a change in top 
management at the national railway. The criticism adds to pressure 
on Ludewig. Several members of Deutsche Bahn AG's managing board recently 
have threatened to quit unless he goes. Ludewig hit back at the criticisms 
in Friday's edition of Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung, saying the 
June crash of an express train in Eschede, in which 101 people died, 
was the reason for the massive drop in income this year. The crash 
caused a profits drop of between 100 million and 150 million marks 
(dlrs 61 million and dlrs 92 million), the newspaper quoted Ludewig 
as saying. Deutsche Bahn didn't immediately confirm the contents of 
the report, but a spokesman defended Ludewig, citing constructive 
talks with union leaders that led to an extension last week of job 
guarantees for workers. The union says morale is low among the railway's 
30,000 train drivers, who are clocking up record overtime and can't 
keep to timetables. In addition, customers are getting badly looked 
after, they say. They blame Ludewig for creating expectations among 
travelers that trains would resume normal schedules faster than was 
possible following the crash, and for not making clear that the cause 
of the crash was the failure of a wheel produced by private company 
_ not the railway itself.
