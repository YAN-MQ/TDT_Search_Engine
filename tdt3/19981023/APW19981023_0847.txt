They were so close, just one more hill to climb on the rugged mountain 
path from Albania to home. Five adults carried some of the 11 children, 
with older kids helping the younger ones in the pre-dawn darkness. 
After a month in exile, they could return to their Kosovo village 
because last week's political agreement would halt Serb attacks, they 
thought. Then came the gunfire, killing one man, his two young sons 
and his niece. On Friday came the grief, with sobbing villagers burying 
the four in a hillside cemetery. ``Why didn't you take your uncle 
with you?'' Xhafer Sylmetaj moaned into the ear of his 2-year-old 
nephew Mazlummi, lying in a tiny wood coffin with a gaping bullet 
wound in his left cheek. Caressing the stiffened hands and arms, he 
softly said, ``We loved you. You loved us.'' The deaths Thursday in 
the mountainous border region between Kosovo and Albania showed the 
enormous gulf between last week's agreement by Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic that averted NATO airstrikes on his forces and 
the reality of daily life in the war-torn Serbian province. Despite 
the agreement's provisions for refugees from a more than seven-month 
Serb and Yugoslav offensive to return home safely, continuing violence 
_ including attacks by ethnic Albanian guerrillas on Serb and Yugoslaw 
forces _ and intimidation by Serb police hinders progress. ``We thought 
it would be better now with Holbrooke,'' said Hamez Sylmetaj, 73, 
the father and grandfather of three of the dead, referring to U.S. 
envoy Richard Holbrooke's agreement with Milosevic. ``If we are not 
helped by America and Europe, then the Serbs will continue to do this.'' 
A Yugoslav army statement issued in Pristina described the killings 
as a shootout between border guards and Albanian guerrillas who used 
women and children as shields when smuggling weapons. The army said 
the smugglers fired first after being warned to stop, and that four 
people were killed and two wounded, all of them Albanians. Survivors 
related a far different story. Fadil Sylmetaj, his eyes puffy from 
weeping, said no warning was issued as he and his brother led their 
wives and six children, along with their sister-in-law and her five 
kids on the final steps of an eight-hour journey from Albania. ``They 
didn't even say stop, or do this or that. They just started shooting,'' 
he said. ``I couldn't protect the children. It was so awful.'' In 
a room of moaning, wailing women wearing the white scarves of grief, 
Lindita Sylmetaj, 15, also described the shooting as sudden. She had 
a small cut under her left eye and stitches in her left ear from a 
bullet graze, and her hands nervously tied and untied her scarf as 
she spoke. ``We didn't see anybody, they just started shooting at 
us'' she said above the grieving din. ``The children were screaming 
and my uncle yelled, `Stop firing, stop shooting us.' While I was 
getting up to help my cousin, another shot hit me. They were shooting 
again.'' When it stopped, Ramiz Sylmetaj, 27, and his sons Muharremi, 
6, and Mazlummi were dead. His wife Ashja, 23, was seriously injured. 
Lindita's sister Leonora, 12, also was badly hurt. ``We carried her, 
but after we left the soldiers, she died,'' Lindita said. Mourners 
packed another room where the bodies lay, Leonora's pale face cradled 
by her mother and grandmother. When the coffin of Mazlummi was opened, 
several women screamed and some were carried out, convulsed in grief. 
``I'm 75 years old,'' muttered Fetah Thaci, wearing the traditional 
white dome cap of Albanian elders. ``I remember World War II. Milosevic 
is worse than Stalin or Hitler, to massacre women and children.'' 
The Sylmetaj brothers took their families to Albania on Sept. 20, 
fearing attack in a Serb police and Yugoslav army offensive in the 
area south of Jakovica in southwestern Kosovo, relatives said. After 
the Oct. 12 agreement between Holbrooke and Milosevic, they decided 
to return, even though more police and soldiers were seen in the region. 
``After we crossed the border, I felt like I was home,'' Lindita said. 
``I wasn't afraid of anything.''
