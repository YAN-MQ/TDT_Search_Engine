The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies has 
issued its annual report on the military capability and defense spending 
of 170 countries. The world survey shows an increase in defense spending 
and the arms trade, especially in the Middle East. VOA's Laurie Kassman 
reports the author's other report also see an increased used of threatening 
force as a diplomatic tool. The military balance reports this year 
sees a growing problem with how the west is dealing with conflicts 
that erupt around the world. The study says U.S. military resources 
are being stretched thin by deployments in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans 
and other areas of potential conflict. But the Institute's director 
John Chipman says the study also shows a new trend toward using the 
threat of force as a diplomatic tool. In a case of Yugoslavia, Mr. 
Chipman says the strategy actually has forced President Slobodan Milosevic 
to accept an international presence in Kosovo, something the Yugoslav 
president had always opposed. Mr. Chipman says the only way to achieve 
full compliance is to include the threat of sending in fully armed 
ground troops. The annual survey also shows that defense spending 
is on the increase, up 12 percent from last year. But Russia's arm 
sales have dried up, largely because of the economic downturn in Asia 
where most of its customers are based. Laurie Kassman, VOA News, London.
