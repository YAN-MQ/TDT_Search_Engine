Michiko Hattori fired a 4-under-par 68 to take the lead in the opening 
round of the Hisako Higuchi Kibun Classic. Hattori, who won the Japan 
LPGA Championship last month and has two other tour victories this 
year, carded four birdies against no bogeys on the 6,290-yard, par-72 
Green Briar West Village course in southwestern Japan. One stroke 
behind was Taiwan's Huang Yu-chen, who sank three birdies against 
no bogeys. Huang, 25, won her first career title in June at the Dunlop 
Ladies Open. In third place was Chihiro Furukawa, who shot a 2-under 
70. Four players _ Fuki Kido, Aki Nakano, Mikino Kubo and Yukiko Isiguro 
_ shared four place at 71. A total of 108 players, including 16 foreigners, 
teed off in cloudy weather. The winner will receive 12.6 million yen 
(dlrs 106,000) from a purse of 70 million yen (dlrs 588,000).
