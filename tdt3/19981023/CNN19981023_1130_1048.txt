The nation's two leading bus carriers are announcing an alliance. 
Greyhound lines and Peter pan bus lines say they will share their 
bus routes between major cities in the northeast. Earlier this week, 
Greyhound was acquired by Canada's laidlaw, which already owns Greyhound 
bus lines in Canada. A Greyhound spokesman tells CNN the move will 
not result in any job cuts and is instead aimed at increasing business 
for both companies.
