A High Court judge has ruled that the constitutional rights of a Jehovah's 
Witness were not violated when he was fired from his teaching job 
for refusing to sing the national anthem or recite the national pledge. 
``This is one case where the interest of the state in the education 
system must prevail over those of the individual,'' Judge Tan Lee 
Meng said in his ruling, made available Friday. He ruled that Peter 
Nappalli, who was fired in 1994 after 10 years as a teacher at a technical 
school, should have known before he sought the job that it required 
practices that Jehovah's Witnesses find objectionable. Nappalli, 37, 
who sued the Institute of Technical Education in 1995, seeking reinstatement 
and back pay, argued that no law in Singapore requires any citizen 
to sing the anthem or recite the pledge. He said the the school violated 
the constitution by imposing such regulations and deprived him of 
his rights by giving him the choice of keeping his job or breaking 
the tenets of his religion. The case was heard in early August. Judge 
Tan, in a ruling completed Thursday, said no compulsion was involved, 
because Nappalli voluntarily sought the teaching job. Nappalli, or 
anyone who has attended school in Singapore, knows that the pledge 
and the anthem are requirements, the ruling said. The judge also said 
Nappalli had not been ``forthright'' in filling out his application 
because he did not state that he was a Jehovah's Witness and withheld 
the fact that he had served three years in a prison camp for refusing 
to serve in the armed services because of his religion. Judge Tan 
said that the school had the right to require teachers to participate 
in the ceremonies, as part of its duty to promote patriotism among 
students. He quoted a 1994 case in which Singapore's Chief Justice 
Yong Pung How said, the ``sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore 
are undoubtedly the paramount mandate of the constitution and anything, 
including religious beliefs and practices which tend to run counter 
to these objectives, must be restrained. '' Despite a constitutional 
guarantee of freedom for individuals to profess, practice and propagate 
their faith, laws in Singapore restrict those rights. For example, 
the Jehovah's Witness denomination has been banned since 1972 from 
meeting as a group and owning land for a sanctuary. Individuals have 
been prosecuted under criminal law for possessing the Jehovah's Witness 
version of the Bible. Jehovah's Witnesses estimate there are 1,400 
to 1,600 adherents in Singapore, while government estimates have ranged 
up to 2,000.
