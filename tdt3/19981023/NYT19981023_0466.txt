The first debate in the campaign for New York state attorney general 
quickly turned nasty Friday as Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco repeatedly 
called his Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, a liar and a lawbreaker, 
while Spitzer swung back by raising questions about Vacco's ethics. 
``I think it is somewhat ironic that the very laws you seek to enforce 
you are currently in violation of,'' Vacco said, accusing Spitzer 
of failing to properly notify the state about his use of eight cooperative 
apartments he owns in Manhattan as collateral for a loan he took out 
to finance his campaign. The attorney general read from a document 
that he said was signed by Spitzer's father, Bernard, a wealthy real-estate 
developer, saying that the apartments had not been used as collateral 
for a loan. ``Either this statement is perjurious,'' Vacco said, ``or 
the source of your money is not being truthfully stated.'' Spitzer, 
however, brushed off the charges, maintaining that all the appropriate 
documents had been filed. He also sought to put to rest accusations 
from the Vacco campaign that Spitzer's father has illegally contributed 
$4 million to his campaign. ``My answer to him is, humbug,'' Spitzer 
said. He said there is a promissory note that establishes that he 
is spending his own money, and he accused Vacco of waging a ``tawdry'' 
campaign through news releases smearing Spitzer's father. Abruptly 
trying to shift the focus, Spitzer cited a recent news report saying 
that the attorney general received $37,500 in campaign donations from 
subsidiaries of a car leasing company after settling a lawsuit with 
the parent company. ``The issue should be, why is the attorney general 
accepting contributions from companies that have investigations pending 
before the office?'' Spitzer said. The debate, taped at the studios 
of News 12 Long Island for broadcast last night on that station and 
two other News 12 stations in Westchester County and the Bronx, shed 
little light on these questions. But in a race that has received minimal 
news coverage, it gave both candidates the chance to outline their 
philosophies about the office. Sunday, the two candidates are scheduled 
to meet again for a one-hour debate to be carried live on WABC-TV 
in New York City and on ABC affiliates throughout the state beginning 
at 11:30 a.m. Spitzer sought to portray his opponent as a captive 
of partisan interests who has sullied an office that used to command 
more respect. ``This is a race,'' Spitzer said, ``about restoring 
the grandeur and majesty of an office defined by a simple principle: 
the attorney general's office is supposed to be the law firm for the 
people of the state of New York.'' He said he would be more energetic 
and aggressive in enforcing environmental, antitrust and civil rights 
laws. At the same time, Spitzer, a former assistant district attorney 
in Manhattan, said he would not abandon the office's role ``to keep 
our streets safe'' _ although he acknowledged in a campaign appearance 
Thursday that the attorney general plays a limited role in combating 
street crime. As he has throughout the campaign, Vacco emphasized 
Friday that he had fulfilled a pledge to redefine his office to make 
it more relevant to the public. ``Over the years, the attorney general's 
office had grown disconnected from the people and was uninvolved in 
some of the most important issues confronting New Yorkers,'' he said. 
He said that he had stepped up prosecution of violent crimes without 
neglecting other more traditional duties and cited his efforts on 
behalf of patients' rights and against consumer fraud, child pornography 
on the Internet and nursing-home abuses. The two candidates disagreed 
on whether the attorney general should force General Electric Co. 
to clean up PCBs that were legally dumped into the Hudson River before 
the cancer-causing chemical was banned in 1977. Accusing the Republican 
administration of sitting on its hands, Spitzer said he had met with 
GE officials and felt confident that an agreement could be reached 
in a few months. But Vacco said experts disagreed on whether the toxic 
sediment in the river should be dredged. He asserted that the two 
decades-old controversy should be resolved by federal environmental 
officials.
