The Dominican Republic has bestowed one of its highest honors on favorite 
son Sammy Sosa, the Chicago Cubs slugger who, along with Mark McGwire, 
roared past the previous single season record for home runs this season. 
At a ceremony in Santa Domingo today, Sosa said he accepted the honor 
not as a Major League baseball player but as a Dominican who has been 
lucky enough to see his efforts crowned with triumph. Thousands of 
people cheered. Sosa said he planned to use his visit home to help 
victims of Hurricane Georges. I'm Craig Windham, NPR News in Washington.
