With us tonight, Richard haass, an NBC news consultant. He is with 
us tonight from our Washington bureau. Richard, when we were on the 
air earlier today with the ceremony from the east room, you said something 
striking that was kind of sad in retrospect, and that is that the 
deal will hold until the bombers go to work, as you put it. Is it 
that predictable? And are these talks as weak as one person wired 
with explosives walk sboog a convenience store? I think it is inevitable 
to say that the bomenters will at some point get to work. If history's 
any guide, when the peace process moves forward, so do the bad guys. 
Is it inevitable that they work? no. That's the interesting question. 
The real challenge of this gokse is whether they're willing to stay 
the course if and when the bombers do strike. That's when we'll find 
out whether they're politicians or statesmen. Does it come down to 
just one brave leader? We have seen a string of, regardless of your 
party or stripe, some very brave individuals come to these talks in 
the White House, a man who led the last round is no longer with us. 
King Hussein today, what a dramatic performance by him. It's funny. 
It's one of the great debates of history, whether it's events or people 
who matter. The more I watch, I think people do matter. I don't think 
we would have gotten as far as we have gotten without so many leaders. 
Maybe it will take someone with right-wing credentials to work with 
prime minister Netanyahu to persuade Israelis to take risks for peace. 
Arafat might be in some ways, as the father of the Palestinian people, 
he might be the one man who can persuade them to take less than the 
full loaf. Let's pretend these three nations are stocks. Handicap 
them for me. Are the following on the upswing tonight let's say before 
the opening of markets on Monday? The United States as a broke-of 
peace. The Palestinian state, is it on the rise? Did Israel get enough 
out of this? I think all probably vose very slightly. It was probably 
a good day for all three, but it was moddest and in no way destined 
to last. Each and all of them could easily be reversioned. Richard 
haass, who saw so much of this kind of talk as a study of this kind 
of matter, has been with us all day watching the unfolding peace deal. 
Thanks for coming on the air. Thank you.
