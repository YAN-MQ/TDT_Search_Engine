Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, is barring gay 
alumni from the campus. Campus officials sent some former students 
a letter that said they will be arrested for trespassing if they show 
up at the school. However, gays will be allowed to visit the University's 
art museum which is a separate nonprofit organization. Banning gays 
from the museum could jeopardize its tax-exempt status.
