This is the month to promote breast cancer awareness and detection. 
Doctors in the midwest are about to test a new way to screen for the 
disease. They say it could be more reliable than the traditional breast 
X-Ray. Dan Rutz explains. Creating beautiful designs brings a certain 
satisfaction to briony foy. It also helps distract her from a nagging 
fear of breast cancer. Her mother died of it at an early age, and 
like many middle-aged women, briony's breast tissue is naturally lumpy 
and dense. That makes cancer screening difficult. While a lot of attention 
is focused on the importance of breast cancer screening, much less 
is said about its limitations. Blue is bad in this color-coded example 
of 21st century cancer detection. Professor hadassa degani of Israel's 
weizmann institute uses mri images, which require no X-Rays, to distinguish 
cancerous from benign breast lumps. Breast cancer, because of the 
need to have early detection and accurate means of diagnosis, is probably 
one of the first areas that I as a woman or as a scientist would like 
to see this potential of the method being implemented. In Wisconsin, 
Dr. Frederick kelcz has been using mri for several years as a tiebreaker, 
to help rule cancer in or out for women whose standard examinations 
are inconclusive. And it's basically those patients in whom we've 
done the mammography, we've done the ultrasound. We still can't figure 
out what's going on and we're somewhat concerned about what we see. 
Now kelcz and some Chicago area doctors will help test mri as a General 
screening tool for breast cancer. Women with tumors of unknown origin 
will be routinely offered mri in addition to biopsies, where suspicious 
tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. If the electronic 
imaging proves reliable, it could eventually reduce the need for such 
surgical biopsies. All women stand to gain if the new technology works, 
especially those, like briony foy, whose families have been hardest 
hit by breast cancer. I have four younger sisters, I have nieces, 
there's a lot of people out there. And not just worried about breast 
cancer. Once proven to be accurate, degani says the color-code diagnosis 
could be used for finding cancers elsewhere in the body early enough 
to save more lives. Dan Rutz, CNN, Madison, Wisconsin.
