As for the spy, Jonathan pollard, Israeli pressure to release him 
has been applied before, but never quite in this fashion. Who is this 
man who evokes such strong feelings between allies? NBC's Pete Williams 
tonight. He's in a class by himself. Pollard, the only American ever 
sentenced to life in prison for spying for a U.S. Ally. In the early 
'80s, working as a civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. navy, 
he became convinced the U.S. wasn't doing enough for Israel. So on 
his own, he began smuggling top secret papers out of the naval intelligence 
center, handing them to Israeli contacts, who set up a High-speed 
copier at a Washington apartment house. By the time the FBI caught 
up with him, in 1985, trying to seek asylum at israel's embassy, he'd 
been spying for 18 months. Enough time, the defense department said, 
for pollard to fill 30 file cabinets with stolen documents, closely 
guarded secrets about U.S. weapons, and even worse, on intelligence 
sources in the Middle East that were cut off after pollard's spying. 
One author says there's no telling what Israel did with that information. 
What would be stopping the Israelis from brokering that information 
giving it to, for example, the Russians in exchange for something 
that they wanted or even to another Middle Eastern country. And the 
man who prosecuted pollard 12 years ago says it would be a disaster 
to release him. What the Israelis are, we understand, asking us to 
do, is to give them an american who betrayed America, and that is 
clearly nonsensical. Intelligence officials say pollard shows no remorse, 
even trying to put classified information he remembers into the letters 
he mails from prison. Pete Williams, NBC news, Washington.
