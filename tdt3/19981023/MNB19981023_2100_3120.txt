When we come back, a look at the Saturday morning newspaper headlines 
and today's arrival by air in New York not thought possible just days 
ago. Mideast peace deal dominates front pages around the country as 
we look at the morning headlines tonight. There's also this, the "Miami 
Herald," breast cancer Gene test goes mainstream. It can be a marker 
for whether or not women are prone to breast cancer. It's not rock 
solid. There are false positives. The problem is, and the developing 
ethical and legal battle is, if this is a good test, an indication 
of a woman's level of breast cancer risk, can women lose their insurance 
or see their rates climb if they test positive? Several state legislate 
turs are trying to jump out ahead. On MSNBC.com, if you know someone 
with a pacemaker, don't hesitate between the two markers that check 
you for shoplifting tags. They emit something that stops some pacemakers. 
"Washington Post," affirmative action ban foes race for votes. It 
bans racial and gender preferences in public education, a lot like 
what happened in California, though it doesn't mention affirmative 
action by name.
