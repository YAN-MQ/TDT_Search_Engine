There's been another strange development in Tennessee politics. First, 
the leader candidate was shot to death and found in his truck on monday. 
Then his opponent went missing. Now, he has been arrested and charged 
with murder. ABC's Steve Osunsami picks up the story in Tennessee. 
Tommy burks was a well-respected man, a farmer, a friend and a State 
senator who served this community for the past 28 years. But on Monday, 
he was shot in cold blood in his truck on his way to meet school children 
at his farm's pumpkin patch. This case is the type of a case that 
comes along every once in a while that strikes at the very heart of 
our system. The crime alone was shocking, but this morning, there 
was more. Police arrested burks' political opponent and charged him 
with the murder. 34-year-old Byron looper is the republican challenger, 
a county tax assessor, now accused of killing the popular encumbent 
just two weeks before the November election. The local sheriff worked 
with both men. It sounds like fiction. But it's true. The news has 
stunned this two-county area, where many say looper could never have 
beaten the six-term encumbent. Looper mysteriously disappeared the 
night of the murder. His friends believe he's falsely accused. What 
we have here is an absolute hysteria. He is the most hated human in 
this area of the world. Looper is a controversial figure, sued by 
his ex-girlfriend and accused of theft and misusing his office. This 
time, he faces life in prison or death if he's convicted. But under 
state law, he's still listed on November's ballot. Burks supporters 
are now supporting a write-in candidate, his widow. Their choice to 
fill the open seat in Nashville. Steve Osunsami, ABC News, Tennessee.
