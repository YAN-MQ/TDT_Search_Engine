Germany's Finance Ministry, banks and businesses agreed Friday that 
Europe's future single currency, the euro, will be brought into circulation 
slowly over a two month period in 2000, rather than with a ``big bang'' 
as earlier planned. Fifteen groups representing banks, the retail 
industry and vending machine companies agreed with Germany's Finance 
Ministry that the German mark will be eased out of circulation between 
Jan. 1-Feb. 28, 2002. The decision affects only Germany, and it was 
not immediately clear what impact it would have in the 10 other European 
nations launching the single currency Jan. 1. As of that date, monetary 
policy, including a unified interest rate, will no longer be set by 
national central banks or by finance ministries, but by the European 
Central Bank located in Frankfurt. The euro will function as the official 
currency with a set exchange rate against the national currencies 
being phased out. The actual introduction of bills and coins is the 
last phase of the union, officially set for New Year's Day 2002. The 
decision in Germany allows businesses to continue accepting marks 
for two months. The parties also included language encouraging flexibility 
after Feb. 28, apparently to give businesses leeway to accommodate 
customers struggling to make the transition. Five national banking 
associations agreed that banks will German mark notes and coins for 
over-the-counter transactions for the first two months of 2002. Likewise, 
shops will accept the national currency, although they will only take 
coins up to the value of DM 20 (dlrs 12.5.) Changing the technology 
for thousands of vending machines selling subway tickets, sodas and 
a host of other items has been a vexed question, and the meeting gave 
greater leeway. Vending machines calibrated for marks may continue 
operation until makers are able to finish the conversion. Germany's 
Economic Ministry welcomed the agreement, saying it will secure ``a 
successful entry'' to the euro. ``Customers will get the necessary 
information and at the same time complicated bureaucratic rules and 
costs will be avoided,'' the Economic Ministry said in a statement.
