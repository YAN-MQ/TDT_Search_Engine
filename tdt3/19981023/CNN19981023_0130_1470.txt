Japan is getting another taste of Disney and it's a little bit fishy. 
The Walt Disney company started construction Thursday on a nearly 
$4 billion dollar ocean-themed park next to Tokyo Disneyland. They're 
calling it "Disney sea" and hope it will draw more than 10 million 
visitors a year, when it opens in 2001. That would follow the success 
of Tokyo Disneyland which had 17 million visitors last year, despite 
Japan's deep recession.
