The United States may have had a warning about the bombing of the 
American embassy in Kenya. "The New York Times" reports an Egyptian 
now held for the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Tanzania gave intelligence 
officers at the Nairobi embassy information about the plot nine months 
before the explosions. The embassy is said to have increased security 
for a few weeks, but returned to normal when there was no attack. 
The state department says it was not warned. The blasts killed 224 
people, including 12 Americans and injured 5,000 others.
