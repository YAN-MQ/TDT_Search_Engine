Japan's top five automakers reported year-on-year production declines 
in the six months ending in September. Experts were hurt by the economic 
crisis in Asia and expanded overseas production. Four of the five 
Japanese automakers showed double-digit declines in production between 
April and September. Mitsubishi Motors had the biggest drop at almost 
16 percent. Mazda had a 5 1/2 percent decline.
