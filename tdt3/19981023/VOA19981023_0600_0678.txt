United Nations officials say more than 120,000 people in war-torn 
South Sudan are now contending with unusually heavy rains and flooding. 
The weather disaster comes at a time when the region is already suffering 
from famine. Sonya Lawrence Green reports from Nairobi. sonya lawrence 
green, voa The U.N. World Food Program says that the situation in 
parts of South Sudan is very grave. Flooding in three areas has destroyed 
crops and dealt another blow to thousands of people already in the 
grip of famine. World Food Program Spokeswoman Lindsey Davies says 
Baralcazar region has been hit hard. The river Jure bursts its banks 
and towns like Ajit and Pensau are heavily flooded. Ajit was the epicenter 
of a recent famine. Just a few months ago, some 120 people a day were 
dying from starvation there. Aid agencies only recently brought the 
famine under control, reducing the death toll to eight per day. But 
the 46,000 people in Ajit are still weak and vulnerable. They have 
no crops, no land, no shelter. Ms. Davies says just as aid agencies 
were beginning to see small signs of improvement, they have been set 
back to square one now with the flooding. Another 80,000 people in 
Bor, along the white Nile are in danger now, too, from the worst flooding 
in the area in 10 years. Ms. Davies says aerial surveillance shows 
that 70 percent of crops are damaged or destroyed. She says people 
are trying to move eastward to higher ground, but fighting in the 
area has made the situation worse. A third area hit hard by floods 
in Gumriak in Upper Nile province, where half the crops are now destroyed. 
Up to 1 million people in South Sudan have lost their lives during 
a brutal 15-year civil war, killed by fighting or resulting famine. 
Southern rebels are fighting the Northern Arabized government, trying 
to win more autonomy and religious freedom for the south. But the 
war has, more or less, become a stalemate, with neither side gaining 
the upper hand. Sonya Lawrence Green for VOA News, East Africa bureau.
