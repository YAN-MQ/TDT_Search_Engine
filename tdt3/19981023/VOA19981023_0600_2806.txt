Finally, researchers at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico may have come up with the ultimate device to foil computer 
hackers. It is probably the world's smallest combination lock, a series 
of six code wheels, each less than 300 microns in diameter. The entire 
device measures less than 9 x 5 millimeters, about the size of a button 
on your shirt. These tiny tumblers can be set for any one of a million 
possible entry combinations. Hit the wrong one and access is denied. 
The lock is not software, but an actual part of the computer's hardware 
system and therefore very difficult to break through. The six tiny 
gears and code wheels and their drives will be put onto a silicon 
chip and could be incorporated into any computer. Hackers, you've 
met your match.
