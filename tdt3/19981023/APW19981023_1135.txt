Vlasic to introduce 'world's largest pickle' CHERRY HILL, New Jersey 
(AP) _ Vlasic Foods International plans to introduce a giant pickle 
that it claims is the world's largest: 10 times larger than an ordinary 
pickle. The chip-shaped pickle measures 16 inches (41 centimeters) 
long and 3 inches (8 centimeters) in diameter and will cover an entire 
hamburger, guaranteeing a pickle piece in every bite, Vlasic said 
Monday. The company spent the past four years developing the new pickle, 
``Hamburger Stackers.'' The pickle is made from specially cultivated 
cucumbers grown by the Cherry-Hill based food giant. Vlasic spokesman 
Kevin Lowery said cucumbers used for the pickles were specially grown 
for size, taste and crispness. Cucumbers that size grown with traditional 
methods would have the texture of a watermelon and would not be ideal 
for making pickles, he said. The pickle was secretly developed under 
the code name, ``Project Frisbee.'' It was the brainchild of Frank 
Meczkowski, who created Vlasic's ``Sandwich Stackers,'' a broad flat 
pickle, in 1995. Only 3 percent of the 35 billion sandwiches consumed 
at home each year have a pickle, Vlasic estimates. However, two-thirds 
of all pickles are consumed with a sandwich. This time Vlasic is targeting 
hamburger consumers. The company estimates Americans eat 3.5 billion 
hamburgers annually. The product has a ``peck of pickle profit potential,'' 
Lowery said. The company estimates it could generate at least dlrs 
20 million in sales annually. Hamburger Stackers will sell for dlrs 
2.99 and will be available in two varieties: dill and bread and butter. 
The new pickles will hit retail shelves next week. ___ Use facts from
