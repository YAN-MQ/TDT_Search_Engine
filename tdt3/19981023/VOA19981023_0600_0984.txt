A racist serial killer has been sentenced to life in prison for shooting 
to death two black teenagers in the state of Ohio. A judge in Cincinnati, 
Ohio imposed the life sentence of a Joseph Paul Franklin for murdering 
two black youths in 1980. However, Franklin will return to prison 
in Missouri to await execution for the 1977 killing of a Jewish man. 
Franklin has been linked to 18 murders during the 1970s and `80s across 
the United States in an effort to trigger a race war.
