National Basketball Association players are showing unified support 
behind their union and its fight against team owners over the way 
they are paid. After player met for nearly five hours in a closed 
meeting Thursday in Las Vegas Nevada, they agreed to stand behind 
union demands not to accept a hard salary cap for NBA teams. Superstars, 
like Charles Barclay of the Houston Rockets, said they are also supporting 
players who do not make as much money playing basketball. If we were 
going to break, I think we would have broke before now. You know, 
because I think none of these guys have ever been in a situation where 
we've missed a start of the season and I think that does disturb some 
guys, but I'll just let you know that we're in this. The players have 
been locked out of NBA practice facilities since July, while team 
owners are trying to convince them to accept salary caps. The league 
argues too many of its teams are losing money because of escalating 
payrolls. The players want to earn what the market will allow. The 
standoff has forced the cancellation of the first two weeks of the 
regular season that was to have opened next month. Players and owners 
have not met since October 13th.
