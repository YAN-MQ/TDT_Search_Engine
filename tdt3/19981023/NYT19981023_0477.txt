Ellington Capital Management, the hedge fund firm in Old Greenwich, 
Conn., that was forced to sell many of its holdings to meet margin 
calls earlier this month, told its investors on Friday that the losses 
in its three funds, while sizable, appeared to be limited. By selling 
nearly $2 billion of its holdings over the last two weeks, the firm 
appears to have been able to meet all its margin calls. The funds 
are also said to have significantly reduced the amount they borrow, 
leaving them less vulnerable to any further market downturns. The 
firm _ run by Michael Vranos, who had been a star mortgage bond trader 
at Kidder, Peabody _ was among several hedge fund companies that have 
been rocked by the recent turbulence in the bond markets. When the 
value of their mortgage-related securities fell sharply in mid-October, 
Ellington received margin calls from its lenders and was forced to 
unload hundreds of millions of dollars of its holdings in a two-day 
period. The funds have had losses that are said to average around 
25 percent so far this month, but Ellington seems to have successfully 
stabilized. ``We are pleased that the actions we took were effective 
in protecting our investors' capital,'' said David Bailin, the firm's 
executive vice president.
