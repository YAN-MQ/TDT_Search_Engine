I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." We 
check temperatures today, which continue to be quite mild back through 
the plains. Still cool in the northeast, though, with highs in the 
40s and the 50s, and a little on the cool side most areas in the southeast. 
Forecast weather map shows high pressure continues to dominate the 
weather over much of the east as that high builds in. We'll see the 
cooler temperatures in another cold night tonight in the southeast. 
Do have a front approaching the northwest. That'll move onshore and 
bring showers into the northwest and as far south as San Francisco 
during the day tomorrow. A look now at the extended forecast on Sunday, 
rain and windy conditions will continue to move into the intermountain 
west. We're looking for a few showers in the upper midwest and warmer 
temperatures into the southeast. On Monday, again, mild temperatures 
in the southeast. A little on the cool side in the northeast, with 
highs in the 40s and the 50s. Scattered showers will continue to affect 
a good part of the southwest. On Tuesday, much the same story as temperatures 
warm along the gulf coast. For more weather information, including 
four-day forecasts now available for 7,200 cities, log into CNN.com.
