Republican Party fund raising has exceeded the Democrats' by more 
than $110 million in the current congressional campaign, and in a 
year that campaign finance reform faltered in Congress, unregulated 
donations to both parties more than doubled from the 1994 congressional 
elections. Filings that arrived at the Federal Election Commission 
on Thursday, as the congressional races move into the final days, 
show that, as of Sept. 30, combined donations to all national party 
committees have risen by more than 50 percent from the same date in 
1994: Republican committees have raised $284 million, compared with 
$185 million in 1994; Democrats have raised $174 million, compared 
with $111 million. With the gap between Republican and Democratic 
party fund raising growing to more than $100 million, up from $70 
million in the 1994 election, Democrats have been forced to pursue 
a more bare-bones campaign as the election nears, while Republicans 
are about to embark on a $25 million advertising blitz in crucial 
congressional races. ``Money is an important issue, and we've had 
a lot of money against us,'' said Democratic National Committee chairman 
Roy Romer. ``A lot of money will be pushed out in the last days. They 
have a history of money on their side.'' Money raised by national 
party committees is used primarily to promote congressional candidates 
and is in addition to money the candidates raise themselves. A large 
portion of the national money is unrestricted, or ``soft money,'' 
donations, long criticized by campaign finance reformers as a way 
of supporting candidates outside of federal spending limits. Efforts 
to outlaw soft money, which is supposed to finance party expenses 
like polling, television advertisements and mailings, and is not given 
directly to candidates, failed in Congress in the face of strong opposition 
by the Republican majority in the Senate. Particularly striking in 
the current report is the sharp growth in soft-money donations to 
both parties. Soft money donations to both parties rose by $100 million 
in this election cycle, compared with the 1994 election. Republican 
soft money donations rose to $100 million from $35 million in 1994, 
while Democratic soft money donations reached $76 million, compared 
with $40 million in 1994. ``The critical money in the 1998 congressional 
races is the soft money being spent by the congressional party committees 
on phony issue ads,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 
21, a nonprofit group that advocates the overhauling of campaign finance 
laws. ``This clearly violates existing federal regulations, and it 
is the soft money that is finding its way directly into campaigns.'' 
It has been a tough fund-raising year for Democrats. The Democratic 
National Committee, wracked by a campaign finance scandal and the 
heavy legal bills it generated, raised $97 million since the beginning 
of the election cycle on Jan. 1, 1997. This year the party faced a 
$15 million debt from the campaign finance scandal, along with $12 
million in legal fees. That debt has been whittled to $8 million. 
By contrast, the Republican National Committee has raised $131 million 
to date. Moreover, other party committees raising money specifically 
for Democratic House and Senate candidates have raised about half 
of what Republican counterpart committees have raised: $85 million 
for the Democrats, compared with $151 million for the Republicans. 
``We're in enough races to get our message out,'' said Matt Angle, 
executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, 
which raises money for House races. ``We can't close the gap financially. 
But we think we have enough. '' A party committee set up to help Republican 
Senate candidates is taking in $300,000 a day, and a fund-raiser it 
sponsored a few weeks ago to celebrate the Republican Senate majority 
took in $7 million. The committee, which has a budget of $75 million 
to be used for Republican Senate candidates, has spent more than $5 
million in television ads on top of the $25 million planned by a Republican 
House fund-raising committee for its candidates. Mary Crawford, a 
spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, a 
fund-raising committee for House candidates, said they have directed 
money to nearly 90 House races, both in direct donations as well as 
in soft dollar support. ``On any given year, the competitive playing 
field is around 100 seats. But it's gotten bigger closer to the election,'' 
she said. ``The Clinton scandal has put more Democratic seats in play 
than before.''
