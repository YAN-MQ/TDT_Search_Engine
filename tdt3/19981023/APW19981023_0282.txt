Boris Yeltsin said Friday that Russia was starting to ``crawl out'' 
of its economic crisis and he called for better relations with lawmakers 
who have often quarreled with the president. Yeltsin, who has spent 
most of the past two weeks at a country residence recovering from 
a respiratory infection, was in the Kremlin on Friday for talks with 
Yegor Stroyev, the chairman of parliament's upper house, the Federation 
Council. ``The situation is difficult, but we are starting to crawl 
out a bit,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. 
The Russian economy is not experiencing the daily shocks that it suffered 
when the crisis hit with full force in August, but the economic prognosis 
is still grim. Already high prices continue to rise, millions of Russians 
are out of work and millions more get paid months late. Yeltsin has 
made only occasional comments on the crisis and the new government 
led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has focused only on stop-gap 
measures to stabilize the economy and has not produced a long-term 
recovery plan. Yeltsin and Stroyev discussed payments of overdue wages, 
the development of an anti-crisis program and cooperation between 
the Cabinet, Central Bank and parliament, Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry 
Yakushkin said. Meanwhile, Yeltsin's latest illness has prompted his 
many critics to again question his fitness to govern. Yeltsin, 67, 
has suffered health problems for years, including heart bypass surgery 
in 1996. The president has fought constantly with the lower house 
of parliament, the State Duma, where Communists make up the largest 
faction. The Duma plans to consider a bill that would require Yeltsin's 
chief doctor to report to parliament on the state of the president's 
health. Debates on the bill have been scheduled for November, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Stroyev criticized the bill during 
the meeting with Yeltsin, saying the interest in the president's health 
``should not be brought to the level of the absurd.'' The president 
has had far better relations with the upper house, which usually supports 
Yeltsin. However, nearly half the Federation Council supported a non-binding 
resolution last week that called on the president to resign. But Yeltsin 
said he was still on good terms with Stroyev. ``I like working with 
him,'' Yeltsin told reporters before the meeting with Stroyev. ``We 
work in a friendly way.'' Yeltsin insists that he will serve out the 
final two years of his term and denies speculation that he has serious 
health problems. The president also touched upon the situation in 
Kosovo, saying Friday that it remained ``difficult.'' He reiterated 
Russia's intention to ``achieve a political settlement'' of the conflict 
in the Yugoslavian province, Yakushkin said.
