The justice department went to court today to try to keep northwest 
airlines from buying a controlling stake in continental airlines. 
The justice department says the purchase would reduce competition, 
raise ticket prices and hurt service. Under the proposed deal, the 
airlines say they would keep separate names but combine routes and 
frequent-flyer programs. The justice department is treating the alliance 
as a merger. Northwestern and continental call the suit groundless.
