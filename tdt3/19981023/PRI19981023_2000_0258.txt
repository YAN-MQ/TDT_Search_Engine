More than a million New Yorkers lined Broadway today for a ticker 
tape parade to celebrate the Yankees' victory in the World Series. 
NPR's Margot Adler reports. Police say there may have been as many 
as three million people at the Yankee parade. There were floats, marching 
bands, and tons of confetti. Daryl Strawberry recovering from cancer 
surgery received thunderous cheers when he passed. El Dukay Hernandez 
the pitcher who defected from Cuba had his FM beside him. They received 
temporary visas to leave Cuba. At a ceremony after the parade, here 
is New York Yankee manager Joe Torray. You know they're going to question 
on where this ball club belongs in the history of baseball. I can 
only say one thing: In my opinion, 125 and 50, these guys are the 
best guys that have ever played the game. New York's Mayor Giuliani 
called the Yankees a team with character. Margot Adler, NPR News, 
New York.
