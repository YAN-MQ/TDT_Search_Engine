The presidents of Moldova, Ukraine and Romania have urged Russia to 
withdraw its troops from a breakaway region in Moldova, an official 
statement said Friday. ``We express our concern ... and plead for 
a peaceful and definitive solution'' to the problems in the Trans-Dniester 
region, said a document signed by the three presidents, who were holding 
a summit meeting. Presidents Petru Lucinschi of Moldova, Leonid Kuchma 
of Ukraine and Emil Constantinescu of Romania said an agreement Thursday 
on trilateral cooperation that expressed their concern about the conflicts 
in the region. The document did not recognize the self-proclaimed 
independence of Trans-Dniester, saying it is a region ``inside the 
territory of an independent, unitary and sovereign Moldova.'' Trans-Dniester, 
a sliver of land in eastern Moldova with a population of 700,000 mainly 
ethnic Slavs, declared independence in 1990 fearing that Moldova, 
dominated by ethnic Romanians, would seek to reunite with neighboring 
Romania. A five-month war between Moldova and the separatists in 1992 
claimed about 700 lives. Fighting ceased after Russia sent in 5,000 
troops. Relations between the government and the separatists remain 
tense. The three presidents expressed their support for a mission 
from the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe as ``an 
instrument to prevent conflicts and solve the crisis.'' Lucinschi, 
Kuchma and Constantinescu signed also an agreement on trilateral cooperation 
against the organized crime and agreed to coordinate efforts against 
the illegal transport of weapons and radioactive materials. Also, 
Moldova and Ukraine signed an agreement that seeks to end a lingering 
dispute over pension payments in the two countries. The countries 
have agreed to pay the pensions of the thousands of people who have 
moved from one country to the other. During the Soviet era, thousands 
of Moldovans and Ukrainians were moved from one republic to another 
for work projects. When the Soviet Union collapsed, many people returned 
to their native lands, but faced difficulties in collecting pensions.
