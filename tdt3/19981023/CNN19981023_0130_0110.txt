Searchers in water-logged areas of Texas have recovered the bodies 
of more victims. The floods have now taken the lives of 28 people. 
Charles Zewe tells us, the danger is not over yet. The Colorado river 
boiled past this antebellum village Thursday, threatening to inundate 
one-quarter of the town 60 miles southwest of houston. Whoa, we gotta 
a big one here. Officials keeping tabs on the river said the Colorado 
was expected to crest Friday at a record level, but below earlier 
predictions. That meant Wharton's business district would stay dry. 
But in a low-income section of town known as "the end," residents 
who don't have much, lost what little they had. Authorities in airboats 
urged residents to leave, as water relentlessly seeped into the neighborhood, 
flooding dozens of homes and an elementary school. Residents here 
have been nervously watching the flood build since torrential rains 
hit central Texas last weekend. They've been devastated. A lot of 
these folks are -- lose a lot of what they own. Within hours, those 
who failed to heed warnings to get out were trapped. I've been here 
all my life. Others, like 4-year-old IRA Mae Anderson, were just stubborn. 
I want to stay here so I be more calmer. Anderson waved off rescuers 
even as flood waters submerged the front steps of her home. Eventually, 
emergency workers brought in the woman's nurse and best friend, bessie, 
who talked her out. And then Anderson, wearing a pink bed coat and 
earmuffs, got her first air boat ride. Why did you decide to come 
out now? She said she would kill me if I hadn't. Are you glad you 
came out then? Yeah, I'm tired of worrying Y'all. There you go. Anderson 
will stay with friends until the flood recedes. Like her neighbors, 
she's unsure what she'll find when she goes home again. Officials 
say that probably won't happen for several days. Charles Zewe, CNN, 
Wharton, Texas.
