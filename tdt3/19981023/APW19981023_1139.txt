Heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield said Friday that Mike Tyson 
is not in his boxing future right now. However, Holyfield acknowledged 
that could change if fans want a rematch. Tyson got back the license 
taken from him for biting Holyfield's ears in a championship fight 
15 months ago. Holyfield again said the Nevada Athletic Commission 
decision this week was the right one, but added, ``I can't say he 
learned his lesson; time tells that.'' Holyfield, the WBA and IBF 
champion, said he expected to unify the title when he fights WBC titleholder 
Lennox Lewis in late February or early March. ``Then, I would be the 
undisputed champ of the world. I guess after that I would see how 
bad the people want me to fight Mike Tyson,'' Holyfield said. Holyfield 
said having another Tyson fight would not be decided by how much he 
might want a rematch. ``I've already beat him twice. So, it's not 
how bad I want to beat him, but how bad the people want me to fight 
him,'' he said. Holyfield said Lewis is ``the wanted man now.'' ``We're 
both on contract to fight. The people will get an opportunity to see 
who is really the best,'' Holyfield said. Holyfield said he will continue 
to fight as long as he does well. The 35-year-old champion was in 
Jackson with Florida attorney Willie Gary to present computers and 
a dlrs 100,000 check to the Mississippi Schools for the Deaf and Blind. 
Kenneth Carpenter, a 16-year-old wrestler on the School for the Deaf 
team, told Holyfield he was ready to fight him. ``I'll be free in 
December,'' the youth told the incredulous Holyfield while getting 
an autograph. He looked over the teen-ager, who stood about chest 
high to Holyfield, and said, ``You really want to fight me? I'll think 
about it.''
