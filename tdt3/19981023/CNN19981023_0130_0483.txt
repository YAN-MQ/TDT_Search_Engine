The tobacco industry has a different kind of class-action suit to 
deal with now. Black smokers and two black health groups are suing 
because they say the industry violated civil rights statutes by trying 
to get black people to smoke menthol cigarettes. The plaintiffs claim 
menthols are more toxic than regular cigarettes, and 70% of menthol 
smokers are black. The suit claims blacks are 30% more likely to die 
from smoking-related illnesses than whites.
