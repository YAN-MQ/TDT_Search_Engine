For another star player today, Orlando "El duque" Hernandez was reunited 
with the family he left behind in cue da 10 months ago when he escaped 
by raft to the U.S. Fidel Castro allowed the family to take off on 
a small jet for a visit after a personal plea from Cardinal O'Connor. 
Rehema Ellis has the story. This is how it looks when a fairy tale 
comes true. Orlando "El duque" Hernandez, a baseball hero reunited 
with his mother and two daughters, the family he never thought he'd 
say again. El duque! Today, he's on top of the world. It's especially 
sweet considering how far he's come. In cue da, El duque was the best 
his country had, a dominating pitcher and national hero, but he was 
banned from the game two years ago and living on just $8 a monthecause 
his brother, also a star baseball player, defected to the United States. 
He had no hope of turning his life around, so he escaped, making his 
way to the U.S. by a small sailboat, leaving his family behind. After 
spending time at a detension camp, an emotional meeting in Miami with 
his brother, now a player with the Florida Marlins. El duque was destined 
for glory in the major leagues, too, a baseball who once worked for 
pennies a day, now has a $6 million contract with the best team in 
the game, the New York Yankees. To make it better, he needed one more 
wish. For that, he called on New York's John Cardinal O'Connor. The 
Cardinal immediately petitioned Castro, and within hours, the request 
was granted. It's temporary visitor's visa for them to come and visit 
with their father in the New York and be there for the parade and 
festivities. El duque got the news on Wednesday, the night the Yankees 
won the world series. It was tremendous. He was jumping up and down 
in the corridor. People were looking at him. He didn't care. "They're 
coming!" That's all he said. Flying above George Steinbrenner's private 
plane, his family arrived. El duque made it to America finding fame 
and fortune. He had everything he wanted except his family to share 
it with. Now he has that too for a bhile. Rehema Ellis, NBC news, 
New York.
