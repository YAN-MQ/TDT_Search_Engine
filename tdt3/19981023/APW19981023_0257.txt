Englishman Justin Rose had a disappointing introduction to Australia 
when he missed the cut in the Aust dlrs 500,000 (U.S. dlrs 316,000) 
Ford South Australian Open on Friday. Rose, who turned professional 
earlier this year after finishing equal fourth in the British Open, 
added a 76 to his opening round 77 for 153. The cut was at 150, 12 
shots behind halfway leader Nathan Green. The Australian, playing 
his first tournament as a professional, shot a second 69 on the par-72 
Kooyonga Golf Club course for 138. Green led Matthew King by a shot 
with German Open champion Stephen Allan giving Australia the top three 
spots at 4-under. ``Coming in I was just trying to make the cut, it's 
just a big bonus to be where I am now,'' Green said. ``I'm very nervous, 
I'm a little uncomfortable, I have never been near this sort of situation, 
it's my first time as a pro.'' There were seven players at 141 including 
Robin Byrd of the United States and New Zealander Simon Owen. Frenchman 
Jean-Louis Guepy added a 71 to his first-round 71 to be six off the 
pace.
