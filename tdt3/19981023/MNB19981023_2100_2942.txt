With less than a week to go before senator John Glenn's second flight 
into space, we've been hearing a lot about his upcoming mission, including 
questions about whether it's more of a P.R. boost for NASA than real 
science. Here is Tom Brokaw's interview with John Glenn from tonight's 
nightly news. Senator, how old are you on your driver's license? 77. 
How old are you in your mind and in your heart? Good question. I guess 
I've never gone with a calendar, Tom. I think you're as old as you 
feel you are. Getting old without giving into it is part of what drives 
John Glenn. 56 years after he first trained to be a Marine pilot in 
world war II. One of my neighbors says she doesn't want to burn out, 
she wants to rust out. For Glenn, shuttle training is a test. Can 
he still meet the physical and mental demands? Are you finding, with 
all due respect, that you're as quick in the mind as you were a few 
years ago? I think as quick in the mind, yes. But I'm not as up to 
speed, for instance, I'm not as much into the computers. Training 
improves technical gaps, but there's the larger question of the right 
stuff. Glenn proved he had it in the early 1960's, as one of NASA's 
original mercury 7 astronauts, brave enough to risk his life flying 
an experimental rocket that was unproven. Nothing is 100% safe. NASA's 
had an amazing record. By comparison, today's shuttles are reliable 
laboratories for silence. Safe enough for his wife? Did she look at 
you this sime and say, come on, enough? When I first started talking 
about this, she was rather cool to the whole idea. But the more she's 
learned about this, she's switched around and become very excited 
about it. For Glenn, there is the rich memory and the anticipation 
of the thrill of liftoff. There'll be the same kind of rush. Back 
on earth, gln is about to retire from his second calling, 24 years 
as U.S. senator from Ohio. After the shuttle, he will open a public 
policy center. He hopes to change the minds of cynical young people 
who want nothing to do with government or politics. We can't have 
dwindling numbers and apathy, or our cunfri will go downhill. Are 
you at an age when you're supposed to be bouncing grandchildren on 
your knee? They're so big now I can't bounce them anymore, Tom. You 
might as well go fly in space. And see if I can't learn something 
new. It's thrilling to learn new things that may benefit other people.
