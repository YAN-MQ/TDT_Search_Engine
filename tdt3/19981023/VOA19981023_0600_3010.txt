The Clinton administration is using financial incentives to pressure 
oil companies to build a Caspian Sea oil pipeline along a U.S.-backed 
route. The United States will give more than $800,000 to Anchora to 
help fund the planning for Turkey's part of the proposed pipeline. 
Voa's Chalise McDonough reports. Undersecretary of State Stewart Eisenstat 
has announced an $823,000 grant to shore up plans for a proposed Caspian 
Oil pipeline through Turkey. The money from the U.S. Trade and Development 
Agency, will fund technical assistance and planning for a pipeline 
route that the U.S. favors. An agency spokeswoman says the grant agreement 
scheduled to be signed in Turkey Tuesday. She says it will also cover 
financial and environmental planning and legal matters for the pipeline 
proposal. There are several routes proposed for getting oil to world 
market from the Caspian Sea region. The Clinton Administration has 
been pushing for a route to the Mediterranean Sea from the Azerbaijani 
capital of Baku. The pipeline would pass through Armenia to the Turkish 
city of Jahan. But oil companies have complained that route is too 
expensive. With an estimated cost of between $2 billion and $4 billion. 
Other proposed destinations include two ports on the Black Sea, on 
in Georgia, the other in Russia. The United States prefers the Turkish 
route because of civil conflict in Georgia and instability in Russia's 
Southern Caucus region. In spite of uncertainty over the oil company's 
pending decision, the Turkish government has expressed confidence 
that the Baku Jahan pipeline will be built. Prime Minister Mesut Iomars 
in Encara Thursday said he thinks the interested parties will reach 
a final agreement soon. The leaders of four of the region's oil-rich 
nations, Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, Georgia and Turkmenistan, are expected 
to travel to Encara at the end of the month to discuss the issue. 
They're expected to announce their support for the Baku Jahan route 
on October 29th at celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Turkish 
Republic. Chalis McDonough, VOA News, Washington.
