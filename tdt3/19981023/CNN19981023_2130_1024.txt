The airline industry was deregulated two decades ago in an effort 
to Foster competition. But some people say it didn't work. Stephanie 
Oswald has the story in this "working ahead" report. 20 years after 
airline deregulation, industry critics say major carriers unfairly 
stamp out competition, hogging space at airports, creating fortress 
hubs to control the market and lowering fares and adding flights to 
entice passengers. We've had scorched earth, predatory practices by 
the major carriers. Legislation to rein in carriers is making its 
way through congress. To open up some of these slots to these low-cost 
airlines and also open them up to airlines that will agree to serve 
some of these underserved communities. In April, the department of 
transportation proposed competition guidelines, threatening to impose 
fines on airlines. Where the carrier undercuts the other carrier to 
such an extent that the only reasonable justification for that would 
be to drive out the low cost or new entrant carrier. The airline industry 
says that amounts to reregulation. The result of the guidelines will 
be that airfares are going to go up, not down, that competition is 
going to decrease. Others disagree. Because they will strengthen the 
assurances to competitors, that if they come in, they're not going 
to be slaughtered. But attempts to level the competitive playing field 
hit a Roadblock in Congress earlier this month when plans to add new 
slots at chicago's O'hare airport were tabled, and approval of the 
D.O.T. guidelines has been delayed until next year. If we don't create 
a climate where new entrants can come into the business, then you 
will see a pressure here in Congress to reregulate the airlines. The 
bottom line for consumers is a return to deregulation's original goals 
-- more choices, better service and lower fares. Stephanie Oswald, 
CNN, reporting.
