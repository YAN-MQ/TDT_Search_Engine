Well, we come now to the answer to today's Geography Quiz. Remember, 
we were looking for a national forest with a wide variety or Ecosystems 
that range from desert to sub-Alpine forest. The former home of the 
real Smokey Bear is the Capitan Mountains which lie within the Lincoln 
National Forest in Southern New Mexico. The Lincoln Forest goes right 
up to the New Mexico/Texas line, and from there, it's just a few miles 
to the Mexican border. It was in this part of Texas in the town of 
Sierra LaBlanca that state officials proposed building a dump for 
low-level nuclear waste. As THE WORLD reported earlier this week, 
the government of Mexico opposed the plan, claiming the dump would 
pose a health hazard for hundreds of thousands of people living on 
the Mexican side of the border. The U.S. Senate had approved the plan, 
but yesterday, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission 
voted unanimously against it. The commissioner cited concern over 
a geological fault running beneath the site. Today, Mexican papers 
claim victory on their front pages with headlines like "Red Light 
to Sierra LaBlanca." But the Mexican celebration may be premature. 
Texas officials may yet appeal the decision to kill the project.
