Skiers at the 2000 World Cup ski finals in Bormio, Italy, will have 
to share the spotlight with former ski racer Pope John Paul II. Gian 
Franco Kasper, president of the International Ski Federation (FIS), 
said Friday that the pope has agreed to include the two-week event 
as part of the Holy Year celebrations. Kasper said the pontiff, who 
used to race as a youngster in Poland, will hand out awards at a prize-giving 
ceremony in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City. ``It's part of the 
Holy Year program that the Pope is involved with this,'' Kasper said. 
``Of course, it will depend on his health. He has also decided to 
be present at the races if his health will allow it.'' As a young 
man, the pope was a licensed racer in Poland. ``He used to be an excellent 
skier and we still have the original of the pope's racing license 
from when he was competing in Poland,'' Kasper said. ``He was still 
skiing 10 years ago. I remember we gave him a pair of skis which were 
very specially made with a cross for the pope because he went skiing 
once or twice a year as far as I know.'' The 2000 World Cup finals 
will include competition in all five World Cup ski circuits _ alpine, 
cross-country, freestyle skiing, nordic-combined and snowboarding. 
The tentative date for the event is March 15-19. It will be the first 
time all five disciplines contest their finals at one event. Until 
now, the different World Cup circuits all organized their own finals. 
The ``mini-Olympics'' will be held every four years when neither the 
Olympic Games nor World Championships are scheduled. The 2000 event 
will be staged in Bormio, Santa Caterina, Livigno and St. Moritz. 
St. Moritz, which will host the Nordic combined, is in Swiss territory 
but less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Bormio.
