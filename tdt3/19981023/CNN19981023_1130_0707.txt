Sometimes it can be hard to find time to catch your breath. Much less 
to work on improving your overall cardiovascular health, but there 
are ways to fit a workout into your busy work schedule. Try riding 
your back to the office or rollerblading. You can use part of your 
lunch hour to get exercise. If you travel with your job, you may want 
to add a miniworkout to your hotel stay. Many hotels have pools and 
exercise facilities. But if you're running short on time, use a jumprope 
to get your heart the rate up in your room. If you don't want to pack 
extras try jogging in place. Check out CNN.com/health for the latest 
health news on line. Christy lawsen, "Headline News."
