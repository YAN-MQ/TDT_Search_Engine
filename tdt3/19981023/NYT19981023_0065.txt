A few years ago, when my sister-in-law Lee was turning 40, she made 
this announcement: ``I plan to retire on Dec. 31, 1999. I will not 
work in the next century.'' It was a bold remark. But ever since, 
much as a bird builds its nest one twig at a time, Lee has been methodically 
laying the foundations for her future life _ retirement that would 
begin long before 50. She left the large firm where she was one of 
many in-house lawyers, started her own law firm in Washington, wrote 
a legal reference book that promises a long stream of income and taught 
her sharp young hires how to run the firm and land new clients. She 
got into stocks and mutual funds early in the bull market and stayed 
with them. She has been relentless, and I'm confident that when the 
millennium comes, there will indeed be one less person practicing 
law in Washington. My sister-in-law, of course, is not alone. Plenty 
of people have subdued the economic monsters of living expenses, their 
children's college educations and retirement savings and realized 
that they don't have to wait until they are in their 60s to call it 
quits. And they are all not chief executives or Wall Street whizzes. 
Many, like Lee, are smart people who had a plan and simply stuck with 
it. One of the fantasies of middle age is having the chance to enjoy 
it. We have worked hard, and the thought that we will have to toil 
for 10 or 20 more years before claiming our reward can be depressing. 
I know that I would love to wrap up my career in about 10 years, when 
I'm 56, but I also know that I probably won't be able to afford to. 
Katy Hollister, a partner with the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; 
Touche in Cincinnati, says she hears talk of early retirement all 
the time, as more and more clients chase the dream. Recently, she 
had to give a lesson in economic reality to a group of workers at 
a factory in the Southwest after dozens of them, having seen the value 
of their 401(k) plans jump, began considering such a move. The reality 
is this: You have to start planning early and saving early. And you 
have to understand that if you retire when you are, say, 50, you might 
need to finance a retirement that will last as many years as your 
working life. Figuring out how to pay our children's college costs 
is scary enough, but as Ms. Hollister pointed out, ``There are no 
scholarships for retirement.'' That doesn't worry someone else who 
is planning an early retirement _ a 41-year-old consultant in Manhattan 
who is married with two children. He started making his retirement 
plans when he was 33 and wants to have about $5 million in assets 
by the time he's 50, when he plans to retire. And he says he will 
achieve his goal. ``It takes financial discipline,'' said the consultant, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``You have to approach saving 
like you would paying a mortgage.'' He lives frugally, owning two 
older cars and a modest house, and pours much of his and his wife's 
salaries into a combination of stocks, bonds and real estate. ``It's 
all about financial independence,'' he said. ``It just means that 
at 50, I want to have flexibility. I don't want to have to have a 
job to make ends meet.'' Lee, who is married and has no children, 
also decided to forgo a grand house; instead, she invested the money 
she would have paid in higher mortgage payments into the stock market. 
``I've been in Washington 16 years, and I still live in a condo,'' 
she said. ``I haven't had huge housing expenses.'' She also decided 
that she could earn a lot more by working for herself, in her own 
law practice. ``That took the cap off my income level,'' she said. 
``It also eliminated debt from my life.'' I asked Ms. Hollister how 
much I would need to retire in 10 years and still put my four children 
through college. She ran my numbers through her computer. Her short 
answer: $2.1 million. Her somewhat longer answer: Forget it, you'll 
never make it. But maybe some people can. Ms. Hollister offered a 
rough formula to find out. First, assume that your retirement will 
begin in 10 years and last for 30 years, that your investments will 
earn a 4 percent real, or inflation-adjusted, annual return and that 
inflation will be a steady 4 percent a year. To estimate how much 
you'll need in savings on the day you retire, multiply your current 
annual expenses by 26.6 _ a number she derived in complex calculations 
from the assumptions above, based on the present and future value 
of money. If, for example, you have $100,000 a year in expenses, you 
will need to set aside $2.66 million to join my sister-in-law _ who, 
by the way, doesn't plan to just lie on the beach. To her, retiring 
early means having the freedom to make her next move without economic 
pressure. ``I don't want to retire early so I can stop doing what 
I am doing,'' Lee said. ``I want to retire early so I can start doing 
things I am not yet doing. I have the feeling that the ability to 
do new things will diminish if I wait.''
