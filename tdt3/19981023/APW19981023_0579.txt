The Slovene government will invite Pope John Paul II for a second 
visit to the southern Alpine nation, a government spokesman said Friday. 
The government approved Archbishop Edmond Farhat's request to invite 
the pope on Thursday and Foreign Minister Boris Frlec is to officially 
extend the invitation during a visit to the Vatican on Oct. 29, said 
Branko Vidrih, a government spokesman. Relations between the government 
and the Catholic Church in Slovenia have been strained since the country 
gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. The Pope last 
visited Slovenia in May 1996, as part of a tour of the former Yugoslavia.
