Israeli and Palestinian negotiators may be a step closer to reaching 
a Peace agreement. Palestinian representatives say they will remove 
from their charter, a Clause that calls for the destruction of Israel. 
Israel has agreed to transfer 13% of the West Bank to direct Palestinian 
control, in exchange for security promises. U.S. officials say nothing 
is set in stone yet, rather, the current stage of talks are an end 
game to a signable agreement. President Clinton rejoined the talks 
Thursday, but officials are not revealing what, if any, direct role 
he had in the latest apparent breakthrough. He has talked to some 
foreign leaders. He has talked to king Hussein. He has talked to President 
Mubarek. I am not aware. The staff level -- we have been keeping relevant 
members of Congress updated and informed on what's going on here. 
But I am not aware of the president reaching out personally. Israeli 
officials say prime minister Netanyahu has also agreed to release 
some Palestinians in Israeli jails, but not all of them. That and 
the issue of safe passage for Palestinians are the remaining sticking 
points in negotiations.
