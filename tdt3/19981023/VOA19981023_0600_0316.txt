President Clinton has decided not to pay a courtesy visit to Malaysian 
Prime Minister Maha Tir Mohamed, at Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Forum meeting in Malaysia next month. The president would normally 
pay such a visit to the leader of the host country, but U.S. officials 
said that Mr. Clinton will skip the gesture at the meeting to demonstrate 
U.S. concerns about recent political repression in Malaysia. The decision 
is to due to the jailing of former Deputy Prime Minister Amwar Ibrahim 
who has accused police of beating him. I'm Bill Hazard, VOA News.
