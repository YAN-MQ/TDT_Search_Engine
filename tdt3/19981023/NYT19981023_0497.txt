Joining the growing list of elite research universities that are making 
undergraduates a higher priority, Cornell University announced plans 
Friday to transform undergraduate education _ changing everything 
from the way students live to the way they learn. Cornell president 
Hunter Rawlings made the announcement during a major policy address 
to trustees and alumni. It comes as more and more universities _ from 
Duke to Stanford to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology _ respond 
to growing criticism that they have shifted their focus to graduate 
students, often at the expense of underclassmen. ``There is a broadening 
recognition that this needs to be done,'' said Robert Zemsky, director 
of the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the University 
of Pennsylvania. ``But it is not clear that we know how to do it.'' 
Rawlings said he would ask Cornell's trustees to approve investing 
more than $200 million in the coming decade in the changes, which 
are intended to reach from the residence halls to student participation 
in research laboratories. Cornell, in Ithaca, N.Y., has 12,500 undergraduates. 
The university will move all freshmen together on the university's 
north campus, where new buildings will be built to accommodate them. 
Having them together will make it easier ``to weave academic pursuits 
into the fabric of student life'' for the freshmen, the university 
said. Rawlings has asked a committee of students and faculty and staff 
members to develop a plan for a system of residential houses for upper-class 
students, like the house systems at Harvard and Yale, to bring students 
into greater contact with professors. Cornell also announced a campaign 
to raise $200 million in endowment for student financial aid. ``As 
good as we are in undergraduate education, we aim to become even better 
_ in fact, the best research university for undergraduate education 
in this country,'' Rawlings said. ``The new initiatives and financial 
commitment will provide the foundation for that improvement.'' Many 
of the oldest research universities, like Harvard and Yale, started 
life as small undergraduate colleges, centered on nurturing and educating 
their young students. But since World War II, their research activities 
have mushroomed. Faculty members who once involved themselves deeply 
in the lives of their colleges and of their students have increasingly 
become oriented toward their graduate students and professional societies. 
Isaac Kramnick, chairman of Cornell's government department, who will 
head the new committee on reshaping residential life for upperclassmen, 
said that had been the case at Cornell. ``When I came to Cornell in 
1972, faculty meetings were filled,'' he said. ``Now it is sometimes 
hard to get a quorum.'' He said that while he and other faculty members 
still carried the same teaching load, many spent less time advising 
and acting as mentors for students. In many ways, research universities 
have been thriving. Endowments have soared. Applications are reaching 
records. Nonetheless, the universities have increasingly come under 
fire for their preoccupation with research and neglect of undergraduates. 
``A lot of institutions were doing really terrific things, but it 
was hit and miss,'' said Shirley Strum Kenny, the chairwoman of a 
report for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 
last spring that called for an overhaul of undergraduate education 
at universities. ``I think what is happening now, at Cornell and elsewhere, 
is more focus on the totality of the undergraduate experience,'' said 
Ms. Kenny, who is also president of the State University of New York 
at Stony Brook. Rawlings has been trying to make changes in undergraduate 
life throughout his four-year tenure at Cornell, but he said the Carnegie 
report had added impetus. ``We want to be responsive,'' he said. Rawlings, 
however, said that the goal was to build on some programs Cornell 
had in place, like drawing more students into faculty research laboratories, 
where they can become partners in work under way. He said that besides 
creating opportunities for more faculty-student interaction in the 
residence halls, he wanted to expand on programs like Cornell's Presidential 
Research Scholars Program, in which students conduct paid, part-time 
research with a faculty mentor during their four years on campus. 
``I want to give that some momentum,'' he said.
