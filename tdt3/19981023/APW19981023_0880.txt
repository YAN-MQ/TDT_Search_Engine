New York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez on Friday 
was reunited with the family he hasn't seen since defecting from Cuba 
on a raft 10 months ago. Hernandez's mother, two daughters and ex-wife 
arrived at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey at 2:45 a.m. on the private 
jet of team owner George Steinbrenner. Hernandez and his mother wept 
and hugged each other as friends stood by with bottles of champagne. 
The family arrived just in time for Friday's parade in New York City 
to commemorate the Yankees' World Series victory over the San Diego 
Padres. U.S. State Department officials and others said the family 
left the island with the Cuban government's blessing for what is expected 
to be a brief stay. They changed planes at Miami International Airport 
late Thursday. ``I am very happy that I will be able to see my dad. 
I have missed him,'' said Yahumara, 8, during the stop. She and 2-year-old 
Steffi both wore Yankees T-shirts. ``I'm very happy. I'm very proud 
of my son,'' said Maria Julia Pedroso Cruz, 52. ``He hasn't changed, 
in spite of the fact that he has all that money.'' Since her son left, 
she said, ``it has been very difficult for us, but we have survived 
the situation.'' Hernandez, who signed a four-year dlrs 6.6 million 
contract with the Yankees in March, was banned from playing in Cuba 
for dealing with American Major League Baseball scouts. He fled by 
climbing onto a rickety raft with his wife, Noris Bosch, and six others 
last December. They landed on a remote Bahamian island and were rescued 
by the U.S. Coast Guard. He became a key member of the Yankees pitching 
staff, helping them to a 9-3 victory Sunday in the World Series, which 
New York won in a sweep of San Diego on Wednesday night. Hernandez 
asked Cardinal John O'Connor for help in bringing his family in from 
Cuba, said Joe Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese 
of New York. The cardinal sent a message to Cuban President Fidel 
Castro on behalf of the player. The Cuban ambassador to the United 
Nations called O'Connor late Wednesday and said the visit was approved, 
Zwilling said. The cardinal called Steinbrenner during the first inning 
of Wednesday's game to give him the news, and the owner arranged the 
plane ride. Hernandez's half-brother, Livan, also played baseball 
in Cuba and defected during a team trip to Mexico in 1995. He was 
the 1997 World Series most valuable player for the Florida Marlins 
and his mother was allowed to fly from Cuba to Miami to visit him 
just before Game 7. Juan Iglesias, Livan Hernandez's agent, said he 
didn't know anything about the latest Hernandez family visit, only 
that ``El Duque'' was planning to fly to Miami after Friday's parade 
to visit his brother.
