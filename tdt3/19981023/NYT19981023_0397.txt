There they were, the heroes of the 1998 World Champion New York Yankees, 
depicted in their uniforms on baseball-card-style posters hung prominently 
across the facade of City Hall: O'Neill. Wells. Hernandez. Giuliani. 
Giuliani? Was he that scrappy backup shortstop? Or maybe that middle 
reliever, the one called in to strike out lefties? Whoever he is, 
he must be important. His poster was smack in the center of every 
camera angle, right next to the manager, Joe Torre, while posters 
of better-known players were relegated to the fringes of the display, 
including Andy Pettitte, the pitcher who merely won the fourth and 
final game of the World Series. Of course, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
is neither a player nor coach for the Yankees, despite his penchant 
for wearing pinstripes. But he was the host of the city's exuberant 
celebration for the Yankees Friday, and his aides made sure that he 
was duly recognized as the team's No. 1 fan in some of the posters 
and banners plastered on walls, railings and anything else that did 
not have a pulse in City Hall Park. Such self-promotional touches 
might be expected at a baseball party thrown by a politician, but 
the challenge is in striking the proper balance in emphasis. One City 
Council member, Stephen DiBrienza of Brooklyn, found it all just a 
bit too much. ``It's like Rudy's private party,'' he said, motioning 
to the balloons-and-barricades celebration that had transformed a 
workday Friday in lower Manhattan into something closer to a Mardi 
Gras bacchanal. It did seem at times that politicians were threatening 
to steal the spotlight from the Yankee players, coaches and executives. 
On the dais facing the cameras and the crowd of 5,000 people, elected 
officials took up most of the first-row seats, while the players sat 
in the second and third rows. If you wanted to see Scott Brosius, 
the third-baseman and World Series hero, you had to peer around some 
guy in a Yankee warm-up jacket, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. Also in a Yankee 
jacket was Gov. George Pataki, who jokingly demonstrated the powers 
of his office by presenting vanity license plates to certain Yankees.
