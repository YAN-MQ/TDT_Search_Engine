Greek Orthodox clerics are demanding the return of the only known 
copy of a text by the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes due to be 
auctioned next week, Greece's culture ministry said Friday. But if 
the manuscript's current holders _ a French family _ do not return 
the 1,000-year-old copy, the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem would 
consider taking legal measures, Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos 
said. ``According to the Jerusalem Patriarchate, the manuscript has 
been stolen,'' Venizelos said. An auction for the 174-leaf text has 
been set for Oct. 29 at Christie's in New York. It includes transcriptions 
of writings on geometry and physics by the 3rd century BC theoretician 
and inventor. Christie's anticipated it could fetch between dlrs 800,000 
to dlrs 1.2 million. A Christie's spokeswoman said the auction date 
has not been affected by the Patriarchate's claim. ``As far as I know, 
the sale will take place as scheduled because Christie's continues 
to be satisfied that the consignor has a legitimate title and right 
to sell,'' Vredy Lytsman told The Associated Press. But the auction 
house has said it would call off the sale if there was proof that 
the manuscript was not legitimately owned by the French holders. Venizelos 
originally appealed to several Greek groups and businesses to pool 
funds to bid on the text. But then questions were raised the ownership 
of the manuscript, which was lost when the Patriarchate's library 
was transferred to Athens from Constantinople _ now Istanbul _ after 
World War I. It had been housed earlier in Orthodox monasteries in 
Palestine. If the Jerusalem Patriarchate can prove its ownership, 
the manuscript _ known as the Archimedes Palimpsest _ will be housed 
in Athens' National Library, Venizelos said. A palimpsest is a manuscript 
whose pages have been written on twice. When writing materials were 
in short supply, the original text would be washed away when no longer 
deemed useful. A U.S. lawyer for the Jerusalem Patriarchate, Simos 
Dimas, drafted a letter to Christie's to demand the manuscript's return, 
Venizelos said. Christie's has not released the name of the family 
that placed the text up for auction. According to a statement by Felix 
de Marez Oyens, the head of the auction house's Books and Manuscripts 
Department, Christie's is satisfied it ``has been legitimately owned 
by a French family for the last three-quarters of a century.'' If 
the auction goes ahead, the Greek government will bid for it, Venizelos 
stresses. ``If the outcome is negative for legal issues _ because 
historically and morally, there is no doubt that the Patriarchate 
is right _ of course we will return to our efforts of purchasing this 
manuscript,'' he said.
