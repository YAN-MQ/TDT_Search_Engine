TIRANA, Albania (AP)- The chief of a criminal gang in a small town 
was blown up Thursday by a rival gang. His head was put on a tray 
and toured around town, local media reported Friday. Police sources 
confirmed the killing and identified the victim as Artur Daja, 31, 
allegedly the head of one of the two biggest criminal gangs in the 
town of Lushnja, 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Tirana. Local media 
reported that Daja was dragged under a bridge outside town and bombed 
to death. His head, on a tray, was taken to all the families of the 
victims Daja had allegedly killed. Since last year, when Albania exploded 
in chaos after the collapse of pyramid schemes in which many Albanians 
lost their life savings, the ``law of an eye for an eye'' rules in 
most of the country. Rival gangs in many towns demand money from businesmen 
for protection and fight each other for spheres of influence. Despite 
the efforts of the Socialist-led government to establish order and 
the rule of law, crime remains high. About a million guns remain in 
the hands of the people and are often used to administer ``personal 
justice.'' In Lushnja, most people emptied the streets after the incident, 
media said. Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said police had 
identified the killers and were searching for them.
