South African Wayne Ferreira pulled off the biggest shock so far in 
the dlrs 750,000 Lyon Grand Prix on Friday when he beat No. 2 seed 
Patrick Rafter, 6-4, 6-1. Unseeded Ferreira, who beat Pete Sampras 
two weeks ago in Basel, never looked back after breaking Rafter's 
serve in the first game of the match. In the second set, he raced 
to a 4-0 lead and continued to hit winner after winner to gain a victory 
in one hour and ten minutes. Rafter hit too many unforced errors and 
displayed unusually patchy serving against Ferreira, the 1995 Lyon 
champion. Ferreira, 27, had won four of the players' previous seven 
meetings, including all three that were played on carpet. ''When you 
play Patrick you know that he is going to come to the net,'' the South 
African said. ''But I hit some great passing shots and was very happy 
with my form.'' Ferreira, currently ranked 29, said he is getting 
back to his best form after a serious ankle injury sustained last 
year. Following Rafter's elimination and Sampras' withdrawal because 
of a back injury, Marcelo Rios is favorite to take the Lyon title. 
No. 3 seed Rios proved much too strong for 19-year-old French wildcard 
Arnaud Di Pasquale, winning 6-4, 6-0. Roared on by a partisan crowd, 
world junior champion Di Pasquale competed well in the first set, 
but the Chilean's dogged baseline game soon proved too much for the 
Frenchman, who lost in 59 minutes. ''I started a bit sloppily and 
wasn't serving too well but I played better in the second set,'' Rios 
said after the match. Rios, who has only played Sampras once, said 
that he hadn't thought about facing the world No. 1. ''Injury is part 
of the game and I just think one match at a time,'' he said. In the 
semifinal, Rios will instead take on Germany's Tommy Haas, who won 
a walkover after Sampras' withdrawal. In a match of contrasting styles, 
Ferreira will take on Alex Corretja in Saturday's second semifinal.
