A bizarre twist in a Tennessee murder mystery tonight, involving a 
popular state senator, a man who never missed a day of work in 28 
years and dedicated himself to victims rights causes. He was shot 
point blank in the head earlier this week. But now, police in the 
small town of cookeville have made an arrest. The accused is the murdered 
man's political challenger. Is this the ultimate example of hardball 
politics? Here's NBC's fredricka Whitfield. In cookeville, Tennessee, 
population 27,000, a day of sadness and shock. Days after the town 
buries well-liked state senator Tommy burks, found murdered on his 
hog farm earlier in the week, another stunning blow -- burks' political 
opponent, the local property assessor, Byron looper, is arrested and 
charged with the incumbent's murder. Looper's co-workers say there 
must be a mistake. He was a nice man. I think he is innocent and did 
not do it. What he's accused of is not the Byron looper I knew. But 
authorities say looper, a republican vying to unseat burks in the 
November 3rd election, may have had two sides. We've been very careful 
not to take charges that we didn't feel were substantial. Police got 
suspicious when they say looper turned up missing, hadn't been seen 
since hours before burks' murder on Monday. All week, townspeople 
themselves started taking notice, reflecting on what they called looper's 
unusual political behavior in recent years, indicted just this year 
for theft and misuse of office. He had unique delusions of grandeur. 
He thought highly of himself but really he was a local joke. But today, 
no one was laughing. This is the kind of case that strikes at the 
very heart of the system. Today, supporters of burks, a respected 
legislator for 28 years, campaigned for his widow, Charlotte, to fill 
his seat. And she's the proper person. Burks was a strong advocate 
of victims' rights. Two of his initiatives will still appear on the 
election ballot. Police say 34-year-old looper will be arraigned next 
week. Fredricka Whitfield, NBC news, cookeville, Tennessee.
