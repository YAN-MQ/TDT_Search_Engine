An interim peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians 
has been signed in Washington. The deal was clinched after nine days 
and nights of intense negotiations between President Clinton, the 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat. King Hussein of Jordan was also praised for his close 
involvement in the discussions. The king said the deal showed a commitment 
to the future of the Middle East. We passed the crossroad. We have 
made our commitment to the welfare and happiness and security and 
future of our peoples and all the times to come. With more details 
of the agreement, here's our Washington correspondent, Richard Lister. 
Under the interim deal, Mr. Netanyahu has agreed to redeploy troops 
from a further 13 percent of the West Bank, release some 750 jailed 
Palestinians, and open secure corridors the Palestinians travel between 
the West Bank and Gaza. The agreement, he said, was a success for 
both sides. Mr. Arafat agreed. He's pledged to arrest and imprison 
a number of Arab militants alleged to be involved in attacks on Jews 
and to annul clauses in the Palestinian charter which call for the 
destruction of Israel. Mr. Clinton will go to Gaza to witness that 
process. Richard Lister, BBC News, Washington.
