Two prominent independent editors and a publisher were summoned to 
a Serbian court Friday for criticizing President Slobodan Milosevic, 
becoming the first to be tried under a harsh media law. According 
to the new media law passed last Tuesday, each of the three faces 
fines of dinars 400,000 to 800,000 (dlrs 41,000 to dlrs 82,000) for 
allegedly ``trying to undermine the constitutional order'' of Yugoslavia 
by criticizing Milosevic and his rule. Editors Slavko Curuvija and 
Dragan Bujosevic were ordered to appear in court Friday to answer 
charges based on several articles in the current edition of the Evropljanin 
(European) weekly, which criticize Milosevic and his ``repressive'' 
policies. The publisher of Evropljanin, Ivan Tadic, was also to be 
tried at the same Belgrade district court on charges filed by a progovernment 
group called the Patriotic Union of Belgrade. The group is believed 
to be run by supporters of Milosevic's wife Mirjana Markovic. Proceedings 
started with about 100 independent journalists following the three 
to the downtown court building in a show of support. Milosevic exploited 
anti-Western sentiments about possible NATO intervention in Serbia's 
Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence, 
to pass a law banning broadcasts of Serbo-Croatian language programs 
by foreign media. The law also empowers authorities to determine which 
reports break the law and are against the constitution and further 
restricts working permits for news organizations. Independent legal 
experts and journalists say the law reimposes censorship, which Serbia 
formally abandoned in the late 1980s, and drags the country back toward 
single-party dictatorship. ``They want to strangle the independent 
media, the last remaining point of resistance, with draconian punishments, 
spreading fear among the Serbs,'' said Aleksandar Tijanic, a former 
Serbian information minister and a Evropljanin commentator. The Evropljanin 
article, entitled ``What Next, Milosevic?'' and written as a letter 
to the Yugoslav president, criticizes him for introducing ``dictatorship'' 
and leading the country into political, economic and social chaos. 
The charges filed by the Patriotic Union against the editors and the 
publisher include two pictures published in Evropljanin, one of a 
rebel of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army and a soldier 
from Romania's anti-Communist revolution, with the caption saying 
``That's the way it ended in Romania.''
