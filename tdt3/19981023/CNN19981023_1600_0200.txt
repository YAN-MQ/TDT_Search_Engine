NAto is sending its supreme commander to Yugoslavia in an attempt 
to persuade that country's government to speed up its troop withdrawal 
from the province of Kosovo. With an international deadline looming, 
there is still much work to be done. Kieran Baker has the story. As 
the NATO October 27th deadline approaches, the only real concern for 
the ethnic Albanian refugees that still roam across central kosovo 
is food and Shelter. These we spotted said they were forced to leave 
their home because of Serb police attacks. Earlier, we traveled through 
territory at the center of this conflict, from time to time stopped 
by Kosovar liberation army guerrillas who took us to areas of Serb 
destruction. This family was forced out of their home a month ago 
when one of the worst offensives began. The village was destroyed, 
and the house used as a camp by Serb police. When they returned, it 
took them six days to clear his house. Now, the rebuilding begins. 
Many other refugees still afraid to return home live in makeshift 
tents. For Roy Williams, the United States head for foreign disasters, 
he has seen it all before. The obvious concern is that the situation 
remains stable, so that we have an opportunity to do humanitarian 
work before the winter comes. Aid agencies say not much has changed, 
although access to the worst affected areas gets easier. Evidence 
of Serb military compliance is still central to this situation. But, 
according to U.S. ambassador hill, there is still not enough. We are 
not satisfied. With the level of compliance. But we're continuing 
to work on insuring that we do get full compliance. Winter is approaching 
and with it the fear of the lives of refugees without aid. In many 
ways in Kosovo, time is running out. Kieran Baker, Yugoslavia.
