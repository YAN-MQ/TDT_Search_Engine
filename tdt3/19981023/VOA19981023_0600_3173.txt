America's Country Music Association celebrated its 40th birthday in 
Nashville this week. The Country Gold Music Festival enjoyed a warm 
reception at the foot of an active volcano. And Garth Brooks has big 
plans for his next album. VOA's Doug Levine has details on those stories 
and a hot new country group to listen to. Will Garth Brooks set yet 
another sales record? His label, Capital Nashville is predicting that 
his new double CD, "Garth Brooks, Double Live," will surpass the 1 
million mark on the day it hits record stores November 17th. To help 
promote the release, Garth is planning a major publicity blitz, including 
an appearance on American television's "Tonight Show with Jay Leno" 
the night before. A special close-circuit performance to 2,400 retail 
stores the day of and three consecutive live television specials the 
day after. Maybe it should be called Garth Brooks Week.
