It is hardly surprising that people scratch their heads over a mutual 
fund like PBHG Advisor Defensive Equity. The fact that it gets 30 
percent of its returns from options summons up notions of all kinds 
of derivatives-fueled volatility. Yet the fund, with $51.2 million 
in assets, is actually a tame offering. Indeed, it has not posted 
a loss in 20 years. To underscore that safety, the fund changed its 
name from Optioned Equity two years ago. ``People fixated on the word 
`option,' '' explained Harindra de Silva, the fund's co-manager, from 
his downtown Los Angeles office. ``But we use options the way they 
were originally designed _ to hedge, not to speculate.'' Defensive 
Equity lost just 6.7 percent between the market peak on July 17 and 
Oct. 16, compared with losses of 10.1 percent for the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500-stock index and 12.3 percent for the average fund in its 
peer group of large-cap blend funds, according to Morningstar Inc., 
the financial publisher in Chicago. But hedging has been a drag on 
performance during the bull market. In the three years through Oct. 
16, the fund returned 18.1 percent, versus 24.4 percent for the S&AMP;P 
and 18.6 percent for the peer group. For such markets, de Silva and 
his co-manager, Dennis M. Bein, also run the $19.3 million PBHG Advisor 
Enhanced Equity fund, an unhedged version of its sibling. That fund 
returned 26 percent for the three years through Oct. 16, versus 24.4 
percent for the S&AMP;P and 17.1 percent for the peer group, according 
to Morningstar. (Because of its small asset size, Enhanced Equity 
is not included in the mutual fund tables of The New York Times.) 
De Silva, 38, and Bein, 31, began running Defensive Equity in 1996 
with its original manager, Charles Dobson, who retired this year. 
The pair use an investment approach derived from the work of their 
former teacher, Robert Haugen, a finance professor at the University 
of California at Irvine. ``Most money managers try to pick individual 
stocks,'' de Silva said. ``We don't believe that works, because the 
market is too efficient. But we can build a portfolio with the profile 
of a perfect stock.'' Using a personal computer, stocks are rated 
by dozens of measures, which fall into five categories. The first 
assesses value, using measures like price-to-earnings ratios. The 
second does the same for profitability, using earnings growth rates, 
among others. The third tracks risk, using factors like volatility. 
And the fourth measures liquidity, taking note of trading volume and 
other figures. The screening gets trickier in the final measurement: 
historical returns. De Silva and Bein seek out stocks whose returns 
fit a profile that they say points to superior future returns. Ideally, 
they look for a stock with a poor one-month return, which suggests 
that the shares will be relatively cheap; a strong one-year return, 
indicating good price momentum, and a poor five-year return. ``That 
adds a contrarian flavor,'' Bein said. Key to the discipline is that 
they need not find ``perfect'' stocks that fit each ideal parameter. 
Instead, they require only that their total portfolio's blended average 
does so. How do they put it all together? By using what they call 
an optimization process that crunches the data they collect to build 
a portfolio of 70 to 100 names from the S&AMP;P 500 that together 
have such ideal characteristics. Consider a sampling of different 
measurements from three of its top stocks as of Oct. 16. On that date, 
American International Group had a P/E of 23.3 and per-share earnings 
growth of 14.1 percent. The stock lagged the S&AMP;P 500 by 1.1 percentage 
points over the last five years and by 3.7 percentage points for the 
12-month period _ the latter return indicating bad price momentum. 
Ameritech had a P/E of 15.38 and per-share earnings growth of 29.2 
percent. It's stock beat the S&AMP;P 500 by 24 percentage points during 
the last 12 months and 3.3 percentage points during the last five 
years _ the high five-year return indicating bad contrarian potential. 
Throw in McDonald's, with a P/E of 27.03 and per-share earnings growth 
of 7.6 percent _ a sign of poor growth prospects. It lagged the S&AMP;P 
500 by 6.7 percentage points over the past five years, but beat it 
by 7.2 percentage points over 12 months. The weighted average of these 
three stocks stacks up quite attractively against the S&AMP;P 500. 
The three stock portfolio has a P/E of 22.4 percent versus the S&AMP;P 
500's 32.64 percent, indicating better valuation. Per-share earnings 
growth is 16 percent, better than the index's 11.4 percent. The portfolio 
lagged the S&AMP;P 500 by 2 percentage points over the past five years, 
giving it a strong potential for rebounding, but beat it by 9 percentage 
points over the last 12 months, indicating strong price momentum, 
Bein said. How do de Silva and Bein take advantage of options? The 
two managers write, or sell, call options, which give purchasers the 
right to buy stock at an agreed-upon price, called the strike price, 
within a certain time, from less than a day to several years. The 
managers make money if the stock price stays flat or moves no higher 
than the strike price _ a simple defensive play. Think of the option 
income as steady dividend payments, Bein said. ``It's like a high 
dividend-paying stock fund, without the vulnerability of owning a 
big chunk of utilities stocks,'' he added. The fund's front-end load, 
or sales charge, of 5.75 percent will be waived indefinitely starting 
Monday.
