A new type of living will offers people in 33 states the chance to 
make life or death decisions before they're actually faced with them. 
The five wishes document was first used in Florida a year ago. It 
offers easy to understand instructions, and was so popular its authors 
picked up a grant to conform it to state laws around the nation. It's 
easy to use and understand and it should be because this is a right 
that people have to say what kind of care they want when they are 
seriously ill and whether they want a lot of aggressive treatment 
withdrawn or withheld. It should be in people's language. It shouldn't 
be in doctor's speak or lawyer's speak. It should be in words that 
people understand. That's why it has had such enormous appeal in Florida. 
An estimated one in five Americans has written a living will.
