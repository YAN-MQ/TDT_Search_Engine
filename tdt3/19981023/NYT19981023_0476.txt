Less than a month ago, Gov. Pete Wilson let loose national political 
lightning by signing a bill moving California's presidential primary 
to the front of the pack in 2000, on March 7, just after New Hampshire 
and Iowa. But unless voters here pass an obscure ballot measure next 
month, the new primary may be virtually meaningless. That is because 
both major national political parties require that delegates to their 
nominating conventions be chosen by party members only, but two years 
ago, voters in California created a blanket primary system, in which 
all candidates' names appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, 
and Democratic and Republican voters can mix and match. So this year, 
Wilson and the Legislature agreed to put a measure on the Nov. 3 ballot, 
returning the state's presidential primary to the old system, in which 
voters from each party get separate ballots. But the measure has drawn 
little public notice and no financial backing amid a raft of tight 
races. If the measure, known as Proposition 3, fails, the California 
parties could be forced to create some kind of elaborate and costly 
parallel system _ caucuses, conventions, or mail-in balloting _ to 
choose their delegates, while the primary would be just for show. 
That has political professionals here gnashing their teeth in rare 
agreement. ``It's one of the few things where Republicans and Democrats 
agree,'' said Leslie Goodman, a Republican political consultant in 
Sacramento. ``But for all the hoopla about the new primary, we're 
going to be relegated to a beauty contest if this doesn't pass.'' 
The point of moving up the primary was to increase California's influence, 
after years in which the state's June primary came too late to make 
it a player. But the effort will be moot if Proposition 3 fails. It 
is too late for the national parties to change their rules, even if 
they wanted to _ and they do not. The parties' only other hope is 
a challenge to the open primary law now pending in the 9th Circuit 
U.S. Court of Appeals. A federal judge earlier ruled that the open 
primary served an important purpose in giving voters greater choice, 
and fell within strict limits set by the Supreme Court. A recent statewide 
Field Poll found that 83 percent of likely voters were not even aware 
of Proposition 3, and that even after the ballot description was read 
to them, only 26 percent said they would vote ``yes'' on it. The telephone 
poll of 703 likely voters had a margin of error of five and a half 
percentage points. Election experts were aware of the potential problem 
when the measure was passed in 1996, but it drew little public notice 
then. ``The idea of `open' sounded nice to people,'' said state Republican 
chairman Michael Schroeder. ``They didn't realize what the effect 
would be.'' If Proposition 3 fails, Schroeder said the parties here, 
like those in the other two states with blanket primaries, Alaska 
and Washington, would have no choice but to adopt some new system, 
like caucuses, conventions or mail-in ballots to select delegates. 
But he said that such options were undesirable and that a mail-in 
election could cost $500,000, which would have to be financed by the 
party, unlike a normal election, which is financed by the state. A 
spokesman for the state Democratic Party, Bob Mulholland, agreed that 
none of the options seemed practical. ``It's something that we don't 
like,'' Mulholland said, ``but we'll just have to deal with it.'' 
Schroeder said that national Republican Party rules allowed states 
with blanket primaries to select their delegates at any time. The 
California Republicans have already set their 2000 state convention 
for the second week of February, and Schroeder said, ``Whatever we 
end up doing, we'll probably do it then.'' Conventions or caucuses 
tend to draw the most die-hard party members, which means liberals 
for the Democrats and conservatives for Republicans. That prospect 
is unappealing to a moderate like Wilson, a Republican who hoped the 
moved-up primary could be a key to a possible Presidential candidacy 
of his own. ``It would be a pretty strange thing for the parties to 
try to set up a caucus and ignore the results of a primary,'' said 
Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh.
