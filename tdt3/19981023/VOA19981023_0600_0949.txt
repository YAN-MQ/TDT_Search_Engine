Authorities in the U.S. state of Colorado are investigating the validity 
of a message signed by a militant environmental group saying its set 
a series of fires at the Vail Ski Resort. The group, called Earth 
Liberation Front, said it set the fires to protest an expansion of 
the ski resort. The message also said the fires were carried out on 
behalf of the animal the lynx. The fires early Monday destroyed three 
buildings and heavily damaged four ski lifts. Damage is estimated 
at $12 million. Investigators have said the fires are suspicious but 
they have not yet determined whether it was arson.
