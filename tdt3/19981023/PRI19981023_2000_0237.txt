A candidate for the state legislature in Tennessee has been arrested 
on charges of murdering his opponent, a state senator who championed 
the rights of crime victims. Thirty-four-year-old Byron Looper was 
taken into custody today. He had changed his middle name to "Low Tax" 
so he would be identified that way on the ballot. His attorney says 
the case has all the elements of a made-for-TV movie.
