When we come back this evening, can the president expect a political 
bounce from nine days of diplomacy? We'll take a look at the Saturday 
morning "New York Times." Turning on the light, I was immediately 
aware of something different. It was the same room, she was the same 
woman, yet somehow, incredibly, something had changed. The enrich 
bulb from GE. Its innovative glass filters out Rays that dull colors. 
Blues look bluer, reds redder, almost everything looks better. Her 
blue eyes blazed, her black hair burned. She turned to me, I turned 
to her, and said... that's some lightbulb. The incredible enrich bulb. 
Only from GE.
