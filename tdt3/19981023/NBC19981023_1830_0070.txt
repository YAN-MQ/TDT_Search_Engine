Good evening. It's never easy getting any kind of agreement in the 
Middle East, but the dealmaking that's been going on for the last 
24 hours was in a class of its own. All-night sessions, with president 
present until daybreak, a breakdown over a spy, more hard bargaining 
all day. And tonight, a deal, of sorts. We begin with NBC's Claire 
Shipman at the White House. Tom, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders 
have signed the agreement that now puts them in the final phase of 
the peace process, and it was a rocky road. The much delayed ceremony 
was squeezed in today just before the start of the Jew wish sabbath 
at sundown. The participants were we'rery but the peace was papable. 
This is an important point to give a better future to our children, 
and the children of our neighbors, the Palestinians. Bill Clinton 
who spent more than 80 hours at negotiations at the whoi plantation 
clearly savored the personal try um pt. People should be honored by 
this achievement. Israel will withdraw from 13% of the Wes bank in 
exchange for extensionive security guarantees from the Palestinians. 
Adding moral weight and considerable pressure to the process was Jordan's 
king Hussein, who was in the United States undergoing chemotherapy 
for lymphoma. We have had enough destruction, enough death, Now, if 
this was a test of an embattled president's clout, aides are ecstatic 
at his success. They said that he seemed to understand not only his 
role as peacemaker but as Korea yater of his legacy.
