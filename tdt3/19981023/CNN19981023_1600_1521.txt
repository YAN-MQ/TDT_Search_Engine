Picture it -- a romantic evening, candlelight, and the soothing sounds 
of joe Pesci? Brown eyes. The academy award-winning actor has a new 
CD out, filled with songs and wisecracks. Mark Scheerer reports. My 
cousin Vinny yo, cousin Vinny It's Vincent laguardia gambini. You 
know him as cousin Vinny from the 1992 film "my cousin Vinny." He's 
at the record store to sign copies of his new CD. In reality, of course, 
he's Joe Pesci. And, in reality, this Oscar-winning goodfellow did 
record a CD. Can you believe that? I don't drive by because I'm a 
wise guy I just stop by with a couple of guys We thought it would 
be fun to hear a neighborhood guy sing all different kinds of songs, 
you know, and give them a chance, because everybody likes to sing. 
I said, let's make "my cousin Vinny" sing. How long have you been 
practicing? Almost six weeks. Actually, he's been at it a lot longer. 
In fact, he was a member of the touring version of the '60s band, 
Joey D. and the starlighters. Even still, wouldn't he be better off 
staying "home alone"? But I got it all figured out. Watch this. Supermodels 
want to be charmed one chick's brunette the other one's blonde i heard 
their fathers had stocks and bonds so I them up and left them floatin' 
in a pond There's language on the album that's barely fit for a racketeers' 
ears. I don't know. It's so terrible, this language. It's just for 
fun. You know, there's a clean version, too, as you know. But the 
parental advisory one is probably a little more fun. You know, it's 
just for fun. You worry too much. Everything is beautiful. There's 
nothing to worry about. Hey, who knows? Maybe Joe Pesci the singer 
will have his five minutes of fame. Are you sure about that five minutes? 
Yeah, yeah. Are you sure about that five minutes? I don't know. I 
think you made your point. Are you sure about that five minutes? I'm 
really afraid you're going to shoot me in the foot or something. No, 
I might smack you in the head with a bat. Any tour plans? I'm going 
on tour? no. I have a career, remember? I think I still have one. 
I don't know, maybe I killed it with this. Custom made clothes from 
head to toe catch Joe at the fight sitting in the first row everybody 
follows when I'm ready to go no need to show off they already know 
I'm a wise guy I'm a wise guy Could be a hit, this album. I mean, 
he has been a hitman. Knock on wood. Mark Scheerer, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
