In a ruling that will limit the way police departments conduct some 
sting operations involving marijuana, the State Court of Appeals in 
Albany, N.Y., Thursday reversed a Monroe County Court decision that 
allowed people who believed they were buying marijuana to be charged 
with criminal solicitation. The case involved 54 defendants who bought 
small amounts of what they believed to be marijuana, but which was 
actually oregano, from police officers in Rochester, N.Y., who were 
acting as drug sellers. Because undercover officers are not allowed 
to sell real marijuana, the buyers could not be charged with possession 
of marijuana, a violation that carries a maximum fine of $100. Instead, 
they were charged with criminal solicitation, which carries a maximum 
sentence of 15 days in jail. The Court of Appeals ruled that they 
could not be charged with criminal solicitation because of an exemption 
in the penal code that states ``a person is not guilty of criminal 
solicitation when his solicitation constitutes conduct of a kind that 
is necessarily incidental to the commission of the crime solicited.'' 
David Steinberg, chief assistant public defender in Dutchess County, 
said, ``Basically it's a legal exemption, a defense to a charge of 
criminal solicitation, when the conduct complained of is part and 
parcel to the commission of the crime that is being solicited.'' Steinberg 
is now appealing a criminal solicitation conviction in a reverse sting 
case in which his client tried to buy crack cocaine from an undercover 
officer in July 1997. Thursday's ruling spells an end to reverse sting 
operations involving marijuana, according to Thomas Rainbow Morse, 
an assistant district attorney who represented the state, but not 
to all reverse sting drug operations. Other drugs carry higher penalties 
than marijuana. Although cocaine buyers may no longer be charged with 
criminal solicitation, they can be charged with attempted possession 
of cocaine. ``Attempted possession of marijuana is not an offense,'' 
said Edward Nowak, the Monroe County public defender, who represented 
the 54 defendants. Morse said he was not giving up and that he hoped 
to change the criminal solicitation statute. ``We're going to move 
the halls of justice to the corridors of the Legislature,'' he said. 
``We hope to find a sponsor in the next session of the Legislature.''
