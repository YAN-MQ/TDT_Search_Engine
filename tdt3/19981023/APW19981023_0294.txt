Germany will fly water purification and medical equipment this weekend 
to Sudan to help people suffering from war, flood and famine. The 
German Red Cross said they hoped to provide drinkable water for 50,000 
people in southern Sudan. Experts from Germany, Sweden, Finland and 
Austria would work in the region for at least three months. Two-thirds 
of the program's 1.2 million marks (dlrs 750,000) cost was covered 
by the federal government, the rest from donations.
