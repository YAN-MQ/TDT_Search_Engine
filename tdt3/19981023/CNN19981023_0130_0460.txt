Fire officials in California are telling homeowners, no property is 
worth losing a life over. They say people should heed evacuation orders 
if there's a wildfire nearby. Firefighters are gaining the upperhand 
against three large fires that have burned 15,000 acres in southern 
California. That task could be made more difficult by the Santa Ana 
winds. They're in the forecast for the weekend.
