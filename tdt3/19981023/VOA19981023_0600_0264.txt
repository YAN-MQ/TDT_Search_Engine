Typhoon Babs has killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands 
of homes in its destructive sweep across the Philippines' Northern 
Irelands -- or islands. Officials say the death toll may rise as more 
isolated provinces are heard from. Businesses and government buildings 
in Manila closed Friday, as high winds and rain lashed the area. At 
midday Friday, the eye of the storm had passed over Lusann Island 
and Babs was headed into the South China Sea.
