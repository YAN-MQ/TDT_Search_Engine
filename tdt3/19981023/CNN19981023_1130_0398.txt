American intelligence officials may have had a warning about the bombing 
of the U.S. embassy in Kenya. "The New York Times" says an Egyptian 
now held in the bombing of the american embassy in Tanzania gave intelligence 
officials at the Nairobi embassy information about the plot nine months 
before the explosions. The embassy apparently increased security for 
a few weeks, but returned to normal when there was no attack. The 
state department says it was not warned. The blasts killed 224 people, 
including 12 Americans and injured more than 5,000 others.
