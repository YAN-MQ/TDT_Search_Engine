Meanwhile, a deal that could create the largest international airline 
has once again hit a snag. There are reports today that U.S. regulators 
have suspended their scrutiny of the British Airways/American Airlines 
alliance. The two carriers have been fighting for regulatory approval 
for more than two years in both America and Britain. Part of the difficulty 
is the fact that the deal has become enmeshed in negotiations for 
an Anglo U.S. open skies agreement, which would allow airlines from 
both countries more access to each other's markets. Well, that's all 
the business news this Friday. For THE WORLD, I'm Liz George in New 
York.
