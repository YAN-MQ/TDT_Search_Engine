For nearly four years, many Haitians in New York have been united 
in their resolve to have the United States extradite Emmanuel Constant, 
the former leader of a right-wing paramilitary group, so that he can 
face charges in Haiti that he killed and tortured thousands of people 
there. But as Constant continues to live on a quiet street in Laurelton, 
Queens, serious divisions have emerged over the wisdom of sending 
back a man who symbolizes to many Haitians the brutality of the time 
when the military ran the country. Some Haitians in New York are now 
suggesting that Haiti is racked by too many problems, and question 
whether its fragile legal system could prosecute such a high-profile 
case. The debate has been fueled by the emergence of a surprising 
opponent to his deportation: Arlette Belance, a street food vendor 
whose arm was cut off and who was left for dead on a roadside in Haiti 
after a bloody coup ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. 
Four years later, about 20,000 foreign troops invaded Haiti and restored 
Aristide to power. Ms. Belance, 38, who now lives in New Jersey, noted 
that she still had family in Haiti, and said that Constant was a bigger 
threat there than here, although she said she still believed that 
he should be arrested. ``Sending him back is not a solution,'' Ms. 
Belance said. ``It's only symbolic and we can't assure that he will 
face justice.'' The debate is raging among Haitians even as the City 
Council voted unanimously Thursday to put pressure on the U.S. government 
to extradite or deport Constant to stand trial in his homeland. During 
the City Council's hearings, Ms. Belance did not testify, underscoring 
the rift that the Constant case has created among the 500,000 Haitians 
in the New York City region. Ms. Belance's arguments echo those made 
by State Department and Immigration officials in refusing to return 
Constant to Haiti despite the Haitian government's extradition request 
three years ago. After she was found near death in Haiti, photographs 
of Ms. Belance appeared on front pages of newspapers around the world, 
calling attention to the brutality of the paramilitary groups. But 
in June, she said she had become disenchanted with the Center for 
Constitutional Rights _ which aggressively lobbied the City Council 
to pass Thursday's resolution _ because the group had used her picture 
for fund-raising without her permission. ``It seems that they have 
their own political agenda that does not have anything to do with 
the realities of Haiti,'' Ms. Belance said in Creole during a telephone 
interview in Canada. ``I don't want them using my pictures in their 
brochures. I don't support their cause.'' Michael Ratner, a lawyer 
for the Center for Constitutional Rights, said that the principal 
question was whether Constant should remain free. ``At this point, 
Haitian government officials think they can handle this case,'' Ratner 
said. ``Why should I second-guess them?'' Constant, 42, the son of 
a military officer, spent part of his career as a diplomat, assigned 
to Haiti's U.N. mission. But in 1993, he emerged as the leader of 
a shadowy group, the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, 
that is believed responsible for the torture and killings of thousands 
of people. A few months after United States troops raided his headquarters 
in Port-au-Prince, the capital, Constant was allowed to enter the 
United States on a tourist visa. He was arrested by immigration officials 
in 1995 but appealed for political asylum and was released a year 
later. Ricot Dupuy, manager of Radio Soleil d'Haiti in Flatbush, Brooklyn, 
said he supported sending Constant back. ``The whole idea of Toto 
Constant living free in New York, the bastion of the Haitian diaspora, 
is definitely one of the biggest insults to Haitians here,'' Dupuy 
said. ``I don't know any other ethnic groups in New York that would 
have been dealt this insult.''
