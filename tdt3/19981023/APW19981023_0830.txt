PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The American head of the Kosovo ground 
verification mission, William Walker, arrived in the province Friday, 
vowing to improve conditions for refugees and help guarantee success 
of the Oct. 12 peace agreement. Up to 2,000 personnel are expected 
to join the mission, run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, to provide the ``eyes and ears'' of the international community 
and make sure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic honors the accord. 
``I wanted to come in here as early as possible to demonstrate the 
seriousness with which OSCE takes this mission,'' Walker said. ``I 
cannot tell you how impressed I am by the reaction of the international 
community to put together this mission very quickly and very robustly.'' 
Walker said OSCE officials ``think we can make conditions get better 
and we are going to do everything we possibly can to help Kosovo return 
to being a stable, peaceful community living under a process of true 
democracy.'' He said the verifiers would help establish what is actually 
happening on the ground in the province. He also safety was a major 
concern. ``It would be foolish of us ... to ask unarmed international 
verifiers to walk into combat,'' he said. ``When two sides are firing 
at each other, I'm not going to send my people into the middle of 
it, because those are usually the people who get hurt. But I don't 
think this is going to undermine our ability to know what's going 
on.'' He also said he had received assurances of support from the 
ethnic Albanian community. ``I have been very encouraged by the talks 
I have had here in Kosovo ... with representatives of the Albanian 
community,'' he said. ``The last thing on their minds is bringing 
into harms' way the international verifiers. I think everyone understands 
we are coming in her unarmed with no preconceived opinions as to what's 
been going on here. We are here to look and see what the reality of 
the situation is.''
