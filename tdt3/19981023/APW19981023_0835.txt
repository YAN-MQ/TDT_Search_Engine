A suspected Turkish underworld boss who had escaped from prison was 
convicted Friday on charges of entering the country illegally and 
possessing an unlicensed gun, the state news agency BTA reported. 
Yacup ``Kursat'' Yilmaz and Ali Oymak got a one-year term each for 
illegal entry into Bulgaria and another 10 months for possession of 
false documents, the report said. Oymak will serve an extra year and 
three months for illegal possession of a pistol. The two other defendants, 
Suleyman Kavrak and Behcet Hasanov, a Bulgarian ethnic Turk, were 
sentenced to three months on probation. The court confiscated 50,000 
US dollars, 50,000 Deutsche marks, a Makarov pistol with a cartridge 
and 20 bullets. The convicts will cover the expenses for the trial. 
The sentence was passed by a panel of the district court in the Black 
Sea town of Varna, where police arrested the gang last July. Yilmaz 
and Oymac escaped from a Turkish prison last February. Yilmaz has 
been serving a sentence for ordering his men to kill a mayor and a 
businessman in southwestern Turkey. He had previously also been convicted 
of extortion. A separate trial on extraditing Yilmaz and Oymac to 
Turkey is scheduled next month.
