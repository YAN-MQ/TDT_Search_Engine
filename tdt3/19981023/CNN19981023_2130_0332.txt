An estimated 3 1/2 million New Yorkers crammed the streets of the 
financial district today. They came to cheer their beloved Yankees 
who paraded past under a stream of paper. The world series champions 
won more games this year than any baseball team in history. You know 
they are going to question on where this ball club belongs in the 
history of baseball. I can only say one thing in my opinion 125 and 
50 -- these guys are the best guys that have ever played the game. 
Thank you. The parade today was all the more memorable for Yankee 
pitcher Orlando hernandez because his mother and two daughters were 
able to attend. They live in Cuba and received special permission 
from the Cuban government to travel to New York for the festivities. 
Hernandez fled Cuba by boat last December.
