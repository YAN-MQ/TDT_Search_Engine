New Yorkers may be thrilled with their Yankees' world series win, 
but not everyone is celebrating at the fox network. Susan Lisovicz 
has the story. The New York Yankees are so good that they not only 
annihilated the San Diego padres, they also killed TV ratings at fox. 
Experts say the fox network needed a five-game series to break even 
and a Sixth to turn a profit. Instead, Nielsen research says the four-game 
Rout by the winningest baseball team ever will go down as the lowest-rated 
world series in history. The fact that the world series is down is 
very simple. It was a four-game sweep. A four-game sweep is not competitive. 
Therefore, it doesn't attract the casual viewer. The casual viewer 
likes to see the tenseness of the competitive -- did they win the 
first game, the second game, back to going back and forth? Whenever 
you have a seven-game series, a six-game series you're gonna have 
a bigger rating. Whenever you have a sweep, you're gonna have a smaller 
rating. But fox, NBC and ESPN did not strike out during regular season 
play. The entire nation was transfixed by the home run race between 
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, which translated into ratings that nearly 
equaled levels last seen before the 1994 players' strike. It was also 
a season that saw Cal Ripken Jr. retire his record of most consecutive 
games played as well as a Yankee team that has been called one of 
the greatest clubs to ever take the field. All of this resonates with 
advertisers who may be asked to pay higher rates next season. Baseball 
as an event throughout the entire season, including the world series, 
has got a much more positive glow to it now than it had over the past 
five years. But not all advertisers are going to bite. Another media 
Buyer told CNN that he buys only on the numbers. And as full of heart 
as this season was, the world series ratings simply weren't good enough 
to command higher rates. Susan Lisovicz, "CNN Financial News," New 
York.
