Typhoon Babs has killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands 
of homes in its destructive sweep across the Philippines Northern 
islands. At least 53 people were killed in landslides on the island 
Canadwines, where the typhoon made first landfall Thursday. About 
17 died in landslides in nearby Camarines, -- province. Officials 
say the death toll may rise as more isolated provinces are heard from. 
Roads throughout the central and northern Philippine Islands were 
closed, washed out, or covered by landslides. Businesses and government 
buildings in Manila closed Friday, as high winds and rain lashed the 
area. At midnight Friday, the eye of the storm had passed over Lusann 
Island and Babs was headed into the South China Sea.
