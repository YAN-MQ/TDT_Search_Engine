And the Telephone Organization of Thailand has revoked a deal worth 
more than $200 million -- $280 million and it was awarded to six companies. 
The deal was revoked for what the Thai firm says are budgetary and 
technical constraints. Under the deal, a high-speed digital telecommunications 
system was to have been installed. Among those that signed up for 
the deal were Siemens Company of Germany and Ericcson of Sweden. Two 
Thai telecom firms were also involved.
