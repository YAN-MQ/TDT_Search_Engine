Just ahead, international media coverage on the browser wars and the 
case against Microsoft. That's on PRI, Public Radio International. 
JOE PRESUDO PAMACO, PRI CORRESPONDENT This is public radio, 91 FM, 
WHYY. Good evening, I'm Joe Presudo Pamaco saying a big thank you 
to you if you made a pledge during the membership drive. We just finished 
up just a few minutes ago. We're packing up the phones now, but you 
can still make a pledge online at whyy.org. Thanks again. Tune in 
tomorrow for "Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me." That's the NPR News quiz 
with Peter Sagel and Carl Castle. This week, the "Wait, Wait, Don't 
Tell Me" team of researchers are trying to find something not included 
in the budget package passed this week. And NPR's Brook Gladstone 
speaks softly and carries a big stick. So that and much more on "Wait, 
Wait, Don't Tell Me," which laughs at the news. And that's at p.m. 
Saturday with a rebroadcast Saturday night at 11:00 here on 91 fm.
