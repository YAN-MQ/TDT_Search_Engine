We were still using telephone party lines in the late 1960s when a 
mentally retarded woman in my small Midwestern town dialed information 
and asked for my mother's number. ``I want to call Karen,'' said the 
woman, who can here be identified only as Wanda. ``Karen who?'' the 
operator inquired. ``What's her last name?'' ``I don't know,'' Wanda 
replied. ``Just Karen.'' The operator asked questions like a razor-sharp 
detective's, pieced together her clues and somehow delivered the correct 
number. In the gee-whiz technology of the 1990s, the party line is 
long gone. So too, it seems, is Wanda's operator. As most anyone who 
uses directory assistance knows, the operator often does not have 
the number these days, especially for long-distance calls. This is 
largely because there is no single clearinghouse of America's telephone 
listings, and there is precious little sharing of numbers among the 
companies that have their own lists or data bases. For people who 
depend on directory assistance, the paucity of information can mean 
a tortuous journey through the telephone twilight zone _ and typically 
at about $1 a long-distance inquiry. In this dimension, things that 
seemed certain to exist upon last sighting _ a school, a police station, 
a church _ a grandmother, for goodness' sake _ suddenly leave no telephonic 
trace. ``Minneapolis Public Library, please,'' was my request to directory 
assistance one day. ``Sorry,'' chirped the operator. ``No listing 
for a public library in Minneapolis.'' ``Please check again _ maybe 
it's listed as a municipal library.'' ``No library in Minneapolis.'' 
``Look, Minneapolis is a big city. It's got to have a library. Don't 
you think?'' ``Not one that's listed, sir. Sorry.'' Click. Another 
time I requested the number of a local church. ``No listing,'' said 
the operator. ``Maybe it's new.'' ``It was new,'' I couldn't resist 
replying, ``in 1897.'' In the beginning, there was Ma Bell. She knew 
just about everybody's number. But since Congress broke up the telephone 
monopoly in the 1980s, phone companies have been left with their own 
directory lists, which they guard jealously. The Telecommunications 
Act of 1996 requires the owners to release these lists at a ``reasonable'' 
cost, but AT&AMP;T, for example, says it refuses to pay the prices 
most local phone companies ask and is trying to negotiate lower fees. 
In the meantime, it is using lists compiled from other sources, like 
the white pages, which can be out of date. Moreover, with some services 
centralized, a question about a phone number in Milwaukee may go to 
an operator sitting in Florida. ``We know the problem exists,'' said 
Howard McNally, a vice president of AT&AMP;T who is in charge of directory 
assistance. He says the accuracy rate is nearly 95 percent, adding, 
``Things will get better.'' AT&AMP;T now has a new service called 
``Double 0 Info'' guaranteeing that consumers will talk to a real 
live person _ and for as long as it takes to get an answer. Callers 
can also develop their own strategies for coping in the world of directory 
assistance. They can demand to speak to a supervisor, who is more 
likely to go the extra mile to find a missing number. Another trick 
is simply to hang up and call directory assistance again, in the hope 
that the next operator will be more savvy. (The cost of the extra 
call can often be recovered by reporting unsatisfactory service to 
the phone company.) But for many Americans, getting a simple telephone 
number can still be an adventure. In some cases, the long-distance 
operator will come up empty, put the caller on hold, dial the local 
exchange to get the number and then give it to the caller. And that's 
if you're lucky. I have a running feud with directory-assistance operators 
about the area code in which I live, an issue that comes up when I 
am out of town. The computer apparently insists that my town, Sycamore, 
Ill., has two area codes: 815 (the correct one) and 708. Anybody familiar 
with the geography of northern Illinois knows that the 708 area hugs 
Chicago. My town, on the other hand, is deep in cornfield country, 
65 miles and two area codes away. But to an operator sitting in Florida, 
I might as well be talking about Mars. Mark Cooper, a spokesman for 
the Consumer Federation of America, sizes up post-Ma Bell progress. 
``Before the breakup, information was an unbilled service in which 
you got a person,'' Cooper said. ``Now you pay for it, and you often 
get a computer.''
