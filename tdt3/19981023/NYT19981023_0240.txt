Murderer. Thief. Cannibal? Oh, the writer at work! Perhaps the way 
authors work was most famously described in two books by Janet Malcolm: 
``The Journalist and the Murderer,'' in which she compares journalists 
to confidence men who betray their subjects without remorse, and ``The 
Silent Woman,'' in which she described biographers as ``professional 
burglars.'' You can see the writer at work, too, in Philip Roth's 
new novel, ``I Married a Communist,'' in which the main character's 
life is ruined when his ex-wife writes a tell-all book about him revealing 
that he is a communist. In real life, two years ago, Roth's ex-wife 
Claire Bloom published a memoir accusing Roth of being a self-absorbed 
misogynist who forced her to make her own daughter move out of the 
house. To some readers of Roth, who has made a career of taking elements 
from his life for his fiction, his new novel about a neurotic, vengeful 
ex-wife, Eve Frame, is simply payback, an act of revenge for Ms. Bloom's 
invasion of his privacy. Of course, great novelists from Flaubert 
to Joyce to Dreiser have used real people as the basis for their fictional 
characters at one time or another. And even when the central premise 
of a novel is pure fiction, elements of it are almost always drawn 
from authors' own experience _ the lineaments of a face, for instance, 
scraps of dialogue or newspaper reports. In his book ``Couples,'' 
John Updike wrote a description of his first wife's feet, and the 
particular way her toes curled. ``Writers have never made things up,'' 
novelist David Leavitt said last week. ``All you have to do is read 
Proust to understand that.'' He was speaking at an Authors Guild symposium, 
``Whose Life Is It, Anyway?,'' at the New York Society for Ethical 
Culture, and he should know. Five years ago, Leavitt got into hot 
water when he borrowed elements from the late poet Sir Stephen Spender's 
life for his novel with a homosexual theme, ``While England Sleeps.'' 
After Spender threatened to sue because of copyright infringement, 
calling Leavitt's work ``pornographic,'' all copies of the novel had 
to be ground to pulp and Leavitt was forced to make revisions. Still, 
often the ``truth'' in a work of fiction is a collection of the tiniest 
fragments of reality. ``There is a significant gap between the autobiographical 
writer that I am thought to be and the autobiographical writer that 
I am,'' Roth writes in ``The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography.'' 
Some have argued that all writing is an act of betrayal or aggression. 
Indeed, writing often involves an invasion, a theft, an exposure of 
something private, and the issue of a writer's right to use the lives 
of real people in his work has always been debated. Henry James, who 
some scholars say led a hidden life as a homosexual, wrote on the 
publication of George Sand's letters to Alfred de Musset that ``the 
eternal dispute between the public and the private, between curiosity 
and delicacy,'' is ``the greatest of all literary quarrels.'' James 
made the issue the core of his novella ``The Aspern Papers,'' in which 
a nameless narrator tries to get his hands on a famous poet's love 
letters. Recently, with a proliferation of tell-all books _ Kathryn 
Harrison's memoir about having sex with her father, Mia Farrow's memoir 
about her life with Woody Allen, Lillian Ross' memoir of her affair 
with the New Yorker editor William Shawn _ the issue of art vs. privacy 
has taken on a new urgency. In ``Collected Stories'' a play by Donald 
Margulies that is currently running Off Broadway, a famous writer 
takes on a young protegee. In talking about the art of writing with 
the young woman, she admits that all writers are ``scavengers.'' She 
also confides in the course of the play that she had an affair with 
the poet Delmore Schwartz, only to be betrayed herself when the young 
woman uses her mentor's private life in her own work. Margulies has 
said the play was inspired by Stephen Spender's suit against Leavitt. 
``The deepest satisfaction of good fiction comes from the encounter 
between the reader's imagination and the writer's creation,'' Janna 
Malamud Smith, the daughter of novelist Bernard Malamud, once wrote. 
``It is a fluid, delicate and personal relationship that occurs in 
an evanescent space.'' To some extent, the recent debate about the 
morality of authors' using real lives in their work is a result of 
the expansion of the media and its relentless appetite for true stories. 
Ms. Smith argues that this trend is, at its core, a hunger for a connection 
with other people that springs from a particularly modern lack of 
intimacy. This hunger, she writes in her book ``Private Matters: In 
Defense of the Personal Life,'' is a byproduct of a shift in society 
from the rural and traditional, the ``communal,'' to the urban, modern 
and separate. Writers feed that hunger by feeding on private lives. 
``We are cannibals,'' Cynthia Ozick admitted at the symposium. ``I 
think it's a terrible thing to be a friend of, an acquaintance of, 
a relative of, a writer.'' Indeed, one has to wonder how English novelist 
Iris Murdoch would feel, were she not suffering from Alzheimer's disease, 
about the new memoir by her husband, John Bayley, ``Elegy for Iris.'' 
It is a loving work but also brutally honest, describing, for instance, 
her dirty hair. At the Authors Guild symposium, Ms. Smith remembered 
her dismay when she read ``Dubin's' Lives,'' her father's novel about 
a biographer, and found the biographer's daughter had taken over ``my 
habit of memorizing poems.'' After her father died, and biographers 
began seeking information about his private life, Ms. Smith turned 
them away. ``One of the reasons novelists' relatives can become testy 
about public revelation is because they have already borne exposure,'' 
she said. Still, Ms. Smith admitted that her resistance might also 
``come from my own competitive wishes to write, perhaps even about 
him,'' she said. Her father's good friend, Roth, has already written 
one novel, ``The Ghost Writer,'' about her father, using Malamud as 
the basis for the character of the hermetic novelist Lonoff. Not everyone 
shares Ms. Smith's concern for privacy, however. The singer Judy Collins, 
whose most recent book is ``Singing Lessons,'' a memoir about the 
aftermath of her son's suicide, sees writing as a kind of therapy. 
Although writers may feel there are few moral limits to what they 
can borrow from real lives, there are legal limits. Leon Friedman, 
who was Spender's American lawyer in his dispute with Leavitt and 
who moderated the Authors Guild panel, observed that ``under New York 
state law, you cannot use a person's name, portrait or picture for 
purposes of trade without their permission.'' You can, however, use 
a person's identity if you don't use his name, he added. That is, 
unless you libel them. ``Still, for a fictional portrait to be actionable, 
it must be so accurate that a reader of the book would have no problem 
linking the two,'' said Friedman. Thus, he continued, libel lawyers 
have what is known as ``the small penis rule.'' One way authors can 
protect themselves from libel suits is to say that a character has 
a small penis, Friedman said. ``Now no male is going to come forward 
and say, `That character with a very small penis, `That's me!''' Copyright 
infringement is another obstacle, Friedman noted, as in the case of 
Ian Hamilton, who tried to write a biography of J.D. Salinger. Salinger 
refused to let him use his letters, and because they were copyrighted 
he couldn't. Author Calvin Trillin, who has frequently used his real-life 
family as the subject of his books, well knows the dangers of appropriating 
the real thing. As he explained in a recent interview about his new 
book ``Family Man,'' when his daughters were about 5 and 8 he asked 
them to sign a standard nondisclosure agreement: ``Nothing fancy. 
When they didn't understand why they were doing it, I said, `Trust 
your daddy.' '' Of course, some use of real-life material can be accidental. 
Cynthia Ozick told of publishing a short story in The New Yorker about 
a school. ``Part of my story involved my fictional headmaster sleeping 
with his girlfriend,'' said Ms. Ozick. But she was stunned to receive 
a call from the assistant headmaster of her own daughter's school 
in which ``he questioned my morality,'' she said, accusing her of 
basing her character on the real headmaster. And then the headmaster 
himself threatened to sue her. The New Yorker temporarily canceled 
its contract with her, Ms. Ozick said, and her publisher, Alfred Knopf, 
delayed publication of a collection of stories that included the one 
in dispute. But then real life had an uncanny echo of fiction when, 
said Ms. Ozick, ``the morality-preaching assistant headmaster left 
his wife and children two years later and ran away with the school 
secretary.'' In another case, writer Anne Bernays was sued when she 
unknowingly used a real person's name for an unsavory fictional character 
she had created. That case was settled out of court. For most writers, 
what matters is not the morality of stealing from real life, but the 
final product: good writing at any price. Malamud once said in an 
interview: ``If they are going to absorb real people in their fiction, 
they ought to lay aside malice and get their best invention going. 
Without invention, biographical details remain merely strings of uncooked 
spaghetti.''
