World leaders often attend summit meetings to deal with subjects ranging 
from peace to economic issues to humanitarian issues. But VOA's Southern 
African correspondent Alex Balida reports the summit was held Thursday 
in Johannesburg with an altogether different focus. It was called 
the moral summit, a gathering of South African political and religious 
leaders convened to address what President Nelson Mandela has identified 
as the corroding moral fabric of South African society. In a speech 
to the meeting, Mr. Mandela blamed much of the problem on the country's 
racially divided past. As he put it, apartheid was a sin and encouraged 
sinful behavior. But he said that what he called South Africa's spiritual 
malaise was still evident in such areas as corruption in government, 
crime and especially domestic violence, tax evasion and the refusal 
of many South Africans to pay for the services they use. He said his 
government has given its highest priority to combating what he described 
as this rock, which he said continues at unacceptable levels. But 
he admitted that while official efforts have scored some successes, 
these efforts, so far, have been insufficient. Against that backdrop, 
the summit endorsed a code of conduct committing political leaders 
to act with integrity, incorruptibility, impartiality, openness and 
accountability. The national religious leaders' forum, which organized 
the meeting also called on all South Africans to place the good of 
the community above self interest, to strive to help others in the 
spirit of service to show respect to others and to be honest and trustworthy.
