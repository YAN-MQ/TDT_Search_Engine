Like Ziegfeld making an inspection in size 6 Bottega Veneta flats, 
Bette Midler paraded through the workrooms of a set-construction studio 
on West 22d Street, stopping to glue a gold paillette on a floral 
backdrop already blooming in sequins. Pleased with the paint crew's 
progress, she wandered over to a worktable to try on a pair of white 
feather, angel-wing opera gloves last seen at a Victoria's Secret 
fashion show. ``Those are very Harlette-y,'' the singer said, referring 
to the Harlettes, her famously tawdry backup group. Then she spotted 
some foam spider costumes being built for an Eliot Feld ballet. She 
made a mental note to call the choreographer. Perhaps the oversize 
arachnids could be incorporated into her latest extravaganza, too. 
Creating a hubbub on a rainy afternoon, Ms. Midler was not preparing 
for a concert tour in support of her latest album, ``Bathhouse Betty'' 
_ that's still months away. She was working on another ambitious undertaking: 
the stage set for Hulaween II: The Sequel, also known as the Makeover 
Ball. The evening, to be held October 30, is a benefit for the New 
York Restoration Project, an urban beautification group Ms. Midler 
founded in 1994. Determined to outdo last year's Polynesian-style 
dinner-dance, which raised $1 million, Ms. Midler and her cohorts 
are transforming the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria into a hellish 
version of Canyon Ranch crossed with a batty Betty Ford Clinic. ``We're 
calling it the Hootz Spa,'' Ms. Midler said. This year guests who 
ante up $500 to $2,500 a plate will find themselves in a cooler clime 
than last year's Big Island soiree _ somewhere between Baden-Baden 
and Worsen-Worsen. ``We have the pampering, with a horrible twist,'' 
Ms. Midler said. ``It's very sort of Northern, Swiss, Austrian _ I 
hate to say German. It's kind of `The Island of Dr. Morose.''' The 
expected 1,200 guests are being encouraged to ``come as you wish you 
were,'' to drink ``colla-gin and tonics'' and to feast on Dermabraised 
Chicken, Ebola Soup and Mad Cow Pies with members of the Von Trapped 
Family Singers. Call it camp for a cause. A singer whose most enduring 
stage persona is that of a disco-loving mermaid in a wheelchair, Ms. 
Midler has grafted the flamboyant sensibility of her concerts onto 
what could have been a staid, nature-lover's benefit. The Makeover 
Ball, like the first Hulaween, may not be the largest fund-raiser, 
but it is one of the quirkiest. Where else can Manhattan's greenest 
swells (swellest greens?) bid on plastic surgery consultations, with 
Rosie O'Donnell serving as auctioneer? Last year's luau-themed event, 
also held at the Waldorf, was like prom night at Trader Vic's crossed 
with Honolulu's tourist-y Kodak Hula Show. Ms. Midler, who grew up 
in Hawaii, performed not only her hits but also her infamously ribald 
version of the ``Hawaiian War Chant,'' recorded on her 1977 album 
``Live at Last.'' As she erupted into song so did the stage. ``We 
were very proud of our volcano,'' she said. For the Makeover Ball, 
her costume will likely be a kind of vaudeville variation on nurse's 
whites. Last week, she visited Parson-Meares Ltd., a costume shop 
on West 19th Street, where she was fitted in a low-cut uniform with 
a short crinoline skirt and a matching nurse's cap. ``People want 
me to come in a fat suit, but I don't know if I want to go that far,'' 
Ms. Midler said. Ms. Midler has always pushed the boundaries of taste. 
Before her movie success in such 1980s comedies as ``Ruthless People'' 
and ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills,'' she built her career on outrageousness. 
She got her start playing to towel-clad gay men at New York's Continental 
Baths in the '70s. In further camp displays, she has emerged from 
a clam shell on national television and sung ``Lullaby of Broadway'' 
while perched in King Kong's hairy hand, The outlandish nature of 
Friday's Makeover Ball is pure Midler, too. She chose the benefit's 
cosmetic theme because ``makeovers are on everyone's minds these days, 
and it's so cheap and cheesy,'' she said. ``I love it when the people 
being made over look better before some crew got a hold of them.'' 
As for plastic surgery, Ms. Midler said: ``People just love it. I 
think it's a scream.'' Asked if she herself has gone under the knife, 
the actress turned coy. ``I had a wart removed,'' she said. ``I had 
an ingrown toenail removed. I have a very dainty Caesarean scar ... 
'' She is ``conflicted'' about her own exotic features, she said, 
quickly adding: ``Everyone in our society is conflicted. I've made 
my peace with myself. I like stylishness way more than prettiness 
anyway.'' On stage, however, Ms. Midler is always proclaiming her 
beauty. ``I look good,'' was the refrain of her last concert tour. 
``The limelight is very forgiving. The lights are really bright and 
the audience is really far away.'' With the Makeover Ball and her 
new album, Ms. Midler is returning to her roots as an entertainer. 
``Bathhouse Betty,'' her first CD for Warner Brothers after decades 
with Atlantic, harks back to her earliest recordings. She got the 
title when a drunken fan outside her California beach house started 
shouting for Bathhouse Betty to come out and play. ``He was loaded,'' 
she said. ``It was Laguna. You know how they get.'' Her new label 
asked for a more eclectic CD than her last, ``Bette of Roses,'' a 
collection of romantic ballads released in 1995. ``I said: `You want 
variety? Well, stand back!''' Ms. Midler recalled. The new CD includes 
a 1925 Hawaiian ditty and some light rap amid songs written by such 
heartbreak heavyweights as Leonard Cohen, Carole King and Ben Folds. 
Billboard magazine called the aural smorgasbord ``a testament to Midler's 
immense talents.'' Although pleased about the good reviews, Ms. Midler 
still proudly calls herself the Queen of Trash. Her next movie is 
a bio-pic about the potboiling author Jacqueline Susann. And she considers 
her greatest achievement to be the work her Restoration Project has 
done to spruce up New York, particularly the north side of Fort Tryon 
park, above the Cloisters. A staff of 50 workers has removed 2,000 
tons of debris, including cars, refrigerators, and 2,000 tires from 
project sites in northern Manhattan and Long Island. ``I cried when 
I saw it,'' she said. ``It's 4,000 percent better.'' Parks and Recreation 
Commissioner Henry Stern said, ``Ms. Midler is doing in the '90s for 
the parks of northern Manhattan what was done in the '70s for Central 
Park. . We think she's divine.'' Sounding like Auntie Mame on a Martha 
Stewart bender, Ms. Midler said her dream was to turn New York into 
a city as glorious with greenery as Paris. ``Where are the Luxembourg 
Gardens?'' she asked. ``Where's L'Orangerie? Where's ours?'' With 
manic zeal and a chunk of her own money, the adoptive mother to several 
stretches of metro-area highway has been working toward that goal 
since she, her husband Martin Von Hasselberg and their daughter, Sophie, 
moved back from Los Angeles in 1994. Ms. Midler, whose organization 
has raised $2.5 million for renewal projects, said she has wanted 
to clean up the city for 26 years. ``I tried to do garbage in 1972,'' 
she said. ``I asked John Lindsay and he turned me down because he 
thought I only wanted publicity.'' Her idea was to pay the city to 
put her logo on garbage trucks and get others to do the same. Ms. 
Midler is not sure the war on garbage is winnable. But what the heck. 
``You just can't lie down and not put up a fight,'' she said. ``Nature 
is the only place where you can gather yourself again. It makes you 
human again. I actually believe that when people are on a beautiful 
highway they feel better. I think they're kinder to their fellow man.''
