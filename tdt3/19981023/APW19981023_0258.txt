Thousands of anti-government demonstrators braved the threat of arrest 
Friday to gather at the national mosque for a rally demanding political 
reforms. Protesters waved their fists and shouted ``Reform!'', while 
passing cars honked in rhythm with the opposition rally cry. Hundreds 
hopped on motorcycles, their helmets over their white caps donned 
for Friday afternoon prayers, and headed toward Parliament, where 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was unveiling the 1999 budget. But 
they never made it. Dozens of riot police moved in and dispersed the 
crowd with water cannon. Police had warned those who joined the anti-government 
march could face arrest under the Internal Security Act, which allows 
indefinite detainment without trial. The demonstrators are supporters 
of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, ousted as deputy prime minister 
and finance minister on Sept. 2. Police have declared illegal all 
demonstrations in support of Anwar, who is awaiting trial on charges 
of graft and sexual misconduct. So far, authorities have detained 
262 people who have attended anti-government rallies, releasing them 
on bail pending trial. City police chief Kamaruddin Ali said that 
no one had applied for permit to hold Friday's demonstration, as required 
by law in this Southeast Asian country. ``We charged ... people on 
Wednesday for illegal assembly and will not hesitate to do the same 
again,'' Kamaruddin was quoted as saying in Friday editions of The 
Star. On Wednesday, a local court ordered the trial of 127 people 
who were arrested for participating in a demonstration that demanded 
Mahathir's resignation. Since Anwar's arrest last month, tens of thousands 
of Malaysians have gathered regularly in the capital and other cities 
to demand justice for the jailed politician. Anwar, who showed up 
at his first court appearance bruised and beaten, faces trial Nov. 
2 on 10 counts of corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He has condemned 
the charges as false and politically motivated. The political scandal 
and apparent police brutality against Anwar have soured political 
relations with other nations. The presidents of Indonesia and the 
Philippines have expressed sympathy with the dissident. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton won't meet with Mahathir during the APEC summit because 
of U.S. concerns over the handling of Anwar, administration sources 
said Thursday. The U.S. House International Affairs Committee released 
a letter Thursday to Clinton from committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman 
and Rep. Doug Bereuter urging the president to speak ``forcefully' 
about human rights in Malaysia. Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah 
Ahmad Badawi called the comments by the congressmen arrogant. ``They 
should realize that they are the ones who are being highly offensive 
towards Malaysia,'' he said.
