Commuters who zone out by staring out the window on one stretch of 
Berlin subway actually will be tuning in _ to movies flashing on the 
tunnel walls. The subway cinema premiered Friday with cartoon characters, 
but creators expect to change the film periodically. Most _ about 
70 percent _ will be advertisements. The effect is created by about 
900 projectors mounted in the tunnel casting pictures on a special 
white background. Here's the trick: the pictures don't move _ but 
the speeding train makes them look like they do. Commuters will have 
to pay attention: the show lasts about 30 seconds from the central 
Zoo station to Hansaplatz, north of the city's Tiergarten park. That's 
30 pictures per second at speeds of 65 kilometers (40 miles) an hour, 
calculates creator Joerg Moser-Metius. MetroCinevision, which is developing 
the project, plans to install the system in subway tunnels in Paris 
and London.
