Would you have invested your money in the NFL bonds? do you know what 
a bond is? Are you sure? Is it the most luxurious? One with a leather-trimmed 
and preferred suede interior. Heated front seats and dual zone temperature 
control. Or is it America's lowest priced minivan... that still includes 
featur ES like easy out roller seats and...air conditioning. There's 
only one place to choose from the complete selection of award winning 
minivans... your Chrysler and Plymouth dealer. Hey, I got a letter 
back from quaker. You wrote to quaker? Yeah. I told 'em quaker toasted 
oatmeal... oughta be called quaker tasty oatmeal. It's oatmeal. It's 
toasted. to me, that says "tasty." Well, then they should call it 
that. You need a hobby. Quaker toasted oatmeal. Deliciously crisp 
oatmeal flakes with honey-sweetened oat clusters. So what does quaker 
say? Well, they thanked me for my interest but said, "product will 
remain quaker toasted oatmeal." What a shock. Quaker tasty-- uh, toasted 
oatmeal and quaker oatmeal squares.
