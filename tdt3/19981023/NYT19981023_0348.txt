For 13 years, the case against the convicted spy Jonathan Jay Pollard 
has symbolized darker aspects of the normally warm relationship between 
the United States and Israel while exposing fissures long dividing 
American and Israeli Jews. Time and again, the Pollard case has emerged 
from the diplomatic wings and crept toward center stage whenever U.S. 
and Israeli leaders have sat down to talk. Rarely, though, has it 
been the dominant force that it suddenly became on Friday, when it 
looked for a while as though it might unsettle the latest peace agreement 
between Israel and the Palestinians. Yet despite strong emotions produced 
by Pollard's life sentence in prison, in both Israel and this country, 
the exact nature of his crimes has never been fully clear. Supporters 
demanding his release from a federal prison in North Carolina say 
he has served more than enough time, arguing that he handed Israel 
strategic information that in their view the United States should 
have been sharing with an ally from the start. On the other side are 
officials in U.S. security agencies and the Justice Department who 
say it is impossible to overstate the damage that Pollard's espionage 
inflicted on U.S. intelligence-gathering in the Middle East and possibly 
also in the former Soviet Union. But they have never elaborated or 
opened government files laying out precisely what he had done, except 
to say it was serious _ a view that thus far has been sustained by 
three U.S. presidents: Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton. 
The fact that Pollard acted in behalf of a friendly nation is irrelevant, 
the chief prosecutor in the Pollard case, Joseph diGenova, said Friday. 
``The United States doesn't have two standards for spying,'' said 
diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. ``It's 
all bad.''
