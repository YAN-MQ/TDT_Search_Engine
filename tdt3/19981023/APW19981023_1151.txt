UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the 
Middle East peace agreement Friday and expressed hope that it will 
lead to a comprehensive peace agreement for the region. ``I am delighted 
at the news that the impasse in the Middle East peace process has 
finally been broken,'' he said in a statement. Annan, who is visiting 
South Korea, congratulated Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ``for having had the courage to 
make the compromises necessary for peace.'' And he paid tribute to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, King Hussein of Jordan ``and all those 
who put in so much effort to make this achievement possible.'' ``I 
hope that this will lead to renewed efforts to conclude a comprehensive 
peace for the region as a whole,'' Annan said. Under the deal announced 
Friday afternoon, the Palestinians would eliminate anti-Israel provisions 
in their founding charter and the Israelis would cede 13 percent more 
of the territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River and free 750 
alleged political prisoners, U.S. and Palestinian officials said.
