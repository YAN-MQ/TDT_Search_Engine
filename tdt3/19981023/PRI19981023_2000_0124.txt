NATO is sending another high level delegation to Belgrade to warn 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that time is running out to 
comply with the Kosovo peace deal. The alliance has extended until 
next Tuesday, the deadline for Milosevic to comply with the agreement, 
which was negotiated under the threat of NATO air strikes. Five more 
counties have been added to the 20 that had already been declared 
federal disaster areas in Texas as a result of the recent severe flooding 
there. Nearly 30 deaths are being attributed to the floods and the 
storms that have hit the state. Texas Governor George W. Bush and 
Federal Disaster Chief James Lee Witt visited some of the hardest 
hit areas today.
