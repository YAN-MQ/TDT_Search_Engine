Russia says it will vote against a U.N. security council resolution 
that would allow NAto to intervene in Yugoslavia if monitors in the 
province of kosovo come into danger. The motion is supported by the 
United States and other countries. But Russia claims it violates the 
U.N. charter. NAto is sending its supreme commander to Yugoslavia 
to warn president slobodan Milosevic to comply with an agreement to 
remove his troops from kosovo by Tuesday.
