Pete Sampras' hopes of retaining his world No. 1 spot at the end of 
the year took a knock Friday when a back injury forced him to withdraw 
from the Lyon Grand Prix. Sampras pulled out of the dlrs 750,000 event 
before he was due to face Germany's Tommy Haas in a quarterfinal match. 
On Thursday, Sampras had appeared in top form as he fired 10 aces 
in a decisive 6-2, 6-4 second-round win over Australia's Todd Woodbridge. 
But the three-time winner of the Lyon event started to feel pain Friday 
morning, and said he had no choice but to withdraw. ``I felt a pain 
originally in the first set against Todd Martin in the first round,'' 
a dejected Sampras told reporters at a news conference. ``I continued 
to play on but I felt it getting worse, and last night and this morning 
I had pretty substantial spasms,'' he said. ``It's best to rest and 
hopefully take care of the problem over the next few days.'' Sampras 
will fly immediately to Stuttgart, where the Eurocard Open begins 
on Monday. Sampras said he was frustrated, after having come back 
to top form in recent weeks. ``I have never had back problems like 
this. It's unfortunate, I was playing well,'' he said. Sampras currently 
has 4,327 points on the ATP tour, ahead of Marcelo Rios with 3,674 
and Patrick Rafter with 3,593 points. The Lyon Grand Prix winner gets 
200 points. To hold on to the year-end No. 1 spot he's held for the 
past five years, ``the next two weeks are very important,'' he said. 
``I would have loved to carry on the roll I am on now, but sometimes 
you have to listen to your body as much as your mind. But I am not 
panicked. I hope to get this thing better by next week.'' ``If I played 
on I might get a serious injury that might jeopardize the rest of 
the year and I don't want to do that,'' Sampras said. ``A body isn't 
meant to play tennis as much as I play tennis. It's just a matter 
of getting through.'' Sampras has a vertebral injury midway down his 
back, said tournament doctor Claude de Roche. ``It is difficult to 
say whether he will be fit for Stuttgart,'' de Roche told The Associated 
Press. ``At this time we do not know the gravity of the injury. But 
a player doesn't get to be No. 1 for five years by being fragile,'' 
he said. De Roche added that the very hard surface in Lyon could have 
contributed to the injury.
