TODAY'S KEY GAMES No. 2 UCLA (5-0) at CALIFORNIA (4-2) The Bruins 
could be upset by worse. The Bears give up just 18.7 points a game 
and their defeats have come against Washington (21-13) and Nebraska 
(24-3). UCLA quarterback Cade McNown has a chance to snowball his 
Heisman momentum after a 395-yard, 3-touchdown performance in last 
week's 41-38 overtime victory over Oregon. No. 5 FLORIDA STATE (6-1) 
No. 6 at GEORGIA TECH (5-1) The Seminoles' national and Atlantic Coast 
Conference championship hopes face a serious threat. Tech leads the 
league in scoring at 40.8 points per game. Florida State leads the 
nation in total defense at 214.1 yards a game. What is with the Yellow 
Jackets' bend and bend some more defense? The unit surrendered 600 
yards to Virginia last week but has scored in five straight games, 
a major college record. No. 15 MISSOURI (5-1) at No. 8 NEBRASKA (6-1) 
The Cornhuskers have been vulnerable against the rush, and Missouri 
is capable of capitalizing. Devin West (175 yards a game) leads a 
Tiger team averaging 266.3 yards on the ground. Of course, Nebraska 
still has a running game of its own, averaging 270.4 yards. The loser 
in this Big 12 North showdown can probably say goodbye to any chance 
of beating Kansas State to the conference championship game. TEXAS 
TECH (6-1) at No. 7 TEXAS A&AMP;M (6-1) The Aggies have kept improving 
after a season-opening defeat to Florida State. Saturday, A&AMP;M's 
Butkus semifinalist, Dat Nguyen (70 tackles), seeks out Tech's Ricky 
Williams, the nation's third-leading rusher with 1,168 yards. The 
Red Raiders can grab a share of the Big 12's South division lead with 
a victory. MIAMI (3-2) at NO. 16 WEST VIRGINIA (4-2) This is the Big 
East's most important game of the week. Still not moved? The Mountaineers 
begin a telling stretch with Virginia Tech and Syracuse to follow. 
They will likely have the services of Amos Zereoue, who needs 139 
yards to become the league's all-time rusher. West Virginia's Marc 
Bulger is throwing for a conference best 278 yards a game. The Hurricanes 
had last week off to heal from a humbling 26-14 defeat to Florida 
State. OTHER GAMES EAST Tulane (5-0) at Rutgers (3-3) The Scarlet 
Knights' confidence is rising after a Big East road victory over Pittsburgh, 
but the Conference U.S.A.-leading Green Wave is probably too quick. 
Columbia (2-3) at Yale (2-3) The Lions go the rest of the way with 
backups at quarterback and middle linebacker. Colgate (4-2) at Fordham 
(2-4) The Red Raiders, fresh off a narrow defeat to Division 1-A Navy, 
try to avoid an emotional trough against the pass-happy Rams. MIDWEST 
No. 11 Wisconsin (7-0) at Iowa (3-4) The Badgers' workhorse running 
back, Ron Dayne (834 yards), is finally working at full strength, 
Coach Barry Alvarez said. Colorado (6-1) at Kansas (2-5) The Buffaloes 
are not one of Coach Rick Neuheisel's better editions, but they are 
still Big 12 contenders. Army (2-4) at No. 20 Notre Dame (4-1) Only 
the Irish could generate talk about a Rose Bowl appearance with such 
modest success at such a premature point. Michigan (4-2) at Indiana 
(3-3) The Wolverines have allowed a shade under 11 points a game in 
their three Big Ten victories. SOUTH North Carolina State (4-2) at 
Virginia (5-1) The Wolfpack vascillates from world-beaters to crow-eaters. 
Which will show up for this possible ACC title elimination bout? Alabama 
(4-2) at No. 4 Tennessee (5-0) After a week off, the Volunteers could 
use a splashy victory to remind pollsters they are still alive. Mississippi 
State (5-1) at Louisiana State (3-3) The Bulldogs can take over the 
West division lead in the Southeastern Conference while Arkansas takes 
a breather. SOUTHWEST Baylor (2-4) at Texas (4-2) The Longhorns' Ricky 
Williams, who is averaging 204.2 yards a game rushing, said he is 
girding himself for not receiving the Heisman. WEST Southern Cal (5-2) 
at No. 14 Oregon (5-1) The Ducks and their high-flying offense (48.5 
points per game) look to regroup after a 41-38 overtime loss to UCLA. 
MISMATCHES No. 1 Ohio State (6-0) at Northwestern (2-5) Buckeyes Coach 
John Cooper has been hyping his quiet quarterback, Joe Germaine, for 
the Heisman. Saturday is a chance for Germaine to talk with eye-popping 
statistics. Iowa State (2-4) at Kansas State (6-0) Dan McCarney, the 
Cyclones' coach, said of the Wildcats, `'They've got it all.''
