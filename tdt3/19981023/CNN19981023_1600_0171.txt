In other news -- Texas governor George W. bush is telling residents 
of flood-ravaged Texas there's a brighter day coming. Today, bush 
got a firsthand look at damage from flooding that has buried the towns 
of Victoria and Cuero under water. He surveyed the scene from the 
air and on the ground, accompanied by FEMA director James Lee witt. 
Flooding and tornadoes in central and south Texas have killed 29 people 
and caused half a billion in damage. Witt added five more counties 
to the 20 eligible for federal aid.
