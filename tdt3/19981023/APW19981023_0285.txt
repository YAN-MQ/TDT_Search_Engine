Turkish troops killed 69 Kurdish rebels in eastern Turkey in clashes 
that also left 10 solders dead, officials said Friday. Fighting started 
Wednesday in the regions of Van, Siirt and Sirnak, which border Iraq 
and Iran. Kurdish rebels, fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast, 
often wage cross-border operations from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria. 
Turkish officials claim that Syria has agreed to shut down rebel camps 
in Syria and in Syrian-controlled parts of Lebanon. The agreement 
followed a Turkish-Syrian crisis that raised fears of a regional conflict. 
Some 37,000 people have been killed since the Kurdish insurgency began 
in 1984.
