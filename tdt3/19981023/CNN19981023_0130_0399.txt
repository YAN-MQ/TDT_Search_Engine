First lady Hillary Clinton campaigned in Detroit Thursday. She was 
stumping for democratic candidates while paying as little attention 
as possible to gubernatorial candidate Geoffrey feiger. Feiger is 
best known as the lawyer for retired pathologist Jack Kevorkian. He 
has also raised eyebrows for saying outrageous and sometimes offensive 
things in public. Democrats worry his presence at the top of the ticket 
will turn off voters.
