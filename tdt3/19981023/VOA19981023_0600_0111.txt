Iranians are going to the polls today to elect a group of Shiite theologians 
responsible for appointing Iran's supreme ruler. Senior Iranian leaders 
have urged a massive turnout, but many Iranians said they did not 
plan to vote because many allies of moderate President Mohamad Hatami 
were disqualified from running by a conservative screening board. 
Approximately 39 million Iranians over the age of 16 are eligible 
to participate in the election of the 86 members of body known as 
The Assembly of Experts.
