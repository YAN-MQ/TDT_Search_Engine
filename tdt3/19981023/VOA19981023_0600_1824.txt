Hello. Hello, again, from Washington. I'm Elizabeth Arat, along with 
Imani Crosby. After eight days of negotiations, there are reports 
that Israel and the Palestinians are about to conclude an accord that 
would clear away obstacles to a further Israeli troop withdrawal from 
the West Bank. VOA's Nick Simione brings up to date on marathon peace 
talks that are underway in the Eastern U.S. state of Maryland. All 
night long, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader Yassir Arafat met together with their top aides and with President 
Clinton to hammer out an accord with Mr. Clinton pulling an all- night 
19-hour negotiating session, one that U.S. officials suggest is now 
close to paying off. Just before dawn Friday, reports emerged quoting 
unnamed Palestinians as saying that after eight full days of negotiations 
here, a peace agreement was being drafted and would be signed later 
Friday. U.S. officials will say only that an agreement is close. But 
as one put it, we are not there yet. Hours earlier, Israeli and Palestinian 
sources said agreement had, in fact, been reached on revising the 
PLO charter to wipe out calls for Israel's destruction. But on that 
point, as well, U.S. officials would only say substantial progress 
had been made, but that a half dozen or so other issues still needed 
to be resolved before Israel would withdraw from another 13 percent 
of West Bank land. Vick Simione, VOA News at the Middle East peace 
talks, in Wye Mills, Maryland.
