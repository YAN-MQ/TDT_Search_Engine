When the Yankees got that welcome home, one member of the team had 
a longer road to the celebration than all of the others. Hernando 
Hernandez, there is so much more to his story. The Canyon of heroes. 
Look closely, and you will see a man who defines the American dream. 
El duque! Orlando Hernandez! a hero today, a world away from his life 
in Cuba less than a year ago. Once known as Cuba's finest pitcher, 
he was banned from playing ball his livelihood, because officials 
feared he would defect. Without baseball, he lived on Havana's poorest 
streets making $10 a month. Then December 26th, a Gray day, a small 
makeshift raft. Hernandez and seven others would flee Cuba. Eventually, 
freedom in the states, a warm reception from his brother, livan, who 
had defected in 1995. And then the New York Yankees hired him and 
returned El duque to the mound. Finally, last Sunday, only ten months 
after his escape from Cuba, he helped his new team win the world series. 
Early this morning, a storybook ending, a stunning reunion. Castro 
allowed Hernandez's mother and daughters to leave Cuba and share his 
victory.
