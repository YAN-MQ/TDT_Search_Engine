The Dow industrials snap a big winning streak. Beverly Schuch has 
the closing market numbers from New York. bev? After seven winning 
days for the Dow industrials, it was time for a break. The blue chips 
spent all of the day firmly in Negative territory. Investors locked 
in profits from the 600-point gain of the seven previous sessions. 
For the week the Dow gained 35 points. The broader markets also drifted 
lower, with the NASDAQ composite losing -- eight points. One analyst 
said investors should take today's sell-off in stride. The amount 
of cash available for investing is huge. And there is a lot of money 
sitting out there on the sidelines right now in money market funds 
that will find its way into stocks. And maybe not right in the short 
term, but it will find its way back into the market.
