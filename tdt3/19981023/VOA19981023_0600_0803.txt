Officials in the U.S. state of Texas are now blaming this past week's 
flooding and tornadoes for 27 deaths. The bodies of five more people 
were found Thursday. The waters are receding in much of the affected 
areas, but continue to rise in a few communities. More from VOA's 
correspondent Michael Leland. Four of the five bodies were found in 
a single car at the bottom of a rain-swollen creek in the city of 
San Antonio. A man, his girlfriend, their two-month-old daughter and 
his grandmother were last seen leaving a wedding reception Saturday 
night. They drove through a storm that dumped nearly 50 centimeters 
of rain on the city by Sunday evening. Officials say their car was 
most likely swept off the road and into the creek by the flash flood. 
Officials on Thursday also found the body of a seven-year-old boy 
who'd been missing since Saturday, as well. Texans are calling this 
the worst flooding in the state in decades. By Tuesday, 1/4 of the 
state was under water. Damage, so far, is estimated at $400 million, 
a figure that's expected to rise as the water recedes and water-logged 
buildings can be inspected. President Clinton has declared 20 Texas 
counties disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid. In 
East Central Texas, the flood worries continue as high water moves 
toward the Gulf of Mexico. Official in the town of Wharton, about 
70 kilometers southwest of Houston, watched the Colorado River reach 
record heights throughout the day Thursday. It's not expected to crest 
until some time Friday, by which time 40 percent of the town could 
be under water. Wharton County is the leading rice-producing region 
in Texas. Farmers had already harvest one crop this year, but were 
hoping to harvest a 12,000 hector second crop in the near future. 
Officials estimate about half of that second crop has now been lost.
