Iranians are going to the polls today to elect the group of Shiite 
theologians responsible for appointing Iran's suprem -- supreme ruler. 
Iranian leaders have urged a massive voter turnout to choose the body, 
which is known as The Assembly of Experts. They say a large showing 
would discourage Iran's enemies and reinforce the power of the country's 
clerical authorities. But many Iranians told reporters they did not 
plan to vote. They expressed disappointment that many allies of moderate 
President Mohamad Hatami were disqualified from running by a conservative 
screening board. Few observers say they expect the election to lead 
to any change in the conservatives' control of the body or in the 
broad powers of Ayatola Alet Hamani, who was appointed supreme leader 
by the Assembly of Experts in 1989. Approximately 39 million Iranians 
over the age of 16 are eligible to vote for the 86 members of the 
assembly.
