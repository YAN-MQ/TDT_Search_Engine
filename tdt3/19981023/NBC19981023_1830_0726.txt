And when we come back -- 77 years old and just days away from hitching 
an historic ride on the space shuttle. You could leave just a little 
bit over at every meal, it would really add up. Imagine what you could 
avoid eating in a single month. If you're significantly overweight 
your doctor has a way to help you. It's called meridia, and it can 
help you lose weight and keep it off. You've got to do your part. 
You've got to do your part with diet and exercise, but meridia can 
help. Meridia is a prescription medicine and it's not for everyone. 
It can substantially raise blood pressure and it's not for people 
who are pregnant or nursing, under 16, or taking anything else for 
weight loss depression, Parkinson's disease, migraines, or for people 
with glaucoma, anorexia, seizures, or serious heart, liver or kidney 
problems. It's a controlled substance, so some patients may experience 
limited dependence. Side effects may include headache, constipation, 
insomnia and dry mouth. For more information, ask your doctor or call 
I'm ready. Meridia. you do your part ...we'll do ours.
