The national church arson task force says there is no evidence of 
a National conspiracy to burn houses of worship. The task force was 
created because of the numerous highly publicized attacks especially 
on black Churches in the south. Of 670 suspicious church fires, bombings 
or attempted bombings, 225 targeted black Churches. Thursday's report 
says incidents are declining. 208 suspicious fires were investigated 
last year. This year, 114 such fires were reported through September 
8th. This is a success story. We have come together as different levels 
of government, as a nation, and as people, to confront arsons. When 
this task force started out, we didn't know what the picture was. 
Now there is a very clear picture. Arsons are declining. Law enforcement 
is working together. And communities of faith are being rebuilt. Of 
the 235 people convicted in connection with church fires 54 were found 
guilty of hate crimes.
