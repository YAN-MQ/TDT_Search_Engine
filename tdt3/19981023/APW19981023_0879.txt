Volkswagen said Friday that it will invest 500 million pounds (dlrs 
847.6 million) at the Rolls-Royce and Bentley plant in Crewe, England 
over the next five years. VW paid 479 million pounds (dlrs 790 million) 
for Rolls-Royce and Bentley in early July, then sold the rights for 
the name Rolls-Royce to BMW after agreeing that VW could use the name 
for free until Dec. 31, 2002. After that BMW will take the name and 
create a new Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., and VW will continue producing 
the Bentley line of luxury cars at Crewe. While VW plans to increase 
output of Bentley cars to 9,000 units in the medium term, it will 
leave the production of Rolls-Royce cars at current levels, board 
member Robert Buechelhofer said at a meeting of worldwide dealers 
in Crewe Friday.
