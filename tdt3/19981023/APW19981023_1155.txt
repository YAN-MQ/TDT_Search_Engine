Germany's Greens are about to join the government, but not without 
the kind of squabbling dear to the former protest party since its 
founding 18 years ago. After last month's election victory by the 
Social Democrats, Greens leaders swiftly grasped power at the national 
level for the first time, sealing a coalition pact after surprisingly 
smooth negotiations. Both parties are expected to ratify the deal 
this weekend at special conventions in Bonn, clearing final hurdles 
for Germany's first left-leaning government in 16 years. While the 
Social Democrats' vote is likely to go smoothly, many Greens members 
are upset that Schroeder nixed radical goals such as a sharp hike 
in gasoline taxes and a timetable for scrapping nuclear power. Reflecting 
queasiness among party activists, the three Greens tapped for Cabinet 
posts faced accusations Friday that they are amassing power. Still, 
Greens leaders expected delegates to back the coalition Saturday as 
the best deal they could get as junior partner. Party co-chair Gunda 
Roestel opened their meeting Friday with a plea to some 750 delegates 
to reconcile their anti-establishment roots with the chance to govern 
Europe's biggest nation. ``Assuming you approve, a new chapter in 
postwar German history will start Monday,'' she said. ``This new chapter 
will bear Green handwriting.'' ``Of course we had to swallow things 
we didn't like,'' she said. But, she added, ``this is a chance for 
our party to grow into a new role.'' The biggest controversy could 
be set off by delegates who argue that Trittin and the two other future 
Greens ministers are acting too much like mainstream politicians in 
insisting that they also hold on to their seats in parliament. Designated 
foreign minister Joschka Fischer, the most prominent Greens leader, 
has already hinted he'll turn down the Cabinet post if delegates vote 
Saturday to bar the dual role. Touching indirectly on the topic, Trittin 
told delegates Friday that the Greens must modernize their approach 
to power now that they will no longer be an opposition party. He said 
the Greens, founded in 1980 by pacifists, anti-nuclear activists and 
feminists, need to make ``a new political start.'' Denying Green ministers 
a foot in parliament would weaken the party compared to the Social 
Democrats, Trittin said earlier. But Peter Swane, the party's leader 
in Schleswig-Holstein state, kept up pressure on the future Cabinet 
members. ``I know from talking with many colleagues in the national 
party that this issue is a very sensitive point,'' he said on German 
radio. ``This topic is almost more important than some points that 
may be controversial in the coalition agreement.'' Schroeder is to 
be sworn in Tuesday, a day after the new parliament convenes. Social 
Democrats and Greens have promised shifts on several fronts. Chief 
projects are to work toward shutting down nuclear plants, cut taxes 
for people with low and medium incomes, and allow more foreigners 
to become citizens.
