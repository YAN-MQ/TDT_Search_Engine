Parliament's lower house passed a resolution Friday that backs plans 
to build a Roman Catholic church honoring Poland's democratic tradition, 
a project first envisioned more than 200 years ago. Roman Catholic 
leaders recently have appealed to parliament to revive plans for the 
sanctuary long delayed by history: Poland's partition, World War II, 
a communist regime. Polish-born Pope John Paul II, credited for inspiring 
Poland's return to democracy after more than 40 years of communism, 
is expected to dedicate the church during his visit next summer. ``The 
Holy Providence Church will be a symbol of the nation's gratitude 
for regaining freedom in 1989, for Pope John Paul II's 20 years as 
pontiff, and for 2,000 years of Christianity,'' said the resolution 
supported by 243 center and right-wing deputies. Some 20 leftist, 
arguing that parliament should not be involved in religious matters, 
voted against, while 72 others abstained. Poland's last king, Stanislaw 
August Poniatowski, laid the cornerstone for the original church intended 
to dedicate Poland's first democratic constitution, enacted May 3, 
1791. It was the first drafted in the tradition of the U.S. constitution. 
The project was halted when Poland was partitioned in 1795 by Austria, 
Russia and Prussia. After regaining independence following World War 
I, Poland's parliament renewed the pledge, but the project was never 
carried out. Parliament's upper house, the Senate, revived the plans 
in 1991, two years after Poland again adopted democracy following 
four decades of communism. The Senate approved the plans in June. 
A small monument stands at the site where the church originally was 
to be built, now in the Botanical Gardens. The new church, based on 
modern plans, will be locate in the southern residential suburb of 
Wilanow and funded by private donations in this predominantly Catholic 
nation. Poland's 1,000-year-old Catholic church is credited with preserving 
the national culture during long periods of occupation and lending 
its authority to help the Solidarity trade union, overthrow the communist 
system. However, after 1989, when church leaders pushed through an 
abortion ban and introduced religion classes in schools, more and 
more people argue that the church should stay away from public affairs.
