In the third power shuffle in 22 months at the top of the world's 
fifth largest phone company, Telecom Italia SpA's board on Friday 
named board member Berardino Libonati as new chairman, replacing Gian 
Mario Rossignolo. In a statement Telecom specified that Libonati's 
position as chairman will not include the broad executive powers given 
to Rossignolo. Instead, those powers have been temporarily assigned 
to Telecom's executive committee. Rossignolo was named chairman on 
Jan. 12 and one month later forced out chief executive and longtime 
Telecom executive Tomaso Tommasi di Vignano. And soon after he was 
named chairman, Rossignolo broke off a strategic alliance with the 
U.S. company AT and T. The executive committee told the adminstrative 
board that it is looking to find a chief executive officer shortly. 
Telecom added that negotiations for a digital platform will go forward 
with all interested parties. Earlier this month, the Italian financial 
daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported that Telecom was close to concluding 
an accord with RAI, Italy's state TV network, and Rupert Murdoch's 
British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC (BSy) over its 100 percent-controlled 
digital pay-TV unit stream.
