A new study concludes 3.9 million Americans can not vote because they 
are convicted felons. Human rights watch and the sentencing project 
say mandatory sentencing requirements and stiff drug laws are responsible. 
14 states deny voting rights to felony criminal offenders even after 
they finish their sentences. The groups say if the trend continues 
in 12 states, 30% to 40% of the next generation of black men will 
lose the right to vote.
