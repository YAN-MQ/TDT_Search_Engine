Peru and Ecuador have agreed on terms to end a border dispute that 
has lasted nearly 60 years and caused three wars over one of South 
America's last border flashpoints, diplomatic sources said Friday. 
Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador will 
sign a peace accord on Monday here in Brazil's capital, where the 
negotiations took place, the sources said. The two neighbors fought 
wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over the unmarked border in the jungle-covered 
Cordillera del Condor region. The full border stretches 1,050 miles 
(1,690 kilometers) through mainly jungle terrain. The dispute centered 
on a remote jungle area called Tiwintza, located on a 48-mile (77-kilometer) 
stretch of border that was not defined in the 1942 Rio de Janeiro 
Protocol that set territorial boundaries. Peace talks begin in 1995. 
After years of slow progress, the presidents of the two nations met 
in August to work out the final details. The agreement was confirmed 
by sources of both countries, who asked not to be identified pending 
an official announcement. Although details were not released, the 
accord is based on a proposal elaborated by the four peace brokers: 
Brazil, the United States, Argentina and Chile. Beyond setting the 
boundary between the two nations, it includes an agreement security 
measures and on trade and navigation. The presidents of Brazil, Argentina 
and Chile will attend the signing as will King Juan Carlos and Queen 
Sofia of Spain. The U.S. Embassy in Brasilia said Washington had not 
decided whom to send. As a condition for brokering the peace talks, 
the four nations involved in the talks secured approval in advance 
from the Peruvian and Ecuadoran congresses for any deal negotiated.
