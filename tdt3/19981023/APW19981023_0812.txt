A NATO headquarters for the air surveillance mission over Kosovo is 
likely to be set up near the Macedonian capital, the country's defense 
minister said Friday. Macedonia's defense minister, Lazar Kitanoski, 
told reporters that an Alliance headquarters will probably be established 
at the military airfield and barracks in Kumanovo, about 20 kilometers 
(12 miles) northeast of capital Skopje. Between 100 and 150 NATO personnel 
are expected to be based there, Kitanoski added. ``A NATO experts 
team has been in Macedonia for the past two days to review the conditions 
at the Kumanovo facility and will report back to Brussels,'' Kitanoski 
said. The final decision to begin setting up the base is expected 
to be taken by NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, oon, he also 
said. On Thursday, NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana said the 
Alliance wanted to station a unit in Macedonia and would finalize 
plans for a ``coordination cell'' there. The purpose of the cell would 
be to support NATO's mission to verify Serbian government compliance 
with the deal to end the crisis in neighboring Kosovo. It would also 
serve to provide back-up for the 2,000 unarmed ``verifiers'' who will 
make sure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians 
honor the Oct. 12 agreement to defuse the crisis without NATO airstrikes. 
But an opposition coalition opposed to a NATO role in Macedonia finished 
ahead of the government in the first round of national elections last 
weekend. The final balloting is set for Nov. 1. Kitanoski said the 
deployment of a NATO headquarters on Macedonian territory was not 
a threat to neighboring Serbia, which includes Kosovo, but would represent 
an act of good will on Macedonia's part. ``We are safer with NATO 
than without it,'' Kitanoski replied when asked about the possibility 
of hostile acts from its Balkan neighbor. Macedonia became a member 
of NATO's Partnership for Peace Program in 1995 and wants to join 
the Alliance.
