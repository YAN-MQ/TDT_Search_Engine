The Mexico 1999 Confederations Cup will go on as planned despite the 
decision by world champion France to withdraw from the tournament, 
Mexican soccer officials said Friday. Enrique Borja, president of 
the Mexican soccer federation, said at a news conference he expected 
the Jan. 8-20 FIFA tournament would be held as scheduled with a top-flight 
European team replacing the French. ``We can't think about giving 
up,'' he said. Borja said the Mexican soccer federation would wait 
until FIFA president Joseph Blatter and UEFA president Lennart Johansson 
meet this weekend in Glasgow, Scotland, before making any further 
announcements. Justino Compean, president of the local organizing 
committee, said negotiations had begun with domestic sponsors so that 
they would not pull out of the event. ``Of course, we are very disappointed 
that France will not come,'' he said. ``It was extremely important.'' 
The tournament was to have opened with a repeat of this year's World 
Cup final, with France squaring off against the soccer-loving Brazilians 
in the western city of Guadalajara. But French internationals playing 
in European leagues would have missed domestic matches if they played 
in Mexico. FIFA's tournament of continental champions is considered 
irrelevant and untimely by many European leagues. Other teams participating 
in the tournament are Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, the United States, 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand.
