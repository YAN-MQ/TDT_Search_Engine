BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO decided on Friday to send two top military 
commanders to Belgrade this weekend to warn Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic he has only a few days left to comply with the Kosovo agreement. 
NATO's two top military commanders in Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark 
and German General Klaus Naumann, will insist more Yugoslav special 
police units return to their barracks and take their heavy weapons 
with them, a NATO official said. ``Some units have been withdrawn 
from Kosovo but they are not back in their barracks,'' said the NATO 
official who requested anonymity. ``We have seen great progress but 
we are still far from adequate compliance. It is now a calmer situation 
but unfortunately still not without incident. We expect a lot more 
between now and the deadline,'' he said. NATO is maintaining the threat 
of airstrikes against Serbia until at least next Tuesday in an attempt 
to make sure Milosevic abides by a peace agreement reached Oct. 12 
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. ``We still believe 
Milosevic is able to go faster and do more,'' the official said. NATO 
stressed much progress had already been made on the ground in Kosovo, 
estimating thousands of refugees had been able to return home. Many 
of these homes however have been largely destroyed and have no heat, 
water or power. The two generals are expected to have talks with Milosevic 
on Saturday and be back in Brussels by Sunday to brief the ambassadors 
of the 16 NATO nations. The ambassadors will meet Monday to assess 
the generals' report. Under the Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic is supposed 
to reduce his forces in Kosovo to the levels they were at before the 
crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels started in February.
