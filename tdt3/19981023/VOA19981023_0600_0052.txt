I'm Bill Hazard, VOA News. Middle East Summit is in its ninth day, 
with all sides saying they are close to a new land-for-peace deal. 
News reports quote Palestinian negotiators as saying all issues had 
been resolved and the final text of an agreement is being drawn up. 
However, a U.S. spokesman said the sides are very close to a deal, 
but they are not there yet. President Clinton has been meeting into 
the early morning with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 
Palestinian Leader Yassir Arafat to iron out remaining difficulties. 
State Department Spokesman James Rubin says President Clinton and 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright are involved in the talks. Both 
the president and the secretary have been engaging intensively throughout 
the day in many different ways and we do feel like we're down to a 
serious moment of serious bargaining on serious issues. Other key 
unresolved issues include Palestinian demands for Israel to release 
about 3,000 Arab prisoners.
