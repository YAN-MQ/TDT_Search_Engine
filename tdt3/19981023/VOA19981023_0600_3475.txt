to condoms. Well, now there are also vending machines that sell bait. 
So people who are going fishing don't have to wait for the bait shop 
to op There's a bet finding machines around. Users dropped 10 25 cent 
pieces. That's $2.5 into a machine and make the choice of bate, worms, 
grubs, minnows or whatever. Machines are a product of a company called 
vending consultants. The firm sold only 15 such machines in 1996.
