Randolph Carter, an author who wrote several plays produced on Broadway, 
died on Monday at St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens. He was 90. 
Carter's first Broadway production was ``Arms of Venus'' (1937), based 
on Petronius' ``Satyricon.'' Variety called it ``a tempest in a Roman 
tomb'' and ``an orgy of laughs.'' Carter was associated with J.J. 
Shubert for 10 years, serving as a play doctor and providing dialogue 
for a wide variety of musicals and operettas including ``The Student 
Prince,'' ``Countess Maritza,'' ``The Land of Smiles'' and ``The Merry 
Widow.'' Other Broadway productions included a dramatization of ``Wuthering 
Heights'' in 1940 and ``Eugenia,'' starring Tallulah Bankhead, in 
1957. His ``Florence Nightingale,'' starring Katharine Cornell, was 
presented on radio in 1951 by the Theater Guild on the Air. He also 
adapted ``Wuthering Heights'' for a television production that starred 
Richard Burton and Claire Bloom. In 1984 his adaptation of James T. 
Farrell's ``Death of Nora Ryan'' was presented off-Broadway. From 
1966 to 1969 Carter was the drama critic on the John Wingate news 
program on WOR-TV. He was the author of ``The World of Flo Ziegfeld'' 
(1974) and a monograph, ``Joseph Urban'' (1992).
