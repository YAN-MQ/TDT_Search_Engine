And good Friday evening to you. After nine days, they got it. The 
very basics of a deal in the mideast, that is, enough of an agreement 
to give all sides something to sign, enough of a breakthrough to justify 
an east room event loaded with V.I. pifments and speeches, praising 
the spirit of cooperation. It wasn't easy. It's being called land 
for peace. And while it seemed dead for a time, it's very much alive, 
or so it seems tonight. The peace part of it gave Mr. Clinton a chance 
to look presidential. It gave Arafat most of what he wanted. Netanyahu 
provided the drama of the day. It was the ailing king of Jordan who 
provided sates man ship. We begin with Claire Shipman. The participants 
were clearly weary, but the sense of relief and celebration was palpable. 
This is an important moment to give a secure and peaceful future for 
our children and if children of your neighbors, the Palestinians. 
We will never go back. We will never leave -- we will never go back 
to violence and confrontation. And Bill Clinton, who spent more than 
80 hours in negotiations at the wye plantation clearly savored the 
praise and personal triumph. People around the world should be heartened 
by this achievement today. The agreement at the core trades land for 
peace. Israel with withdraw from 13% of the West Bank in exchange 
for extensive security guarantees from the Palestinians. Adding moral 
weight and considerable pressure was Jordan's king Hussein, who was 
in the United States undergoing chemotherapy for him Foe MA. There 
has been enough destruction, enough death. If it was a test of an 
embattled president president's clout, his aides are eck stat tick. 
He took to the talks with an unusual intensity, understanding his 
role not only as peacemaker but his role in creating his own legacy.
