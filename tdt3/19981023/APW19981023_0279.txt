Officials from the University of El Salvador have criticized the awarding 
of the Nobel Prize in Medicine to three Americans, saying a Salvadoran 
made the discoveries that led to the award. Not giving the Nobel prize 
to Salvador Moncada ``puts in doubt its credibility,'' Eduardo Espinoza, 
dean of the university's medical faculty, said Thursday. In Stockholm, 
Sweden, Agneta Sjoevall, a spokeswoman for the Nobel Committee of 
the Karolinska Institute, declined comment on the Moncada dispute, 
saying the committee as a matter of principle does not comment on 
complaints about whom it chooses for the prize. This is standard procedure 
for all the Nobel-awarding bodies. The prize was awarded this month 
to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Dr. Ferid Murad for discovering 
that the body uses nitric oxide gas to make blood vessels relax and 
widen _ a finding that helped lead to the anti-impotency drug Viagra 
and could also result in treatments for heart disease. Salvadoran 
university officials said Moncada made the discovery six months before 
the U.S. researchers did. In a telephone interview from London, where 
he is a professor at University College, Moncada said he was pleased 
that scientists in his field were awarded the Nobel. He said Fuchgott 
``deserved the honor fully'' and praised the other two winners as 
``very significant researchers.'' He said the prize was not a top 
priority for him and that it was more important to have made contributions 
to the nitric oxide research and to be recognized by his peers. ``Certainly 
a Nobel prize for a Latin American investigator is important for Latin 
America. But I feel very relaxed in terms of my own contribution, 
which has been fundamental,'' he said. Dr. Jonathan Stamler of the 
Duke University Medical Center and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute 
said Moncada and the three prize winners all made major contributions 
to the field. Which ones deserve the prize ``depends on the criteria 
being judged,'' he said.
