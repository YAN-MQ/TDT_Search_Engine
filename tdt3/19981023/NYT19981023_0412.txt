No one yet knows how much digital mayhem the world will face when 
the year 2000 arrives. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
suggest that repair and contingency planning projects are just now 
building up steam at many companies. That might lead to the assumption 
that companies helping corporate America battle the so-called millennium 
bug have a rosy earnings outlook. But the Bloomberg Year 2000 index 
of 34 stocks in this field has lost 34.6 percent this year, compared 
with a gain of 11.7 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. A second 
year-2000 index, designed by Peter de Jager, a well-known year-2000 
consultant, is down 8.8 percent this year even though it defines the 
year-2000 universe more broadly than Bloomberg does. What's going 
on? Let's start by recalling the story line that once thrilled investors 
in these stocks: Big problems will arise from the fact that many computers 
use just two digits to represent years, and do not recognize ``00'' 
as 2000. Some machines read ``00'' as 1900; others are flat-out mystified. 
Analysts have projected that as much as $600 billion will be spent 
to solve the problems. Investors started searching for year-2000 beneficiaries 
in the mid-1990s, even before most companies started working on the 
problem. Established software and computer companies responded by 
developing and spotlighting their year-2000 wares. Some, like Viasoft 
Inc. and the Computer Horizons Corp., used the rising interest as 
a springboard for going public. The Zitel Corp., a specialist in computer 
memory devices, bought an interest in a small year-2000 code repair 
company, the Matridigm Corp., in 1995; Zitel's stock, which had been 
languishing at about $5, surged to more than $60 by late 1996. As 
a group, year-2000 stocks outperformed the market by a wide margin 
in 1996 and 1997. Even including the underperformance this year, the 
Bloomberg index is still up 34.9 percent, annualized, since the beginning 
of 1996, compared with just 21.4 percent for the S&AMP;P 500. And 
the de Jager index is up 35.8 percent, annualized. The time is long 
past, though, for the strategy that Damian Rinaldi, who follows the 
sector for the First Albany Corp., described as ``buy a basket and 
empty it as the leaders emerge.'' Over the past year, more and more 
investors have begun treating many year-2000 companies as yesterday's 
investment fad. ``During 1997, anything associated with the year 2000 
got a premium,'' said Stan Corker, director of technology research 
at Emerald Research, a Lancaster, Pa., firm whose clients include 
institutions and mutual funds. ``Now, investors are more concerned 
with whether these companies will fall off a cliff on Jan. 1, 2000.'' 
These days, there can be steep price declines at almost any sign of 
earnings or revenue shortfalls. Viasoft is trading at $4.9375, down 
from its 52-week high of $44 last October. Peritus Software Services, 
a company that, like Viasoft, automates the search for year-2000 problems, 
plummeted late last year and now trades at $1.09375, down from a high 
of $29.125 last October. Data Dimensions, which hit its 52-week high 
of $35.50 a year ago, now trades at $15.125. And Zitel closed at $3.34375 
on Friday. These and other hard-hit companies are all associated with 
the first stages of year-2000 projects: assessing where the problems 
lie and repairing the right computer code. Although revenues and earnings 
grew rapidly at first, they appear to have peaked sooner _ and at 
lower levels _ than Wall Street had expected. Much corporate spending 
seems to be going not toward repairs but toward avoiding the problem 
by buying new computers and software. One bright spot has been companies 
like Compuware that have emphasized not just their repair capabilities 
but also so-called later-stage tools like software for testing completed 
repairs. Stocks of companies like Keane Inc., with broader information 
management skills, fared better than the Viasofts of the year-2000 
universe, but have also weakened. Keane, for example, has probably 
seen its year-2000 business peak at $102 million, or 37 percent of 
revenues, in its most recent quarter, according to Richard Park, a 
securities analyst at Merrill Lynch. Now investors may be wondering 
how quickly its year-2000 work will tail off and how rapidly it can 
win new outsourcing contracts and other business from big corporate 
computer users. Keane's shares are at $31.75, down from their peak 
of $60.9375 on July 8. ``The issue for everyone is whether year 2000 
is a long-term source of leverage with clients or whether it will 
disappear without a trace,'' said Rinaldi of First Albany. He and 
many others say that year-2000 stocks will remain volatile but that 
investors have become too gloomy about many of them. He maintains 
a buy on Keane, and strong buys on Compuware, Mercury Interactive 
and Cognicase. ``Y2K has been a catalyst for growth for all of them 
but it's not dominant,'' Rinaldi said. For its part, Emerald Research 
maintains buys on Keane and the Mastech Corp., a leader in outsourcing 
remediation work to programmers in India. Also seeing possibilities 
in the sector is Thomas Dorsey, president of Dorsey Wright and Associates, 
a Richmond firm that specializes in technical analysis. ``The de Jager 
index can spring back just as fast as it fell,'' Dorsey said, and 
he recommends that investors buy call options on it. Major index components 
that have minor year-2000 exposure, like Unisys and the EMC Corp., 
are in good shape, he said, and several others, including Keane, are 
``great bottom-fishing plays.''
