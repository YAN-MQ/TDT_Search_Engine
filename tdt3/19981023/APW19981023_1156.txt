Command of the NATO-led force charged with maintaining the peace among 
Bosnia's Serbs, Muslims and Croats changed hands Friday. U.S. Gen. 
Montgomery Meigs took over from U.S. Gen. Eric Shinseki as head of 
the force guarding the peace laid out in the 1995 Dayton accords. 
In the 15 months under Shinseki, the troops successfully oversaw three 
elections and arrested several war-criminals. Some 36,000 troops from 
40 countries and stationed across the country make up the NATO-led 
force. Deputy NATO Secretary General Sergio Balanzino flew in from 
NATO headquarters in Brussels to attend Friday's handover ceremonies 
in Sarajevo and present Shinseki with a medal for his services. Balanzino 
was standing in for NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, who was 
called away to a meeting in Brussels. Shinseki knows his successor 
since they fought together in Vietnam. It was Meigs who found himself 
at outgoing general's bedside after his second injury back then to 
donate blood, Shinseki said. ``Monty, God bless and best wishes for 
a great ride,'' he told his successor, as he handed over the flag. 
Before departing Shinseki thanked everyone _ foreigners and Bosnians 
alike _ who helped make his mission a success. Those who oppose Dayton 
will not last long and continuing the war by other means will not 
work, Shinseki said. ``Mark my words ... the rule of law is coming,'' 
he said. ``Each successful election will change the face of government 
here forever.''
