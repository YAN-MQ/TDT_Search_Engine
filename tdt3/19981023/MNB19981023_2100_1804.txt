now that this mideast peace agreement has been signed after nine days 
of negotiations, pretty much around the clock, comes an even tougher 
job for the participants, prime minister Netanyahu and Arafat must 
convince the people back home this is a good deal. NBC news correspondent 
Martin Fletcher reports. After 17 months of stalemate, nine days of 
intense bargaining, all eyes here were on the TV set. Success at last. 
Or was it? Palestinians. This man asks, thgs what we've been fighting 
for for so many years? This is not a fair peace. This man agrees and 
adds, what can Yasser Arafat do? He has to accept. America is biased 
and gets whatever it wants. Not far from the Palestinians, an Israeli 
just as cautious. Everyone's worried that religious extremists on 
both sides, Jews and Arabs, could kill the peace process through acts 
of terrorism. He said, ""it's good this took a long time. We have 
to be careful. The problem will be making the agreement work." The 
biggest problem among the people, Arabs and Jews, is simply trust. 
They don't trust Israel, but they all agreed there has been too much 
blood. They want peace badly. Enough blood. It looks good, and it 
sounds good on TV, but so far, each successful stage in the peace 
process has led directly to a new crisis. It's too early to celebrate, 
but this is a vital step forward along the road to peace. Martin Fletcher, 
Tel Aviv.
