Iraq is yet to receive ``a single spare part'' for its ailing oil 
industry even though the U.N. allocated dlrs 300 million for the purchases 
four months ago, the oil ministry said in a statement published Friday. 
A ministry spokesman accused the United States of blocking approval 
at the United Nations for many contracts that Iraq signed with international 
companies to purchase the spare parts. The statement, issued Thursday, 
was published in government newspapers, al-Iraq and al-Thawra. The 
United States is a member of the U.N. sanctions committee, which must 
approve every deal that Iraq signs for importing goods. The system 
is aimed at preventing Iraq from buying material that can be used 
to make weapons of mass destruction. ``Iraq has not received a single 
spare part till now because of the hampering of the American representative 
in the 661 (sanctions) committee,'' said the statement. The committee 
itself makes no ``efforts to speed up the approvals for the contracts 
related to the oil industry,'' it said. The accusation echoes similar 
Iraqi complaints in the past that the United States and Britain deliberately 
hold up contracts for most items, a charge the two countries deny. 
Iraq was banned from selling oil freely under U.N. sanctions imposed 
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But acknowledging the hardships 
caused by the loss of revenue, the United Nations allowed Iraq to 
sell limited quantities of oil to buy food, medicines and other humanitarian 
goods since December 1996. In July, the U.N. also agreed to let Iraq 
use dlrs 300 million of its oil revenue to buy spare parts for its 
oil industry that has fallen into disrepair. The ministry statement 
said that until Oct. 19 Iraq had submitted 197 contracts to the sanctions 
committee out of the 450 contracts signed with companies for supplying 
spare parts. ``Only 55 contracts were approved while the American 
representative put on hold 61 contracts under baseless reasons with 
the intention of delaying the arrival of the spare parts,'' said the 
statement. Iraq will continue to remain under sanctions until the 
United Nations is satisfied that it has dismantled its weapons of 
mass destruction.
