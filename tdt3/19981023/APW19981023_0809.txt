Command of the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia changed hands Friday, 
with U.S. Gen. Montgomery Meigs taking over from U.S. Gen. Eric Shinseki. 
For three years, the force has been ensuring that Bosnia's Serbs, 
Muslims and Croats maintain the peace they agreed to in the 1995 Dayton 
accords. Some 36,000 troops from 40 countries and stationed across 
the country make up the NATO-led force. In the 15 months under Shinseki, 
the troops successfully oversaw three elections and arrested several 
war-criminals. Deputy NATO Secretary General Sergio Balanzino flew 
in from NATO headquarters in Brussels to attend handover ceremonies 
in Sarajevo and present Shinseki with a medal for his services. Balanzino 
was standing in for NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who was 
called away to an important meeting in Brussels. A meeting with the 
newly elected tripartite Bosnian presidency was canceled due to bad 
weather, which delayed Balanzino's arrival, but the secretary general 
told journlaists after the ceremony he had a message for leaders: 
``Comply with Dayton. Don't allow disruption and disorder in your 
country which is now rebuilding itself.'' Shinseki knows his successor 
since they fought together in Vietnam. It was Meigs who found himself 
at outgoing general's bedside after his second injury back then to 
donate blood, Shinseki said. ``Monty, God bless and best wishes for 
a great ride,'' he told his successor, as he handed over the flag. 
Before departing Shinseki thanked everyone _ foreigners and Bosnians 
alike _ who helped make his mission a success. ``Forty nations, indeed, 
the entire World has come to Bosnia-Herzegovina at your invitation 
to give you the opportunity to put the war behind you,'' he told local 
politicians. Those who oppose Dayton will not last long and continuing 
the war by other means will not work, Shinseki said. ``Mark my words, 
... the rule of law is coming,'' he said. ``Each successful election 
will change the face of government here forever.''
