The Bulgarian parliament agreed Friday to allow NATO planes to use 
Bulgarian airspace if the alliance launches airstrikes against neighboring 
Yugoslavia. The decision passed parliament by a vote of 150 for and 
47 _ mostly from the opposition Socialist party _ against. Nine lawmakers 
abstained. Earlier this month, NATO's North Atlantic Council had asked 
Bulgaria to allow unlimited access to its airspace for possible military 
operations over Yugoslavia. The declaration passed Friday stresses 
Bulgaria's will for a peaceful solution to the conflict and states 
that the country won't participate directly or indirectly in military 
actions in Yugoslavia.
