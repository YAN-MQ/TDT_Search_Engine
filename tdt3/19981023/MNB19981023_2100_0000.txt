We have no right to dictate through irresponsible action or narrow-mindedness 
future of our children and chair children's children. An emotional 
ending after nine days, right to the edge and back. A deal among the 
big players in the mideast. Victory in the east room. Will it hold 
in the West Bank? The man in jail who almost killed this deal. What 
does this spy still know that still makes him somehow dangerous? The 
hero gets a second shot. Our conversation with the astronaut-turned-senator-turned- 
astronaut again, john Glenn. A family gets a pass to leave cube ba 
to visit New York to visit their son, brother, and father, El duque, 
the people a Yankee pitcher left behind at home come to him in New 
York.
