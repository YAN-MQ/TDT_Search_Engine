A computer-controlled smart needle that can detect cancerous breast 
lumps is being developed by a team of researchers at Sanford University 
in NASA. When inserted into the breasts, the needle will be able to 
tell the difference between normal fatty tissue and tumors. Thanks 
to highly evolved computer software that allows the device to learn 
by experience. Doctors would use ultrasound imaging to guide the needle 
probe into a suspect lump, which the probe would then determine to 
be either malignant or benign. What's more, the device would actually 
be able to suggest proper individualized treatment. NASA researcher 
Robert Ma, co-developer of the probe, says it could help determine 
the distinctive features of a malignancy and how the disease might 
progress. If laboratory tests of the probe are successful, Dr. Ma 
and his colleague Stephanie Jeffrey of Stanford Medical School planned 
to begin human tests early next year. Researchers say similar technology 
could be used in diagnostic instruments for other cancers, including 
those of the prostate and colon.
