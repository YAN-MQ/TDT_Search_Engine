A federal judge has dealt a serious blow to Orange County's chances 
of recovering further damages from Wall Street securities firms in 
connection with the county's 1994 bankruptcy. In a ruling issued late 
Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Gary Taylor rejected the main 
legal argument the Southern California county has been using in its 
lawsuits against more than a dozen securities firms. ``It basically 
means their primary case against the rest of the Street is going to 
be eliminated,'' said George Simon, a lawyer with Foley &AMP; Lardner 
in Chicago. He represented Fuji Securities, which was being sued by 
Orange County in the case before Taylor. J. Michael Hennigan, a lawyer 
representing Orange County, agreed that the theory rejected by Taylor 
represented ``the heart of the case against the brokers.'' He said 
the county planned to appeal. The county has been arguing that its 
former treasurer, Robert Citron, was not authorized by state laws 
and the state constitution to enter into some of the risky transactions 
he undertook that eventually led to the county's bankruptcy. Therefore, 
the county argued, the transactions, known as reverse repurchase agreements, 
should be void and the county compensated by the brokers. But Taylor, 
in a 36-page ruling, concluded that ``although they may have been 
unwise, speculative, or unduly risky'' the transactions were not unauthorized 
and not void. ``There was authority to act,'' he said. Orange County, 
which lost more than $1.6 billion in the bankruptcy, has recovered 
$739 million in settlements, including $400 million from Merrill Lynch 
&AMP; Co., the Wall Street firm that served as its financial adviser 
and as underwriter of $875 million of Orange County bonds. Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter settled for $69.6 million, Nomura Securities for 
$47.9 million and Credit Suisse First Boston for $52.5 million. The 
county also reached settlements with a law firm and its accounting 
firm. Those existing settlements will not be affected by Thursday's 
ruling, Hennigan said. He also said the county had reached, but not 
yet announced, settlements with three other parties, two of them securities 
firms. One is Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., which agreed to pay $6 million 
$7 million. He would not identify the other two parties. The ruling 
seems to raise questions about whether the firms that did settle should 
have done so. But lawyers familiar with the litigation say some of 
the companies, particularly Merrill Lynch, were sued on other grounds 
as well as the one rejected by Taylor. Lawyers say that Thursday's 
ruling will make it harder for the county to reach lucrative settlements 
with the roughly dozen other brokerage firms it has sued. Still, the 
county does have other arguments it can use against some of these 
brokers. The county has also sued Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp., the 
credit rating agency that is a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos.; Rauscher 
Pierce Refsnes, a bond underwriter, and Brown &AMP; Wood, a law firm. 
Taylor's ruling is expected to have little bearing on these cases. 
Fuji Securities, a New York-based unit of Japan's Fuji Bank, played 
a relatively minor role in Orange County and decided not to settle 
because it thought it did no wrong, Simon, the company's lawyer said. 
``All Fuji ever did was respond to bids from the county,'' he said. 
In the reverse repurchase agreements, the county sold securities to 
brokers and agreed to buy them back in the future, usually in less 
than 180 days. It then invested the proceeds from the sale in riskier 
but higher-yielding securities, hoping to make a profit even after 
subtracting the costs of the reverse repurchase agreement.
