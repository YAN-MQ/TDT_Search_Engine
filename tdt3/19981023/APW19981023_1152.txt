The crowd roared, confetti poured and the World Series Champion New 
York Yankees _ including ailing teammate Darryl Strawberry _ made 
their way up Manhattan's Canyon of Heroes. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
and Yankees manager Joe Torre were on the lead float, but the crowd 
reserved its biggest cheers Friday for Strawberry, who is recovering 
from colon cancer surgery and missed the Series' four-game sweep of 
the San Diego Padres. Chants of ``Darryl! Darryl!'' echoed in the 
skyscraper-lined canyon, as fans with blue and white painted faces, 
waving signs reveled in a blizzard of shredded paper as Strawberry 
rode past them in a red classic Cadillac. The entire day was emotional 
for pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, who smiled and waved from 
the Yankees pitchers' float. Hours earlier, Hernandez was reunited 
with his mother, two daughters and ex-wife when they arrived from 
Cuba at about 3 a.m. It was the first time he had seen them since 
he defected from Cuba in December on a raft. The Cuban government 
granted the family a temporary visa so they could attend the parade. 
No crowd estimate was immediately available but hundreds of thousands 
stood 10 to 40 deep along the mile-long (1.6-kilometer) parade route 
from Battery City Park to City Hall. ``Jeter! Jeter!'' teen-aged girls 
squealed, waving signs proposing marriage as Yankee heartthrob Derek 
Jeter passed by. Pitcher David Wells and catcher Jorge Posada obviously 
wanted to preserve the memory by videotaping the crowd as the crowd 
filmed them. Brooms of all sizes and shapes _ kitchen brooms, garage 
brooms, whisk brooms _ were in evidence, signifying the Yankees four-game 
sweep of the San Diego Padres in the World Series. At City Hall, where 
the mayor presented the players the keys to the city, trees were draped 
in paper streamers and confetti and the stage adorned in a rainbow 
of red, white and blue balloons. The record-breaking 1998 Yankees 
won 125 games this season, including the playoffs and World Series, 
more than any other team in U.S. Major League Baseball history. It 
was the team's 24th World Series win _ also a record. The celebration 
_ the second parade for the Yankees in three years _ began at Battery 
Park shortly before noon. The march included 13 marching bands; 10 
classic cars; eight Yankee floats; seven double-decker buses, six 
press trucks _ and the Radio City Rockettes on a flatbed truck. The 
floats carried the team, coaches and support crews while the Yankee 
wives, children and politicians rode in double-decker buses. World 
Series Most Valuable Player Scott Brosius had his own float.
