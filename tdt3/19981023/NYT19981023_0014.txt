Saying that the prestige of the state attorney general's office had 
declined under Dennis Vacco, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., 
Thursday endorsed the Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, saying 
he would bring energy and high legal standards to the job. Moynihan 
said that previous attorneys general going back to Jacob Javits, a 
Republican, had run the office in a nonpartisan manner and had hired 
first-rate lawyers. Under Vacco, however, ``the office has declined,'' 
the senator said, standing with Spitzer on the steps of the main branch 
of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. ``It has low visibility, 
which is probably just as well if you knew what was going on,'' he 
added. A spokesman for Vacco belittled the endorsement as a predictable 
partisan gesture. ``Dennis Vacco has been endorsed by every law enforcement 
group in the state for his leadership in the fight against crime,'' 
said the spokesman, Michael Zabel, ``while Eliot Spitzer can only 
get support from Democratic politicians who are obligated to endorse 
him by party loyalty.'' Moynihan, however, has often been chided by 
his party for failing to lend a hand to Democrats in New York state 
races. Earlier this month, he bestowed a rare endorsement on Rep. 
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., in his race against Republican Sen. Alfonse 
D'Amato. Vacco had only one campaign stop on his schedule Thursday, 
an evening appearance on Long Island to be named honorary law enforcement 
man of the year by the Nassau County Police Department Detectives 
Association. That organization is one of about four dozen law enforcement 
groups to endorse the Republican incumbent. In his prepared remarks, 
Vacco made no mention of his challenger, choosing to concentrate on 
his own accomplishments during four years in office: a crackdown on 
child pornography on the Internet, presiding over the state's first 
death-penalty-eligible case since capital punishment was restored 
in New York, and a series of drug arrests. Vacco and Spitzer are scheduled 
to face each other Friday night in their first debate, on News 12 
Long Island in Woodbury, N.Y. The taped debate will be shown on the 
Woodbury television stations and on two other News 12 stations in 
Westchester County and in the Bronx. The two candidates are to meet 
in a second debate on Sunday _ live on WABC-TV, Channel 7 _ that will 
be shown statewide on some ABC affiliates. In a campaign in which 
both sides have struggled to gain public and news media attention, 
Spitzer clearly hoped that Moynihan's endorsement would gain him both 
votes and publicity. Moynihan said he became involved in the campaign 
because the attorney general's office had undergone so much change. 
``This is an important race,'' the senator said. ``This has to do 
with the quality of government in New York.'' He said Spitzer would 
follow the example of Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, 
hiring people with strong academic credentials and experience rather 
than political connections. Spitzer worked under Morgenthau as an 
assistant district attorney and ran that office's labor racketeering 
unit in 1991 and 1992. Moynihan shied away from specifically criticizing 
Vacco's performance, other than to say that the office was not what 
it used to be. But he said he felt confident that Spitzer would use 
the power of the attorney general's office to take action against 
General Electric Co. for failing to remove PCB contaminants from the 
Hudson River. GE, which operated two factories that legally released 
more than a billion pounds of PCBs into the river before such discharges 
were banned in 1977, has long contended that the contaminated areas 
are mostly dormant. ``In 1978, I got a $15 million appropriation to 
scoop up the PCBs that General Electric has dumped in the Hudson River,'' 
Moynihan said. ``The $15 million has long since disappeared; the PCBs 
are still there. That's government not working. People drink that 
water, up and down the Hudson. No attorney general has done anything 
about it.'' Pointing to Spitzer, Moynihan added: ``He will. He knows 
it's there. How he will do it, I don't know. He does.''
