ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Thousands of Muslim faithful flocked to 
the Pakistani capital on Friday in what organizers called the start 
of an Islamic revolution to sweep from power a government dogged by 
corruption scandals and a shattered economy. ``This is the beginning,'' 
said Liaquat Baluch, a leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, the right wing religious 
party organizing the three-day rally that ends on Sunday. ``The message 
is that we will go in to the streets, to the villages, the countryside, 
the remote areas of the country and awaken the people, '' he said 
and bring a new Islamic order to Pakistan. Jamaat's show of strength 
is an impressive one with hundreds of brightly colored tents encasing 
the tree-lined boulevards of the capital. Green Jamaat-e-Islami flags 
emblazoned cars and buses and giant banners urging the faithful to 
fight for their religion were strung across the streets. Throughout 
the day, scores of buses streamed into the capital crammed with people, 
many of them hanging from the windows and crowded onto the roof. Hundreds 
of young boys with headbands with the inscription 'God is Great' patrolled 
waving bamboo sticks to keep order among the crowd. As the call to 
prayer sounded men-- their heads wrapped in turbans or checkered scarves 
-- knelt in prayer at Faisl Mosque, a white marble mosque, whose four 
giant minarets dominate the skyline of Islamabad. Women climbed to 
the second floor where they laid mats on the marble floor and prayed. 
``We need an Islamic revolution in Pakistan. . . that is the only 
way,'' said Mohammed Uzari, stroking his wispy black beard. ``But 
it will be peaceful. The government will go.'' Behind him in the crowd 
some young men yelled: ``if the government doesn't go peacefully we 
will force them to go.'' The last time Jamaat-e-Islami tried to hold 
its rally in the capital, the government then led by Benazir Bhutto, 
resisted. She deployed hundreds of police and ordered them to stop 
demonstrators at the city limits. Three people were killed. This time 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government lent a helping hand, deploying 
hundreds of traffic police and cooperating with Jamaat-e-Islami organizers. 
``They should see how we cooperated and hold a peaceful rally,'' said 
Sheikh Rashid, a member of Sharif's Cabinet. ``We don't want any trouble.'' 
Despite Sharif's attempts to pass a bill that would impose Islamic 
law in Pakistan, Jamaat-e-Islami organizers say the prime minister 
is not an ally. ``They are not sincere,'' and because they are tarnished 
by charges of corruption, ``they are not able to impose Shariat,'' 
said Baluch, referring to law based on the Koran. Rashid said the 
government is aware of the increasingly powerful religious lobby in 
Pakistan, and many people believe a desire to tap into this is behind 
Sharif's drive to amend the constitution. In a telephone interview, 
Rashid says the rise in the right wing religious lobby to the collapsing 
economy, the fault, he says, of international sanctions imposed after 
Pakistan replied to neighboring India's nuclear tests with underground 
tests of its own. ``Economic sanctions have caused restrictions and 
people are turning to religion . . . it doesn't have anything to do 
with Islam, but it is a reaction to the poverty,'' said Rashid.
