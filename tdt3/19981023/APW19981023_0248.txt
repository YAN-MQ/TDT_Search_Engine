Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced the 1999 budget Friday with 
stimulus measures he hoped would eke out a 1 percent growth rate to 
bring the country out of recession next year. The optimistic goal 
comes in the wake of an estimated 4.8 percent contraction in the economy 
this year, provoking the first formal recession in more than a decade. 
The Southeast Asian country expects a budget deficit of 6 percent 
next year. Officials said they were confident the deficit could be 
financed through domestic sources. Mahathir reiterated his attack 
against foreign currency speculators and Western financial experts, 
blaming their greed and policies for much of the Asian economic crisis. 
``The interests of developing countries like Malaysia are not important 
to them,'' he told members of Parliament. ``As such, we cannot depend 
on their assistance _ our destiny is in our own hands.'' Mahathir, 
also first finance minister following his sacking of Anwar Ibrahim 
last month, announced a number of tax measures designed to revive 
the flagging economy by helping some sectors and penalizing others. 
International trading companies, for example, would be given a 70 
percent tax exemption in 1999. Income from domestic tour packages 
involving at least 1,200 tourists annually would be exempt from income 
tax. Electronic goods companies will see an end to excise duties on 
certain products. But levies on cigarettes, alcohol and gambling will 
go up. Mahathir noted the budget would formalize stimulus measures 
implemented in the National Economic Recovery Plan announced in August. 
``This plan aims at freeing Malaysia from the grip of the Asian financial 
crisis and to place Malaysia's economy on a stronger footing,'' he 
said. The Finance Ministry said prospects for 1999 depend on the speed 
of fiscal stimulus and looser monetary policy. This includes 12 billion 
ringgit (dlrs 3.2 billion) in two stimulus packages announced in August, 
as well as the introduction of two new agencies to takeover the management 
of bad debts and help recapitalize the banking sector. Meanwhile, 
thousands of anti-government demonstrators were prevented from marching 
on Parliament as Mahathir presented the budget to lawmakers. They 
were protesting the jailing of Anwar, who faces charges of corruption 
and illegal homosexual activities. Mahathir was unhappy with Anwar's 
recent performance as finance minister _ the ousted minister preferred 
higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy _ but insists he 
did not sack him over policy differences. This year's budget follows 
Mahathir's philosophy of spending more to boost corporate health, 
spur recovery and create employment. Government spending has been 
raised by nearly 20 percent in 1998, after Malaysia turned its back 
on International Monetary Fund-style, tight-money, low-spending policies. 
Next year's budget stands at 65.10 billion ringgit (dlrs 17.1 billion), 
with an overall deficit of 16.14 billion (dlrs 4.1 billion), which 
will be financed by government assets and borrowing.
