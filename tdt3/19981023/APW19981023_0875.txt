President Carlos Menem said Friday he offered no Britain apologies 
for the Falklands war, but looked forward to a historic trip to heal 
wounds over their 1982 conflict. Ahead of the first visit by an Argentine 
president to Britain since the war, Menem called his trip ``a re-encounter 
and an exploration'' during which he would express a ``will to normalize 
relations definitively.'' But he insisted he never told Britain he 
was sorry for the conflict in the South Atlantic, even though he lamented 
the hundreds of deaths in the war for the Falklands, which Argentina 
calls the Malvinas. ``At no moment did I offer apologies,'' Menem 
told reporters Friday, hours after Britain's largest-selling tabloid, 
The Sun, ran a front-page headline stating, ``Argentine: We are Sorry 
for the Falklands.'' The Sun quoted a letter from Menem as saying 
``Some brave young Argentine and British soldiers lost their lives 
in a conflict that should never have happened and that we deeply regret.'' 
Asked about his choice of words, Menem told reporters: ``We are simply 
making a reference to a lamentable situation ... many deaths and blood 
that was shed.'' The war for the islands _ which are populated by 
some 2,200 people of mostly British ancestry _ claimed at least 970 
lives, including 255 British forces. But Menem wrote in the Argentine 
newspaper Clarin on Friday that his country has not renounced claim 
to the islands. Argentine argues it inherited the islands from the 
Spanish crown before their 1833 occupation by the British. Under the 
headline, ``Why we are going to London,'' Menem declared in Clarin: 
``The Malvinas are Argentine without a doubt'' and he would continue 
to press for ``our unalienable rights'' to the islands. Nonetheless, 
Argentine officials have acknowledged that the dispute was not likely 
to be central to the five-day trip. ``Unfortunately the British have 
shown themselves to be intransigent when it comes to discussions with 
Argentine on the issue of sovereignty,'' Argentine Foreign Minister 
Guido Di Tella said. Menem's state visit will be rich in symbolism, 
highlighted by a wreath-laying at Britain's Falkland war memorial 
and a reconciliation service at Saint Paul's Cathedral. But beyond 
the symbols, Menem has said he wants both countries to profit from 
``strong and vigorous'' relations in trade, which reached a record 
dlrs 1.2 billion in 1997. Despite moves by both sides to focus on 
other issues, the mission has revived Argentines' memories of the 
war. Newspapers here have heavily covered preparations. Opposition 
lawmakers have criticized the trip for apparently leaving little room 
for real talk on the islands' sovereignty. Hundreds of Argentine war 
veterans used the upcoming visit to demand greater recognition and 
compensation, noisily protesting outside congress. In London, Prime 
Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said Thursday that Menem's visit will 
not be overshadowed by either the Falklands or the arrest of Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator who is under armed guard 
at a London clinic. British police arrested the 82-year-old general 
on Oct. 16 on a warrant from Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite 
him on charges relating to the murder, genocide and torture of victims 
killed during his 17-year rule.
