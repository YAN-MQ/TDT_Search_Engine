This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather" 
forecast for Saturday. We look for quiet weather across much of the 
country. It will warm up in the eastern United States. Look for a 
few showers along the east coast of Florida and scattered through 
the plain states and we'll see big rains along the west coast as a 
Cold front pushes into the region. Highs on Saturday over much of 
the northwest will be just in the 50s. We'll see some 50s in northern 
New England and the northern Great Lakes. But most of the rest of 
the country we'll see 60s and 70s with a few 80s in the desert southwest, 
south Texas and southern Florida. Looking ahead to Sunday, it will 
be wet and windy through the southwestern part of the country. On 
Monday, scattered showers through that region with thunderstorms developing 
in south Texas. And on Tuesday, look for scattered showers from the 
southwest into south texas and rain showers in the northwest with 
the coolest air in the northeast just 40s and 50s.
