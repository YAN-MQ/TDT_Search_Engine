Imagine what your life would be like if you couldn't drink water. 
That's the subject in "thirst," one of the movies this weekend on 
TV. Sherri Sylvester reports. "Ellen's" Joely Fisher teams up with 
"Chicago hope's" Adam Arkin in the world premiere of "thirst" -- a 
more apt title "water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink." We 
were trying desperately not to make like the typical victim-of-the-week 
movie of the week. But just when you thought it was safe to go back 
into the you-know-what, a killer virus attacks. Susan, no water, that 
means pools, showers, hand/face washing, nothing, bad. Well, how bad 
is it? It's bad. And it gets worse -- add riots, a heat wave and fires 
to the deadly concoction. You die of thirst? Exactly. We've heard 
these stories about these people that, you know, that have died from 
you know, the simplest most important basic need in our life, which 
is water. Those who find the story of "thirst" easy to swallow can 
check it out on NBC.
