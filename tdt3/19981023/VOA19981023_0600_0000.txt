All sides in the Mideast peace talks say they are close to an agreement 
on a new land-for-peace deal, as the summit talks near Washington 
enter their ninth day. Technical experts meet at the United Nations 
to discuss a report that the Iraqi government may have placed nerve 
gas on weapons before the Gulf War began. The government of Japan 
is nationalizing a major bank and it may be the first of 11. As many 
as 120,000 people in Southern Sudan face a humanitarian disaster because 
of an unusually devastating period of wet weather on top of a widespread 
famine. I'm Imani Crosby. And I'm Elizabeth Arat. Those stores and 
more, all ahead in this hour of VOA News Now. First, the news.
