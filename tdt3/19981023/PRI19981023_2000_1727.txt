You're listening to THE WORLD now but you can click on us anytime 
online at www.theworld.org. This is PRI. The Arden Theater Company 
presents the emotionally charged stage adaptation of John Steinbeck's 
classic American novel, "The Grapes of Wrath" featuring a cast of 
25 actors and musicians live on stage. The Arden's production of "The 
Grapes of Wrath" puts the audience in the middle of the action and 
in the center of the Jode family saga with vibrant music and old-fashioned 
storytelling. The Arden Theater's number is 215-922-8900. The Arden 
Theater joins you in support of 91 FM. I'm Tony Kahn. Still ahead 
on THE WORLD, Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, plays an expert waiting 
game hoping to wear out the United Nations. And we meet a group of 
modern-day abolitionists. The Romans had slaves. The Greeks had slaves. 
The Incas had slaves. So slavery's always been with us, and it still 
with us, I'm afraid. First, this news.
