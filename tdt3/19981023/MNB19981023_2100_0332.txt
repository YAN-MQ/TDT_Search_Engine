And when we come back here this Friday evening, a closer look at the 
man whose case came close to being a deal breaker. We'll hear from 
Jonathan pollard's father and from the prosecutor who put pollard 
behind bars. Mud holes. Dirt roads. Most people wouldn't think of 
driving through stuff like that. But then, that's the beauty of Subaru 
all-wheel drive. It automatically transfers power from the wheel that 
slip to the wheels that grip. Which means it does the thinking for 
you. Sorry mate... guess I wasn't thinkin'. There are certain things... 
your body is going through-- that the chemo is doing to you. I was 
tired. Very, very tired. One time, my grandchildren were all over, 
and they all went out and got ice cream. And they're all lined up 
on the Porch-- all with ice cream. They start from the age of three... 
all the way up to 18 years of age. What a photograph that had to be. 
I did not have the energy... to go upstairs to grab the camera. I 
missed the photograph-- to me, a once in a lifetime opportunity. Go 
out. Live your life. That's what I'm doing now.
