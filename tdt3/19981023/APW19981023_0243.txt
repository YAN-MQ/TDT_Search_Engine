A surprise strike Friday by ground personnel at Marseille-Provence 
airport forced cancellation of all Air France domestic flights, officials 
said. The cancellations include the Marseille-Paris shuttle. Long-haul 
Air France flights were delayed, along with flights by other companies. 
According to Air France-Europe unions, strikers were protesting work 
conditions and worker strength. In the northern city of Lille, a strike 
by public transport workers protesting attacks against personnel moved 
into its third day, blocking all buses and tramways. The number of 
strikes due to attacks on public transport workers has been on the 
rise in France. On Friday, bus drivers in the Bayonne-Biarritz region 
at the tip of southwest France went on a 24-hour strike to protest 
an attack Thursday night on a colleague.
