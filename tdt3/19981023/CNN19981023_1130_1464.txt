Bob Dylan is revisiting the town he immortalized in his song "highway 
61." Fans young and old turned out in Duluth, Minnesota, last night, 
for the folk singer's first major concert in his hometown. The show 
in the 7,700 seat entertainment convention center had sold out in 
hours. Dylan never acknowledged he was home, but he did treat concertgoers 
to a Five-song encore, which wrapped up with the piece "forever young."
