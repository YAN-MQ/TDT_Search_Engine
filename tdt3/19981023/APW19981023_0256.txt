The United States has informed Israel that a Colorado-based doomsday 
cult that may be planning mass suicide could be en route to the Jewish 
state, a U.S. official said Friday. The leader of the group, Monte 
Kim Miller, has said he will die in Jerusalem in December 1999 and 
will reappear three days later. Followers of Miller sold their belongings 
and left their homes in the United States before Oct. 10, the day 
their leader predicted Denver would be wiped out by an earthquake 
marking the beginning of the apocalypse. There have been recent indications 
that some cult members were in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and planned 
to eventually reach Jerusalem. Larry Schwartz, spokesman for the U.S. 
Embassy in Tel Aviv, said U.S. officials have raised the issue with 
Israel's government. ``Because there have been a number of reports 
in the media about this organization, we have discussed this issue 
with our Israeli counterparts through normal channels,'' Schwartz 
said. ``I think it's safe to assume the Israeli authorities are aware 
of this situation,'' Schwartz said. ``We're following reports,'' said 
Akiva Tor, deputy spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry. ``Of course, 
we'd act appropriately.'' Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin 
refused comment when asked about possible preparations to prevent 
cult members from entering Israel. She said it was an intelligence 
matter.
