Hello, everyone and welcome to Science World. I'm Brian Sislack. Chalk 
up another discovery for NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe, this one involving 
Cholisto, one o Jupiter's close-in moons -- an instrument on a spacecraft 
that measures magnetic fields, picked up what might be a salt ocean 
under Cholisto's icy surface. That makes it the second of Jupiter's 
four major satellites now suspected of harboring liquid water beneath 
a frozen top. The other being Uropa. While scientists had long believed 
Uropa might have a hidden ocean. The data about Cholisto is a surprise. 
Galileo Scientist Margaret Kibelson of UCLA says Cholisto was always 
thought to be a rather boring moon. But now the Cinderella of Jobian 
satellites may fit the glass slipper after all. The tip- off to possible 
was on Choliisto was a variation in the moon's magnetic for which 
the best explanation seems to be a sub-surface layer of melted salty 
liquid. Similar signs were detected on Uropa. Now does this mean that 
Cholisto, like Uropa might possibly harbor the ingredients for life? 
Well, sadly, no. While they both appear to have liquid water and pre-biotic 
chemicals, like amino acids from comets and asteroids, Cholisto does 
not seem to have the energy to support life. It's the kind of energy 
that Earth gets from its proximity to the sun and that Uropa gets 
from tidal activity generated by its closeness to Jupiter.
