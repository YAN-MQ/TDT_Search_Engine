Albert Johnson, a film critic and historian who, as program director 
of the San Francisco International Film Festival from 1965 to 1972, 
was celebrated for his pioneering tributes to Hollywood legends, died 
on Oct. 17 in Chicago. He was 73 and lived in Berkeley, Calif. The 
cause was a heart attack, said his sister, Coretta Greaux. He was 
in Chicago to present an award at the Chicago Film Festival, she said. 
Born and reared in Harlem, where his mother danced at the Cotton Club 
and his father practiced medicine, Johnson attended the University 
of California at Berkeley, majoring in English. After graduation, 
he studied at Oxford University, and at the Shakespeare Institute 
in Stratford, England. He began his film writing and criticism career 
as a contributor to the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound magazine, 
and was its U.S. editor for 10 years after his return to California. 
In 1965, Johnson became the program director of the San Francisco 
International Film Festival, where he introduced works by the foreign 
directors Andrzej Wadja, Nicholas Ray, Lina Wertmuller, Bernardo Bertolucci 
and Volker Schlondorff to U.S. audiences. He also initiated what was 
to become standard festival fare in the form of tributes to screen 
luminaries. By 1980, he had become the festival's artistic director, 
but resigned after a season during which, he said, ``commercial interests 
undermined artistic standards.'' Since 1974, Johnson was a member 
of the department of African-American studies at Berkeley, where he 
introduced courses on third-world cinema and ``Images of Minorities 
in the American Cinema.'' But it was his course on the American musical 
film that earned him his reputation as a compelling lecturer. True 
to the lessons learned from his mother, Johnson was a performer, introducing 
his lectures with a song _ and sometimes, a dance _ from the musical 
being discussed. ``It was like magic when he entered a room,'' said 
Edith Kramer, the film curator and director of the university's Pacific 
Film Archives. In addition to his sister, of Sunrise, Fla., he is 
survived by a brother, Jesse Jenkins Jr. of New York.
