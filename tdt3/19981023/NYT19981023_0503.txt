The women's sportswear maker Anne Klein &AMP; Co. is up for sale, 
and despite the fact that the company has been losing money for several 
years, its lucrative product licenses and well-known brand name would 
make it an attractive acquisition, fashion industry analysts and executives 
said Friday. Several industry executives estimated that Anne Klein 
might be worth $50 million to $75 million. Others said that the high 
value of its licensing businesses could lure a suitor willing to pay 
even $100 million or more. ``What they have is a tremendous brand 
name,'' said Bud Konheim, chief executive of Nicole Miller. ``Everybody 
knows about Anne Klein and respects it as a label.'' While ``their 
brand loyalty has slipped over the last few years, they have tremendous 
distribution and a classy product,'' he added. Anne Klein has been 
struggling for several years and is estimated to be losing $15 million 
to $20 million a year from its clothing lines. But its licensing agreements 
are providing income of about $12 million a year and have sales of 
about $300 million, industry executives said. The company receives 
licensing income from a number of products, including handbags, shoes, 
watches and hosiery. ``They have great potential,'' said Eli Tahari, 
chairman of Tahari Ltd., a New York-based bridge sportswear design 
company interested in acquiring the company. ``They have great licensing 
income. That alone makes them a company that has great possibilities.'' 
Anne Klein is owned by Tomio Taki and Frank Mori, who also co-own 
Donna Karan International. Before starting her own company, Ms. Karan 
was the hand-picked successor to the designer Anne Klein, who died 
of breast cancer in 1974. Although company officials declined to comment, 
those believed to have been approached about purchasing the company 
include Tahari and Arthur Levine, who owns Kasper ASL Ltd., a leading 
maker of women's suits. A third company, Los Angeles-based Azteca 
Production International, headed by Hubert Guez, is also interested 
in buying the company, industry executives said. Azteca, a jeans manufacturer, 
is considered a strong candidate because analysts say they believe 
it has a lot of cash. But Kasper makes sense as a good fit, Konheim 
said, adding: ``It is known for suits. Anne Klein gets them into sportswear.'' 
When asked about Anne Klein, Kasper president Gregg Marks said: ``They 
have made a big turnaround, and their product looks wonderful. We're 
a successful company and we're always looking for ways to increase 
shareholder value.'' Anne Klein stunned the industry in April 1996 
when it closed its designer collection and said it had lost $25 million 
since 1989. In recent years, the company has been plagued by problems 
stemming in part from not having a widely recognized and distinctive 
look to its clothing, fashion experts said. The company also has been 
a revolving door for designers, none of which has successfully revived 
the overall line. Now the company has hired two designers, Isaac Franco 
and Ken Kaufman, from rival Emanuel, and has changed the name of its 
core bridge collection from Anne Klein II to just Anne Klein. And 
the fall clothing line and a new advertising campaign featuring well-known 
women politicians, executives and athletes wearing its clothes have 
been well received.
