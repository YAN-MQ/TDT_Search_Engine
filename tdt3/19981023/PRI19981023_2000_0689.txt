Well, the Palestinians and Israelis do still have far to go. Today's 
accord merely sets the stage for the main event, the so-called permanent 
status talks on the most difficult issues dividing the Israelis and 
Palestinians. THE WORLD's Jeb Sharp lays out the agenda. Those who 
have been following the peace process for years such as Judith Kipper 
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington 
say today's deal has to be kept in perspective. It's only a tiny step 
in an interim agreement and a very small interim agreement on a very 
long road to peace. It is not a treaty that the most difficult issues 
by intention were left for the final status negotiations which are 
to begin soon. Everything remains to be done. Palestinian writer Sayid 
Abareesh. This was supposed to be an interim deal, you know, that 
was supposed to be done about a year and a half ago. It wasn't. It 
has been delayed for a year and a half, and the major issues remain 
to be solved yet: Jerusalem, the refugees, the Palestinian state, 
water. So we are really at the very beginning of a process, you know, 
however much they are going to celebrate in Washington. The remaining 
issues are daunting. Jerusalem is perhaps the most intractable. The 
Israelis call the ancient city their eternal indivisible capital. 
The Palestinians say they must have a piece of it. Negotiators must 
also establish permanent borders for Israel, which raises the fundamental 
question of just how much land the Jewish state will ultimately give 
up in exchange for peace. The question of borders will also affect 
the shape and viability of any future Palestinian state. The two sides 
must also work out how to share scare water supplies and how to compensate 
and resettle refugees who have been displaced by years of conflict. 
But despite all these contentious questions, former Israeli negotiator 
Yahir Herschfeld still thinks today's agreement is significant because 
it signals Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's endorsement of the 
1993 Oslo peace accords. It is the end of the in full dialogue with 
the Palestinians on sovereignty. Both Prime Minister Netanyahu and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat must now sell the deal to their constituents, 
paving the way for much more difficult dialogue as the May 4th, 1999 
deadline set out in the Oslo accords approaches. For THE WORLD, I'm 
Jeb Sharp.
