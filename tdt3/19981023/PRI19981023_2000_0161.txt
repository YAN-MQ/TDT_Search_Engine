The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the merger 
of Northwest and Continental Airlines. NPR's Steve Innskeep has more. 
The government says the deal would reduce competition and raise fares 
for millions of travelers. Together, the two airlines would enjoy 
a near monopoly on traffic between some of their hub cities like Memphis, 
Detroit, and Cleveland. But even as they sued, Justice Department 
lawyers did not take another step that would actually prevent the 
merger. The government did not ask a judge for a temporary restraining 
order. That means the two companies can complete their deal within 
weeks or days and then gamble that the government lawsuit fails to 
untangle them. Northwest would eventually hold a controlling interest 
in Continental, but the airlines argue that various safeguards in 
the deal would insure that the two would continue competing. Steve 
Innskeep, NPR News, Washington.
