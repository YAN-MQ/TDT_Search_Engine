Russian space agency is preparing an extravagant experiment with a 
space mirror that would illuminate sun-starved northern cities and 
act as a ``solar sail,'' officials said on Friday. The Znamya (Banner) 
experiment is to be launched next February and envisages unfolding 
a space mirror made of a membrane covered by a metal layer. In theory, 
the mirror is to work like the moon, reflecting sunlight onto some 
northern parts of Russia during the long nights. The mirror, around 
100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, would serve as a prototype for even 
larger models that may go up later, provided the cash-strapped space 
agency comes up with funds, said Mission Control spokesman Valery 
Lyndin. ``Of course, longer-term prospects are unclear, given the 
current fund shortage,'' Lyndin said in a telephone interview. According 
to the plan, the folded membrane is to be attached to a Progress cargo 
ship, which is scheduled to blast off for the Mir space station on 
Sunday and dock with it on Tuesday. The Progress will unfold the mirror 
in February, when the cargo ship will be undocked from the Mir. Usually, 
it would be discarded. The station's crew will guide the cargo ship 
using manual controls to see how the mirror performs. Lyndin said 
that the scientists will also study the membrane as a potential ``solar 
sail,'' a feature that might allow spaceships of the distant future 
to sail through space using solar wind. In February 1993, Russia ran 
a similar experiment, but the mirror was barely visible on Earth, 
Lyndin said. The new Znamya also would be visible only in good weather 
and to those who knew its precise position in orbit. It would resemble 
a shooting star, not a large object such as the moon. The mirror had 
been scheduled to be taken to the orbit earlier, but the experiment 
has been delayed due to the fund shortage. The money crunch has also 
led to the postponement of the new Progress launch, which had been 
originally planned for Oct. 15. Along with the mirror, which weighs 
only about 4 kilograms (less than nine pounds), the cargo ship will 
deliver some 2.5 tons of regular cargo, including fuel, food, water, 
equipment and other supplies to the Mir, Lyndin said. Among the equipment 
is a French-made device to study a stream of micro-meteorites bombarding 
Mir's surface. Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev 
will go on a spacewalk tentatively scheduled for Nov. 11 to attach 
the gauge to the station's outer surface, Lyndin said. Space officials 
initially planned to keep the 12-year-old Mir in orbit through the 
end of 1999, but the last crew is now expected to depart next June 
because of the money shortage.
