Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di Canio was banned for 11 games 
and fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,900) Friday for pushing a referee 
to the ground in a Sept. 26 match. The 30-year-old Italian learned 
of his punishment after appearing before a three-man Football Association 
disciplinary panel. Di Canio, who was suspended immediately after 
the home match by his Sheffield club, had reportedly faced a possible 
ban of up to six months from the English game. ``I'm very, very sorry 
for what happened,'' he said at a news conference after the verdict 
was announced. ``I had a fair hearing and I accept that.'' The club 
said there would be no appeal. The suspension is likely to keep Di 
Canio out of the game until early January. The 11-match ban includes 
an automatic three-game suspension for receiving a red card. Di Canio 
has already served one game of the suspension and will now miss another 
10 before returning to action. Referee Paul Alcock was pushed to the 
ground after he gave Di Canio a red card for his part in a brawl in 
the final minutes of the first half of the game against Arsenal. Arsenal's 
Martin Keown was also sent off as a melee among a dozen players broke 
out following a tussle between Arsenal's Patrick Vieira and Wim Jonk. 
Di Canio later suggested Alcock play-acted and compared him to a player 
diving to draw a penalty. ``I pushed (the ref) in the stomach,'' Di 
Canio said last month. ``He took 3-4 steps sideways and fell like 
a player'' who dives for a penalty. Alcock, who denied Di Canio's 
allegation, said he considered quitting the sport after the incident 
but had since changed his mind. ``I am certainly not going to let 
something like this beat me,'' Alcock said Thursday. ``I was caught 
totally by surprise and the shock caused me to lose my balance.'' 
``I thought on the way home whether I really need the pressure of 
this particular incident and I have thought over the past two or three 
weeks whether I need to carry on. ``But at the end of the day I am 
certainly not going to let an incident like that stop me refereeing.''
