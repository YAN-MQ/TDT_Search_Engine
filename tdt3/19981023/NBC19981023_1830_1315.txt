Time now for the "fleecing of America." The past few years have been 
good years for the U.S. postal service. They've turned a profit, improved 
on time delivery rates, but recently, the postal service threw a going-away 
party for their leader, which turned into a first-class "fleecing." 
Here's NBC's Bob Kur. It was the kind of tribute normally reserved 
for Washington's elite -- a huge party at Washington's historic union 
train station. But critics say it turned into an extravagant "fleecing 
of America." A farewell party for postmaster general Marvin runyan 
and 400 guests. The cost -- more than $120,000. If you use stamps, 
you helped pay for it, because the Bill was paid by money the postal 
service takes in. Enough to cause some to cry, "return to spender." 
Congressman John McHugh runs the committee that monitors postal service 
operations. Something was out of control. There was no controlling 
factor, no controlling mechanism. It's ironic. For his six-year tenure 
as postmaster general, runyan was praised for cost- cutting, modernizing 
and making the postal service more efficient. So how did postal board 
officials thank runyan? By picking union station, an architectural 
gem and one of the most expensive places in Washington, for a party. 
By day, a mix of travelers and shoppers. By night, a party palace 
for Washington's powerful. How did the Bill get so high? $75,000 to 
rent union station. Programs, invitations and menus -- $21,000. Travel 
expenses for out-of-town guests -- about $15,000. A video tribute 
-- $5,000. And commemorative mementos honoring runyan -- $1,800. Add 
it all up, and the money spent for the party was enough to mail 376,000 
letters at 32 cents a piece. And there's more -- the same postal board 
that okayed the costly party voted one week later to raise the price 
of stamps and other postal services in January. When taxpayers lick 
that first 33-cent stamp on January 10th, 1999, they ought to keep 
in mind the $120,000 party that they were not invited to and the $4 
billion debt the postal service still has. Postal service officials 
would not respond on camera. In a telephone interview, Marvin runyan 
said the cost was "unfortunate" but that, "it was a great party." 
Also a great example of a first-class "fleecing of America." Bob Kur, 
NBC news, Washington.
