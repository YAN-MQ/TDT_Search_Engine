In the moments before the start of the third period, New Jersey Devils 
Coach Robbie Ftorek stood alone at the darkened bench. With his team 
still in the locker room, Ftorek paced back and forth. He had already 
seen his team break out of the scoring drought that plagued the Devils 
through the early going this season. Now, he needed to find a way 
to hold the lead against the unbeaten Philadelphia Flyers for the 
final 20 minutes. Randy McKay, back in the lineup for the first time 
this season after sitting out the first four games with a groin strain, 
made it easier for Ftorek to watch, scoring 29 seconds into the third 
period to give the Devils a two-goal cushion. The goal provided Martin 
Brodeur with what must have seemed like a flurry of goals after seeing 
the Devils score only six goals in their first four games, and he 
preserved the lead for a 3-2 victory at First Union Center. For the 
Devils, despite their early season struggles and the Flyers starting 
the season with a 4-0-1 mark, it was business as usual. Last season, 
the Devils were 4-0-1 against the Flyers. So, no matter that the goals 
came on a power play, while short-handed, and with McKay sliding toward 
the net on his stomach, for the Devils it was a hopeful sign that 
a return to form is coming. ``I know it's early in the season, but 
that was the biggest game of the year,'' McKay said. ``It's a good 
confidence builder.'' Brodeur added: ``It's big. Just the fact that 
the Flyers hadn't lost yet and we came in struggling, it woke us up.'' 
Eric Lindros cut the lead to 3-2 with 6 minutes 49 seconds to play, 
picking up a John LeClair pass in front and slipping the puck between 
Brodeur's legs. Afterward, the Flyers did not want to hear talk of 
last season. ``Last year is last year,'' LeClair said. ``This is a 
new year. We haven't struggled, but we haven't won as many as we should 
have against them. They had our number a little bit. We'll find a 
way to beat them later.'' But now would have seemed the time. The 
Flyers entered the game unbeaten with 14 goals scored and 5 allowed, 
while the Devils were 1-3 and had showed little inclination for putting 
the puck in the net. And after a sloppy start, the Devils admitted 
afterward that they were fortunate to be trailing by just 1-0 after 
the first period. The Devils were 1 of 10 on power plays entering 
the game, and after squandering their first opportunity tonight, they 
struck quickly on their second chance. When Lindros was sent off for 
interference at 6:26 of the second period, it took only eight seconds 
for the Devils to get on the board, tying the game at 1-1 when Jason 
Arnott blasted a shot from the top of the right circle and Brendan 
Morrison, stationed in front of the net, deflected the shot past John 
Vanbiesbrouck for his first goal of the season. The Devils then added 
their first short-handed goal of the season, also in the second period, 
when Scott Stevens cleaned up a rebound of a Dave Babych shot, flicking 
it toward the Flyer goal. Brian Rolston outraced the Flyers to the 
puck, picking it up just past the red line, and as he swooped toward 
the goal with Babych in pursuit, he flipped the puck in the air as 
he was falling down, dropping it over the left shoulder of Vanbiesbrouck 
for a 2-1 Devils' lead.
