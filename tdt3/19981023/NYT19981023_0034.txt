Francis W. Sargent, the moderate Republican, defender of the environment 
and solver of fiscal crises who served as governor of Massachusetts 
from 1969 to 1975, died on Thursday at his home in Dover, Mass. He 
was 83. Sargent moved up from lieutenant governor when Gov. John Volpe 
was made transportation secretary in the Nixon administration and 
was elected in 1970 over the mayor of Boston, Kevin White, to a full 
term. Sargent was also known for his delicately middle-of-the-road 
approach to Boston's busing strife and helped gain passage of a no-fault 
car insurance law. He backed public housing, environmental protections 
and a statute challenging the Vietnam War on legal grounds. Sargent 
was born in Massachusetts, attended the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, (which led to a favorite motto of his: ``Don't ask me, 
I didn't go to Harvard.'') and went on to serve in a variety of state 
and federal jobs involving fish, game, and other natural resources. 
He lost an election for the state Senate in 1962 but ran successfully 
in 1966 for lieutenant governor. His campaign slogan was ``Put Sarge 
in charge.'' As governor, he set a record by signing 1,000 new laws 
in 1971, and in 1972, he won a battle he called his own Vietnam: he 
helped defeat a plan for an ``inner belt'' expressway in Boston. But 
in his run for re-election during a sour economic period in 1974 he 
lost to his Democratic challenger, Michael Dukakis, and stayed out 
of the central fray of politics from then on, though he taught and 
wrote commentary in his later years. During the friction-filled busing 
period in Boston in the early 1970s, Sargent responded to the racial 
tension raised by the integration plan to shuttle black and white 
children between neighborhoods by proposing a ``freedom of choice'' 
scheme that would have allowed white children to remain in their neighborhoods 
while black children were bused to better schools. Sargent was married 
since 1938 to his wife, Jessie, with whom he had three children, Jessie, 
Fay and Bill. He was decorated for his service as a paratrooper in 
World War II. Upon his return from the war, he lived on Cape Cod, 
and, an enthusiastic fisherman, became interested in environmental 
issues when he saw the effects of overfishing there. A profile earlier 
this month in The Boston Globe described Sargent as the last of a 
breed of homegrown Yankee governors that included names like Saltonstall, 
Peabody and Bradford. In person, he has been described as salty and 
flinty in typical Yankee fashion. His penchant for economizing came 
in handy when Massachusetts hit a budgetary crisis brought on largely 
by high welfare costs. In response, Sargent pushed legislation that 
altered eligibility requirements for Medicaid and imposed a new tax 
on special interests and corporations. Sargent suffered from heart 
trouble, and had recently been sharply restricted in his activities, 
unable to drive or fish anymore. He had open-heart surgery in 1981. 
But in his interview with The Globe, he sounded as feisty as ever, 
asking at one point, ``How'd I get to be so old?''
