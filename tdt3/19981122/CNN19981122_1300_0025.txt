But first -- Iraq insists it is cooperating with the United Nations 
despite failing to hand over documents pertaining to its weapons program. 
U.N. weapons inspectors were on the job today in Baghdad, where Iraq's 
foreign minister claims all available documents, more than 2 million, 
have been turned over. The Iraqi ambassador to the U.N. claims the 
other files do not exist or were destroyed after the gulf war. Some 
congressional leaders don't buy it and are calling for military action. 
Those documents are not existing. Cooperation is being extended. Besides, 
they wanted to visit and more teams could come up. Mr. Butler could 
go to Baghdad at some point and sit down and work out the different 
files. A review could come later. The question of missing paper should 
not be not an issue that has to do with any noncompliance or noncooperation. 
I don't see it that way. I think there will be because it's apparent, 
I believe it. It's apparent last week that Saddam Hussein is not going 
to cooperate. Iraq wants to retain these weapons of mass destruction 
as sort of the reason of being Saddam. He is not only a dictator who 
has the potential to produce these weapons, but the political will 
to use them, and until the world gets that straight really through 
our heads, we will be in difficulty. This is a menace, not only to 
the area, but to the security of the United States. Democratic senator 
Joseph Biden of Delaware says it's clear that it's time to go after 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
