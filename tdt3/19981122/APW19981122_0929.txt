A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed early Sunday in an entertainment 
district of Bogota after an argument in a bar, authorities said. Frank 
Arnold Moreno, 37, was shot once in the back in the city's ``Zona 
Rosa,'' or Pink Zone, at about 1 a.m. outside the El Divino bar, U.S. 
and Colombian officials said. A bystander was also shot and wounded 
in the neck, they said, adding that police had various witnesses and 
were pursuing a suspect. Moreno, who had been in Colombia for about 
a year, had gone to the bar with a male Colombian friend, police said, 
and was slain after what one U.S. Embassy official called ``a bar 
brawl.'' ``I don't think it had anything to do with drugs,'' said 
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I understand 
he was walking away and then boom, boom.'' The Drug Enforcement Administration 
agent was shot from behind and the 9mm bullet entered his torso at 
kidney level, a senior Colombian police official said on condition 
of anonymity. Witnesses took Moreno to a Bogota hospital, where he 
was declared dead. It was not immediately known whether Moreno was 
carrying a gun, who shot the bystander or how many shots were fired 
by the assailant, the police official said. He identified the wounded 
man as Hugo Alberto Espinosa, 20, who was outside the bar with friends 
and not involved in the argument. Authorities said Moreno, his friend 
and the gunman had been told to leave the bar because of a heated 
argument. The shooting occurred in Bogota's most active nightlife 
area, an upscale neighborhood or restaurants, bars and discotheques 
that is crowded with people well after midnight on weekends. Moreno, 
of Edinburg, Texas, was recently married and had previously been assigned 
to Oklahoma City, officials said, adding that his wife lived with 
him in Bogota. Police said the body was being flown to the United 
States on Sunday night.
