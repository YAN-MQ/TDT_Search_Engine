One out of every five local television news directors around the country 
say their stations have declined to broadcast some news reports in 
the last year because of fears of possible lawsuits, according to 
a recent survey conducted by the University of Miami. The study found 
that an additional 28 percent of the news directors polled reported 
omitting key information from a news report out of similar concerns. 
The study, which was conducted by the Center for the Advancement of 
Modern Media at the University of Miami School of Communication, tracked 
the responses of 360 local television news directors and compared 
them with the results of a survey taken three years ago. The percentage 
of those questioned who said their stations had been sued for libel 
in the last three years increased by 8 percentage points, to 38 percent, 
the study found. To stave off possible lawsuits, stations are consulting 
lawyers more frequently before broadcasting news reports than they 
did in 1995. Also, the percentage of those who have hired professional 
news consultants in the last three years grew to 78 percent from 59 
percent three years ago, according to the survey. Despite growing 
concerns about liability, however, more news stations have resorted 
to aggressive news-gathering tactics. This is because while legal 
concerns among the stations have deepened, the added competition from 
more nightly news magazines and 24-hour news channels has threatened 
their ratings, forcing them to seek out riskier stories in a bid to 
grab the audience's attention, experts said. ``There is a greater 
propensity to sue,'' said Paul Driscoll, one of the study's authors. 
``More business executives carry insurance that allows them to sue.'' 
He added: ``There is so much pressure on news directors to get higher 
ratings that they've got to do all kinds of stories that will keep 
the audience's attention.'' More television news programs _ 63 percent, 
compared with 53 percent three years ago _ resorted to the use of 
hidden microphones and hidden cameras as a means for gathering material, 
according to the survey.
