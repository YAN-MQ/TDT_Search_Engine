Stock car driver Mike Skinner knew how to outrace rising Winston Cup 
star Jeff Gordon on an oval track with a few challenging turns. The 
41-year-old resident of Susansville, California, took the lead on 
the 140th of 201 laps, outdueled Gordon in the final corner and won 
by 0.153 seconds Sunday, his second straight NASCAR exhibition race 
victory in Japan. Skinner posted an unofficial time of 2 hours, 45 
minutes, 58.000 seconds, or 112.558 mph (180.09 kph) in his Monte 
Carlo Chevrolet. Organizers, unable to provide official times because 
of computer problems, gave only Skinner's winning margin over Gordon, 
who also drove a Chevrolet. Jeremy Mayfield was third in a Taurus 
Ford. The NASCAR Thunder Special Coca-Cola 500 was the third and last 
race in a three-year series held under a contract with Japanese organizers 
to promote the sport worldwide. In 1996, Rusty Wallace won the event 
at the 1.54-mile (2.46-kilometer) Suzuka Circuitland road course, 
and Skinner triumphed last year, also at Suzuka. The victory Sunday 
was worth dlrs 134,045 from a purse of dlrs 1 million. Skinner started 
from the third position, behind Mayfield and Gordon, and made his 
charge on the 140th lap around the 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) Motegi 
Twin Ring track. He kept the lead to the end in a close contest that 
saw half a dozen crashes. No drivers involved were reported seriously 
injured. ``Our car was very, very good. When we put tires on it, it 
would just go,'' said Skinner. ``I probably cool my tires down more 
than anybody else. Our car on hot tires would push very, very bad.'' 
He added that Gordon was better over short runs along the course, 
while his car did better on the long runs. ``We knew we had to stop 
at the corners ... and just go really slow getting in there and really 
slow in coming out just like in the road race at Suzuka,'' said Skinner, 
formerly a Craftsman Truck Series star. He is a specialist in road 
racing. Because of crashes, mechanical failures and engine trouble, 
only 17 drivers in a field of 31 finished all 201 laps. The field 
included 13 Winston Cup stars, 11 Winston Cup West competitors, four 
Japanese, two Busch Grand drivers and one from the Craftsman Truck 
Series. Last year, Skinner was the Winston Cup's 40-year-old rookie 
of the year when he drove to his first victory in high-level competition 
at Suzuka. In Sunday's race, Gordon, of Pittsboro, Indiana, was seeking 
his 14th victory of the season. At age 27, he was the youngest driver 
to win three Winston Cup championships. Mayfield, from Owensboro, 
Kentucky, won his only Winston Cup title in the Pocono 500 at Long 
Pond, Pennsylvania, in June. Bill France, president of NASCAR, said 
at the opening ceremony that said the race will continue in the future. 
``I'm very pleased to announce that we'll return again in 1999 with 
our stock cars and hope that you'll be here to join us once again,'' 
he said. Japanese racing officials said details have yet to be worked 
out for the Winston Cup West to have a race of its championship series 
staged in Japan.
