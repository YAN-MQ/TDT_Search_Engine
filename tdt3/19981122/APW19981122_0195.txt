Lebanon marked Independence Day on Sunday with a military parade and 
a pledge to fight Israel. Army infantry units marched to a military 
band and bagpipers, followed by freshly painted tanks and armored 
vehicles, along an avenue near the National Museum in downtown Beirut. 
The parade route was symbolic of peace and national unity because 
it had served as a killing ground and a crossing point between the 
divided capital during the 1975-90 civil war between Muslims and Christians. 
President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and other top officials 
looked on. President-elect Emile Lahoud, the army commander who will 
be inaugurated Tuesday, stayed away to give Hrawi his last show as 
leader but later joined in a reception. On the eve of the 55th Independence 
from France, Hrawi pledged in a televised address: ``We will not give 
up one grain of our national soil and our national dignity.'' Israel 
occupies 10 percent of Lebanese territory in the south, which it says 
is necessary to protect its border towns against attack. It has held 
onto the land since 1985, despite efforts by Lebanese guerrillas to 
oust occupying the force. Hrawi also reiterated Lebanon's commitment 
to Middle East peace based on the ``land for peace'' principle, pledging 
to stick with neighboring Syria in any negotiations with Israel. Israel 
has offered to withdraw from Lebanon in exchange for security guarantees. 
Both Lebanon and Syria, the main power broker in this country where 
it maintains 30,000 troops, rejected the offer. Lahoud, who was elected 
by Parliament Oct. 15 after winning popular backing and the all-important 
approval of Syrian President Hafez Assad, has rebuilt the fractured 
military since he became the nation's top general in 1989. He has 
brought the army closer to Syria's military and has taken a hard line 
on the conflict with Israel _ though the army has largely stayed out 
of the fighting in the south. ``I am confident that the prime mission 
of the army will continue to be the resistance until the end of the 
Israeli occupation,'' he said in his Order of the Day comments to 
the troops. ``Israel is the enemy ... Syria is the friend,'' Lahoud's 
orders said. Despite Sunday's ceremony, some Lebanese feel Independence 
Day remains marred by Israel's occupation and Syria's virtual control 
of decision-making in this nation wedged between the two powerful 
Middle Eastern foes. U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a letter 
to Hrawi that Washington supports the independence, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of Lebanon. He added that the United States 
remains committed to achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace 
in the Middle East.
