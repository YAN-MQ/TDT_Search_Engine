As if Saddam's weapons of mass destruction weren't enough to worry 
about today, the president focused attention on south Korea, which 
borders a Country headed by another dictator who is defying weapons 
inspectors. NBC's Claire Shipman is in Seoul, south Korea, tonight. 
President Clinton paid a call on U.S. and Korean troops Sunday -- 
men and women who monitor the most heavily guarded border in the world, 
the demilitarized zone which still separates north from south Korea 
45 years after the war. And against that backdrop of military might, 
Clinton, for the second time in two days, warned about the possibility 
of increasing dangers to the north. One of the greatest threats the 
world now faces is weapons of mass destruction. And though our attention 
lately has been focused on Iraq's efforts in that area, north Korea 
is also a dangerous battleground. Here it is critical to this most 
dangerous battleground so we must remain vigilant. And thanks to you, 
we are. 37,000 American troops are on duty in Korea. And the president 
got a full tour of the training center -- presiding over a promotion 
from private to specialist, and sharing military Chow, MREs meals 
ready to eat. This visit comes at a time when there are new concerns 
about north Korea's intentions. The U.S. believes that a large hole 
the north Koreans are digging in the side of a mountain 25 miles outside 
of P'yongyang might be nuclear related. The north Koreans won't allow 
inspections. And the White House is also worried about recent missile 
tests by the cash-strapped nation, which may be looking to sell missiles 
for cash. The south Koreans, in an economic crunch of their own, think 
the best way to avoid a larger crisis is by continuing to encourage 
warmer relations between north Korea and the non-communist world. 
But the "north Korean daily" today accused the United States of provoking 
tension, even planning preemptive military attack. It appears that 
one of the Clinton administration's early victories the 1994 accord 
in which the north agreed to abandon its nuclear program may be on 
shaky ground. Claire Shipman, NBC news, Seoul.
