Commercial tankers get much of the blame for oil spills, but it turns 
out vessels in the U.S. Navy are far more frequent polluters. The 
associated press found between 1990 and '97, a Navy vessel fouled 
U.S. waters, on average, every two days. It was especially bad at 
big Navy bases -- like puget sound in Washington, polluted with 56,000 
gallons. Norfolk, Virginia, where 37,000 gallons spilled. And San 
Diego, where 33,000 gallons polluted the waterfront. The main reason 
for the spills -- complex, outdated fuel transfer systems aboard the 
ships, as well as human error.
