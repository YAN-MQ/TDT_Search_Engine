The Israeli army demolished a house Sunday used as a hide-out by two 
wanted Hamas leaders before they were killed by Israeli troops earlier 
this year. The two fugitives, Adel and Imad Awadallah, were wanted 
by Palestinian authorities and Israel for alleged involvement in attacks 
that killed at least five Israelis and wounded 51 more. After several 
weeks of searches, the army found and killed the two brothers in a 
rented home on the outskirts of the West Bank city of Hebron on Sept. 
11. The owner of the home, Akram Mussauda was arrested shortly afterwards 
by Israel for harboring fugitives. Israel has destroyed dozens of 
Palestinian homes over the last several years, either as a means of 
collective punishment for families of militants, or because the homes 
were built without permits. An Israeli army spokesman said Sunday 
that the empty home, surrounded by vineyards and peach trees, was 
illegal since it had been built without Israeli permission. Two bulldozers 
guarded by dozens of Israeli soldiers destroyed the house as Mussauda's 
two brothers looked on. The brothers said they would have appealed 
the decision to Israel's Supreme Court but were only notified 30 minutes 
before the bulldozers arrived. Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian peace-making 
and has claimed responsibility for dozens of deadly attacks on Israelis. 
The Awadallah brothers were also suspected of being behind the killing 
of Hamas bombmaker as part of an internal feud in the group.
