Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis closed out their successful run as 
the top doubles team Sunday by beating Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor 
6-4, 6-2, 7-5 for the Phoenix ATP World Doubles championship. Eltingh 
is retiring from tennis after the tournament. The 28-year-old became 
a father this year and wants to stay close to his family in The Netherlands. 
He leaves the game as the No. 1 player on the ATP Tour individual 
doubles ranking, 873 points ahead of his partner. Knee problems in 
1997 forced him to retire from singles play in 1997. Moments after 
the match, Eltingh said he has no desire to return. ``I feel good,'' 
he said. ``How can I make `goodbye' better than it was this year.'' 
The Dutchmen needed less than two hours to beat Knowles, of the Bahamas, 
and Nestor, of Canada. The win capped a 5-0 record at the tournament, 
where they won 11 of 12 sets and were broken just three times. It 
also extended their dominance over Knowles and Nestor at 9-1. They 
did not face a break point in either the semifinals or the championship. 
They broke Knowles' service game once in the first and third set and 
twice in the second set. The few times they were down on serve, Eltingh 
and Haarhuis consistently pulled themselves out of trouble behind 
Haarhuis' accurate serves and Eltingh's athletic volleys at the net. 
Haarhuis, 32, had five of the team's nine aces. Eltingh showed his 
range of talents in the fourth game of the second set. Down 2-1, Eltingh 
scored with a deeply angled ace. Later he countered a sharply hit 
return by leaping high for a kill and then closed out the game with 
a soft backhand drop shot that caught his opponents standing deep. 
Almost fittingly, he served out for match point. Up 40-0, the pair 
lost the next two points but closed out their high-flying run when 
Nestor sent a baseline volley long. Eltingh and Haarhuis finished 
the year with a 46-4 record, the best percentage on the ATP Tour this 
season. They won nine titles in 13 events. They picked up dlrs 258,500 
in Hartford and have earned more than dlrs 6 million as a doubles 
team in their seven years together. Since 1991, they have won 39 titles, 
including this year at Wimbledon. With the win at Wimbledon, they 
became the first pair to win all four Grand Slam titles as a team. 
``It's glorious to end it this way,'' said Haarhuis, who admitted 
he is said to see his partner and friend leave. ``I'd like to play 
another seven years with him,'' Haarhuis said. ``There's so many things 
we're not going to share anymore _ a victory, a dinner or a joke.'' 
``Or a loss,'' Eltingh interjected. ``I don't remember too many of 
those,'' said Haarhuis.
