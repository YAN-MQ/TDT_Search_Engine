After exchanging angry invective for two days, mediators from the 
Mexican Congress and top leaders of the Zapatista rebels managed Sunday 
to salvage some semblance of peace talks, but only barely. What was 
perhaps most striking about the disastrous meeting _ the first such 
face-to-face encounter in nearly two years _ was that the Zapatistas 
seemed to have lost their touch for media showmanship and public diplomacy 
on behalf of their Indian cause. Zapatista commanders had said that 
they had finally reached out to the mediating legislators, federal 
senators and deputies who are members of the Concord and Pacification 
Commission, to demonstrate a renewed commitment to a peace dialogue. 
But the 29 Zapatista delegates, led by a fierce commander who goes 
by the nom de guerre of Tacho, surprised the legislators with a flurry 
of last-minute logistical demands. The Zapatistas refused to discuss 
the problems with the lawmakers privately and then called them racist 
in front of 2,500 cheering supporters gathered here for a parallel 
Zapatista meeting. One legislator said that Tacho had told them he 
did not want to listen to their comments because they were ``pure 
saliva.'' The Zapatistas, rough-hewn Indian guerrillas who have lived 
hidden in harsh jungles since they staged a weeklong armed uprising 
in January 1994, gave the impression that they were dissatisfied mainly 
because their fax machine was not working and they were not given 
mattresses for their cots. The legislators responded late Saturday 
night with a five-page communique in which they rejected the Zapatistas' 
complaints in blunt terms. ``We are not your enemies _ you did not 
declare war on us,'' said the legislators, who are serving only as 
neutral go-betweens for the rebels and the government. The lawmakers 
accused the Zapatistas of showing no interest in peace. In an ultimatum, 
they said if they did not get more respectful treatment from the rebels, 
``We are at your disposal to take you back to the places where you 
came from.'' In the end mediators and rebels agreed to get together 
again late Sunday evening. The Zapatistas released a communique Saturday 
morning in which they said, as they have before, that they would not 
return to direct peace talks until the government meets five broad 
conditions, including army withdrawal from Zapatista areas and freeing 
of political prisoners. The government has not accepted the conditions 
in the two years since the negotiations fell apart. Even some of the 
Zapatistas' most loyal supporters said they were dismayed. ``You can't 
insult someone and then say it was all right because that is the Indian 
way,'' commented Carlos Monsivais, a prominent writer and social critic, 
who is attending the meetings here. Subcommander Marcos, a non-Indian 
who is the Zapatistas' de facto leader, did not come to the sessions 
here, but instead sent an audio recording in which he railed against 
the globalization of the world economy but offered no concrete peace 
proposals. The diplomatic debacle overshadowed substantial progress 
the Zapatistas made in the strategy sessions with their followers 
here. In a sign that they are continuing to shape themselves into 
a civilian political group in preparation for one day laying down 
arms, they organized their sympathizers to mount a nationwide mobilization 
sometime next year to publicize their platform for greater Indian 
independence.
