How much would you pay for a poster of king Kong? How about $62,000? 
A Massachusetts man made that record bid at an auction in Boston for 
a Poster from the 1933 movie. The poster is one of four known to exist. 
It shows king Kong cradling Fay wray and snarling at the New York 
skyline. The poster was expected to bring in between $30,000 and $50,000.
