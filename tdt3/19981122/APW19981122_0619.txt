A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed early Sunday in a shootout in 
an entertainment district of Bogota, authorities said. The agent, 
Frank Arnold Moreno, was killed outside a bar in the city's so-called 
Pink Zone at 84th street, officials said. U.S. officials and Colombian 
police offered no further details about the killing, which occurred 
about 1 a.m., according to a short statement released by the U.S. 
Embassy ``At this point I have nothing at all about the circumstances,'' 
said DEA chief spokesman Van Quarles in Washington. He said he also 
did not have information about Moreno's age, hometown or duties with 
the agency. The DEA has an estimated 50 agents in Colombia, the world's 
leading producer and exporter of cocaine.
