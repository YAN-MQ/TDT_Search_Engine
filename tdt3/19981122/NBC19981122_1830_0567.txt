As Congress continues its impeachment inquiry, one of the president's 
lawyers indicated today that Mr. Clinton could accept a punishment 
short of impeachment for the Monica Lewinsky affair. But for now, 
there is no deal. NBC's Joe Johns is on Capitol Hill tonight. Eager 
to clear the air before he takes over, house speaker-to-be bob Livingston 
said, on NBC's "meet the press" that if the Judiciary committee approves 
impeachment articles this year, he'll ask outgoing speaker Newt Gingrich 
to hold a special session to resolve the issue before the next Congress 
is sworn in. I wouldn't imagine it will take a lot of debate. Most 
of the issues have been on the table for the last year and consider 
two or three hours of debate, vote the issue up or down, and be done 
with it. But with an 11-seat republican majority in the current house, 
and as many as 20 republicans considering voting against impeachment, 
some doubt whether the issue will even be passed on to the Senate. 
Right now with the political landscape, I would say no. a few argue 
that the process itself is part of the president's penalty, regardless 
of the outcome. Some people are also feeling that the president needs 
some sort of punishment, and if that is all it would be, then that 
is all it would be. The house Judiciary committee, which just last 
week heard testimony from independent counsel Kenneth Starr,is continuing 
its work. It has just sent out subpoenas for closed-door interviews 
with White House counsel Bruce Lindsey, presidential attorney Robert 
Bennett, and two witnesses in the case of Kathleen Willey, who claimed 
democrats charge the interviews will serve no useful purpose. The 
facts have been on the table for a very long time. We all should have 
made up our minds a while ago. Calls for censure are continuing. But 
for now, the house Judiciary committee expects a vote on articles 
of impeachment the early part of December. Joe Johns, NBC news, the 
capitol.
