This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather update." 
A stationary front across the gulf of Mexico will keep a chance of 
showers and thunderstorms across the gulf states and into Florida. 
Another area of low pressure will be moving out of the plains but 
we continue to see a series of pacific storms moving into the northwest. 
So heavy rain and some snow possible from San Francisco to the puget 
sound. The snow will mainly be in the mountains inland. Otherwise, 
high pressure will dominate most of the nation's midsection. High 
temperatures will be in the 30s for most of Maine today, 40s and 50s 
across the northern tier with 60s and 70s across the south. Our extended 
forecast shows another heavy rain event for the northwest as a Pacific 
storm system moves in once again. A mix of rain and snow is expected 
for the Rockies and the plains with scattered thunderstorms across 
the gulf. Heavy rain, heavy snow in the Great Lakes on Wednesday. 
Another in a series of storms move into the northwest coast and the 
effects linger into Thursday. The extended forecast for more than 
7,000 cities can be found on your PC at cNN.com.
