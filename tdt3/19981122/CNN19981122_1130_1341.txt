According to reports out of New York, George Steinbrenner will sell 
the yankees to cablevision systems for roughly $600 million. Cablevision 
owns Madison square garden and the Knicks and rangers, but the boss 
will continue to be the boss, retaining control of the club. Steinbrenner 
bought the Yankees for $10 million back in 1973. It would be the richest 
deal ever for a U.S. sports team. Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports."
