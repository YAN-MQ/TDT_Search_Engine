The government will send about 300 teachers in roving teams to hinterland 
villages, including those infested with communist or Muslim rebels, 
to teach residents reading, writing and arithmetic, an official said 
Sunday. The tutorial program, which starts next month, is aimed at 
out-of-school youths and illiterate senior citizens, the official 
said. Although the Philippines has a high literacy rate, many remote 
rural and tribal areas remain out of reach of basic government services 
like education. Education Undersecretary Victor Andres Manhit said 
the teachers would teach 40 hours a week in each area until residents 
learn how to read and write and do basic mathematics. He did not say 
how long the program would last. Manhit said the program is part of 
President Joseph Estrada's promise to reach out to illiterate Filipinos 
in remote areas and those isolated by the country's insurgency problems. 
Estrada, who took office in June, has promised to devote his six-year 
term to easing the plight of millions of poor Filipinos.
