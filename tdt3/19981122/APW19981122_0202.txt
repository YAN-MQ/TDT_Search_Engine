Iranian police have seized 1.4 metric tons (1.5 tons) of drugs in 
northeastern Iran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported 
Sunday. Anti-drug agents in Khorasan province confiscated the opium 
in two separate raids on Friday, the agency said. It said two smugglers 
were arrested during the raids and their vehicles confiscated. Large 
drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies on a route used by smugglers 
to get drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to the oil-rich Gulf and 
Europe. Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988. 
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates 
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity 
of narcotics.
