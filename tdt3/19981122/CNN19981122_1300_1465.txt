Holly Hunter is "living out loud" in her latest Hollywood film. And 
the award-winning actress also has teamed up with a familiar partner 
for a different kind of project. Cynthia Tornquist reports. Where 
are you going? Liz invited me to this after-hours place downtown -- 
Holly Hunter's latest film, "living out loud," casts her as a Woman 
who discovers her place in the world through a series of relationships. 
It is familiar territory for the actress who has earned an academy 
award playing another woman who felt out of place, in "the piano." 
Now, you'll be able to play it. But Hunter's exploration of the female 
psyche is not limited to film. She has brought her talents to the 
New York stage with "impossible marriage." She is a woman who is trying 
to prevent the marriage of her younger sister. She's trying to sabotage 
the wedding. I must ask you, why are you marrying this man? "impossible 
marriage" marks the seventh collaboration between actress holly Hunter 
and playwright Beth henley. Hunter and henley seem to have a lot in 
common. Both are southern. Both share a physical resemblance. And 
both have helped each other's careers. Henley launched Hunter's stage 
career, while Hunter brought attention to henley's plays with her 
quirky performances. Beth is fragile, and she's ferocious. And I think 
she's a poet as well. And very few poets are working today as playwrights. 
Well, I just feel lucky every time she plays one of my characters, 
because she has a sort of innate instinct of how these characters 
think on a deeper level than I even conceive. Henley's other plays 
include "the wake of jamey Foster," "the lucky spot" and "abundance." 
She's also written for the big screen, including the film "nobody's 
fool," along with adaptations of two of her own plays. "Crimes of 
the heart" won her a Pulitzer prize in 1981 and earned her an academy 
award nomination. "The miss firecracker contest" cast Hunter as a 
beauty queen wanna-be. Hunter says she relates to henley's characters. 
I think she deals with breaking out, with protest. But it's protest 
in a very civilized structure. And who better to play it than an actress 
who has made a career of living out loud on film and stage. Cynthia 
Tornquist, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
