A key witness in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos 
Aires will testify before a Brazilian federal judge this week, reports 
said. Wilson dos Santos, a Brazilian citizen, is believed to have 
information about the 1992 bombing of the Jewish center in Buenos 
Aires, which killed 86 people. Dos Santos, who is under police protection, 
was tracked down in Brazil last week. Dos Santos originally testified 
that he alerted Argentine officials four months before the bombing 
that the attack was in the works. He said they did not take him seriously. 
He reportedly said knew about the plans through an Iranian girlfriend 
with links to a terrorist group. But he later retracted his statements, 
prompting an Argentine court to charge him with giving false testimony. 
Dos Santos is prepared to answer a Brazilian judge's questions about 
the case, according to Saturday's O Jornal Do Brasil newspaper. It 
was unclear exactly when he would be testifying.
