Giles Pellerin never scored a touchdown before a huge crowd, never 
struck out a batter, never dunked a basketball, but he compiled one 
of the most remarkable streaks in sports history. On Saturday afternoon, 
Pellerin was at the Rose Bowl, attending his 797th consecutive University 
of Southern California football game, a streak dating to 1926. During 
the second half of the USC-UCLA game, he felt ill and asked his brother 
Oliver, 87, (who was merely attending his 600th consecutive USC game) 
to take him home. But Giles Pellerin collapsed and died in the Rose 
Bowl's parking lot. The man known as USC's Super Fan, and presumably 
America's No. 1 college football fan, was 91. Pellerin's first USC 
game was the 14-3 victory over Penn State in the 1923 Rose Bowl game, 
when he was a student at Huntington Park High School. But his streak 
began three years later, while he was a sophomore at USC. He traveled 
more than 650,000 miles by plane, train and automobile _ visiting 
more than 50 cities, including Tokyo _ and spent upward of $85,000 
in following the Trojans, according to the USC athletic department. 
Going into this season, Pellerin had seen all 69 USC-Notre Dame games 
and all 67 USC-UCLA games. His streak, which began a year before USC's 
white mascot horse, Traveler, started appearing at games, spanned 
11 coaching regimes. In the 1930s, Pellerin's streak almost ended 
well before reaching epic proportions. On his way to a game at Notre 
Dame, his car's water pump broke outside Oklahoma City, 36 hours before 
kickoff. It was fixed, and he made the game. Then there was his honeymoon 
with his bride Jessie. He postponed it eight months so he could celebrate 
at a USC game in Hawaii in 1935. In 1949, Pellerin was hospitalized 
for an appendectomy five days before a home game. The day of the game, 
he told nurses he was going to take a walk on hospital grounds. Instead, 
he went to the Los Angeles Coliseum, saw his beloved USC rout Oregon, 
40-13, then returned to the hospital before anyone realized he had 
been missing. The day after a 1993 game at Penn State, he suffered 
a ruptured abdominal aneurysm when he was about to leave his hotel. 
He was hospitalized in Harrisburg for 12 days, but USC had the following 
weekend off. After signing a waiver absolving hospital officials of 
responsibility for his leaving prematurely, he returned to Los Angeles 
for the USC game against Washington State. Pellerin also attended 
many homes games of USC's other sports teams. When he wasn't busy 
doing all that, he spoke about his streak before service organizations. 
A USC graduate, class of 1929, Pellerin did a lot more for his alma 
mater's athletic program than cheer on the Trojans. A retired telephone 
executive who lived in Pasadena, he donated $1.3 million to endow 
three football scholarships and a swimming scholarship at USC. He 
was inducted into the university's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994. 
``My whole life has been USC football, and I've loved every minute 
of it,'' he once said. In 1988, Pellerin was flown to New York as 
a finalist in the Fisher Nut ``America's Nuttiest Sports Nuts'' contest. 
But that bit of commercial hype aside, he saw nothing bizarre about 
his passion. ``I don't think I'm a nut,'' he said. ``It's all been 
fun. I could've spent a lot more money on other hobbies. A guy can 
spend as much money playing golf or poker. I do more than just watch 
a game when I visit these cities. I've met a lot of nice and interesting 
people.'' Pellerin and his wife, who preceded him in death, had no 
children. So he essentially adopted the USC players, whom Pellerin 
and his brother would meet when the athletes left the team bus at 
road games. ``The players all greet me as the No. 1 Trojan,'' he had 
remarked. ``I think of all the USC players as our family.'' ``God 
must be a Trojan,'' Pellerin once said. ``I've been lucky.''
