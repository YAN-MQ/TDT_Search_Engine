You take a fellow who looks like a goat, travels around with goats, 
eats with goats, lies down among goats and smells like a goat, and 
it won't be long before people will be calling him the Goat Man. Which 
is pretty much what Charles McCartney had in mind back in the Depression 
when he pulled up his Iowa stakes, put on his goatskins, hitched up 
his ironed-wheeled goat wagon and hit the road for what turned out 
to be a three-decade odyssey as one of the United States' most endearing 
eccentrics and by far its most pungent peripatetic roadside tourist 
attraction. It is a tribute to the indelible image he created that 
although he had abandoned the goat life 30 years ago and settled down 
in a school bus in the south Georgia town of Jeffersonville, outside 
Macon, when McCartney died on Nov. 15 in a Macon nursing home, he 
was still known as the Goat Man. He was 97, or a decade or so younger 
than he'd taken to claiming to be. A man given to gross exaggeration 
when simple embellishment would suffice, McCartney also claimed to 
have visited every state except Hawaii: His goats couldn't swim so 
far, he explained, and if they could, they'd just end up eating the 
grass skirts off the hula dancers anyway. Whatever the scope of his 
travels, McCartney, who averaged seven miles a day and had a regular 
route between Iowa and Georgia, spent most of his time creating traffic 
jams throughout the South, primarily along the old Dixie Highway running 
through Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida. As many who grew 
up in the South in the 1940s, '50s and '60s could attest, when the 
Goat Man came to town it was an event, one that inevitably produced 
a story and a photograph in the local paper. When someone spotted 
him and his 30 or so goats coming down the highway, his wagon piled 
high with interesting junk, word would get around and pretty soon 
parents would be driving their children out to meet him, those familiar 
with the drill taking the precaution of staying upwind of the Goat 
Man. As McCartney, who never took a bath or washed his clothes, once 
boasted, nobody but his goats could stand the smell of him. According 
to research by Darryl Patton and Jimmy Hammett, who collaborated on 
a 1993 Goat Man video and a 1994 Goat Man book, McCartney had a colorful 
life even before he became the Goat Man. Growing up on a farm outside 
Sigourney, Iowa, he was considered such an odd child that the family 
goats were about his only true friends, which helps explain why he 
took off at 14, married a 24-year-old Spanish knife thrower, served 
as her exhibition target for a couple of years, and then returned 
to Iowa and married at least twice more. The last marriage ended when 
he sold his goat-weary wife for $1,000 to a farmer she'd already grown 
sweet on. By then, McCartney, who had been forced to trade a farm 
he'd inherited to pay off a grocery bill, had begun his goat excursions, 
initially taking his wife and young son, Albert Gene, along on short 
trips and attracting so much attention that he was soon printing postcards 
with his picture on them to sell to the gawkers. Toward the end of 
the 1930s, he struck off on his own, beginning a series of annual 
circuits and soon making Jeffersonville his home base. Although the 
postcards sold so well that rumors actually spread that he was rich, 
he found a new source of income early in his travels when he stopped 
off in a backwoods section of north Georgia and had what amounted 
to an economic epiphany. Observing that the bearded goat man was the 
spitting image of a figure depicted in religious paintings, some of 
the deeply religious residents became convinced that he was Jesus 
Christ and began showering him with gifts. McCartney saw no reason 
to correct them, and by the time the locals, tumbling to the truth, 
tarred and feathered him and ran him out of town on a rail, the Goat 
Man had an additional calling: as an itinerant preacher. McCartney, 
who eventually built a church near his school bus in Jeffersonville, 
admitted that his preaching was a gimmick but insisted it was sincere. 
Although his preaching, his wit, his tall tales, his goats and his 
seeming personification of the totally free life helped make him a 
beloved figure to many, to others his very strangeness seemed threatening 
and made him a target of mindless violence, most notably in 1968 in 
Signal Mountain, Tenn., near Chattanooga, when he was severely beaten 
by thugs who also slit the throats of eight of his goats. That was 
the end of his life as a goat man, but he continued to make occasional 
hitchhiking forays, including a trip while in his 80s that began when 
he became obsessed with the actress Morgan Fairchild and ended when 
he was mugged in Los Angeles. Although McCartney, who had lived in 
the nursing home for 11 years, spoke vaguely about having other children, 
he leaves no known survivors. His son, Albert Gene, who lived in the 
school bus in Jeffersonville, was murdered there earlier this year.
