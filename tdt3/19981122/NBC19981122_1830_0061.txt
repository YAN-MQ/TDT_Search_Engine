The growing dispute between Iraq and U.N. weapons inspectors intensified 
today. Iraq explained why it's refusing to hand over documents requested 
by chief weapons inspector Richard Butler. And Butler promptly fired 
back, saying Iraq's refusal is not acceptable. NBC's Ron Allen reports 
from Baghdad tonight. Today, Iraq stepped up its rhetoric in the documents 
dispute, refusing to hand over anything. Deputy prime minister Tariq 
Aziz. Completely dismissed chief weapons inspector Richard Butler's 
request. He has asked for alleged documents that do not exist. Then 
Iraq's foreign minister took the offensive with a bizarre chronicling 
of every document he claims his country has ever handed over. 1,760 
documents. 8,020 pages. He said they've released even more documents 
about Iraq's nuclear weapons program. I repeat, 1.5 million documents. 
Then the grand total and a Blunt conclusion. Around 2,188,020 documents. 
We have handed over, all, all available documents. Tonight, Richard 
Butler said he's still awaiting Iraq's official response to his request. 
These documents are truly important. They are not just bits of paper. 
They are a record that we need. But they're not the whole story. The 
whole story also involves us being able to complete serious inspections 
on the ground in Iraq. For UNSCOM, this was supposed to be the easy 
part, the inspectors have yet to try very many surprise visits, showing 
up at sensitive factories or presidential palaces unannounced. The 
inspectors worry Iraq now has the edge. And no one's willing to go 
to war over this. We're the ones in a box right now. The inspectors 
are back in continuing the game of hide-and-seek which the iraqis 
will ultimately win. Iraq certainly thinks so. Government-controlled 
newspapers also, condemning U.S. calls to topple saddam Hussein. Iraq 
now feels it has enough international support to take this hard line. 
The government is betting most of the world is growing impatient with 
inspections and what, after eight years now, at times seems like a 
Never-ending process. Ron Allen, NBC news, Baghdad.
