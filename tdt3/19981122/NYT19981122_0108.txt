The Rangers have completed their three-game California trip with a 
1-1-1 record and a hat trick of injuries. Before they finish their 
road swing with games in Buffalo on Wednesday and in Pittsburgh on 
Friday, they await the recovery of three regular players: Ulf Samuelsson, 
Jeff Beukeboom and Todd Harvey. Samuelsson, a rugged defenseman, played 
only six shifts in Saturday night's 2-2 tie with the Sharks before 
leaving the game with a groin pull. The Rangers said Sunday that Samuelsson 
will miss about one week. He tends to be a quick healer, but groin 
injuries can sometimes be stubborn. Beukeboom, another rugged defenseman, 
has not played since he was knocked unconscious by Matt Johnson's 
sucker punch in Thursday night's 5-1 victory over the Los Angeles 
Kings. Beukeboom is being tested to evaluate the mental effects of 
his concussion. It is unlikely that Beukeboom will play on Wednesday 
and the Rangers expect to summon a replacement from their Hartford 
farm team on Monday. Also Monday, Johnson goes to the National Hockey 
League offices for a disciplinary hearing that is likely to result 
in a long suspension. Harvey, a feisty right wing, missed Saturday 
night's game with a cut left elbow sustained against the Kings. He 
said the joint was swollen, stiff and sore, and he did not know when 
he would be healthy. The team's medical staff is hoping to avoid an 
infection. Harvey said he wants to play on Wednesday at Buffalo. Considering 
their injuries, their fatigue from three road games in four nights 
and the letdown they felt after giving up a 2-0 lead, the Rangers 
seemed relatively satisfied with their gritty effort in the tie with 
the Sharks. Goalie Dan Cloutier, starting his second consecutive game, 
faced 40 shots. Aleksei Kovalev and Marc Savard scored the goals. 
Sensing that the Rangers were weakened by the loss of three of their 
toughest players, the Sharks were more aggressive than they might 
have been. Adam Graves' nose was bloodied by a elbow. Kevin Stevens' 
face was cut by a high stick. Both plays resulted in penalties. Cloutier 
was bumped several times, one of them for a penalty in an overtime 
that saw both teams with great scoring chances but the Sharks with 
a 6-0 edge in shots on goal. ``Successful road trip,'' said Rangers 
coach John Muckler. ``It's .500. We missed a game in Anaheim we should 
have won. But we won one in L.A. and we tied here.'' Muckler was in 
a positive mood, twice calling the tie a ``win'' and stressing that, 
since opening the season with four consecutive defeats, the Rangers 
have lost only four of their last 15 games as they approach the quarter 
mark of the season. In that span, they have 5 victories and 6 ties. 
He offered praise for his young goalie, who was both good and lucky. 
``Cloutier was the best player on the ice,'' Muckler said. Cloutier 
said ``it was a pretty exciting game to be in'' and added that he 
tried not to lose his temper when the Sharks attempted to rattle him. 
As for putting Murray Craven in a headlock, Cloutier said: ``Part 
of the game.'' Asked about the possibility of playing more in place 
of the first-stringer Mike Richter, Cloutier said: ``Our coach has 
been around a long time. Whatever decision he makes, I'm going to 
respect and go with. Obviously I'm happy by the way I've played the 
last two games.'' Over all, Muckler said: ``Our team battled. That's 
the main thing. They battled hard. We never quit. You've got to be 
happy about that.'' It seems to be a characteristic of this rebuilding 
team in a transitional season under a veteran coach. Defenseman Mathieu 
Schneider said: ``It's a great trip to build momentum off of.'' Cloutier 
added: ``We're close as a team this year. We want to win for each 
other.'' When Samuelsson went down with an injury, Cloutier said, 
``We could easily have sat back.'' Instead, defenseman Geoff Smith 
played well in 20 minutes and Jan Mertzig contributed 15 minutes 10 
seconds. ``Those two guys just stood up and took advantage of their 
ice time,'' Cloutier said. ``Everybody wants to play here and, when 
they get a chance, they do well.'' The most ice time among the Ranger 
forwards went to John MacLean, the veteran right wing who leads the 
team in goals with seven. Although he had no points in 23:34, MacLean 
was effective in every zone and seemed to epitomize the professional 
integrity the team has developed. A Devil for most of his career, 
MacLean played much of last season with the Sharks before coming to 
the Rangers as a free agent. ``They came hard, but we persevered,'' 
said MacLean, who missed a practice earlier in the week with back 
spasms. ``It is a positive to get a big win the other night and getting 
a good tie here. Tiredness is a state of mind. You feed off each other. 
The guys are slowly starting to come together. You find that extra 
`oomph' to get over the hump and make things happen.''
