It can be one of life's most unpleasant tasks -- negotiating the price 
for a car. But there's a relatively inexpensive way around it. Valerie 
Morris reports. Karen tetreault bought this 1998 Mercury mountaineer 
for $28,900, more than $4,000 below its sticker price. It was a pleasure 
to buy a car, and I don't think you'll hear that from too many people, 
so -- Indeed, you won't. Karen let a service called car bargains do 
the dirty work -- haggling with dealers for the best price. It takes 
a long time to get through all that. A long negotiating dance. And 
it's a dance that the dealer can dance a lot better than you can. 
First, you select the model and specifications. Then for $165, the 
nonprofit car bargains solicits bids from at least five dealers in 
your area. What can you guys offer as your most competitive markup 
from invoice on one of those units? Savings range from $1,000 over 
invoice for a car such as the volkswagen passat V-6 to $1,500 below 
invoice on a Lincoln town car signature. They in essence do the give 
and take, do the haggling for the customer. Come up with a price. 
Present you a series of bids on the automobile that you're interested 
in. Services such as "consumer reports" will tell you dealer cost 
information for $12 a model, but it's up to you to find and cut your 
best deal. Car bargains, though, is independent and works with local 
dealers nationwide. Car bargains can be reached on the web at -- that's 
"your money." Valerie Morris, "CNN Financial News," New York.
