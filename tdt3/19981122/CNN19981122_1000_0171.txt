The United States and Iraq are still squabbling over documents. The 
U.S. says Iraq is being unreasonable in refusing to hand over requested 
papers to U.N. weapons inspectors. Iraq argues some of the documents 
do not exist. Ben Wedeman reports. The band was out of tune, but Iraqi 
deputy prime minister Tariq aziz, attending an Arab solidarity meeting, 
didn't miss a beat blasting chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler's 
persistent demands for Iraqi documents relating to Baghdad's program 
to produce weapons of mass destruction. Why is Butler doing that? 
He is either creating a superficial pretext to justify the American 
aggression, or he's trying to undermine the comprehensive review. 
Iraq wants the U.N. security council to conduct a review of its compliance 
with U.N. resolutions, a review they hope will lead to the lifting 
of sanctions. But the United States says there will be no review until 
Iraq proves its willingness to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors. 
Leaving the meeting, Aziz told reporters in Arabic that Butler is 
a tool used to provoke and create crises, accusing him of playing 
a dishonorable and unprofessional role. On Saturday, the inspectors 
conducted what Iraqi officials are calling a Surprise inspection, 
but U.N. sources say their activities have been routine. The inspection 
was unannounced, but their inspections are always unannounced. Tariq 
Aziz took time off over the weekend to accept, on behalf of Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein, the man of the century prize from the indo-Iraqi 
friendship society. The prize's recipient has yet to comment on the 
controversial documents. On Saturday, he met with an Algerian envoy, 
who conveyed a message of support for Iraq. While the special weapons 
commission is pressing for the documents, Iraq wants the United Nations 
security council to begin the comprehensive review. Neither side appears 
willing to compromise. Both sides seem to be losing patience. Ben 
Wedeman, CNN, Baghdad.
