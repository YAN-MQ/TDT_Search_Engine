The chief of an ethnic Albanian negotiating team on Sunday blasted 
a Serb proposal for the strife-torn Kosovo province as a blueprint 
for cementing Serbian domination in Kosovo, the Beta news agency reported. 
Fehmi Agani said the only option acceptable to Kosovo's Albanians 
was the U.S.-drafted plan seeking to end the crisis through shuttle 
diplomacy by American mediator Christopher Hill. Ethnic Albanians 
comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 2 million. Serbian authorities 
published Saturday their proposal to give Kosovo a form of self-rule 
but keep it within Serbia. ``A paper legalizing an imposed state in 
Kosovo, a state of Serbian domination over (ethnic) Albanians, cannot 
be a subject of negotiations,'' the news agency quoted Agani as saying. 
Agani belongs to the moderate, Western-backed ethnic Albanian leadership 
that advocates peaceful measures to solving Kosovo's crisis. He reiterated 
Sunday that ethnic Albanians would be ready to accept an interim solution 
by which Kosovo would remain within Yugoslavia _ on equal status with 
Serbia and Montenegro, the two Yugoslav republics _ for three to five 
years. After that a referendum would decide the province's future 
status. Kosovo is now a Serbian province. Several hundred people have 
been killed and almost a quarter of a million ethnic Albanians displaced 
from their homes since Serbia launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists 
in February. The bloodshed abated _ but has not fully ended _ since 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic signed a de-facto peace agreement 
last month, under threat of NATO attack Serbian president Milan Milutinovic, 
who last week rejected a U.S.-sponsored draft, scheduled new talks 
with ethnic Albanian leaders for Wednesday in the provincial capital 
of Pristina. It was a hollow gesture since Kosovo Albanians didn't 
show up for previous talks. ``We shall avoid ... silly games played 
(by those) allegedly ready for a dialogue on Kosovo,'' Agani said 
Sunday, dismissing Milutinovic's invitation. The ethnic Albanians 
seek foreign mediation of talks with Serbia, something Serbia opposes.
