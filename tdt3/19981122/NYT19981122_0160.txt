Edwige Feuillere, a much-loved French actress whose 60-year career 
took her from sensual screen beauty to grande dame of the Paris theater, 
died here on Nov. 13. She was 91 and lived in Paris. She was buried 
on Wednesday in a family tomb at Beaugency, near Orleans. Ms. Feuillere 
first gained renown in 1935 when, shockingly for the time, she briefly 
appeared naked in Abel Gance's film ``Lucrece Borgia.'' And it was 
as a femme fatale that she achieved her greatest stage triumph, playing 
opposite Jean-Louis Barrault in Paul Claudel's ``Partage de Midi'' 
in 1947. But she was also frequently acclaimed for her interpretation 
of classical roles. ``Edwige Feuillere was our Marlene Dietrich, our 
Irene Dunne and our Greta Garbo, all in one,'' Le Monde wrote after 
her death. She retired from the stage only six years ago after a final 
production in which she read from her best-known roles. ``Now people 
can only see me as a very old person who had a mythical life,'' she 
said in a recent interview with a French writer. ``Ah, if only you 
had seen her when she was.'' She continued: ``Well, I'd like people 
to remember me for my best moment. But it could be when I was 25 or 
50 or 70 or in my very last show.'' Her death, which prompted a wave 
of tributes from French political and cultural figures, came less 
than one week after that of Jean Marais, the handsome, swashbuckling 
French actor who played opposite Ms. Feuillere in Jean Cocteau's 1947 
film ``L'Aigle a Deux Tetes.'' Cocteau had created the role for her, 
and she first created it onstage. Stunningly beautiful in her youth, 
gracefully elegant in old age, Ms. Feuillere was remembered as much 
for her powerful well-modulated voice as for her expressive eyes and 
magnetic presence. Yet for all her popularity, she showed little interest 
in a glamorous lifestyle. Modest and humorous in private, she was 
also self-deprecating about her talent in her 1977 autobiography, 
``Les Feux de la Memoire.'' Ms. Feuillere was born Edwige Caroline 
Cunati on Oct. 29, 1907, in the town of Vesoul in eastern France. 
Her mother's family, originally from Alsace, had moved back to France 
after Germany occupied the region in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. 
Her father was Italian and, because he was drafted by the Italian 
army in World War I, Edwige spent much of her childhood in Italy. 
After the war, the family moved to Dijon in France where she showed 
interest in the theater by acting in school plays. In 1928 she began 
attending the Paris Conservatory of Dramatic Arts, and two years later 
she married a fellow student, Pierre Feuillere, although the marriage 
soon floundered because of his drug problems. Ms. Feuillere's career 
_ she first used the stage name of Cora Lynn before taking her husband's 
name _ began slowly with small parts in several mediocre films, although 
she is remembered for her lead role in the film version of Marcel 
Pagnol's play ``Topaze.'' She also found work in the theater and was 
invited to join the Comedie Francaise, but she left after two years, 
complaining that she was being overlooked for major roles. In 1939, 
she was cast as Marguerite Gautier in Alexandre Dumas' play ``La Dame 
aux Camelias,'' and she at last won recognition as a serious stage 
actor. At the time, the play's director, Jacques Hebertot, predicted, 
``You will carry this role throughout your life, a slave to the success 
it will bring you.'' And he was right: She appeared in frequent revivals 
_ in France and Britain _ for the next two decades. During Germany's 
occupation of France in World War II, Ms. Feuillere worked in the 
theater (she helped discover Gerard Philipe in Jean Giraudoux's ``Sodome 
et Gomorrhe'') and in films (notably in Jacques de Baroncelli's 1941 
``Duchesse de Langeais''). After the war, she appeared in 200 performances 
of ``L'Aigle a Deux Tetes'' before taking on another major role, which 
she would also perform again and again, as Yse in ``Partage de Midi.'' 
When she appeared in the role in London in 1968, the British theater 
critic Harold Hobson described her as the greatest actress he had 
ever seen. Although she played an old woman in Patrice Chereau's 1974 
film ``La Chair de l'Orchide,'' she virtually abandoned the cinema 
after 1960. But she remained a pillar of the French theater, occasionally 
appearing onstage with her old movie partner Jean Marais, seven years 
her junior. In 1965, she created the lead role in Giraudoux's ``Madwoman 
of Chaillot'' and returned to the play on several subsequent occasions. 
Ms. Feuillere had no immediate survivors. She first announced her 
retirement in 1984, but promptly changed her mind and appeared frequently 
onstage throughout the 1980s. Finally, on the eve of her 85th birthday, 
she did retire. ``I have died so many times onstage,'' she said recently. 
``My own will arrive one day, probably sooner than I expect.''
