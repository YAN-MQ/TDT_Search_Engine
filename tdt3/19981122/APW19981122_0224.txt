Mike Skinner took the lead on the 140th of 201 laps, outdueled Jeff 
Gordon in the final corner and won by 0.153 seconds Sunday, his second 
straight NASCAR exhibition race victory in Japan. The 41-year-old 
resident of Susansville, California, posted an unofficial time of 
2 hours, 45 minutes, 58.000 seconds, or 112.558 mph (180.09 kph) in 
his Monte Carlo Chevrolet. Organizers, unable to provide official 
times because of computer problems, gave only Skinner's winning margin 
over Gordon, who also drove a Chevrolet. Jeremy Mayfield was third 
in a Taurus Ford. The NASCAR Thunder Special Coca-Cola 500 was the 
third and last race in a three-year series held under a contract with 
Japanese organizers to promote the sport worldwide. Rusty Wallace 
won the event in 1996 at the 1.54-mile (2.46-kilometer) Suzuka Circuitland 
road course, and Skinner triumphed last year, also at Suzuka. The 
victory Sunday was worth dlrs 134,045 from a purse of dlrs 1 million. 
Skinner started from the third position, behind Mayfield and Gordon, 
and made his charge on the 140th lap around the 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) 
Motegi Twin Ring oval track. He kept the lead to the end. ``Our car 
was very, very good. When we put tires on it, it would just go,'' 
said Skinner. ``I probably cool my tires down more than anybody else. 
Our car on hot tires would push very, very bad.'' He added that Gordon 
was better over short runs along the course, while his car did better 
on the long runs. ``We knew we had to stop at the corners ... and 
just go really slow getting in there and really slow in coming out 
just like in the road race at Suzuka,'' Skinner said. Last year, Skinner 
was the Winston Cup's 40-year-old rookie of the year when he drove 
to his first victory in high-level competition at Suzuka. In Sunday's 
race, Gordon, of Pittsboro, Indiana, was seeking his 14th victory 
of the season. At age 27, he was the youngest driver to win three 
Winston Cup championships. Mayfield, from Owensboro, Kentucky, won 
his only Winston Cup title in the Pocono 500 at Long Pond, Pennsylvania, 
in June. The field of 31 included 13 Winston Cup stars, 11 Winston 
Cup West competitors, four Japanese, two Busch Grand drivers and one 
from the Craftsman Truck Series. Bill France, president of NASCAR, 
said at the opening ceremony that said the race will continue in the 
future. ``I'm very pleased to announce that we'll return again in 
1999 with our stock cars and hope that you'll be here to join us once 
again,'' he said. Japanese racing officials said details have yet 
to be worked out for the Winston Cup West to have a race of its championship 
series staged in Japan.
