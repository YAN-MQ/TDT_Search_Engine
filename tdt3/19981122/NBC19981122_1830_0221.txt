At the same time, a renewed effort is under way to undermine Saddam 
hussein, who has ruled Iraq since 1979. With the promise of western 
support, Iraqi opposition groups are meeting tomorrow in London. More 
on this from NBC's Keith Miller. In the many restaurants, shops and 
offices run by exiled Iraqi's, saddam Hussein is known as the Bully 
of Baghdad. I don't think any Iraqi person, whether they're inside 
Iraq or outside iraq, is happy about what's going on. London is the 
base for more than a dozen Iraqi opposition groups. British officials 
for the first time will bring them together tomorrow. And what we'll 
be seeking at the meeting on Monday is to look for ways in which we 
can develop that cooperation. But so far, the opposition has failed 
to undermine Saddam's regime, and his image is everywhere. During 
commercial breaks on television. 50 full-time artists are employed 
to paint his portrait. He has created around him a complete personality 
cult, the extent to which he has the country under his total control. 
I think he is virtually impregnable. There have been assassination 
attempts on Saddam's son, uday. But officials say Saddam rarely leaves 
himself vulnerable to attack. Short of Saddam slipping on a bar of 
soap in the bathroom and hitting his head on the side of the bathtub 
and getting a brain hemorrhage, I don't see any chance of the world 
getting rid of Saddam. Opposition groups will be receiving $97 million 
from the U.S. government to be used for military equipment and propaganda. 
Still, the groups opposed to Saddam are fragmented, and seven years 
after the gulf war, no closer to realizing their goal of freeing Iraq 
from saddam. Keith Miller, NBC news, London.
