For the second consecutive week, the top-ranked team in women's basketball 
lost in stunning fashion. Regan Freuen's free throw with one second 
to go gave Stanford (1-3) a 73-72 upset over top-ranked Purdue at 
Maples Pavilion. Purdue (2-1), which had attained its first No. 1 
ranking after snapping Tennessee's 46-game winning streak last Sunday, 
had trailed all game before tying the score on a driving layup by 
sophomore guard Katie Douglas with 18 seconds to go. On the next possession, 
Stanford worked the clock down until junior guard Milena Flores zipped 
a pass to Freuen inside. Freuen, a senior guard who finished with 
10 points, missed her first shot but was fouled by Douglas on the 
rebound. After making the first free throw, she intentionally missed 
the second to run out the clock and send the crowd of 4,553 into a 
frenzy. ``I'm really proud of our team's effort,'' said Stanford Coach 
Tara VanDerveer, whose team entered the weekend unranked for the first 
time since the beginning of the 1987-88 season. ``We hit big shots 
when we needed them. It's a great win for our team, especially with 
the senior hitting the free throw.'' Lindsey Yamasaki, a freshman 
guard, led four Stanford players in double figures with 18 points 
to go along with nine rebounds. The junior guard Christina Batastini 
came off the bench to contribute a career-high 14 points. Stanford's 
sophomore center Carolyn Moos, who had 16 points and three assists, 
got the better of her Purdue counterpart, Camille Cooper. Cooper, 
who scored a career-high 18 points in the upset of Tennessee, was 
held to eight points and no rebounds. Stanford took control from the 
start, leading by 21-8 with 10 minutes 53 seconds left in the first 
half. Purdue shot only 34 percent from the floor in the first half, 
while the Cardinals used good ball movement and a balanced offense 
to take a 35-28 halftime lead. After trailing by 67-59 with 4:27 to 
play, Purdue made its run. Douglas scored nine points in the final 
four minutes to help Purdue tie the score before Freuen and the Cardinal 
pulled out the victory. ``They just came out with a great level of 
intensity,'' said Purdue Coach Carolyn Peck. ``The pivotal part of 
the game was the level of intensity that Stanford came in versus what 
we started the game with.''
