House republicans appear to be heading in two directions simultaneously. 
Republicans on the Judiciary committee look prepared to push for president 
clinton's impeachment. At the same time, sources say house speaker-designate 
Bob Livingston wants mr. Clinton's fate settled quickly, preferably 
by the end of the year. Livingston says Congress has more pressing 
matters. We have ultimately cut taxes, cut spending and balanced the 
budget. And we've got a surplus. So I think we're heading in the right 
direction. What I'm telling you is we are gonna protect the social 
security trust fund and we're gonna have a tax cut. Congressional 
democrats agree with Livingston that the impeachment question should 
be settled by the end of the year.
