That's "Nightly News" this Sunday. Here is stone Phillips with a look 
at what's coming up on "Dateline." Thanks, A . A freak accident at 
the Macy's Thanksgiving day parade nearly kills a young mother. Could 
she rebuild her shattered body and life? I just didn't know. I thought 
life was over. Things have changed. I'll never be the same as I was. 
A "dateline survivors story," tonight. ann? Thanks, stone. Tom Brokaw 
will be here tomorrow night. I'm A Curry. Thank you for joining us. 
I'll see you tomorrow morning on "today." Stay tuned. The Sunday edition 
of "Dateline" NBC is next.
