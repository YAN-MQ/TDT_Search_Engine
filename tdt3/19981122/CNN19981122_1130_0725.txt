Federal regulators reportedly want to lower the maximum height for 
headlights on large vehicles because of safety concerns. "The New

high-mounted headlights are making visibility on the road more difficult 
for other drivers. Regulators say the headlights can create so much 
glare they appear as high beams to oncoming drivers.
