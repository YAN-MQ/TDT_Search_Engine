Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." The green bay Packers' three-year 
reign as NFC central champions will likely come to an end if they 
lose to Minnesota today in Minneapolis. The Vikings have a two-game 
edge in the standings, and they have Randall cunningham, the man who 
threw for 442 yards and four TDs at green bay in week five. You know, 
if superman was black, he'd be this guy. If you see him on film, he's 
doing some unbelievable things. This might be our last chance to win 
a division. We've done it for three straight years. This is the best 
Viking team I have seen in my eight years of pro football. Green bay 
at Minnesota, one of eight early games today. Same division, Detroit 
the stam pa bay. 8-2 Atlanta might not have Jamal Anderson today. 
He's nursing a bad foot. Indy at Buffalo. Big game in the AFC central, 
Jacksonville at Pittsburgh. Philly at the giants. Seattle in Dallas. 
All other games are late starts.
