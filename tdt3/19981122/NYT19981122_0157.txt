It was an impressive victory, and for Laura Davies it was a relief. 
Ending a 20-month victory drought on the LPGA tour, Davies, who led 
from wire to wire, captured the PageNet Tour Championship on Sunday 
by four strokes over Brandie Burton, Pat Hurst and Karrie Webb at 
the Desert Inn Golf Club. Shooting a 3-under-par 69, Davies finished 
at 11-under 277 for the tournament. One of the world's top players 
for most of this decade, Davies has been plagued by putting problems 
for 18 months. After Saturday's round of 75, which included 38 putts, 
Davies wondered whether she had the confidence to finish the job. 
But instead of folding, Davies flourished. Starting the day with a 
2-stroke advantage over Meg Mallon, Davies never lost the lead. And 
when Hurst, who shot a 70, pulled within one stroke, Davies answered 
with a key birdie at the par-5, 471-yard No. 10. From that point, 
Davies never led by fewer than two strokes. And after ending the tournament 
in style, making a 6-foot putt for birdie on the final hole, she finally 
smiled for one of the few times all day. Asked why she had not smiled 
earlier, Davies gave one of her typically candid answers. ``You don't 
want to walk around all day with an idiot's grin on your face,'' said 
Davies, a 35-year-old native of England. ``I didn't want to smile. 
I wanted to win. I've never been so nervous. This is the hardest I've 
ever fought for a victory.'' Sunday's other big winner was Annika 
Sorenstam, who finished the year with a scoring average of 69.99, 
becoming the first LPGA player to end the year with a scoring average 
of less than 70. Sorenstam needed a 72 on Sunday for the record, and 
that was exactly what she shot, finishing at even-par 288 for the 
tournament. As a result, Sorenstam swept the top three LPGA awards 
for the year: the money title ($1,092,748), the player of the year 
award and the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average. Sorenstam also 
captured those honors in 1995, but she was particularly pleased with 
Sunday's performance because she was admittedly nervous on the back 
nine after a bogey at No. 12 left her at 2 over par. But Sorenstam 
birdied No. 13 and then made a crucial eagle on the par-5 No. 15, 
hitting a beautiful 7-wood shot from 215 yards that landed 12 feet 
from the cup, followed by a solid putt. After consecutive pars, Sorenstam 
reached the 18th tee knowing that all she needed was a bogey or better 
for the scoring record. She reached the green in two shots, left a 
25-foot putt 5 feet short and missed the putt for par, but tapped 
in for bogey. The record belonged to Sorenstam, who has lowered her 
scoring in each of her five seasons on tour. And at age 28, with three 
money titles already, the best for Sorenstam may be yet to come. ``I 
had a burden on my shoulders that I really wanted to achieve,'' Sorenstam 
said of the record. ``It has been a tough week in that sense. Now 
that it's over, it's a dream come true. It's going to be tougher to 
keep lowering my average, but my goal is always to improve.'' For 
Davies, her performance on the par-5 holes was the key to victory. 
The LPGA's longest hitter, Davies shot a cumulative 12 under par on 
those holes for the tournament, including three eagles, and reached 
most of the par-5 greens in two shots. Davies used length off the 
tee and accuracy with her approach shots to take pressure off her 
putter. Burton, Dale Eggeling and Betsy King had Sunday's best rounds, 
at 67, while Webb also made a charge with a 68. But it was too late 
to catch Davies, who built her lead by shooting a 66 on Thursday, 
followed by a 67 on Friday. By winning the season-ending tournament, 
which featured the tour's top 30 money winners, Davies gave herself 
a confidence boost for 1999 and ended the year No. 11 on the money 
list. ``When you go months without winning and you're supposedly one 
of the top players in the world, you wonder if you'll ever win again,'' 
Davies said. ``That's a slump. I was almost afraid to think about 
winning today. Maybe this is a springboard. Maybe now I can stop whining 
about my putting and realize that if I play solid golf, I can win.'' 
Davies used a new putter this week, but when asked how long she would 
keep it, Davies said, ``Maybe a week.'' But the memories of victory 
would last a lot longer. Davies enjoys gambling, but she will remember 
this trip to Las Vegas for the golf. ``I love to gamble, but I never 
win,'' Davies said. ``This is the first time I've left Las Vegas a 
winner.'' CHIP SHOTS The tour championship ended the official LPGA 
season. The top five money winners were ANNIKA SORENSTAM ($1,092,748), 
SE RI PAK ($872,170), DONNA ANDREWS ($715,428), KARRIE WEBB ($704,477) 
and LISELOTTE NEUMANN ($665,069). ... MEG MALLON, who began the day 
in second place, shot a 75 and finished 10th.
