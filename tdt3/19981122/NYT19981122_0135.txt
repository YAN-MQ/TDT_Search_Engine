The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23: The temptation, 
when considering a pay raise for New York's state Legislature, is 
to ask, ``What for?'' Many legislators would have trouble making a 
case that they deserve more pay for their dronelike performance at 
these part-time jobs. That may be why they waited like poltroons until 
after the election to announce plans to give themselves more of the 
taxpayers' money. Nevertheless, if we hope to entice decent public 
servants in the future, we need to start offering a better pay package 
now. In recent days, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan 
Democrat, has been vigorously pitching for the first pay increase 
in 12 years. So far, the wishes of his Republican colleagues _ the 
Senate's majority leader, Joseph Bruno, and, more important, Gov. 
George Pataki _ have not surfaced. One hint circling in Albany is 
that the governor would agree to raises if the Legislature would adopt 
his version of charter schools. We would prefer a different deal that 
touched more directly on the Legislature's performance. In exchange 
for more pay, the legislators should accelerate opening their arcane 
system to greater participation by rank-and-file legislators and broader 
public scrutiny, a trend that started earlier this year with the state 
budget process. For legislators to move in lock step with the leadership 
may sound efficient, but over the years, it has probably done more 
harm than good. To this end, pay raises should not include the stipends 
parceled out by the leadership to members for jobs ranging from committee 
chairman to assistant whip. All but about 33 of the 211 members of 
the Legislature receive these ``leadership'' stipends, a policy that 
certainly discourages dissent and independence. A legislator's base 
pay is now $57,500, with add-ons from $6,500 to $30,000. Legislators 
are quietly talking about a raise in base pay to at least $78,000 
a year plus the stipends. A better policy would be to raise the salary 
but drop the extras. The legislators should also go for genuine campaign 
finance reform that would stop slush funds for the political parties, 
limit contributions and start allotting public funds for candidates. 
One public service would be to ban the particularly slimy Albany tradition 
of holding fund-raising receptions while the Legislature is in session. 
Finally, no legislative pay package can pass without addressing judicial 
salaries. The governor and legislators should make certain they agree 
to increases to $136,700 for a state Supreme Court justice and other 
increases as recommended by a state commission, approved by the Court 
of Appeals and endorsed by Chief Judge Judith Kaye.
