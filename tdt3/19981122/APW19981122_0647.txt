Justin Rose bogeyed three of the last four holes for a 74 in European 
Tour qualifying Sunday and now needs something like a 69 por 70 in 
Monday's final round if he is to win his card next season. Star of 
this year's British Open, when, as an amateur, he tied for fourth, 
18-year-old Rose has failed to earn a single penny as a pro, missing 
the cut all eight times. In the six-round qualifying competition, 
Rose has improved steadily from 131st to 58th and Sunday's round, 
which finished bogey, bogey, bogey, birdie, moved him up to 51st with 
a 6-over, five round total of 366. But he needs to improve again Sunday 
to be among the 35 and ties to earn a card. ``I like to keep everyone 
in suspense,'' the teen-ager said after his 74. Rose is 17 strokes 
behind Sweden's Henrik Nystrom, who took over at the top of the leaderboard 
from Scotland's Ross Drummond by scoring a 68 and now is four strokes 
ahead of the field on 349. Drummond carded a 74 and is tied for second 
with Italy's Marcello Santi, whose 69 gave him a total of 353.
