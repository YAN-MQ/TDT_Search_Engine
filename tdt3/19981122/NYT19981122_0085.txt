Alan J. Pakula's career was notably overlooked by the book ``Easy 
Riders, Raging Bulls,'' Peter Biskind's warts-and-all look at filmmaking 
in the 1970s. Pakula was one of that decade's most eminent directors, 
but he wasn't part of the wild bunch. His style was more thoughtful, 
efficient and adult than that of his more flagrantly experimental 
colleagues, and it wound up having more staying power than most. For 
nearly 40 years, as both producer (``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' ``Inside 
Daisy Clover'') and director (from ``The Sterile Cuckoo'' in 1969 
to ``The Devil's Own'' last year), he survived devastating changes 
in the film industry with his dignity and intelligence intact. That 
was no easy feat. The atmosphere that fostered his so-called Paranoid 
Trilogy (``Klute,'' ``The Parallax View'' and ``All the President's 
Men'') allowed for quiet moments, subtle plotting and an air of profound 
anxiety that have all but vanished from today's more breathless thrillers. 
Yet when Pakula died in traffic on Thursday, at 70, in just the kind 
of violent incident that his filmmaking never exploited, he was still 
tackling the sophisticated material that had always appealed to him. 
Pakula was at work on ``No Ordinary Time,'' based on Doris Kearns 
Goodwin's book about Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. ``Here he was, 
doing a project that was so personal to him, that was a period piece, 
that was obviously going to be costly,'' said Harry Clein, Pakula's 
longtime publicity agent and friend. ``His heart was there. It was 
about politics, about American royalty in a sense, about emotions 
and events that are almost Shakespearean.'' Clein added, pointing 
out the all too obvious, ``That's not the marketplace today.'' Pakula's 
adaptability depended on what had always been great professional strengths: 
a respect for audiences, a knack for finding depth in potentially 
potboiling material (like the thriller ``Klute'') and a special flair 
for encouraging actors to shine. If he was known for creative ambivalence 
during filmmaking (he often suggested more than one method of envisioning 
a scene), he was just as certain to find precisely the right moments 
to assemble at editing time. Actors in his films had a way of baring 
their souls without breast-beating, and he could capture them at their 
most intimate and appealing. From Warren Beatty in ``The Parallax 
View'' to Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford in ``All the President's 
Men'' to Brad Pitt, who was at his most personable in ``The Devil's 
Own,'' performers flourished in the intriguing, multidimensional realm 
of Pakula's work. His brand of knowing understatement was as much 
at home in comedy as it was in more mystery-laden material. In ``Starting 
Over,'' his 1979 film about a newly divorced man (written by James 
L. Brooks, who was right on Pakula's wavelength), Frances Sternhagen 
plays the eagerly sympathetic sister-in-law of Burt Reynolds' central 
character and exclaims, ``Call if you get sad!'' as he leaves her. 
``Can I call if I get happy?'' he asks ruefully, knowing what the 
answer will be. ``Yeah. Sure,'' she answers, with obvious disappointment. 
Just as he knew how to get under the skin of a lonely New York call 
girl (in ``Klute'') or a haunted World War II refugee (``Sophie's 
Choice''), Pakula knew that a lonely man could spoil others' fun just 
by becoming less lonely. The very simplicity with which his best films 
unfolded was often indicative of Pakula's intense attention to detail. 
For the Washington Post newsroom in ``All the President's Men,'' he 
said in notes for a planned book about making that film, he wanted 
``that hard, hard ruthless white and that low ceiling made up of endless 
fluorescent light.'' He continued: ``It's a world without shadows; 
isn't that terrific for a newspaper world, for a world that exposes 
hypocrisies and reveals truths? Nothing can remain in the shadows 
there. I want that exaggerated. I want that emphasized. I want a world 
with great depth of vision, because the film has to do with people 
looking and perceiving.'' In the same spirit, he chose shadowy garages 
as backdrops for the film's most secretive figures, the Watergate 
burglars and Deep Throat. ``They should be elusive visually,'' he 
said. ``It's a total contrast.'' By the '90s, when adapting best-selling 
thrillers like ``Presumed Innocent'' and ``The Pelican Brief,'' Pakula 
could still create such nuances even when his material was more matter-of-fact. 
Though he had become a virtual dinosaur in the eyes of younger studio 
executives, he had the professional durability and personal charm 
to keep them as interested in his future as in the triumphs of his 
past. And through it all, he seems to have kept his perspective as 
sharp as his hauntingly intuitive directorial gifts. Pakula never 
forgot that when he took part in a press junket to promote ``Klute,'' 
nobody asked him anything about a film that would later be deemed 
one of his very best. (``He just sat in his hotel room,'' Clein recalled.) 
He knew how easily tastes changed in Hollywood. He knew how to tell 
stories and touch nerves. And he knew how to stay above the fray.
