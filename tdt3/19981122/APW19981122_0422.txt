Albanians trickled into polling booths amid apparent calm Sunday, 
in a controversial referendum meant to give Europe's poorest country 
its first post-communist constitution. Foreign election observers 
and national media reported no referendum-related violence in this 
Balkan nation where past elections have been marked by gunfire and 
intimidation. Albania's powerful opposition Democratic Party has urged 
a boycott of the vote, saying that low turnout would show the lack 
of support for the draft constitution that would outline basic rights. 
Albania shed Europe's most isolated communist dictatorship in 1991. 
The draft would give citizens of this Balkan nation the right to legally 
change their religion and to identify themselves as members of an 
ethnic minority. It would also define property rights and allow the 
government to expropriate land deemed of national interest. Opposition 
leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and predict many people 
will turn away from Islam, the dominant religion, to avoid discrimination 
while in richer, non-Muslim neighbors such as Greece. They also say 
the expropriation clause smacks of communism. The draft constitution 
is seen as likely to pass. ``I voted yes because we at least have 
to be optimistic,'' said Hasan Malolli, a 56-year-old teacher who 
voted in a Tirana suburb. ``Hope is the only thing that we can really 
do.'' Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, the chief opposition politician 
who played a key role in ant-government unrest earlier this year, 
claimed Sunday morning that turnout will be so low the draft will 
be ``a dead body.'' Albania's Central Voting Commission said about 
35 percent of the nearly 2 million eligible voters had cast their 
ballots by midday, despite snow that closed four roads in northern 
Albania and slowed, or halted voting in some areas. Violence has accompanied 
national elections in the past as separate factions squared off outside 
polling booths. But the boycott kept most opposition supporters away 
from the booths Sunday. Daan Everts, the head of the mission to Albania 
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said before 
the voting that a turnout of 40 percent to 50 percent would likely 
be seen as reasonable, given the boycott. He said turnout below 30 
percent or so could call the results into question. Prime Minister 
Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor Tirana suburb, said 
the constitution will help boost prosperity in Europe's poorest nation. 
``I came from my apartment where there was no electricity and walked 
on an unpaved road like all Albanians _ looking reality in the eye,'' 
said Majko, as electricity failed in his polling station as well. 
``I voted for the future.'' Army sharpshooters surveyed his polling 
booth from the roofs of nearby apartment buildings and motorcycle 
police throughout Tirana searched cars with license plates from outside 
of Tirana. Other than a heavier police presence, Tirana streets showed 
no signs of tensions as residents perused street vendors' wares or 
sipped coffee on sidewalk tables. Small pockets of voters gathered 
in front of the schools and post offices used as polling booths but 
no lengthy lineups were visible. Fearing low turnout, the government 
recently scrapped a law requiring a referendum to be voted on by more 
than 50 percent of eligible voters.
