House republicans seem to be heading in two directions simultaneously. 
Those on the Judiciary committee look prepared to push for president 
clinton's impeachment. Meanwhile, sources say house speaker-designate 
Bob Livingston wants Mr. clinton's fate settled quickly, preferably 
by the end of the year, before livingston takes office. Livingston 
says he wants to focus on cutting taxes and saving social security 
and says he thinks he can get the new Congress on the right track. 
I became convinced that Newt Gingrich could not hold onto the speakership 
for the next few days or the next few months. When I came to that 
conclusion, I'd ask myself who could best succeed him, and after talking 
to a lot of people, I figured I could, and I could run the house and 
get the machinery working, that I could remedy some of the problems 
that we had in confusing our message, not getting our message out. 
Congressional democrats agree with Livingston that the impeachment 
question should be settled by the end of the year.
