Kids rule! "The rugrats movie" beat out "enemy of the state" to take 
the number one spot at the box office this weekend. Anna Hovind reports, 
you may recognize one of the voices behind the animation. Hang on 
to your diapers, baby. We're going in. That's Tommy pickles. He's 
the bravest baby I've ef ever known. I'm chuckie. I got Tommy. In 
the new film, "the rugrats movie," we learn a deep dark secret. Chuckie's 
a chick. Well, not the character, but the voice of chuckie, Christine 
cavanaugh. Hello, how are you doing, CNN? He has aned a noid problem. 
The film is based on the number one children's program on TV. It's 
about a group of toddlers who can talk among themselves, and always 
seem to be getting into mischief of one kind or another. We're doomed! 
Doomed, I tell you. Cavanaugh's voice may sound familiar. She not 
only does chuckie on "the rugrats," but voices on many other TV shows 
and movies, including the original "babe," the pig. Get out of here, 
you big butt-heads. I'm an actress. I'm a theater actress. Voiceovers 
was a fluke for me because I have a girlfriend who is an animator 
and she was making a master's degree film at UCLA. She hired me to 
do a voiceover. She didn't actually pay me. When it comes time to 
become chuckie, she reverts back to her childhood. You're in the room 
and everybody's interacting. We have a good time together and joke 
around as kids. It's kind of a freedom to be kid. Be spontaneous. 
a sequel to the film is already on the drawing board. I guess we'll 
have to change highs diaper. What do you mean we? Anna Hovind, CNN, 
reporting.
