The chief of an ethnic Albanian negotiating team on Sunday blasted 
a Serb proposal for the strife-torn province as a blueprint for cementing 
Serbian domination in Kosovo, the Beta news agency reported. Fehmi 
Agani said the only option acceptable to Kosovo's Albanians was the 
U.S.-drafted plan seeking to end the crisis through shuttle diplomacy 
carried out by American mediator for Kosovo Christopher Hill. Serbian 
authorities published Saturday their own four-page draft proposal 
which gives the Albanian-majority province a form of self-rule but 
keeps it within Serbia, its constitution and legal framework. ``A 
paper legalizing an imposed state in Kosovo, a state of Serbian domination 
over (ethnic) Albanians, cannot be a subject of negotiations,'' Agani 
was quoted as saying in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, where he attended 
a weekend conference by the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in 
Serbia. Agani belongs to the moderate, Western-backed ethnic Albanian 
leadership which advocates peaceful measures to solving Kosovo's crisis. 
He reiterated Sunday that ethnic Albanians would be ready to accept 
an interim solution by which Kosovo would remain within Yugoslavia 
_ on equal status with Serbia and Montenegro, the two Yugoslav republics 
_ for three to five years, after which a referendum would decide the 
province's future status. Kosovo is now a Serbian province. Serbian 
president Milan Milutinovic, who last week rejected a U.S.-sponsored 
draft, scheduled new talks with ethnic Albanian leaders for Wednesday 
in provincial capital Pristina _ a hollow gesture since Kosovo Albanians 
didn't show up for previous talks. ``We shall avoid ... silly games 
played (by those) allegedly ready for a dialogue on Kosovo,'' Agani 
said Sunday, dismissing Milutinovic's invitation. The Albanians seek 
foreign mediation of talks with Serbia, something Serbia opposes. 
Several hundred people have been killed and almost a quarter of a 
million ethnic Albanians displaced from their homes since Serbia launched 
a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in February. The bloodshed abated 
_ but has not fully ended _ since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
signed a de-facto peace agreement last month, under threat of NATO 
attack Ethnic Albanians ``are paying a high price for their right 
to self-determination,'' Agani said. ``A fifth of Kosovo has been 
burnt to the ground, hundreds have been killed, hundreds of thousands 
have become refugees.'' ``That's the toll for this year alone _ we 
have no way of knowing what the toll will be next year, if a solution 
is not reached soon,'' he warned.
