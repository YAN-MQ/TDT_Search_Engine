Pierrick Bourgeat of France, mastering a course badly rutted by snow 
and warming temperatures, skied from 14th place to a stunning victory 
in a men's World Cup slalom on Sunday. Bourgeat, whose best previous 
performance was a second last year, made up over two seconds on the 
field in the afternoon run, thanks in large part to his skill at maneuvering 
through ruts that tossed his competition like rag dolls. ``I don't 
like these conditions, but I still skied very hard,'' said Bourgeat, 
who was so overcome by his victory he kept forgetting words in English, 
a language he speaks well. ``On my second run, I decided I must take 
chances. ``It's great, it's wonderful, it's magnificent!'' It was 
the first French slalom victory since a 1996 triumph by Sebastian 
Amiez, who settled for sixth on Sunday. Bourgeat had a second run 
of 51.19 seconds. Although not the fastest of the afternoon, it was 
1.5 or more seconds ahead of anyone else who skied late in the session. 
Bourgeat completed two runs in 1 minute, 43.34 seconds, a healthy 
.44 seconds faster than Norway's Olympic champion, Hans-Petter Buraas, 
who led the Frenchman by 1.67 seconds after a morning session run 
during a snowstorm. Although blue skies reappeared for the second 
run, an army of course workers was unable to sweep away the snow cover, 
and the racers soon built that loose snow into huge ruts, particularly 
on the gates midway down the steep portion of the Clementine layout. 
Austria's Christian Mayer, who would claim third in 1:44.02, said 
he didn't ski his best. ``But this is a very tough course under these 
conditions,'' he said. ``I'm very excited about this weekend because 
I'm skiing very well.'' Mayer, second in Friday's giant slalom, parlayed 
his two-podium weekend into the lead in the World Cup overall standings. 
He has 190 points to 180 for teammate Stefan Eberharter, who doesn't 
ski slalom. Mayer had just finished when the five heavy hitters from 
the first run, four Norwegians and a Slovenian, lined up to try their 
luck. Each charged from the gate and handled the top gates well, but 
each was jostled from gate to gate midway down the steeps. Slovenia's 
Jure Kosir, second in the morning, almost came to a halt after crashing 
into one of the ruts, a collision that helped drop him to 12th. Buraas 
came closest to mastering the mid-steep minefield, although he couldn't 
approach Burgeat's time. Kjetil Andre Aamodt, a close fifth in the 
morning, dropped to a tie for ninth and teammate Ole Kristian Furuseth 
went from fourth to 16th. ``I had trouble with some of the bumps but 
I felt better at the bottom,'' said Buraas, who has gone back to his 
natural brown hair color after sporting a fright-wig red dye job for 
the Olympics. ``I'm glad to still be in the top three.'' First-run 
leader Finn Christian Jagge, who enjoyed a 1.89-second lead over Bourgeat 
after the first run, slipped back to a tie for fourth with Germany's 
Markus Eberle in 1:44.06, losing an amazing 2.61 seconds to the Frenchman. 
Rounding out the top 10 were Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, Canada's 
Thomas Grandi and, tied for ninth, Aamodt and Frenchman Francois Simond.
