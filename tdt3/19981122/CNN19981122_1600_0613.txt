The FBI has opened a new high-tech, football-field-size crisis center. 
The FBI says the new nerve center symbolizes the new challenges the 
agency faces. But critics wonder if it is gaining too much power. 
Pierre Thomas reports. Welcome to the FBI. And in 90 years, enormous 
changes obviously in the size of the organization, the complexity 
of it, the mission. The new FBI strategic information and operations 
center. A $20 million communications hub, capable of allowing the 
FBI to cope with five major crises simultaneously. The center symbolizes 
the FBI's ever-expanding mission in an increasingly sophisticated 
crime world. A world of international crime, cybercrime, transnational 
terrorists. If you add to that chemical, biological agents, we're 
in a whole new venue in terms of threats and vulnerabilities. And 
we have to be competent to first of all prevent that, and also to 
react to it when we have to. A major disaster of international proportion 
in Oklahoma City -- Freeh says FBI successes in the investigations 
of the bombings of Oklahoma City, the world trade center and capturing 
international terrorists prove the need for new capacities. As a result, 
a budget that stood at $625 million in 1980 has ballooned to $3 billion 
in 1998. But critics point to failures like the bloody siege at Waco 
and worry. One danger is simply that to centralize that kind of power 
in the federal government poses a greater risk, that when it is abused, 
it can cause substantial disruption. The FBI says they've learned 
from past mistakes, but they say changing times require them to extend 
their reach. Pierre Thomas, CNN, Washington.
