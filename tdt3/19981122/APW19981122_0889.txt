Finance ministers from the European Union's 11 left-leaning governments 
gathered Sunday to prepare for intensified economic policy coordination 
after the launch of the euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1. 
The ministers released a document entitled ``The New European Way,'' 
which outlines how the socialists plan to use their new power in the 
EU to make growth and job-creation its top economic priority. Left-of-center 
governments now run all but four of the EU's 15 nations, including 
the four largest: Germany, France, Italy and Britain. ``Our task is 
to find a way of marrying together an open, competitive and successful 
economy with a just and human society,'' the document says. ``Central 
is the objective of reconstructing a full-employment society, a society 
in which there are job opportunities for all citizens.'' The drive 
for closer cooperation is spearheaded by Germany's new finance minister 
Oskar Lafontaine and his French counterpart Dominique Strauss-Kahn. 
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has lined up behind 
them, although Britain will be staying out of the euro project for 
now. Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired the meeting, 
said the arrival of the euro heralded ``a new phase'' that obliged 
nations to cooperate on areas such as taxation, prices and wage policy. 
``We must have coordination if European economic policy is to bring 
results,'' Edlinger told a news conference ahead of the meeting. The 
socialist ministers met over dinner at a Brussels hotel on the eve 
of the regular monthly meeting of all 15 EU nations, the first for 
Lafontaine who took office after his Social Democratic Party won elections 
in September. In their 11-page ``policy agenda,'' the socialist ministers 
supported public spending on infrastructure and public services and 
call for ``a social contract ... which gives to all citizens a stake 
in the development of the European economy.'' However the document 
also insists tight budgets are essential to underpin the euro's stability. 
The socialists called on the new European Central Bank to take account 
of ``growth and employment'' as well as inflation when its starts 
setting interest rates for the euro bloc. But Lafontaine the socialists 
were not seeking to undermine on the bank's independence. ``We want 
a dialogue. In a democratic society, such a proposal for a dialogue 
is no threat for the ECB's independence,'' he said after the meeting. 
Despite the commitment to pool economic ideas, policy differences 
persist among socialists governments over labor market rules, taxes 
and public spending. Socialist unity could be put to the test Monday, 
when ministers debate the EU budget. Germany insists it pays too much 
to the Union's coffers and wants a reluctant France and Italy to shoulder 
more of the burden.
