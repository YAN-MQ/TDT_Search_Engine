Although little serious negotion has taken place at peace talks between 
leftist rebels and congressional mediators, the rebels are using the 
meeting as an opportunity to attract international attention. The 
rebels agreed to begin talks Friday for the first time in nearly two 
years, apparently in hopes of refocusing attention on their cause. 
The government has steadily reduced the rebel's area of influence 
in the last year by increasing army patrols in the southern state 
of Chiapas, dismantling maverick town councils set up by rebel supporters, 
and limiting the number of foreign observers and supporters allowed 
to visit the rebels' strongholds. Zapatista rebel leader Subcomandante 
Marcos did not attend the weekend talks, which have been marred by 
petty complaints and quarrels. But he issued a rare public statement 
Sunday calling for grassroots struggle against the government's economic 
policy. ``It is a question of survival for the country,'' Marcos wrote 
in a statement dated November 1998 ``from somewhere in the mountains 
of southeastern Mexico.'' The congressional mediation commission agreed 
to a final negotiating session Sunday, after the 29 delegates of the 
largely Indian rebel movement promised to discuss substantive issues. 
The talks were supposed to center on a proposed law guaranteeing Indian 
rights, but the rebels had limited Friday's session to complaints 
about accommodations and security at the meeting in San Cristobal, 
a Chiapas city 460 miles (735 kms) southeast of Mexico City. The congressmen 
got so fed up with rebel complaints Saturday that they offered to 
stop the talks and escort the delegates back to their remote villages 
in eastern Chiapas.
