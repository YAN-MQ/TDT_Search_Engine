Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Sunday that Israel is renewing 
efforts to reach an agreement in which it could withdraw its troops 
from south Lebanon. ``The army is there in order to give an answer 
to the security threat to our northern border. I have called upon 
the Lebanese government time and again to come sign a security agreement 
that would change the deployment in the security zone,'' Mordechai 
told reporters. ``We will continue to seek initiatives and new ways 
of thinking,'' Mordechai said. The Israeli army carved out an enclave 
in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect against cross-border guerrilla 
raids into Israeli communities. Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas 
have been fighting to oust Israeli forces and their Lebanese militia 
allies from the zone and popular pressure has mounted within Israel 
to bring its soldiers home. Mordechai made his remarks as he toured 
the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 
War. Syria wants the heights back in exchange for any peace deal but 
the Israeli government has said the strategic plateau was essential 
for its security. Israel radio said Mordechai was also ready to restart 
talks with Syria immediately on the issue of the Golan. U.S.-brokered 
talks between the two parties based on territorial compromise were 
frozen in 1996. Syria's role to Israeli peace with Lebanon is vital 
because it maintains 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is considered the 
main power-broker there. Lebanon has said it was not willing to negotiate 
with Israel unless a deal included the return of the heights to Syria.
