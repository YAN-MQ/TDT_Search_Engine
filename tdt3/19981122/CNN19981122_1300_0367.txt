At least six people have been killed in Jakarta, Indonesia, during 
a clash between two religious groups. Hundreds of Muslims burned a 
Christian church and a gambling hall. They threw rocks at soldiers, 
who responded with warning shots and tear gas. Muslims say fighting 
broke out after reports that a group of Christians had attacked a 
mosque. Last week, anti-government demonstrations claimed at least 
16 lives.
