In "focus" this evening -- a growing court fight over the separation 
of church and state. It's happening in Arizona, but two dozen other 
states could face the same battle. Here's NBC's Dan Lothian. It's 
not the Bible under attack in Arizona -- just a State-declared proclamation 
to celebrate it this week. What the American civil liberties union 
called "unconstitutional." It's not the business of government to 
be in the business of religion. So the battle over "Bible week" landed 
in this federal courthouse after governor Jane Hull refused to back 
down. The proclamation has come out and it will not be rescinded. 
a tough stand on a tradition that began almost 60 years ago by a Group 
of businessmen, as the U.S. stood on the brink of world war II. They 
wanted to encourage the people in the dark days of the war. Today, 
almost 30 governors coast to coast, and more than 400 mayors nationwide 
have signed "Bible week" proclamations. And this year, what has become 
a Thanksgiving week tradition was kicked off in New York City, where 
the organization behind national Bible week honored states, cities 
and companies that are now on board. The Bible is a popular book, 
the world's best-seller. In fact, some surveys show nine out of ten 
Americans have a copy in their homes. But those same surveys reveal, 
only half of those who have a Bible actually read it on a regular 
basis. So Bible week is billed as a way to get those books off the 
shelves and into hands. In no way are we encouraging people to violate 
the first amendment. We are only encouraging people to read a book, 
not to engage in religious activity. But a federal judge in Arizona 
upheld the ACLU's objection, and issued a temporary restraining order 
against that state's proclamation, saying -- earlier, the same judge 
blocked local observance in Gilbert, arizona, angering the mayor. 
They have circumvented my free speech rights. The city of Tucson canceled 
its declaration, rather than face a Court fight. The ACLU is claiming 
victory. The proclamation is unconstitutional. I think it cannot be 
clearer than that. We are going to fight this ruling. Support for 
that fight is far from unanimous. In a public opinion poll, 44% of 
those surveyed believe Bible week is constitutional. 28% say it's 
a violation. It does seem to favor one religion over another. I think 
the Bible is something this country was built on. And while other 
states have proclamations urging people to read the Bible this week, 
a court in Arizona has people there discussing it. Dan Lothian, NBC 
news.
