The U.S. and Britain have made no secret of their desire to see Saddam 
hussein overthrown. Tomorrow, here in London, the leaders of several 
Iraqi opposition groups will meet with the British foreign minister. 
ABC's Mike Lee reports on the effort to strengthen Saddam's enemies. 
This time around, Iraqi opposition groups want guarantees of U.S. 
of the disastrous uprising against Saddam in 1991. Dissident leaders 
remember how ieve thu.ened swithpeon desert storm and had given the 
een light to try a oust him. But they also remember how that rebellion 
was crushed because America allowed Saddam The Iraqi people who rose 
up felt they'd been betrayed, which will make it much more difficult 
for them to do anything again. But over the past week, the U.S. has 
once again been encouraging the iraqiepubthis weekend, a new American-run, 
radio-free Iraq is broadcasting pro-west programs to Iraq in Arabic. 
And President Clinton's recent remarks about wanting to see Saddam 
replaced has electrified exiled opposition leaders. The Iraqi people 
will move if they know that the United States is going to support 
them and is going to prevent Saddam from using his advanced weaponry 
to suppress them again. Admad Chalabi has a specific proposal -- set 
up and enforce no-fly, no-drive, safe-haven zones inside Iraq for 
a new opposition government and military. The idea is that Iraqi soldiers 
would defect and overthrow Saddam. Even though Congress has earmarked 
$97 million for the removal of Saddam, most nations do not support 
such a plan. And, say Middle East analysts, the over 70 Iraqi opposition 
groups are themselves not united. The record of the last seven years 
since the war of '91, is that if you throw guns and money and facilities 
at the Iraqi opposition, they'll fight among themselves. Those divisions 
have helped keep Saddam in power. But tomorrow, in meetings with British 
officials, at least some Iraqi opposition groups will join together.
