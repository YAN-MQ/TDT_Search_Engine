Britain's Peter Dumbreck outdueled Brazil's Richard Mauricio and won 
the Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix Sunday by three-hundredths of a second. 
Earlier, a fireman was killed and four other people were injured when 
a car hit them during a minor race. The fatal accident occurred during 
the saloon car event when a vehicle plowed into two firemen and three 
other people when they were trying to put out a fire in another car. 
Despite a third-place finish in the first half of the race, Dumbreck 
drove his Dallara F398 Toyota-TOM'S to victory in the 30-lap race 
with a combined time of one hour, 12 minutes, 49.588 seconds. ``I 
went to the last thinking I've just got to finish this lap because 
here you're always in danger of going off,'' said Dumbreck. The 6.2-kilometer 
(3.8-mile) circuit around the Portuguese enclave's narrow streets 
and hairpin bends is run in two legs of 15 laps each. Driving at an 
average 151.26 kph (93.78 mph), Dumbreck kept behind Mauricio in the 
second leg, which was good enough for him to win. Dumbreck had recorded 
his best time of 2 minutes, 15.727 seconds in the final lap of the 
first leg, driving at an average 162.32 kph (100.86 mph). Although 
Mauricio was fastest in the second leg, the 19-year-old Brazilian's 
fifth-place finish in the first 15 laps left him second overall with 
a combined time of 1:12:49.591. Brazil's Enrique Bernoldi finished 
third in a Dallara F398 Renault-RS, after starting the second leg 
in the pole position. ``I had a good start, but the problem was everyone 
just went past me and I couldn't do anything,'' said the 20-year-old 
Bernoldi, who was visibly disappointed at finishing in the same place 
he did last year. Mauricio, who recorded the fastest time in Saturday's 
qualifying in his Dallara F398 Honda-Mugen, said he ``didn't know 
why'' he couldn't shake off the 25-year-old Dumbreck, from Kircadly, 
Scotland, the Japanese Formula 3 champion. ``Dumbreck didn't let go. 
I was so close but he just went ahead by a fraction of a second,'' 
said Mauricio, who placed seventh in the British Formula 3 race early 
this year. Bas Leinders, a 23-year-old Belgian driver, recorded the 
fastest lap, covering the last lap of the first leg in 2 minutes, 
14.491 seconds at an average 163.81 kph (101.79 mph). He finished 
eighth overall. Macau's 21-year-old Andre Couto brushed the barrier 
with his Dallara F397 Opel-Spiess while turning at the notorious 90-degree 
Lisboa Bend. Couto swerved, stopped, and restarted. He fell behind 
the pack, but caught up and finished seventh. Security for the race 
was tight after two unidentified men on a motorcycle hurled a homemade 
explosive on the circuit Friday. The motive for the attack was not 
known. Originally conceived as a weekend treasure hunt in cars, the 
event attained Formula 3 status only in 1983. Formula 1 champions 
Michael Schumacher, Mikka Hakkinen and David Coulthard all have driven 
in this race, Asia's longest-running auto-racing event.
