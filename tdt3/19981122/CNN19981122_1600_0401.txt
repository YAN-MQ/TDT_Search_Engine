President Clinton may be out of the country, but his impeachment inquiry 
dominates the work of the house Judiciary committee. House speaker-designate 
Bob Livingston wants the matter wrapped up this year and says a special 
session may be needed if the Judiciary committee votes on articles 
of impeachment soon. Lawmakers from both parties say they hope to 
deal with the issue as quickly as possible, but differ on the eventual 
outcome. I am becoming more and more convinced, unless the president 
comes forward and testifies and tell us otherwise, that we have some 
very serious felony crimes this president has committed. And that 
a jury would find that, both in terms of the perjury before the grand 
jury and the civil deposition, but also in terms of trying to convince 
Monica Lewinsky to lie in her affidavit, to conceal the truth of what 
happened in their relationship in the Jones case, as well as in hiding 
the gifts. And if those are felonies, if indeed he committed those 
crimes, then I cannot see how you can relate those as anything less 
than you would bribery or any other high crime and misdemeanor, and 
that's a very serious, impeachable set of offenses. The question that 
every constitutional scholar I have spoken to and over 400 have written 
about says that is not what the founding fathers intended as an impeachable 
offense. And although everybody made sort of fun of Arlen specter's 
suggestion that this be dropped and we move on and let Starr go ahead 
and indict him, I don't think this should be dropped. I think that 
the house should come to its milk. Make a decision. Demonstrate it 
has the capacity to arrive at a bipartisan decision on this. And if 
they conclude that nothing could or should happen, then I think that 
we should move on. If Starr has a case, have him make it. Indict the 
president when he leaves office.
