Kate Winslet, star of the Oscar-winning movie ``Titanic,'' was married 
Sunday to assistant film director Jim Threapleton in a quiet ceremony 
at her family's local church. About 150 guests, including actress 
Emma Thompson and actor Greg Wise, attended the afternoon wedding 
at All Saints' Church in Reading, southern England. After the half-hour 
service the 23-year-old actress, in a white Edwardian-style gown, 
posed briefly for photographs with her new husband, 25, who wore a 
suit with a dark frock coat. ``The whole thing was tremendously relaxed 
and happy. It was a big success story today,'' said the Rev. John 
Mortiboys, who conducted the service. ``They were trying to keep everything 
as secret as possible because you can imagine what it is like in the 
glare of the publicity all of the time,'' he said. The reception, 
held about 10 miles (16 km) away at a 17th century pub, included a 
simple meal featuring ``bangers and mash,'' or sausaages and mashed 
potatoes, a traditional hearty dish. The newlyweds came outside briefly 
to talk to reporters. ``It was quite amazing,'' said the bride. ``It 
was the most amazing day of our lives.'' Asked by reporters what had 
been the highlight of her day, she said: ``Exchanging of the vows. 
I think it was an incredible feeling.'' A four-piece Irish fiddle 
band could be heard playing the tune from the ``Titanic'' scene where 
Ms. Winslet's character dances a jig. Pub proprietor Paul Clerehugh 
said it was a ``very informal'' occasion.
