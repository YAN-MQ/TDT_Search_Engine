Dariush Foruhar, an opposition figure and former labor minister, was 
stabbed to death Sunday along with his wife at their Tehran home, 
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. It was not clear 
who killed the couple or what their motive may have been, the agency 
said. Police were investigating, it said. Foruhar was the leader of 
the People's Party of Iran, a small opposition group that is tolerated 
by the government. He served as minister of labor and social affairs 
in the provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately 
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the monarchy.
