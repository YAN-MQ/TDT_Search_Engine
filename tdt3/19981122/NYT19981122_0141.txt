Dick Sisler, a member of a prominent baseball family who gained his 
own niche in the sport's history with a pennant-winning home run for 
the Philadelphia Phillies' 1950 Whiz Kids team, died Friday in his 
hometown of Nashville, Tenn. He was 78. Sisler had been suffering 
from pneumonia, his family said. When the Phillies faced the Dodgers 
at Ebbets Field on the final Sunday of the 1950 season, they held 
a one-game edge on Brooklyn in a bid for their first pennant since 
1915. The last time the Phils had won anything, Sisler's father, George, 
was a rookie first baseman for the St. Louis Browns. The elder Sisler 
became a Hall of Famer and later an executive with the Dodgers. On 
that day in 1950, he was sitting behind the Brooklyn dugout. The Phils, 
who had squandered a large lead in the final two weeks and faced a 
playoff if they lost that Sunday, were tied with the Dodgers, 1-1, 
going into the ninth inning. The game stayed tied when the Dodgers' 
Cal Abrams was ill-advisedly sent home from second base on a single 
to short center field, and the Phils' Richie Ashburn threw him out 
by a wide margin. In the top of the 10th, Sisler, the Phillies' left 
fielder and a left-handed batter, came to the plate against the Dodgers' 
best pitcher, the right-hander Don Newcombe, with two men on and one 
out. Sisler already had three singles and had scored the Phils' only 
run although playing with a sprained right wrist that was heavily 
taped. He was hoping he would not get an inside pitch, because the 
wrist injury made it hard to connect if he was jammed. With the count 
one ball and two strikes, Newcombe threw a fastball on the outside 
corner. Sisler hit a drive to the opposite field and, as Abrams watched, 
the ball landed in the lower left-field seats. Sisler had given the 
Phillies a 4-1 lead, and as he ran toward second base, he jumped up 
and down, his arms raised in exultation. When he touched home plate, 
he was mobbed by his teammates. Robin Roberts, Philadelphia's ace 
starter, retired the Dodgers in order in the bottom of the 10th, and 
the Phillies were pennant winners after a 35-year drought. They were 
swept by the Yankees in the World Series, but this team _ known as 
the Whiz Kids for its mostly youthful cast _ would long be remembered. 
Sisler, a month short of his 30th birthday when he hit his dramatic 
homer, was one of the oldest Whiz Kids. A native of St. Louis, he 
made his major league debut with the World Series champion Cardinals 
in 1946, then was traded to the Phillies before the 1948 season. The 
1950 season was Sisler's best. He batted .296 with 13 homers and 83 
RBIs and made the All-Star team. But he played only one more year 
with the Phillies before being traded to the Cincinnati Reds, then 
finished his career back with the Cardinals in 1953. Over eight seasons, 
playing the outfield and first base, he batted .276 with 55 home runs. 
Sisler served as the Reds' manager for part of 1964 and all of 1965, 
succeeding Fred Hutchinson when he was stricken with cancer. Sisler 
was later a batting instructor for the Cardinals, San Diego Padres 
and Mets and a minor league manager. He is survived by his wife, Dorothy; 
a son, Richard; three daughters, Kathleen Hand, Patricia Sweeney and 
Shari Patterson; two brothers, Dave, who pitched in the major leagues 
for seven seasons, and George Jr., a former president of the International 
League; a sister, Francis Drochelman, 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. 
Although burdened with the wrist bandage, Sisler had something else 
with him for his dramatic at-bat that final Sunday in 1950. When the 
taxi he was taking to Ebbets Field with his teammates Del Ennis, Russ 
Meyer and Willie (Puddin' Head) Jones stopped for a light, a car with 
a priest in it pulled alongside. The priest recognized the players 
and offered Sisler a rose, saying it had been blessed. Sisler said, 
``Father, I'm not a Catholic.'' The priest replied: ``Take it anyway. 
Maybe it will bring you good luck.'' Sisler kept the rose with him 
during the game and, as he remembered it: ``When I came up to bat 
in the 10th inning, I thought of the rose in my pocket. I reached 
in my hand and touched it. I doubt that it had anything to do with 
what happened afterward, but who knows?''
