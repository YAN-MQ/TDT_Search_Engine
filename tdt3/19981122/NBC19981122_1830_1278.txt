To Russia now, and the quest to keep its struggling economy afloat. 
Moscow believes it's found a tonic in the national beverage. NBC's 
Dana Lewis, in Moscow tonight. Presidential toasts, matrimonial oaths 
-- little is done in russia without vodka. The average Russian consumes 
an estimated half a bottle a day. Now vodka has been labeled the elixir 
to save the nation's economy. Vodka production and sale is a free 
market enterprise. But now, the government is moving back toward the 
state control of the soviet era. The reason is money. Little is nearer 
or dearer to the Russian heart or pocketbook than vodka. In the old 
Soviet days, vodka sales accounted for 30% of the national budget. 
Now it's only 3%, and the government wants to change all that. The 
government has shut down tens of thousands of small shopkeepers, like 
samson. It's a move to limit the number of retailers and to ensure 
that taxes are paid. "Who needs these measures?" He says. "Now we're 
out of business. Today it's vodka, tomorrow it will be cigarettes, 
and soon we'll have the old Soviet Union." The government says now 
that raids over the last two months are meant only to bust the shadow 
vodka trade, to catch those who produce moonshine and to crack down 
on licensed manufacturers who Dodge state taxes. By some estimates, 
the profit from illegal vodka is already equal to the sale of narcotics 
in Russia -- $4 billion last year. Now only selected manufacturers 
will be allowed to produce and bottle Russian vodka. Already tighter 
state control means a bottle, which sells for $1.25 could soon jump 
to $1.60. samson says he will defy the new policy and sell vodka on 
the underground market. Customers have stocked up. One of them, Alexander, 
who, like other pensioners, lives by selling a few bottles each night 
at the train station. But even he is being targeted these days. Soon 
he'll be out of the vodka business, and the government, back in. Dana 
Lewis, NBC news, Moscow.
