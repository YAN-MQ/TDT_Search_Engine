Albanians voted in drizzling rain Sunday in a controversial but peaceful 
referendum meant to give Europe's poorest country its first post-communist 
Constitution. Foreign election observers and national media reported 
almost no referendum-related violence in this Balkan nation where 
gunfire and intimidation have marked past elections. Albania's Central 
Election Commission said about 46 per cent of nearly two million eligible 
voters cast their ballots by 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) _ two hours before 
polling stations closed _ despite a nationwide boycott called by powerful 
opposition leaders. Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) Sunday. The 
commission had no preliminary results on how many voted for or against 
the proposed Constitution but most who voted were expected to approve 
it. ``The whole referendum was pretty quiet, even though everybody 
kept saying that bad things would happen,'' said Andrea Angeli, spokesman 
for the observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe. ``There was just one incident that was apparently related 
to the referendum.'' He said unknown assailants Saturday night used 
explosives to damage a polling station near the northern town of Bajram 
Curri but nobody was injured. Final referendum results are expected 
only late Monday after the referendum authorities fly ballots in from 
remote regions by helicopter and pass northern roads blocked by recent 
snowfalls. The OSCE, which has 200 observers nationwide with police 
protection, will release its report card on the election process also 
Monday. Voter turnout is key to the referendum which, boycotted by 
the opposition, could give Albania its framework for human, civil 
and democratic rights. Opposition Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, 
who played a key role in antigovernment unrest in September, disputed 
the election committee's turnout figures and declared the draft Constitution 
``a dead body'' due to low participation. He said no more than 31 
percent of eligible voters cast their ballots. ``The Albanians turned 
down the proposal of the most corrupted government in Europe,'' said 
Berisha in a press conference an hour after polls closed. Albanian 
government officials weren't expected to comment until final counts 
are in. Violence has flared in past voting mostly as separate factions 
squared off outside polling booths. But the boycott kept most opposition 
supporters away from the booths Sunday. Daan Everts, the head of the 
OSCE mission to Albania, said before the voting that a turnout of 
40 per cent to 50 per cent would likely be seen as reasonable, given 
the boycott call. The draft would give citizens the right to legally 
change their religion and to identify themselves as members of an 
ethnic minority. It would also define property rights and allow the 
government to expropriate land deemed of national interest. Opposition 
leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and predict many people 
will turn away from Islam, the dominant religion, to avoid discrimination 
while working in richer, non-Muslim neighbors such as Greece. They 
also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism. ``I voted yes 
because we at least have to be optimistic,'' said Hasan Malolli, a 
56-year-old teacher who voted in a Tirana suburb. ``Hope is the only 
thing that we can really do.'' Snow also closed four roads in northern 
Albania and slowed, or halted voting in some areas. And moderate rainfall 
dampened voters Sunday throughout most of the country. Prime Minister 
Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor Tirana suburb, said 
the Constitution will help boost prosperity in Europe's poorest nation. 
``I came from my apartment where there was no electricity and walked 
on an unpaved road like all Albanians _ looking reality in the eye,'' 
said Majko, as electricity failed in his polling station as well. 
``I voted for the future.'' Army sharpshooters surveyed his polling 
booth from the roofs of nearby apartment buildings and motorcycle 
police throughout Tirana searched cars with license plates from outside 
of Tirana. Fearing low turnout, the government recently scrapped a 
law requiring a referendum to be voted on by more than 50 percent 
of eligible voters.
