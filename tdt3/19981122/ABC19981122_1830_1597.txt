Finally tonight -- staying ahead of the curve. As ABC's Judy Muller 
reports in Los Angeles, it's getting downright dangerous. This may 
look like group therapy for paranoids, but it's actually the latest 
craze in physical fitness. Drop, drop, drop, drop! go! It's a self-defense 
system called krav maga. In Los Angeles, where you're a nobody if 
you're not a hard-body, it's attracting everyone from attorneys to 
actors. It doubles as a rigorous workout -- I've lost about 15 pounds. 
I feel energized. And a confidence builder -- You would never, ever 
give up in any situation. They teach you to win in everything. The 
only rule is, there are no rules. Krav maga is no-holds-barred, eye-gouging, 
hair-pulling technique that can only be simulated in the classroom. 
The body should be ready to give a head butt, should be ready to give 
an elbow, should be ready to give a knee. Nothing stops in the fight. 
Krav maga is a Hebrew term for "contact combat." It was developed 
by the Israeli military. Unlike traditional martial arts, it has no 
ritualized or choreographed moves. They had to have a system that 
could be taught quickly, not ritualistic, just down and dirty for 
the street. It can be taught quickly, because it's based on gut instinct. 
The instructors can take someone with no self-defense training and 
build on their natural reflexive moves. Eventually, the students gain 
the confidence to react quickly to threats. This movement has to be 
much faster than him pulling the trigger. So when I do this movement, 
I do the snatching movement very fast with the body defense. The technique 
is gaining popularity with police departments. The El Segundo police 
believe it's contributed to a reduction in charges of excessive force 
during arrests. It allows the officer the confidence to deal with 
the situation without having maybe to escalate to a higher level of 
force. Most of these students will never have to worry about using 
any level of force. Violent crime, after all, is down. But at least 
they will be ready, whether it's a thug on the street or a Bully on 
the playground. Good. Judy Muller, ABC News, Los Angeles.
