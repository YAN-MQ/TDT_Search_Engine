Lonnie Pitchford, a Mississippi bluesman who was dedicated to reviving 
early Delta blues, died on Nov. 8 at his home in Lexington, Miss. 
He was 43. The cause was pneumonia complications, said his manager, 
Patty Johnson. Pitchford performed around the world and appeared regularly 
in New York, often in concerts presented by the World Music Institute. 
He played the diddley-bow, a one-stringed instrument he would assemble 
onstage from a two-by-four, two nails, broom wire and a crushed snuff 
can. Using a dime as a slide, he would play driving, wailing blues 
lines. He also played guitar and occasionally piano, singing classic 
Delta blues with a pensive, haunted voice. The diddley-bow was Pitchford's 
first instrument, made from baling wire nailed to the side of his 
family's house in rural Lexington. He sang in the church from childhood 
on and learned to play piano; he was 12 when he began sharing a guitar 
with his four brothers. Pitchford learned traditional Delta blues 
from Eugene Powell (who had played with the Mississippi Sheiks in 
the 1930s) and from Robert Junior Lockwood, whose stepfather was Robert 
Johnson. Pitchford's wife, Minnie, is the daughter of Elmore James' 
girlfriend, and Pitchford learned some Elmore James songs that had 
been left with his mother-in-law. He began performing outside Mississippi 
as a teen-ager, appearing at the Smithsonian Institution's Festival 
of American Folklife from 1972 to 1991. By the 1990s he had toured 
in Europe and Australia as well as the United States. When not on 
the road, he worked as a carpenter. He appeared in the documentaries 
``The Land Where the Blues Began'' (1980) and ``Deep Blues'' (1992), 
and was recorded for five blues anthologies before he made his first 
solo album, ``All Around Man,'' for Rooster Blues Records in 1994. 
He was working on an album for Mississippi Crossroads Music. He also 
made an album with the New Africa String Band, which included Powell 
and Big Jack Johnson. Pitchford is survived by his wife; his mother, 
Rosie Pitchford; two sisters, Ersine Hodges and Brenda Jones, and 
four brothers, Willie Douglas, Andrew James, Edward Charles and Roosevelt, 
all of Mississippi.
