Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in his first comment on U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore's remarks at a Pacific Rim summit, said Sunday that 
Malaysians were disappointed and humiliated, the national news agency 
reported. Mahathir was the host for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
summit last week at which Gore supported the anti-government reform 
movement in Malaysia. Until now, he had not commented publicly on 
the vice president's remarks. Gore, who represented President Bill 
Clinton at the summit, praised the supporters of the reform movement 
of jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as ``the brave 
people of Malaysia.'' His statement caused a furor among Cabinet ministers 
and many other Malaysians, who accused Gore of interfering in Malaysia's 
internal affairs. They expressed their views in letters and large 
advertisements in newspapers, the national news agency Bernama said. 
A hot line advertised in the government-backed New Straits Times was 
hooked up over the weekend for callers to register anti-U.S. sentiments. 
Bernama said Mahathir commended the people for speaking up against 
Gore's ``offensive remarks and disgusting attitude.'' ``They voiced 
their stand because they were disappointed and humiliated by his disrespectful 
remarks,'' Mahathir told reporters after visiting a factory. ``I'm 
impressed by their stand as this is the real strength of the country.''
