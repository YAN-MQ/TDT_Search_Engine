Near Toronto, a battle is being waged over a bridge. Developers see 
it as a way of linking Toronto island to the next century. But residents 
there don't see that as progress. Natalie pawelski reports. Minutes 
by Ferry from the hustle and commotion of Canada's biggest city, Toronto 
island is cl to downtown, but also a world apart. It's very safe. 
You can let the kid move around freely. You don't have to be holding 
its hand every minute. And I think when you live on an island, you 
do, you have look right in your back yard, to find what's interesting 
to you. And what is important to you, it's all right in your back 
yard. With no private cars and little crime, Toronto's eclectic island 
community is an urban place with a different pace. Even the mail delivery 
is different. But some say a plan to build a bridge to the island 
will destroy what makes the island unique. The city has begun to sprawl. 
And it's sprawled north, east and west. It seems that there's an almost 
inevitable push to push it south as well. The bridge is supposed to 
help an airport -- three miles away at the other end of the island 
-- boost air traffic. Residents worry a busier airport will be noisier 
and dirtier. And they say the bridge would make it harder for boaters 
to get to lake ontario. But supporters say building a bridge would 
allow emergency vehicles to get to the island more quickly, and make 
it easier to get from the airport to downtown. We are the only city 
that has a city center airport where visitors, tourists and visiting 
people, can fly right to within walking distance of the major venues. 
So this would be a tremendous advantage in terms of our bid for the 
2008 olympics. The bridge won't be built anytime soon. Toronto's city 
council is still looking at how the project would affect boaters and 
the environment. Islanders say a bridge is only the latest threat 
to their community. In the 1950s, for example, the city was planning 
to turn this neighborhood into a park. The sirens that used to rally 
residents when the wrecking crews moved in still stand. So does the 
drive to save this place, as is. Well maybe it should be preserved 
just because people love it so much. That there are people who have 
been willing to stick around here and fight for it. Natalie pawelski,
