This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather update." 
A front goes stationary across Florida. That will mean rain showers 
and a few thunderstorms from Louisiana into the florida Panhandle 
southward to near lake okeechobee. A cold front will be moving through 
the plains states. Generally looking at cloudy skies and windy conditions 
with the front, but cooler temperatures will be settling in. Another 
in a series of low pressure systems will move into the northwest, 
so look for soaking rain from San Francisco to the puget sound with 
snowfall potentially heavy inland. High temperatures only in the 40s 
and 50s for most of the northern tier of states, with 60s and 70s 
to the south. Southern Florida could see highs in the 80s. The extended 
forecast includes heavy rain Tuesday across the northwest with a mix 
of rain and snow for the eastern lakes. Look for scattered thunderstorms 
for the gulf states that end by Wednesday. But a mix of rain and snow 
could become heavy in the western Great Lakes as a third system enters 
the northwest. Heavy rain continues in your forecast through Thursday. 
The extended forecast for more than 7,000 cities can be found at CNN.com.
