Republican governors meeting in New Orleans this weekend are being 
urged to help change the party's image. Jim Nicholson, the chairman 
of the republican national committee, says the governors will help 
the party reach out to women and minorities. He hopes that will help 
target the party's message and widen its appeal. Republicans lost 
five house seats in the midterm election.
