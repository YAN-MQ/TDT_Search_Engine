A record-setting sports sale could be in the works. Reports out of 
New York say cablevision systems is about to buy the yankees. Owner 
George Steinbrenner reportedly is willing to part with the world champion 
Bronx bombers for $600 million. He bought the team you might remember, 
for $10 million 25 years ago. The deal would take effect on January 
1st, with Steinbrenner continuing to run the team. It would be the 
most expensive sale ever of a U.S. sports franchise.
