Tom Wolfe has long aspired to be the Balzac of his age, and up in 
Washington Heights it is clear that he has at least partially succeeded. 
He, too, has been spurned by the Academy. Wolfe has been repeatedly 
nominated but rejected for membership in the American Academy of Arts 
and Letters, which is ensconced in a marble neoclassical palace on 
West 155th Street. The institution is modeled on the Academie Francaise, 
the group traditionally known as the ``immortals,'' although today 
some of those French authors are remembered chiefly for their refusal 
to admit Balzac (and Moliere, among others). The American Academy 
limits membership to 250 ``pre-eminent'' writers and artists, whose 
chief duty, besides supervising prizes and grants to young artists, 
is to elect replacements for deceased members each year. ``The honor 
of election,'' the Academy says in its brochure, ``is the highest 
formal recognition of artistic merit in this country.'' Starting with 
Mark Twain, one of the original members a century ago, the Academy's 
novelists and poets and journalists are all on display in a portrait 
gallery. Today's members are a mixture of the famous and the not-so-famous, 
among them Saul Bellow, John Hollander, James Thomas Flexner, Jules 
Feiffer, Toni Morrison, Daniel Aaron, Josephine Jacobsen, John McPhee, 
Kurt Vonnegut, Joyce Carol Oates, Mark Strand, Eric Bentley, J.F. 
Powers and Shirley Hazzard. There can be awkward pauses when you point 
to a portrait and confess your literary ignorance to Virginia Dajani, 
the executive director of the Academy. ``Uh ... what did he write?'' 
``Um ... I'll check his bio.'' When you contemplate this modern pantheon, 
you might wonder if Wolfe has added more phrases to the English language 
than the entire Academy. Radical chic, the Me Decade, the Right Stuff, 
masters of the universe, social X-rays, _ what other social commentator, 
in fiction or nonfiction, has been quoted so often for so long? But 
his style obviously did not please some Academy members. John Updike, 
the chairman of the Academy's centennial committee, recently proclaimed 
in The New Yorker that ``A Man in Full,'' Wolfe's new novel, is ``entertainment, 
not literature, even literature in a modest aspirant form.'' Updike 
also revealed that his sensibilities rendered him unable to finish 
``The Bonfire of the Vanities.'' This sort of criticism sounds familiar 
to Graham Robb, the author of ``Balzac,'' a 1994 biography. ``To the 
French literary establishment, Balzac had a disheveled style and was 
working in the wrong genre,'' Robb said. ``The novel was considered 
rather disreputable and journalistic.'' One of Wolfe's supporters, 
Murray Kempton, who belonged to the Academy until his death last year, 
used to say that Wolfe was rejected in favor of other novelists and 
journalists because of his conservative ideology. That suspicion is 
shared by the novelist Cynthia Ozick, another member who voted for 
him. ``I imagine his politics may have influenced some votes,'' she 
said. Wolfe has offended just about every bloc of the Academy during 
his career, starting with his 1965 attack on The New Yorker, headlined: 
``Tiny Mummies! The True Story of the Ruler of 43rd Street's Land 
of the Walking Dead!'' He went on to write manifestoes eviscerating 
modern fiction, modern art and modern architecture _ not the best 
strategy for winning votes in the Academy. Wolfe has managed in the 
past to survive the first round of balloting, during which the 120 
writers choose the nominees for the vacancies in literature, but he 
has failed to get the requisite majority in the second round, when 
all 250 members vote. Apparently whatever support he gets from writers 
is negated by the animus from the Academy's architects and artists. 
But perhaps the members will finally relent in this year's election, 
which will be conducted in the coming weeks. Now that Wolfe has yet 
another wildly successful novel out, the situation is becoming a bit 
embarrassing. ``I think he'll be elected this year,'' said Louis Auchincloss, 
the novelist who is the president of the Academy. ``I spoke strongly 
in favor of him at the annual meeting. I think he's a great novelist.'' 
At least one other member has committed to Wolfe's cause. ``Speaking 
as one of the immortals,'' Art Buchwald said, ``I can promise him 
my vote. Poor Tom, he won't be able to make a living if he's not a 
member.''
