A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed early Sunday in an entertainment 
district of Bogota after an argument in a bar, authorities said. Frank 
Arnold Moreno, 37, was shot once in the back in the city's ``Zona 
Rosa,'' or Pink Zone, at about 1 a.m. outside the El Divino bar, U.S. 
and Colombian officials said. A bystander was also shot and wounded 
in the neck, they said, adding that police were pursuing a suspect. 
Moreno, who had been in Colombia for about a year, was not with any 
other Drug Enforcement Administration agents at the time and was slain 
after what one U.S. Embassy official called ``a bar brawl.'' ``I don't 
think it had anything to do with drugs,'' said the official, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. ``I understand he was walking away and 
then boom, boom.'' Moreno was shot from behind and the 9mm bullet 
entered his torso at kidney level, a senior Colombian police official 
said on condition of anonymity. Two witnesses took Moreno to a Bogota 
hospital, where he was declared dead. It was not immediately known 
whether Moreno was carrying a gun, who shot the bystander or how many 
shots were fired, the police official said, adding that Moreno had 
initiated the quarrel. He did not disclose the wounded man's identity 
or condition. An embassy official said Moreno and the gunman had been 
told to leave the bar just before the shooting, which occurred in 
Bogota's most active nightlife area, an upscale neighborhood or restaurants, 
bars and discotheques that is crowded with people well after midnight 
on weekends. Moreno, of Edinburg, Texas, was recently married and 
had previously been assigned to Oklahoma City, officials said, adding 
that his wife lived with him in Bogota. Authorities would not say 
whether the killing was directly related to a drug investigation; 
Colombian drug traffickers, who have been trying to keep a low profile 
after the 1995 arrests of the Cali cartel's top leaders, know that 
murdering a U.S. drug agent would likely trigger a feverish investigative 
backlash. U.S. officials said they did not think a DEA agent had ever 
been killed in Colombia before, although two were shot and wounded 
in 1982. The DEA has an estimated 50 agents in Colombia, the world's 
leading producer and exporter of cocaine. Some 80 percent of the cocaine 
and a growing amount of the heroin sold on U.S. streets comes from 
Colombia. Colombia has one of the world's highest murder rates, with 
about 27,000 murders a year, the vast majority unrelated to the country's 
civil conflict and drug trafficking.
