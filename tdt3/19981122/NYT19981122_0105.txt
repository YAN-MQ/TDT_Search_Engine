A year ago, after winning the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
cross-country title, Carrie Tollefson of Villanova was diagnosed with 
a rare tumor in her left heel. She was told by doctors that she might 
never run again. Preparing for an operation last February to drain 
the tumor to and implant a bone from a cadaver in her foot to fill 
in the hole, Tollefson was cautioned by her surgeons. ``They told 
me, `Just don't get your hopes up. This is serious,' '' she said. 
Yet, on Monday, Tollefson will defend her NCAA title in Lawrence, 
Kan. In a surprise in 1997, she defeated the defending champion and 
six-time NCAA track titlist Amy Skieresz of Arizona by 70 meters in 
16 minutes 29 seconds for 5,000 meters. Tollefson, now a 21-year-old 
senior, will also play a pivotal role in Villanova's attempt to win 
its seventh women's team championship, with its chief competition 
expected to come from Brigham Young, which won it last year, and Stanford, 
the 1996 champion. ``I think I have a good chance to win,'' Tollefson 
said. ``I'm not going to use my ordeal as an excuse.'' Tollefson has 
undergone two ordeals. When she returned to training last summer, 
she pushed too hard, developed tendinitis in the back of her knee 
and had to take three weeks off in September. It appeared that her 
comeback had failed but Tollefson fought back to place fourth in the 
Big East meet on Oct. 30 at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, her first 
race in 11 months. ``Carrie was training very hard to catch up,'' 
said first-year coach Marcus O'Sullivan, an Irish Olympian and Villanova 
alumnus. O'Sullivan, who oversees both the Villanova men's and women's 
teams, had originally thought he would have to redshirt Tollefson. 
``She wanted to defend in November,'' he said. ``In October, it was 
time to roll the dice.'' In Lawrence, Tollefson will again face Skieresz, 
also a senior and undefeated this season. Other contenders include 
Amy Yoder of Arkansas and Julia Stamps of Stanford. The women's course 
is 6,000 meters (about 3.75 miles), lengthened this year to conform 
to international cross-country distances. The men's favorites in the 
10,000-meter race are Adam Goucher of Colorado and Kenya's Julius 
Mwangi of Butler. Mwangi defeated Goucher on the same course on Oct. 
10. The team favorites are Stanford, the defender, eight-time winner 
Arkansas, and Oregon, bidding to give its retiring coach Bill Dellinger 
the Ducks' first men's crown since 1977. Tollefson, who grew up in 
Dawson, Minn. (pop. 1,626), has made coming back her life's work. 
She was born with an aneurysm in a lung and almost did not survive 
infancy. The child grew to become a star runner, with 108 straight 
track and cross-country victories, plus 13 state titles in high school. 
She grew to 5 feet 9 inches and became a top-rated point guard on 
the high school basketball team. In her spare time, Tollefson played 
violin in the school orchestra, trumpet in the band and sang in the 
choir. When the Villanova assistant women's coach, Gina Procaccio, 
made a recruiting visit in 1994 to Dawson, a three-hour drive west 
through farmland from Minneapolis, she was stunned by Tollefson's 
local status. ``She was the town hero,'' Procaccio said. In her ideal 
world, Tollefson would run in the morning, play basketball in the 
afternoon and sing at night. ``I was a member of Villanova's gospel 
choir but could not juggle the rehearsals and had to give it up,'' 
she said. Tollefson doesn't give up on much. She came back from hernia 
surgery in 1997 to capture the NCAA title. Then came the cyst in Tollefson's 
foot. It was found to be benign and after the surgery in February, 
her leg was put in a boot-cast and she walked with crutches for two 
months. She embarked on a cross-training and a rehabilitation program 
that reached three hours daily of swimming, bicycling and weight training. 
``I'm a beast,'' Tollefson said of her new-found muscle. Tollefson 
needed to rebuild her left leg, which had atrophied. Her first run 
after surgery, on May 5, lasted a mere three minutes. In June, she 
progressed to 30 miles a week, and by the start of school in September 
she was running 50 to 60 miles a week. Eager to train at full tilt, 
Tollefson worked so hard that her leg became inflamed and she had 
to return to the bike and pool. ``We were getting close to kissing 
the season goodbye,'' she said. With each setback, though, Tollefson 
gained resolve and an appreciation of the fundamental joys of training. 
``I tell myself not to be a greedy, obsessed athlete,'' she said. 
``I'm so happy just to be running.'' Last Saturday, six months after 
her break-the-ice three-minute run, Tollefson won her NCAA district 
qualifying race at Bethlehem, Pa. She ran 17:16 for 5,000 meters, 
leading Villanova to the women's team title. In the NCAA tuneup, the 
Wildcats captured six of the top eight places. For Tollefson, whatever 
happens in Lawrence on Monday will be worth singing about. ``My career 
has been saved,'' she said.
