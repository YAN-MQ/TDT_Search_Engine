Commercial tankers get much of the blame for oil spills, but it turns 
out vessels in the U.S. Navy are far more frequent polluters. Associated 
press found between 1990 and 1997, a Navy vessel fouled U.S. waters, 
on average, every two days. It was especially bad at big Navy bases, 
like puget sound in Washington kpluted with 56,000 gallons, Norfolk, 
Virginia, where 37,000 gallons spilled, and San Diego, where 33,000 
gallons polluted the waterfront. The main reason for the spills -- 
complex, outdated fuel transfer systems aboard the ships, as well 
as human error.
