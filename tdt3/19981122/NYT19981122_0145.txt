There is often a kernel of insight in Rep. Henry Hyde's retorts as 
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and they typically refer 
to his state of mind. ``Is that five minutes?,'' Hyde, R-Ill., said 
plaintively at the impeachment hearing on Thursday as panel members 
cajoled, bullied or just stormed past the time limit. ``It seems forever.'' 
Then, as the hours rolled on, Hyde jokingly threatened to sequester 
the members for the evening, without food or water, so he could wrap 
up the hearing in one day _ or the whole proceeding in one month. 
And, when Democrats moaned at one point, he asked, ``Does anyone need 
an aspirin?'' Hyde could probably use a few doses himself. More than 
two months after the independent counsel Kenneth Starr delivered an 
impeachment referral practically on his Capitol Hill doorstep, Hyde, 
74, finds himself at the helm of a messy inquiry that Democrats denounce, 
most people decry and some poll-reading Republicans would like to 
deflate. ``He has been given an extremely hot potato,'' said Thomas 
Mann, a senior congressional analyst at the Brookings Institution. 
``He faces an extremely difficult situation, both presiding over a 
highly polarized committee and facing a situation where the American 
public, and probably his new Republican leadership, doesn't want to 
hear or see anything more of the matter that has been put before his 
committee.'' It did not start that way, at least among his Republican 
colleagues. In September, Starr's report arrived amid palpable Republican 
exuberance. There was much talk of duty and gravity, but privately 
many members were throwing confetti in the Capitol's anterooms. Hyde 
had to fight to keep the inquiry in his boisterous committee when 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested creating a select panel of members 
to deal with impeachment. Heralded as one of the most fair, even-handed 
chairmen in Congress, Hyde faced the immediate challenge of having 
to live up to his image and the dusted-off luster of his most famous 
predecessor, Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., who presided over the 
impeachment hearings dealing with President Richard Nixon. But developments 
and decisions seemed to sting Hyde, and his leaders offered him little 
cover. The committee's decision to release the Starr report, accompanying 
documents and Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony angered many 
people across the country, who viewed it as gratuitous. Then, Hyde's 
chief investigative counsel, David Schippers, expanded the number 
of counts that might constitute impeachable offenses with little explanation. 
Hyde appeared to backpedal when he announced subsequently that the 
committee would focus on three major areas and consolidate the counts. 
He failed to recognize the weight of his words and the uproar they 
could create. Off-the-cuff remarks sometimes led to clarifications, 
leaving a trail of mixed signals. At first, there was talk of extended 
hearings, a long witness list and a thorough fact-finding mission. 
Hyde has imposed an end-of-the-year deadline, and Starr may prove 
to have been the committee's only major witness, although the witness 
list is still being worked out. ``I don't think he's gotten a lot 
of help, just a lot of pressure,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters of California, 
a committee Democrat who is so persistently outspoken that she prompted 
Hyde to joke with his bodyguards on Thursday, ``Can someone protect 
me from Maxine Waters?'' Hints of possible bipartisanship have vanished. 
The word fairness _ which has been tossed around by Democrats and 
Republicans on the committee, but mostly by Democrats, in a kind of 
you-started-it refrain _ took its place. ``You do see the fairness, 
though,'' Hyde said on Thursday, after he suggested that Starr could 
reply to written questions once Clinton did the same. ``That's a big 
word around here,'' he said. ``No, I don't,'' replied Rep. Jerrold 
Nadler, D-N.Y. ``I don't see the fairness, frankly.'' The incoming 
speaker, Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, has said he wants the 
investigation wrapped up quickly. But no one is quite telling Hyde 
how to do that, in part because impeachment is now about as attractive 
to longevity-minded Republicans as carbon monoxide. ``The chairman 
should not be given all of the burden of managing this,'' Mann said. 
``It's time for the leadership to step up and figure out how to extricate 
the Republicans from the House on this matter.'' Many Democrats share 
his view. To a certain extent, though, Hyde feels duty bound, members 
and aides say, so he is forging ahead, scouting around for ways to 
bolster the case by piecing together a pattern of obstruction of justice, 
but with little time left to do it. Many Republicans on the panel 
want him to carry on, and they are rankled by what they view as a 
cavalier attitude on the part of their Republican colleagues. ``Many 
of the people on the committee believe this is not politics,'' said 
Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah, on the panel. ``This is historic. 
It is about how we govern ourselves in America.''
