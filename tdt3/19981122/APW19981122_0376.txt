A cyclone in the Bay of Bengal weakened Sunday and crossed the southern 
coast of Bangladesh, causing no reported casualties. The storm, which 
had a wind speed of 115 kph (71 mph), weakened to 50 kph (31 miles) 
when it hit land in the largely uninhabited Sundarbans jungles, the 
weather office in the capital of Dhaka said. The ports of Mongla and 
Chittagong lowered their danger signals. Authorities however asked 
thousands of fishermen to stay on land because the seas are rough. 
The Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, had posted 
nearly 33,000 volunteers along the coast where at least 10 million 
people live. The region has more than 1,200 cyclone shelters for the 
residents. An official at the Disaster and Relief Ministry said a 
large number of evacuated residents would start returning home soon. 
Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation, is buffeted by tropical cyclones 
that kill hundreds of people every year. One cyclone killed 138,000 
people along the coast in 1991.
