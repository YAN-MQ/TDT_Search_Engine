NATIONAL FORECAST After a brief reprieve on Sunday, another episode 
of stormy weather will batter the Northwest and northern California 
on Monday as a powerful Pacific low churns toward Vancouver Island. 
As a surge of very moist air is lifted by an approaching cold front, 
heavy rain will occur along the northern California coast on Monday 
morning. The area of excessive rain will shift into northwest California 
by afternoon. Local flooding is likely, particularly in those areas 
that have recently received substantial rain. As the damp air is lifted 
and cooled by the higher terrain, heavy snow will accumulate in the 
Siskyou and Sierra mountains, mainly above 6,500 feet. Meanwhile, 
windswept heavy rain will also occur in western parts of Washington 
and Oregon where some exposed coastal locations measure wind speeds 
past 60 mph. Generally tranquil conditions will cover the remainder 
of the nation as the jet stream retreats toward Canada. In the East, 
breezes from the southwest will direct unseasonably mild air toward 
the northeastern states. Amid ample sunshine, afternoon readings will 
reach the 60s from the Ohio Valley to southeastern Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, 
a large high-pressure system will promote dry and warm weather from 
the southern Plains to the lower Mississippi Valley. A moisture-starved 
cool front will bring clouds and a few sprinkles to the Great Lakes 
on Monday. Elsewhere, an area of showers will surround low pressure 
over the northeast Gulf of Mexico while partly sunny and humid conditions 
persist in southern Florida. Focus: All About Wind High-wind warnings 
were discontinued for western Washington late on Saturday as wind 
speeds dropped below 40 mph. Steady strong winds are caused by large 
horizontal pressure contrasts in the atmosphere. Extreme gusts occur 
when turbulent air motions, similar to eddies in a rushing stream, 
mix winds from aloft to the earth's surface. Winds at altitudes of 
10,000 feet, undaunted by friction, commonly exceed 50 mph, providing 
added energy for ground-level winds. Early on Sunday, a high-wind 
watch was issued, in anticipation of strong winds developing Monday.
