The husband and eight-year-old daughter of Florence Griffith Joyner 
led the world of track field Sunday in paying tribute to the late 
American sprint star. Two months after Griffith Joyner died at the 
age of 38, husband Al Joyner and daughter Mary Ruth Joyner accepted 
a special award at the annual gala of the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation. A brief documentary of FloJo's life and career, including 
interviews with her and footage of her gold medal-winning performances 
in the 100 and 200 meters at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, was broadcast 
at the ceremony. Then Joyner walked on stage hand-in-hand with his 
daughter, who was clutching a big teddy bear. Struggling to keep his 
composure, Joyner said, ``The one thing that made Florence so great 
was her class. She was a world-class person, a world-class mother 
and, most of all, a world-class friend. ``I hope people don't just 
remember the records she set. It was the love she had for the sport 
and the athletes. Her motto was, `I believe in the impossible because 
nobody else does.''' Among those in the audience were Griffith Joyner's 
former coach, Bob Kersee, and Kersee's wife, Jackie Joyner Kersee. 
It was the most poignant moment on a night when Marion Jones _ the 
second fastest sprinter in history behind Griffith Joyner _ and Ethiopian 
distance runner Haile Gebrselassie were honored as athletes of the 
year, and Joyner Kersee received a lifetime achievement award. Griffith 
Joyner, who still holds the world records in the 100 and 200, died 
at her home in California on Sept. 21. Coroner's experts said she 
suffered a seizure in her sleep _ probably triggered by a brain lesion 
_ and suffocated. Earlier Sunday, Joyner told reporters he was distressed 
at the allegations _ especially widespread in the European media _ 
that his wife's death could be linked to long-term effects of performance-enhancing 
drugs. Joyner said it took an autopsy, which found the cause of death 
was not associated with steroids or any other drugs, to prove that 
his wife's exploits on the track were clean.
