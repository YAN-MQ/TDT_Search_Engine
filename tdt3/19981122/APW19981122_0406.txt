Czech president Vaclav Havel and his wife Dagmar have sued some of 
the country's media for publishing allegations their relationship 
was in trouble, the CTK news agency reported Sunday. According to 
the report, the Havels have pressed charges against one TV station, 
two dailies and one writer for publishing stories indicating infidelity 
on the part of Havel's wife, Dagmar. In October, Czech court ruled 
to take out of circulation a book by Premysl Svora, called ``Seven 
weeks that shook the Castle''. The book was an unauthorized testimony 
of the dramatic circumstances surrounding Havel's 1996 life-threatening 
lung cancer surgery and his subsequent marriage to Dagmar, given by 
one of the doctors. The book also alleged Havel's wife Dagmar had 
an affair with her personal assistant. In the meantime the book, often 
sold under the counter, became a best-selling hit. TV Nova, the country's 
leading TV station, Blesk, the best-selling tabloid and Lidove Noviny 
published several stories along the lines of Svora's book. They were 
all sued by the Havels on Friday, CTK said, quoting Havel's press 
secretary Martin Krafl. No one was available to comment for the Havels 
on Sunday.
