Up to 2,000 immigrants, mostly from North Africa, marched through 
this southeastern Spanish town Sunday to demand better living and 
working conditions as well as an investigation into the death of a 
Moroccan worker last week. With banners bearing slogans reading ``Dignity,'' 
the march was attended by workers from the fruit and vegetable farms 
of the surrounding province of Almeria, one of Spain's most productive 
agricultural regions. The demonstration was called by the Association 
of Moroccan Workers in Spain, which has threatened to stage strikes 
unless there are developments in the case concerning the shooting 
death of Abdelkhak El Ammary on the town's outskirts on Nov. 15. Police 
said initial investigations indicate the killing may have been a settling 
of accounts between immigrants, but the workers' group believe it 
may been a case of racism. Spain has an estimated 300,000 immigrants, 
many of whom have no work or residency permits. Each year dozens of 
people enter the country illegally from North Africa. Many seek work 
in Spain while others continue on to France and other European countries.
