Finance ministers from the European Union's 11 left-leaning governments 
gather Sunday to prepare for intensified economic policy coordination 
after the launch of the euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1. 
The ministers are set to formally release a document entitled ``The 
New European Way,'' which outlines how the socialists plan to use 
their new ascendancy in the EU to make growth and job-creation the 
top economic priority. Left-of-center governments now run all but 
four of the EU's 15 nations, including the four largest - Germany, 
France, Italy and Britain. ``Our task is to find a way of marrying 
together an open, competitive and successful economy with a just and 
human society,'' says a draft of the program posted on the Internet 
by European socialist parties. ``Central is the objective of reconstructing 
a full-employment society, a society in which there are job opportunities 
for all citizens.'' The drive for closer cooperation is spearheaded 
by Germany's new finance minister Oskar Lafontaine and his French 
counterpart Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer 
Gordon Brown has lined up behind them, although Britain will be staying 
out of the euro project for now. The socialist ministers will meet 
at a Brussels hotel on the eve of the regular monthly meeting of all 
15 EU nations, the first for Lafontaine who took office after his 
Social Democratic Party won elections in September. In their nine-page 
``policy agenda'' the socialist ministers support public spending 
on infrastructure and public services as ``vital for the future of 
the prosperity of our society'' and call for ``a social contract ... 
which gives to all citizens a stake in the development of the European 
economy.'' However the document also insists tight budgets are essential 
to underpin the euro's stability. It lists ``a commitment to monetary 
stability (and) sustained fiscal discipline'' as priorities. The socialists 
call on the new European Central Bank to take account of ``growth 
and employment'' as well as inflation when its starts setting interest 
rates for the euro bloc. EU ministers will be able to repeat their 
recent calls for lower rates Monday when they are joined by Wim Duisenberg, 
the central bank's president. So far, he has been unmoved, pledging 
to use the ECB's legal independence from governments to resist political 
pressure. Despite the commitment to pool economic ideas, policy differences 
persist among the socialists. Britain has little time for French and 
Italian plans to impose shorter working weeks. The French are wary 
of British- and Dutch-style labor market flexibility. Several countries 
have doubts about French plans to raise cash for huge pan-European 
road and rail projects, and Britain rejects talk of setting EU-wide 
taxation rates. Socialist unity could be put to the test Monday, when 
ministers debate the EU budget. Germany insists it pays too much to 
the Union's coffers and wants a reluctant France and Italy to shoulder 
more of the burden.
