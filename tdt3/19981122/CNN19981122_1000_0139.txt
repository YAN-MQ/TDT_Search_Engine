Authorities say that for two years, a 20-year-old Wisconsin man drifted 
from Washington to Texas. Now, police in several jurisdictions want 
to know if he killed anybody along the way. Police say Brandon Wilson 
confessed last week to killing a 9-year-old boy in a restroom near 
San Diego. A candlelight vigil was held there yesterday. At least 
15 law enforcement agencies are trying to match Wilson's travels with 
some unsolved crimes. Among them, the murder of a 10-year-old girl 
in Salt Lake City.
