One year after his death, INXS star Michael Hutchence was remembered 
Sunday by 250 fans and family at a small chapel in the Sydney suburb 
of North Ryde. The chapel was packed with fans clutching flowers and 
cards as Hutchence's brother Rhett paid tribute, a friend read a poem, 
prayers were said and a solo saxophonist played. Hutchence's partner, 
Paula Yates, their daughter Tiger Lily and fellow INXS band members 
did not attend the service. Yates and Tiger Lily, who remained in 
London Sunday, were invited to the ceremony but did not respond, Hutchence's 
father, Kel Hutchence, said. Band members sent a wreath of flowers 
with a message that they had chosen to grieve in private. It was thought 
they attended a private memorial service with Hutchence's family earlier 
in the day. After the 40-minute service, Kel Hutchence unveiled a 
memorial in the grounds of the Northern Suburbs Memorial Gardens and 
Crematorium to mark the life of the singer who committed suicide in 
a Sydney hotel room last Nov. 22 at the age of 37. ``I just want to 
unveil this memorial and dedicate it to the memory of our beloved 
Michael,'' Kel Hutchence told fans and family. ``He was a good and 
loving man and an excellent musician.'' At the peak of his and Australian 
band INXS's musical success, 1987 album ``Kick'' sold more than 5 
million copies worldwide.
