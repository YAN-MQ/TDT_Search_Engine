The natural foods industry is predicting a season of growth. Companies 
are hoping to serve up a better year for stockholders as well as consumers. 
Charles Molineaux reports. Far from the wheat fields, harvests, natural 
food retailers such as whole foods, wild oats and general nutrition 
centers are seeking recognition in the financial field. At the natural 
products financial conference in New York, industry representatives 
predict a healthier future after a rough 1998. As long as we are delivering 
results for shareholders, they appreciate the core values and the 
social mission, but those don't carry us if we aren't delivering results. 
Last year, stocks in the Montgomery natural business average rose 
44%. But like all smaller issues, they were pummelled in the market's 
summer sell-off, and are still off 31% year to date. Now, natural 
food watchers say they are poised for a recovery. Sales have grown 
20% a year for the past five years, Buoyed by improved selection and 
growing interest from an ever broader customer base. Our customers 
have gotten more sophisticated and more conscious and more demanding, 
you can't get away with "terrible tasting but it's natural" products. 
That interest has caught the attention of major retailers. Analysts 
say it won't be long before giants like Safeway, Kroger, or even wal-Mart, 
start gobbling up natural food retailers. There's tremendous consolidation 
in food retailing right now. That's ongoing in this country. One of 
the fastest-growing areas of food retailing has been natural. Another 
area has been gourmet. There are going to be acquisitions made by 
the big food retailers in those areas, and it's just a matter of when, 
not if. Analysts say the naturals' stock prices still suffer from 
the malaise surrounding all small caps, which means their share valuations 
are compelling, and they could be ready for a healthy, small stock 
comeback. Charles Molineaux, "CNN Financial News," New York.
