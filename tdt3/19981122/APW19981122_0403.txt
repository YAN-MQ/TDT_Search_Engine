The radical rightist Republikaner voted overwhelmingly to keep their 
party chairman at a convention in Bavaria, giving him 319 of 390 delegate 
votes late Saturday, avoiding feared in-party bickering. Rolf Schlierer, 
a 43-year-old doctor and lawyer, has led the Republikaner since he 
took over from former SS Sergeant Franz Schoenhuber in 1994. He has 
attempted to gain inroads with Germany's conservative party's by steering 
a more moderate course than Schoenhuber. His deputy, 38-year-old Christian 
Kaes, the state party chairman in Baden-Wuerttemberg, and considered 
a hard-line radical rightist, surprisingly withdrew as a candidate 
against Schlierer shortly before the vote, saying he wanted to avoid 
internal bickering. Over the years Schlierer has avoided contact with 
the country's other top radical rightist party, the German People's 
Union (DVU), which won a surprising 13 percent of the vote in eastern 
Saxony Anhalt state in April. But he admitted to convention delegates 
in the Bavarian village of Felden-Hinterskirchen that he had recent 
talks with the DVU, because it presented a chance for the two parties 
to avoid competing against each other in future elections. Still he 
said the contact did not mean cooperation with the DVU. The Republikaner 
got only 1.8 percent of the vote in national elections in September, 
far less than the minimum five percent needed to gain seats in parliament. 
The DVU fared no better.
