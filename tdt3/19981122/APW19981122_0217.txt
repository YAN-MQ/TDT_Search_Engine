Officials from Japan's northern island of Hokkaido Sunday signed an 
agreement on friendship and cooperation in Russia's Far East Sakhalin 
region, a news agency said. The agreement comes at a time of thawing 
relations between Russia and Japan, whose leaders are trying to resolve 
a half-century-old dispute over the Kuril Islands, part of the Sakhalin 
region just north of Hokkaido. ``This is a remarkable event which 
is of great importance not only for the two country's neighboring 
regions, but for other territories as well,'' Sakhalin Gov. Igor Farkhutdinov 
said at a signing ceremony, the Interfax news agency reported. Farkhutdinov 
said that the implementation of offshore oil and gas projects in Sakhalin 
was a priority in establishing the cooperation pact with Hokkaido. 
``The main problem facing the Kuril Islands is the energy problem,'' 
he said. Gov. Tatsuya Hori of Hokkaido said, ``stronger good-neighborly 
ties between our territories will promote bilateral relations between 
Russia and Japan at the turn of the century.'' The agreement made 
no mention of the dispute over the Kurils, which Russia claimed after 
World War II. Japan has consistently maintained that the seizure was 
illegal.
