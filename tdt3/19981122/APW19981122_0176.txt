Lee Westwood, helped by a tree for one of his two birdies, shot a 
one-under-par 70 Sunday and won in Japan for the second consecutive 
week, taking the Dunlop Phoenix tournament by three strokes. The English 
golfer collected 45 million yen (dlrs 375,000) from a purse of 250 
million yen (dlrs 2 million) for his seventh victory of the season. 
He also won four tournaments in Europe and one in the United States. 
Westwood started Sunday's final round two strokes ahead of Darren 
Clarke of Northern Ireland. Both players made an early bogey before 
Clarke birdied the seventh, cutting the margin to one shot. Clarke 
had a chance to draw level at the eighth, but missed a 10-foot (3-meter) 
birdie putt. Westwood went ahead by two again with a birdie on the 
ninth, and by three on the 465-yard, par-4 10th, where his 4-iron 
shot headed to the left, hit a tree, and bounced on to the green. 
He sank a 50-foot (15-meter) putt for birdie. ``That was really the 
turning point,'' said Westwood. ``When the ball hits a tree and goes 
on to the green, you're lucky. As soon as something like that happens, 
you think it's going to be your day,'' he added. He finished at 13-under 
271 to 274 for Clarke, who shot a 71 Sunday and collected 22.5 million 
yen (dlrs 188,000) for second. ``My mental attitude this week was 
as good as it's ever been. It would be difficult to see how I could 
have been better around the greens,'' Westwood said. ``I don't put 
any pressure on myself,'' he said. ``I'm always happy if I win but 
I'm not bothered if I lose. Golf's not the be-all and end-all. I'm 
still earning more than the average wage.'' Westwood won the Sumitomo 
VISA Taiheiyo Masters in Japan last week and collected 21 million 
yen (dlrs 175,000) for that, giving him a total of 66 million yen 
(dlrs 550,000) for two weeks here. Japan's Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki 
shot a 72 and placed third with 276. Tied for fourth at 277 were American 
Jeff Sluman and Japan's Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki and Shigeki Maruyama. 
Sluman shot 72, ``Jumbo'' Ozaki 71 and Maruyama the day's best score 
of 67 on the 6,846-yard, par-71 Phoenix Country Club course. Defending 
champion Tom Watson of the United States shot a 72 for 294 and tied 
for 55th with Dinesh Chand of Fiji and Retief Goosen of South Africa. 
Chand shot a 71 and Goosen a 74 Sunday.
