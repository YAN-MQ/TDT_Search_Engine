A small group of demonstrators climbed into the the grounds of the 
Royal Palace in Brussels Sunday to protest against the upcoming visit 
of Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Five supporters of a Congolese 
opposition group clambered over the palace gates and ran onto the 
steps of King Albert II's official residence. They stayed for several 
minutes waving banners accusing Kabila of human rights abuse, then 
fled before police arrived. Officials at the palace refused to say 
if the monarch was inside at the time. The royal family does not usually 
spend weekends at the palace which is mostly reserved for official 
business. Belgium's RTBF television network, which filmed the protest, 
said there appeared to be no guards on duty outside. Kabila is scheduled 
to start a three-day visit to Belgium Tuesday, his first to Congo's 
former colonial ruler since he took power after toppling the late 
President Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. On Friday, a Belgian lawyer filed 
a complaint against Kabila and two top aides, saying they violated 
international law by inciting ethnic hatred against Congo's Tutsi 
minority.
