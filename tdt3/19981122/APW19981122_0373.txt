Hoping to pressure the government to back off its plans to impose 
a harsh Islamic order in Pakistan, leading opposition lawmakers on 
Sunday urged the United States to link all new aid to Islamabad to 
assurances the country will remain democratic. Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif introduced a constitutional amendment in August to scrap all 
remaining British laws in Pakistan and replace them with laws based 
on the Muslim holy book, the Koran. ``The bill ... will concentrate 
all powers into the hands of the prime minister, degrade women and 
remove all protections for ethnic and religious minorities,'' the 
opposition lawmakers said Sunday in a letter to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. The lawmakers from the Pakistan Peoples' Party told Clinton 
that any future economic assistance to Pakistan should be contingent 
on the country taking concrete steps to improve democracy, creating 
a free and impartial judiciary and allowing an unbiased investigation 
into charges of corruption and tax evasion lodged against Sharif. 
Under Sharif's regime, there has been a systematic dismantling of 
democratic institutions, they said. Sharif should not be ``rewarded 
for the abuse of power,'' they wrote. Sharif is scheduled to meet 
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Dec. 2 in Washington and ask him to 
lift the economic sanctions it imposed on Pakistan since the country's 
nuclear tests in May. The sanctions have shaken Pakistan's already 
fragile economy, forcing it to scramble to raise funds to avoid defaulting 
on debt repayment. Sharif said Saturday that the amendment was necessary 
to curb crime and guarantee swift justice. Sharif has said that he 
wants a justice system like that of the hard-line Taliban Islamic 
militia in neighboring Afghanistan.
