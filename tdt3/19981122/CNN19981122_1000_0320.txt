At least six people have been killed in Jakarta, Indonesia, during 
a clash between two religious groups. Hundreds of Muslims burned a 
Christian church and gambling hall. Rioters threw rocks at soldiers, 
who responded with warning shots and tear gas. Muslims say fighting 
broke out after a group of Christians attacked a Mosque. Last week, 
anti-government demonstrations claimed at least 16 lives.
