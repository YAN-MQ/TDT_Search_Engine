George Steinbrenner continued to deny Sunday that he had reached agreement 
or was close to an agreement to sell a majority share of the Yankees 
to Cablevision. But he made one thing perfectly plain and said another 
was possible. The plain: He and his family will retain control of 
the team if he should sell. The possible: He may wind up running the 
Knicks and Rangers, too. The possibility that Steinbrenner would take 
charge of the basketball and hockey teams, which are owned by Cablevision, 
came up earlier this year when negotiations heated up between Steinbrenner 
and Charles F. Dolan, who runs Cablevision's expanding empire. Not 
much was made of it, though, because the possibility of a sale seemed 
remote at the time. Now, however, the two men are said to be close 
to an agreement under which Long Island-based Cablevision would buy 
a majority interest in the Yankees, including most but not all of 
the 60 percent that Steinbrenner and his family own. One business 
associate of Steinbrenner, speaking last week on condition of anonymity, 
said an announcement could be forthcoming ``very early'' next year. 
In an interview Sunday, Steinbrenner flatly denied other television 
and newspaper reports that a deal had been concluded already. But 
when he was asked about the Knicks and the Rangers, should he complete 
a deal, he said, ``Don't be surprised at anything.'' Was he saying 
that an agreement would place him in charge of the other teams? ``I 
can't answer that,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He has organizations set 
up. I don't want to ruffle anyone's feelings.'' But, he added, ``Anything 
can happen.'' What Steinbrenner did not equivocate on was the subject 
of control of the Yankees in the event of a sale. ``If it is done,'' 
he said by telephone from Tampa, ``the Steinbrenners will be in control. 
That's what sets Cablevision apart from others. There are those who 
would pay a lot of money and take control, but that won't happen. 
We've been in control for too long.'' How long would he and his family 
run the Yankees? ``It would have to be a long-term deal,'' he said. 
Business associates of the owner said that in his negotiations with 
Dolan, Steinbrenner had already established that element of the potential 
deal. But Steinbrenner cautioned that no one should ``get too far 
out'' on the idea that a sale is imminent. He said he could not say 
at what stage his talks with Dolan stood, but he added: ``There are 
other people who as a result of this story have called. Two calls 
came today from other places.'' He declined to say who had called. 
Whether it is done or close, a deal now seems inevitable for the first 
time in the 26-year ownership of Steinbrenner and his limited partners. 
An associate of one of the partners has said that the partners might 
be the only delaying factor. The limited partners, the associate said 
on condition of anonymity, have balked at the way the revenue from 
the sale would be divided. Steinbrenner said it was ``a bit too early 
for conjecture'' on how that issue or any other would be resolved.
