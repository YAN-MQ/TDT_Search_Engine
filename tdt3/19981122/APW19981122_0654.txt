A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed early Sunday in an upscale entertainment 
district of Bogota, authorities said. Frank Arnold Moreno was shot 
once in the chest outside a bar in the city's the so-called Zona Rosa 
about 1 a.m., officials said. Moreno, who had been in Colombia for 
about a year, was not with any other Drug Enforcement Administration 
agents at the time, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. Moreno was in his early 30s and had previously been assigned 
to Oklahoma City, the official said. The bullet went through Moreno's 
chest, the official said. ``Everyone is working really hard investigating 
it.'' The official would not say whether Moreno was involved in an 
undercover drug investigation at the time of the killing, which occurred 
in a neighborhood of restaurants, bars and discotheques that is packed 
with people well after midnight on weekends. DEA chief spokesman Van 
Quarles in Washington said he did not have information about Moreno's 
age, hometown or duties with the agency. The DEA has an estimated 
50 agents in Colombia, the world's leading producer and exporter of 
cocaine.
