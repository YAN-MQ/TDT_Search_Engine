Jordan and Syria ended talks Sunday on sharing Yarmouk River water 
by agreeing to avoid steps that might jeopardize plans to build a 
dam at Jordan's northern border with Syria, Water Minister Hani Mulqi 
said. The Jordanian-Syrian committee, which opened its two-day meeting 
Saturday, discussed Jordanian complaints about more ditches being 
dug on Yarmouk tributaries in Syria, which reduce Jordan's water share 
by nearly half, Mulqi said. He said Syria has set up more than 30 
ditches and pumping facilities to draw water along the Yarmouk river, 
dropping the flow of water from 470 million cubic meters to 270 million 
cubic meters yearly in the border area. If such measures are halted, 
Mulqi said, it would be feasible to build the al-Wiheh dam near the 
border. A Jordanian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
said the government intends to secure funds from Arab and international 
sources for the 400 million dinar (dlrs 563 million) dam, which would 
hold 225 million cubic meters of water. The meeting was the fourth 
since October 1997, when both sides agreed to go ahead with plans 
to build the dam in accordance with a 1987 agreement. The Yarmouk 
begins in Syria, flows along the Syrian-Jordanian border and then 
joins the Jordan River downstream from Lake Tiberias in northeast 
Israel. Jordan also is developing water-sharing plans with Israel, 
but does not expect these to interfere with joint projects with Syria 
such as the al-Wihdeh dam. According to official statistics, Jordan's 
growing population _ now estimated at 4.2 million _ will need 1.2 
billion cubic meters of water annually in 1998-2000. The country's 
present resources provide only 960 million cubic meters per year.
