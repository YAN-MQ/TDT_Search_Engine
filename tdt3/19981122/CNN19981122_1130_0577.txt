A scientist has unearthed an object he says could be part of the killer 
rock that wiped out dinosaurs millions of years ago. Rick Lockridge 
has the story. This tiny sliver of rock, much smaller than your fingernail, 
doesn't look too dangerous. But the scientist who found it says it 
was once part of the biggest killer the world has ever seen. I've 
found a piece of this object that impacted the earth 65 million years 
ago, and it's a piece big enough to analyze, to study and discuss. 
If Frank kyte is right, you're looking at a piece of a Ten-kilometer-wide 
asteroid that struck Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, altering the earth's 
climate and wiping out most of the animal species on the planet. Kyte 
says the tiny iridium and iron chip could only have come from an asteroid, 
not a Comet. And he says that should end an ongoing debate over which 
of those two objects killed off T-Rex and all of his friends. Comets 
are very icy objects, that's why they emit vapors when they get close 
to the sun. And asteroids are rocky. The data support the probability 
that it is from an asteroid instead of from a Comet. The impact of 
the giant rock gave the earth shakes and a fever. Earthquakes, volcanoes 
and skies full of dust. A hothouse effect kicked in. The dinosaurs 
couldn't take the heat. Kyte found his piece of the rock under the 
seabed thousands of miles from the point of impact. Embedded in a 
layer of fine dust, he says it was easy to spot. It's 1,000 times 
bigger than the typical grains of sediment it was deposited in. If 
other scientists can support kyte's contention that this was the rock 
that changed the world, it'll be a defeat for the many scientists 
who still hold to other theories, and a final postscript for the dinosaurs. 
They were big, but the asteroid was bigger. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
