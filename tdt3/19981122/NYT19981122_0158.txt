Five goals is almost a week's worth of production for the Devils, 
so no one could blame the team for celebrating in the dressing room 
after a 5-2 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes on Sunday afternoon. 
``It was the best team effort this year by far,'' Bobby Holik said 
after the Devils scored three goals in the third period in their most 
productive performance of the season. ``Everyone contributed. We went 
after them from the start, and we knew what we wanted.'' Holik scored 
the Devils' second goal, giving them the lead, and Jay Pandolfo, Randy 
McKay, Denis Pederson and Scott Stevens also had goals. The Devils 
have lost only once in their last six games and improved to 11-6-1, 
putting them on top of the Atlantic Division standing. Holik, Coach 
Robbie Ftorek and other players said it was important that the Devils 
skated away with a victory in the first of five straight games on 
the road. The team will continue on to Dallas, Phoenix and Denver 
this week before concluding the trip in Washington on Dec. 1. ``It's 
always nice to get a `W' in the first game on the road,'' Ftorek said. 
``The guys are working hard and shooting the puck.'' Holik and Stevens 
worked perhaps the hardest and were the most effective players for 
the Devils _ Holik for banging people against the boards all afternoon, 
and Stevens for his confrontations with Keith Primeau, the captain 
of the Hurricanes. ``I didn't like his elbow,'' Stevens said of Primeau. 
``It bothers me when you get an elbow on the power play and it's not 
called. I was upset. I don't understand why a guy 6-4 has to use his 
elbow.'' Both benches must have noticed the physical and verbal confrontations 
between the two captains. Stevens came out with the final blow, scoring 
an empty-net goal with Primeau on the ice. ``It's nice to punish a 
guy with an empty-netter,'' he said. Stevens earned his 300th assist 
for the Devils on a goal by Holik, who gave Stevens plenty of credit. 
``Scott pinched in well, and I was able to outmuscle the defenseman,'' 
Holik said of his third goal of the season. But Holik's performance 
was highlighted by a hit on Ron Francis that angered the Hurricanes. 
``I felt I needed to get more involved,'' Holik said. ``If everyone 
on their bench is after me, it means I'm playing well.'' Holik's goal 
gave the Devils a 2-1 lead after Carolina's Ray Sheppard had opened 
the scoring early in the first and Pandolfo had tied it with his fifth 
goal early in the second. Nelson Emerson tied the score for the Hurricanes 
2 minutes 22 seconds into the third, before McKay scored his fifth 
goal of the season just over four minutes later by flipping a back-hander 
from the slot. Pederson extended the lead with a 25-foot shot past 
Arturs Irbe at 11:43. Stevens sealed the victory with six seconds 
left after the Hurricanes pulled goaltender Irbe for an extra attacker. 
Irbe faced 39 shots and could not be blamed for any of the goals. 
The Devils' Martin Brodeur faced 28 shots.
