Cnnsi's Tom verducci has learned that the reported sale of the New 
York yankees by owner George Steinbrenner to cablevision for roughly 
$600 million, is not yet a done deal. Cablevision already owns Madison 
square garden, the rangers and the Knicks. The deal will most likely 
be completed after the new year, and it would be the richest deal 
ever for a sports team in the United States. Steinbrenner would continue 
to run the team.
