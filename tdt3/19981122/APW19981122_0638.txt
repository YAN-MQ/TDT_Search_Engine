Championship leader Tommy Makinen handed rival Carlos Sainz a big 
chance to take the world title in the final race of the season Sunday 
when he skidded out on day one of the Network Q rally of Britain. 
The Finn, who led the Spaniard by two points going into the three-day 
race around England and Wales, skidded on a patch of oil on stage 
five, hit a concrete barrier and the impact ripped the right rear 
wheel from his Mitsubishi Lancer. Forced the drop out of the race, 
Makinen, who was aiming for a third world title in a row, was left 
to wait to see how Sainz performed. The Spaniard, driving a Toyota 
Corolla, needed to finish fourth or higher to take the world title 
for the third time although first since 1992. Makinen was convinced 
he had thrown the title away. ``It happened on the first left-hand 
bend. There was black stuff on the surface and it just threw me completely,'' 
the Finn said of the accident. ``I am very upset, I have thrown the 
championship away.'' After 11 of the 14 stages on day one, Sainz placed 
second to another for world titlist, Colin McRae, who led the Spaniard 
by 4.6 seconds in a Subaru Impreza.
