Congo President Laurent Kabila opened his first official European 
visit since taking power last year, coming to Italy on Sunday for 
a 3-day stop that will include a meeting with Pope John Paul II. Kabila 
is moving to boost international credibility of his government, which 
is fighting a 3-month-old war against rebels backed by some of Congo's 
neighbors. ``We are going to meet with men of the world to relate 
to them Congo's experiences,'' he told reporters before flying out 
of the Congo capital of Kinshasa on Sunday morning. Kabila is headed 
to a French-African summit in Paris on Thursday. In Italy, he meets 
Tuesday with the pope and Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 
The Roman Catholic Church's Sant' Egidio community is trying to arrange 
peace talks between Kabila and the rebels, as it has managed in other 
conflicts worldwide. Kabila has ruled out talks with rebels. Kabila 
came to power in May 1997 after leading a rebellion that overthrew 
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He now is confronted by a force composed 
of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and opposition 
politicians who accuse Kabila of corruption, mismanagement and stirring 
up ethnic rivalries. (ek)
