The only name that used to count in Schenectady was General Electric. 
Now the new names to reckon with are Roger and Neil. As in: ``Not 
much happened until Roger and Neil got together.'' That is what George 
L. Robertson, president of the Schenectady Economic Development Corp., 
said. And, ``Now Roger and Neil have stepped up to the plate, and 
we're beginning to hit a lot of singles, and that's what we need _ 
a lot of singles, instead of the home run that many of the town fathers 
were looking for.'' That comes from David Oliker, president and chief 
executive of MVP Health Plan Inc., a 300,000-member health maintenance 
organization with headquarters here. Roger is Roger H. Hull, president 
of Union College, and Neil is Neil M. Golub, president of Price Chopper 
supermarkets. The college president and the grocery magnate have emerged 
as a two-man urban redevelopment team determined to revive this decaying 
factory town of 65,000. Schenectady has been struggling since the 
early 1960s when General Electric began moving 30,000 jobs to other 
cities. Hull said that when he came to Schenectady, the business community 
wanted to get people to shop downtown again, a short-term fix he said 
did not address underlying economic problems. Hull and Golub have 
stunned Schenectady with an ambitious plan to build an eight-screen 
movie theater, a 50,000-square-foot trade show center, a new hotel 
and a combination bus and train station to greet the high-speed trains 
that will arrive from New York City. They even got Gov. George Pataki 
to promise $22 million for the construction of a new state office 
building downtown for the Department of Transportation, which will 
bring an estimated 5,500 new jobs to the city. The two men are unalike 
in many ways. Golub, 61, is a blunt businessman and a prominent Republican 
in upstate New York. Hull, 56, is a liberal on many issues and his 
sentences often lapse into an academic indirection. Golub is a golfer 
and philanthropist. Hull is devoted to tae kwon do and running. The 
two began working together from the moment they met in 1991, when 
Hull arrived to head Union College. ``Our personalities may be very 
different,'' Hull said, ``but at the same time, we're both optimists, 
and we believe we can get things done.'' Golub agreed. ``Roger always 
has ideas,'' he said. ``He's always able to lay out the options and 
ask, `Where are we going and where do we want to be in 20 years?' 
Roger is in a business where you've got to make things happen, and 
I'm in a business where you've got to make things happen.'' Golub's 
father, William, had also been concerned with the city's future, and 
when he died, he left his son $1 million to use for the betterment 
of the city. With the money, Golub and Hull formed Schenectady 2000, 
a civic group that fosters improvement programs, in 1992. They hired 
an urban planner to conduct a survey of the city's best features _ 
the riverfront, the old Stockade brownstone district, the college, 
the Proctor's Theater _ and devise a way to revitalize them. Next 
they looked for investment to help the city shine again. Pataki helped 
by creating the Metroplex Development Authority, which will receive 
$50 million in bonds to spend in the city and the county. That the 
revival of downtown has been spearheaded by a college president and 
a supermarket president stands in sharp contrast to the way things 
used to work around here. ``This was a company town _ G.E. ran the 
town,'' said Robertson. ``Even in the 1970s, every not-for-profit 
board had a GE executive on it, and before anything was decided, everybody 
turned their eyes down to the end of the table to see what GE wanted 
to do.'' How far Schenectady has to march is apparent in how far it 
has fallen. After World War II and into the 1950s, General Electric 
had 35,000 employees in the city and county _ one of every two working 
people. Today, General Electric's downtown turbine works employs about 
6,000, and another round of departures was announced last spring. 
Behind the employment vacuum, Schenectady's urban woes come flooding 
in. ``We had the second highest violent crime rate in 1996 in the 
state of New York,'' said Robert T. Farley, a member of the County 
Legislature. But while Hull and Golub acknowledge that Schenectady 
has a long way to go before it even approaches its past prosperity, 
Golub said he was no longer going to worry about opponents. ``We are 
going to drag them kicking and screaming into the 21st century,'' 
he said.
