We'll preview today's NFL action, next in "Headline Sports." When 
you had the idea, you were just a kid. But lately, you've had to buy 
into some pretty adult stuff... like strategies for attracting and 
retaining the best employees... and maximizing shareholder value. 
At Arthur Andersen, we help people make those kinds of decisions... 
which lets them concentrate on things like transforming... complex 
three-dimensional objects into simple digital data. You know... kid's 
stuff. n Stay tuned and we'll tell you after sports. The raiders out 
to make an impression on Denver. I'm Anthony Keith James and this 
is "CNN Headline Sports."
