Hillary Rodham Clinton visited U.S.-supported hospitals in Haiti Sunday, 
one of the few encouraging signs in a country rescued by the United 
States from dictatorship but not from poverty. Mrs. Clinton was winding 
up a tour of hurricane-ravaged Central American and Caribbean countries 
where she promised more disaster relief. She left for home later Sunday. 
In Haiti, she announced the United States would add another dlrs 2.1 
million to a dlrs 12 million storm relief package. But she focused 
her visit on health care in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western 
Hemisphere. Mrs. Clinton toured the Bienfaisance Hospital in Pignon, 
a small northern farming town of 20,000 people, and complimented the 
facilities more than 500 midwives for saving mothers' lives. ``What 
you're doing is very important,'' she said. In Pignon, only 190 of 
every 100,000 mothers die in childbirth, much lower than the national 
rate of 456 per 100,000. The United States gives the program dlrs 
700,000 a year. Also enthusiastic about the program was farmer Dereus 
Marcellus, who was among more than 100 residents who greeted Mrs. 
Clinton. Marcellus, 33, said his wife died several years ago while 
giving birth to their seventh child, who also died. ``The hospital 
was going to teach us family planning. It was too late,'' he said. 
``His case is typical. That's why we need to move medical education 
out of the capital and into the countryside,'' said Dr. Arthur Fournier, 
professor of family medicine at the University of Miami School of 
Medicine, which will provide technical assistance to a new medical 
education program. The dlrs 1 million pilot phase, with Bienfaisance 
Hospital as its center, will be also financed by a foundation of George 
Soros.
