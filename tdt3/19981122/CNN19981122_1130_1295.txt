College football, the big three undefeated teams stayed that way. 
The new associated press poll, Tennessee should stay on top. Number 
one Tennessee walloped an emotionally spent Kentucky squad. The Vols 
clinched the S.E.C. east with a 59-21 win. Kansas state extended its 
winning streak to 19 games. Michael Bishop led the Wildcats to a 31-25 
victory over number 19 Missouri. UCLA's winning streak is at 20 games, 
the longest run in the nation. The Bruins beat crosstown rivals USC 
for the eighth consecutive time. 34-17, the final. Don't count Florida 
state out of the national title picture. A 23-12 win over hated rival 
Florida. The seminoles extend their home unbeaten streak to 40 games.
