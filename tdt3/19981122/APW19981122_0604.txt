Israeli warplanes raided suspected guerrilla hideouts in southern 
Lebanon Sunday, security officials said. One Israeli jet fired an 
air-to-surface missile on a valley between the Shiite Muslim villages 
of Zibqine and Jibal al-Boutoum, the Lebanese officials said, speaking 
on customary condition of anonymity. The valley, near the southern 
port of Tyre, is believed to be used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a 
base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese 
militiamen occupying a border enclave in south Lebanon. There was 
no word on casualties from the 7.30 a.m. (5:30 GMT) airstrike, the 
latest in a series of raids by Israeli warplanes on suspected bases 
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group. In Jerusalem, an 
Israeli army spokesman confirmed the raid, saying warplanes attacked 
``terrorist targets'' in south Lebanon. Israel routinely uses the 
word ``terrorist'' to describe the guerrillas fighting its occupation 
of south Lebanon. On Friday, Israeli warplanes and artillery attacked 
suspected guerrilla hideouts, 23 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of 
Tyre, following a series of clashes in the south that reportedly left 
four guerrillas dead. Hezbollah on Sunday issued a statement announcing 
the death of one of its fighters, Ghassan Zaatar, 26, in Friday's 
clashes. The three other dead guerrillas reportedly belonged to the 
Syrian-backed Amal group. Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected 
Hezbollah bases in the south almost daily since Nov. 8. None of the 
raids resulted in casualties. The air raids come at a time of heightened 
tension in south Lebanon. On Monday, a Hezbollah roadside bomb killed 
three Israeli soldiers and wounded four others, two seriously. The 
casualties were the highest Israeli losses in more than a year. Hezbollah, 
or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to try to oust 1,500 
Israeli troops and the 2,500 allied militiamen from the zone which 
Israel set up in 1985. It maintains the occupation is necessary to 
shield its northern towns against cross-border attacks.
