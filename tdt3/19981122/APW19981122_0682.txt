An expert investigating the car crash that killed Princess Diana said 
in a report that the Alma traffic tunnel poses a serious danger to 
motorists, a judicial source said Sunday. The report said it is ``unthinkable'' 
that a security barrier has never been put up in the tunnel, where 
Diana was fatally injured Aug. 31, 1997, according to the source, 
who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Since 
the tunnel was first used in 1956, the report said, eight people have 
been killed and eight others injured in a total of 34 accidents in 
the right bank underpass. Those figures don't include the 1997 crash, 
which also killed Diana's boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and the car's driver, 
Henri Paul, who was legally drunk at the time. The only survivor was 
bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones. The report into possible causes of the 
crash, which was given to the judge investigating the accident earlier 
this month, also lays out a series of scenarios that could have led 
to the wreck. It is possible, the report says, that the Mercedes in 
which Diana was riding was blocked by one or more motorcycles driven 
by photographers, forcing the car to enter the tunnel. Under this 
scenario, Paul could have lost control immediately upon entering the 
tunnel, according to the report. The report, compiled by Michel Nibodeau, 
an automobile expert, also said that Paul could have put the car in 
neutral just before the final impact, contributing to the car's loss 
of control. Witnesses have reported hearing a revving noise just before 
the Mercedes entered the tunnel, supporting that theory. The report 
was one of a series given to Judge Herve Stephan as he tries to wrap 
up his investigation. Now, parties to the case can request further 
probes. Previous tests have also confirmed that the Mercedes brushed 
against a Fiat Uno before crashing, but it is not known what role 
that played in the crash. Investigators have been unable to trace 
the Uno or its driver. The main causes of the crash are still believed 
to be drunkenness and speed. The outcome of the judge's investigation 
will be important in determining the fate of 10 photographers who 
are still under formal investigation. It is believed they will be 
cleared on the manslaughter charge, but some may be tried on the charge 
of failing to aid people in danger.
