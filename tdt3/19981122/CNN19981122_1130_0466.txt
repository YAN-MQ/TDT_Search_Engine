Tonight, "60 minutes" will air portions of a controversial tape sent 
to CBS by retired pathologist Jack Kevorkian. The tape shows Kevorkian 
giving a lethal injection to a man who suffered from Lou Gehrig's 
disease. Kevorkian says he assisted in the suicide September 17th 
at the man's detroit home. Kevorkian claims he has assisted in more 
than 120 deaths since 1990. Despite a Michigan law against assisted 
suicide, a county prosecutor says he won't rush to bring charges. 
Kevorkian has been acquitted in three trials. A fourth ended in a 
mistrial.
