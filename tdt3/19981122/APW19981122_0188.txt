French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, recovering from 
a week-long coma brought on by an allergic reaction to anesthesia, 
says he will return to his post ``in the coming weeks.'' Appearing 
Saturday evening at a film festival in Belfort, in eastern France, 
Chevenement said his convalescence was progressing on schedule. ``God 
didn't want me, but the devil didn't either, so I came back,'' Chevenement 
said. Chevenement's heart stopped for nearly an hour Sept. 2 after 
he was administered curare, a muscle relaxant known to cause allergic 
reactions in some patients, just ahead of planned gall bladder surgery. 
He spent eight days in a coma. The French press had painted a grim 
picture of the chances of full recovery for the 59-year-old Chevenement. 
But doctors said the minister would suffer ``neither physical nor 
neurological aftereffects.'' Chevenement is a key figure in Socialist 
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Cabinet. He has held several ministry 
portfolios in previous governments, including industry, education 
and defense. He resigned as defense minister in 1991 to protest France's 
involvement in the Gulf War. As interior minister, he is responsible 
for the nation's police and security forces.
