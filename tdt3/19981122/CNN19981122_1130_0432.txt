In Chicago, an African-American woman has been convicted of trying 
to defraud the united parcel service by scrawling racial epithets 
on packages and sending them to herself and nationally known black 
leaders. Angela Jackson of St. Paul, Minnesota, could be sentenced 
to more than five years in prison. She was found guilty of using U.P.S. 
to send 28 pieces of hate mail to herself and representatives Jesse 
Jackson Jr. and Bobby rush. She then tried to collect $150,000 from 
U.P.S., saying white supremacists at the company had vandalized her 
insured packages.
