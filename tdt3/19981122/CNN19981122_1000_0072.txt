A Michigan prosecutor says a videotape showing Dr. Jack Kevorkian 
giving a Man a lethal drug dose might not be enough to convict him 
of assisted suicide. A Michigan law banning assisted suicide took 
effect September 1st. Kevorkian told "60 minutes" the man died on 
September 17th. He had Lou Gehrig's disease. The prosecutor says he 
won't rush to bring charges against Kevorkian, who has been acquitted 
of assisted suicide charges in three trials. A fourth ended with a 
mistrial.
