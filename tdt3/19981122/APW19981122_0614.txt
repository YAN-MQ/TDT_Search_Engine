Israeli warplanes raided suspected guerrilla hideouts in southern 
Lebanon Sunday, security officials said. One Israeli jet fired an 
air-to-surface missile on a valley between the Shiite Muslim villages 
of Zibqine and Jibal al-Boutoum, the Lebanese officials said, speaking 
on customary condition of anonymity. The valley, near the southern 
port of Tyre, is believed to be used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a 
base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese 
militiamen occupying a border enclave in south Lebanon. There was 
no word on casualties from the 7.30 a.m. (5:30 GMT) airstrike, the 
latest in a series of raids by Israeli warplanes on suspected bases 
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group. In Jerusalem, an 
Israeli army spokesman confirmed the raid, saying warplanes attacked 
``terrorist targets'' in south Lebanon. Israel routinely uses the 
word ``terrorist'' to describe the guerrillas fighting its occupation 
of south Lebanon. Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla 
war to try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500 allied militiamen 
from the zone that Israel set up in 1985. It maintains the occupation 
is necessary to shield its northern towns against cross-border attacks.
