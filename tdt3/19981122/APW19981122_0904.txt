Finland's Hannu Manninen won the season-opening World Cup Nordic combined 
event Sunday. Manninen, the leader after Saturday's jumping phase 
of the competition, started 2 minutes, 27 seconds ahead of Norway's 
Bjarte Engen Vik and 2:39 ahead of American Todd Lodwick in Sunday's 
15-kilometer cross-country race. Nordic combined scoring translates 
jump points into a time deficit to determine the starting positions 
for the next day's race. Manninen ranked only 11th in the cross-country 
race but his big start margin gave him plenty of cushion and he won 
by a combined 2:21.5. Vike was second, 1:11 ahead of Lodwick. Lodwick, 
a three-time Nordic combined winner, got his ninth career podium finish. 
Jumping was the key for Lodwick, who earned 229.5 jump points after 
some lackluster efforts during training. The podium placing for last 
year's fourth-place finisher in the overall standings ``sends a message 
to the other guys that I'm serious.'' Alexei Fadeev of Russia placed 
fourth, the same position he held after the jumps. The biggest move 
was made by Norway's Trond Einar Elden, who was only 31st on the jump 
hill. He was fastest in the 15K in 35.32.9 to climb into fifth in 
the final scoring. Tim Tetreault, like Lodwick a resident of Steamboat 
Springs, Colo., was 46th in the 50-skier field in jumping and stayed 
in that position after placing 35th in the cross-country race. He 
was 9:44.2 behind the winner.
