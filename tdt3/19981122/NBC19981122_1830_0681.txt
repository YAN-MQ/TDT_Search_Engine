To the war on smoking now, and the huge historic deal to be signed 
tomorrow by the cigarette companies. It ends the industry's battle 
with the states, but big tobacco still has big problems. NBC's Stan 
Bernard examines the agreement. Teenage smoking was the driving issue 
in the $206 billion agreement between the tobacco industry and 46 
states. It's addictive. I want to quit. I'm going to quit. But right 
now, it's just hard. The payout to 46 states over the next 25 years 
could mean a quick price increase, maybe 40 cents a pack. Will price 
have an impact on smokers? Depends on how much it goes up. If it goes 
too high, I'm going to say it will affect it. I'm going to smoke them 
as long as I can afford to buy them. In addition to putting billions 
in state treasuries, marketing of tobacco on billboards will end. 
No more premium giveaways, such as clothes and gifts with tobacco 
logos. Some restrictions on tobacco sponsorship of sporting events. 
But advertising in stores and magazines will continue. The agreement 
does not effect this ongoing class action lawsuit in Florida where 
the plaintiffs are sick smokers who say the tobacco industry lied 
to them about the dangers of smoking. A state attorney general who 
led the fight for the agreement sees it is only a first step. This 
case is about saving lives. There's no greater calling for me than 
making a quality of life better for adults and saving kids' lives. 
The tobacco industry has restricted its comments on the agreement 
to press releases: We realize that we have to maintain our commitment, 
by our actions as well as our words, to do something about the problems 
surrounding tobacco, most especially the youth-smoking issue. With 
this agreement anti-smoking forces are now looking to congress to 
give the FDA a role in reducing nicotine. Stan Bernard, NBC news, 
New York.
