Whether you want to go coast to coast, or take a transcontinental 
jaunt, you can find great travel bargains this holiday season. Stephanie 
Oswald has more in this edition of "working ahead." 'tis the season 
for travel deals that take you away -- or closer to home -- for the 
holidays. Most airlines offer "Turkey" fares. Fly out on the Monday 
before Thanksgiving, or even on Thanksgiving day, and return Friday 
or Saturday. Avoiding the peak travel days of the Wednesday before 
and the Sunday after thanksgiving can mean real savings. For example, 
some airlines offer one-way fares as low as $19, or roundtrip fares 
around $100. Many airline web sites have specials you can't get anywhere 
else. And American airlines is now offering a new special every day 
leading up to the holidays. It's also off-season in Europe. Crowds 
are gone and hotels are affordable. Roundtrip fares between major 
U.S. and European cities are typically less than $500 per person. 
We've seen airfares for as low as $179 each way from the east coast 
to major European cities for travel between November 1st and March 
31st, and many hotel deals to match. Now's the time for hotel holiday 
packages. Major chains offer weekend deals teamed with holiday shopping 
or event promotions. Look for rates of $89 or less per room. Many 
packages include free breakfast, transportation to nearby stores and 
discounts on shopping. If you can't get away for Thanksgiving, look 
for similar travel bargains around Christmas and new year's. Stephanie 
Oswald, CNN, reporting.
