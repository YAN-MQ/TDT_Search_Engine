Another controversy has grown out of Ken Starr's investigation, this 
one focusing on the investigator himself. The law that created the 
position of independent counsel will soon be up for renewal. And many 
people are starting to question the wisdom of even having one. Here's 
ABC's Tim O'Brien. Ken Starr's investigation of Bill Clinton has gone 
on for more than four years and has cost more than $40 million. Citing 
that as evidence of a good idea gone bad, a committee of the american 
bar association, once the staunchest defender of the independent counsel 
law, voted this weekend to oppose it. There is no ending until the 
independent counsel says it's over. And there's no budget limits, 
there's no time limits, and there's really no supervision. The independent 
counsel law grew out of Watergate and is aimed at preventing any recurrence 
of the infamous "Saturday night massacre" when President Richard Nixon 
fired special prosecutor archibald Cox. But when Cox and his former 
colleagues commemorated the 25th anniversary of the "Saturday night 
massacre" in Washington last month, even Cox said he had misgivings 
about the law and how it may be used as a political weapon. Treating 
the act as a partisan political tool has grown. Cox and his Watergate 
successors had been appointed by the attorney general under justice 
department regulations. Starr was appointed by a special federal court 
under the independt counsel law, which gave him far more insulation 
from White House pressure than Cox enjoyed -- insulation defenders 
of the law say is essential to avoid the appearance of conflict. I 
think that it is important not to throw the baby out of the bath water, 
but to see what the problems are and to make modifications to a statute, 
which has, at its core, a good concept. Congress must act by the end 
of June to renew the independent counsel law. If it does nothing, 
one of the major legacies of the impeachment proceedings against Richard 
Nixon becomes one of the major casualties of the case against Bill 
Clinton. Tim O'Brien, ABC News, Washington.
