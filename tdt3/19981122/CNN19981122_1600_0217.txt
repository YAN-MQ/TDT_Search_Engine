A group of expatriate north Koreans recently returned for a visit 
for the first time since leaving. Sohn jie-Ae has their story. 78-year-old 
Lee Jong-sung cried out for her mother and father, parents she left 
behind in north Korea during the Korean war. She never saw or heard 
from them again. Assuming they are dead, she and her family pay their 
respects, for the first time in the north. Many former north Koreans 
like Lee joined the first south Korean tour to the north's scenic 
kumkang mountain. I'm sad thinking about my hometown in the north. 
Others were more upbeat. Now that I've seen the north again, I can 
die in peace. The tourists tasted north Korean icicles, seaweed and 
saw beautiful scenery near the tense border between the two Koreas. 
These tourists wandering the beaches are seeing their country for 
the first time through north Korean eyes. And feeling the tensions 
between the two Koreas. The south Korean tourists were banned from 
talking to north Koreans. And kilometers and kilometers of barbed 
wire lined the road used by the tour buses. But at the end of the 
five-day tour, the rules seemed to bend. The tourists started interacting 
with the north Koreans who were sent to make sure the rules were being 
followed. First, there were the occasional handshakes. Then a bit 
of casual conversation, and finally even a song of welcome from the 
north Korean hosts. Overall, both sides seemed to come away with a 
feeling that there may be happier days ahead. Sohn jie-Ae, CNN, kumkang 
mountain, north Korea.
