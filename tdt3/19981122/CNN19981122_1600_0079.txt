Some congressmen say the time for diplomacy has come and gone several 
times over, and the United States should attack Iraq now. Delaware 
senator Joseph Biden says Iraq's latest defiance shows once and for 
all that the United States shouldn't waste any more time with Saddam 
hussein. Iraq contends it is complying fully with the U.N. team. After 
the recent crisis fabricated by the United States of America and britain, 
which again threatened the region with destruction, we are seeing 
that ambassador Butler is barraging Iraq with demands of imaginary 
documents. It's apparent last week that Saddam is not going to cooperate. 
Iraq wants to retain these weapons of mass destruction, sort of the 
reason for being of Saddam. He is not only a dictator who has the 
potential to produce these weapons, but the political will to use 
them. President Clinton says the United States should not overreact, 
but says the U.S. is prepared to carry out an attack if the U.N. team 
concludes Iraq is not complying.
