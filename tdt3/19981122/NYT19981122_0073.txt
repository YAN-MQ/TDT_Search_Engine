How would you promote a television show called ``10'' that visits 
the beaches of Miami seeking the best-looking guys and girls and lets 
audiences vote for their favorites? Well, if you work for WAMI, Barry 
Diller's new television station in Miami, and it is the Thanksgiving 
season, you create a commercial that scans bikinied bodies while a 
voiceover says that ``10'' offers ``all the breasts, legs and thighs 
you can handle.'' Executives at WAMI (pronounced whammy) like to refer 
to the show as an ``egalitarian, populist beauty pageant.'' The WAMI 
approach to local television also includes ``Ken's Freakquency,'' 
a midnight tour of the outre _ replete with body paint, snakes and 
nose rings _ that derives its name from the R.E.M. song ``What's the 
Frequency, Kenneth?'' And then there is the nightly 11 o'clock newscast 
``Lips,'' consisting solely of a woman's rouged mouth reading headlines 
in a sultry voice. So it goes in the latest television test kitchen 
of Diller, the man whose career highlights include building the Fox 
Network in the 1980s on the risque (``Married ... With Children'') 
and the tabloid (``A Current Affair'') and introducing the world to 
cubic zirconium through the QVC home-shopping channel. Now Diller, 
as part of the work of his sprawling video empire, has turned his 
commercially astute, if sometimes jaundiced, eye to the world of local 
television. WAMI, channel 69 in Miami, is one of 13 television stations 
owned by USA Networks Inc., of which Diller is chairman. The company 
also includes the cable service USA Networks, a television production 
operation called Studios USA, the Sci-Fi Channel, Home Shopping Network, 
Ticketmaster and Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch. For the first nine 
months of this year, the company had profits of $26 million on revenue 
of $1.87 billion. Since USA Networks converted WAMI from a Home Shopping 
Network affiliate in June, the Miami station appears to have become 
an experiment in redefining local TV in the era of video diversity. 
Industrywide, local television advertiser spending has been perking 
along at an impressive pace and is expected to grow 4 percent next 
year, to a total of $12.5 billion. But analysts point out that the 
explosion of national and regional cable services and broadcast networks 
makes it harder than ever for an individual local station to make 
its voice heard. Currently, for example, there are 173 national cable 
services, compared with only 79 in 1990. And so WAMI's oddball melange 
of shows reflects the challenge of creating any new service in an 
increasingly competitive environment _ particularly on a low budget. 
Starting new programming services ``is always done in an unfriendly 
environment,'' Diller said. ``It is like bouncing off the side walls 
of a squash court,'' he said. ``It's like constant carom shots, and 
you find your way like a fool. And each year, as fragmentation continues, 
it certainly gets more difficult.'' Not all of WAMI's local programming 
is camp or farce. For example, ``The Times,'' a half-hour early-evening 
newscast somewhat more conventional than the 11 p.m. ``Lips,'' investigated 
the 16-year prison term for armed robbery that had been served by 
a Cuban national, Alberto Alfonso. The original sentence had been 
13 years, but he remained behind bars because the United States does 
not have an agreement with Cuba that would have allowed him to be 
sent home at the end of his sentence. After the program was broadcast, 
Alfonso was eventually freed and The Miami Herald cited WAMI's role 
in bringing his case to light. WAMI also broadcasts ``City Desk: The 
Herald,'' a documentary-style program that tracks Miami Herald reporters 
on the job. Diller's decision to focus anew on the local broadcast 
audience is something of a departure from the television industry 
trend in recent years. Virtually all new programming efforts over 
the last decade have focused on cable services, with their enviable 
ability to attract both national advertising and fees from local cable 
operators. But Diller's theory is that local broadcast programming 
has been ignored and that people want a sense of what is going on 
in their local communities. WAMI is situated smack in the heart of 
Miami's trendy South Beach section, in a glass-walled studio in the 
Lincoln Road Mall, where some programs are shot indoors and others 
on the mall itself. Though the programming is clearly aimed at the 
young and hip and the average age of the staff seems somewhere south 
of 30, Diller said he never programs ``for demographics,'' adding, 
``I just try to do what is contrarian and interesting.'' There is 
some evidence, though, that members of the young-adult audience attractive 
to advertisers are beginning to watch WAMI. ``The Times,'' for instance, 
got a 1 rating in the current November sweep period, meaning that 
1 percent of the television households in the Miami area were watching. 
Though the number is tiny, a Diller lieutenant voiced cautious optimism. 
``There are signs of life,'' said John Miller, president of USA Broadcasting, 
the programming arm of USA Network. ``The question is: Does this get 
to be a business?'' The competition is daunting. There are 16 television 
stations in Miami, led by the Spanish language Univision-owned station, 
WLTV. WLTV's most recent local news rating was a 7.1. But WAMI's ``The 
Times'' newscast remains Diller's favorite part of his station's lineup. 
One recent newscast carried a feature on worker absenteeism, in which 
the anchor, Amy Atkins, facetiously wondered where some of her station's 
own staff might be. Another ``Times'' segment _ broadcast in August 
after a local politician with a reputation for being a dandy, Humberto 
Hernandez, was indicted in a voter fraud scandal _ included a demonstration 
by a physical trainer of how to stay fit in prison. ``It is a genuinely 
alternative news show,'' Diller said of ``The Times.'' ``We have done 
one murder in five months. By definition, that is an alternative news 
program.'' ``Alternative,'' though, is not necessarily a word that 
goes far with advertisers, particularly when there are dozens of hours 
of local news each week in the Miami market. WAMI expects to take 
in about $4 million in revenues this year and hopes to double that 
number next year, according to a company executive who insisted on 
not being identified. USA Networks has already invested about $12 
million in the station and projects a budget of about $18 million 
annually. To break even, Miller explained, the station needs about 
4 percent of the Miami market's $455 million annual advertising pie. 
But getting there, he said, will require that WAMI attract a 2.5 percent 
to 3 percent share of the viewing audience. ``Right now, for the key 
time period of 4 p.m. to 11 p.m., we have about a one share,'' Miller 
said. ``People say they want innovation, but the room to do it is 
narrower. It is hard to appeal in ways that people are comfortable 
with. You can see the pressures that push people toward the status 
quo.'' Still, a handful of cautious advertisers, including McDonald's, 
are at least testing the WAMI waters. ``It is common for local ad 
buyers to look at new and fun ways to reach customers,'' said Anna 
Rozenich, a McDonald's spokeswoman. ``So our current participation 
is a small part of the overall marketing mix in Miami.'' Making the 
Miami market particularly tricky is the fragmentation caused by its 
mix of English- and Spanish-speaking viewers. Chuck Budt, who heads 
WAMI's advertising effort, said that of the $455 million spent last 
year on advertising in the Miami market, about $75 million went to 
the Spanish-language stations. In Miami, Budt said, ``companies such 
as Budweiser have two ad budgets'' _ one for the English-language 
media and one for the Spanish media. WAMI has tried to introduce programs 
for the younger Spanish market, whose members typically are fluently 
bilingual. One is a talk show, ``Generation N,'' whose title is a 
play on the term Gen-X. The executive producer, Bill Tech, and the 
host, Maria Budet, are both native Miamians of Cuban descent. The 
program ``is for the young, hip, Hispanic market,'' said Matti Lesham, 
the station's editor in chief. ``Much of the programming on the main 
Spanish language stations here is aimed at an older audience.'' But 
segmenting cultural groups will never generate the numbers of viewers 
that coverage of, say, a hot sports team can deliver. Thus was Diller 
determined to establish his station with Miami's sports audience by 
paying $6 million for the broadcast rights to the Miami Heat basketball 
games. ``Sports helps enormously,'' Diller said. ``When you are unknown, 
having something known is of enormous benefit.'' Unfortunately for 
WAMI, the National Basketball Association's lockout has put the Heat 
on the sidelines so far this season. Sports tickets also provide the 
most obvious tie-ins with the company's Ticketmaster telephone and 
online sales business, and, through sports-related paraphernalia, 
with USA's Home Shopping Network business. To keep costs down and 
exposure up, WAMI has assiduously been promoting itself, often forgoing 
more traditional, costly advertising. One recent ploy of the station's 
ebullient marketing chief, Chris Sloan, and a team of WAMI executives 
was a pilgrimage through the streets of South Beach chanting ``WAMI 
Krishna'' and handing out copies of WAMI's programming schedule. And 
with an eye toward the appeal of freebees, an on-air contest promoted 
by the life-styles guru Robin Leach awarded as its prize a free family 
weekend at a palatial local beachfront villa. Given all the vagaries, 
why is Diller, at this stage in his career, devoting so much attention 
to development of a single local TV station? For one thing, he may 
eventually be able to spread the start-up costs over his other stations. 
If a programming concept like ``10'' or ``The Times'' takes off, USA 
could expand the concept _ or the WAMI show itself _ to USA's 12 other 
local stations around the nation. And for that matter, the start-up 
costs are relatively small. Leshem, for example, discovered the co-hosts 
of ``Ken's Freakquency,'' Patrick Doody and Chris Valenziano, flipping 
burgers at Johnny Rockets, a fast-food restaurant, after they graduated 
from the University of Miami Film School. ``When we told them they 
would earn $850 a week, they kind of incredulously said `For both 
of us?''' Lesher recalled. ``We said, `No, for each of you.' They 
nearly fell off their chairs.''
