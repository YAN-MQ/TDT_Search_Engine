After a weekend of digesting each other's proposals, internal negotiating 
teams from the National Basketball Association and the players association 
are scheduled to meet on Monday or Tuesday in Manhattan. Both sides 
were encouraged after Friday's 10-hour bargaining session, in which 
the players and the owners made compromises on key economic issues. 
However, both sides wanted to take some time to review their positions 
before continuing talks. The next discussions are expected to be conducted 
by a smaller number of representatives, including NBA Commissioner 
David Stern and Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik, the union's executive 
director, Billy Hunter, and the union president, Patrick Ewing. While 
Granik said the Thanksgiving holiday would not be an impediment to 
a full bargaining session, both sides were concerned about bringing 
their full negotiation committees to New York before Thursday. The 
nearly five-month-old lockout was in its 145th day on Sunday. With 
six weeks stricken from the schedule, the earliest the season could 
start would be late December.
