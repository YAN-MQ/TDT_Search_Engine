President John F. Kennedy is being remembered today, the 35th anniversary 
of his assassination. A wreath was laid at Arlington national cemetery 
to Mark one of the darkest moments in American history. In Dallas, 
a number of new exhibits were unveiled in the sixth floor museum of 
the former schoolbook depository building. The site where the fatal 
shots were fired November 22, 1963, is a national historical landmark. 
The new exhibits include an oral history of the assassination.
