Not many athletes leave their sport at the top of their game. But 
Jacco Eltingh, the world's top-ranked men's doubles player, did so 
on Sunday. And he did it by teaming with his longtime doubles partner 
and Dutch countryman, Paul Haarhuis, to win their second world doubles 
championship by beating Mark Knowles of the Bahamas and Daniel Nestor 
of Canada, 6-4, 6-2, 7-5. The 28-year-old Eltingh closed out what 
he said was his final professional match with a forehand volley that 
Nestor barely got his racquet on. The outcome of the Phoenix-ATP Tour 
championship, which brings together the world's eight leading doubles 
teams, was hardly a surprise. Eltingh and the 32-year-old Haarhuis 
had won 38 titles, including five Grand Slam championships, over an 
eight-year span. By winning this year at the French Open and Wimbledon, 
they became the first tandem in the Open era to have won all four 
Grand Slam events and, with 39 titles, are tied for fifth place over 
all. Eltingh decided last February that he would retire at the end 
of this year. Once a top-20 singles player, he stopped playing singles 
in 1997 because of tendinitis in his knees. Eltingh's mobility problems 
were hardly evident on Sunday, however, before a crowd of 7,084 at 
the Hartford Civic Center. He volleyed spectacularly, and often acrobatically. 
Eltingh and Haarhuis, who finished the year with a 46-4 record, never 
lost their serves and broke Knowles four times _ once in the opening 
set, twice in the second set and in the 11th game of the final set 
of the 1-hour-43-minute match. The last break put the Dutchmen ahead, 
6-5, and put Eltingh at the service line to try to close out the match. 
After he went ahead by 40-0, Eltingh said, ``I told Paul that I wanted 
to enjoy the moment.'' He added: ``Then when I went to the service 
line I bounced the ball about 10 times, knowing it could be my last 
serve. But then we lost the next 2 points before I hit the winning 
volley.'' Interviewed at courtside, with the gallery listening in, 
Eltingh said: ``I think I'll go out and have five, six or seven beers. 
Who cares? I don't have to stay in shape anymore.'' Haarhuis, whose 
new partner will be Patrick Galbraith of Seattle, said: ``I feel sad. 
It's kind of the end of an era. It's a shame it's got to stop, but 
it's nice that Jacco and I go out as the top team.''
