accusing U.N. weapons inspectors of making impossible demands. We 
cannot produce documents which don't exist. U.S. forces now wait as 
the U.N. decides how to respond. These documents are truly important. 
They are not just bits of paper. They are a record that we need. President

are on station. We must remain vigilant, and thanks to you, we are. 
And at Arlington, remembrances of an American president and a day 
in Dallas 35 years ago. broadcasting 99company, Inc. Good evening, 
everybody.
