More than 160 soldiers who fired shots at student protesters during 
riots and demonstrations in Indonesia's capital last week have been 
punished for disobeying orders, military chiefs said Sunday. A number 
of officers might face courts-martial over the apparent breakdown 
in the chain of command which led to soldiers firing on demonstrators, 
armed forces spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Maarif said. ``The officers 
who made a mistake will face court martial for their crimes,'' he 
said. Up to 17 people died when armed forces opened fire on demonstrators 
and others during bloody street clashes Nov. 13-14. Hundreds were 
injured. Doctors said last week metal bullet fragments were found 
in the bodies of seven victims, despite top-level orders that only 
plastic bullets or blanks were to be fired. Nine of the dead were 
students shot by military personnel. The latest victim died Sunday 
in a Jakarta hospital from wounds, a local television station reported. 
At a joint news conference, Syamsul and armed forces commander Gen. 
Wiranto repeated claims that a small group of anti-government agitators 
provoked the demonstrators to violence in an attempt to disrupt a 
special sitting of the legislative assembly. Wiranto said a military 
investigation into the street clashes so far had failed to trace the 
source of the metal bullet fragments. Syamsul said 163 soldiers had 
been punished for ``undisciplined behavior'' for firing warning shots 
without orders during the melee. The nature of the punishment was 
not specified. He said that according to checks made of weapons used, 
none fired the caliber of bullets that were found in the bodies. ``The 
metal bullets found are not the caliber of the guns usually used by 
security officers,'' Syamsul said. ``We are still investigating where 
the bullets came from.'' So far, 10 anti-government activists, including 
two retired army generals, have been charged with fomenting the protests 
in a bid to overthrow the government. If convicted they could be imprisoned 
for life.
