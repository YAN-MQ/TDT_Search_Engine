President John F. Kennedy is being remembered today, the 35th anniversary 
of his assassination. This morning, a wreath was laid at Arlington 
national cemetery to Mark one of the darkest moments in American history. 
In Dallas, a number of new exhibits were unveiled in the sixth floor 
museum of the former schoolbook depository building. Five years ago, 
the site where the fatal shots were fired November 22, 1963, was made 
a national historical landmark. The new exhibits include an oral history 
of the assassination.
