The Middle East peace deal is moving forward, but not without hitting 
some snags. Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails have begun a hunger 
strike and their leaders are accusing Israel of going back on its 
word. The dispute is over Israel's release of certain prisoners. Walter 
Rodgers reports, the disagreement may be casting a shadow on the accord. 
Palestinian police entered six more villages as the Israeli pullback 
continued. Portraying themselves as liberaters and savoring the spotlight, 
Palestinian police celebrated. Free forever. The occupation is over, 
the town crier said. Israeli and Palestinian soldiers are working 
in expanded patrols and got high marks from the diplomats who negotiated 
this deal. The commanders on the ground had a very smooth transition 
and I think the whole process of turning over the 99.1% of the West 
Bank size then transfer within that area a or B was done in less than 
12 hours and went smoothly. Not so smooth, the release of 250 Palestinian 
prisoners last week. Palestinians cried foul when more than half turned 
out to be common criminals. Palestinians thought they negotiated the 
release of what they call political prisoners, those who struggle 
to end the Israeli occupation. Yasser Arafat thought he was bringing 
home as what he saw heroes of the resistance. Not so said the Israeli 
prime minister. Murderers should stay in jail. That is our policy. 
But this Palestinian negotiator claimed that double standards saying 
Mr. Netanyahu routinely releases Palestinians. He released Palestinians 
who killed a man, and he released all Israelis who killed Palestinian. 
Bids to take over more disputed land are becoming increasingly common 
since the sighing of the wye agreement and signal new flash points. 
What we plan to do, expand now and continue expanding. Diplomatic 
sources warn the wye process remains fragile. Prime minister Netanyahu's 
domestic considerations, like settlers, could get derail the process, 
so could another mistake by Arafat. Even more worrisome is the fear 
extreme is on either side may torpedo the accomplishments of wye.
