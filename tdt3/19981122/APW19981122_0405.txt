Succumbing to international pressure, Bosnian Muslims signed a controversial 
agreement of special ties with neighboring Croatia Sunday. The agreement, 
which is founded in the Dayton accords that ended war in 1995, is 
to regulate and strengthen bilateral relations between Croatia proper 
and the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation, which controls 51 percent 
of Bosnia. It is designed to outline the framework for relations, 
which are dogged by distrust and suspicions. The president of Bosnia's 
rotating tripartite government, Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, arrived 
to close the deal after two prior postponements due to opposition 
at home. ``It is no secret that ... there have been certain reservations 
and suspicions regarding the special relations agreement,'' Izetbegovic 
acknowledged, adding that minor changes in word formulation of the 
document had helped bring about a change of heart. Most Muslims believe 
the deal could spell the doom of the fledgling nation which is struggling 
to keep a lid on Bosnian Croat and Serb aspirations to join their 
brethren in neighboring Croatia to the west, and Serbia to the east. 
They feel that a special ties agreement with Croatia may give it a 
foot in the door and strengthen any attempts on its part to annex 
the southwestern part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Croats are numerous. 
International observers, who brokered the deal, however, believe it 
will act as a framework for future agreements in such matters as trade, 
transport and military, strengthening cooperation and making contacts 
more transparent. ``It is up to you, whether what we do here today 
actually makes the difference, or just generates another historical 
document that brings no change,'' said Jacques Klein, a deputy to 
the international community's top Bosnian envoy, Carlos Westendorp. 
``If properly implemented, the agreements will mean jobs, they will 
mean trade, they will mean integration with Europe, for Croatia, for 
the federation and for Bosnia.'' A sub-agreement within the pact commits 
Croatia to lease the port of Ploce to Bosnia in return for a free 
corridor for Croatia through a narrow stretch of Bosnian territory 
cutting into Croatia's southern tail. Bosnian Croats, aided by their 
patrons in Zagreb, turned against their erstwhile Muslim allies in 
1993 and fought a bloody yearlong war-within-a-war. It is believed 
that Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has yet to fully discard alleged 
ambitions to carve up Bosnia with the Serbs. Relations have been on 
a steady mend since the war. But lingering distrust, often punctuated 
by outbursts of ethnically related violence, has hampered more substantial 
chances of a lasting peace. Hardline Bosnian Croat resistance to return 
of Muslim refugees also continues to poison the atmosphere.
