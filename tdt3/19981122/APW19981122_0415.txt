Tribesmen blew up an oil pipeline in northern Yemen Sunday to protest 
government policy, a tribal spokesman said. The Jahm tribesmen blew 
up the pipeline in Marib province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast 
of the capital, San`a, causing a fire but no casualties, a tribesman 
said. The fire was burning hours after the explosion, he said. It 
was the first attack on an oil pipeline since a truce between the 
government and tribesmen in July following a series of pipeline explosions. 
The Jahm tribe was responsible for several of those blasts. It had 
been demanding more government projects in the area, including roads, 
schools and medical clinics. ``We blew up the pipeline because the 
government has not kept it promises to finance projects in the region,'' 
the tribal spokesman said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
A Yemeni official condemned the blast as ``a lawless act,'' and said 
the government was building schools and roads all over Yemen equally 
according to need. Tribesmen attacked the pipeline carrying oil from 
Ma'rib to the Red Sea port of Hodeida nine times in June and July, 
blowing holes in it and then lighting the fuel on fire with a tracer 
round or a blowtorch. Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited 
by tribes who do not hesitate to use firearms to settle scores with 
rivals or to express discontent with the government.
