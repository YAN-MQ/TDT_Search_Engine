It took a while, but this college football season may finally have 
short-circuited the computers. How? After the three undefeated teams 
at the top of the polls played big games Saturday, all three _ Tennessee, 
UCLA and Kansas State _ remained undefeated. Something was supposed 
to happen to make the new Bowl Championship Series ranking shake out. 
Nothing did. Instead, the calculators will recalculate some static 
numbers and the Bowl Championship Series will remain pretty much the 
same. The Volunteers remain the No. 1 team in The Associated Press 
news media poll; the Wildcats are No. 1 in the USA Today/ESPN poll 
of coaches. And both polls agree that the Bruins are No. 3. The New 
York Times computer ranking continues to put Florida State at No. 
1, followed by Tennessee, Kansas State and UCLA. Monday, when the 
Bowl Championship Series ranking _ which will determine the teams 
for the national title game _ is released, it will probably look the 
same as it did last week: Tennessee (10-0) on top, with UCLA (10-0) 
second and Kansas State (11-0) third. Kansas State should close the 
gap on UCLA, though, as a result of its 31-25 victory over Missouri. 
With the season drawing to a close, and with it the all-important 
data the new ranking system needs, are the Bowl Championship Series 
gurus getting nervous? ``No, not at all,'' said Charles Bloom, the 
bowl series spokesman. ``It has people talking _ good or bad. It's 
put the focus on the game.'' The trouble is that the talk sounds pretty 
much the same as it did before quartiles and decimal points were turned 
over to Big Brother to help decide which teams were the nation's No. 
1 and No. 2. Now the sounds of late November echo the days when the 
news media and the coaches selected their top teams. As last year 
when Michigan and Nebraska shared the national crown. The campaign 
began as soon as each of the three teams beat their opponents Saturday 
and checked the scoreboard and saw that the others had done the same. 
``We could have scored 80,'' was the slogan Tennessee's Cedric Wilson 
chose after six different Volunteers scored en route to a 59-21 thumping 
of Kentucky. Out West, UCLA Coach Bob Toledo took a more earnest tone. 
His Bruins had just won their 20th straight game _ the nation's longest 
current winning streak _ and beaten its crosstown rival, Southern 
Cal, 34-17, for the eighth consecutive year. ``Our team is good enough 
to win 20 games in a row,'' Toledo said. ``Our team's good enough 
to win the Pac-10 championship. Our team's good enough to compete 
with anyone in the country. If we beat Miami, we should go to the 
Fiesta Bowl.'' Kansas State's victory over Missouri means the Wildcats 
have won 19 straight, are in the Big 12 championship game and deserve 
to be mentioned alongside the Volunteers and Bruins, even if Kansas 
State Coach Bill Snyder wasn't overwhelmed by a performance in which 
his team gave up 440 yards and committed 105 yards in penalties. ``What 
I look at is how well you're playing,'' Snyder said. ``Are we getting 
better? Are we playing well? And I wasn't real pleased with a lot 
of things we did. That was what was on my mind coming off the field.'' 
Now the Bowl Championship Series ranking is running out of wiggle 
room. Tennessee has a game against hapless Vanderbilt and then a date 
in the Southeastern Conference championship game _ against either 
Mississippi State or Arkansas. UCLA has one game left _ against Miami 
in a contest that was postponed because of Hurricane Georges. And 
Kansas State faces Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 championship game. 
Before tossing the bowl ranking into the college football lexicon, 
its gurus applied its formula to the last 10 seasons. Only once, in 
1992, did three teams finish unbeaten. By the Bowl Championship Series 
standard, Miami was No. 1, Alabama was No. 2 and Texas A&AMP;M was 
No. 5. It turned out to be a good year for poll voters when Alabama 
beat Miami in the Sugar Bowl and an undisputed champion was crowned. 
So the Bowl Championship Series organizers had a small chance of having 
their inaugural ranking cause more confusion than clarity. Their mantra 
all year has been: ``We're only trying to identify the top two teams.'' 
Now they have three, two of them separated by fractions. So what happens 
if Tennessee, UCLA and Kansas State complete perfect seasons? (The 
very thing that organizers created the ranking to get away from.) 
``The subjective polls weigh heavily and will decide one and two,'' 
Bloom conceded. In other words, same as it ever was. And about as 
cruel as John Cooper and Ohio State finally beating Michigan only 
to clear the way for Wisconsin to go to the Rose Bowl. The media poll 
still has too much influence. The coaches' poll, too. In a very possible 
scenario, Tennessee could face UCLA in the Fiesta Bowl. The coaches 
have declared that game their championship and will award their national 
title to the winner. In the Orange Bowl, Kansas State would play Florida 
State (11-1). Should the Wildcats win, the media poll would choose 
them the national champion. No one really wants these three splendid 
unbeaten teams to lose, but Bowl Championship Series organizers must 
be fighting the impulse to hope that one of them goes down. But how 
is this for an upside? Isn't it fun to think that there isn't a computer 
smart enough to figure out something as simple as college football?
