President Clinton says he sees "signs of danger" from north Korea. 
He made the comment in south Korea as he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment 
to the country. In a speech aimed at the communist north, Mr. Clinton 
said the United States has an "unshakable alliance" with south Korea. 
He urged the north to abandon efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction 
and missile systems to deliver them. Mr. Clinton made a prethanksgiving 
visit to some of the 37,000 U.S. military personnel stationed along 
the world's most heavily guarded border. He told them they must remain 
vigilant in the face of intensified dangers from the north. Mr. Clinton 
cited north Korea's recent missile tests and questions about an underground 
installation U.S. intelligence suspects may be nuclear-related.
