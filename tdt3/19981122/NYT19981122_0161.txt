Frederick D. Wilkinson Jr., one of the first black executives at Macy's, 
the City of New York and, later, at the American Express Co., died 
at Mount Vernon Hospital in Mount Vernon, N.Y., on Nov. 15. He was 
77. The cause of death was lung cancer, according to his family. Born 
in 1921 in Washington, Wilkinson graduated in 1942 from Howard University, 
where his father was the registrar. He served in the Army for four 
years and was discharged as a captain. He graduated with distinction 
from Harvard Business School in 1948 and, upon graduation, joined 
Macy's in the company's executive training program. In a 26-year career 
at Macy's, Wilkinson had a series of jobs, starting as an assistant 
buyer and later overseeing buying in Europe and Asia. He negotiated 
merchandise purchases throughout the world, from Israel to Italy, 
from Germany to Macao. In 1968, he became the manager of the Macy's 
store in the borough of Queens, and later he became the first black 
to serve as a vice president for the retailer. In 1974, Mayor Abraham 
Beame appointed Wilkinson to be executive officer for passenger services 
for the New York City Transit Authority. He later became executive 
officer for surface transit with operating responsibilities for the 
bus system in the five boroughs. In these positions, Wilkinson had 
operating responsibility over 13,400 employees and 4,550 buses. In 
an obituary that Wilkinson had written about himself shortly before 
his death, he said he had ``eschewed the role as spokesman for minority 
causes'' because he could not meet the conflicting ``bottom-line demands'' 
of his job and being a spokesman for his race. He said he chose to 
work ``behind the scenes offering advice and guidance to those who 
needed it, but never interceding with an employer.'' For 24 years, 
Wilkinson was a trustee and national treasurer of the National Urban 
League, and he worked to bring information about jobs in corporate 
America to students at traditionally black colleges. For 20 years, 
he was a Sunday school teacher in the South Bronx. Wilkinson wrote 
that he ``took pride in being a pioneer who simply wouldn't let his 
race stop him from moving up the corporate ladder _ and, in the process, 
opening doors for others whom he showed it could be done.'' Wilkinson 
joined American Express in 1977 as a marketing vice president in the 
travel-related services division. By the time he retired in 1993, 
he had been promoted to senior vice president for worldwide communications. 
He was also active in a variety of volunteer programs, including serving 
as acting chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority Inspector 
General's Advisory Board, as a life overseer at Cornell Medical College 
and as a member of the board of overseers at the Brookdale Center 
of Aging at Hunter College in Manhattan. Wilkinson is survived by 
his wife of 53 years, Jeane, of Mount Vernon; two daughters, Sharon, 
the U.S. ambassador to Burkina Faso, and Dayna, of Reston, Va.; and 
one son, Frederick D. III, of Los Angeles.
