Gerard Grisey, a leading modern French composer, has died, his wife 
said Sunday. He was 52. Grisey died of a stroke Wednesday in Paris, 
said Mireille Guigui, his wife. Grisey was born in 1946 in Belfort, 
in eastern France, and studied music at the conservatory in Trossingen, 
Germany. He later studied at the Paris Conservatoire and the Ecole 
Normale de la Musique. He also studied acoustics at the Faculty of 
Sciences in Paris. In 1972 he was awarded the Rome Prize and spent 
the following two years in the Italian capital. In 1980, he became 
one of the first composers to work at the Institute of Research and 
Coordination for Acoustics and Music (IRCAM). The Paris center, dedicated 
to promoting modern music in France, was the brainchild of the composer 
Pierre Boulez and the late French President Georges Pompidou. Grisey 
composed works for both ensemble and electronics. His best known compositions 
include the 1977 work ``Modulations'' and ``Jour Contre Jour,'' completed 
in 1979. Most recently, he completed ``Stele'' in 1995. Grisey had 
taught at the Paris Conservatoire since 1986. There was no immediate 
information about further survivors or funeral plans.
