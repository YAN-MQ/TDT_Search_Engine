A teenage prank has many police officers around the country worried. 
More and more often, teens and young people are aiming red laser pointers 
at lawmen. While the small beams of light are harmless, officers can 
mistake them as a Beam coming from a laser gun sight mounted on guns. 
In fact, one Connecticut town banned sales of pointers to anyone under 
18 after three police officers drew their guns on teens in a shopping 
mall after they'd been targeted with a laser pointer.
