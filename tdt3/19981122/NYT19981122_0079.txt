Attempts to transmit Internet data over cable-television wires have 
generally focused on only the largest cable-system operators. But 
high-speed data options for smaller cable companies and their customers 
are set to expand over the next few weeks as Internet companies move 
into rural areas. Softnet Systems, a small company based in Mountain 
View, Calif., intends to announce an agreement Monday to acquire Intelligent 
Communications, a private concern based in Fremont, Calif., for about 
$10.5 million in stock, according to executives close to the companies. 
Softnet hopes that the deal will enable it to offer small cable operators 
a direct satellite link to the Internet. And next week at the Western 
Cable Show in Anaheim, Calif., At Home Corp., an Internet venture 
that is backed by many of the United States' largest cable carriers, 
intends to announce a ready-made data solution for small and medium-sized 
cable operators, according to executives close to At Home. Only a 
minuscule fraction of U.S. consumers are now able to tap the Internet 
at speeds faster than the 50 or so kilobits a second allowed by analog 
modems. The cable television and local telephone industries are vying 
to be the first to offer widespread Internet access at office-caliber 
speeds, which are much higher. Last week, Softnet reached deals to 
sell its operations that distribute office telephone equipment and 
that create microfiche documents for about $12 million in cash and 
short-term notes. The company now hopes to focus on its ISP Channel 
unit, which helps small cable operators get their customers online. 
Lawrence Brilliant, the chief executive of Softnet, is looking to 
Intelligent Communications to carry out that strategy. Founded in 
the early 1990s by former Xerox Corp. executives, Intelligent Communications 
had about $3 million in revenue last year and owns technology that 
allows two-way Internet communications using satellites and relatively 
small dish antennas _ about 5 feet in diameter _ according to executives 
close to the planned acquisition deal. Softnet's business plan is 
based on the assumption that satellites provide a more economical 
way than do expensive high-speed fiber-optic cables to link cable 
systems in remote areas to the Internet. By contrast, At Home intends 
to stick with terrestrial links for its new system, according to executives 
close to the plan. The big difference between At Home's previous deals 
with cable companies and the new plan is that under the new system, 
At Home would bear more of the initial cost of creating those links 
(and cable affiliates would bear less), and At Home would keep a bigger 
percentage of the future profit.
