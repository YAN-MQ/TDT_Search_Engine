Give Francesco Totti credit for being frank, if not for sportsmanship. 
The AS Roma captain admitted Sunday that he fell to the ground on 
purpose to draw a penalty whistle from the referee in his club's 1-1 
Serie A home draw with Bari the day before. Referee Livio Bazzoli 
called the foul when Totti, who made his debut start for Italy's national 
team last week, went down just inside the penalty area after light 
contact with Bari's Moroccan defender Rachid Neqrouz with nine minutes 
left. Roma was trailing 1-0 at the time. ``I was ahead of Neqrouz 
and as soon as I felt contact I threw myself to the ground,'' Totti 
said. ``The referee could have given the penalty or let the action 
continue. Maybe the fact that we were losing had an influence.'' The 
striker slotted in the spot kick for his fifth goal of the season, 
while several Bari players argued the call. Roma has a 5-3-2 record 
for 18 points, three behind Italian League leader Fiorentina.
