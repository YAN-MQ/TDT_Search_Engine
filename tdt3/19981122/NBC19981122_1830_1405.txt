When NBC "Nightly News" continues in a moment -- remembering the national 
tragedy on November 22nd, 1963. A bunch of us here in Lafayette, Colorado, 
ate quaker oatmeal for 30 days. It helped reduce my cholesterol 16 
points. My bowling average is still a little lower than my cholesterol. 
But I'm working on it. When your allergies are a nightmare, you need 
help. Not just any help. You need the power of zyrtec. Prescription 
zyrtec starts working fast... and keeps on working for 24 hours. And 
zyrtec works against so many allergies, from cats and dogs... to pollen 
and dust. So when allergies are a nightmare-- and when are they not? 
Remember... in studies, drowsiness was the most common side effect. 
Others included tigue and dry mouth. Most side effects were mild or 
moderate. Most people weren't bothered by them enough... to stop taking 
zyrtec. To learn more, look for... our ad in life magazine... orsk 
your doctor or pharmacist.
