Life came to the Sahara desert recently, along with color and beauty. 
The occasion was a rather unusual fashion show. Princess wilkes reports. 
The Sahara desert, so hot, dry and bland in color that you can hardly 
distinguish the camels in the wind-whipped sand. But all that changed 
as the organizers of the international festival of african fashion 
put on a show at the foot of sand dunes in the tenere desert in Niger. 
Ablaze with color and beauty, more than 60 models from around the 
world volunteered to come and show off the latest African collections. 
The models strutted the fashions of top designers from Africa and 
Europe in a show watched by fashion envoys, Niger's president and 
a nationwide television audience. Some wore jewelry designed by mickael 
kra. He says the masai tribes of east Africa inspired his latest collection. 
My theme this year was water and stone. So here you have clay, which 
makes one think of the Sahara, and glass because glass is made from 
stone. I'm inspired by the masai tribe, I've made lots of high neck 
jewelry and very symmetrical things. The risque outfits conflicted 
sharply with some religious beliefs, and many religious leaders in 
Niger were opposed to the show. For the models who usually stay in 
plush hotel rooms instead of tents in the middle of the desert, cool 
nights, insects and a shortage of food and water proved to be quite 
a challenge. Sudanese-born model alek wek was among the models who 
took a chance at roughing it in the desert to be part of the show. 
It's positive you know what I mean. You can actually go home and feel 
good that you've done your part. While promoting African fashion and 
culture, some of the proceeds also went towards raising the awareness 
of the threat of AIDS in Africa. Organizers admit there are a few 
problems to be worked out, but they say they will bring the show back 
to the African desert in two years, and that it will be better than 
ever. Princess wilkes, CNN.
