President Clinton heads to Guam this evening as he wraps up a five-day 
visit in Asia. Today, he met with U.S. troops stationed about eight 
miles from the Korean peninsula's heavily guarded demilitarized zone. 
The president told them the United States and south Korea are committed 
to freedom in the region. And John king reports Mr. Clinton issued 
a warning about north Korea. The U.S. commander in chief came to say 
thanks, and to deliver a Message at a time of tension with Iraq and 
north Korea. Our ability to succeed in promoting peace is uniquely 
due to the fact that we can back up our diplomatic efforts when necessary 
with military strength. And that depends on you, the finest armed 
forces in the world. This was supposed to be a routine drop-by, a 
chance for the president to mix and mingle with some of the 37,000 
U.S. forces in south korea. I like that. I'll put that up on my desk 
Monday. Want me to express it? Pick up a few gifts. Sample the military 
menu. And lead the troops in a chorus. Happy birthday to you But Mr. 
Clinton wasn't all smiles as he visited U.S. forces stationed near 
the demilitarized zone separating south Korea from the communist north. 
U.S. forces remain on standby in the Persian gulf, where Iraqi president 
saddam Hussein is in a new dispute with United Nations weapons inspectors. 
And not everyone is so laid-back here in south Korea these days. Lately, 
signs of danger have intensified, with incursions from the north, 
provocative missile tests and the question of a suspect underground 
installation. So we must remain vigilant. The president is taking 
a wait-and-see approach to both Iraq and north Korea, and taking time 
to thank the men and women who have the most at risk if the diplomats 
fail. It sort of lets us know that we're not completely forgotten 
over here. The president heads home from Asia on Monday, stopping 
in Guam along the way, and plans a relatively quiet Thanksgiving week. 
But it's nearing decision time in the impeachment debate, so calm 
may prove hard to come by. John king, CNN, Seoul.
