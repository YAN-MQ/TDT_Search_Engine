Journalist Pete Hamill, who had known Frank Sinatra casually over 
the years, was left feeling dissatisfied by the coverage of Sinatra's 
death on May 14. While the reporting was both prominent and extensive, 
Hamill writes in his evocative tribute, ``Why Sinatra Matters,'' ``much 
of the language of farewell had a stale, even hollow quality, probably 
because most of the obituaries had been ready for too many months.'' 
On television, the words ``about loss and farewell'' had ``an odd 
insincerity,'' Hamill continues; ``they could have been discussing 
someone from the 19th century.'' He adds, ``It was difficult, reading 
and watching all of this, to remember why Sinatra mattered to so many 
people, and why he will continue to matter in the years ahead.'' There 
was the music, yes, but there was so much more, he says. ``Through 
a combination of artistic originality, great passion and immense will, 
he transcended several eras and indirectly helped change the way all 
of us lived.'' In what follows, Hamill traces the essential threads 
of Sinatra's turbulent life, gracefully knitting them into his own 
memories of growing up in an era when the singer's yearning voice 
was always in the background, especially in the middle of the night 
``when he tells the bartender that it's a quarter to 3 and there's 
no one in the place except you and me.'' Hamill sees two themes in 
particular standing out in Sinatra's life. One was his experiences 
as the only child of Italian immigrants in Hoboken, N.J., which because 
of the times he lived in made him a lonely, angry outcast by nature, 
often at odds with the establishment. One of the prices he paid for 
this was to become associated in the public's mind with Italian gangsters. 
(Hamill argues that while Sinatra by his own admission knew many mobsters 
through his work as a nightclub and casino entertainer, they were 
never responsible for advancing his career.) His triumph was to become 
one of three heroes _ Fiorello La Guardia and Joe DiMaggio being the 
others _ who helped integrate the children of Italian immigrants into 
American life. The other major theme developed by Hamill is the three-act 
drama of Sinatra's career that comprises its initial rise, its terrible 
fall in the late 1940s and its great comeback in the early 1950s after 
he won the part of Angelo Maggio in the film of James Jones' ``From 
Here to Eternity.'' The fall had to do with his relations with the 
press, his trouble with women and his liberal politics. They cost 
him his audience of adoring female fans. The pain of the experience 
increased his loneliness, yet eventually contributed to his comeback. 
The comeback constituted his redemption, which won him his true audience, 
the men who had once resented his early good luck and hubris. Everything 
went into his music, Hamill argues. For all the fame of his exploits, 
Sinatra is essentially his music. As he refined his extraordinary 
technique, he ``slowly found a way to allow tenderness into the performance 
while remaining manly.'' When he ``finally took command of his own 
career, he perfected the role of the Tender Tough Guy and passed it 
on to several generations of Americans.'' Hamill concludes, ``That 
is one reason why he continues to matter; Frank Sinatra created a 
new model for American masculinity.'' ``I liked him enormously,'' 
Hamill admits. If he fails to make you feel the same amount of affection 
for Sinatra, he certainly conveys his hero's rough charm. But does 
he persuade you that Sinatra's music is ``high art'' worthy of being 
mentioned in the same paragraph as Mozart's? Not quite. High art implies 
a completeness and a scale of humanity that Sinatra's work does not 
achieve. The redemption Hamill claims for his subject never brought 
Sinatra to a reconciliation with women, at least not in the story 
that this book tells. Hamill hints darkly of Sinatra's inability ever 
to free himself from his mother. (``When I would get out of hand,'' 
Hamill quotes Sinatra telling him, ``she would give me a rap with 
that little club; then she'd hug me to her breast. I married the same 
woman every time.'') After his painful breakup with Ava Gardner in 
1953, Hamill writes, ``he transformed himself into the Sinatra who 
wore a hat. The swinger whose best friends were men. The man with 
a lot of women, which was, of course, like having no woman at all.'' 
He says: ``The message was there in the music, the attitude, even 
the hat: He had come through a hard, dark time, and he wasn't ever 
going back into the darkness.'' The darkness being women, presumably. 
This is not a message worthy of high art. In Hamill's handling at 
least, those wee small hours of the morning are a landscape of adolescence. 
Still, his book does admirably convey why Sinatra's music has been 
so much a part of the lives of so many generations. In one chapter's 
epigraph, Hamill quotes a lovely paragraph from ``La Merica: Images 
of Italian Greenhorn Experience,'' by Luciano De Crescenzo, describing 
how departing immigrants used to bring on board balls of yarn, leaving 
one end of the line with someone on land. ``As the ship slowly cleared 
the dock, the balls unwound,'' and ``after the yarn ran out, the long 
strips remained airborne, sustained by the wind, long after those 
on land and those at sea had lost sight of each other.'' When the 
book ends, ``it's like a thousand people have just left the room,'' 
as Hamill says of Sinatra's death. But like the strips of yarn, his 
music keeps floating, sustained by memory. Which is enough to tell 
us why Sinatra matters. PUBLICATION NOTES: `WHY SINATRA MATTERS' By
