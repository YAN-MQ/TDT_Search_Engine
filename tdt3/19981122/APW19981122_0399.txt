A radical Hindu group that controls the governing party urged Muslims 
and Christians on Sunday to accept Hindu culture, saying it would 
not go against their religious beliefs. The call by the leader of 
the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh or RSS came amid a week of controversy 
over Hindu nationalists asking school students to sing Hindu songs 
in praise of Mother India, a move that was subsequently dropped following 
protests. The RSS is the core group that controls numerous Hindu organizations, 
including the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is in power in India. 
The group promotes a brand of Hindu nationalism that many secular 
Indians regard as distasteful. It has been blamed for promoting religious 
intolerance, particularly against Muslims, who make up 12 percent 
of India's nearly 1 billion population. The Bharatiya Janata and other 
groups associated with the RSS were blamed for the destruction of 
an ancient mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya that Hindus also 
claim. The destruction touched off nationwide Hindu-Muslim riots that 
left 2,000 people dead. In recent weeks, The RSS and its followers 
in the populous state of Uttar Pradesh have insisted that school students 
sing ``Vande Mataram,'' a popular song hailing Mother India. It was 
widely sung during India's independence movement against British colonialists 
but found disfavor later on because of its association with Hindu 
philosophy. ``Those who refuse to recite Vande Mataram are not children 
of Mother India,'' said K.C. Sudharshan, RSS joint-secretary, during 
a meeting in this northern town, some 100 kilometers (66 miles) northwest 
of New Delhi. ``Hindus cannot consider those who are not children 
of Mother India as their brothers and sisters,'' Sudarshan said. ``Muslims 
in Indonesia draw inspiration from Hindu mythology and texts. What 
problem do the Muslims here have? Christians and Muslims in India 
are not foreigners. They were originally Hindus, but they embraced 
the religions of foreigners and set themselves apart from their fellow 
Hindu countrymen.''
