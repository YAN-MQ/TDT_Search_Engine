Aggressively wooing foreign computer software companies, a city in 
southern India unveiled a technology park Sunday where companies such 
as Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and Sun Microsystems have set up shop. 
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called it the ``biggest and most 
exciting development in the information technology sector in India.'' 
The 10-story building, part of the Hitech City project on the outskirts 
of Hyderabad, capital of Andhra Pradesh state, was built a little 
over one year after Microsoft chief Bill Gates extracted a promise 
from state Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu that he would improve 
the infrastructure there. Microsoft and Oracle have taken up one floor 
each in the building. The rest of the space has already been taken 
up by other software companies, according to S.D. Kulkarni, chairman 
of Larsen and Toubro, which constructed the building. The park, spread 
over 160 acres (65 hectares) is estimated to cost the government 15,000 
million rupees (dlrs 352 million). When completed over the next five 
years, it is expected to employ 10,000 people. In a message to Naidu, 
Microsoft chief Gates said such investments will improve the local 
infrastructure and attract foreign investors. Software export from 
Andhra Pradesh touched 5,000 million rupees (dlrs 117 million) this 
year, a tenfold increase since Naidu became chief minister about five 
years ago. In recent months, Naidu has toured foreign countries to 
invite investors to Andhra Pradesh state. He spends hours every day, 
surfing the internet to scout for investors or to chat with venture 
capitalists. In a country where computers are few and resistance to 
them from trade unions is fierce, Naidu has increased computerization 
of government records in Andhra Pradesh state to make information 
easily available to the public. ``Information Technology can be effective 
tool to restore credibility in the government,'' Naidu said.
