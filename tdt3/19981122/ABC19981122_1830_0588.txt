Impeachment remained the hot topic of conversation on the Washington 
talk show circuit today. The future speaker of the house says the 
impeachment process must go forward. Louisiana republican Robert Livingston 
says the house has a duty to vote on impeachment, even if the public 
opinion is against it. Which way that vote should go remains the subject 
of heated debate. Impeachment is far beyond what should be done. The 
American people's wisdom, I think, mirrors the wisdom of the founding 
fathers, that lying about an extramarital relationship is not the 
type of a Punishment they envisioned when it came to impeachment. 
If this had been a republican president who had done this, you think 
he'd be sitting there today? I don't. I think he'd be gone. I don't 
believe that the conduct itself rises to the level of high crimes 
and misdemeanors. At the same time, I think we have a responsibility 
to make sure that the president is punished for his conduct. If perjury 
and bribery of a witness are not high crimes and misdemeanors, if 
lying in a way that would destroy the integrity of the judicial system 
of this country by the highest executive officer, law enforcement 
officer, of the country is not impeachable, then I'll eat my hat. 
It is indeed impeachable.
