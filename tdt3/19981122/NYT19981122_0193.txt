The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23: When Marie 
Curie died on July 4, 1934, Albert Einstein remarked that she was, 
``of all celebrated beings, the only one whom fame has not corrupted.'' 
It has been a century since Curie and her husband, Pierre, who died 
in 1906, discovered polonium and radium, just a century since she 
coined the word ``radioactivity.'' Their discoveries brought the Curies 
worldwide fame, and yet fame, ironically, made the name Curie a byword 
for modesty. The laboratory in which their most important work was 
done was only a former storeroom and machine shop, and they always 
refused, Marie Curie wrote, ``to draw from our discovery any material 
profit.'' A small exhibition devoted to Marie Curie has been mounted 
at the New York Academy of Sciences. It suggests that the history 
of radioactivity during the past century divides into two parts, before 
1934, when natural radioactivity was the focus of scientific study, 
and after 1934, when the first man-made radioactive elements were 
created. Most lay people are likely to feel that the century divides 
a little more neatly than that: before 1945 _ when the first atomic 
bombs were detonated _ and after 1945. Marie Curie died as a result 
of exposure to radioactivity, some of it incurred while preparing 
radium for medical use. A century has passed since she discovered 
that radioactivity was a property of atoms, and we are still adding 
up the balance sheet, still trying to weigh the lives saved or improved 
by the scientific exploration of radioactivity against the lives lost 
or inalterably worsened.
