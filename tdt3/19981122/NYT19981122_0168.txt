The No. 1 ranking was out of range for the moment. So Martina Hingis, 
second-ranked by the computer but forever a first-rate contender in 
her mind, took aim at the next best target: the season's last title 
and its $500,000 paycheck. With a cartoon-sized smile on her face 
and homicide in her heart, Hingis upset the rival she now considers 
her archrival, No. 1-ranked Lindsay Davenport, by 7-5, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 
on Sunday to capture the final event of the year, the invitation-only 
Chase Championships at Madison Square Garden. ``I guess I got you 
this time,'' Hingis whispered to Davenport when they met for their 
netside handshake. The two combatants' toe-to-toe history stood at 
7-6 for Hingis after a weary Davenport netted a backhand on her opponent's 
second match point. Besides sending a signal about her intentions 
for 1999, Hingis' performance was payback for her loss to Davenport 
in the U.S. Open final. That 6-3, 7-5 defeat spoiled Hingis' title 
defense and ignited Davenport's successful campaign to embellish her 
first Grand Slam championship with the acquisition of the No. 1 ranking. 
``She kicked me out of No. 1,'' noted Hingis, whose 80-week tenure 
at the top ended on Oct. 12, a development that sent her to Nick Bollettieri's 
Florida academy for a crash course in fitness and fine-tuning. Though 
retrieving the ranking at this event became a mathematical impossibility, 
Hingis convinced herself that exiting 1998 on a winning note was well 
worth her perseverance here, particularly if her victory came at Davenport's 
expense. Sunday's 2-hour-33-minute contest was the final that Hingis, 
without a title since winning the Italian Open in May, had aspired 
to: a finale between the world's top two players. That had occurred 
in this event five times before, all of them victories for the top-ranked 
player. Hingis put an end to that trend. ``It's about time,'' she 
said. ``I'm happy my game has raised again; she deserves No. 1 right 
now, but I'm going to keep up.'' Helpful to the plans of Hingis, the 
18-year-old Swiss star, was the fact that Davenport had played six 
sets of tennis on Saturday. No sooner had Davenport, a 22-year-old 
Californian, fended off five-time champion Steffi Graf in the semifinals 
while sprouting blisters on her feet than she was back on court to 
capture the doubles title with her partner, Natasha Zvereva. ``I was 
just a little bit tired, and that made a difference,'' Davenport said. 
``Everything felt a little sluggish. Martina was much more aggressive 
than she's been the last couple times I've played her. I missed a 
lot of easy shots today, just a little bit awkward and a little bit 
slow to react.'' Hingis had played just seven sets heading into the 
final. Besides having more desperate designs on the title than Davenport, 
Hingis had a tangible edge as well: good health. ``Whoever is in better 
shape at the end of the year can make it to the end,'' said Hingis, 
who found that out the hard way in 1996 when she failed to survive 
a five-set final here with Graf. Sunday Hingis knew that the longer 
the match went, the more fatigued Davenport would be. ``I was playing 
for my pride, that I wanted to win this tournament,'' Hingis said. 
``It feels good to finish up with not losing to anybody.'' Hingis 
will begin 1999 by attempting to win a third straight Australian Open 
title _ and continuing her siege on Davenport's ranking. ``There is 
no doubt that she's going to be back to No. 1, or definitely a threat, 
in the next year,'' Davenport said. Speaking of herself, Davenport 
called it unbelievable that she would leave 1998 with six titles, 
69 match victories, a Grand Slam championship and the No. 1 ranking. 
Davenport dismissed the notion that Sunday's loss carried larger ramifications 
than those on the Garden scoreboard. ``We've played a number of times 
this year, and when I was ranked 2 and I beat her, I didn't think, 
`Oh, I'm the No. 1 player because I beat her.' I knew she really wanted 
to win this tournament; so did I. But I didn't feel like I had to 
win it to end the year at No. 1.'' What Davenport would have had to 
do to win the match, after dropping the first two sets, was somehow 
conjure up the stamina to sweep the next three; but even though she 
rallied in the third, she did not have the energy to accomplish a 
comeback on such a grand scale. Too many drop shots, and too many 
rallies that demanded the tireless repetition of a metronome, took 
their toll. In the final set, Hingis broke for 5-1 when Davenport, 
whose concentration was running on automatic pilot, buried a swinging 
forehand volley in the net mainly because she committed the cardinal 
sin of failing to keep her eye on the ball. Though Davenport snapped 
to attention long enough to spoil Hingis' attempt to serve for the 
match, she was then broken for the match. ``The second set was really 
the telling factor,'' Davenport said. ``I think almost every service 
game she served, I had at least one break point, and I just wasn't 
able to capitalize.'' She was 0 for 5 on break-point conversions in 
that set. ``Maybe if I'd gotten one of those breaks, the match would 
have been a different story,'' Davenport said. ``She wouldn't have 
been as confident as she was up two sets to love. But that's the way 
it goes. I didn't play aggressive enough, and that's the way matches 
turn around.'' And that's why this one didn't.
