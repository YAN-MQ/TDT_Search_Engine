In any crisis, it is the weakest and the most vulnerable who suffer 
the most. Asia's economic crisis is proving no exception, as ABC's 
Mark Litke reports. Frightened and bewildered, 2-year-old Jung ha 
young arrives aa oul orphanage only hours after being abandoned by 
her family. The only consolation -- she is not alone here. They are 
south Korea's economic orphans, and their numbers are growing at an 
alarming rate, hundreds in recent months, given up by out-of-work 
parents. Korea has no social safety net, no welfare system. Suddenly 
without income, destitute families find they're unable to care for 
their children and feel they have no other choice but to hand them 
over to places like the anyang baby home. The director here says it 
is painful to watch. Many are brought in by a parent or relative who 
says they'll be back when they find work, but only a few have returned. 
"There are now so many children," she says, "we are overwhelmed." 
Government funding for orphanages is minimal. Most survive on donations 
and the work of volunteers. This is getting worse every day. Park 
young sook, of south Korea's Foster care association, says the problem 
is made worse by traditional Korean attitudes toward orphans. Family 
bloodlines are very important in this culture, making adoption very 
rare. But park says wealthier Koreans should be providing more help. 
People who are enjoying their lives can pay more attention because 
these are, after all, your own children. Some have been lucky enough 
to find temporary Foster homes. The Kim family took in 5-year-old 
hyung jun, who is thrilled to have a Foster dad he can now hug and 
whisper, "I love you." Most, however, will not be this lucky. The 
outlook for the south Korean economy is still bleak. The lines outside 
public soup kitchens are growing longer. And that means more orphans, 
being well-fed, clothed and cared for for now. But their future is 
very uncertain. The economic crisis has broken the spirit of many 
Koreans. Now, it is breaking their hearts. Mark Litke, ABC News, Seoul.
