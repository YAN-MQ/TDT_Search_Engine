Michael Todd, publisher of Grapezine, a magazine about winegrowing, 
died on Saturday at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. 
He was 51 and had homes in midtown Manhattan and Sag Harbor on Long 
Island. The cause was complications from lymphoma, said his wife, 
Claudia Payne. Todd founded Grapezine five years ago. It focused at 
first on Long Island winegrowing and went on to report about other 
winegrowing regions. Earlier, he was an art director for Psychology 
Today, Wine Spectator and other magazines. He also was a freelance 
art director for The New York Times and operated an advertising-design 
company for a time. He was born in Sevenoaks in the county of Kent 
in Britain, was educated in Britain, worked for an advertising agency 
in London and moved to the United States in 1969. His marriage to 
Mary Peacock ended in divorce. Besides Ms. Payne, a senior editor 
at The New York Times, he is survived by his father, Clifford, of 
Tunbridge Wells in Kent.
