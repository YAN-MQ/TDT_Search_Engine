There may be real progress when talks resume this week between players 
and owners in the NBA. Both sides say Friday's bargaining session 
was the most productive yet. During this lockout, players and fans 
may be asking themselves if there could be life without the NBA. ABC's 
John Frankel reports on one former player who knows that there is. 
Basketball fans are used to seeing Clyde Drexler do this, but in his 
hometown of Houston, they are just as happy to see him do this. Drexler, 
a future hall of famer, walked away from his multimillion-dollar nBA 
salary to coach at the University of Houston, where he first became 
a Star. This was a chance to give back. And there's not a better place 
to give back than at your alma mater. In the early 1980s, Drexler, 
along with Hakeem Olajuwon, was part of the University of Houston's 
famed "phi-slamma-jamma" team. But during his 15-year NBA career, 
which included a championship with the houston Rockets, his once-great 
college team, the Houston Cougars, turned into a fraternity of nobodies. 
Clyde and I, over the last five years, have gone from mildly disturbed 
to profoundly embarrassed. Gettys is one of several former Cougars 
Drexler brought back as part of his coaching staff. You brought everything 
back from those days but your hair. I wish I could bring that back. 
Maybe on the sides. This is more than a trip down memory Lane. Just 
take a look around. Last season, average attendance was 2,800 people. 
This year, every home game is sold out. Drexler's presence has resulted 
in an economic and emotional windfall for the school and instant credibility 
in recruiting players. But the question remains whether a great player 
makes a great coach. For the first two weeks, the kids were scared 
to death of him. I mean, they were just petrified. He would say something, 
they were like, "okay." So far, Drexler has made the transition from 
schooling players in the NBA to teaching these kids. He shows everybody 
new moves every single day. And when you use them in practice, at 
first you don't think they are going to work, but they work 'cause 
he knows what he's talking about. And now, coach Drexler hopes a little 
show-and-tell will raise his team back to the heights he took it to 
in years past. John Frankel, ABC News, Houston.
