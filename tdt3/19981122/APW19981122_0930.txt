Russia and South Africa are expected to sign agreements fostering 
closer trade relations during a visit by Vice President Thabo Mbeki 
that began Sunday. Mbeki, who is expected to succeed President Nelson 
Mandela when elections are held next year, was scheduled to hold negotiations 
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and meet with various political 
and religious leaders, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. He also is 
scheduled to deliver a speech at Peoples' Friendship University. The 
school was a magnet for African students during the Soviet era, when 
it served the government's policy of promoting communism in Africa. 
Since the Soviet collapse, it has fallen on hard times.
