A dispute over documents is proving to be the latest flash point between 
iraq and U.N. weapons inspectors. This incident comes a week after 
a standoff between Iraq and the U.N. almost led to a military strike 
by the United States and Britain. The requested documents reportedly 
detail the history of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs. 
U.S. officials say a military strike is possible if Iraq fails to 
cooperate. Iraq says the request for documents is designed to give 
the United States an excuse to take military action. I hear the media 
is reporting there is a problem about a certain document. That is 
not the case. The case is that Butler has asked for a series of alleged 
documents. He has asked for alleged documents that do not exist. He 
has asked for all the stories which were settled in the past. And 
he also asked for access to all the archives of the government of 
Iraq. Despite the latest tensions, U.N. inspectors in Iraq have been 
visiting suspected sites without interference. On Saturday, they made 
their first surprise visit to a site since returning to Iraq last 
week.
