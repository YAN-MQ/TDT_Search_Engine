You've got the Turkey, stuffing and all the trimmings. But there's 
one more item for your Thanksgiving dinner that's not so easy to decide 
on. Katharine Barrett recommends how to chose a holiday wine. Since 
ancient times, diverse people have been drawn to wine for the same 
reason. It's sensual, and it's complementary to a lot of foods. That's 
part of the attraction, and the challenge, of choosing a Wine for 
a holiday meal, with its competing sweet and sour tastes. Then there's 
the issue of price. For me, $10 a bottle is about right. $15 and up, 
I think, would be a little bit costly, especially because when we 
drink wine, we just don't have one bottle of wine. For your holiday 
meal, say aficionados, red or white is fine. Among the recommendations 
from "wine spectator" magazine, in the under $10 category, hogue Chardonnay 
from Washington state, known to be crisp and juicy. Bodega nekeas 
merlot from Spain has more of an oaky taste. And dry, fruity cline 
red zinfandel from California. You don't have to worry about vintages 
with California winemakers, but elsewhere, it matters. My advice is 
to drink the youngest whites available. I would look at '97 or '96 
now. For reds, something three or four years old is likely to have 
the right combination of fruit and softness. "wine spectator's" picks 
in the $10 to $20 range include -- roederer estate, a red sparkling 
wine to start the party. And Meridian Chardonnay. Among their high-end 
choices -- dolce late harvest, great with pumpkin Pie, for about $50 
a bottle. And the $40 plus kistler Chardonnay. If you're at a loss, 
quality merchants will help you choose a wine to suit both your tastes 
and menu. Even if we don't help them choose, the best thing to do, 
you have to drink. There's no substitute for tasting it. And if you 
like one a lot, buying a case will usually get you a 5% to 10% discount. 
That's "your money." Katharine Barrett, "CNN Financial News," New 
York.
