In his personal essays for The New Yorker magazine, the author known 
only by the pseudonym ``Marcus Laffey'' has written eloquently about 
the sorrows of potters' field and the daily grind of a New York City 
police officer's beat; he has revealed his occasional satisfaction 
in snapping on handcuffs; explained the slang of police officers; 
and told wrenching stories about practically murderous neglect. But 
most of all, he has revealed _ in finely hewn prose that can be lyrical 
and outrageously funny _ what it is really like to be a New York City 
police officer. And last week, the author, still operating from behind 
his pen name, signed a book deal for a reported $995,000 to write 
a personal memoir of his life as a police officer. The working title 
is ``Blue Blood'' and Riverhead Books, a division of Penguin Putnam 
Group, has tentatively scheduled the book for publication in 2001. 
The sale of the book has drawn attention to the fact that the author 
does, in fact, write from behind the protection of a false name, which 
raises a flurry of questions: Why does he write under a pseudonym? 
When is it appropriate? And why does The New Yorker choose to let 
him? Marcus Laffey is actually Edward W. Conlon, a New York City police 
officer and a graduate of Harvard College, class of 1987. Conlon's 
great-grandfather was a police sergeant in Brooklyn, and his father 
was at one time an FBI agent. Conlon first came to the attention of 
the editors at The New Yorker five years ago when he sent in a proposal 
for an article. As both a graduate of an Ivy League college and a 
police officer, Conlon straddles more social worlds in New York than 
most writers. In a November 1997 article for The New Yorker titled 
``Cop Diary,'' he wrote about why he became a police officer: ``My 
father died before I went on the job, but I think my decision to become 
a cop would strike him as an affront to how far we've come from the 
hardscrabble west of Ireland and the docks of Hell's Kitchen.'' David 
Kuhn, a New Yorker editor when Conlon's proposal came in and now executive 
editor of Tina Brown's Talk magazine, chose to work with Conlon and 
spoke to him about using a pseudonym. Although Kuhn thought Conlon 
might change his mind as the publication date approached, he chose 
_ and stuck with _ the pseudonym. ``He did that because it could very 
well change the nature of the way people dealt with him at work,'' 
Kuhn said. ``That was his concern at the time.'' However, his identity 
as a New Yorker writer has never been a closely guarded secret. His 
real name has been known to The New Yorker staff _ and its extended 
social circle _ since his first piece in 1993. In police headquarters, 
Conlon's situation has been known from the outset. The department 
has no problems with his second career as a writer, said Inspector 
Michael Collins, a police spokesman. He is not violating any conflict-of-interest 
laws, Collins said. But Conlon's editor at The New Yorker, Alice Truax, 
said she understood why he would want to keep his identity a secret. 
``If you want to write about your work in a way that's natural, and 
continue to have a natural relationship with your work environment, 
you have to keep your identity a secret,'' she said. ``Everything 
is changed by your exposure as a writer. I immediately understood 
that exposure would change this cop's relationship to his professional 
world. For the worst, I would say.'' No questions have been raised 
about the accuracy of Conlon's work. But a number of professors of 
journalism and media observers find the pseudonym troubling because 
it may cause the reader to wonder whether Conlon's articles are even 
the slightest bit fictional. Charles Eisendrath, a journalism professor 
at the University of Michigan, and James Naughton, president of the 
Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., said 
Conlon's use of a pseudonym might cause readers to doubt the truth 
of his reporting. ``When I read nonfiction work by a pseudonymous 
author, I wonder: is this literal truth, the journalistic truth or 
is it representational truth in a more fictionalized sense?'' Naughton 
said. Joan Konner, publisher of The Columbia Journalism Review and 
dean emeritus of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, 
agrees but goes further, saying it is wrong to keep Conlon's identity 
a secret from his co-workers because they play a part in his articles. 
``This makes me extremely uncomfortable as a matter of personal integrity,'' 
she said. On the other hand, Tom Goldstein, the dean of the Columbia 
Journalism School, said he trusted the editors of The New Yorker. 
``I think it is important to get firsthand accounts that a reporter 
could not get without resorting to subterfuge,'' he said. When David 
Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, inherited Conlon from his predecessor, 
Ms. Brown, he said he had no doubts about the author's reporting and 
decided to let him continue to use the pseudonym. ``I asked to meet 
him and be made confident that, of course, he is who he is and does 
what he does,'' Remnick said. ``The fact that he is a remarkable writer 
joined with this experience, which is very hard for an outsider to 
replicate, maybe even impossible, is just a glory, and we're all the 
richer for it.'' Christopher Knutsen, Conlon's editor at Riverhead, 
said he and the author had hardly discussed the issue and insisted 
that his use of Conlon's pseudonym was not a marketing tool. It is 
a ``literary persona,'' Knutsen said. ``This is about the author's 
personal wish to not have his life turned upside down,'' Knutsen said. 
``The other thing to point out is that the author is not blowing the 
lid on any police secrets. That's not the point of his book.'' Conlon 
did not answer requests for an interview. Now that Conlon's name has 
been made public, Remnick said he could ``not begin to speculate'' 
on whether he would suggest to Conlon that he use his real name.
