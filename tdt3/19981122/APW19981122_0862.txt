Finance ministers from the European Union's 11 left-leaning governments 
gathered Sunday to prepare for intensified economic policy coordination 
after the launch of the euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1. 
The ministers released a document entitled ``The New European Way,'' 
which outlines how the socialists plan to use their new ascendancy 
in the EU to make growth and job-creation the top economic priority. 
Left-of-center governments now run all but four of the EU's 15 nations, 
including the four largest - Germany, France, Italy and Britain. ``Our 
task is to find a way of marrying together an open, competitive and 
successful economy with a just and human society,'' the document says. 
``Central is the objective of reconstructing a full-employment society, 
a society in which there are job opportunities for all citizens.'' 
The drive for closer cooperation is spearheaded by Germany's new finance 
minister Oskar Lafontaine and his French counterpart Dominique Strauss-Kahn. 
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has lined up behind 
them, although Britain will be staying out of the euro project for 
now. Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired the meeting 
said the arrival of the euro heralded ``a new phase'' that obliged 
nations to cooperate on areas such as taxation, prices and wage policy. 
Sunday's meeting over dinner focused on taxes, said Lafontaine. The 
socialist ministers met on the eve of the regular monthly meeting 
of all 15 EU nations, the first for Lafontaine whose Social Democratic 
Party won elections in September. In their 11-page ``policy agenda'' 
the socialists support public spending on infrastructure and services 
and call for ``a social contract ... which gives to all citizens a 
stake in the development of the European economy.'' However the document 
also insists tight budgets are essential to underpin the euro's stability. 
It lists ``a commitment to monetary stability (and) sustained fiscal 
discipline'' as priorities. The socialists call on the new European 
Central Bank to take account of ``growth and employment'' as well 
as inflation when its starts setting interest rates for the euro bloc. 
But Lafontaine the socialists were not seeking to undermine on the 
bank's independence. ``We want a dialogue. In a democratic society, 
such a proposal for a dialogue is no threat for the ECB's independence,'' 
he told reporters after the meeting. EU ministers will be able to 
repeat their recent calls for lower rates Monday when they are joined 
by Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president. Despite the commitment 
to pool economic ideas, policy differences persist among socialists 
governments over labor market rules, taxes and public spending. Lafontaine 
has found scant support for his call for exchange rate targets to 
limit fluctuations between the euro and other major world currencies. 
``It won't be very soon that we'll have fixed relations between the 
currency blocs,'' Edlinger said. Socialist unity could be put to the 
test Monday, when ministers debate the EU budget. Germany insists 
it pays too much to the Union's coffers and wants a reluctant France 
and Italy to shoulder more of the burden.
