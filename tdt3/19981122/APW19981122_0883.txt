Marion Jones, who became the second fastest woman ever in the 100 
and 200 meters, and Haile Gebrselassie, who set four world records, 
were named Sunday as the IAAF athletes of the year. The American sprinter, 
who picked up the award for the second year in a row, dominated the 
100 meters, 200 meters and long jump and was an overwhelming choice 
for the women's prize. While vote totals were not released, Jones' 
closest competitors were believed to be French sprinter Christine 
Arron, the European champion at 100 and 200, and Irish distance runner 
Sonia O'Sullivan. The men's contest was much closer, with Gebrselassie 
edging Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who broke the 1,500-meter record. 
The awards were presented at the International Amateur Athletic Federation's 
annual gala in Monaco. ``I've had a wonderful season and this just 
tops it off,'' said Jones, who became the first woman in 50 years 
to win the 100, 200 and long jump at the USA Championships. The former 
University of North Carolina basketball star compiled an overall winning 
streak of 37 events that was snapped only when Heike Dreschler beat 
her in the long jump at the World Cup in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
Jones clocked 10.90 seconds or better in 20 races in the 100 and ran 
the fourth-fastest time ever _ 10.65 _ at the World Cup. The only 
woman in history to run faster is the late Florence Griffith Joyner, 
who holds the world record of 10.49. Jones also ran the third fastest 
200 meters in history, clocking 21.62 in Johannesburg. Only Griffith 
Joyner has run faster, including the world record of 21.34. Jones 
also won the women's overall IAAF Grand Prix title and was one of 
three athletes (along with Gebrselassie and El Guerrouj) to share 
the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot for going undefeated in her 
event. Jones, who got married on Oct. 3 to U.S. shot putter C.J. Hunter, 
said she is skipping the entire indoor season _ including the world 
indoor championships in Japan _ to concentrate on winning four gold 
medals (100, 200, long jump and relay) at next year's World Championships 
in Seville. Jones is targetting five gold medals (100, 200, long jump 
and two relays) at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Gebrselassie, meanwhile, 
continued to establish himself as one of the greatest distance runners 
in history as he went undefeated in 1998 from 1,500 to 10,000 meters. 
The diminutive Ethiopian set world indoor records at 2,000 and 3,000 
meters, and smashed the outdoor records at 5,000 and 10,000 . He also 
posted the year's fastest times in the 3,000. ``This has been the 
best year of my career,'' he said. ``I've dreamed of this athlete-of-the-year 
award for a long time.'' Gebrselassie said he thought he should have 
won the award in 1995 when he was edged out by British triple jumper 
Jonathan Edwards. Gebrselassie said he plans to run the 10,000 at 
the World Championships in Seville, but he wouldn't rule out doubling 
in the 5,000. He said he will also concentrate on breaking Kenyan 
Daniel Komen's world record in the 3,000. The IAAF festivities also 
included a lifetime achievement award for American heptathlete and 
long jumper Jackie Joyner Kersee, who retired this year after an 18-year 
career that included six Olymic medals and four world championship 
gold medals. There were also tributes to Griffith Joyner, who died 
in September at the age of 38 after suffering a seizure. Her husband, 
Al Joyner, and daughter, Mary, attended the gala.
