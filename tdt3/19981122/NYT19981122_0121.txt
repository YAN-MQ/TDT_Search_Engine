Since the case is about digital technology, it seems apt that the 
most heated debate in the Microsoft trial is about the virtual witness 
_ Bill Gates on videotape. The Billathon continued last week with 
the government using more taped excerpts of its deposition of Gates, 
the chairman and co-founder of Microsoft Corp. By now, with repetition, 
the Gates tapes have lost much of their punch to shock or amuse. The 
subject may vary, but each excerpted section is much the same. Hunched 
forward, staring down, like a student being punished in the principal's 
office, Gates comes off as forgetful, evasive and endlessly quibbling 
over the meaning of the simplest business terms like ``market share.'' 
The joke making the rounds in the industry is that it was the word 
``share'' that Gates found confusing. But the real issue surrounding 
Gates now becomes whether the virtual witness becomes a real one. 
Putting Gates on the stand presents a real risk for both sides. A 
convincing, disciplined performance by Gates _ who, according to opinion 
polls, remains an entrepreneurial hero to most Americans _ could bolster 
Microsoft's defense, legal experts say. Yet Microsoft's defense could 
be undermined if Gates proved a volatile witness, arrogant and unresponsive, 
coming off as a man with something to hide, legal experts agree. He 
is not on the 12-person witness list of either Microsoft or the government, 
but either side could call him. Each side is permitted to call two 
rebuttal witnesses. And Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who limited 
the witness lists in the interest of speeding the trial along, has 
indicated that his ground rules are flexible. Surely, Gates would 
be welcome on the stand in the U.S. District Court in Washington. 
But if he is to be a witness, it seems, it will have to be Microsoft 
that calls him. The government is certainly inviting the Microsoft 
legal team to take that risk. In his remarks during the daily news 
conferences on the courthouse steps last week, David Boies, the lead 
trial lawyer for the Justice Department, was just short of taunting. 
Asked whether he would call the Microsoft chairman as a witness, Boies 
said dryly, ``We have a deposition that we're very comfortable with.'' 
Gates appears to be irritated at the reaction to his deposition tapes. 
At the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas, he told The Associated 
Press that the prosecutors' use of the tapes was ``more about government 
PR than the substance of the case,'' and he accused Boies of trying 
``to put words in my mouth'' during the deposition. In Washington, 
Boies replied that Gates ``seems to be indicating more and more that 
he wants to come.'' Strongly suggesting that the Gates tapes are hurting 
Microsoft and that the company is losing the case, Boies added: ``It 
wouldn't be unusual to change the game plan if the present game plan 
isn't working. Maybe that's what you're seeing.'' Microsoft says that 
all this is ``spin'' and that Gates' deposition performance was a 
triumph of stonewalling. ``The substance of his deposition testimony 
has not helped the government's case,'' said Charles Rule, a former 
senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who 
is an adviser to Microsoft. The legal advice Gates received going 
into his deposition was clearly to give his adversaries little or 
nothing to work with. He may have done that to a fault, because he 
appears to be almost lifeless. The problem with the Gates tapes _ 
whether a legal one or not _ is that Gates does not come across as 
Bill Gates, brilliant, passionate about the technology he has championed 
and thoroughly in command of Microsoft. And that would seem to raise 
a credibility issue in the case. That view of the Gates tapes, Microsoft 
says, is uninformed, the reflex impression of people unschooled in 
the intricacies of the legal process. Depositions involve a lot of 
jousting over words and nit-picking. Still, with the Microsoft trial 
moving into its sixth week, six government witnesses have been cross-examined 
by Microsoft's lawyers. There has been plenty of pausing and parsing 
of words, but none of the witnesses has displayed the kind of white-knuckle 
resistance that Gates has demonstrated. Last Thursday, at a meeting 
in Jackson's chambers, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, protested 
the repeated showing of excerpts of the Gates tapes mainly ``for the 
purpose of creating news stories day after day after day,'' according 
to a transcript of the meeting. The judge disagreed. ``If anything,'' 
he said, ``the trouble is with your witness.'' Later, he added, ``I 
think it's evident that for whatever reasons, in many respects Gates 
has not been particularly responsive to his deposition interrogation.'' 
Still, as much as the Justice Department lawyers seem to be inviting 
Gates to show up, his appearance would be a risk for the government. 
There has been a difference of opinion between Boies and Stephen Houck, 
the lead trial lawyer for the 20 states that are suing Microsoft with 
the Justice Department. Houck has suggested that the government call 
Gates, but Boies, colleagues say, has said that is a risk for Microsoft 
to take. ``You don't call someone who is brilliant and totally committed 
to beating you,'' Boies was quoted as saying. ``The government's nightmare,'' 
said William Kovacic, a visiting professor at the George Washington 
University Law School, ``is that he comes on like Bill Gates, a guy 
with a deep conviction that what he is doing is right.'' What Gates 
did not do in his deposition, Kovacic said, was play the time-honored 
game of politicians, which is to ``sidestep the question and present 
your vision of the issue.'' Jackson has given the other witnesses 
plenty of leeway for lengthy yes-but answers. ``The judge would have 
to let Gates give speeches, because he has let everyone else do it,'' 
Kovacic said. ``If he didn't, Microsoft would clearly have a bullet 
to use on appeal, unmasking the judge's bias.'' Other antitrust experts, 
however, advise Microsoft to stay with its nine lower-level Microsoft 
witnesses and leave Gates out of the trial. ``I think it would be 
a mistake, especially with a litigator and cross-examiner as skilled 
as David Boies,'' said Stephen Axinn, a partner of Axinn, Veltrop 
&AMP; Harkrider. ``If Microsoft calls Gates, they're crazy.''
