The Vienna boys' choir is celebrating its 500th anniversary with special 
holiday performances around the world. Hundreds of well-wishers turned 
out at a party for the choir in Branson, missouri. The radio city 
music hall rockettes kicked off the celebration. The rockettes were 
in town performing their Christmas show. The Vienna boys' choir was 
created in Austria in 1498, and today includes two international touring 
groups. Those are the rockettes.
