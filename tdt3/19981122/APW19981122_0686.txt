Citing safety concerns amid rising tensions between Italy and Turkey, 
Juventus of Turin players said Sunday they do not want to play the 
club's upcoming Champions League match against Galatasaray in Istanbul. 
The countries are at odds over a Turkish Kurd rebel leader arrested 
in Rome last week. Feeling is running strong in Turkey over Italy's 
refusal to extradite Abdullah Ocalan for trial as a terrorist. European 
soccer's governing body, UEFA, is to render a decision Monday on where 
and when to play the game, scheduled for Wednesday. ``We players could 
decide not to go to Istanbul,'' Juventus captain Angelo Di Livio said. 
``We really don't want to risk our lives. ... We still hope that UEFA 
will move the game to a neutral site.'' General manager Luciano Moggi 
has acknowledged that safety is ``a big worry,'' and Juventus announced 
Friday that no fans will travel with the club if it plays in Istanbul. 
``Our refusal (to play) is a possibility that should not be dismissed,'' 
defender Gianluca Pessotto said. ``It is clear that in Istanbul Wednesday 
there will not be the right conditions for a soccer game. ... I don't 
see why we should take the risk.'' Juventus needs a victory against 
Galatasaray to keep alive its chances of qualifying for the quarterfinals. 
The Italian champions have reached the cup final three straight years.
