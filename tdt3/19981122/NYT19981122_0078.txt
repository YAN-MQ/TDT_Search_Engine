When David Letterman is bugged about something, he doesn't let it 
go easily. He begins ``The Late Show With David Letterman Fifth Anniversary 
Special'' by noting that this special celebrates ``Five years on CBS 
or, if I had played my cards right, 17 years on NBC.'' One of his 
mordant running jokes on ``The Late Show'' involves these linked annoyances 
in his career: losing the NBC ``Tonight'' show job to Jay Leno and, 
in the last couple of years, watching the CBS incarnation of his show 
struggle in the ratings as the network has floundered. That joke calls 
attention to an immutable truth: In the late-night battle, there is 
a great divide between Jay people, who are an easygoing, don't-challenge-me 
sort, and Dave people, always ready for a barbed remark amid the silly, 
absurdist situations. This special turns highlights of the last five 
years into 90 minutes with virtually no dull spots, and proves why 
Letterman is still consistently the best, funniest, sharpest late-night 
host. The show includes a new Top 10 List prepared for the anniversary, 
with guests lining up to share ``Things I Always Wanted to Say to 
Dave.'' The list includes New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mia Farrow, 
Michael J. Fox and Puff Daddy, who continues the ragging on CBS by 
telling his host, ``Of all the old guys on `60 Minutes' you're my 
favorite.'' Jerry Seinfeld also turns up with some surprising news 
about Dave's mom, as viewers affectionately know his mother. The funniest 
of the taped comedy bits features Letterman and Steve Martin in a 
home video capturing the tender moments, the lovers' spats, the frolicking 
on the beach of ``Dave and Steve's Gay Vacation.'' And a montage of 
interview snippets reveals how, with one wry glance at the camera, 
Letterman turns his guests' most bizarre behavior into humor. Watch 
for Farrah Fawcett's on-camera meltdown, Madonna's bleep-filled taunting, 
Drew Barrymore leaping on the desk and taking the term ``flash dance'' 
literally. There are also reminders that contrary to Letterman's acerbic 
reputation, some of the hysterical moments on ``Late Show'' come from 
loony, benign comedy, like Letterman putting on Shaquille O'Neal's 
jacket. Since he began losing to ``Tonight'' in the ratings, there 
have been nights when Letterman has not looked like a guy who enjoys 
his work much, leading his fans to fear he might call it quits sooner 
rather than later. This prime-time special reveals that a world without 
the Letterman show would be a world of extreme deprivation. PRODUCTION
