Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports." Saturday was rivalry day in college 
football. We'll get back to that in a moment. We begin at the top, 
where number one Tennessee had no trouble with kentucky. They crushed 
the Wildcats, 59-21. Shawn Bryson scored twice for the Vols, who are 
10-0 for the first time since 1956. Second-ranked K-state squeaked 
past Missouri, 31-25. Michael Bishop threw for a touchdown and ran 
for another. He also led the team with 105 yards on the ground. UCLA 
topped USC for the eighth straight time, 34-17. Freshman DeShaun Foster 
ran for 109 yards and tied a school record with 4 tds. Number five 
Florida state tomahawked the fourth-ranked gators, 23-12. A pregame 
powwow saw three players ejected before kickoff. Then it was the Peter 
Warrick show. The junior receiver threw for one td and was on the 
receiving end of another. John Cooper got some redemption as the number 
seven buckeyes beat 11th-ranked Michigan, 31-16. Joe germaine threw 
for three touchdowns. Neither team will be heading to the rose bowl, 
though. That honor goes to Wisconsin. The 13th-ranked badgers upended 
Penn state, 24-3, to notch their first pasadena appearance in five 
years. Nick Davis returned a punt 82 yards for a touchdown. Mississippi 
state slid past the ninth-ranked razorbacks, 22-21. Brian hazelwood's 
27-yard field goal with seven seconds left was the difference. If 
the bulldogs beat Ole miss next week, they will play Tennessee for 
the s.E.C. championship. Tenth-ranked notre dame slipped by LSU, 39-36. 
The Irish have an unblemished home record for the first time since 
1989. LSU had a chance to win it with one second left, but qb Craig 
nall's hail mary was incomplete.
