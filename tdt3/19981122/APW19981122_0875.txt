The Israeli government has allotted dlrs 12 million to upgrade security 
at the Temple Mount, fearing the site could be targeted by Jewish 
or Christian extremists, Israel radio reported. The Temple Mount is 
the third-holiest site in the Islamic religion, home to the Al Aqsa 
and Dome of the rock mosques. The additional money for pay for some 
400 policemen and security devices such as closed circuit cameras 
and sensor pads. The Temple Mount sits above Judaism's holiest site, 
the Western Wall, and is where Jews believed the Second Temple was 
located before it was destroyed in 70 AD. The area, located in the 
walled Old City of Jerusalem, is considered the most sensitive spot 
in the Mideast conflict and near the site of the crucifixion of Christ. 
An assault on the site would likely trigger violence and upset chances 
for a continuation of the peace process.
