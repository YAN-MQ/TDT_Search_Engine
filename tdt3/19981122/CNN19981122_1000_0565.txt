Is it progress, or a preservationist nightmare? Natalie pawelski tells 
us some residents on an island outside Toronto are fighting to save 
their homes. Minutes by Ferry from the hustle and commotion of Canada's 
biggest city, Toronto island is close to downtown, but also a world 
apart. It's very safe. You can let the kid move around freely. You 
don't have to be holding its hand every minute. I think when you live 
on an island, you do, you have to look right in your back yard to 
find what's interesting to you. And what's important to you. It's 
all right in your backyard. With no private cars and little crime, 
Toronto's island community is an urban place with a different pace. 
Even the mail delivery is different. But some say a plan to build 
a bridge to the island will destroy what makes the island unique. 
The city has begun to sprawl. It's sprawled north. It's sprawled east 
and west. It seems there's almost an inevitable push to push it south 
as well. The bridge is supposed to help an airport -- three miles 
away at the other end of the island -- boost air traffic. Residents 
worry a busier airport will be noisier and dirtier. And they say the 
bridge would make it harder for boaters to get to lake ontario. But 
supporters say building a bridge would allow emergency vehicles to 
get to the island more quickly, and make it easier to get from the 
airport to downtown. ' Ter the only city that has an paper where business, 
tourists can fly right within walking distance of major venues. The 
bridge won't be built anytime soon. Toronto's city council is still 
looking at how the project would affect boaters and the environment. 
Islanders say a bridge is only the latest threat to their community. 
In the 1950s, for example, the city was planning to turn this neighborhood 
into a park. The sirens that used to rally residents when the wrecking 
crews moved in still stand. So does the drive to save this place, 
as is. It should be preserved because people love it so much. People 
have been willing to stick around here and fight for it for a Generation.
