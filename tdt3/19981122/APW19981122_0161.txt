Some 60 Assyrian Christians have occupied a Zurich church in support 
of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, city police said Sunday. 
The group of men, women and children entered the Fraumuenster church 
in the heart of the old town Saturday afternoon, announcing they intended 
to start a hunger strike aimed at preventing Ocalan's extradition 
from Italy to Turkey. Church officials abandoned attempts to have 
them forcibly removed after two men doused themselves with gasoline. 
The group identified itself as belonging to the ``Bethnahrin Patriotic 
Revolutionary Organization.'' Assyrians are recognized as a minority 
in Turkey. Ocalan was freed in Rome Saturday amid a barrage of protests 
from Turkey, which wants him handed over as a terrorist. Leaving the 
hospital where he'd been in custody, he told the thousands of Kurds 
from throughout Europe who came to Rome in his support to return home. 
Ocalan was freed by a court decision Friday rejecting a Turkish warrant 
for his arrest because Italian law forbids extradition to countries 
where someone faces the death penalty. The court said Ocalan had to 
stay in Rome, but that order could be lifted next month.
