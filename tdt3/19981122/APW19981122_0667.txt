Leftist activists and proponents of African unity paid revolutionary 
tributes Sunday at the funeral of Kwame Ture, the 1960s radical who 
under his original name Stokely Carmichael spread the cry of ``Black 
Power'' throughout the United States and the world. Ture, one of the 
most prominent figures of the civil rights movement and a man whose 
shifting politics took him from the non-violence of the freedom riders 
to angry calls for armed revolt and eventually to pan-African unity, 
died last Sunday of prostate cancer at age 57. He had spent nearly 
his entire adult life preaching socialist upheaval, living for what 
he called ``the movement'' long after he had become a fringe figure 
and his radical contemporaries had abandoned the cause. ``Kwame is 
a struggler. He struggled all his life, he struggled until the last 
second of the last minute of the last hour of the last day,'' Bob 
Brown, a longtime Ture friend told about 400 cheering people at a 
memorial service at Conakry's Gamal Abdel Nasser University. Speakers, 
some aging radicals in graying dreadlocks, paid homage to Ture under 
a banner that read: ``The CIA gave me cancer. Kwame Ture.'' Conrad 
Worrill, chairman of the U.S.-based Black United Front, praised Ture 
for his early efforts at fostering pride in African heritage. ``Kwame 
Ture made us realize we were no longer just negroes, we were African. 
We now know that even if we were born American, we are all African,'' 
he said, ending his speech with Ture's own motto: ``Ready for the 
revolution!'' Leftist rhetoric inundated the memorial, with Guinean 
politicians and American activists invoking the rallying cries of 
the 1960s. Again and again they decried imperialism, capitalism and 
reactionary politics and praised the socialist vanguard fighting for 
the revolution. ``We send our revolutionary condolences to the family 
of comrade Kwame Ture,'' Macheo Shabaka, a member of Ture's All-African 
People's Revolutionary Party, said in a typical statement. Although 
Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and Ture's 
first ex-wife, the South African singer Miriam Makeba had been asked 
to come, no such highly prominent figures attended. Instead, about 
400 people _ including Libyan and Cuban diplomats and an array of 
former comrades of Ture's activist days _ assembled in an outdoor 
pavilion. Ture's wooden coffin lay on a table, upon which hung a large 
photograph of himself flanked by pictures of his self-chosen namesakes, 
Guinea's Sekou Toure and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah. Later, he was buried 
in a public cemetery. His 17-year-old son, Bocar, sobbed as the red 
clay was shoveled onto the coffin. ``I know that today my father is 
very happy, happy because he will remain in Guinea,'' the teen-aged 
boy had said earlier at the memorial. Ture began his political career 
began as a college student in the 1960s, helping integrate public 
transportation in the American South as a freedom rider. He soon became 
one of the most fiery figures of the era, popularizing the term ``Black 
Power'' and changing the way the once-nonviolent civil rights movement 
was viewed. He headed the Student Nonviolent Co-ordinating Committee, 
an important center of activism and the civil rights movement, and 
later became honorary prime minister of the Black Panthers. Angered 
by Panther moves to ally with white radicals, Carmichael left the 
group, changed his name and moved to Guinea in 1968, invited by Toure, 
then the country's brutal Marxist dictator. Ture quickly moved to 
the political fringes and was soon largely forgotten except for his 
`60s activism. He spent the rest of his life lecturing and writing, 
preaching black power and championing socialism and pan-African unity. 
But often forgotten Sunday in the long stream of political rhetoric 
was the human side of the fierce socialist campaigner, a man well 
known to friends for his gentleness. In the audience, Beverly Sylla, 
an American teacher married to a Guinean, spoke privately about how 
Ture would cheer her up while her son was dying of cancer. ``He wasn't 
just about politics. He was caring, he was human. And they need to 
say that,'' she said gesturing towards the podium.
