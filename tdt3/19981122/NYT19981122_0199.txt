The New York Jets had won six of seven games and four in a row and 
then crashed last week at Indianapolis. Lesson learned. The Tennessee 
Oilers had won five of six and three in a row and then crashed here 
Sunday against the Jets. Lesson learned? For the Oilers, maybe. It 
was, indeed, a painful punch. A 3-3 game at halftime turned into a 
24-3 Jets rout here at Vanderbilt Stadium. At times, the Oilers looked 
confused, dispirited, spun in their own mess and, well, they looked 
like the team that usually plays here, the college edition, the 2-8 
Vanderbilt Commodores. The Oilers ran 53 plays and averaged 4.2 yards 
a play and seemed to be running while tied to a tree. They punted 
seven times and for nearly the final 33 minutes of the game did not 
score a point. In the first quarter, they gained seven yards and ran 
three plays and had the ball for a measly 1 minute 20 seconds. That 
meant the Jets had it for the other 13:40 of the quarter. And though 
the Oilers righted themselves and produced a better second quarter 
on offense, the bottom line was the Oilers defense was going to tire 
in the second half. After all of that first-half effort, the Oilers 
defense was likely going to be burned because of overload. And this, 
too: Somewhere in the second half of a game tied 3-3 at halftime, 
one team is likely going to put its staple on the affair. Its imprint. 
One team will likely crack the vault, pick the lock, blow open the 
door. That team was the Jets. ``It was 3-3 and we had a great shot 
to win it,'' said the Oilers running back Eddie George. ``They made 
it happen. They cracked it.'' Not only did the Jets crack it, they 
owned it. They made the Oilers, in the end, look inept. Nothing like 
the team that had been streaking so boldly in the last three weeks 
with two victories over Pittsburgh and a victory at Tampa Bay. Several 
Oilers talked later about how the Jets appeared to know too much about 
them. They said it was as if the Jets had been in their practices 
all week and in their huddles during the game. ``We had a good game 
plan,'' said Jeff Fisher, the Oilers' coach. ``Obviously, they had 
a good game plan.'' This was the Jets' plan: Tackle well, stop the 
run and contain the quarterback, Steve McNair. Allow him little mobility 
and no wild, running scrambles for big yards or touchdowns. The Jets 
offense left the Oilers defense shaking its head, too. ``For six or 
seven games now, those guys on offense have come out and showed something 
different from what they had done the previous week,'' said the Oilers 
safety Marcus Robertson. ``They kept us off balance. They seemed to 
attack us where we were weakest. It was second-and-11 and they gave 
us a balanced set with no back. And then that turned into four wideouts. 
We'd be in a defense that didn't account for that. ``It was that kind 
of day, especially in the second half. They spread us out and then 
threw a barrage of formations at us. And, to top it off, we just didn't 
play well.'' When a game is 3-3 at halftime and the teams have felt 
each other's pulse for a half, checking this, checking that, the outcome, 
the second half, is likely going to swing on coaching. Who cracks 
the vault first. Coaching and then, from the players, will power and 
execution and maturity. ``We have some of the best coaches to ever 
coach in this league, all-time,'' said Chris Hayes, the Jets' special-teams 
ace. That is a bluster of hype. But in this season, at least, the 
Jets coaches in big games have run extremely well on the fly. And 
the players have responded to lift the Jets to a 7-4 record with five 
regular-season games left. The Oilers are now 6-5. ``We didn't do 
anything to make a difference in this ballgame,'' Fisher said. ``We 
came into the locker room tied at halftime and allowed them to put 
21 unanswered points on the board and obviously that was the difference. 
You have to make plays. You have to score touchdowns. You have to 
convert third downs and get off the field on third downs and we didn't 
do any of that.'' He said his team had a nice run. It is over. Now 
to make the playoffs they need another run. Another string of victories. 
The Jets have been there. A string. A stumble. Getting cracked. It 
is the Oilers turn now, thanks to the Jets. ``This is a good team 
and we needed a win like this,'' said the Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn. 
Both teams need more to make the playoffs. Something solid. No cracks.
