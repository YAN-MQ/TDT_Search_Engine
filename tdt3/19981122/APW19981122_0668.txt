Kate Winslet, star of the Oscar-winning movie ``Titanic,'' was married 
Sunday to assistant film director Jim Threapleton in a quiet ceremony 
at her family's local church. About 150 guests, including actress 
Emma Thompson and actor Greg Wise, attended the afternoon wedding 
at All Saints' Church in Reading, southern England. After the half-hour 
service the 23-year-old actress, in a white Edwardian-style gown, 
posed briefly for photographs with her new husband, 25, who wore a 
suit with a dark frock coat. ``The whole thing was tremendously relaxed 
and happy. It was a big success story today,'' said the Rev. John 
Mortiboys, who conducted the service. ``They were trying to keep everything 
as secret as possible because you can imagine what it is like in the 
glare of the publicity all of the time,'' he said.
