Dariush Foruhar, an opposition figure and former labor minister, was 
stabbed to death Sunday along with his wife at their Tehran home, 
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. It was not clear 
who killed Foruhar and his wife or what their motive may have been, 
the agency said. It said police were investigating the deaths. Foruhar 
was the leader of the People's Party of Iran, a small opposition group 
in Iran that is tolerated by the government. He served as minister 
of labor and social affairs in the provisional government of Prime 
Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately after the 1979 Islamic Revolution 
that toppled the monarchy.
