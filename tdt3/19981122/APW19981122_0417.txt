The widow of South African author Alan Paton, whose book ``Cry The 
Beloved Country'' became a seminal work on the oppression of blacks 
in the apartheid era, says she is emigrating because of lawlessness 
under black rule. ``I love this country with a passion, but I cannot 
live here any more,'' Anne Paton, 71, wrote in an article in The Sunday 
Times. ``There is now more racial tension in this country than I have 
ever known. But it is not just about black-on-white crime. It is about 
general lawlessness. The black people are suffering more than the 
whites.'' British-born Mrs. Paton went to South Africa with her first 
husband in 1963. She married Paton, 25 years her senior, in 1969 after 
his first wife died and she divorced her first husband, also a South 
African. Paton, South Africa's best-known white liberal author, wrote 
``Cry The Beloved Country'' in 1950, a novel about a black priest 
in search of his son who is wanted by police for the murder of a white 
man. It became a bestseller in South Africa and around the world almost 
immediately, has sold more than 15 million copies in 20 languages 
and was made into a musical ``Lost in the Stars.'' Mrs. Paton, who 
will return to Britain, wrote that she is glad that her husband, who 
worked throughout his life for black majority rule in South Africa, 
is not alive now. He died in 1988, six years before the country's 
first all-race elections ended white rule and brought President Nelson 
Mandela's African National Congress to power. ``He would have been 
so distressed to see what has happened to his beloved country,'' wrote 
Mrs. Paton. She described a series of violent attacks on herself, 
on friends, and on other elderly whites who live near her home outside 
the port city of Durban. She said her car was hijacked at gunpoint 
outside her local post office. Six months ago a gang broke into her 
home, almost throttled her, threatened to kill her, gagged her and 
ransacked the house. A few weeks ago, two men tried to batter their 
way into her house using a hammer. She pressed a panic button, one 
was caught and was later released by a magistrate who said that ``banging 
on my door was not an offense, and how could I prove his intent was 
hostile?'' wrote Mrs. Paton. The Sunday Times said that between 250,000 
and 500,000 whites have left South Africa since 1994. Census results 
released last month said 11 percent of South Arica's 40.58 million 
people are white.
