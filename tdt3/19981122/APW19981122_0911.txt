A key advisor to Pauline Hanson's right-wing One Nation party said 
Monday he is standing by his claim that Australian Aboriginals were 
cannibals. Faced with threats of legal action, One Nation political 
advisor David Oldfield said he welcomed moves by Aboriginal activist 
Charlie Perkins to take the matter to the Australian Human Rights 
Commission. On Saturday, Oldfield, outside a polling station to support 
One Nation candidate Kate Taylor in the election for the federal seat 
of Newcastle, north of Sydney, said: ``They (Aborigines) have been 
killing and eating each other for 40,000 years.'' He made the comment 
as an aside to Ms. Taylor as she and another party's supporter argued 
about One Nation's opposition to special benefits for Aborigines. 
The comment was recorded by television cameras. On Monday, Oldfield 
told the Channel Nine television network he was not disappointed the 
comment had become the pinpoint of the election. ``I think it will 
more and more expose to the Australian people the lies that have been 
shoved down their throats for years in this way of trying to create 
benefits for the Aboriginal people,'' he said.
