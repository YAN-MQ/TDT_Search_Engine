President Clinton is warning of what he calls "signs of danger" from 
north korea. He spoke today to U.S. troops deployed along south Korea's 
border with the north. Mr. Clinton listed reasons to remain vigilant, 
including recent incursions from north Korea, missile tests and the 
building of a suspected underground nuclear installation. He said 
the United States will continue to press north Korea to take steps 
for peace and security. North Korea must maintain its free zone and 
move ahead to dismantle its nuclear weapons program as it has agreed 
to do. It must comply with its obligations under the nuclear, nonproliferation 
treaty. It must halt its effort to develop and proliferate chemical 
and biological weapons and ballistic missiles. We will continue to 
press north Korea to take these steps for peace and security, but 
until it fully commits itself to a constructive role on this peninsula, 
we must remain ready. After visiting with U.S. troops, Mr. Clinton 
headed back to Seoul for the night. Tomorrow, he heads to Guam before 
returning to Washington.
