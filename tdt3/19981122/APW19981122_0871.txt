Hillary Rodham Clinton visited U.S.-supported hospitals in Haiti Sunday, 
one of the few encouraging signs in a country rescued by the United 
States from dictatorship but not from poverty. Mrs. Clinton was winding 
up a tour of hurricane-ravaged Central American and Caribbean countries 
where she promised more disaster relief. She was to return home later 
Sunday. In Haiti, she announced the United States would add another 
dlrs 2.1 million to a dlrs 12 million storm relief package. But she 
focused her visit on health care in Haiti, the poorest country in 
the Western Hemisphere. Mrs. Clinton toured the Bienfaisance Hospital 
in Pignon, a small northern farming town of 20,000 people, and complimented 
the facilities more than 500 midwives for saving mothers' lives. ``What 
you're doing is very important,'' she said. In Pignon, only 190 of 
every 100,000 mothers die in childbirth, much lower than the national 
rate of 456 per 100,000. The United States gives the program dlrs 
700,000 a year. Also enthusiastic about the program was farmer Dereus 
Marcellus, who was among more than 100 residents who greeted Mrs. 
Clinton, who had arrived in Haiti on Saturday. Marcellus, 33, said 
his wife died several years ago while giving birth to their seventh 
child, who also died. ``The hospital was going to teach us family 
planning. It was too late,'' he said. ``His case is typical. That's 
why we need to move medical education out of the capital and into 
the countryside,'' said Dr. Arthur Fournier, professor of family medicine 
at the University of Miami School of Medicine, which will provide 
technical assistance to a new medical education program. The dlrs 
1 million pilot phase, with Bienfaisance Hospital as its center, will 
be also financed by a Soros foundation of Soros. Forty percent of 
Haiti's 8 million people have no access to health care and 75 percent 
have no access to family planning services. One child in eight does 
not live to the age of 5, the highest rate in the hemisphere. One 
in three is chronically malnourished. Critics strongly objected when 
President Clinton sent 20,000 U.S. troops to Haiti in 1994 to end 
a military dictatorship and halt a flood of boat people into Florida. 
Four years later, hopes that the U.S. intervention would bring a better 
life to the poverty-ridden nation have dimmed. The government has 
been nearly paralyzed by a power struggle that some fear could bring 
a return to dictatorship. Most foreign aid has been held up because 
of the 18-month political stalemate and foreign investors shun the 
country.
