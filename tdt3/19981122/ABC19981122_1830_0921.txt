Doctors in Russia today say there's a good chance a political aide 
who was shot and wounded Friday will pull through. He is the only 
eyewitness to the attack which killed a popular member of the Russian 
parliament. The assassination shocked a country that has seen more 
of its share of high-profile murders lately. Here is ABC's clay Scott. 
Today, hundreds of Russians paid their respects to gallina staravoitova, 
the country's leading female politician. Even a group of communists 
and their allies, her political opponents, observed a minute of silence 
in her memory. And the story of her murder dominated Russian television. 
As a deputy in Russia's parliament, staravoitova was known for her 
vocal opposition to communists and radical nationalists. Earlier this 
month, she led the effort to censure a communist deputy for his anti-semitic 
remarks. "A brilliant politician was killed," said Yegor gaidor, former 
prime minister. "I'm absolutely convinced it was a political murder." 
Most Russians agree, and that's what makes the assassination of staravoitova 
different. In the world of Russian politics and finance, the violent 
settling of scores has become almost commonplace. Russia now sees 
an estimated 600 contract murders every year. Few are ever solved. 
But the death of gallina staravoitova has touched people here. Hers 
was not another sordid political murder, Russians say. Gallina staravoitova 
was killed for what she believed. This is a political climate in which 
the borderline between crime and politics is thinning, and at some 
levels there is no borderline at all. President Boris Yeltsin has 
vowed to do everything in his power to bring staravoitova's killers 
to justice. And he appealed to Russia's political factions not to 
take advantage of her death and further polarize a country already 
in turmoil. Clay Scott, ABC News, Moscow.
