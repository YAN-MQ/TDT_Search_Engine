To week 12 of the NFL. The cards putting their hopes on a wildcard 
spot are playing the Redskins. The 8-2 falcons at home with the bears. 
Atlanta trying to avoid a let down against 3-7 Chicago the lions running 
with the Bucs. Tampa bay will be without hardy nickerson for at least 
four weeks with a Heart condition. He is expected to make a full recovery. 
The Packers visiting the Vikings. Green bay looking to avenge an October 
5th loss to Minnesota. The Colts playing the bills. The jags taking 
on the steelers, the home team has won all 6 previous games in this 
series. The Eagles and giants. Kent Graham starting in place of Danny 
kanell and Seattle runs with Dallas. Coming up later, the raiders 
will try to ruin the Broncos plan of a perfect season. Denver atop 
the AFC west at 10-0. The second place raiders 7-3. Our confidence 
is up there, and we're ready to play, man, and we're going to try 
to make a good showing. It'll be tough playing in mile high, and the 
bottom line, we like to play teams like this because we know, if we 
make a slip, they'll run us out of the stadium. We have to have our 
guns cocked and go out there blazing. We can't say we can go ten points 
down of these guys and come back. I know, you know, they got up on 
us last time and we had a tum turnovers and came back, but they're 
really rolling on offense and no matter who the quarterback is, we 
need to find a way to go out and silence the crowd, number one, because 
if we can do that, I think that will help us out tremendously.
