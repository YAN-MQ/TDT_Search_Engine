Good evening. Another standoff is building in Iraq. Last weekend, 
Iraq avoided a military strike that was just minutes away by pledging 
"full cooperation" with U.N. inspectors. This weekend, those inspectors 
are arguing once again over access, this time to documents. The Iraqis 
say the inspectors are asking the impossible and trying to give the 
U.S. an excuse to attack. They say they will bring the issue before 
the U.N. security council tomorrow. We begin with ABC's Morton dean 
in Baghdad. Good evening. The Iraqi crisis is back in a very familiar 
and potentially explosive place. This evening, Iraq's foreign minister 
rejected the U.N.'s latest demand for documents about weapons production. 
We have handed over all -- all available documents to UNSCOM. The 
combative foreign minister claimed his country had already provided 
UNSCOM with over 688,000 pages of documents. He and other government 
officials have complained the U.N. is asking for documents and diaries 
that have been seen before, have never existed, have been destroyed 
or which exceed the mandate of the inspections. The anti-U.S., anti-U.N. 
criticism came in a torrent today, deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz 
accusing chief arms inspector Richard Butler of raising new issues, 
possibly to stall a U.N. review of the sanctions. He's either creating 
a superficial pretext to justify the American aggression, or he is 
trying to confuse and undermine the comprehensive review. And the 
government-controlled press also weighed in, referring to "The corrupt 
rulers of America, rulers with sick dreams." Earlier, Iraq had indicated 
it would permit inspection of one document deemed crucial by the U.N., 
but there are conditions attached. And that is possibly a violation 
of the "no conditions" agreement reached last weekend which saved 
Iraq from a punishing military strike. Morton dean, ABC News, Baghdad.
