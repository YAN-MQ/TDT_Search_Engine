Slovenians went to the polls Sunday, in municipal elections that are 
expected to reflect their wish to maintain the status-quo of progress 
toward joining the European Union and NATO. Though the municipal vote 
is not directly linked to national politics, results are likely to 
show the nation's satisfaction with their national government. It 
is expected that the strongest party in the governing coalition, the 
Liberal Democratic Party, will maintain its status as strongest on 
the municipal level as well. But its coalition partners, the Peoples 
Party, may pay the penalty of a series of scandals within its ranks 
with a drop in support. The Liberal Democrats look set to collect 
some 25 percent of the vote, the Social Democrats, the strongest opposition 
party, 16 percent, and the United List of Democrats about 13 percent. 
The People's Party, which came second in 1996 parliamentary elections, 
should place fourth, with about 9 percent according to the polls. 
Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. local time (0600 GMT) and will close 
12 hours later, with the first preliminary results possible late in 
the day. Altogether, 189 municipalities are part of the vote. General 
elections are scheduled for 2000.
