It has been a truly horrible year for OPEC, and bets are it will continue 
that way. As oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries began heading to Vienna on Sunday for a meeting later in 
the week, Algeria's oil minister Yousef Yousfi went on a four-nation 
Gulf tour to brainstorm on how to boost prices. OPEC has a ``price 
crisis'' on its hands, Yousfi said Saturday in Kuwait, his first stop. 
Also on Yousfi's initerary were Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United 
Arab Emirates, all OPEC members. ``We're studying all ways and solutions 
that would boost the prices,'' Yousfi said, calling for ``collective 
measures to favor all (oil) countries,'' without elaborating. Oil 
ministers from the 11-member organization will meet in Vienna on Wednesday 
with oil prices hovering around 9 dollars below their group's target 
of dlrs 21 a barrel. Non-OPEC Russia, Mexico and Oman have also been 
invited. Most analysts say the choice facing OPEC is whether to agree 
to more output reductions in an effort to boost prices, or opt to 
extend current cuts. OPEC is split on the issue, and analysts are 
betting they won't agree on further cuts, but instead extend present 
cuts through to the end of 1999. Indicating just how bad things are, 
December crude oil closed in New York on Friday at dlrs 12.14 a barrel, 
nudging 11-year lows again after hitting a 12-year low in June. An 
ill-judged decision last winter to increase oil production fed into 
Asia's financial crisis, which slashed demand from there by about 
half and had a knock-on effect in world economies. The result _ a 
global oil glut. Faced with oversupply and slipping demand, OPEC agreed 
to cut production in June, keeping 2.6 million barrels a day from 
the market. The agreement is set to run for one year. OPEC output 
totals about 24.3 million barrels a day. But the effect on prices 
has been negligible, with some analysts pointing out there's just 
too much oil around for cuts to make a short-term difference. OPEC 
has been split into factions over the last few months. Kuwait and 
Algeria keen for more cuts, but Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC 
Mexico opposing them. Saudi Arabia produces 8 million barrels a day, 
the biggest quota in the organization. Both it and Venezuela are worried 
about losing market share to other producers, especially in the United 
States. Venezuela even hinted last week it may not stick to the current 
cut in production. While low prices are good news for consumers, many 
OPEC states are facing potentially serious situations back home. In 
Saudi Arabia, where oil provides over 70 percent of the national income, 
economic growth this year will drop to a negligible 0.3 percent compared 
to 7 percent in 1997, a banking and ratings agency said Saturday. 
``For every one dollar fall in the oil price, it is estimated that 
the country loses in the vicinity of dlrs 2.5 billion in budget revenues,'' 
Cyprus-based Capital Intelligence said in a report. With average prices 
falling from dlrs 18 in 1997 to around dlrs 12, Saudi Arabia can expect 
just dlrs 26 billion in oil export revenues, 24 percent below budget, 
the agency said. Kuwait's state-run news agency said last week it 
expected oil revenue for 1998 to be 45 percent lower than last year.
