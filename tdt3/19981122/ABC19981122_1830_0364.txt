President Clinton today warned about the growing danger in another 
potential flash point. He visited U.S. troops keeping the peace along 
one of the world's most hostile borders. ABC's Ann Compton is with 
the president in south Korea. President Clinton spent the entire day 
with 35,000 American troops on duty in south Korea. He shared an early 
Thanksgiving dinner of freeze-dried MREs, meals ready to eat. He even 
chimed in on a birthday greeting for one veteran Gi. Happy birthday 
to you 77 There is a serious concern here that north Korea may have 
revived its nuclear weapons program, trying to hide it at an underground 
site. The north is also testing more powerful missiles and sending 
spy ships into south Korean waters. President Clinton called it a 
most dangerous battleground, just like Iraq. Our ability to succeed 
in promoting peace is uniquely due to the fact that we can back up 
our diplomatic efforts when necessary with military strength. The 
U.S. is not treating north Korea as a crisis, at least not yet. The 
new hard-line comes just as there had been signs that the north was 
beginning to open up. President Clinton was particularly impressed 
that a south Korean cruise ship docked back in port today from a first-ever 
tourist visit, an emotional return to north Korea by some families 
separated since Korea was divided decades ago. President Clinton insisted 
tourism would prove far more valuable to north korea than nuclear 
weapons. Ann Compton, ABC News, Seoul, south Korea.
