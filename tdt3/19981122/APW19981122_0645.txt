Britain's Prince Charles arrived in Athens Sunday for a three-day 
official visit focused on cultural ties with Greece. Charles will 
attend events at an annual Britain and Greece festival, and help fund 
raising efforts for the British School of archaeology here. He will 
also open a British Council education center in Athens. A frequent 
private visitor to Greece, his last official trip here was back in 
1964. Before leaving on Tuesday, Charles will meet with President 
Costis Stephanopoulos and will tour the Acropolis and ancient sites 
on the island of Crete.
