President Jiang Zemin left China Sunday for consecutive visits to 
Russia, where he is to meet with the ailing president, Boris Yeltsin, 
and Japan, for the first visit ever by a Chinese head of state. Jiang's 
visit to Russia is the latest of several summit meetings between the 
giant neighbors, who appear determined to foster friendly ties despite 
a history of bitter feuding. At a meeting in Beijing last year, China 
_ which remains a Communist dictatorship _ and Russia _ which under 
Yeltsin overthrew Communism _ declared a ``strategic partnership.'' 
It was part of an effort by both countries to balance the influence 
of the United States in Asia. But China recognizes that its relations 
with the West, especially the United States, are far more important 
to its development in the years ahead. Jiang also has made an agreement 
with President Clinton to build a strategic partnership. The Russians, 
their economy flat on its back, are hoping for more profitable ties. 
``Economic cooperation should be upgraded from simple trade patterns 
to large-scale cooperation,'' Russia's ambassador to China, Igor Rogachev, 
said last week. Trade between the two countries has declined this 
year and is only a small fraction of the volume of China's trade with 
the United States or Japan. Its main driving force these days seems 
to be China's purchase of Russian fighter jets, submarines and other 
weapons as it seeks to upgrade its backward armed forces. Jiang will 
reportedly offer humanitarian aid to the Russians, a reversal from 
the 1950s _ before a bitter split _ when Soviet advisers tried to 
help China build a socialist state. Yeltsin and Jiang also expect 
to celebrate the completion of a border agreement, essentially finished 
last year, demarcating the common 2,700-mile border that was the site 
of conflicts in the 1960s. On Nov. 25, Jiang will fly to Japan for 
five days. Although China and Japan have many economic ties, they 
remain wary neighbors. China still nurses grievances from the brutal 
Japanese occupation of much of its territory in the 1930s and 1940s, 
and worries that Japan will be drawn into U.S. plans for the possible 
defense of Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province. In the 
last few weeks the Chinese have engaged in unusual public diplomacy, 
with officials expounding on the need for Japan to issue its most 
forthright apology ever for its past sins. In a visit to Tokyo earlier 
this month, the South Korean president received a clear apology from 
the Japanese and Japanese officials suggested that they would do the 
same for China. But that has not stopped Chinese officials from dwelling 
on the matter. It is not clear what the practical consequences of 
a stronger apology would be, but the issue is clearly a sensitive 
one in the Chinese psyche. ``Every now and then, some Japanese political 
figures will jump up to deny the country's past aggression in China,'' 
China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, said last week. ``Japan has 
never completely abandoned its militarist past in the same way as 
Germany has with the Nazis.'' China is also pressing Japan to make 
a clear public statement about the status of Taiwan, much as Clinton 
did during his visit to China last summer when he reiterated the opposition 
of the United States to formal Taiwanese independence. China worries 
that under the U.S.-Japanese security agreement, Japan might get involved 
in defending Taiwan from attack. It has also objected to plans to 
allow Taiwan to participate in a U.S.-Japanese research project on 
anti-missile defenses.
