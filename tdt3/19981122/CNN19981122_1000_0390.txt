More protests are expected today outside the fort benning military 
post in columbus, Georgia. Hundreds of protesters rallied yesterday 
to demand the closing of the U.S. army school of Americas. They called 
it the "school of the assassins," claiming that's where Latin american 
soldiers learn torture. The annual protest began in 1990, a year after 
the murders of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador. The school of Americas 
trained 19 of the 26 salvadoran officials implicated by a U.N. investigation 
of those killings.
