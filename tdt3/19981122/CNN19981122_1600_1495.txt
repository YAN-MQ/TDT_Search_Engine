About 1,000 Palestinians turned out at a Gaza theater for a unique 
performance of the opera "Carmen." Palestinian children from Gaza's 
refugee camps played the chorus. French singers provided the main 
roles. The opera is the tragic tale of a Gypsy girl who steals the 
hearts of men in her city. The chorus of children play Gypsy kids 
who love Carmen and follow her everywhere she goes.
