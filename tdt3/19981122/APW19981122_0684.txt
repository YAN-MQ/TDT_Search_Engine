Finn Christian Jagge, the 1992 Olympic champion, took advantage of 
an early start number to lead the first run of men's World Cup slalom 
on Sunday. After three days of sunny weather, the Park City Mountain 
Resort was caught in a snowstorm Sunday and it only got worse as the 
first run progressed. Jagge, 32, started second and placed first in 
50.26 seconds, .18 faster than the day's No. 1 starter, Jure Kosir 
of Slovenia. Olympic champion Hans-Petter Buraas led another trio 
of Norwegians in third, .22 seconds behind. Ole Kristian Furuseth, 
second behind Buraas in the 1998 Olympics at Nagano, Japan, was fourth 
in 50.91, .01 faster than 1994 World Cup overall champion Kjetil Andre 
Aamodt. Six Norwegians started in the top 16 and four cracked the 
top five, with 1996 overall champion Lasse Kjus, the 16th racer, taking 
12th, 1.57 behind. The other Norwegian, 1997 world slalom champion 
Tom Stiansen, failed to complete the first run. Christian Mayer of 
Austria was sixth in 50.99, followed by Germany's Markus Eberle in 
51.34. Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, runner-up the last two years 
to teammate Thomas Sykora in the World Cup slalom standings, was eighth 
in 51.48. Sykora didn't start because of a bruised knee. Sebastian 
Amiez of France was ninth in 51.50 and Austria's Olympic combined 
champion, Mario Reiter, rounded out the top 10 in 51.53, sharing the 
position with Canada's Thomas Grandi. Grandi was the only North American 
to crack the top 30 and qualify for the second run, scheduled for 
later Sunday.
