Good evening. The oldest man in space was feeling a bit more down-to-earth 
today. 77-year-old John Glenn and the shuttle "discovery" crew were 
talking for the first time about their historic mission. After a good 
night's sleep, Glenn said he was feeling much better than when the 
shuttle landed yesterday, but he will undergo three weeks of medical 
tests. NBC's Bob hagar tonight on the hero's welcome home. First full 
day back, John Glenn and the others, a little steadier on their feet 
today. I'm probably 95% or 98% back to normal now. Main gear touch 
koun. a contrast to the first moments after the shuttle touched down 
yesterday -- I was not at my best gait yesterday. a fact that became 
evident when Glenn finally appeared for the traditional walk around 
the shuttle. Wasn't easy, he said today. I wanted to do the walk-around 
with the rest of the crew. My determination was on my hands and knees 
if I was gonna do it. It's a funny feeling to have to walk straddle 
legged, not turn your head. You're alligator head, you're locked in 
like this. You don't want to turn your head too much outside your 
normal body motions. But after retiring with other astronauts, yesterday, 
Glenn said he finally slept like a log. Great, after sleeping eight 
nights in the weightlessness of space. Up there you put a pillow under 
your head so you have the sensation like it is on earth. Last night, 
it was down on that pillow, solid up there, one left floats. One leg 
was really down on the other. So you notice little differences like 
that. Late today, the crew, welcomed back to astronaut headquarters 
in houston -- a rousing reception, and with Glenn's wife annie looking 
on, a Tribute from crewmate Scott parazynski. I think the most exciting 
discovery we made aboard STS 95, was the discovery of the fountain 
of youth. If any of you were to look at John Glenn's birth certificate, 
you might conclude that he is 77 years of age. But on orbit, let me 
tell you, was not a day over 22. As for John Glenn, he hopes his Odyssey 
in space can inspire other senior citizens. Old folks have ambitions 
and dreams like everyone else. Why don't they work for them, go for 
it. Don't sit on the couch someplace. That's my attitude. As for Glenn, 
he won't be sitting on the couch for long. NasA still has days of 
medical tests planned as part of its experiments on him. But annie 
Glenn says the couple hopes to get a break for a getaway alone, this 
time by car -- with all four wheels on the ground. Robert Hager, NBC 
news, Houston.
