Scientists in California have a rare opportunity to learn more about 
dinosaurs. They've discovered a dinosaur egg containing an embryo. 
Denise Dillon reports they're using high technology to unlock its 
secrets. If you look closely, you may be able to see an image of the 
past. Here's the head, which is the skull and eye sockets. The neck 
area. Front claw. Front arm. Rib cage. Researchers in California used 
ct scanners and X-Rays to look deep inside these eggs. What they found 
was a first of its kind. Undisturbed remains of a dinosaur fetus. 
We were quite surprised and delighted and we were quite lucky to have 
ses mens because there are many that do not show any recognizable 
biological material inside. Researchers have named the fetus Nicole. 
The director of the paleoimaging project used a computerized 3d image 
to get a closer look. What they saw was a sight that has been impossible 
to see until now. Visually, when you cut open an egg, you don't see 
any of this. Maybe a little bit of fetal bone represented. And you 
see minerals that look almost similar to the minerals outside the 
egg. Which tells you to the inaided eye, it's nothing. Now it's life. 
now it's dna. Now it's bacteria. Now it's structure. The eggs came 
from a province in China where thousands of eggs like these have been 
discovered, so the researchers thought it was okay to risk examining 
them more closely. It was very exciting, the idea that we might actually 
image inside of them. It was certainly worth a try. We had nothing 
to lose, so to speak, except a little time. Time that paid off and 
helped turn back the hands of time to learn more about prehistoric 
life on earth. Denise Dillon, "Headline News."
