Two weeks after the Mike Piazza signing triggered what they expected 
to be a productive off season, the New York Mets announced Sunday 
that General Manager Steve Phillips was taking a leave of absence 
to deal with an allegation of sexual harassment as well as the repercussions 
of a series of extramarital affairs. During Phillips' leave, Frank 
Cashen, who was the team's general manager from 1980 through 1991 
and a mentor for Phillips, will serve as the interim general manager. 
Cashen takes over at a particularly difficult time of year for someone 
who has not been actively involved in baseball operations, when clubs 
begin to sign free agents and initiate talks with other teams about 
possible trades. Phillips, 35, was not present on the first day of 
the annual general managers meetings here. Instead, he issued a statement 
regarding a threatened lawsuit against him alleging that he sexually 
harassed a woman who formerly worked for the Mets at their St. Lucie, 
Fla., complex. Dave Howard, the Mets' senior vice president for business 
affairs, said that the Mets investigated the allegation and found 
that there was a consensual sexual relationship between Phillips and 
the woman, but no basis for the allegation of sexual harassment. ``After 
learning of the threatened allegation,'' Phillips, the father of two 
young sons, said in the statement, ``I have had numerous conversations 
with my wife and the ownership of the Mets about this and other consensual 
sexual relationships I have had during my marriage.'' Phillips said 
he had begun ``extensive personal counseling.'' Howard said the threat 
of a lawsuit ``brought to light some personal problems Steve has, 
and he's addressing them in counseling.'' Cashen, speaking at a news 
conference at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, said: ``I talked to Steve this 
morning, and he's going to put some things on paper and I'll talk 
to him about those. I'm going to try to expand and extend Steve's 
work rather than put my imprint on this club as being a Frank Cashen-type 
club.'' The severity of the situation was marked by the presence at 
the hotel earlier Sunday of the Mets' co-owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson 
Doubleday. They did not attend the news conference. In the past, the 
owners have abhorred the kind of behavior Phillips admitted to. Asked 
why Phillips was not being fired, in light of the owners' views, Howard 
said: ``The ownership's position is Steve's behavior, as he has admitted 
it, is inappropriate and from their standpoint is not acceptable. 
By the same token, Steve has been very forthcoming in admitting the 
problem and has immediately sought personal counseling to address 
the issue and to focus on preserving his family situation. ``Our view 
is this is an unfounded claim. While it does address personal issues 
and family issues, it is not disabling because of Steve's remorse 
and his immediate action to address the problem and get himself in 
position where he can come back as a full, functioning executive. 
Our view is Steve, like the rest of us, is human and makes mistakes. 
He's recognized that and has taken steps to address the problem.'' 
The allegation against Phillips, Howard said, was brought to the Mets' 
attention a week and a half ago by the lawyer for the woman, whom 
Howard declined to identify. ``We've investigated those allegations,'' 
said Howard, who also is the club's chief in-house counsel, ``and 
we are confident there is no basis to the allegations and there are 
no facts to support any claim for sexual harassment. Steve admits 
to having had a brief consensual relationship with this woman.'' The 
Mets, Howard added, have a ``very strong policy prohibiting sexual 
harassment.'' Although Phillips did not tell the Mets initially about 
the matter, the official said, ``Steve was very forthcoming to explain 
to us the facts of the relationship.'' At the same time, Howard said, 
Phillips informed the club's owners about the other relationships 
he had. In his statement, Phillips said his conversations with his 
wife and the Mets' owners were ``extremely painful,'' adding, ``I 
apologized for making some incredibly bad judgments, for the deep 
pain I have caused my family and for the embarrassment I have caused 
the Mets' organization.'' Howard said the club could not estimate 
how long Phillips' leave would last. ``It will be as long as Steve 
feels he needs to address his family and personal matters,'' Howard 
said. ``We're hopeful that it will be relatively short, but that remains 
to be seen.'' Howard said that even if a lawsuit was filed, he did 
not expect that it would have any effect on Phillips' return. Phillips 
began his baseball career as an infielder in the Mets' minor league 
system. In 1990 he became the team's administrative assistant for 
scouting and minor league operations, then became minor league director 
the next year. The club named him assistant general manager in September 
1995, and in July 1997 he was appointed general manager when Joe McIlvaine 
was fired. He is the third-youngest general manager in the major leagues; 
only Brian Cashman of the Yankees and Randy Smith of Detroit are younger. 
He and his wife, Marni, have two children, Brett, 3, and Ryan, who 
will be 6 next month. Cashen, 68, has been a vice president and consultant 
since he stepped down as general manager after the 1991 season. Becoming 
interim general manager, Cashen said, ``is not something I would have 
chose to do.'' He said the first he knew of what was happening occurred 
Saturday morning as he prepared to pay golf. ``I got a call from Fred 
Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday,'' Cashen said. ``They asked me if I would 
do an enormous favor for the organization. I said certainly, anything 
I can do I will do. Then they told me what the favor was and I was 
crestfallen about Steve. Once I got over that, I thought if I could 
do something to help him, it could help him with his recovery.'' Cashen 
said he expected to talk with Phillips about club matters twice a 
week.
