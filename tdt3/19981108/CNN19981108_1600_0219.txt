Sources tell CNN no hard and fast decisions will be taken by the Clinton 
administration on its response to Iraq. President Clinton met with 
his top national security advisers at camp david, including defense 
secretary William Cohen. He spent last week in the mideast, gauging 
support for a possible military strike against Iraq. Secretary of 
state Madeleine Albright and the head of the CIA were at the meeting. 
National security adviser Sandy Berger flew back from Paris for the 
meeting after talks with French and British leaders. One high placed 
source tells CNN the meeting is likely to start the clock ticking 
on a decision whether to launch cruise missile attacks on Saddam hussein. 
The Iraqi leader set off the latest crisis by ending his cooperation 
with u.N. weapons inspectors.
