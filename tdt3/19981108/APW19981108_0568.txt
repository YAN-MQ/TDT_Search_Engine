Qatar received on Sunday 20 British-made armored personnel carriers, 
half the number purchased under a 1996 arms deal. Qatar signed the 
deal with the London-based Alvis PLC for dlrs 22 million. A statement 
from Alvis said the first 20 Piranha APCs were delivered Sunday and 
the remaining 20 would be delivered in mid-1999. The deal for the 
APCs was part of a dlrs 830 million package negotiated with British 
arm-makers to also supply the oil-rich emirate with warplanes and 
fast patrol boats. The 1996 package was the first big contract for 
British arms-makers in the Gulf for years. Britain had lost out to 
the United States and France in weapons sales to the oil-rich region. 
Qatar has defense cooperation agreements with Britain, the United 
States and France.
