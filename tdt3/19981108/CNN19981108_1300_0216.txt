Sources tell CNN no "hard and fast decisions" will be taken by the 
Clinton administration on its response to Iraq. President Clinton 
is meeting with his top national security advisers at camp David. 
That includes defense secretary William Cohen. He spent last week 
in the mideast, gauging support for a possible military strike against 
Iraq. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright and the head of the CIA 
are also taking part. National security adviser Sandy Berger flew 
back from Paris for the meeting after talks with French and British 
leaders. One high-placed source tells CNN the meeting is likely to 
start the clock ticking on a decision whether to launch cruise missile 
attacks on Saddam hussein. The Iraqi leader set off the latest crisis 
by ending his cooperation with u.N. weapons inspectors.
