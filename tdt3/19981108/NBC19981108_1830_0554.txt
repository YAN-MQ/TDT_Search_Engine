Now to the political shake-out in Washington caused by the resignation 
of house speaker Newt Gingrich. NBC's Joe Johns is on Capitol Hill. 
I'm off to see my mother. House speaker Newt Gingrich stayed out of 
the limelight today, while the scramble to succeed him continues. 
Congressman Bob Livingston, the frontrunner, pledged to focus on legislation, 
not confrontation. What we want to do under my speakership, if my 
friends will elect me speaker, is not only articulate the message, 
but to provide the legislative machinery that it takes to back it 
up and put it through Congress and write it into law. Livingston, 
powerful chairman of the house appropriations committee, has his critics. 
Weeks ago when democrats got billions in the budget for education 
and other programs, conservatives blasted Livingston and Gingrich 
for caving in to avoid shutting down the government. Livingston's 
competition for speaker republican policy chairman Chris Cox said 
such year-end chaos should stop. That's no way to run a $1.8 trillion 
operation. Still, Livingston's allies are confident. They say he already 
has support of about half of the republicans in the house. We'll have 
more than enough votes, and we are cautiously optimistic. It's moving 
very well in Bob's direction. But that could change before the actual 
vote a week from wednesday. Congressman J.C. Watts, who himself is 
running for a leadership post, said house members should take their 
time deciding on a speaker. Let's get back to Washington on November 
18th, let's listen to the options that we have, let's make a decision. 
The field is wide open for top jobs other than speaker. Congresswoman 
Jennifer Dunn of Washington state, who is considering a run for majority 
leader, the number-two job. It's possible that I will take a look 
at that in the next couple of days. While the leadership races develop, 
the focus turns back on speaker Gingrich tomorrow, when he is expected 
to give a speech to the party faithful, detailing the political situation 
as he sees it for the next two years. Joe Johns, NBC news, the capitol.
