I'm Anthony Keith James, and this is "CNN Headline Sports." First 
up, the NFL, and week ten. The falcons are on the road in New England. 
The jaguars looking to go to 7-2 with a win over the bengals. The 
Eagles hosting the lions. The dolphins up against the Colts in an 
AFC east battle. The saints on the road with the Vikings. The Cowboys 
at home with the giants. The Ravens and raiders. The Rams and bears 
in a battle of two teams going nowhere. Coming up later, a battle 
of heisman trophy winners, with the bills, led by doug Flutie, matching 
up with Vinny Testaverde and the jets. The bills have won five straight 
games and are 3-0 under Flutie. The jets have won three in a row and 
are 5-0 with Testaverde at the helm. Something will have to give when 
the surging teams meet for at least a Share of first place in the 
AFC east. They are a good team. But, I've always been one to say if 
we do the things that we're supposed to do, then it doesn't really 
matter what they do. With the talent that we have in the locker room, 
we can beat anybody in the league and we've proven that already. We 
can also lose to anybody in the league, so we just have to go out 
and keep playing hard and concentrate and let the chips fall where 
they may. Also, the 49ers run with the Panthers. The status of quarterback 
Steve young is still questionable for today's game. He is suffering 
from a strained abdominal muscle.
