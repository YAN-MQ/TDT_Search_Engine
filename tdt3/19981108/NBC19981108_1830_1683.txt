That's "NBC nightly news" for this Sunday. Here's stone Phillips with 
a preview of tonight's edition of "dateline nbc." Thanks, dawn. Coming 
up tonight on "Dateline" -- a band of explorers who risk their lives 
inside a place most of us never even knew existed -- a vast cave system 
beneath tons of ice, so unstable one wrong move could leave you lost 
forever. It's one of the wrors deaths I could possibly imagine, being 
lost in a Cave, still alive, just waiting for your air to run out 
and then you drown, in the dark on our own. Would they survive their 
perilous dive into a cave of ice? That story on "dateline Sunday," 
tonight at 8:00, 7:00 central. Thanks, stone. Tom Brokaw reports from 
Washington tomorrow. I'm dawn fratangelo in New York. Good night, 
everyone.
