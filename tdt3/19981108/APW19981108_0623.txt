John Hunt, leader of the British expedition which first climbed Mount 
Everest, has died at age 88. Hunt died at his home in Henley-on-Thames 
Saturday night, said his daughter, Sally Nesbitt. The family's announcement 
on Sunday said only that Hunt died following a brief illness. As leader 
of the expedition in 1953, Hunt decided it was his responsibility 
to remain at base camp while Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed 
the last 400 feet (120 m) to the summit. Hunt recalled that he wept 
for joy when the two men reached the top on May 29, calling it the 
greatest moment of his life, but it was tinged with personal disappointment. 
``It was my ambition just as much as everybody else's in the party 
to be first at the top,'' he said in an interview with the Evening 
News in 1978. ``I thought about it a lot and concluded that it was 
important for the leader to be in a position where he could exercise 
some control if necessary. It did not seem that I could do both.'' 
In fact, Hunt and two other members of the team made the first attempt 
on the south col, but stopped 400 feet (120 m) short of the sumit. 
They left their equipment and supplies for Hillary and Tenzing to 
make the second attempt. Had they failed, Hunt said he was prepared 
to lead a third assault on the peak. Hunt was a colonel in the British 
Army when he was tapped to lead the Everest expedition. He later felt 
that his mountain-climing fame thwarted his ambitions of reaching 
the highest ranks of the army, and he retired in 1956 to become the 
first director of the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme promoted by Prince 
Philip. He was knighted in 1953 and elevated in 1966 to the House 
of Lords, where he took the titlle of Baron Hunt of Llanfairwaterdine. 
He was a personal adviser to Prime Minister Harold Wilson during the 
Nigerian civil war in the late 1960s and directed British relief missions 
to that country. Hunt is survived by his wife Joy, whom he married 
in 1936, and their four daughters. Funeral arrangements were not announced.
