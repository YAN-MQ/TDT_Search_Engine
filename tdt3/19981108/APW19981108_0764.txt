Guyanese health officials are immunizing people against yellow fever 
after reports of the disease along the country's border with Brazil 
and Venezuela. The Guyanese health ministry said Sunday it is working 
with the Pan American Health Organization to immunize children and 
the elderly, who are especially susceptible to the mosquito-borne 
disease. Officials said they are particularly worried about miners, 
loggers and other workers who spend most of their time in Guyana's 
thick tropical forests. It was not clear how many people have contracted 
the disease.
