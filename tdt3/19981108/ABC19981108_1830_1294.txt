Hollywood's big W action vie is about Arab terrorists, but there is 
a lot of tion outside the eaters. Protesters in a half dozen U.S. 
cities were saying "the siege"ncourages stereotypes. C's Jami Floyd 
has the story. Arab-Americans are waging a campaign against "the ege." 
In the thriller, Islamic terrorists wreak havoc in new RK, provoking 
a Roundup of Arab-American American Arabs and Muslims say the film 
feeds stereotypes long fueled by hollood. It creates the equation 
that Arab equals Muslim andhat Muslim equals terrorist. The film's 
director says the intention was different. I was trying to actually 
examine some of our own prejudices. And the movie is deeply -- it's 
anti-fanaticism, a it's anti-prejudice. But others remain unconvinced. 
Across the country, Arab-Americans are leafletting in front of theaters 
showing "the siege." They say it is not a protest, but instead, an 
opportunity to offer basic information out Muslim culture and religion. 
Critics say the Moe's stance against mistreating Arabs does not make 
ufor the Negative images. A film like "the siege" H devastating consequences 
for Arabs who live here in the U.S. because they are perceived netively 
in T streets. And it is an image not unfamiliar on the big screen. 
Films like "true lies" and "executive decision" were also criticized 
for theinegative portrayal of ara, a charge that zwick denies applies 
to his film. I think there is a tradition of Hollywood movies having 
been, I think, stereotypical in their portray of Arab-Americans. This 
just doesn't happen to be one. Both sidehope the film will spark a 
constructive dialogue. But for now, "the ege" remains under siege.
