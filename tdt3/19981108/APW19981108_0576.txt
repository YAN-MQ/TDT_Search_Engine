Nationwide elections Sunday are for governors and congressmen, but 
Venezuelans were also deciding the political fortunes of a failed 
coup leader running for president on an anti-corruption, anti-establishment 
platform. Supported by millions of peasants and shantytown dwellers, 
a new movement led by Hugo Chavez, who took up arms against the government 
six years ago, appears poised for a strong showing in Sunday's congressional 
vote. With Venezuelan politics taking on overtones of class warfare, 
officials fear an outbreak of violence. They dispatched about 100,000 
soldiers and policemen to ensure peaceful voting, expelled the local 
election board in the country's second most populous state, and prohibited 
the sale of liquor and the carrying of weapons. President Rafael Caldera, 
whose army chief recently implied the armed forces would seek to block 
Chavez's rise to power, cast his ballot and declared the vote ``an 
expression of the will of the people.'' In a country where fraud allegations 
often surround elections, Caldera promised the results would be ``respected 
completely and in a transparent, clean and honest way.'' About 11 
million of Venezuela's 23 million inhabitants are eligible to vote, 
and by midday Sunday, turnout looked strong. However, the voting was 
plagued by long lines and confusion over complicated ballots. Voting 
machines that were being used for the first time in Venezuela were 
malfunctioning in many balloting stations.
