Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play. Having 
won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected easily to 
advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup. But the match in Salerno, 
near Naples, was suspended after a Belgian off-field official was 
injured by the explosion of a device hurled from the stands at the 
interval. Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield 
helping the referee and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a right 
knee injury. UEFA said that Fiorentina was responsible for security 
both inside and outside the stadium, even though it was not its home 
ground. The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was 
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi stadium 
as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup game. However, 
UEFA conceded that the explosive device was aimed at the Fiorentina 
team and not at the Swiss club or match officials. Otherwise, it said, 
it would have dealt a stiffer fine. Fiorentina and Salerno fans have 
a history of rivalry. But the club wanted to raise funds for victims 
of recent flooding in southern Italy and so played at the grounds 
of its rival. Italian papers reported that police questioned a local 
Salerno man who was a suspect.
