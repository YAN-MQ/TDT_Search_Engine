The strained ties between Malaysia and Singapore can return to normal 
following last week's meeting between their prime ministers, Malaysian 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi was quoted as saying Sunday. Abdullah 
said the two leaders, who met Thursday at Kuala Lumpur's international 
airport, reached an understanding on several issues that had caused 
tensions between the two neighbors. ``The meeting will pave the way 
for improved bilateral relations,'' the national news agency Bernama 
quoted Abdullah as telling reporters in Johore Baharu, 360 kilometers 
(216 miles) south of the capital. After Thursday's meeting, Malaysian 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he and Singapore Prime Minister 
Goh Chok Tong agreed that their officials would curb the heated attacks 
on each other. Singapore also agreed to cooperate in finding ways 
to raise funds for Malaysia, while Malaysia promised to help meet 
Singapore's water requirements, one of the issues that had caused 
tensions. Singapore now obtains most of its water from Malaysia. More 
recent problems in relations included arguments over the location 
of a border post and the cancellation of automatic flyover rights 
for Singaporean military aircraft using Malaysian airspace. Thursday's 
was the first top-level meeting between the two countries since relations, 
testy even before the added pressure of the Asian financial crisis, 
started to deteriorate rapidly earlier this year. The two leaders 
last had met in April. Bernama said Abdullah also referred to a call 
by Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado for a stronger U.S. 
presence in his country due to the conflicting claims between China 
and the Philippines over areas in the Spratly Islands in the South 
China Sea. Abdullah said the United States and the Philippines had 
close ties, but cooperation between members of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations was crucial for the security and stability 
of the region. The ASEAN members are Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Brunei, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia and Vietnam. Abdullah said 
ASEAN countries had reached an understanding not to resort to any 
action that could create tension in the region, such as the use of 
military force to settle the overlapping claims for the Spratlys. 
``Instead, ASEAN preferred to resolve issues among themselves through 
peaceful negotiations,'' he said.
