One snowboarder is dead and another seriously injured following an 
avalanche in a closed ski resort in Utah. Deputies say five snowboarders 
were heading down Mt. baldy at the snowbird ski resort yesterday. 
One kicked some snow loose and triggered an avalanche, which carried 
the party down 500 feet of rocks and cliffs. One man was buried beneath 
two feet of snow. No avalanche control work had been done on the slope 
because the resort was not open at the time of the accident.
