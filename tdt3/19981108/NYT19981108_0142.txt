The front-runner to be the next speaker of the House said on Sunday 
that lawmakers should consider public sentiment that President Clinton 
has not committed impeachable offenses, even as a House panel prepared 
to begin impeachment hearings on Monday. Rep. Robert Livingston of 
Louisiana, the leading candidate to replace Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
said he would wait for the recommendations of the House Judiciary 
Committee and its chairman, Henry Hyde of Illinois, before passing 
judgment. But Livingston also said public opinion needs to be factored 
into the final decision. ``The American people have certainly indicated 
in the polls that they don't see it as an impeachable or dismissible 
offense, and that would have to be considered in the political arena,'' 
Livingston said on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.'' ``But 
still in all, we cannot simply disregard the fact that there are other 
people in our society, in the military and in various other walks 
of life, as CEO's or principals of schools, who have been likewise 
charged and have lost their jobs,'' Livingston said. When asked if 
last Tuesday's elections, which brought Democrats surprising victories, 
were a referendum on impeachment that cleared Clinton, Livingston 
hedged his bets. ``Well, I don't know if he's home free or not,'' 
he said. ``But I would have to say that the president has still to 
answer to the American people for the charges, and the charges are 
that he lied, and that he lied under oath.'' Livingston's comments 
took on particular relevance as the House moved to select its new 
leaders, because if the Judiciary Committee approves articles of impeachment 
against Clinton, the speaker will oversee the debate on the House 
floor. But Democrats and a growing number of Republicans say the likelihood 
of this lame-duck House impeaching Clinton is diminishing by the day. 
And impeachment in the next Congress would be even more problematic, 
with the Republicans' majority pared to just six seats. On Monday, 
a Judiciary subcommittee will hear from 19 historians, constitutional 
scholars and former Justice Department officials on what constitutes 
an impeachable offense. The independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, whose 
scathing 445-page report ignited the impeachment inquiry, is scheduled 
to testify on Nov. 19, the same day House Republicans are likely to 
vote by secret ballot to pick their choice for speaker. As the Judiciary 
Committee moves to center stage, an influential Republican on the 
panel, Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, seemed to hint on Sunday 
that he believed lying alone might not be an impeachable offense. 
``If it's a high crime or misdemeanor, given the context of what occurred, 
there's a sense of proportionality that has to come to bear,'' Graham 
said on ``Meet the Press.'' ``Every felony doesn't allow you to get 
the death penalty,'' he said. ``Every high crime and misdemeanor may 
not result in impeachment or should result in impeachment. You have 
to have a sense of proportionality, but you've got to stand up for 
the rule of law. '' On the CBS News program ``Face the Nation,'' Graham 
said he was prepared to vote for an article of impeachment on the 
grounds of perjury. But he seemed to suggest that a possible alternative 
punishment might be in order. Graham's views are important because 
he is one of a group of 10 moderate Republicans and Democrats who 
are open to some sort of alternative punishment, including censure. 
``If this is just about sex with an intern, and being caught off guard, 
and making false statements, but not really having a criminal heart 
about it, then that's one thing,'' he said. ``But if it's really about 
grand jury perjury, then we've got to say, given the context of that 
situation, is the political death penalty warranted? The political 
death penalty is impeachment.'' A senior Democrat on the Judiciary 
Committee, Rep. Charles Schumer of New York, who was elected to the 
Senate last Tuesday, said censure would be an appropriate penalty. 
``I don't think the president should go away without any punishment,'' 
Schumer said on ``Meet the Press.'' Schumer predicted that neither 
the Judiciary Committee nor the full House would vote to impeach Clinton. 
``They're going to figure out a way to wriggle out of this,''he said.
