As U.S. officials studied a possible military strike against Iraq, 
Iraqi ministers said Sunday they were not afraid of American attacks 
and would not back down on barring U.N. arms inspections. Trade Minister 
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters that Iraq is not cowed by U.S. 
threats. ``We are not fearing from any military strike ... and our 
country is prepared to face any military aggression,'' he said. ``They 
will not kill in a military strike more than they are killing with 
sanctions every day,'' Saleh said, referring to U.N. Security Council 
trade sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz also told the official Iraqi News 
Agency that the government was not moved by a U.N. Security Council 
resolution last week holding it in ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. 
edicts. ``Iraq adheres to its stance until the Security Council fulfills 
its obligation toward Iraq,'' INA quoted Aziz as saying. This, he 
said, involved lifting the U.N. ban on oil sales ``as a start toward 
the final lifting of the whole embargo.'' Aziz _ the most senior Iraqi 
official to react to the latest U.N. resolution _ spoke after meeting 
a delegation of Irish and Scottish politicians who said they opposed 
the use of force against Iraq. ``I think nothing is solved by military 
action,'' said Tam Dalyell, a Scottish member of the British Parliament 
who accompanied Reynolds. ``It just creates a bitterness between old 
friends that I deplore.'' Dalyell said the delegation's leader, former 
Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, planned to brief U.S. President 
Bill Clinton about his findings in Baghdad, adding: ``I hope it does 
some good.'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash 
Shah, also met Sunday with Aziz. Shah refused to give details of the 
session to reporters. The United, 9th graf pvs
