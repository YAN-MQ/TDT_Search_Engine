To ease customers into the new postal rates that take effect Jan. 
10, the U.S. Postal Service will start Monday to flood the country 
with its new H for Hat stamp _ 14,692,520,000 of them. The stamps, 
which were printed during the last several years before the new basic 
33-cent rate was approved, picture Uncle Sam's hat and the words ``USA 
H First-Class Rate,'' but do not show any value, although they will 
cost 33 cents. They are part of a series printed in advance for other 
rate increases, with A, B, C and D picturing only letters, followed 
by E for Earth, F for Flower and G for Old Glory. The last rate increase, 
to 32 cents from 29, took place on Jan. 1, 1995. The Postal Service 
is also releasing a nondenominated stamp on Tuesday, which is worth 
1 cent and pictures a rooster weather vane, to use with any 32-cent 
stamps that customers have left over on Jan. 10. Not all postal rates 
will rise in January. The cost of additional ounces for heavier letters 
will fall 1 cent, to 22 cents, so the cost of a 2-ounce letter will 
remain 55 cents and the cost of a 3-ounce letter drops to 77 cents, 
from 78. That means new 22-cent and 77-cent stamps, picturing Uncle 
Sam and Mary Breckinridge, respectively. Breckinridge was the founder 
of the Frontier Nursing Service in Kentucky. The basic Priority Mail 
rate rises to $3.20 from $3 (with another stamp to be issued Tuesday, 
showing a space-shuttle landing), and Express Mail goes to $11.75 
from $10.75 (with still another stamp, showing a shuttle piggybacked 
on a transporter plane, but not until Nov. 19).
