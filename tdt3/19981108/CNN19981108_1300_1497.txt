The imax film system was first introduced at the 1967 expo in Montreal, 
canada. Now, a small group of filmmakers has come up with the idea 
that's making it big worldwide. Dennis Michael reports. This is a 
really nice way to film and make a living! Sometimes making a hit 
movie doesn't look like making a hit movie. The imax film "Everest" 
is unquestionably a high point for the special venue filmmaker, a 
hit that is changing everything for imax. "Everest" spent several 
weeks at number one on the exclusive exhibition charts and is still 
in the top 20 in the overall box office stats, a Blockbuster for imax. 
Producer Greg MacGillivray spent $2 million to promote the special 
event film the way the big studios do, and saw increases in the box 
from 20% to 45% at every theater. What this proved to us is that there 
is a vast audience out there that actually wants this experience on 
this giant screen. They just haven't been hearing about it in the 
past. These are big times for a company that has made bigness a way 
of life. The imax film "frame," shown here compared with 16mm, 35mm 
and 70mm film stock, is ten times bigger than the ordinary movie. 
It's projected on a screen that is nine stories tall from a projector 
the size of a compact car. The result is a startlingly clear, stable 
and, let's face it, big image. There are now nearly 180 imax theaters 
around the world, including many that are equipped for imax 3d. Brett 
Leonard made "T-Rex: return to the cretaceous" in the format. Jean-Jacques 
annaud directed "wings of courage" in imax 3d. The rolling stones 
have been made even larger than life by imax. And the magical masters 
of Las Vegas are next. We feel that this imax 3d is just the right 
vehicle for siegfried and Roy because there is fantasy, but it gets 
into reality. But the biggest star on the biggest screen is imax itself. 
And that's where bigness can be harnessed. Imax is also a brand, so 
we don't have to pay the same kind of talent that hollywood has to 
pay, which is really a huge percentage of the costs. Once you take 
those costs down and you look at just making the film with the world 
around you as the talent, you get into much more manageable budget 
ranges. A typical 2d film at imax is about $5 million. A typical 3d 
film at imax is about $10 million. And the mainstream exhibition industry 
is making room -- a lot of room -- for a really big screen. Dennis 
Michael, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
