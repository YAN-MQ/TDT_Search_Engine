The famous twin towers of Wembley Stadium are going to be demolished 
in a redevelopment plan. Work begins next year on rebuilding the historic 
stadium. Original plans called for saving the towers, but architects 
have concluded the towers cannot be conserved, The Sunday Telegraph 
reported. ``That was certainly the original wish when this project 
was being contemplated because they are a landmark of Wembley,'' said 
Graham Kelly, chief executive of the English Football Association. 
``In any project of this size, there are changes along the way.'' 
``I don't know whether it would be possible to keep the Twin Towers 
or not,'' he added. The newspaper said English Heritage _ the agency 
protecting national monuments _ had been informed that the towers 
will not fit in with the futuristic design of the new stadium. Architects 
also point out that the new stadium will be located north of its present 
site, which would leave the towers in the center of the pitch. The 
new stadium is a key to England's bid to land the 2006 World Cup, 
with South Africa and Germany among the other leading contenders.
