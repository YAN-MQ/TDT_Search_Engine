Wendell Chino, the longtime president of the Mescalero Apache Nation 
who helped to lift his tribe from tar-paper-shack poverty with his 
persuasive style of ``red capitalism,'' died on Wednesday at the Santa 
Monica-UCLA Medical Center in California. He was 74. Chino had suffered 
from a heart ailment and collapsed while walking on a treadmill at 
a health clinic in Santa Monica, said Catherine Bedell, a spokeswoman 
for the Mescalero Apache tribe of New Mexico. Chino was revived but 
later died of a second heart attack, she said. After more than a century 
of federal policies that ranged from extermination to assimilation, 
Indian nations began in the 1960s to gain a greater degree of self-determination. 
The movement began in earnest with men like Chino, the president of 
his tribe for 34 years, who demanded that the federal government honor 
the treaties it made with Indian nations regarding the use of the 
land and its resources. ``He took stances that affected Indians not 
only on his reservation, but all over the country,'' said Roy Bernal, 
chairman of the All Indian Pueblo Council and a member of the Taos 
Pueblo nation. ``In the scheme of the 20th century, it has been said 
that Wendell Chino was a Martin Luther King or a Malcolm X of Indian 
Country,'' Bernal said. ``He was truly a modern warrior.'' Until the 
mid-'60s, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs had significant control 
over the Mescalero reservation, 200 miles south of Albuquerque, N.M. 
The agency oversaw everything from mining to lumber to grazing contracts 
on the reservation, which is home to 4,000 people. As those contracts 
expired, Chino did not renew them, instead creating lumber and cattle 
companies controlled by the impoverished tribe. With Chino's guidance, 
the Mescalero Apache Nation built a ski resort, the Inn of the Mountain 
Gods, Casino Apache, a timber mill and a metal fabrication plant, 
as well as Indian schools, a hospital and a health center. In 1977, 
during a court battle in which Chino was attempting to secure sole 
control of Mescalero Apache natural resources, he described the problem: 
``The white man has raped this land and now he wastes the 6 million 
acres of Indian land in this state.'' Chino believed Indian people 
should make decisions about Indian land, a notion he described as 
``red capitalism.'' Chino's positions could also be unpopular: He 
split with New Mexico Indian leaders last year, refusing to honor 
a gambling-revenue-sharing agreement with the state. ``He did not 
recognize the state as a legitimate entity,'' Bernal said. ``He would 
only deal with the federal government, nation to nation.'' Chino also 
created a split within the Mescalero community when he invited nuclear 
power companies to bury their radioactive waste on tribal land in 
the early 1990s. The tribe rejected the proposal. ``His friends were 
few,'' said James Toulouse, an Albuquerque lawyer who considers himself 
part of that small circle. ``But folks listened to what he had to 
say.'' Even presidents did not escape Chino's wrath. He once lambasted 
President Jimmy Carter in 1978 for what Chino called the president's 
lack of attention to the economic and political problems of the American 
Indian. ``If Jimmy Carter has time enough to worry about human rights 
in Latin America and poverty in Africa, he should find some time to 
visit American Indians,'' Chino said. Chino, described at times as 
a benevolent dictator, held tightly to the reins of Mescalero affairs 
while he traveled the world as a spokesman for Indian issues and served 
as the president of the National Congress of American Indians. Born 
on Dec. 25, 1923, on the reservation, Chino was educated in the Santa 
Fe Indian School System. He attended Central College in Pella, Iowa, 
and the Cook Christian Training School in Phoenix. He was an ordained 
minister in the Dutch Reformed Church and a graduate of Western Theological 
Seminary in Holland, Mich. He is survived by his wife, Rita, and son, 
Mark, both of Mescalero.
