The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 9: Tuesday's 
election results cheered not only Democrats but conservationists as 
well. Montana voters banned the use of cyanide leaching at open-pit 
gold mines, a technique lethal to rivers and streams. Colorado and 
South Dakota imposed tough new restrictions on giant hog farms, which 
can generate as much pollution as a small city. New Jersey's approval 
of a $1 billion plan to save vanishing farmland was one of many successful 
state and local initiatives aimed at protecting open space from commercial 
development. Nearly three-fourths of all environmental ballot proposals 
passed muster. That sends a message to Washington. Americans would 
clearly like to see a more vigorous brand of environmental stewardship 
in the new Congress, and will support the administration as it grapples 
with unresolved and politically difficult environmental issues. Montana's 
decision to clamp down on dirty mine operations _ a remarkable gesture 
in a state long sympathetic to extractive industries _ ought to encourage 
the Interior Department to try again to tighten mining laws. The votes 
against hog farms should encourage the Environmental Protection Agency 
to push ahead with tougher clean water regulations for big agricultural 
operations. The broadest message involved open space, an issue on 
which Vice President Al Gore has been increasingly vocal. An estimated 
400,000 acres a year are being bulldozed for subdivisions, shopping 
malls and roads, and when voters in places like New York's Suffolk 
County approve a $62 million bond issue to buy open space, it is clear 
that they have just about had enough. With that in mind, the administration 
should make a vigorous push for full financing of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, the one federal program explicitly designed to 
help states and communities preserve open space. About $900 million 
flows into the fund every year from offshore oil royalties, but in 
the last few years Congress has usually appropriated only one-third 
of that amount for land purchases. Congress and the administration 
have also tended to favor federal conservation projects over local 
projects, even though the original statute setting up the fund mandated 
a 50-50 split. Perhaps this year Washington will open its ears to 
what the grass roots are saying.
