Defense Secretary George Robertson left Sunday for Kuwait to inspect 
British warplanes on standby for possible strikes against Iraq. ``People 
know what they are up against. They know where they stand,'' Robertson 
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview before leaving. 
Robertson will also consult with government leaders in Kuwait and 
Bahrain over the willingness to use force. Britain dispatched 12 Tornado 
fighter-bombers to Kuwait in February as part of a military buildup 
after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein blocked U.N. weapons inspections. 
Robertson said Saturday that although Saddam is again defying the 
United Nations the time for military action had not yet come.
