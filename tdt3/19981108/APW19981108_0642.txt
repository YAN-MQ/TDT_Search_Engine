Italian league leader Fiorentina was kicked out of this season's European 
club competition Sunday in punishment for the explosion that injured 
a match official and caused the suspension of a UEFA Cup game last 
week. Fiorentina immediately announced it would appeal. If that fails, 
it will be Grasshoppers of Zurich that advances to the third round 
of the UEFA Cup against France's Bordeaux. ``Fiorentina was responsible 
for order and security both inside and around the stadium, before 
during and after the match and therefore liable for incidents of any 
kind,'' said UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Commission. ``Had there 
not been mitigating circumstances, Fiorentina AC would have been excluded 
from future UEFA club competitions as well,'' it said. Specifically 
it cited the fact that it was apparently a supporter of Fiorentina's 
Italian rival, Salerna, who threw the device. The match was held at 
Salerna, near Naples in southern Italy. Fiorentina was leading 2-1 
after the first 45 minutes of play. Having won the first leg against 
the Swiss side 2-0, it expected easily to advance to the third round 
of the UEFA Cup. But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field 
official was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval. 
Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield helping 
the referee and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a right knee 
injury. Several players were temporarily deafened. The game was being 
played in Salerno because Fiorentina was paying the second and last 
round of suspension of its Franchi stadium as a result fan violence 
during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup game. UEFA said Fiorentina's previous 
bad record had been taken into account on deciding on the expulsion. 
Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of bitterness. But Fiorentina 
club wanted to raise funds for victims of recent flooding in southern 
Italy and so played at the grounds of its rival. Italian papers reported 
that police questioned a local Salerno man who was a suspect. Luciano 
Luna, the administrator of Fiorentina, said his club would appeal 
by the Wednesday midnight deadline. The appeal is likely to be heard 
next weekend. ``The bomb was aimed at Fiorentina, not against the 
referees and not against the Grasshoppers players,'' he said. Luna 
was called into the disciplinary commission's meeting at a Geneva 
airport hotel to be told of the decision after the three hour session. 
``We welcome the decision of UEFA and think it's a sensible decision 
given the circumstances,'' said Grasshoppers' president Romano Spadaro. 
``We are looking forward to playing against Bordeaux,'' he said. The 
third round takes place Nov. 24 and Dec. 8. The UEFA Cup is the least 
lucrative of the three European club tournaments. But even so, it 
is still an important money-spinner for the clubs. At least Fiorentina 
is still on course for a place in next season's European Cup. It recovered 
its place at the top of the Italian league Sunday with a 4-1 win over 
last-place Venezia. Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games 
to fall from the top spot.
