Israel's defense minister says he expects the Israeli cabinet to ratify 
the U.S.-brokered wye river accord this week. Debate on the agreement 
in the Israel cabinet was suspended Friday after a Bombing attack 
in Jerusalem. The land-for-security deal calls for Israel to turn 
over another 13% of the West Bank to the Palestinians. Prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will continue construction on a planned 
Jewish community in predominately Arab east Jerusalem. Groundbreaking 
at the site lead to a breakdown in mideast peace talks last year.
