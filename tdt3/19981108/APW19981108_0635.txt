Congolese rebels on Sunday challenged President Laurent Kabila to 
negotiate an end to their three-month war, or face a military defeat. 
Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, said Rwanda's acknowledgment Friday 
that it is supporting the rebels had removed the last obstacle to 
direct negotiations with the government on how to end fighting and 
resolve political disputes. African and U.S. negotiators are hoping 
Rwanda's statement will lead the eight foreign powers involved in 
the war to agree to a cease-fire and a withdrawal of forces from Congo. 
So far, both the government in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa and 
its main ally, Zimbabwe, have reacted coolly to the prospect of talks 
with the rebels, who have been fighting since Aug. 2. Congo is demanding 
an unconditional withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops before any 
deal can be reached. ``We are challenging Kabila to negotiate, now 
that Rwanda has made its presence in Congo clear and removed that 
last obstacle to peace talks,'' Karaha told The Associated Press from 
the eastern rebel stronghold of Goma. ``Kabila will have to negotiate 
sooner or later. If he keeps refusing, then we shall make it public 
to the Congolese people that he is the obstacle and has to go.'' The 
rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, opposition politicians and 
disenchanted Congolese soldiers _ accuse Kabila of mismanagement, 
corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400 tribes. Karaha said 
Rwanda's involvement was legitimate because of concerns that former 
Hutu soldiers and militiamen who fled Rwanda in fear of reprisals 
for a 1994 genocide were using eastern Congo to launch attacks against 
that country. Meanwhile, rebel forces on Saturday captured Aketi, 
800 kilometers (500 miles) northwest of Goma, Karaha said. Since they 
were defeated outside Kinshasa in August by Kabila's allies from Angola, 
Zimbabwe and Namibia, the rebels have made steady gains from their 
eastern strongholds in northern Congo and the southern, mineral-rich 
provinces of Katanga and Eastern Kasai. Karaha said his troops had 
killed more than 100 Chadian soldiers and took prisoner 200 others 
in fighting for Aketi. Chad has sent 2,000 troops to prop up Kabila.
