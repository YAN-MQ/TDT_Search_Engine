Thongchai Jaidee and Rangsan Ruengtham both shot even-par 72s Sunday 
as Thailand wrapped up a 15-stroke victory in the Putra Cup, its sixth 
triumph in 13 years in the amateur teams tournament. Thailand finished 
the four-day tournament with a total of 876. The Philippines, hurt 
by a bad start, finished second at 891, with Singapore third at 902. 
``Our players came here to play their final tune-up before the Asian 
Games,'' Thai team manager Methee Sudasna said, referring to the regional 
games next month in Bangkok. Thongchai celebrated his 29th birthday 
Sunday by taking top individual honors with an even-par 288. ``I feel 
great. Winning the individual title is very memorable for me,'' the 
Thai army soldier said through an interpreter. Rangsan, a 26-year-old 
soldier, placed second in individual scoring with 292. Gerald Rosales 
led the Philippine team with a total of 296, good for fifth among 
individuals. Malaysia placed fourth with 908, followed by Indonesia 
with 910, Hong Kong with 923, Papua New Guinea with 967 and Brunei 
with 1,012. The 72-hole tournament followed the four-to-play, three-to-count 
format. It was played at the Santa Elena Golf Club in Santa Rosa in 
Laguna province, south of Manila.
