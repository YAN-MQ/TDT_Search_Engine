John Glenn, the world's oldest space traveler, said Sunday that he 
slept ``like a log'' his first night back on Earth after a nine-day 
shuttle mission. At the Discovery crew's first news conference after 
their return, Glenn admitted that he ``didn't feel too hot'' when 
he emerged from the shuttle upon landing on Saturday. Glenn, 77, who 
in 1962 became the first American to orbit Earth, said he struggled 
against gravity. ``I was walking straddle-legged to keep my balance 
a little bit,'' he said. ``I'm probably 95 or 98 percent back to normal 
now.'' NASA doctors said none of the astronauts showed significant 
medical problems after a journey of 3.6 million miles and 134 orbits 
around the earth. Stephen Robinson, 43, a mission specialist, said 
he gashed his head traveling through a tunnel inside the shuttle ``going 
kind of fast,'' but that he did not lack for doctors on board. ``They 
just jumped with delight,'' he said. Glenn steered questions to his 
crewmates: Lt. Col. Curtis Brown Jr., 42, the shuttle's commander; 
Lt. Col. Steven Lindsey, 38, the pilot; Scott Parazynski, 37, a mission 
specialist and the senator's attending doctor in space; 35-year-old 
Pedro Duque, another mission specialist and the first Spaniard to 
go into space; and Chiaki Mukai, 46, the payload specialist. ``They're 
the heroes of this thing as far as I am concerned,'' Glenn said. Some 
other members of the Discovery crew said they were grateful for the 
interest Glenn brought to the space program. ``The attention is wonderful 
and I hope it does last,'' said Parazynski, whom Glenn called ``Count 
Dracula'' because he was always drawing blood from him. The crew and 
their families flew to Houston Sunday after the press conference for 
a welcoming ceremony and 17 more days of testing at the Johnson Space 
Center. Glenn, who is the subject of geriatric research, faces more 
blood tests and urine collection, as well as cardiovascular, bone 
loss and sleep studies. He will not be allowed to drink alcohol or 
caffeine and his sleep, exercise and food consumption will be monitored. 
At the press conference, Glenn said the space trip left him with both 
a sense of accomplishment and ``a little letdown that the whole thing 
is over.'' He said this would be his last attempt at space flight 
in deference to Annie, his wife of 55 years. ``She's been through 
enough,'' he said. ``I owe her some consideration at this point in 
life.'' Glenn, a Democratic senator from Ohio who will retire in January 
after 24 years, is expected to return to his home in the Washington 
area around Thanksgiving, but he is scheduled to undergo sporadic 
testing for the next six months. Sunday he said he had not discussed 
``follow-up relationships or anything like that'' with NASA, but wanted 
to help promote the benefits of the space program. He said he also 
planned to work with students at Ohio State University and his alma 
mater, Muskingum College in Ohio, to address the ``cynical and apathetic 
attitude'' he sees in the country. Asked to compare his Discovery 
flight with his first trip into space, he said: ``The first flight 
was the first orbital flight we ever tried. We were just trying to 
find out if we could do it or not. ``Now, we had 83 different research 
projects on this one flight, things of tremendous value,'' he said. 
``They're out there on the cutting edge of science.'' He did note 
the difference in the shuttle itself, which was far more spacious 
than the tiny cockpit he occupied on his first flight. In a playful 
jab at a crewmate's reaction to weightlessness, Glenn said, ``Chiaki 
had the roundest face I'd ever seen.'' Dr. Mukai laughed at the comment 
and had only praise for her fellow astronaut. ``I was so amazed and 
impressed by Sen. Glenn,'' she said. ``He encourages me quite a lot.'' 
Asked by an 83-year-old reporter if there was hope ``for people of 
my generation,'' Glenn said: ``There's a lot of hope. You should run 
your life not by the calendar but how you feel, and what you're interests 
are and ambitions. Old folks have dreams and ambitions too, like everybody 
else. Don't sit on a couch someplace.''
