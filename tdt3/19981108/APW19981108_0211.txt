New Caledonians, turning out in greater numbers than expected, voted 
a solid ``yes'' in a Sunday referendum that could lead to independence 
in two decades for this French Pacific territory, partial results 
show. ``This is a beautiful success and an encouraging sign for the 
future,'' France's acting interior minister, Jean-Jacques Queyranne, 
said in Paris, where results of the referendum were being made public. 
With 23 of the 33 regions counted, the ``yes'' vote held the lead 
at 76 percent, said the minister, who is replacing ailing Interior 
Minister Jean-Louis Chevenement. The results were likely to be softened 
-- but not drastically modified -- when the count comes in from the 
New Caledonian capital of Noumea. The participation rate stood at 
77 percent despite fears that apathy would prevail among the 107,000 
people registered to take part in the referendum aimed at putting 
to rest decades of division on the archipelago that led to riots and 
bloodshed in the 1980s. New Caledonians were asked to decide whether 
to accept a transition period of ``shared sovereignty'' for the archipelago 
that is 20,000 kilometers (12,430 miles) from France. If they agree 
to that, a new referendum will be held in 15-20 years to decide on 
total independence after 150 years as a French Overseas Territory. 
But apathy was the chief concern of the two sides -- the Rally for 
Caledonia in the Republic -- the RPCR -- and the Kanak and Socialist 
National Liberation Front -- the FLNKS, which led the bloody struggle 
in the 1980s for independence. New Caledonians cast their ballots 
amid mounting social tension, due in part to the plummeting price 
of nickel -- the main resource in New Caledonia, which has an estimated 
30 percent of the world's nickel reserve. Angry dockers last week 
blocked the Noumea port to press demands for improved indemnities 
as part of a plan to let go workers. Workers from an adversary union 
countered, threatening a general strike if access to the port was 
not assured. Elsewhere, small-time miners, threatened by large mining 
groups and diminishing incomes, blocked the main island road to press 
for guarantees that would assure their survival. Residents 18 and 
older were asked if they approve the Noumea Accord signed May 5 providing 
for the transition period toward independence. The accord, concluded 
between Paris, the FLNKS and the RPCR, followed a decade of violence 
in the Pacific island marked by fierce riots and political killings 
in the 1980s that stunned the French and galvanized the search for 
a peaceful solution. The accord provides for a large transfer of powers 
from Paris to Noumea during a transition period. New Caledonia is 
about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) east of Australia. Nearly half 
of the archipelago's population are native Kanaks or Melanesians, 
and about one-third are of European origin. The rest are from other 
parts of Polynesia.
