Some 30,000 workers, farmers and students marched in Seoul Sunday, 
demanding speedy reforms to overcome South Korea's prolonged economic 
crisis. ``It's one year since the economic crisis began but the situation 
has not improved much,'' protesters said in a statement before starting 
the 2-kilometer (1.25-mile) march in southern Seoul. More than 10,000 
riot police were deployed for possible violence. There was some brief 
pulling and pushing between the two sides, but no reports of arrests 
or serious clashes. The march began after a ``people's rally'' on 
a riverbank, during which participants strongly criticized what they 
felt was a lack of progress in resolving South Korea's economic crisis. 
Organizers of the rally, representing 60 labor and civic groups, demanded, 
among other things, that the government disband the nation's bloated, 
debt-ridden conglomerates and increase financial assistance for the 
unemployed. ``The lives of workers are becoming more and more impoverished 
while company heads and government officials who are responsible for 
the crisis have not been properly punished,'' they said in the statement. 
South Korea's family-controlled chaebol, or conglomerates, have come 
under public criticism for their heavy borrowing to expand business, 
which experts say is partly responsible for the country's economic 
crisis. About a dozen conglomerates collapsed under mounds of bank 
debts last year, triggering a flight of foreign capital and fueling 
South Korea's financial crisis. A restructuring of those debt-ridden 
chaebol is a key promise South Korea has made under a dlrs 58 billion 
bailout from the International Monetary Fund late last year. But critics 
say progress in government efforts to restructure the chaebol has 
been slow. South Korea's unemployment rate has risen to a 32-year 
high of 7.6 percent, with 1.65 million people out of work. Workers 
have been complaining that they became scapegoats for corporate mismanagement.
