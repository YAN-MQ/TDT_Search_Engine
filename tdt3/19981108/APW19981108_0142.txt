A dissident based in the central Chinese city of Changsha has begun 
10 days in police detention for attempting to set up an independent 
political group, a human rights group said Sunday. Xie Changfa was 
taken from his home Saturday, a day after he had applied to a Civil 
Affairs office for permission to set up an organization called the 
``China Association to Protect Citizens' Rights and Interests,'' the 
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China 
said. The Hong Kong-based group said police had advised Xie's family 
that he would be held for 10 days for violating regulations on social 
order. Xie, formerly an engineer at the Changsha Steel Works, spent 
two years in a labor camp for his involvement in 1989 pro-democracy 
demonstrations. Along with six other Changsha dissidents, Xie was 
detained for several days in August for requesting permission to hold 
a demonstration appealing for the release of other jailed activists. 
Even seeking police permission to demonstrate, as legally required, 
carries the risk of arrest or of police harassment. The dissidents 
had declared they would register an appeal, as allowed by law, after 
the authorities rejected their protest request. In a separate report, 
the Information Center said Bao Tong, the most senior official jailed 
after the 1989 protests, had been refused a passport, preventing him 
from traveling overseas. Bao hoped to visit his son, Bao Pu, who lives 
in the United States. But police had refused repeated requests for 
a passport, the center cited Bao Pu as saying. Bao Tong was a former 
top aide to Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and once 
ran a think tank studying reforms of China's arbitrary political system. 
He was arrested May 28, 1989, apparently for leaking word that party 
conservatives planned to crush the protests, and was put on trial 
in 1992. Bao was released from jail in May 1996, but spent another 
11 months in police detention after that. Special restrictions attached 
to his release expired in May, entitling him to rights due to any 
citizen, including the right to travel abroad, the center said. It 
speculated that the government might not allow Bao to travel overseas 
because of his knowledge of China's secretive political elite.
