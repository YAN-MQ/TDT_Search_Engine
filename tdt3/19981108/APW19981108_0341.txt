As U.S. officials consulted on a possible military strike against 
Iraq, a top Iraqi official said Sunday that the government would not 
back down on its decision to ban U.N. arms inspections. Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq Aziz told the official Iraqi News Agency that the government 
was not moved by a U.N. Security Council resolution last week holding 
it in ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. edicts. ``Iraq adheres to its 
stance until the Security Council fulfills its obligation toward Iraq,'' 
INA quoted Aziz as saying. This, he said, involved lifting the ban 
on oil sales ``as a start toward the final lifting of the whole embargo.'' 
Iraq's trade minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, also told reporters that 
Iraq is unconcerned with U.S. threats. ``I think nothing is solved 
by military action,'' said Tam Dalyell, a Scottish member of the British 
Parliament who accompanied Reynolds. ``It just creates a bitterness 
between old friends that I deplore.'' Dalyell said Reynolds planned 
to brief U.S. President Bill Clinton about his findings in Baghdad, 
adding: ``I hope it does some good.'' The United States and Britain 
have threatened possible military action to force Baghdad to allow 
U.N. weapons inspections to resume. On Sunday, Clinton was meeting 
at Maryland's Camp David presidential retreat with Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who just completed a tour of the Gulf, and National 
Security Adviser Sandy Berger, who consulted last week with Britain 
and France. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait 
prevent the export of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay, and trade as 
well. Iraq last month announced it was halting cooperation with U.N. 
weapons inspectors until the Security Council begins moving to lift 
the embargo, which has devastated Iraq's economy. The Security Council 
has said the embargo won't be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify 
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as required 
by U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War over the Kuwait occupation. 
Earlier Sunday, Trade Minister Saleh said a possible American military 
strike would be no harder on the country than the sanctions. ``They 
will not kill in a military strike more than they are killing with 
sanctions every day,'' Saleh told reporters during an appearance at 
a Baghdad trade fair. The government has blamed the sanctions for 
shortages of food and medicine as well as the deterioration of its 
water, sewage and electricity systems. These problems, it says, has 
taken the lives of 1.5 million Iraqis over the past eight years, many 
of them children. ``We are losing 4,500 children per month _ that 
means nearly 60,000 per year,'' Saleh said. ``I don't think a military 
strike would kill 60,000 children as sanctions are killing now.'' 
Iraq's decision to halt inspections is aimed at the U.N. Special Commission, 
which is charged with eliminating Iraq's biological and chemical weapons 
as well as long-range missiles. Iraq has demanded that UNSCOM be restructured 
to include fewer American and British experts and that its chairman, 
Australian Richard Butler, be replaced. Iraq has long accused Butler 
of working on behalf of the United States to prolong the sanctions 
as a way to undermine President Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi ban exempts 
monitors from the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy 
Agency. On Sunday, two nuclear monitoring teams went into the field, 
U.N. officials said.
