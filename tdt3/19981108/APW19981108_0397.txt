The conservative party that governed Germany for 16 years appointed 
a new leader to replace Helmut Kohl during a weekend congress, but 
made little progress in defining its role in opposition to a center-left 
government. Kohl, who stepped down as chairman of the Christian Democrats 
after leading them to their worst defeat in postwar German elections 
in September, warned his party to stay united. ``Let us not give in 
to pressure to run after changing trends of political fashion,'' Kohl 
said during a tearful farewell. But younger members as well as special 
interest wings held in check during his 25 years as party chief have 
long yearned for more influence. They're getting their first chance 
to make policy _ and are unlikely to give it up. Kohl's hand-picked 
successor, Wolfgang Schaueble, 56, is charged with modernizing the 
party's image. His ascent signals a shift toward a more pro-market 
image for the party, but its overall opposition strategy has not even 
begun to take shape. ``We have a standpoint, but not a direction,'' 
one delegate complained. How well the party is able to shape itself 
in its new role will be tested in a series of state elections next 
year, starting with Hesse in February. The rejuvenated leadership 
includes Christian Wulff, part of a loose group of Kohl critics mostly 
in their 40s who are known as ``Wild Youth.'' Wulff, who recently 
said the party has ``wasted away,'' won a vice chairman's post. The 
party's new general secretary, Angela Merkel, is from eastern Germany. 
Schaeuble pledged to renew the party into an opposition force during 
his convention speech, chipping away at the 68-year-old Kohl's strong 
legacy by making clear that the party had lost touch with many voters. 
A key task, he said, was regaining votes in economically struggling 
eastern Germany, the formerly communist area where the Christian Democrats 
were routed despite Kohl's image as ``father of German unity.'' ``We 
must open up for new issues and thinking,'' Schaeuble declared. ``The 
CDU must regain its ability to campaign.'' That includes reaching 
out to labor unions and ecology-minded voters, he said. Considered 
a pro-market reformer, Schaeuble was Germany's most popular politician 
in pre-election polls. A loyal Kohl protege who suppressed his own 
yearning for the chancellorship, he has been in a wheelchair since 
an apparently deranged man shot him during campaigning in 1990. Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder's government derided the Christian Democrats' effort 
at renewal. ``The CDU is heading into the future with its eyes on 
the past,'' said Greens party co-leader Gunda Roestel.
