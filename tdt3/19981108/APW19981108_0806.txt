An Israeli government employee was arrested for trying to sell secret 
files to a member of an organized Russian crime ring, Israel radio 
reported said Sunday. Yudmila Kleinman, an employee at Israel's interior 
ministry, is being held in police custody for allegedly stealing files 
on two foreign nationals, one of whom is involved in organized crime, 
and trying to sell the files to the individuals, Israel radio said 
Sunday. She was arrested after a policeman whom she had confided in 
told the authorities, the report said. The radio said a teacher accused 
of acting as a middle man had been briefly arrested and then released. 
Spokesmen for the ministry of interior and the police were not immediately 
available. Over 800,000 people from the former Soviet Union have moved 
to Israel since the collapse of communism. At the same time, Israeli 
police have said they believe gangs of Russian mafia have also tried 
to enter Israel to launder money and influence politicians.
