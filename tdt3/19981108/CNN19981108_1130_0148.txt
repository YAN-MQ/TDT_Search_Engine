Iraq is showing no signs of backing down, even with the looming threat 
of military action. Jane arraf reports. At U.N. headquarters, at the 
heart of the standoff, nuclear monitors went out Sunday, but other 
inspections remained stalled. UNSCOM said it would send home over 
the next few days about two dozen inspectors who have been idled, 
but was still keeping about 100 members of the team on standby. We 
maintain the capacity to go out at very short notice to resume our 
activities so we could start our work again should it be necessary. 
That's the optimistic scenario -- that Iraq will change its mind and 
lift the ban on cooperation. The U.N.'s special envoy for Iraq is 
hoping a flurry of diplomatic efforts could convince Baghdad to let 
inspections resume and defuse the gathering military threat. Talk 
about the security council resolution just passed and its implementation. 
Meanwhile, Iraq kept up its political offensive, saying nothing the 
U.S. and its allies could do would be worse than what it's been through 
already. I don't think a military strike will kill 60,000 children 
as sanctions are killing now, and have killed more than 1.5 million 
Iraqis. Not even France nor Russia, usually sympathetic to Iraq, have 
escaped Baghdad's criticism. But one sympathetic ear, former Irish 
prime minister Albert Reynolds, who arrived in Baghdad to highlight 
the effect of sanctions. Reynolds met with Iraqi deputy prime minister 
Tariq Aziz this morning and said he found him open and flexible. It 
was the same meeting that produced Iraq's official rejection of the 
latest security council move, perhaps a sign that while Baghdad is 
talking tough, it may still be looking for a way out. Jane arraf, 
CNN, Baghdad.
