A surprise at the Paris indoor open. Britain's Greg Rusedski upset 
top seed and world number one Pete Sampras in straight sets. The 13th 
seed slammed 18 aces for a 6-4, 7-6, 6-3 win. Sampras uncharacteristically 
double-faulting six times during the match. He's pretty much kicked 
everyone's butt all week, and he's got the game where he can get hot, 
especially with that serve and he's improved some areas in his game.
