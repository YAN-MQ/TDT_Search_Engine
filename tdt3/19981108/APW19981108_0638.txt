As U.S. officials studied a possible military strike against Iraq, 
Iraqi ministers said Sunday they were not afraid of American attacks 
and would not back down on barring U.N. arms inspections. Trade Minister 
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Iraq has suffered for so long under U.N. 
sanctions that have crippled the country that it has nothing to fear 
from new U.S. threats. ``They will not kill in a military strike more 
than they are killing with sanctions every day,'' Saleh said, referring 
to U.N. Security Council trade sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 
1990 invasion of Kuwait. ``Our country is prepared to face any military 
aggression,'' he said. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz also told 
the official Iraqi News Agency that the government was not moved by 
a U.N. Security Council resolution last week holding it in ``flagrant 
violation'' of U.N. edicts. ``Iraq adheres to its stance until the 
Security Council fulfills its obligation toward Iraq,'' INA quoted 
Aziz as saying. This, he said, involved lifting the U.N. ban on oil 
sales ``as a start toward the final lifting of the whole embargo.'' 
Iraq last month announced it was halting cooperation with U.N. weapons 
inspectors until the Security Council begins moving to lift the embargo, 
which has devastated Iraq's economy. The Security Council has said 
the embargo won't be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq 
has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction, as required by U.N. 
resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War over the Kuwait occupation. 
Iraq says the sanctions, which prevent almost all trade with Iraq, 
have led to the deaths of 1.5 million Iraqis in the past eight years 
_ many of them children _ by causing shortages of food and medicine 
and a deterioration of water and sewage systems. ``We are losing 4,500 
children per month _ that means nearly 60,000 per year,'' Saleh said. 
``I don't think a military strike would kill 60,000 children as sanctions 
are killing now.'' Aziz, the most senior Iraqi official to react to 
the latest U.N. resolution, spoke after meeting a delegation of Irish 
and Scottish politicians who said they opposed the use of force against 
Iraq. ``I think nothing is solved by military action,'' said Tam Dalyell, 
a Scottish member of the British Parliament who accompanied Reynolds. 
``It just creates a bitterness between old friends that I deplore.'' 
Dalyell said the delegation's leader, former Irish Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds, planned to brief U.S. President Bill Clinton about 
his findings in Baghdad, adding: ``I hope it does some good.'' U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, also met 
Sunday with Aziz. Shah refused to give details of the session to reporters.
