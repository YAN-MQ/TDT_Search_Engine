A trial delayed 23 years by Bangladesh's bitter and often bloody politics 
culminated Sunday with a judge convicting and ordering death for 15 
former military commanders in the 1975 assassination of the country's 
first prime minister. Four others, including a former junior minister 
for information, were acquitted in the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 
father of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. After taking office 
in 1996, Hasina used her power to bring her father's killers to trial, 
saying ensuring justice would help entrench democracy in this volatile 
country. Thousands of followers of Sheikh Mujib, as he is popularly 
known in Bangladesh, danced in the streets outside the courtroom to 
celebrate the verdict by Dhaka District Judge Kazi Golam Rasul. Shouts 
of ``justice has prevailed!'' rang out. Rahman, who led the country's 
independence war against Pakistan in 1971, was gunned down by rebellious 
soldiers at his Dhaka residence on Aug. 15 in 1975. Most of his family 
was also killed that day; two daughters survived because they were 
out of the country on holiday. In its 27 years of history Bangladesh 
has witnessed the assassination of two heads of government, three 
military coups and 19 failed coup attempts. Sunday's verdict ended 
the country's first trial of coup leaders in a civil court. Military 
tribunals were set up to try the leaders of other coups. After 149 
days of hearings, the verdict was handed down to retired army officers 
Syed Farooq Rahman, Sultan Shahriyar Rashid Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed, 
Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Aziz Pasha, Shariful Haw Dalim, Bazlul Huda, 
Nor Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Rashed Chowdhury, Ahmed Shariful Hasan, 
Kishmat Hashem, Abdul Majed, Nazmul Ansar and Moslemuddin Ahmed. The 
judge found Taheruddin Thakur, Abdul Wahab Joardar, Marfat Ali Shah 
and Hashem Mridha not guilty. Only five of the accused _ Syed Farooqur 
Rahman, Khan, Ahmed, Wahab and former junior Information Minister 
Thakur _ were in court to hear the verdicts. The government is trying 
to track down the others, all believed to have fled Bangladesh.
