American soldiers are being hailed as heroes in Honduras for saving 
more than 700 people from rising floodwaters. The U.S. military is 
also distributing tons of food and emergency supplies to help the 
survivors of hurricane Mitch. The storm killed an estimated 10,000 
people when it swept through central america. Harris whitbeck has 
more from Nicaragua. Waist-deep in the waters that destroyed his home, 
a man in central Nicaragua uses a hammer to remove the tin roof from 
what was once his house. He will use it to rebuild once he finds a 
dry piece of land. A week after, thousands of people are trying to 
get their lives back in order, but the process is painfully and frustratingly 
slow. U.S. helicopters continue to fly dozens of missions to deliver 
food and medicine to those villages that are still cut off. They are 
part of the multinational effort to distribute desperately needed 
aid. But it still seems like too little for so many people that need 
help. Refugee camps throughout Nicaragua are beginning to experience 
food and medical shortages. Shortages are not felt at the managua 
international airport, though dozens of cargo planes are arriving, 
bringing tons of food. Shortages are not felt at the managua international

launch a Diplomatic offensive in an attempt to get more long-term 
relief for the region. The presidents of central America will meet 
early next week to try to pressure the U.S. and other countries to 
give some financial breathing room to Honduras and Nicaragua. Former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter had voiced that plea after visiting both 
countries on Friday. Meanwhile, attempts to make a distribution more 
fluid are under way, while thousands of survivors wait and hope that 
after having survived the storm, they will not have to face the threat 
of death. From disease or starvation. Harris whitbeck, CNN, lago managua,
