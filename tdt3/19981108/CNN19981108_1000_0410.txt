Israel's defense minister says he expects the Israeli cabinet to ratify 
the U.S.-brokered wye river accord this week. The land-for-security 
deal calls for Israel to turn over 13% more of the West Bank to the 
Palestinians. Debate on the agreement in the Israel cabinet was suspended 
Friday after a Bombing attack in Jerusalem. Meantime, Israeli prime 
minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will continue construction 
on a planned Jewish community in predominately Arab east Jerusalem. 
Groundbreaking at the site may lead to a breakdown in mideast peace 
talks last year.
