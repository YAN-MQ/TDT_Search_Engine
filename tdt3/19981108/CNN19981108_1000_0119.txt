So far, it's still a two-man race to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker 
of the House of Representatives. The declared contenders are congressmen 
Bob Livingston of Louisiana and christopher Cox of California. The 
two men are spending the weekend dialing and smiling, trying to coax 
fellow republicans to vote their way come November 18th, when party 
members will choose a new speaker by secret ballot. Livingston supporters 
claim he is closing in on the 112 commitments needed for a victory. 
But Cox has estimated up to two-thirds of house republicans have yet 
to commit to a candidate. No matter who wins the race for speaker, 
one house member says Gingrich's departure will do the party good. 
I think it was the right thing for him to do and now a whole generation 
of new faces are going to come on the scene, be able to talk to the 
American people. More importantly, listen to them. I think the message 
that we should have learned from this election was that we need to 
focus more on basic principles.
