European soccer officials on Sunday expelled Italian league leader 
Fiorentina from this season's UEFA Cup after an explosion during last 
week's game against Switzerland's Grasshoppers injured a match official 
and caused the suspension of a UEFA Cup game. The decision means that 
the Swiss team will advance to the third round, facing Bordeaux. UEFA's 
Control and Disciplinary Commission said the punishment would have 
been more severe if there had not been mitigating circumstances. Fiorentina 
announced it would appeal. Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 
45 minutes of play. Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 
2-0, it expected easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA 
Cup. But the match in Salerno, near Naples, was suspended after a 
Belgian off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device 
hurled from the stands at the interval. Philippe Flament, the ``fourth 
man,'' helps the referee and linesmen, was taken to hospital with 
a right knee injury. UEFA said that Fiorentina was responsible for 
security both inside and outside the stadium, even though it was not 
playing on its home ground. The game was being played in Salerno because 
Fiorentina was paying the second and last round of suspension of its 
Franchi stadium as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners 
Cup game. However, UEFA conceded that the explosive device was aimed 
at the Fiorentina team and not at the Swiss club or match officials. 
Otherwise, it said, it would have decided on a more severe penalty. 
Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of rivalry. But the club 
wanted to raise funds for victims of recent flooding in southern Italy 
and so played its rival's grounds. Italian papers reported that police 
questioned a local Salerno man who was a suspect.
