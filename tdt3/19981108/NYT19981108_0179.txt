In a philosophical moment last week, Bryan Cox, the New York Jets' 
no longer inflammable linebacker, was discussing Doug Flutie. ``Some 
quarterbacks look like Tarzan and play like Cheetah,'' Cox said. ``Flutie 
looks like Cheetah and plays like Tarzan.'' At least the 5-foot-9-inch 
quarterback had played like Tarzan in guiding the Bills to five consecutive 
victories. But Sunday the Jets' defense turned Flutie into Tarzan's 
pal. After having generated 14 touchdowns this season, Flutie could 
put only four field goals on the scoreboard in the Jets' 34-12 rout. 
``It's been five years since I got my tail kicked like this,'' Flutie 
said, alluding to a Canadian Football League game. ``Their four linebackers 
and four defensive backs gave me trouble. That was the only thing 
we had not seen them do. That was not in our study.'' In winning four 
straight for a 6-3 record that shares first place in the Eastern Division 
with the Miami Dolphins, this Jets team has now won three big games 
_ at New England, in Kansas City and Sunday's domination of the Bills. 
That's what good teams do. That's what contenders for the Super Bowl 
XXXIII playoffs do. But the Jets are careful not to gloat. Not even 
with a visit next Sunday to Indianapolis, where the Colts are 1-8. 
While dissecting Sunday's triumph, Coach Bill Parcells talked about 
how the Colts are ``going to have a lot to say about who wins this 
decision.'' Almost to a man, his players were parroting the coach's 
warning. They talked about the Colts game as if land mines had already 
been planted in the RCA Dome. One reason for that is their memory 
of losing to the Rams in St. Louis, a game they apparently assumed 
they would win. But Sunday, it might have been the taste of Flutie 
Flakes, suddenly the breakfast of champions in Buffalo, that nourished 
the Jets' defense. During their Saturday night meeting a box of the 
quarterback's cereal somehow appeared. Now, in their quiet locker 
room, the defensive backs were talking about it. ``I tasted them,'' 
cornerback Otis Smith said. ``They were pretty good.'' ``We all wanted 
to see what they tasted like,'' safety Chris Hayes said. ``Maybe a 
little too sugary, but pretty good. I'm glad he's got his own box. 
He deserves it.'' ``Hey, that's a trap question; when we go up there,'' 
cornerback Marcus Coleman said, alluding to the Dec. 19 rematch, ``they're 
going to use that against us.'' ``I don't care,'' Smith said. Parcells 
is always warning his Jets to be careful of ``trap'' questions because 
a careless answer could wind up on an opponents' bulletin board. But 
if the Jets contain Flutie in Rich Stadium as effectively as they 
did Sunday, the Bills will need more than a careless answer to a trap 
question. Instead, the Bills will need to find a way to escape the 
trap set for Flutie by Bill Belichick, the Jets' assistant head coach 
and defensive guru. ``We just tried a few little different things,'' 
Parcells said. ``Not run by him, not jump in the air. James Farrior 
stayed on him some of the time.'' Whenever the Bills had third down, 
the Jets' defense was particularly efficient. Out of 12 third-down 
situations, Flutie converted only two, a sad 17 percent compared to 
the Jets' 63 percent. Those two were a 9-yard pass that led to the 
Bills' 3-0 lead and a 36-yard pass en route to their final field goal. 
``The idea was to keep Flutie inside the pocket as much as possible,'' 
Cox said. ``Keep him from running around. And Farrior sort of played 
safety for us back there.'' Against man-to-man coverage, Flutie completed 
only 12 of 30 passes for 154 yards. He was intercepted twice, by Smith 
and Ray Mickens, and sacked twice, by Cox and Mo Lewis. ``We don't 
worry about what our offense has done,'' said Smith, alluding to Vinny 
Testaverde's early interception and two Gerald Sowell fumbles in the 
second quarter. ``Wherever the ball is, we go out there and play.'' 
In addition to Flutie's theatrics, the Bills had been averaging 134 
rushing yards a game during their 5-3 record. ``But we held them to 
48 yards rushing,'' Cox said. ``Shutting them down like that took 
away their play-action plays. That was important because Flutie is 
deadly. They give him the ball, he can go anyplace.'' Mickens praised 
Belichick the way the two-time Super Bowl champion Giants did when 
Belichick was Parcells' defensive coordinator. ``He gets everybody 
looking at the whole game,'' Mickens said. ``Instead of just looking 
at the pass receiver you're supposed to cover when they line up, he 
wants you to look at the fullback, at the other wide receivers.'' 
For the first time this season, the Bills used four wide receivers 
on offense. ``We didn't even practice against that,'' Mickens said, 
``but we adjusted to it.'' And when the pass-rushers got near Flutie, 
they were careful not to jump up, which would allow Flutie to dart 
pass them, and not to run past him. ``The worst place in football,'' 
defensive end Rick Lyle said, ``is behind the quarterback.'' No, the 
worst place in football is in the depths of your division, which is 
where the Jets often have been. But these are different Jets.
