U.S. military engineers are in Honduras to help repair roads, bridges 
and water pipes destroyed by hurricane Mitch. Food aid is slowly being 
directed to the hundreds of thousands of people left homeless by the 
storm. Relief experts say it could take Honduras and Nicaragua more 
than a decade to recover. But the immediate concern is that an epidemic 
of disease might break out. Authorities are rushing to bury the approximately 
10,000 people who were killed in Honduras.
