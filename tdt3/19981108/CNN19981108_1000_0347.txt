A recent federal administration safety ruling may be a way of making 
up for a missed opportunity ten years ago. Two months ago, after Swissair 
flight 111 crashed and killed 229 people, the FAA urged airlines to 
upgrade cabin insulation in thousands of jetliners. Now "The Washington 
Post" reports an agency subcommittee received a memo from a home insulation 
expert in 1988 calling the FAA's insulation flammability test "meaningless." 
The subcommittee reportedly ignored that warning. Air safety officials 
say it's unclear if insulation played a role in the swissair accident.
