Iraq is the topic today at camp David, where President Clinton is 
meeting with his top national security advisers. Among those on hand 
is defense secretary William Cohen. He spent last week in the mideast, 
gauging support for a possible military strike against Iraq. Secretary 
of state Madeleine Albright and the head of the CIA are also taking 
part. National security adviser Sandy Berger flew back from Paris 
for the meeting after talks with French and British leaders. "The 
Washington Post" quotes administration sources as saying the president 
may soon decide to launch cruise missile attacks on Saddam Hussein. 
The Iraqi leader set off the latest crisis by ending his cooperation 
with u.N. weapons inspectors.
