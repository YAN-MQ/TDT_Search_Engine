This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" today into Monday. Showers and storms will develop along 
the gulf coast and move up through the Tennessee river valley. We'll 
also see rain through the central plains by Monday evening. Snow farther 
north into the dakotas and continuing back through the rocky mountains. 
Another system moves into the picture spreading some rain showers 
and mountain snow into the northwest as well. Highs today -- 20s and 
30s from the northern Rockies to the upper midwest. 40s in the northeast. 
Most of the south will see 50s and 60s with a few 70s extreme south. 
Looking ahead to Tuesday, wet weather is in store for the Great Lakes. 
But it should be rain rather than snow. We'll also see rain in the 
northwest. On Wednesday, wet weather moves to New England with showers 
scattered throughout the west. Thursday, rain and snow over the northern 
Great Lakes. Rain showers in the northwest. Remember, you can find 
four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities on CNN interactive.
