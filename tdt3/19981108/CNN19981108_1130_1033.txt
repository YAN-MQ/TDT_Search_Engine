And still to come -- fall is in the air, so sweeps specials are on

me? I like to stand out a bit. That's why I drive a Subaru outback. 
With a big cargo bay and all-wheel drive, you get all the sport-utility

far from ordinary. Like me, really. What a weird looking bunch that 
was. I don't want to buy a new PC every year till commencement. I 
needed one that would keep up with them. Got to save something for 
college. Introducing Your:)Ware from gateway. Call 1-800-gateway and 
we'll custom-build you a gateway PC with an Intel processor and CD-rom 
now for only $31 a month. And in two years you could trade it in toward
