In football jargon, it is called 11 Personnel. It is an offensive 
package complete with three wide receivers and a tight end. The New 
York Jets employed this package early in the third quarter Sunday. 
It was used on the play that separated the Jets from the Buffalo Bills, 
that made a 13-9 game a 20-9 game. Tricky 11 Personnel was used on 
Vinny Testaverde's 36-yard touchdown pass to Dedric Ward. Actually, 
the package and play were similar to those the Jets ran for a Testaverde-to-Ward 
43-yard score four games ago that insured the victory over New England. 
Ward running free down the right sideline. Testaverde tossing a high, 
arcing spiral. Ward sprinting underneath, so fast, past the last line 
of defense. Similar play from similar field position. Finishing, too, 
in a similar spot, in the right, front corner of the end zone. But 
this was the new wrinkle. Ward lined up in the backfield. Two Jets 
receivers were aligned wide left and the tight end was aligned at 
the right end of the offensive line. Ward was in the backfield instead 
of aligned wide right, the way it went in New England. He was in what 
is called I-Under, a step or two to the right and in front of the 
tailback, Curtis Martin. ``That was sneaky,'' said Buffalo safety 
Kurt Schulz, a seven-year veteran. ``It looked like a two-back set 
and then Ward comes out of there in motion and we were stuck. We had 
no cornerback over there. The safety had to take that action.'' The 
Buffalo safety was Henry Jones. ``I had to leave my responsibility 
inside the hash mark, float to the outside, but then I also saw action 
by the tight end,'' Jones said. ``That made me hesitate. And as fast 
as that guy Ward is, he was gone.'' Bills cornerback Thomas Smith 
said: ``That play took Henry out. And then there was no one to cover 
for Henry.'' Defensive end Bruce Smith concluded: ``Whatever the defense 
is called and whatever we do, just play the defense. Get people covered.'' 
This is what Bills Coach Wade Phillips meant when he said his team 
``let things happen.'' What happened was a 34-12 Jets' victory that 
did several things. Among them, it dropped Buffalo's record to 5-4, 
snapped its six-game winning streak against the Jets and dropped the 
Bills into third place _ behind the Jets and Miami _ in the American 
Conference East division race. It was a game in which Buffalo allowed 
the Jets to dictate matters on the field and on the sidelines and 
in the press box with the coaches making the play calls. ``They took 
it to us,'' said Doug Flutie, Buffalo's big-play quarterback of late 
who could only amount 154 passing yards and no touchdowns. He was 
intercepted twice. The Jets made sure he did not beat them with his 
legs, either: He ran three times for only 2 yards. Ward's backbreaking 
play and the tricky 11 Personnel employed was set up by a first half 
of opportunities wasted by the Bills. If Buffalo had taken three gifts 
_ three Jets turnovers in the first 22 minutes _ and had been as imaginative, 
creative and as effective as the Jets would later be, the game might 
have been quite different. On the game's first play, Testaverde was 
intercepted at the Jets' 38. The Buffalo offense took over, gained 
2 yards and punted. With 10 minutes 47 seconds left in the second 
quarter, Buffalo forced a Jets' fumble at their 37. Buffalo lost 1 
yard and punted. With 6:57 left in the second quarter, Buffalo forced 
another fumble, this time at the Jets' 49. The Bills got a field goal 
out of that one. Three turnovers, all in Jets' territory, turned into 
one field goal. Thus, with 4:51 left before halftime, Buffalo led 
by 9-7. With 27 seconds left, the Jets led by 10-9. With 12 seconds 
left, Flutie was intercepted. With no time left, the Jets made a field 
goal and it was 13-9. Missed opportunities for Buffalo and then a 
momentum-swinging play just before halftime. ``That's where I think 
the difference came,'' Flutie said. ``We had our opportunities and 
we didn't take advantage of it. That put us in a tough position late 
in the game.'' It put the Bills under pressure to perform when the 
Jets waltzed out in the second half and were cute and tricky and good 
and tough. ``They played a cat-and-mouse game when they had to, but 
they played plenty of physical football, too,'' Schulz said. It was 
a big game, a big moment, and the Bills blinked. ``Our whole game 
was off,'' Phillips said. ``We need to look at ourselves. We didn't 
come after them.'' They let things happen. Why the hesitancy? ``Today 
was a struggle,'' Flutie said. ``It's not a lot of fun when you lose. 
I'll keep swinging and letting it fly. I don't accept losing very 
easily. I had a rough day. We had a rough day. We are going to bounce 
back from this. You don't take anything from a loss. You get aggravated 
and frustrated. We think we can match up with them.'' Not Sunday. 
The Jets won the matchups, upstairs and downstairs. That turned this 
game into a mismatch. ``We'll get another chance,'' Bruce Smith said 
of the Jets-at-Buffalo rematch on Dec. 19, one game before the end 
of the regular season. ``We'll have to make sure then that it counts 
for something.''
