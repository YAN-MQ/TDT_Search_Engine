a program call it had tech aid is training welfare recipients to tackle 
the year 2000 computer bug. Ann Kellan followed the first group through 
fair training. This woman worked as a manager in a department store 
and lost her job. I lost my job and house and couldn't afford to pay 
my bills. Suzanne blevins was just as low. I'm divorced. I couldn't 
keep a job. I smoked crack cocaine and alcohol, and I've been clean 
now for over a Year. Two women on welfare, both determined to get 
off. They're part of an experiment called "tekaid." Combining the 
resources of mitretek, a technology think tank, Virginia tech, and 
government. The goal is to turn welfare recipients into computer programmers. 
After rigorous testing, including aptitude and personality tests, 
51 welfare recipients were selected. Their next challenge -- pass 
two months of intense computer training. Take your resume. The culmination 
of all the work is a job fair. I've learned a lot as far as just a 
basic computer. Did any of them spark your interest? Yes, all of them. 
Every table I went to. Will there be any job offers made? Absolutely. 
We have an internship program, most of which is during the summer. 
There may be an opportunity to expand that program. Who did you talk 
to? Oh, I've talked to so many different people. And I'm really excited. 
huh? I don't care. I know. Suzanne blevins' hard work paid off. She 
accepted a job with computer science corporation. It's helped me to 
find a better career so I can become self-sufficient. I want kisses. 
Rosslin Davis got a job offer, but because of the location, turned 
it down, and is interviewing for other jobs. Her children, she says, 
are as excited as she with her progress. I promised my son Joshua 
when I started that every day I would teach him what I learned. And 
we've been doing that every night, I've taught him, so he's going 
to be the youngest Y2K programmer ever. Ann Kellan, CNN, Fairfax county, 
Virginia.
