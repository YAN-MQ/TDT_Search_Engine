Joe camel may be gone, but he is finitely not forgotten. RJR Nabisco 
voluntarilstopped using the cartoon camel in its a last year. Tomorrow, 
E federal trade commission goes toourt to try make sure that he never 
returns. ABC's Tim O'Brien repos. It was the fedel trade commission 
that, decades ago,OT tobacco companies to stop running misleading 
ads like Ts one -- L&M filters, just W the doctor ordered. Iits latest 
suit against R.J. Reynolds, the FTC ys this Joe camel ad tgeted kids 
in the pe of getting them hooked on cigarettes as soon as they're 
old enough to legally buy them. Joe camel is simply the most blatant 
effortny tobacco company has ever had in trying target children. The 
most blatant and the most effective, cording to Myers, who says after 
the Joe camel ad ran, the percentage of children who smoked camels 
increased dramatically. Under attack, R.J. Reynolds voluntarily retired 
Joe camel last year, but the FTC wants to prevent the company fever 
bringing him back and to conduct consumer education program to discourage 
youth sming. The research is clear the ads did peuade many young people 
to choose camels over other brands. But it will be much more difficult 
to prove it caed ds to start smoking in the firstlace. And that, say 
some industry analysts, could be a proem for the FTC case. They should 
drop the Joe camel case because the ads are not doing what the ftcccuses 
them of doing. They're not causing kids smoke. In a statement released 
todr.J. Reynolds calls thftc's suit "an exnsive and wasteful attack 
that tramples on the constitutionally protected right of a lawful 
industry advertise a lawful product." Thcompany, which has now replaced 
Joe camel with a decidedly more sensuous model, acknowledges that 
teen sming is a problem. No quarrel tre from the FTC which, in its 
complaint, say of the 400,000eople who die each year ofmoking-related 
illnesses, most began their smoking when they were children. Tim O'Brien,
