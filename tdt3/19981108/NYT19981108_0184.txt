Louis Daniel, who tried to bring the food and atmosphere of the best 
bistros of Paris to Le Chambertin, the classic French restaurant he 
operated for many years in Manhattan, died at his home in Phoenicia 
on Oct. 29. He was 77. He had been suffering from cancer for many 
years, said his wife, Margaret Gibson Daniel. Daniel was born in Brittany, 
France, and made his way to Paris as a teen-ager. He worked in various 
restaurants there until 1942, when, during the German occupation of 
the city, he was taken prisoner and sent to Germany to work in the 
materiel plants. After the war he returned to Paris and the restaurant 
business, working at, among other places, the brasserie across the 
Seine from the police headquarters that the author Georges Simenon 
used as the Brasserie Dauphine, a canteen for the fictional Inspector 
Maigret. In 1950, Daniel joined a group of his colleagues and went 
to Bermuda to help reopen the Castle Harbour Hotel, which had been 
closed during the war. Soon after, Daniel moved on to New York, working 
in the small French restaurants that proliferated in the postwar years. 
He became a U.S. citizen in 1952. In the late 1950s, after eight years 
at Les Pyrenees, a well-known West Side restaurant, he opened Le Chambertin, 
at 348 West 46th St., insisting that its decor and menu reflect the 
better bistros of his youth. The waiters and cooks were French, and 
the menu was classic. Daniel was no more interested in nouvelle cuisine 
than he was in modern decor. In one respect he was well ahead of his 
time. He spent his weekends at his home on the Esopus River in Phoenicia, 
in the Catskills, an area that was then, and to some extent still 
is, known as the French Catskills. Each Sunday night, or Monday morning, 
Daniel piled his station wagon high with fresh produce from his meticulously 
managed four-acre garden, the better to serve his clientele on 46th 
Street during the week. In 1975, he closed Le Chambertin, worn out, 
he said, from the effort involved in maintaining an old-fashioned 
French restaurant in a rapidly modernizing New York. When he announced 
that he planned to become a wine salesman, his colleagues in the restaurant 
world were skeptical. They predicted that his old friends, restaurant 
owners and bartenders, would become tight-fisted when he came calling 
with his wine list. In fact, he became a successful salesman for the 
House of Burgundy, an importer specializing in French wines, winning 
customers in New York and in the Hudson Valley, where in later years 
he spent more and more of his time. As illness slowed his pace in 
the late 1980s, he spent part of the year in Florida, but as an avid 
outdoorsman, he continued to hunt and fish in the Catskills whenever 
he could. Besides his wife of 35 years, he is survived by a sister 
and several nieces and nephews, all of whom live in France.
