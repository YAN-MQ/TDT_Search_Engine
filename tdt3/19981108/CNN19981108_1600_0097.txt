Republicans are trying to figure out their next move now that house 
speaker newt Gingrich is leaving Capitol Hill. Gingrich has announced 
he is resigning as house speaker and will give up his congressional 
seat, rather than "allow the party to cannibalize itself." The decision 
came after the GOP's disappointing congressional showing in tuesday's 
midterm elections. So far, there are two republican contenders for 
the house leadership. They are congressmen Bob Livingston of Louisiana 
and Christopher Cox of california. We are the majority. Have been 
the majority for the last four years, thanks to my friend Newt gingrich. 
I doubt that had Newt Gingrich not been the revolutionary that he 
was, that we would ever had taken the majority status. But we did, 
with his guidance. He was the man who created the situation that enabled 
us to become the majority party in the Congress and the majority party 
in the nation. In effect, we got a majority of governors, we break 
even on state houses, state legislatures. We've got a majority in 
the Senate, we got a majority in the house today. But the problem 
is, we are losing momentum. And what we don't want to do is be a minority 
party in two years. And my speaker's race was integral to our keeping 
the majority party. Bob and I agree across the board on republican 
principles. And without question, Bob Livingston is a pragmatist who 
understands what it means to have a six-vote majority. My view is 
that we should attempt to do those things that are achievable, to 
the extent that legislation cannot be passed because it does not have 
majority support. It should get a hearing. And members should not 
be stifled. Sources tell CNN Missouri representative James talent 
will not run for speaker of the house. The house small business committee 
chair earlier was said to be considering seeking the post.
