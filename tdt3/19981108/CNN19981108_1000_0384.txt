The former leader of the anti-abortion group "operation rescue" has 
filed for bankruptcy. Randall Terry says he did it because of enormous 
debts he owes women's groups and clinics who have successfully sued 
him. He has been ordered to pay a combined $1.6 million to the national 
organization for women and planned parenthood. There are several suits 
still pending. Terry says he could not allow those groups to use his 
money to further their cause.
