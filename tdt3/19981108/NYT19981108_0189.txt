NAPLES, Fla. While the Anaheim Angels, with an offer to Mo Vaughn, 
have shown that huge contracts will be available for the elite free 
agents this winter, those contracts will not be forthcoming from one 
team that had been expected to be a player in the market. The Angels, 
a lawyer familiar with the team's plans said Sunday, have offered 
Vaughn, the Boston Red Sox first baseman for the past seven and a 
half seasons, a six-year contract for more than $12 million a year. 
That offer would indicate that Bernie Williams, most likely the New 
York Yankees' former center fielder, can expect to receive offers 
upward of $12 million a year, but no such offer will come from the 
Colorado Rockies, who had been interested in Williams. ``He's the 
top center fielder on the market, but no one knows where this thing's 
going in dollars and cents,'' Bob Gebhard, the Rockies' general manager, 
said Sunday on the first day of the general managers' meetings. ``I 
had a certain amount of dollars I was going to spend, but I wasn't 
going to wait forever and then maybe not get him. This way we think 
we can patch up three or four spots that we want to improve as opposed 
to just one.'' The Rockies instead re-signed their own center fielder, 
Darryl Hamilton, last Thursday to a three-year, $10.5 million contract. 
``We signed him to play,'' Gebhard said. ``He's our center fielder. 
We're out of the center-field hunt.'' The Rockies also had been expected 
to pursue Kevin Brown for their pitching staff, but late Saturday 
night they signed a less expensive free-agent pitcher, Brian Bohanon. 
Bohanon, a 30-year-old left-hander, whom the New York Mets traded 
to Los Angeles this past season for Hideo Nomo, agreed to a three-year, 
$9 million contract. The Rockies plan to put him in their starting 
rotation with Darryl Kile, Pedro Astacio, John Thomson and Jamie Wright. 
What happened to the Rockies' interest in Brown, who with Randy Johnson 
is the most attractive pitcher on the free-agent market? ``Scott Boras,'' 
Gebhard said, referring to Brown's agent, ``told me two days ago they 
definitely want six years, and we don't have the appetite for six 
years.'' The Dodgers had hoped to re-sign Bohanon, but the Rockies 
moved quickly and decisively, said Alan Hendricks, the pitcher's agent. 
``There was a lot of activity on Bohanon,'' Hendricks said. ``If I 
was willing to have done two guaranteed years and a third-year option, 
I could have had as many as 18 offers out of 30 teams. But when I 
said I wanted three guaranteed years, we had six proposals.'' The 
Rockies won the race despite the specter of pitching at Coors Field, 
a hitters' park. ``Any pitcher who says he doesn't have concern pitching 
there would be a liar,'' Hendricks said. ``I think every National 
League pitcher has concern. But he's accepted the challenge. If he 
was going to be worried about it, there were plenty of other offers.'' 
Bohanon, whose 1998 salary of $350,000 had been the highest of his 
six-year major league career, had a 7-11 record and a 2.67 earned 
run average in 18 starts and 21 relief appearances with the Mets and 
the Dodgers.
