The Asian economic crisis is taking its toll on one of the world's 
most endangered species -- the sumatran Tiger. Many concerned Australians 
are trying to help out. They've recently sent boxes of frozen Kangaroo 
meat to help feed about 30 starving sumatran tigers being held at 
an Indonesian safari park. It's the third 16-ton shipment so far. 
Only 400 sumatran tigers now exist in the world.
