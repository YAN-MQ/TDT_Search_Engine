While the New York Islanders' acquisition of Ted Donato from the Boston 
Bruins on Saturday was not the big one their fans have eagerly been 
awaiting, it was a move that could significantly improve an offense 
that has struggled at times. Donato, a three-time 20-goal scorer, 
joined his new teammates in Toronto for an afternoon practice Sunday 
and was expected to play against the Maple Leafs on Monday night. 
Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager, said on Saturday 
that Donato, a speedy 29-year-old left wing, will flank center Robert 
Reichel on the second line. Donato's arrival probably means a reduction 
in playing time for wings Mariusz Czerkawski and Jason Dawe, who have 
been struggling. Donato, who will make slightly more than $1 million 
this season, knew his days as a Bruin were numbered. Still, he was 
shocked when, after the Bruins played on Saturday, he was told he 
had been dealt for Ken Belanger, the enforcer. Donato was leaving 
the town where he was born and raised, where he refined his skills 
at Harvard and spent all of his seven seasons in the National Hockey 
League. ``It was a surprise,'' said the 5-foot-10-inch, 183-pound 
Donato, who figures to see time on power play and penalty-killing 
units. ``But I guess part of me knew it was coming. It was a strange 
feeling.'' He added: ``I'm looking forward to playing for the Islanders. 
It will be a good opportunity for me.'' Donato was off to a fine start 
last season before being derailed by a three-game suspension for a 
slash to the face of Islander defenseman Rich Pilon. After the suspension, 
Donato never again found his groove. His playing time was reduced, 
and it did not increase this season. He has been ineffective (1 goal 
and 3 assists in 13 games) in limited ice time so far and became expendable 
when the Bruins re-signed Anson Carter last Thursday. Donato apologized 
to Pilon by telephone the day after the incident last season. He said 
Pilon was more understanding than expected. The two talked briefly 
at practice Sunday. Donato's shift to Long Island will be a homecoming 
for his wife, Jeannine, who is from West Islip, N.Y. ``If anything 
could make it easier, it's because she's from Long Island,'' he said. 
Donato also has many friends on Long Island. He has already played 
on teams with some of his new teammates: Czerkawski, Bryan Smolinski 
and Barry Richter in Boston, Scott Lachance and Joe Sacco on the U. 
S. Olympic team, and Bryan Berard on the U. S. world championship 
team. ``I have confidence that I can go out and help this team offensively 
and defensively,'' Donato said.
