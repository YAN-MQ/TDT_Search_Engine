There was no question that New York Jets offensive lineman Jumbo Elliott 
was trying to set the tone early in his matchup against Bruce Smith, 
the future Hall of Fame defensive end for the Buffalo Bills. In the 
first quarter, Elliott jammed the flat part of his right hand into 
Smith's face so hard, Smith's head snapped back like a Pez dispenser. 
Greetings, Mr. Smith, and welcome to the Meadowlands. Had Smith not 
had a face-mask, he would have needed dental work. Not that anyone 
should feel bad for Smith, because later in the quarter he returned 
the favor, smacking Elliott in the head with a swift right hook. ``He 
came over and apologized,'' Smith said of Elliott. ``And I did it 
back to him and then apologized. It was due courtesy to a good player.'' 
Elliott said: ``Bruce said he apologized? That's funny. Well, he's 
such a great player, he can say whatever he wants. He's getting better 
with age.'' Who won the battle of the punches? It was a draw. Who 
won the battle of two of the best linemen in football in a classic, 
hard-fought battle? Decision, Elliott, whose solid play at left tackle 
against Smith at right defensive end was one of the main reasons the 
Jets beat the Bills, 34-12, and are now tied with Miami for first 
place in the American Football Conference East. Elliott had assistance, 
of course, from his fellow offensive linemen, who would occasionally 
slide over to help Elliott with a double team. Try to single block 
Smith constantly, and sooner or later he will send your quarterback 
to the hospital. ``We gave Bruce so many different looks,'' said fullback 
Keith Byars. ``Single team, double team, triple team; we tried to 
keep him off-balance. As long as Bruce Smith is in this league, he 
will be double-teamed.'' The times he was not, Elliott used his massive 
frame as a roadblock. Great players. Classic battle. They have done 
it before. While the focus of the game was on the glitz, on Heisman 
Trophy winners and Flutie Flakes, the game always comes down to the 
play in the trenches. In the case of Elliott and Smith, they know 
each other well, and Elliott always plays well against him. But while 
the two men have faced each other often, they have gone against each 
other in big games just twice. This game was the second. The first 
was almost 10 years ago. It was Super Bowl XXV in January 1991, and 
Elliott, in just his second season with the Giants, was coming off 
an impressive two-game stretch in which he had shut down pass rushers 
Richard Dent of Chicago and Charles Haley of San Francisco. Then came 
the Super Bowl against the Bills. Smith thought he would destroy Elliott. 
Then, there was no reason to doubt him. Smith was the best defensive 
lineman in football _ and he was not shy about saying so. Yet it would 
be the quiet Elliott who would shut down Smith. Without Elliott's 
play, the Giants would not have won that game. Fast forward to this 
afternoon, and the same thing can be said. Smith has been a terror 
against the Jets, sacking the team's quarterbacks 29{ times in his 
career, the most sacks for Smith against any club. Ken O'Brien, Neil 
O'Donnell, Tony Eason, Browning Nagle, Boomer Esiason, Frank Reich, 
Glenn Foley, Bubby Brister, Jack Trudeau, Jeff Blake and Troy Taylor 
have all looked across the line, seen the muscular Smith and checked 
their insurance policies. Vinny Testaverde did not need Allstate. 
Only twice did the Jets quarterback, unlike his predecessors, actually 
feel Smith breathing down his back. Elliott and the rest of the Jets' 
line protected Testaverde as if he was on the endangered species list, 
holding Smith to one sack, which he got late in the game when it was 
out of hand. Smith had four tackles. ``I saw more double teams than 
I saw all year,'' Smith said. ``It shows a great deal of respect they 
have for me, I guess. But the bottom line is, I have to beat two men.'' 
Elliott, always humble, did nothing but praise Smith, wanting to deflect 
attention from himself, which is hard for a 300-pound left tackle 
to do. There were at least 15 times when Elliott and Smith were matched 
up one-on-one, and Smith beat Elliott only once. Those are results 
any offensive lineman would take. Elliott was also effective blocking 
Smith on running plays. In the third quarter, on second down and 2, 
Elliott pushed Smith several yards down the line of scrimmage, clearing 
the way for running back Curtis Martin to pick up 3 yards and the 
first down. ``Please don't say I played well against him,'' Elliott 
said. ``He'll get riled up for the next time we play them.'' Too late. 
The word is already out. Elliott may be one of the few tackles who 
can actually slow the 300-pound Smith. ``Yeah, Jumbo played great, 
he really did,'' Byars said. ``Jumbo is so humble, he would never 
say that. But there is no question he gave Bruce all he could handle.''
