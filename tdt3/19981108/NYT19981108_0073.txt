A variety of inclement conditions are expected from the southern Rockies 
to the northeast Plains as a large disturbance redevelops over Kansas. 
Travel will be difficult through the high ground of southern Colorado 
and northern New Mexico due to periods of snow whipped by 40 mile 
an hour winds. Light to moderate snow will fall in the mountains of 
Wyoming and across much of Montana. Flurries are expected in higher 
elevations of Idaho and central Utah. A corridor of warmer and more 
moist air will stream inland from the western Gulf of Mexico into 
the Mississippi Valley. Bands of showers and a few thunderstorms are 
likely in the central and eastern Gulf States, except for Florida 
where sunshine will prevail. Advancing warm air will be resisted by 
retreating chilly air in the Ohio and upper Mississippi Valleys. As 
a result, rain will develop from northern Illinois westward across 
Iowa to eastern Nebraska. Farther north, a mixture of snow, sleet 
and rain is expected from central Wisconsin to eastern South Dakota. 
Wet snow should accumulate between two and four inches in an area 
from northwest Wisconsin to central North Dakota. High pressure stretching 
from the eastern Carolinas to southern Quebec will sponsor near seasonal 
readings from the Northeast to the Middle Atlantic States. Clouds 
and some fog will cover the Appalachians as ribbons of clouds drift 
across southern New England and the Southeast. Cooler air will be 
ushered into California on gusty winds. Clouds will yield to sun in 
the deserts. The Northwest will be chilly with limited sunshine. FOCUS: 
First of the Season The first rain in several weeks dampened the interior 
Southeast on Sunday morning and the first significant snows fell on 
the high plains of central Colorado on Saturday. Each of these events 
signify a shift from the prevailing weather pattern. Indeed, Atlanta 
had measured only a quarter of an inch of rain since late September, 
while Denver finally noticed its first inch of snow this season, about 
three weeks later than usual. The jet stream will undergo a large 
transformation this week which will produce many more firsts of the 
season from the West Coast to the Great Lakes.
