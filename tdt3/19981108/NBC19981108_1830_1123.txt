When we continue -- the case against big tobacco. Two former insiders 
are about to go public. i'm 64. Is there anything I can do to stop 
bone loss? Absolutely. Here's proof. In a landmark clinical study, 
caltrate actually stopped bone loss... in women at risk for osteoporosis. 
Whatever your age: life's an adventure! Because you're over 50 and 
still exploring! So take the centrum made just for you. Centrum silver. 
With age-essential nutrients... specially adjusted to keep pace with 
your changing nutritional needs. Centrum silver: MA, if you have trouble 
sleeping, take a unisom. It helped last time, didn't it? Didn't you 
feel better after a good night's sleep? It's O.K. the doctor said 
it's not habit forming. That's right. Unisom. MA, there's nothing 
wrong with helping yourself get a good night's sleep. All right? I 
love you, too.
