There is no evidence that two Israelis arrested on spying charges 
during the weekend in Cyprus were working for Israel, the Cypriot 
government said Sunday. ``From the investigations to date, nothing 
has transpired to link this issue with the government of Israel,'' 
the Cypriot Justice Ministry said. The two men were arrested Saturday 
in the small community of Ziyi, near the southern coastal resort of 
Larnaca. Cypriot police said they found cameras, tapes of conversations 
between police, radio scanners and maps in the apartment the two were 
renting. Israel TV said the two men arrived three weeks ago during 
a military training exercise in the area. Asked whether the two men 
in custody worked for Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 
``every Israeli citizen is important to us.'' ``We'll clarify this, 
and of course we'll bring them home,'' Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 
2 TV. Israeli consulate officials visited the men Saturday and Sunday. 
A Cypriot police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
the Israelis were suspected of spying for Turkey, which invaded and 
occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974. Turkey has increased 
military cooperation with Israel in the past two years, chilling Israel's 
relations with Cyprus. Israel has insisted that its ties with Turkey 
are not directed against any other countries in the region. Some Israeli 
press reports speculated about whether the pair's presence had anything 
to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of anti-aircraft missiles from 
Russia. Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots how to bomb 
the missile batteries once they are installed. Cypriot President Glafcos 
Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would deploy the 
missiles. The arrest came three days after Israeli President Ezer 
Weizman ended a three-day visit to the island. The visit, the first 
by an Israeli president, was hailed as ushering in a new era in the 
lukewarm relations between the two countries. Cyprus' ambassador to 
Israel said he hoped the arrests won't further harm relations between 
the countries. ``We want to look at this through the prism of the 
good relations we have with Israel because ... we treasure these relations,'' 
Euripides Evriades told Israel's Channel Two TV. A hearing for the 
two men was scheduled Nov. 16.
