New Caledonians turned out in force Sunday to ratify a referendum 
on ``shared sovereignty'' that could lead to independence in two decades 
for this French Pacific territory. The ``yes'' vote for a transition 
period giving broad new powers to this territory 20,000 kilometers 
(12,430 miles) from Paris totaled 71.8 percent of the ballots cast, 
the Ministry for Overseas Territories in Paris announced. The participation 
rate, higher than expected, totaled 74 percent of the 107,000 people 
registered for the referendum, the ministry said. ``Today, there is 
a majority of people who want to work together and decide our own 
future,'' said the leader of New Caledonia's pro-independence movement 
Rock Wamytan. The referendum was a grassroots confirmation of the 
Noumea Accord reached May 5 and designed to put to rest decades of 
division on the archipelago that led to riots and bloodshed in the 
1980s. New Caledonians were asked to decide whether to accept a transition 
period of ``shared sovereignty'' for the archipelago, a French territory 
for the past 150 years. The Noumea Accord was signed by Paris, the 
Rally for Caledonia in the Republic -- the RPCR -- and the Kanak and 
Socialist National Liberation Front -- the FLNKS, which led the bloody 
struggle for independence. Both pro- and anti-independence parties 
had pressed for citizens to vote ``yes,'' with each side interpreting 
the accord to his liking. The transition period will allow for New 
Caledonian to directly run sectors like taxes, foreign trade, transport 
and communications, while leaving to Paris key sectors like defense, 
justice and police. A bill to lay the groundwork for the changes is 
to go through parliament, likely in December. The Territorial Congress 
will have the power to adopt specific laws. But the key feature of 
the accord is a new referendum to be called in 15-20 years to decide 
on independence. Conservative President Jacques Chirac expressed ``delight 
that Caledonians have made the choice of consensus and responsibility 
in preparing their future,'' the president's office said. Socialist 
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, one of those signing the Noumea Accord, 
said the result confirms that ``New Caledonians want to write together 
new pages in their common history.'' There were unfounded fears in 
Paris and Noumea that apathy would prevail on referendum day. Mounting 
social tension marked by strikes has preoccupied the population, hit 
by the plummeting price of nickel -- the main resource in New Caledonia, 
which has an estimated 30 percent of the world's nickel reserve. Angry 
dockers last week blocked Noumea's port to press demands for improved 
indemnities in a plan to let go workers. Others threatened a general 
strike. And small-time miners, threatened by large mining groups and 
diminishing incomes, blocked the main island road to press for guarantees 
that would assure their survival. New Caledonia is about 800 miles 
(1,300 kilometers) east of Australia. Nearly half of the population 
are native Kanaks or Melanesians, and about one-third are of European 
origin. The rest are from other parts of Polynesia.
