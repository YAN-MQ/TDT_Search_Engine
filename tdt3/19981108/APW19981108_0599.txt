A political backlash gathered strength Sunday against Russia's Communist 
Party, which incited old animosities last week when it failed to condemn 
a member's virulent anti-Semitism. A powerful business tycoon and 
a former prime minister both called for banning the party over its 
support of Albert Makashov, a Communist member of parliament who recently 
blamed the country's problems on ``zhidy,'' or ``yids.'' Former Prime 
Minister Yegor Gaidar, raising the specter of Nazi Germany, said the 
incident proved that the party had evolved into fascism. ``Fascist 
ideology is banned all over the world,'' he said on Russian television. 
``If Russia wants to remain a democratic state, it should ban the 
Communist Party.'' The other prominent voice urging a ban was that 
of Boris Berezovsky, one of the country's richest and most powerful 
men, whose own Jewish origins have frequently served as a lightning 
rod for Russian anti-Semites. ``As was the case with the Soviet Union, 
which split into ethnic entities, the Communists are now causing the 
Russian Federation to split into ethnic entities,'' Berezovsky said, 
according to the Interfax news agency. President Boris Yeltsin condemned 
the party Friday for its stance, and several prominent Russian liberals 
said the government should at least consider banning the Communists. 
Yeltsin banned the Communists once before, for a year following the 
failed 1991 coup attempt against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
It seems unlikely that any attempt to ban the party now would succeed. 
Alexander Shokhin, a pro-government member of parliament, noted Sunday 
on national television that the government would need documented proof 
that anti-Semitism was the official policy of the party. While many 
people might argue that was true, it could be difficult to prove. 
Still, the remarks last month by Makashov were hardly surprising: 
Anti-Semitism is deeply ingrained in Russia, and is increasingly given 
expression by Communist and nationalist politicians. In an interview 
with the newspaper Zavtra, Makashov had said that Jews ``drink the 
blood of the indigenous peoples of the state; they are destroying 
industry and agriculture.'' The Communist-dominated Duma, the lower 
house of parliament, refused to censure him last week, and many members 
openly offered support. Some Communist speakers at Saturday rallies 
celebrating the 81st anniversary of Russia's revolution said Makashov 
was a hero who was unfairly vilified by other politicians and the 
press for his remarks. ``By expressing their solidarity with Makashov 
at a rally in Moscow on Nov. 7, the Communists placed themselves outside 
civilized laws and outside Russian laws,'' said Berezovsky. Berezovsky, 
who heads the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition 
of former Soviet republics, also said that the Communist Party was 
to blame for the collapse of the Soviet Union and ``must be immediately 
banned.'' Among others weighing in was former Deputy Prime Minister 
Anatoly Chubais, who said a ban should be seriously considered. The 
Communists are the country's leading opposition group and have the 
largest faction in parliament's lower house, the State Duma. The Communists 
have frequently criticized Russia's business ``oligarchs,'' including 
Berezovsky, saying they have taken control of large chunks of the 
economy through corrupt, insider deals. The businessmen in turn have 
been critical of the Communists, saying they are determined to keep 
economic control in state hands.
