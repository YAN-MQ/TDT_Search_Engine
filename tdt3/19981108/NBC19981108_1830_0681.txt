The republican wrangling on Capitol Hill will not slow the presidential 
impeachment process now moving through Congress. But the opinions 
expressed in Tuesday's election by voters have not gone unnoticed. 
John Palmer is at the White House tonight. The White House has avoided 
specific comment on what effect it thinks the election results will 
have on the impeachment hearings. President Clinton labeled the vote 
a call for Congress to get back to work. The American people sent 
us a message that would break the eardrums of anyone that would listen. 
Privately, White House officials are elated. They believe the election 
greatly reduced the chances that the full House of Representatives, 
or even the Judiciary committee will vote to impeach the president. 
I do think the wisdom of the American people should be looked at by 
every member of the committee, which is, they don't believe there 
is an impeachable offense here. Two days after the election, congressman 
Henry Hyde, who will chair the hearings, denied his committee will 
be affected by the vote. But he quickly announced a streamlining of 
the process, and sent a letter to Mr. Clinton, asking him to admit 
or deny a series of statements made by independent counsel Kenneth 
Starr in his report. The White House is studying the request. Today, 
democrats and republicans agreed on the need for a speedy hearing. 
I have felt for a long time that people want to get impeachment over 
with fairly and expeditiously. I don't believe that you will ultimately 
see any impeachment proceeding moving forward to the Senate. I think 
the American people want to get it over, but if you think this is 
a Referendum to sweep it under the rug, you're wrong. White House 
lawyers have promised to respond promptly to the committee chairman's 
questionnaire. They too say they want a speedy impeachment hearing.
