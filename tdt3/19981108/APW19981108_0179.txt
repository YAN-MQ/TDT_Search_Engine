Hiromi Kobayashi birdied the third extra hole in a playoff Sunday 
against American Tina Barrett and won the Japan Classic, the season's 
next to last event on the U.S. LPGA Tour. Kobayashi, a regular on 
the U.S. tour, needed birdies on three of the last four holes to force 
the playoff with Barrett, who already had finished at 11-under-par 
205 for the regulation 54 holes after a 6-under 66 Sunday. Kobayashi 
shot a 69 Sunday en route to her second victory this year and fourth 
overall on the U.S. tour. The title was worth dlrs 120,000 from a 
purse of dlrs 800,000. ``When I dropped a stroke to 7-under on the 
11th hole, I thought it would be challenging for me to win,'' said 
the 35-year-old Kobayashi. ``I was able to regain the rhythm, and 
confidence, with the birdie on the 14th,'' she said. On the par-5 
16th, she chipped in for a birdie from the edge of the green, and 
then she birdied the final two holes. Both Kobayashi and Barrett parred 
the first two playoff holes. On the third, Barrett three-putted for 
a bogey from 13 feet (4 meters), while Kobayashi sank a 3-foot (1-meter) 
birdie putt. As a star player on the Japan LPGA Tour, Kobayashi also 
has won nine Japanese tournaments in 13 years as a pro. She joined 
the U.S. tour in 1990, and won two U.S. LPGA tournaments in 1993. 
Following a long drought, Kobayashi won the Rainbow Foods LPGA Classic 
in August, also in a playoff. ``I did my best,'' said Barrett, who 
was seeking her first title since winning the Mitsubishi Motors Ocean 
State Open in 1989. ``But Hiromi played better in the playoff.'' Overnight 
leader Lorie Kane of Canada turned in a 73 and was alone in third 
place at 207. LPGA Hall of Famer Betsy King shot a 70 and shared fourth 
with Helen Alfredsson and Taiwan's Huang Yu-chen. Alfredsson shot 
a 71 and Huang a 74. Annika Sorenstam, who leads the points race for 
U.S. LPGA Player of the Year and is on top of the money earnings list, 
skipped this tournament. So did South Korean rookie sensation Se Ri 
Pak, who has already clinched 1998 Rolex Rookie of the Year honors. 
She was forced to withdraw due to illness and fatigue. After receiving 
South Korea's second highest sports medal from President Kim Dae-jung 
on Friday, Pak left Seoul for the United States Saturday to prepare 
for the Tour Championship tournament.
