In rites attended by followers of Taoism from Chinese communities 
abroad, officials have unveiled a 33-meter-high (110-foot-high) statue 
of Lao-tze, the sage who founded the faith 2,500 years ago. Musicians 
played horns and wooden blocks while priests performed a ritual known 
as ``opening the light'' to christen the 100-ton copper statue Friday 
in Maoshan, a town near the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing. Taoism, 
the oldest indigenous Chinese religion, is based on Lao-tze's book 
the ``Dao De Jing,'' which urges followers to live in harmony with 
nature and revere their ancestors. Communist Chinese leaders have 
allowed Taoism to flourish in recent years, after suppressing it for 
decades. Temples were closed and, during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, 
many were destroyed. Today, Taoism has several million followers in 
China, with 25,000 priests and nuns and 1,500 temples, mostly in eastern 
China. Taoism also has a large following in Chinese communities abroad. 
The unveiling of the Lao-tze statue was attended by delegations from 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore. ``All religions are trying 
hard to educate their young and advertise their own theories. For 
the Taoist people, we should also positively do the same so that young 
people can embrace this religion,'' said Weng Taiming, mistress of 
the Kaohsiung Taoist House in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The 7 million yuan 
(dlrs 840,000) statue in Maoshan, the biggest depiction of Lao-tze 
in China, was paid for by donations from abroad and the official Chinese 
Taoist Association.
