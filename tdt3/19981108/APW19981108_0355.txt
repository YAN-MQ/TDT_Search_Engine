Rescuers lost hope on Sunday of finding 15 crew members from a trawler 
that capsized off the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa, an official 
said. Neil Brink, port captain of Richard's Bay, said no additional 
survivors had been found since rescue efforts started on Saturday. 
``We expect the bodies to start surfacing by tomorrow,'' Brink said. 
The Greek captain, Stamatis Stogiannos, 58, was picked up alive near 
the St Lucia lighthouse on Saturday. ``The ship overturned and sank 
within 30 seconds, according to information from the survivor. The 
guys didn't have much of a chance to get into life rafts,'' Brink 
said. The 28-meter (84-foot) trawler Daniela, registered to a Greek 
company in the South African port of Durban, appears to have sunk 
on Saturday, not on Friday as initial reports indicated, the South 
African Press Association reported. Two Air Force planes, a port helicopter, 
police and the National Sea Rescue Institute helped in the search. 
Brink said they found debris including two lifebouys, two life jackets, 
and plastic and wooden items.
