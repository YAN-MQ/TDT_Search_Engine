Americans are spending more of what they earn. But figures that show 
a shrinking savings rate don't tell the whole story. Kelli Arena reports. 
Not since the 1930s have Americans spent more and saved less. The 
consumers relying on credit cards and home equity loans, the national 
savings rate fell in September to Negative 0.2%, but economists are 
unfazed. The savings rate has been turning downward fairly steadily 
for the last four years at a pretty sharp clip and that looks problematic. 
However, if you were to look at wealth data released from the U.S. 
government on an annual basis, you'll see that over the three years 
ending in 1997, we saw the largest real wealth gain on record. He's 
referring to wealth gained in the stock market through investments 
such as 401Ks and mutual funds. The government's report does not include 
increases in those investments when calculating the national savings 
rate. Many investors do. As long as the market generally continues 
higher, analysts expect people will continue to spend. Fueling economic 
growth. The situation is that today's workers have accumulated more 
wealth and have saved more than their parents or their grandparents.
