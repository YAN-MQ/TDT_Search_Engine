Steffi Graf extended her perfect record against Nathalie Tauziat by 
beating the second-seeded Frenchwoman 6-3, 6-4 to win the Leipzig 
Open for the fifth time Sunday, capping a comeback from wrist surgery. 
In her first tournament after a two-month layoff, Graf collected the 
105th title of her career and raised her record against Tauziat to 
20-0, without ever dropping a set. Her career curtailed by injuries 
in the last couple of years, Graf was unseeded in a tournament for 
the first time in 13 years. She had surgery to remove bone spurs from 
her right wrist two months ago. The 29-year-old German struggled in 
her early matches but kept on winning to reach the final of the dlrs 
450,000 indoor event. ``I never expected this win so I am very happy 
to have achieved it,'' Graf said. ``After all the injuries it's not 
so easy to come back.'' Graf now has a chance of qualifying for the 
season-ending Chase Championships in New York later this month. She 
will play in Philadelphia next week. ``I kept improving from match 
to match and I am surprised myself by my performance,'' Graf said. 
``In the last four days I kept changing my ticket to Philadelphia.'' 
Tauziat, 31, was the Wimbledon finalist this year, when she broke 
into the Top 10 for the first time. She is ranked No. 9 in the world. 
Graf, who held the No. 1 spot for a record 377 weeks, went into the 
tournament ranked No. 22. She will now move to No. 17. In a battle 
of two veterans on the tour, Tauziat had to save five break points 
in the very first game. Graf broke serve for a 3-2 lead thanks to 
a Tauziat double-fault. After trading breaks in the next two games, 
Graf saved a break point in the eighth game. Earlier in the week, 
she broke Martina Navratilova's 13-year-old record for earnings in 
women sports. In the Leipzig tournament, which she helped establish, 
Graf now has a 25-0 record. During her injury layoff, Graf spoke of 
possible retirement. But she has said this week that she intends to 
continue playing if she remains healthy.
