Hale Irwin finally closed his season with a victory, blasting past 
a star-filled field Sunday to win his first Senior Tour Championship. 
Irwin finished with a 65, 14-under 274, for his seventh victory of 
the year and his 20th Senior title since joining the tour in 1995. 
He won dlrs 347,000. He was five shots ahead of defending champion 
Gil Morgan, who had a 71. Jay Sigel, the 1996 winner, was third at 
280 after a 70. ``All in all, this has got to be at least as good 
as last year,'' said Irwin, who won nine times and earned more than 
dlrs 2.3 million in 1997. Irwin has come to The Dunes Golf and Beach 
Club a top contender the past four years. Something _ the cold weather, 
poor iron play, hitting the wrong ball _ has always kept him down 
in The Dunes. In 1995, he marked his ball at Jim Dent's marker on 
the 16th hole during the third round, took a four-stroke penalty and 
shot 75 to fall from the leaderboard. A year later, Irwin couldn't 
overcome frigid, 30 mph (50 kph) wind gusts as he shot 75-76 in the 
middle two rounds. Last year, he trailed by two at the start of the 
final round, but was beaten by Morgan's tournament record 272. While 
Irwin already had secured the money title, Morgan's six wins and steady 
play gained him a following for Player of the Year. Morgan appeared 
ready to add another victory after a birdie at No. 3 gave him a two-shot 
lead. But birdies at eight and nine enabled Irwin to tie Morgan at 
9-under. Two more birdies at Nos. 10 and 11 put him ahead to stay. 
When Irwin got his seventh birdie at the 16th for a five-stroke lead, 
there was no question who was No. 1 on the Senior PGA Tour. Irwin 
led the Seniors in putting, greens in regulation and birdies per round 
this year. His scoring average of 68.59 broke Lee Trevino's 1990 mark 
of 68.89. ``I thought it was important to end the year on a good note,'' 
Irwin said. Morgan finished with 15 straight pars. Jim Albus, who 
trailed by one through seven holes, faded with bogeys at eight and 
nine. Ray Floyd, the 1994 champion who was only a shot behind at the 
start, faded to a 76 and finished at 285. Floyd hit a tree on the 
second hole and made double bogey. He dumped his approach at No. 4 
in the water for bogey. He made two more bogeys on the front nine 
for a 40.
