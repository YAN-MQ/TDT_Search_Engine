Republicans are trying to figure out their next move now that house 
speaker newt Gingrich is leaving Capitol Hill. Yesterday, Gingrich 
said he would resign as house speaker and give up his congressional 
seat, rather than "allow the party to cannibalize itself." The decision 
came after the GOP's disappointing congressional showing in tuesday's 
midterm elections. So far, the two republican contenders for the house 
leadership are congressmen Bob Livingston of Louisiana and Christopher 
Cox of California. One republican says the party needs someone who 
can adequately fill the leadership vacuum. What was the message in 
Tuesday's election, that's why I'm running, and I think the message 
was the party does not fare well. We had no message wean no likable, 
believable messenger. We have to improve education and get local control, 
not federal control, deal with social security and to make it work 
for seniors and as well as generation X. limited government, lower 
taxes for American families and strong defense. Largent today challenged 
house majority leader Dick Armey. Another republican, Jennifer dunne, 
indicates she may also join the race.
