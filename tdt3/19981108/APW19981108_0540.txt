Accusing Yasser Arafat of betraying his people, leaders of radical 
Palestinian groups announced Sunday that they would block any effort 
to amend the Palestinian National Charter. Arafat's new accord with 
Israel called for the Palestinians to amend their charter to eliminate 
language calling for the destruction of the Jewish state. Ahmed Jibril, 
head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command, said at a meeting denouncing the agreement that Arafat had 
``relinquished the Palestinian land and people and betrayed the Palestinian 
cause.'' George Habash, leader of the separate Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, said Arafat ``no longer represents the Palestine 
Liberation Organization or the Palestinian National Council,'' the 
Palestinians' parliament-in-exile. Imad al-Alami, the representative 
in Damascus for the militant Hamas group, said armed struggle against 
Israel must continue and the charter should remain in force. Both 
Jibril's and Habash's groups are factions of Arafat's Palestine Liberation 
Organization. Hamas and the Jihad group, which also attended Sunday's 
meeting, are outside the PLO. Israel wants Arafat to call for a meeting 
of the Palestinian National Council to ask its members to annul the 
charter's provisions. It maintains Arafat promised to do so in the 
Wye accords signed last month in Washington, but Arafat maintains 
that already was done at a meeting of the council in the Gaza Strip 
in April 1996 and no further action is necessary. Members of Arafat's 
Fatah organization, the PLO's mainstream faction, dominate the council. 
But the Syria-based groups may be able to head off any charter change 
by denying Arafat a quorum for the meeting.
