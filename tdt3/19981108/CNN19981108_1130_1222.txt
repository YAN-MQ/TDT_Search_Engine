Ohio state's national championship hopes and number one ranking are 
history. Michigan state came from behind in Columbus to knock off 
the buckeyes, 28-24. Renaldo hill picked off Joe germaine as Ohio 
state looked for the dramatic last-minute win. UCLA remains perfect 
this season -- barely. Cade McNown's 61-yard td pass in the final 
30 seconds snapped a 34-34 tie with Oregon state. The Bruins take 
it, 41-34. Kansas state is 9-0. Michael Bishop threw for two scores 
and ran for another. The Wildcats pounded Baylor, 49-6. Don't forget 
about Tennessee. The Vols cruised to a 37-13 win over Alabama-Birmingham, 
improving to 8-0, becoming the first SEC team to win at least eight 
games in ten straight seasons.
