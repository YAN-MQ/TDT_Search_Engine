Four years after a class of fervent, conservative anti-politicians 
rode into the House majority with Newt Gingrich, many members of the 
radical Republican class of '94 are throwing their support behind 
Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., a signal that they are ready for more 
pragmatic leadership. Their backing marks a significant shift in emphasis. 
For although Livingston considers himself a staunch conservative, 
his ascension as the front-runner in the speaker's race in many ways 
represents the demise of anti-establishment impulses in the House. 
The question, of course, is whether any Republican will be able to 
manage the House with only a razor-thin six-vote majority. Even this 
past year, when the Republicans had five additional votes, they were 
paralyzed in trying to balance between social conservatives and the 
party's business wing, between fiscal conservatives and moderates. 
But Livingston, a 21-year veteran of the House who rose to chairman 
of the all-important Appropriations Committee, has shown he may not 
feel the same needs as Gingrich to placate his party's most raucously 
ideological wing. As Appropriations Committee chairman, he has been 
a vociferous critic of the attempts by conservatives to attach controversial 
riders to spending bills as a method to force through their social 
policies. And he is openly running as the kind of mainstream, deal-making, 
pragmatic politician that the conservative rebels once might have 
abhorred. On ABC's ``This Week'' Sunday, Livingston pre-emptively 
challenged the conservative commentator George Will, anticipating 
questions before they were asked and showing impatience with calls 
for ideological purity. ``Our forefathers wrote a Constitution that 
gave us the opportunity to settle our differences by compromise,'' 
Livingston said. ``Not by dictate. If I were George Will, I could 
say how the world should be run. But unfortunately, with a margin 
of only six votes in this coming Congress, I've got to work with people 
who don't believe the same way I do.'' Gingrich always had mixed loyalties. 
He too had once been a backbencher who fought the party establishment, 
so he at least understood the fervor of the rebel class. But in the 
last few weeks before he decided to step down, he railed against the 
very conservatives he brought into power. He denounced them on the 
House floor as the ``perfectionist caucus'' and he spoke bitterly 
of ``cannibalism'' in the party as he announced that he would resign. 
Already, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a class of '94 member who is 
head of the House's conservative caucus, which has 40 or more members, 
is openly crusading against Livingston. He calls the Louisiana Republican 
``an old-style pork caucus kind of guy'' who would lead House Republicans 
back into the minority. But Livingston has also been getting some 
surprising support from others among the one-time rebels. Rep. Lindsey 
Graham, R-S.C., one of the firebrands who tried to topple Gingrich 
in 1997, has come out unequivocally for Livingston, as have a number 
of other members of his class. Graham, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press'' Sunday, spoke admiringly of Livingston's courage in taking 
on Gingrich, and forcing him to step down. ``Bob Livingston has told 
me to my face I was full of it a couple of times and nobody else has 
done that,'' Graham said.``And I admire and respect that.''
