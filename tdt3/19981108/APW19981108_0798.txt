Summer Erb scored 29 points as North Carolina State used 56 percent 
field-goal shooting in the second half Sunday to pull away from Tapiolan 
Honka of Finland for a 95-73 exhibition women's basketball victory. 
Erb made 12 of 16 shots from the floor for the game to lead all scorers, 
while Tynesha Lewis added 16 points and Kim Smith 14 for the Wolfpack. 
The Finnish squad, playing its second game in less than 24 hours following 
a Saturday night loss to North Carolina, trailed by only five points 
at 61-56 with 12:22 remaining but would get no closer. N.C. State 
put the game away when Lewis hit a 3-pointer to 81-66 with 5:18 to 
go. Kirsten McCory scored 25 points while Anja Hellman added 24 on 
12-of-12 shooting from the line for Tapiolan Honka. N.C. State shot 
53 percent (37 of 70) for the game and outrebounded the Finns 40-30.
