Walter George Berl, a chemist whose research included high-energy 
ram-jet fuels and international firefighting programs, died on Oct. 
24 while vacationing in Durango, Colo. He was 81 and lived in Bethesda, 
Md. The cause was heart failure, said a spokesman for Johns Hopkins 
University. Berl retired in 1994 from the university's Applied Physics 
Laboratory in Laurel, Md. Berl, who edited a number of technical publications 
in his field, was born in Vienna. He earned a bachelor's degree in 
chemical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 
1937, a master's degree in chemistry at Harvard University in 1939 
and a doctorate in physical chemistry from what is now Carnegie Mellon 
University in 1941. Berl conducted research and taught at Carnegie 
Mellon until 1945, when he joined the staff of the Applied Physics 
Laboratory. In 1956 he was appointed to the principal professional 
staff, the institution's highest staff designation. He oversaw a program 
examining how fire starts and progresses, and studied energy-related 
combustion phenomena. His expertise helped to plan strategy for extinguishing 
oil well fires in Kuwait after the Persian Gulf War. Berl was the 
author of numerous articles, a consultant to the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission and editor-in-chief of the Johns Hopkins Applied Technology 
Digest. He held patents for a catalytic igniter for ram-jets and a 
method for bonding oxidizer particles in the manufacture of explosives. 
Berl is survived by his wife, Shirley Anne Hargraves; a daughter, 
Kathleen Victorino of Bethesda; a brother, Herbert of Washington; 
a stepdaughter, Cynthia Tobin of Blue Hill, Maine, and a stepson, 
Richard Hargraves of Durango, Colo. His earlier marriage to Ruth Gilman 
ended in divorce.
