Wondering why you've been seeing so much fun and strange stuff on 
TV these days? It's the November sweeps ratings period. Paul Vercammen 
reports. When the members of stomp step into "mad about you" -- And 
wynonna Judd shows up on the 100th episode of "touched by an angel" 
-- plus Chris Ter reeve, it can only be television's November ratings 
period -- sweeps. Sweeps is where you put on the 500-pound baby and, 
you know, teenage prostitutes and the whole stripper thing. So, look 
for roseanne to harmonize with Coolio this month. Those were the days! 
The math is simple for television stations -- rack up huge numbers 
during sweeps. And that adds up to charging higher advertising rates. 
And apparently, this time, the programmers think music lures viewers. 
Upcoming -- Garth Brooks and Celine Dion specials. Hanson stops by 
on "buddy faro." The temptations miniseries already unfolded to high 
ratings. Kiss appeared on "mad TV," "millennium" and "in concert." 
Yes, rock and roll every night. But unlike some sweeps periods gone 
by, nothing too radical. No major guest stars for many shows. Take 
ABC's "cupid," just trying to build an audience. This show is such 
an underdog. We're just a group of folks in Chicago putting the show 
out, and we don't have a whole lot of star turns on our side. You 
will get brothers Ben and Fred savage joining up on "boy meets world." 
Husband and wife Alec Baldwin D Kim Basinger on "the simpsons" and 
family talk on "the nanny." Fran might be getting pregnant, so that's 
sort of the plot line through the month. And "the love boat" cast 
just reunited for sweeps. Is this something to be excited about? I 
don't know. And I'm sure the networks aren't really excited about 
this sweeps period either. They might tell you they are, but they 
are not. Those execs will tell you the November ratings numbers mean 
the most for affiliates. Sweeps are more important to stations than 
to networks. You know, I think there is far too much emphasis put 
on them, because to be measured by one month seems sort of silly. 
Nonetheless, madness reigns in November. No matter if this sweeps 
period is toned down and tuned in. Here I am Paul Vercammen, "CNN 
Entertainment News," Hollywood.
