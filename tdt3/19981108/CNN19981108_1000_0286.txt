A published report this morning suggests the United States is getting 
so fed up with Saddam Hussein that it's ready to abandon using U.N. 
weapons inspectors to restrain him in favor of sanctions and the use 
of force. "The New York Times" quotes a "senior U.S. official" as 
the source for the information. But an administration official says 
the U.S. fully supports the weapons inspectors' work. Today, President 
Clinton will meet with his national security team at camp david to 
discuss Iraq's latest refusal to cooperate with the inspectors. A 
member of the council on foreign relations offers a solution. The 
appropriate response is not to let UNSCOM and the U.N. be jerked around 
any longer by Baghdad. And that this may be the end of the road for 
UNSCOM, there are things at stake beyond Iraq and U.N. relations. 
There's a whole anti-proliferation program at stake. With little to 
do, weapons inspectors are beginning to leave Iraq. A group of 15 
flew to Bahrain yesterday, and the U.N. says more will follow.
