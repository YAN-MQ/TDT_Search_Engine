Up next, why the world is awash -- in cognac. Something powerful is 
happening. It's the truck. And it's here. Introducing the new silvero. 
's bigger. It's more powerful. It's the truck ... from Chevrolet. 
Like a rock oh, like a rock. Gimme an "S" ! "S" ! gimme a "C" ! "c" 
! Unlike ordinary pickles, claussen just won't bend... other "C" ! 
"C"-- when it comes to taste. We make 'em cold and keep 'em cold. 
- enjoy the cold snap of claussen.
