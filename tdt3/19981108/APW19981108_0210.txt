The government said Sunday it has arrested eight people, including 
two Taiwanese, and smashed an international syndicate that was smuggling 
mainland Chinese to Canada via Japan. The territory's Independent 
Commission Against Corruption said the syndicate, which also forged 
passports, operated in Hong Kong with the assistance of some corrupt 
airline employees who switched boarding passes to help the smuggled 
people on their journeys. Among those arrested Saturday were three 
Hong Kong Chinese and three mainland Chinese who had arrived in the 
territory as visitors, it said. Commission officers detained one of 
the Taiwanese at Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport as he was escorting 
a Chinese to board a plane, the commission said. The Chinese visitor 
was believed to have had her boarding pass for a flight to the Chinese 
city of Shanghai exchanged for one for a flight to Japan, it added 
in a statement said. It said the syndicate was believed to be charging 
each Canada-bound Chinese U.S. dlrs 26,000 in the smuggling operation.
