The Prince of Wales laid a wreath of poppies and chrysanthemums in 
a Skopje graveyard Sunday in a tribute to British solders fallen in 
the Balkan battlefields of World War One. Prince Charles arrived in 
this southern Balkan nation of two million Sunday, the last stop of 
his four-nation, eight-day tour in Eastern Europe. The half-hour ceremony 
in a suburban Skopje graveyard Sunday, where 120 British soldiers 
are buried, was led by a British army chaplain and a Macedonian Orthodox 
priest. After laying the wreath for the fallen British soldiers, the 
prince left the capital to tour 15th and 16th century Orthodox churches 
in southern Macedonia. The prince, who didn't speak to the public 
Sunday, is accompanied by an entourage of British investors and diplomats. 
Also Sunday afternoon, the prince was briefed at the Skopje office 
of the British Broadcasting Corporation on relations between native 
Macedonians and the country's ethnic Albanian minority, who make up 
about 23 percent of the total population. Macedonia has remained peaceful 
in the last eight months, while armed ethnic Albanian guerrillas in 
neighboring Yugoslavia fight for independence of Kosovo province. 
Prince Charles is scheduled to dine Sunday evening with Macedonian 
President Kiro Gligorov. On Monday, he will visit the internationally 
respected Macedonian Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology, 
which was formed with Japanese help after a 1963 earthquake killed 
1,071 Skopje residents and damaged 70 percent of the city's buildings. 
He's also scheduled to attend a ceremony to grant loans by the British 
government to small and medium-sized businesses in Macedonia.
