What happened to ``Beloved''? The film adaptation of the Toni Morrison 
best seller about slavery was one of the most lavishly advertised 
films of the fall and received generally respectful reviews. Its star 
and producer is one of the most popular figures in America, Oprah 
Winfrey, who aggressively promoted the movie on her talk show and 
in numerous newspaper, magazine and television interviews. So did 
Jonathan Demme, the Academy Award winning director and one of the 
most respected filmmakers in Hollywood. And yet the film has grossed 
only about $21.2 million, less even than many of those who predicted 
tough box-office sledding had foreseen. It is expected to fade at 
the box office in the face of competition from forthcoming holiday 
movies. Walt Disney Co. is estimated to have spent as much as $75 
million to $80 million to produce and market the film. ``All there 
is is pain,'' Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said of the 
film's weak showing. ``You try to do something good, artistic, adult. 
It's like barking in the wind. It's the rare serious movie that gets 
the moviegoing audience these days.'' He added, ``I feel badly for 
Jonathan and Oprah.'' (Roth was enduring far less pain over Disney's 
newest film, ``The Water Boy,'' the Adam Sandler comedy, which grossed 
about $39.1 million in its first weekend. Several rival distribution 
executives termed the figure extraordinary.) ``Beloved,'' a three-hour 
adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Ms. Morrison, a 
Nobel laureate, deals with a runaway slave in rural Ohio named Sethe 
(Ms. Winfrey) who struggles to overcome the devastation and violence 
of a life that has haunted her. The drama includes some harrowing 
scenes depicting the brutalities of slavery. Although Disney had been 
uncertain about the commercial prospects for the film, the low box 
office came as a shock to executives not only at Disney but at rival 
studios. ``Beloved'' had been seen as almost a test case of whether 
an expensive and serious film that dealt with the black experience 
would appeal to mainstream audiences. The box office results will 
almost certainly make it even more difficult for filmmakers to find 
studio support for large-budget movies involving racial themes, many 
longtime movie executives said. Martin Grove, a box office analyst 
on CNN and a columnist at The Hollywood Reporter, said that the audience 
for ``Beloved'' has been consisting mostly of readers of the Morrison 
novel and fans of Ms. Winfrey. ``I don't believe there was any crossover 
audience,'' Grove said. ``Disney brought in the core audience initially. 
But after that it was up to the movie. And the problem seems to be 
that when a movie is three hours long, and word of mouth says that 
it's depressing and brutal, most people would rather do something 
else.'' Several distribution executives at rival studios said the 
film's appeal to black audiences seemed limited. Younger black audiences 
did not show up in large numbers for the movie, whose attendance drew 
heavily from black women over 30, the executives said. One distribution 
executive said that in its second week, the film dropped sharply among 
African-Americans, a big disappointment to Disney. He said that the 
film was now playing in mostly upscale theaters, catering to white 
as well as black audiences, and was performing poorly at suburban 
malls. Demme said he was hopeful that the film would slowly attract 
more customers and endure for a long time. ``The movie is struggling, 
but it also has a foothold,'' he said. ``I still utterly believe that 
it will hang in there and we'll see growth over the next several months,'' 
he added. ``People are going. There's positive word of mouth.'' But 
Demme said ``Beloved'' faced plenty of hurdles. ``The odds are stacked 
against it,'' he said. ``It's a difficult picture. The material is 
demanding. You have the length of the picture, too. There are fewer 
show times.'' He added, ``The big surprise for me is how prematurely 
the death of the movie has been foretold.'' Box office analysts and 
studio executives said, however, that the prospects for ``Beloved'' 
were bleak. Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, 
which monitors box office receipts, said: ``The film was tough going 
for a lot of audiences. Disney did a first-rate job marketing the 
film. The problem is word of mouth really hurt the film. There's no 
amount of marketing that can overcome negative word of mouth. And 
the word of mouth was that it was grim and hard to follow.'' This 
was underscored by conversations with theater owners. Michael Patrick, 
president of Carmike Cinemas, based in Columbus, Ga., one of the largest 
exhibitors in the nation, mostly in medium-size and smaller cities, 
said he had expected ``Beloved'' to open far more strongly. He said 
there seemed to be intense interest in the movie among filmgoers before 
it opened: the signs included phone calls to theaters asking when 
the film would be unveiled and what times it would be playing. ``All 
my computers will not tell me what happened and why it opened at a 
third of what we expected,'' said Patrick. ``Then I thought it would 
hold extremely well in its second weekend, even if it didn't open 
well. It didn't. We thought it would do better.'' Newspaper and magazine 
reviews for the film were generally respectful and often positive 
but failed to have an impact. Several rival studio executives said 
a risky and difficult-to-sell film like ``Beloved'' needed superlative 
reviews that essentially told moviegoers that they must see the film. 
By and large, the reviews in large-circulation newspapers and magazines 
did not quite carry that message. Moreover, the reviews may have unintentionally 
hurt the film because many of them cited the movie's length, its supernatural 
elements and its grimness. ``There are some classic word-of-mouth 
movies that succeed like `There's Something About Mary,' where people 
tell each other that you have to see it,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, an 
analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, a media research and consulting 
company. ``Then there are movies where people say, `I saw it and hated 
it' and `Don't waste your time.' And then there's movies that no one 
really talks about. And `Beloved' is sort of in that category. It 
hasn't generated any heat.'' Disney executives said they believed 
that if ``Beloved'' was nominated for an Academy Award or two early 
next year, which is probable, the film could generate some additional 
revenue on video sales.
