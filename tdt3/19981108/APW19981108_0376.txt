President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly returned to Moscow late Sunday, 
nearly a week before he was scheduled to end his medically mandated 
vacation in the southern resort town of Sochi, his press service said. 
Kremlin spokeswoman Vera Barysheva declined to comment on Yeltsin's 
condition, or why the president had come back earlier than expected. 
When Yeltsin went to Sochi on Oct. 30, just over a week ago, the Kremlin 
had said he would be there two weeks, recuperating from exhaustion. 
In recent months, the 67-year-old Yeltsin has steadily receded from 
public view, taking frequent vacations and periodically checking into 
government rest homes or sanitariums. He has been described as suffering 
from nothing worse than bad colds or, in the latest case, exhaustion. 
Public skepticism is growing, and Communists in the lower house of 
parliament _ who had first-hand experience hiding leaders' ailments 
in the Soviet period _ have begun to demand a full accounting of his 
physical condition. Russia's Supreme Court ruled last week that Yeltsin 
cannot seek a third term in office, ensuring that he is nearing the 
end of his political career. His term expires in 2000. In recent weeks, 
Yeltsin has ceded much of his day-to-day authority to Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov.
