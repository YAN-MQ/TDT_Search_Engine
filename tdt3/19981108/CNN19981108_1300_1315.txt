The first of several college football polls is out, and it comes as 
no surprise that there's a major shakeup. The buckeyes' loss to Michigan 
state dropped them all the way to seventh in the new coaches' poll 
released today. UCLA is in third, with Kansas state and Tennessee 
tied for the lead with the same number of points, although K-state 
had 30 first place votes, compared to 25 for the Vols.
