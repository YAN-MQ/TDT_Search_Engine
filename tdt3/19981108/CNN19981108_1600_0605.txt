Stress is something many people try to avoid in life. But as we get 
older, researchers have found a certain kind of stress can keep bones 
strong. Holly Firfer explains. 60-year-old Mary ornelia knows she's 
at high risk of developing osteoporosis -- one of 17 million people 
threatened by brittle bones disease. And researchers in Arizona predict 
that number could double by the year 2030. You're going to hold it 
or a count every 20. Relax. Researchers at the University of Arizona 
are looking for new ways to increase bone density in women. Early 
results show that combining strength training with hormone replacement 
therapy and calcium supplements helps to strengthen the bone. Our 
exercise training program is a rigorous resistance exercise program 
with weight bearing aerobic activity combined with exercises for strength 
and balance. I was having hip pain, and went for X-Rays and all of 
this, and now for 2 1/2 years, I haven't been bothered at all. More 
than 300 postmenopausal women have been following a weight training 
routine for three years -- lifting weights, doing weight resistance 
exercise and even wearing weighted vests -- to put stress on the muscles 
and tissue that are attached to the bone. There is some theory that 
it is not how much weight you expect the bone to be able to carry 
or resist, or how fast or slow you put that resistance to the bone, 
but doing them in different ways. And the terminology is if you can 
surprise the bone in the way you load it, that may be a way to continue 
to stimulate more bone mineralization and bone strengthening. Estrogen 
is a hormone that helps increase calcium absorption. After menopause, 
estrogen levels drop, so many women take hormone replacements. The 
new research shows adding vigorous strength training plus 800 milligrams 
of calcium daily can protect and even replenish bone minerals, and 
hopefully, prevent bone fractures as people age. Those fractures cost 
at least $10 billion each year in medical care, and could climb to 
$62 billion 20 years from now, doubling again in another two decades, 
if something's not done to protect aging bones. Holly Firfer, CNN,
