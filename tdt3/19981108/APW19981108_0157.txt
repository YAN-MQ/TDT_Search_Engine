Russia's Communist Party is causing the country to splinter and should 
be banned, a prominent and controversial businessman said Sunday. 
Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky criticized the Communists 
for their continued support of parliament deputy Albert Makashov, 
a Communist who received only a light reprimand from his party after 
making anti-Semitic remarks last month. ``As was the case with the 
Soviet Union, which split into ethnic entities, the Communists are 
now causing the Russian Federation to split into ethnic entities,'' 
Berezovsky said, according to the Interfax news agency. Some Communist 
speakers at Saturday rallies celebrating the 81st anniversary of Russia's 
revolution said Makashov was a hero who was unfairly vilified by other 
politicians and the press for his remarks. ``By expressing their solidarity 
with Makashov at a rally in Moscow on Nov. 7, the Communists placed 
themselves outside civilized laws and outside Russian laws,'' said 
Berezovsky, who is of Jewish origins. Berezovsky, who heads the Commonwealth 
of Independent States, a loose coalition of former Soviet republics, 
also said that the Communist Party was to blame for the collapse of 
the Soviet Union and ``must be immediately banned in Russia.'' The 
Communists are the country's leading opposition group and have the 
largest faction in parliament's lower house, the State Duma. The Communists 
have frequently criticized Russia's business ``oligarchs,'' including 
Berezovsky, saying they have taken control of large chunks of the 
economy through corrupt, insider deals. The businessmen in turn have 
been critical of the Communists, saying they are determined to keep 
economic control in state hands.
