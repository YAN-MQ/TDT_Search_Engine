European soccer officials on Sunday expelled Italian league leader 
Fiorentina from this season's UEFA Cup for the explosion last week 
that injured a match official and caused the suspension of a UEFA 
Cup game against Grasshoppers. The decision means that the Swiss team 
will advance to the third round, facing Bordeaux. UEFA's Control and 
Disciplinary Commission said the punishment would have been more severe 
if there had not been mitigating circumstances. Fiorentina announced 
it would appeal.
