As Joanne Woodward talked about her favorite book, Willa Cather's 
``Lucy Gayheart,'' it was as if she were directing a movie based on 
the novella. It was winter in the small Midwestern town, Cather wrote, 
and the Platte River was frozen. In a wide shot, Ms. Woodward could 
see her heroine skating, with, in the author's words, ``the two ends 
of a long crimson scarf ... floating on the wind behind her, like 
two slender crimson wings.'' Lucy's perpetual suitor, Harry Gordon, 
arrives, and she takes his arm. Then they cross hands and dance away, 
breaking free of the skating party. The camera remains at a distance, 
recording the idyllic panorama. Ms. Woodward gradually moved her hands 
closer together until Lucy's lovely face filled the imaginary screen. 
``If I was shooting this,'' she said, ``it would never be in close-up 
until Lucy is on the train to Chicago. Then you begin the journey.'' 
The train takes Lucy back to her work as a piano student and teacher, 
and that leads to her meeting with the celebrated concert singer Clement 
Sebastian, a man who will forever change her life. At least once a 
year, Ms. Woodward rereads and savors the story, one of Cather's least-known 
and most memorable books. For years, Ms. Woodward has dreamed about 
turning it into a movie. As a first step in bringing ``Lucy Gayheart'' 
to a wider public, she was preparing to read it aloud for an audience 
at Symphony Space: the entire book, in two parts in two evenings, 
concluding Monday night. Ms. Woodward is the first actress in a series 
entitled ``Singular Women,'' to be followed by Claire Bloom with ``Enter 
the Actress'' and Vanessa Redgrave reading from ``Mrs. Dalloway.'' 
Ms. Woodward said she was unsure how she first came across the book 
but thought that Gore Vidal introduced it to her many years ago. She 
was immediately drawn to the character of Lucy, the golden girl of 
her community, and to the story of a tragic love. ``Somewhere it strikes 
a very deep chord in me,'' Ms. Woodward said. ``I have no idea why, 
except that it is so intensely romantic,'' despite the fact the romance 
is never consummated. ``It has a sense of longing, a desire to go 
someplace else, which was a part of me as a child.'' She opened her 
paperback copy and read the description of the first time Sebastian 
embraced Lucy: ``Before she had time to speak, just as she was, in 
her hat and coat, he took her in his arms. They stood for a long while 
without moving, in the dusky little hall among overcoats and walking-sticks.'' 
Ms. Woodward said: ``It's highly sensual, partly because Lucy is very 
young, and he's much older.'' Speaking about the movie in her mind 
(and perhaps in her future), she added, ``Placido Domingo was born 
to play the role.'' Naturally, she would discover a new young actress 
to play Lucy. Partly the book is about the tricks that life plays 
on people, the accidents that become turning points. ``It's interesting 
to think about Willa Cather,'' Ms. Woodward said. ``What brought this 
out? Was it a loss on her part? It doesn't happen in her other books. 
This was much later, in 1935. The older we get, we begin to think 
about things we didn't think about when we were young. Everything 
begins to iris in.'' Lucy reminds her of the golden girls of her own 
youth. She remembered one in particular, a classmate at Louisiana 
State University, who was crowned queen of the school in both her 
freshman and sophomore years. ``She had the most radiant smile,'' 
she said. ``A light somehow glimmered around her. When I think of 
casting, I think of her.'' Ms. Woodward was a member of the queen's 
court: ``I was the dark neurotic one wearing black sweaters and rather 
pretentiously carrying around a copy of `Ulysses.''' After two years, 
she left LSU and moved to New York to become an actress. Her classmate? 
``I've often wondered what happened to her. Probably she married a 
younger version of some good ol' boy. I would hate to think that, 
because she had so much more.'' And if Lucy had married her suitor, 
Harry? ``She might have been frozen in time,'' and would never have 
had that transforming experience. Asked if there was a Sebastian, 
``a big singer,'' in her own past, Ms. Woodward admitted to having 
had a crush on Ezio Pinza, who was starring in ``South Pacific'' when 
she arrived in New York. She bought a standing-room ticket to see 
him in the musical and ``used to haunt the Astor Pharmacy'' to get 
a glimpse of him on the way to the theater. ``Ah, heaven,'' she said, 
``if only I could have played the piano.'' As an understudy in William 
Inge's ``Picnic,'' she met, and later married, Paul Newman. Then she 
went to Hollywood to act in ``Count Three and Pray,'' a Civil War 
western, ``a joyous time,'' to be followed by some less than happy 
experiences. ``Making films is like brain surgery,'' she said. ``It's 
scary. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.'' Among those that worked 
were ``Three Faces of Eve,'' ``Rachel, Rachel'' and ``Mr. and Mrs. 
Bridge.'' In recent years, she has turned down movie offers. ``I keep 
getting scripts in which people say, `We would like you to consider 
the role of grandma,' '' she said. ``I think: `Wait a minute, I don't 
have to play that. I am somebody's grandma.''' Occasionally, she acts 
on the stage, and increasingly she has worked as a director, specializing 
in plays by Clifford Odets (``Golden Boy,'' ``Waiting for Lefty'') 
and working with young actors at the Blue Light Theater Company and 
the Williamstown Theater Festival. Currently she is directing a workshop 
of ``Dark of the Moon,'' a Broadway hit in 1945. She also went back 
to school, studying at Sarah Lawrence College. ``I started college 
in 1947,'' she said, ``and I graduated in 1990, making me by a long 
shot the oldest living undergraduate.'' Always a great reader, she 
took a tentative step onstage in May with a short story at Symphony 
Space. With ``Lucy Gayheart,'' she occupies the stage for two full 
evenings. Last Monday, she began her reading, working her way through 
the lyrical Cather landscape and standing in for all the characters. 
Afterward, Isaiah Sheffer, the artistic director of Symphony Space, 
invited the audience to return Monday night to hear the conclusion 
of the story and to find out if Lucy Gayheart lives happily ever after. 
Those who have read the story know otherwise, and look forward to 
the magical closing words. When Lucy was 13, she left her footprints 
in the newly paved sidewalk outside her home, where they remained 
locked in time, in Cather's words, ``three light footprints, running 
away.'' Should Ms. Woodward film ``Lucy Gayheart,'' that would, of 
course, be the final poignant image.
