Tommy Flowers, a British electronics engineer who developed a vast, 
pioneering computer that cracked German military communications in 
World War II, has died. He was 92. Flowers' son Kenneth said Sunday 
that his father died from heart failure at home in London on Oct. 
28. An engineering graduate of the University of London, Flowers joined 
the British Post Office, then responsible for all national communications, 
in the 30s and experimented in electronic telephone transmissions. 
In World War II, Flowers was sent to Bletchley Park, 50 miles (80 
kms) from London where mathematicians, cryptographers and other experts 
worked on breaking Germany military codes. Flowers secretly developed 
Colossus, a one-ton machine that revolutionized the first part of 
decoding by pinpointing wheel setting used by German operators for 
coded messages. The Germans were using a then-sophisticated machine 
known as Lorenz. ``Colossus had all the characteristics of the computer 
although it wasn't thought of as a computer at the time,'' Kenneth 
Flowers said in a telephone interview. ``It could think and made decisions. 
Up to then these machines had been used just to make numerical calculations.'' 
Flowers' breakthrough lay in devising an electronic machine to do 
what had previously been done mechanically, his son said. By the D-Day 
invasion of June 1944 Flowers had produced one more Colossus which 
worked five times as fast as his original one. By the end of the war 
in 1945, 10 machines were in operation. Flowers received an honor, 
Member of the British Empire, for his work in the 40s, but remained 
largely unknown to the wider public because the work was kept secret 
until the 70s. Bletchley Park is now a tourist attraction with the 
German's Lorenz machines on display and a replica of the Colossus, 
which Flowers saw switched on by the Duke of Kent, a cousin of Queen 
Elizabeth II, on June 6,1996. Flowers is survived by his wife, Eileen, 
sons Kenneth and John, and three grandchildren. The funeral will be 
held Monday at Hendon Crematorium in north London.
