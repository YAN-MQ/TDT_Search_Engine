When the University of Maryland's College of Journalism decided to, 
in the words of its dean, Reese Cleghorn, create ``more of a journalism 
with a capital `J' program,'' the public relations division of the 
program was sent packing. The move was a sharp departure for the journalism 
school, which, like most others throughout the country, had lumped 
journalism education with advertising and public relations under the 
rubric of mass communications. (The school's advertising program is 
being phased out entirely, due to a separate, budget-related decision.) 
Last spring, faculty members of the College of Journalism voted, 10-9, 
with two abstentions, to eliminate public relations. But after a summer 
of intense negotiations by the division's two professors, James Grunig 
and Larissa Grunig, a husband-and-wife team, public relations found 
a new home within the university, at the College of Arts and Humanities. 
Next fall it will become part of a newly organized communications 
department there. Discussing the change, Cleghorn said the academic 
connection between public relations and journalism stemmed from the 
often close working relationship between members of both professions. 
That relationship, he said, was essentially a marriage of convenience 
that took place many years ago, when journalism and public relations 
programs sprouted up at universities throughout the country. But he 
does not believe that the two fields require the same skills or have 
the same professional ideals. ``A journalist's mission is to tell 
the truth,'' Cleghorn said. ``It's not to sell something, it's not 
to sell people on something _ it's to find out and disseminate the 
truth in a responsible manner.'' Toward that end, he said, ``We should 
be able to deal with the complex questions that arise from that particular 
mission all the way through our curriculum.'' And so, instead of giving 
students four majors to choose from _ news editorial, broadcast, advertising 
and public relations _ the school will now have a single curriculum 
that includes courses on ethics and the history of journalism. In 
addition, Cleghorn said, better-qualified students will be sought. 
James Grunig said he was looking forward to the move to the College 
of Arts and Humanities. He complained that the public relations program, 
in which he and his wife were the only full-time faculty members last 
year for 239 students (32 percent from the College of Journalism), 
never received the necessary resources from the College of Journalism. 
Now, two full-time faculty members along with additional graduate 
students will join the program to teach and advise undergraduates. 
Shannon Bowen, a doctoral candidate in public relations, said: ``I 
have no roots with journalism. We study completely different things 
than they do. They would be studying advanced public affairs reporting 
and we'd be studying strategic planning.'' ``We were kind of shunned,'' 
she added, ``and the only professors we had were the Grunigs. The 
new situation is going to be a lot better.''
