COUNTRY: Often called the Roof of the World, Tibet is more than twice 
the size of France, and has large deposits of gold, copper and radioactive 
ores. POPULATION: 2.4 million in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, which 
does not cover the whole of the Tibetan plateau. All told, there are 
7 million Tibetans in China. HISTORY: A powerful kingdom for centuries, 
Tibet was ruled by a Dalai Lama from the 17th century, but fell partly 
under Chinese sway from 1720 until 1911, when Tibetans reasserted 
their independence. After the Communists took power in China in 1949, 
Tibet became a ``national autonomous region'' of China in 1951. The 
Chinese suppressed a revolt in 1959, during which the current Dalai 
Lama escaped to India. In 1965, the Tibetan Autonomous Region was 
formally established. During the Cultural Revolution, thousands of 
Tibetan monasteries were destroyed. The ban on the Tibetans' religion 
was lifted in 1978, but they continue to chafe at Chinese rule.
