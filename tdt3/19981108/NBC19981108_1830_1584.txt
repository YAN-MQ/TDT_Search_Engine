Finally tonight, a custody case involving elephants. A court in south 
Africa could make a life or death digs. Kevin Tibbles reports. These 
30 young elephants are at the center of a custody battle that has 
gone all the way to the south African courts. Aged between 2 and 7, 
they were spirited out of neighboring Botswana to be tamed, and then 
sold to zoos and game parks. But animal welfare groups are divided 
on the technique used to train them. Some say the elephants are beaten, 
and that chaining their feet together is cruel. There is something 
very, very wrong going on in there, and there is definitely abuse 
of these elephants going on, cruelty like I have never seen in my 
life. The elephants' owner claims taming them actually saves them, 
otherwise they would be killed to combat overpopulation in drought-ridden 
botswana. He plans to sell them for $750,000. But this U.S.-based 
director of the humane society says saving them by taming them may 
do more harm than good. The conditions are worsening for some of these 
animals on a daily basis, to the point where they are going to become 
life-threatening. And maybe that won't help. The other thing that 
is going to happen, for those that survive is, that they will now 
face a life of absolute terror and panic because of the way they have 
been treated early on. One zoo in China and two in Germany have already 
expressed interest in purchasing these elephants, but animal rights 
groups hope the court decides to set them free. Kevin Tibbles, NBC 
news.
