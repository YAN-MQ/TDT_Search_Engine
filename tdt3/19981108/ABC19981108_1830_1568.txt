Finally tonight -- luxury items areupposed to be immune from economic 
UPS and Downs, but don't tell that to the makers of cognac. ABC's 
Sheila MacVicar explains why winemakersn France are suffing from the 
economic crisis in Asia. The people who make cognacall it, "the drink 
of the Angels." Heady, smooth, it is some of the most expensive liquor 
on the planet, the produ of the harvest of acres of specially grown 
grapes distilled into liquor that sleeps for years in Els untiit matures. 
Buas good as those who make cognac think it is, drinking it is a habithat 
has fallen at a fashion, and declines in sales now endanr an entire 
way of life. There is a crisis here because we have a very good product, 
but we cannot sell it at the right price. That's the crisis. Cognais 
awash in unsold cognac -- in the great warehouses already lie at least 
eight years' woh of unsold reserves. And make matters worse, the financial 
declines in Asia have meant the almost total collapse othe market 
there. In Hong Kong alone, sales are down by more than 40%. If you're 
concerned about tomorrow, maybe you don't drink as much -- as much 
cognac. This year, tons of cognac grapes were trucked away to make 
Lesser wines. Cognacmakers arerying to entice new customers with what 
once wou have been heresy -- cognac with ice, with tonic, in beer. 
And those who grow the grapes took to the streets last month to dand 
government help. More than 60% the small producers are now overextended 
the bank. With what E big cognac houses are willing to pay them,hey're 
not breaking even. And for many, that mns bankruptcy. We are all wondering, 
"how bad can it get and wh is this all going to stop?" We simply can't 
make it, and we're all frightened. All frightened because a waof life 
will change. A faer like kristoff rouseau may not be able to Lea to 
his grachildren the gift at was left for him -- cognac produced the 
yeahe was born. Sheila MacVicar, ABC News, cognac
