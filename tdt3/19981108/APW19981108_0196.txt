Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal on Sunday cautioned against 
a possible U.S. use of force against Iraq, saying that civilians could 
be harmed. But he also said that Iraq was responsible for the current 
crisis and urged Baghdad to rescind its decision to end cooperation 
with U.N. arms monitors. The United States and Britain have not ruled 
out using force to back up their demand that the weapons inspectors 
are allowed to resume their work. Egypt and Saudi Arabia ``are keen 
to see that the Iraqi people are not harmed,'' Prince Saud al-Faisal 
said after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. ``But the 
responsibility for this issue is entirely that of the Iraqi leadership.'' 
``We are dismayed that the work with the (U.N.) commission was stopped,'' 
he said. He called on Iraq to ``rescind its decision.'' Asked if Saudi 
Arabia would support a U.S. strike against Iraq, Prince Saud said: 
``There is no doubt we prefer a peaceful solution. Is there anyone 
who wants harm done to the Iraqi people?' Last week, U.S. Secretary 
of Defense William Cohen visited Saudi Arabia and was told that the 
kingdom would not allow its territory to be used for strikes against 
Iraq. On Friday, Cohen returned from a tour of Arab nations and Turkey, 
saying he was satisfied the United States would have adequate support 
from Arab nations for any action against Iraq. U.N. weapons inspectors 
are responsible for overseeing the elimination of Baghdad's weapons 
of mass destruction, a process Baghdad must complete before U.N. economic 
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
