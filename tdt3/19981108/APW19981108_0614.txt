An ethnic Albanian guerrilla on Sunday called the killings of five 
uniformed rebels by police a violation of Kosovo's cease-fire and 
Serb police spent a second day searching for two missing officers. 
The five died Friday on a road near Opterusa in central Kosovo. Police 
described the encounter as a shootout and said the uniformed Kosovo 
Liberation Army guerrillas fired first, and foreign observers reported 
a similar account. But Sebajdin Cena, who described himself as the 
KLA doctor at its regional headquarters in Retinje village, said police 
ambushed the two cars the rebels were driving and the KLA victims 
never fired a shot. Other KLA fighters exchanged gunfire with the 
police after the ambush, he said. ``There is no logic saying the KLA 
got out of the car and shot at an armored vehicle. The truth is that 
the police shot at them,'' Cena said. ``We consider it a violation 
of the cease-fire.'' The dead included Gjelal Hajda, 31, commander 
of two KLA brigades in the region, and his assistant, Selajdin Mullabazi, 
29, Cena said. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic 
in the Yugoslav federation. Ethnic Albanians make of 90 percent of 
Kosovo's population. Serb's began cracking down on ethnic Albanian 
separatists began in February. Since then, several hundred people 
have been killed and up to 300,000 driven from their homes. Cena said 
the international community ``should put more pressure on Serbs because 
the violence could spread.'' ``Whenever the police attack Albanian 
villages, we are not going to wait to tell them to go back. We are 
going to use force,'' he said. On the same day the Albanians were 
killed, two Serbian police officers, Dejan Djatlov, 23, and Ilija 
Vujosevic, 48, disappeared while distributing food to remote police 
checkpoints some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of province's 
capital Pristina, the Serb Media Center reported. The two may have 
been abducted by the KLA, possibly in retaliation for the killing 
of the guerrillas, Serb sources said. They are the latest of a few 
dozen Serb police officers to go missing since the crackdown started. 
Violence in predominately ethnic Albanian Kosovo flared anew this 
past week, despite the peace accord designed to end bloodshed in the 
turbulent province and set the stage for a political agreement between 
Serb authorities and ethnic Albanian leaders.
