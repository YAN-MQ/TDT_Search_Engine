There is a rather timely medical exhibit and conference going on in 
washington. The subject is the Tibetan art of healing. It coincides 
with the Dalai Lama's nine-day visit to the United States. Jonathan 
aiken reports. The art of the healing Buddha, a medical art, practiced 
in Tibet a century before Christ. It's the focus of a three-day international 
Congress of medical experts in washington. The guest of honor, the 
Dalai Lama, who noted the gathering wasn't the first of its kind. 
The first international conference on medicine took place in Tibet, 
eighth century -- eighth century! The conference is exploring ways 
western medicine with its reliance on technology and research can 
benefit from the Tibetan concept of the mind as a wellspring of all 
phenomena, both well and ill. Do you have -- how you say, a tingling 
or numbness in your feet? Very much, yes. Demonstrating their skills, 
Tibetan doctors met with several patients at George Washington University 
hospital. A detailed examination of a patient's pulse and urine, along 
with observation and intuition often yields a keenly accurate diagnosis 
of a Patient's illness or symptoms. The tingling in my feet -- it 
hasn't been anything that anyone has spoken about. In Tibetan medicine, 
the mind and body are one -- a holistic approach emphasizing behavior, 
diet and a patient's attitude as the keys to good living. As the Dalai 
Lama noted, a doctor's attitude counts for just as much. Showing a 
genuine sense of caring, sense of compassion, sense of concern. The 
conference is timely. After several years of detente, there's growing 
skepticism in western medical circles about the value of alternative 
treatments like Tibetan medicine. This meeting is looking for ways 
the two sciences cannot just coexist, but also complement each other. 
Prominent schools like Stanford and Duke already offer programs designed 
to integrate traditional and alternative approaches to medicine. The 
presence of the Dalai Lama at this conference adds weight to those 
who feel Tibetan medicine has something of value to offer the west.
