The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 9: One of 
the candidates in Kazakhstan's presidential elections in January claims 
to be clairvoyant, but anyone can predict that the winner will be 
the incumbent, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Nazarbayev is a thinly disguised 
dictator who stages elections he has no chance of losing. Few Western 
leaders complain, because he is seen as the guarantor of stability 
in an oil-rich nation. Nazarbayev was initially one of the more democratic 
of the Central Asian rulers, but since 1995 he has steadily expanded 
his powers. A compliant parliament recently passed constitutional 
amendments extending the presidential term from five years to seven 
and lifting term limits. Nazarbayev has been jailing political opponents 
on libel charges and last week kicked his leading opponent, former 
Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, off the ballot on a technicality. 
Nazarbayev has also been shutting down the country's few independent 
newspapers. Television is controlled by his daughter. American officials 
raise such issues with Nazarbayev when they visit, and call democratic 
development an important American goal in the region. But oil takes 
precedence, as Kazakhstan's proven oil reserves alone come to 10 billion 
barrels. Nazarbayev controls these contracts and provides stability 
in a region where fundamentalist Islam is growing. He has been received 
warmly by President Clinton. Kazakhstan's democratization is not a 
priority for Washington, and Nazarbayev knows it. This is not only 
wrong, but also shortsighted. The absence of accountability in Kazakhstan 
has allowed corruption to thrive. It is beginning to interfere with 
foreign investment, as officials have arbitrarily revoked or renegotiated 
contracts. Corruption is also helping to wreck the economy. Powerful 
businessmen have blocked needed economic reforms, such as bankruptcy 
laws. Kazakhstan cannot pay wages or pensions on time. No one expects 
Central Asia to become a haven of democracy overnight, but the region 
has built virtually no democratic political institutions under its 
current leaders. Nazarbayev's speeches promise fair elections and 
a free press. The West should hold him to this, starting with the 
restoration of Kazhegeldin's right to challenge him.
