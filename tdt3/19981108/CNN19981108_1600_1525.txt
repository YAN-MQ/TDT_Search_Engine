India is taking steps to understand its past -- its jurassic past. 
130 million years ago, parts of India were crawling with giant vegetarian 
dinosaurs with long skinny necks and tails. Each of these creatures, 
called kotasaurs, was more than 600 feet long. Now, scientists are 
using 800 bones from the remains of 11 different kotasaurs to assemble 
the best specimen possible. It will be topped with a fiberglass head 
donated by the Carnegie museum.
