This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" from later today through Monday. High pressure continues 
to be the main influence over the extreme eastern U.S., although there 
will be some clouds. A few rain or snow showers as well, especially 
over the lower Mississippi river valley, where we could see some showers 
or thunderstorms. And across the plains states, we'll see snow in 
the northern plains continuing through the rocky mountains, although 
a break does develop on monday in the far west. There could be some 
rain showers in the northwest. Highs today, 20s and 30s, the northern 
Rockies into the upper midwest. 40s for New England. 50s and 60s across 
much of the south. A little warmer over Florida, south Texas and in 
parts of the southwest. Looking ahead to Tuesday -- you see wet weather 
through all of the east, also some rain across the northwest. On Wednesday, 
showers in the west. Some of that'll be mountain snow, with wet weather 
moving into the northeast. Just 30s over the northern plains. And 
finally, Thursday, a mix of rain and snow over the northern Great 
Lakes and rain showers in the northwest. Don't forget, four-day forecasts, 
7,200 cities, CNN.com.
