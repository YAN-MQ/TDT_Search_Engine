Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, said Sunday that 
he was ``hurt and bewildered'' by his arrest in London, and he vowed 
to fight ``with all my spirit'' attempts to extradite him to Spain 
to stand trial. In a statement issued Sunday morning from the private 
clinic where he is recovering from back surgery, the 82-year-old general 
said: ``A show trial in Spain, a foreign land, is not justice. It 
is certainly not British justice.'' Pinochet was taken into custody 
on Oct. 16 in a surprise arrest by British police acting on an extradition 
request from a Spanish magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, who is investigating 
atrocities committed during the ``dirty wars'' in Latin America in 
the 1970s and 1980s. Garzon wants to bring charges of genocide, torture 
and terrorism against him in the loss of more than 3,000 lives in 
Chile and abroad. On Oct. 28, the High Court in London ruled that 
Pinochet enjoyed immunity from arrest and prosecution because he was 
a former head of state, but they ordered him to remain here under 
police guard while an appeal of that decision is argued. That appeal 
is now before the law lords of the House of Lords, England's highest 
court, and a third day of arguments is scheduled Monday, with a final 
decision on the general's liberty to leave Britain expected later 
in the week. Attorneys seeking a reversal of the High Court order 
argued last week that crimes against humanity historically were never 
protected by sovereign immunity and that some of the charges against 
Pinochet date to a military junta period in which he was not the head 
of state of Chile. In the statement Sunday, the first word from Pinochet 
since the episode began, he said that he was lying in his hospital 
bed when his wife told him of his arrest. ``She was in tears as she 
tried to speak,'' he said. ``I was hurt and bewildered.'' He said 
the peaceful future of countries that had experienced internal conflict 
lay in ``reconciliation,'' and he said that ``in Chile as elsewhere, 
recrimination is the enemy of reconciliation.'' He cited Spain, South 
Africa and Northern Ireland as positive examples where ``wide decisions 
have been made not to revisit the past.'' ``The opening up of old 
wounds, bringing back into debate issues where the true facts have 
long since been forgotten, serves no purpose,'' he said. In that connection, 
he said that reports of what took place in his own country had been 
``a travesty of the truth'' and that he as a result had become victimized 
by ``spurious attempts by foreign prosecutors to convict me on unproven 
charges.'' He said he was heartened by the support of the Chilean 
government but made no mention of the divided sentiments among the 
people of Chile over his fate. ``My fellow citizens have come to terms 
with our nation's past,'' he said. ``They are my true judges. That 
is why I shall fight this extradition request with all my spirit, 
supported by the president and government of my country. And God willing, 
I shall return home to Chile with my family where I hope to live the 
last years of my life in peace.'' He gave a version of Chile's recent 
history and his role in it at odds with that of his opponents who 
accuse him of the bloody overthrow of a democratically elected government 
and a systematic campaign of torture, kidnapping and murdering to 
keep himself in power. In 1973 under President Salvador Allende Gossens, 
he said, he took over the country because it was ``crippled'' by governmental 
chaos, and a Soviet-style insurrection was being planned. ``I have 
lived with my conscience and my own memories for over a quarter of 
a century since the events of 1973,'' he said. ``I wish things could 
have been different. I wish Allende had left of his own accord with 
the guarantees of safety I offered to him. In the end he chose not 
to take this course. Instead he chose suicide.'' He said, ``I am clear 
in my mind that the return to Chile of true democracy, and from that 
the true freedom to which all individual people are entitled could 
not have been achieved without the removal of the Marxist government.'' 
He conceded that many freedoms were lost ``for a brief period during 
the early 1970s.'' Then added: ``Yes, it took time to bring them back. 
But I regard it as my greatest achievement that these freedoms did 
indeed return.'' He said he was dismayed with Britain, a country he 
has always expressed fondness for and that he supported in the 1982 
Falkland Islands war with Argentina. ``I am saddened that the experience 
of my arrest has shaken my belief in Britain. Previously, I never 
doubted that Britain was a country where people may move about freely.'' 
The Spanish government backed Garzon's extradition action in a Cabinet 
vote Friday, provoking an angry response from Chile, which withdrew 
its ambassador to Madrid. The British government has said that the 
Pinochet case is a judicial one between magistrates in two European 
countries and that it therefore cannot act on requests from people 
like Margaret Thatcher to free the general and let him return home. 
Pinochet had tea in Thatcher's home shortly before his arrest.
