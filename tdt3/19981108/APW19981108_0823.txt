Italian league leader Fiorentina was kicked out of this season's European 
club competition Sunday in punishment for the explosion that injured 
a match official and caused the suspension of a UEFA Cup game last 
week. Fiorentina immediately announced it would appeal. If that fails, 
it will be Grasshoppers of Zurich that advance to the third round 
of the UEFA Cup against France's Bordeaux. ``Fiorentina was responsible 
for order and security both inside and around the stadium, before 
during and after the match and therefore liable for incidents of any 
kind,'' said UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Commission. ``Had there 
not been mitigating circumstances, Fiorentina AC would have been excluded 
from future UEFA club competitions as well,'' it said. Specifically 
it cited the fact that it was apparently a supporter of Fiorentina's 
Italian rival, Salernitana, who threw the device. The match was held 
at Salerno, near Naples in southern Italy. Fiorentina was leading 
2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play. Having won the first leg against 
the Swiss side 2-0, it expected easily to advance to the third round 
of the UEFA Cup. But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field 
official was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval. 
Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who helps the referee and linesmen, 
was taken to hospital with a right knee injury. Several players were 
temporarily deafened. The game was being played in Salerno because 
Fiorentina was paying the second and last round of suspension of its 
Franchi stadium as a result of fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners 
Cup game. UEFA said Fiorentina's previous bad record had been taken 
into account on deciding on the expulsion. Fiorentina and Salerno 
fans have a history of bitterness. But Fiorentina club wanted to raise 
funds for victims of recent flooding in southern Italy and so played 
at its rival's grounds. Italian papers reported that police questioned 
a local Salerno man who was a suspect. Luciano Luna, Fiorentina's 
administrator, said his club would appeal by the Wednesday midnight 
deadline. The appeal is likely to be heard next weekend. ``The bomb 
was aimed at Fiorentina, not against the referees and not against 
the Grasshoppers players,'' he said. Fiorentina coach Giovanni Trapattoni 
said: ``The fact that they did not place the objective responsibility 
on us makes us optimistic for the appeal.'' ``Let's hope that good 
sense prevails in the appeal,'' he said. ``Otherwise in an international 
tournament, any fan can go abroad to a game and influence the result 
with an act of violence like that at Salerno.'' ``We welcome the decision 
of UEFA and think it's a sensible decision given the circumstances,'' 
said Grasshoppers' president Romano Spadaro. ``We are looking forward 
to playing against Bordeaux,'' he said. The third round takes place 
Nov. 24 and Dec. 8. Bordeaux was pleased. ``Fiorentina is a top club 
and for us it will now be less difficult to advance to the next round,'' 
said Bordeaux assistant coach Marius Tresor, who was in Florence Sunday 
to scout the Italian team in case of a different UEFA decision. ``Ethically, 
though, Fiorentina deserves to stay in (the tournament).'' The UEFA 
Cup is the least lucrative of the three European club tournaments. 
But even so, it is still an important money-spinner for the clubs. 
Fiorentina is still on course for a place in next season's European 
Cup. It recovered its place at the top of the Italian league Sunday 
with a 4-1 win over last-place Venezia. Fiorentina had lost two of 
its last three games to fall from the top spot.
