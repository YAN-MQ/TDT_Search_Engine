After more than three decades, the Japanese baseball team, the baystars, 
are calling themselves winners once again. Chris riker reports, the 
team's recent victory also means good business for the city of yokohama. 
Kazuhiro sasaki and the baystars declawed the lions. It's yokohama's 
first Japan series title in 38 years. And the fans just can't get 
enough. She says, "they're cool!" And there are plenty of other fans 
who agree. The parade swept the baystars through a crowd of 400,000 
cheering fans. Confetti rained down, as the local heroes enjoyed their 
time in the sun. The baystars were known as the "whales," way back, 
in 1960. That's also the last time they were champions. In the years 
that followed, even their staunchest fans came to call them the "sinking 
whales." 1998 has changed everything. Now, the yokohama chamber of 
commerce says it expects the baystars to shine brightly -- drawing 
the city about 60 billion yen, or 520 million U.S. dollars in so-called 
"feel-good revenue." In any case, the baystars are the undisputed 
stars of yokohama. Chris riker, CNN.
