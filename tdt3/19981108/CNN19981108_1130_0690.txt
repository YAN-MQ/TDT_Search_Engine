The former leader of operation rescue has filed for bankruptcy. Anti-abortion 
activist Randall Terry says he did it because of the debts he owes 
women's groups and clinics that have successfully sued him. Terry 
has been ordered to pay a combined $1.6 million to the national organization 
for women and planned parenthood. And several other suits are still 
pending.
