The top stories are coming up next. And still ahead, in "Dollars & 
Sense" -- using laughter to deal with the economic crisis in Asia. 
Later -- unlocking the secrets of the past using the high-tech tools 
of today. Hello. Welcome to Dodge Durango 101. Today, I'll be covering 
th E 5.2 and 5.9 liter Magnum V-8's vis-A-vis durango's superiority 
in the class structure of domestic compact sport utility vehicles.
