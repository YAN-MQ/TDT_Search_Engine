Alexander Ostlund scored his only goal of the season Sunday as AIK 
Stockholm edged Orgryte 1-0 Sunday to clinch the Swedish League title. 
``Now I hope all our fans will forgive me for missing so many scoring 
opportunities this season,'' said Ostlund, a 20-year-old striker. 
His game-winner came five minutes into the second half before a crowd 
of 18,017 at Rasunda Stadium. AIK won its 10th championship and second 
in six years despite scoring the fewest goals _ 25 _ in the 14-team 
league, one goal less than last-placed Oster. Key players on the team 
included Anders Limpar, who was a member of Sweden's squad that finished 
third in the 1994 World Cup in the United States, and fellow midfielder 
Johan Mjallby, who helped Sweden beat England in a European qualifier 
in the same stadium earlier this fall. Mjallby is expected to join 
a foreign team soon. ``(Glasgow) Celtic leads the race,'' Mjallby 
said. Helsingborgs IF, which lost 2-1 at Hacken, finished two points 
behind AIK. Third place went to another Stockholm side, Hammarby, 
a further two points behind. Former two-time UEFA Cup champion IFK 
Goteborg, tipped as a major contender for the championship, had a 
nightmare season and finished eighth. Arild Stavrum, Helsingborg's 
Norwegian striker, won the scoring title with 18 goals in 24 games.
