In April, after a well-publicized wave of protests against the lewd 
language and fisticuffs on ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' its owner, 
Studios USA, announced that it would eliminate all physical violence 
from that daily television talkfest. A few weeks later _ reportedly 
pressed by Springer _ the syndicator altered that policy, saying it 
would ``responsibly edit'' each show to tone down the violence, while 
keeping the confrontational formula that makes the show so popular. 
Now, whatever the precise policy, the brawling or attempted brawling 
have resumed (the show's beefy black-shirted security guards now step 
in to block some punches and kicks), along with so many bleeps that 
it is often impossible to follow the dialogue, and the show's ratings 
have risen in tandem with its ribaldry. The show's popularity, which 
crosses all age boundaries and appeals to both men and women, keeps 
it thriving despite protests from various community groups, the flight 
of some national sponsors and the fact that some stations make scant 
if any profit on it. It does turn a healthy profit _ estimated at 
$50 million this season _ for Studios USA, a unit of USA Networks, 
and gives a lift to the stations that carry it. Springer's show has 
been No. 1 in the daytime Nielsen ratings for 35 of the last 38 weeks. 
On any given day, it might beat ``Oprah,'' the longtime leader, by 
more than 1 million viewers. In an era when broadcast television audiences 
are declining steadily, ``Jerry Springer'' and ``Judge Judy'' are 
the only syndicated shows with ratings that have grown since last 
season, said Marc Berman of Seltel Inc., an analyst who advises local 
stations about programming choices. ``If you're a station manager 
looking to attract an audience, the quickest way to do it is with 
`Jerry Springer' or `Judge Judy,' '' Berman said. That is the primary 
value of ``Springer'': its large audience often carries over to whatever 
follows it, and it may even help the show that precedes it, because 
people tune in early. Also, placing promotional spots for a station's 
other shows in ``Springer'' guarantees that the spots will be seen 
by many people. ``He's an oddity in that you can put him on at any 
hour of the day, and he'll get a big audience,'' Berman said. ``We've 
seen situations where stations were doing a 1 rating or lower in a 
time period and suddenly they're doing 5s or 6s.'' That in turn lifts 
a station's overall rating for a week, a month or a season. Stations 
often sell advertising time not in individual shows but in certain 
time periods (morning, afternoon or prime time) or in packages that 
place commercials in several different time blocks. An overall higher 
rating can mean higher prices for those packages. All this compensates 
for the lower advertising rates for ``Springer'' itself. Like other 
syndicated shows, ``Jerry Springer'' is sold to stations for a weekly 
licensing fee (as high as $60,000 a week in the most populous markets) 
and some advertising minutes, known as barter. But in a departure 
from the usual, Studios USA keeps only two-and-a-half minutes of barter 
_ because many national advertisers shun ``Springer'' _ leaving stations 
a hefty 12 minutes to sell. ``Because of the clout of its high ratings, 
`Springer' has flipped the typical financial model on its head,'' 
said David Smith, president of entertainment for Frank N. Magid Associates, 
a media market research and consulting firm. ``Stations pay a higher 
licensing fee but give up less barter, because barter is not that 
valuable to Studios USA.'' Some station managers worry that ``Jerry 
Springer'' is not worth its cost because it repels some advertisers 
_ those who want to avoid association with its tawdry image, or those 
seeking a more affluent audience. Those who do advertise in the show 
pay less. This season, a typical national 30-second commercial on 
``Oprah'' costs $48,000, while a similar spot on ``Jerry Springer'' 
costs only $15,000. The ``Springer'' show's commercials are dominated 
by 1-800-number ads _ for technical schools, personal-injury law firms, 
mortgage lenders, insurance companies and health services. The Rev. 
Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Roman Catholic Church in Chicago, 
was the most prominent leader of last spring's protest against ``Jerry 
Springer,'' recruiting church and community groups in other cities 
to denounce the show's violence. In Chicago, the NBC-owned station 
dropped ``Jerry Springer'' in April. When the Fox station, WFLD, leaped 
to buy it, Pfleger persuaded executives there to edit out any physical 
violence. (The station continues to do so; if a punch is thrown, editors 
substitute an audience shot or some other angle.) Pfleger also started 
a campaign to write to companies that advertised on the show, urging 
them to withdraw. Of 19 companies, five have dropped out and one promises 
to do so by Jan. 1, said Vince Clark, Pfleger's assistant.
