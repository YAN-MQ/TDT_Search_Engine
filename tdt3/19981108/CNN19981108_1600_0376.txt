Federal safety experts are looking into ways to better protect older 
children in car wrecks. "The Detroit news" reports the national highway 
and traffic safety administration has assembled a panel of experts, 
including automakers and child seat companies, to study the issue. 
Children older than 4 are too big for child safety seats. But some 
experts say they should sit in booster seats until they're 4'6" tall. 
That could help seat belts made for adults fit them better.
