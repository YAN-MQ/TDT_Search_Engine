Now that he's back on the ground, astronaut John Glenn says he wouldn't 
mind going right back up again. Glenn and the rest of the space shuttle 
"discovery" crew arrived back in houston this afternoon. They returned 
from their nine-day mission yesterday and touched down at kennedy 
space center in Florida. The world's oldest astronaut says he felt 
woozy when he walked off the shuttle, but he's now "95% to 98% back 
to normal." An elated Glenn says he's proud of what he and the crew 
accomplished, and he's taking all the attention in stride. Glenn has 
three weeks of medical tests waiting for him. After that, he says 
his wife annie is very insistent that he does not take any more trips 
into space.
