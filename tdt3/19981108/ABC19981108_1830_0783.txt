to discuss the continuing standoff with Iraq over weapons inspections. 
Sources say President Clinton is weighing whether to give U diplomacy 
and launch military rikes. ABC's Mike leeas the latest. Psident Clinton's 
key advisers flew back to Washington after today's urgent two-hour 
meeting at cp David. According to U.S. official the president was 
briefed on the latest diplomatic and military options. He asked theides 
to follow up on both fronts and report back to him in a Few days. 
But officials say the presidt has madeo decision and that no time

the threat of U.S.-led attacks upon Iraq, Saddam backed down from 
a similar standoff. Today, Iraqi oicials again warned they will not 
allow U.N. Ms inspections until economic sanctions against aq are 
lifted. We will defend our country. And our country is prepared to 
face any military aggression. The Iraqis ha also called for support 
from Arab leaders. The Saudi Arabian foren minister and the egyptn
