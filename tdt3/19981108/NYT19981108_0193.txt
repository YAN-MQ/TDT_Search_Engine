The New Jersey Devils awoke Sunday from the high of Saturday's fourth 
victory in five road games to find two of their most productive players 
unavailable to improve that record against the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
The Devils, who tried to compensate by playing gamely, lost their 
cohesion and the game, 3-1, before 11,514 at the Ice Palace. That 
left them with a 7-5 record and broke a four-game winning streak. 
The Devils were without Bobby Holik, the center who was suspended 
by the National Hockey League pending a hearing Tuesday in New York 
for slew-footing _ taking a player's legs out from under him with 
a sweeping leg movement _ in Saturday's 4-3 victory over Florida. 
Scratched from the lineup with a painful bruised sternum was the wing 
Dave Andreychuk. He was injured late in the Florida game and his condition 
did not improve markedly by the start of the Lightning game. Tampa 
Bay, a recent National Hockey League doormat and Devils' prey, was 
giddy about reaching .500 _ at 6-6-2 _ for the first time in 91 games, 
since Oct. 10, 1997. Playing without Andreychuk and Holik would be 
like the Yankees trying to win without Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez, 
according to Ken Daneyko, the veteran Devils defenseman. ``Their absences 
definitely hurt us,'' Daneyko said. ``Dave is off to his best start 
in years and Bobby is always tough. Under the circumstances, it would 
have been nice to get out of here with a point. But they got a lucky 
goal and then we were playing catch-up.'' Holik, suspended for the 
first time in his career, did not have much to say about the incident 
involving a Florida defenseman, Paul Laus. He was penalized for high-sticking 
although replays showed Holik used his right leg to drop Laus, who 
crashed into the boards and was motionless for more than a minute. 
``There definitely was no intention of hurting him,'' said Holik, 
whose consecutive-games streak was halted at 191. ``I didn't even 
know who he was. It happened so fast. I better not say anything before 
Tuesday, because I might end up deeper than I already am.'' Andreychuk, 
the Devils' top scorer, said only two minutes remained when he was 
hit in the corner by an unidentified Panther. ``I put my arm up and 
that's when he got me,'' Andreychuk said. ``It's still pretty sore, 
but I don't think I'll be out long.'' Stripped of two of his main 
offensive threats, Devils Coach Robbie Ftorek did some significant 
line-switching against Tampa Bay. He tinkered with a combination of 
Patrick Elias, Brendan Morrison and Petr Sykora, which he had abandoned 
early in the season for being quick but small. Sunday, that line gave 
the Devils their only source of offense. With New Jersey trailing 
by 1-0 in the second period, Morrison seized a loose puck along the 
left boards and pushed it toward the Lightning net. He made a perfectly 
timed cross-ice pass to Sykora, who shot from 10 feet to tie the score 
at 7 minutes 17 seconds of the second period. The night before, Elias 
had been on a line with with Holik and Randy McKay. Sunday, McKay 
played alongside Jason Arnott and Vadim Sharifijanov. Even Bob Carpenter, 
usually a center, spent the whole game at left wing, a position he 
had not played in six years. ``No problem,'' he said. ``It's much 
easier to go from center to left wing than it is to go from left wing 
to center.'' The Lightning forged ahead to stay early in the final 
period. Sykora thought he had control of the puck near the net, but 
Michal Sykora _ no relation _ swooped in from behind and hit the Devil 
player's stick, knocking the puck by goalie Martin Brodeur. ``It surprised 
me a little,'' Brodeur said. Tampa Bay added an open-net goal with 
53 seconds left. ``I like the way the guys played,'' Ftorek said. 
``I just didn't like the result.''
