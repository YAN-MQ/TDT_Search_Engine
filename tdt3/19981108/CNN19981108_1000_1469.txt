in belgium over the weekend. Up for bid, dozens of Teddy bears dressed 
in designer clothes. German toymaker steiff donated the bears. Top 
designers -- bally, hermes, Ferrari and others -- provided the bears' 
clothing. One bear wearing a Louis vuitton outfit sold for $43,000. 
The money raised, roughly $315,000, will be given to a Belgian children's 
hospital.
