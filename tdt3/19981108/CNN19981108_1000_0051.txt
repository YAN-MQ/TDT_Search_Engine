Space hasn't lost any of its magic for John Glenn. The pioneer astronaut 
is talking with reporters at the Kennedy space center at this hour 
about what it was like to return there 36 years after his first mission. 
His mission colleagues are joining him with stories of their flight 
experiences. America's oldest person in space, the 77 year-old senator 
described the nine days he spent on board the space shuttle "discovery," 
its effect on his body, and the whole experience of seeing the earth 
from orbit for a Second time. I don't think you could be on a mission 
like this about learning about yourself. It's such a new and different 
experience. I was up which back in '62, but this is different this 
time. Where you free flowed. If we were all in a spacecraft right 
now, you would have to be tied down or you would be floating up toward 
the ceiling. So it's different working in that kind of an environment 
than it was before where I couldn't do that. "Discovery" touched down 
at the Kennedy space center yesterday. Later today, Glenn and his 
colleagues will fly to Houston for a reunion with family and friends.
