Flushed out of her village by Hurricane Mitch's flood waters and drifting 
for six days far into the Caribbean Sea, Laura Isabel Arriola de Guity 
was alone. Her husband and three children were dead. All she had was 
a makeshift raft, the sea below her, the sun in the day and the moon 
at night. There was no land in sight. On the sixth day, she spotted 
a duck near her raft. ``I started to talk with this duck,'' she recalled. 
``I said 'Little duck, send a message that I'm alive. Take me to my 
people. Take me to the shore.'' ``I started crying and I said, 'Why 
don't you take me so that I can fly somewhere with you?''' Arriola's 
desperation ended hours later. She was spotted by an airplane looking 
for a yacht that had disappeared during the storm. A British helicopter 
rescued her. Arriola, a 36-year-old school teacher, is recovering 
from dehydration, sun exposure and hypothermia at a hospital in the 
northern Honduran city of Trujillo. She is expected to be released 
soon. In an interview in her ward, Arriola tried in vain to told hold 
back the tears as she described six days of terror and miracles, surviving 
a storm officials say killed at least 10,000 people in Central America. 
Arriola and her family lived in the village of Barra de Aguan, near 
the mouth of the Aguan River. Normally her house was about two miles 
(three kilometers) from the sea on one side and more than a mile (a 
kilometer and a half) from the river on the other. But when Hurricane 
Mitch stalled over the Honduran coast Oct. 28, the sea and the river 
merged into what seemed like a single body of water. Arriola's house 
was quickly swept away, so her family took refuge at a neighbor's 
home. Fourteen people climbed onto the roof, but when a wall collapsed 
below, they returned downstairs. They briefly found shelter in one 
room, but a wall there also caved in and the river tore through the 
house. Arriola held on to her 4-year-old son, Andersson Moises, and 
shouted at her husband and brother-in-law to grab the other two children: 
Frances Elizabeth, 8, and Ricardo Gerson, 10. She tried to hold onto 
her son, but the river ripped them apart. ``I tried to float so I 
could see over the water,'' she said. ``I swam and swam, trying to 
save him, trying to get to somewhere dry. And then I realized I was 
already in the sea.'' She never saw her family again. Arriola, a strong 
swimmer, clung to some floating palm branches for four hours. Using 
debris in the water, she made a 4-foot by 4-foot (1.2-meter by 1.2-meter) 
raft out of tree roots, branches and a mortar board. ``I was thinking, 
I was begging God to let someone find me and rescue me,'' she said. 
``But there was no one. No one saw me'' Debris littered the sea. Arriola 
spotted the corpse of a child, along with several dead animals. But 
she also found coconuts, which gave her milk, as well as pineapples 
and oranges. On the second day, she spotted two islands in the distance, 
which she believed were Roatan and Utila _ about 100 miles (160 kilometers) 
from her home. But the sea and winds pushed her in the other direction. 
Arriola slept little. Rough seas made it difficult to rest and she 
was knocked off the raft several times. ``The worst part for me was 
after being with my whole family, with my children, my husband, that 
I could be so alone in the sea without seeing anybody,'' she said. 
``I cried every day. I was crying more than I was quiet. Day and night 
I cried and screamed. I was praying, worshipping. I did it all. The 
only thing I couldn't do was run, because there was no place for me 
to run to.'' She passed time singing religious songs, talking to God 
and to her husband and children. ``I wasn't feeling so lonely when 
I was thinking of them as if they were close to me.'' Her prayers 
bore fruit Nov. 2, when she saw a plane flying by and waved at it. 
It turned and passed over her again. ``I was trying to stand up on 
the raft, but a wave threw me in the sea,'' she said. She climbed 
back on the raft and took off her black T-shirt because she thought 
her red bra might be more visible. The plane passed again, this time 
dropping something in the water that exploded. It was likely intended 
to mark the spot, but Arriola was scared she was being bombed. The 
plane descended and passed again. This time, she could see two people 
inside who gestured toward her. About a half hour later, she saw something 
in the air that she thought was a bird. It turned out to be a British 
helicopter coming to rescue her. A crewman was lowered to the raft, 
placed Arriola in a harness and she was pulled on board. ``I told 
him, thank God you have saved me. Thank God,'' she said. She said 
she doesn't know where she was picked up, but news accounts said it 
was 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Guanaja Island _ about 75 miles 
(120 kilometers) from her home. The crew members at first thought 
she might have been a survivor of the Fantome, a Windjammer schooner 
apparently destroyed during the storm with 31 crew members aboard. 
She says she'll likely live with relatives after being discharged. 
The bodies of her husband and daughter have been found. The other 
two children are presumed dead. Arriola is despondent about her future. 
``I have nothing. I have nowhere to go,'' she said. ``I lost it all.''
