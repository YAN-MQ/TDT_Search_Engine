The United States ended its requalification efforts on a perfect note 
Sunday, defeating Austria 2-0 in a meaningless match at the A-Pool 
qualification tournament. After cruising past Kazakhstan and Estonia 
to re-establish their position among hockey's A-Pool elite, the United 
States blanked host Austria on the final day, confirming the team 
never really belonged in international hockey's lesser level. Defenseman 
Chris Luongo, who plays for Landshut in the German league, opened 
scoring for the United States on a pass from former 1980 Olympic veteran 
Neal Broten. Frankfurt Lions' Bob Sweeney scored the insurance goal 
with less than five minutes remaining in the final period, assisted 
by Joe Mullen, the all-time American leading scorer, and Klagenfurt's 
American import David Emma. The loss counted little for Austria who 
finished second in the group A rankings, enough to retain their place 
in the A-Pool. ``It was an honor to coach such a great team,'' said 
head U.S. coach Ben Smith, who led the American women to gold at the 
Nagano Winter Games. ``The eyes of America may not be turned on these 
players and we probably won't make the headlines, but from a hockey 
standpoint this was very important for the United States. ``I think 
this tournament showed that experience counts,'' added Smith. ``Some 
of these guys haven't played in ages.'' Neal Broten, who helped lead 
the Americans to a surprise gold medal at the 1980 Olympic Games in 
Lake Placid, returned to hockey in a city bidding for the 2006 Winter 
Games, playing a key role in preventing his country from dropping 
to the B-Pool. The leading scorer on the American team with three 
goals and three assists, Broten only came out of retirement to lend 
a hand at U.S.A. Hockey's insistence. ``They approached me,'' said 
Broten, who turns 39 at the end of the month. ``I really had no interest 
in playing anymore. ``I hadn't played in two years.'' Having skated 
just 15 times since retiring two years ago, Broten admitted feeling 
sore after the team's opening match against Kazakhstan on Thursday. 
``I skated maybe eight times after deciding to come,'' said Broten, 
collecting a pair of goals and an assist in the Americans' 3-0 opening 
win over the Kazaks. In other group A action, Kazakhstan took out 
its frustration by defeating Estonia 8-0 for third place in the group. 
Winless Estonia finished fourth, resulting in both teams descending 
to the B-Pool. Unbeaten Ukraine topped the group B table after defeating 
Slovenia in a final dead rubber, preserving its place in the A-Pool. 
Posting a 3-1 win over Germany, France finished second in group B 
to requalify. While thankful of avoiding the public relations disaster 
that would have accompanied the Americans' elimination, Hockey's ruling 
body will still have to suffer the bitter blow to the world championships' 
pocket book that comes with money-spinning Germany's failure to requalify. 
Slovenia will also drop to the B-pool.
