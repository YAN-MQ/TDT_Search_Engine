The poor showing by the Republicans in the elections last week reinforced 
what public-opinion polls have indicated for months _ people are sick 
and tired of the Clinton-Lewinsky investigation. But they are evidently 
not that sick and tired. Since first reports of President Clinton's 
extramarital affair broke in January, the weekly television ratings 
of the 24-hour news networks like Time-Warner Inc.'s CNN; MSNBC, owned 
by both General Electric and Microsoft; and the Fox News Channel of 
News Corp. have spiked each time there has been a significant development 
in the case. You could hardly blame the networks for hoping for long, 
drawn-out impeachment hearings. For the week that ended on Aug. 23, 
after Clinton acknowledged having an inappropriate relationship, the 
networks had their highest ratings of the year. Even the elections, 
which generally are events that play to the networks' strengths, failed 
to approach the ratings of turning points in the Lewinsky matter. 
Sales of news magazines have also been bolstered. In the first half 
of the year, the issues that appeared after reports of the relationship 
emerged were the top newsstand sellers for Newsweek and U.S. News 
&AMP; World Report and ranked No. 2 for Time behind a cover story 
on a man named Jordan (Michael, not Vernon).
