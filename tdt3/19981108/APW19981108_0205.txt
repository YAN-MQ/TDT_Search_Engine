Turkey has sent into northern Iraq some 25,000 troops, backed by war 
planes and helicopters, to fight Turkish Kurdish rebels, according 
to news reports Sunday. Military authorities in Ankara would neither 
confirm nor deny the reports. In Brussels, Mizgin Sen, a spokeswoman 
for a Kurdish organization that includes members of the rebel Kurdistan 
Worker's Party (PKK) said that a Turkish military operation was underway 
to secure the border before winter settles in. Turkey recently stepped 
up its battle to end the 14-year-old war by autonomy-seeking rebels. 
The Turkish daily Hurriyet said the latest operation against rebel 
hideouts began Thursday, with troops pushing some 30 kilometers (19 
miles) inside Iraq. Turkish troops have staged several such operations 
in northern Iraq, which the PKK uses as a base to wage cross-border 
attacks on Turkey., The operation was reportedly prompted by the recent 
entry into northern Iraq of some 400 rebels from Syria. Turkey pressured 
Syria last month into ending its alleged support to the rebels. On 
Sunday, the leaders of the two Iraqi Kurdish factions that control 
northern Iraq met in Ankara to discuss a recent peace agreement signed 
between the two groups in Washington. After years of fighting for 
the control of the region, Massoud Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic 
Party and Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan agreed 
in September to share power in northern Iraq and hold elections next 
year. Turkey is strongly opposed to any move aiming at the creation 
of an independent Kurdish state, which could inspire the PKK in its 
battle for autonomy in Turkey. ``The two leaders discussed the strengthening 
of our relations with Turkey and working together for peace and stability 
in the region,'' Hoshiyar Zebari of the Democratic Party said. In 
a move to appease Turkey, both Iraqi Kurdish groups agreed in Washington 
to join in Ankara's battle against the PKK. Barzani's forces were 
reportedly fighting along the Turkish army in Thursday's operation.
