Voters in Nevada sent Harry Reid back to the U.S. Senate this week 
-- at least, that's the way it looks now. But the results could change, 
pending a court-ordered recount of 15,000 absentee ballots in one 
county. The machines used to count those ballots failed in a postelection 
test, and that could have resulted in an incorrect tally. Reid beat 
republican congressman John Ensign by only 459 votes. But a spokesman 
for the senator says he's confident his victory will hold.
