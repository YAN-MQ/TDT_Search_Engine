veteran astronaut John Glenn says his second space mission was different 
than the one he took 36 years ago. Today, he and the six other crew 
members of the space shuttle "discovery" talked about their nine days 
in orbit. Glenn says his body is about 90% to 95% readapted to gravity. 
During the mission, the 77-year-old astronaut participated in a round 
of tests on the effects of weightlessness on older people. Glenn says 
he was a bit stiff after the flight. Well, a little difficult. I was 
walking a little spread-legged yesterday to keep my balance a little 
bit. But everything went very well. We went through all the medical 
tests yesterday, and as far as I know, everything is going out very 
well so far. We will go back and we have the next two weeks, almost 
three weeks at -- as curt said, we will be going through very extensive 
medical tests. And we're already on body collection fluids and things 
like that already this morning to follow up on yesterday, and we'll 
be doing that for the next several days. Glenn and the "discovery" 
crew traveled nearly 4 million miles and orbited the earth 134 times. 
Doctors will spend the next few weeks monitoring Glenn and taking 
blood tests. He will also undergo about six months of monthly muscle 
and bone tests.
