Central Americans battled to get roads, water supplies and health 
care working again, to reach flood victims and avoid the outbreak 
of diseases after the region was battered by Hurricane Mitch. Across 
flooded Central America, health authorities were warning that diseases 
such as malaria and cholera could spread in the weeks to come. Twenty-five 
cases of cholera have been reported in Guatemala, the Public Health 
Ministry there reported Friday. The Guatemalan government has increased 
water-treatment efforts to prevent the disease from spreading. International 
relief flights delivered the first water purification machines and 
needed medicines. ``We have supplies, but everything is going very 
slowly. The situation is very serious and there is a lot of concern 
there could be many more deaths,'' Tom Turley of the Connecticut-based 
aid group Americares said Saturday. The American Red Cross on Sunday 
was sending enough food to supply 1,000 families for one month in 
the southern Honduran city of Choluteca, which was cut off from the 
rest of the country by land until Saturday. The shipments included 
rice, beans, vegetable oil, maize and toohpaste. ``The Honduran Red 
Cross is giving out all they have. Everything incoming is absolutely 
necessary,'' said Ann Stingle, of the American Red Cross. The American 
organiation was sending 40 tons of water purification chemicals and 
antibiotics.
