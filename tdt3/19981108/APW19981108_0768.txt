Anders Huusko's second goal in the game early in the third period 
salvaged a 2-2 tie for world champion Sweden against archrival Finland 
in the Karjala Cup tournament Sunday. Huusko also tied the game at 
one goal apiece at 3:50 in the opening period, 42 seconds after Jere 
Karalahti had put the hosts one up. Jari Kauppila made it 2-1 for 
Finland in the second period before a near-sellout crowd of 12,386. 
The Czech Republic and Russia tied 2-2 in the other game Sunday. Finland 
clinched first place Saturday by beating the Czechs 5-3. The tournament 
was the second in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden won the first tournament 
in the Czech Republic two months ago. Finland now leads the overall 
standings.
