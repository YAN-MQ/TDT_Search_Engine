Former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet tells "the London Sunday 
times" his faith in Britain has been shaken. He's being held in London 
while Spanish authorities work to extradite him on charges of genocide, 
terrorism and torture. Demonstrations in trafalgar square drew Chilean 
exiles from all over europe. They want Pinochet to be brought to justice 
for murders during his 17-year rule. Pinochet says he should have 
been granted diplomatic immunity in Britain. And he says his arrest 
is damaging Chile's "peaceful transition" to democracy.
