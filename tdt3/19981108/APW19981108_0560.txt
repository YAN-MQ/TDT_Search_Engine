A new trial against a previously banned Belgrade daily critical of 
President Slobodan Milosevic's rule opened Sunday, roughly 24 hours 
after the paper resumed publishing following weeks of government bans, 
court trials and police raids. In its first edition Saturday, Dnevni 
Telegraf ran an ad paid by a Belgrade University student group that 
called for the abolishment of the existing government, saying ``Resistance 
is the answer. There is no other way, otherwise it will be too late 
...This is not a system, this is a disease, ... Pull yourselves together 
and resist!'' Within hours, Bratislava Morina, Serbia's top official 
for refugees and a close Milosevic associate, sued the daily for running 
the ad, saying it violated Serbia's recently enacted media law by 
``jeopardizing the sovereignty and territorial integrity'' of the 
state. Dnevni Telegraf was first banned last month under a government 
decree demanding strictly ``patriotic'' coverage of events _ especially 
the ongoing crisis in Serbia's Kosovo province _ from both independent 
and state-run media. Two other papers were also banned. The decree 
was then superseded by a restrictive media law that levied hefty fines 
on media for articles authorities deemed anti-state. Under the new 
law, Dnevni Telegraf's publishers and editors were fined a total of 
dlrs 246,000 for articles in a sister weekly magazine. When they refused 
to pay, police raided the newspaper's Belgrade office, hauling away 
equipment in partial compensation for the money owed. The paper found 
a loophole to continue publishing by reregistering from Serbia in 
Montenegro, the other Yugoslav republic. Sunday's trial, which took 
place behind closed doors, has also hurt already tense relations between 
Yugoslavia's two republics. Montenegro's pro-Western officials protested 
against Serbian authorities ``harassment'' of independent publications 
now registered in their republic. The defendants and their lawyers 
stormed out of the Belgrade district court after two hours of the 
hearings, protesting what they saw ``partiality'' of the judge. The 
judge was expected to pass a verdict later Sunday, although it would 
not be made public until Monday. A leading opposition party, the Democrats, 
criticized the trial as unjust. ``It's a staged trial whose only purpose 
is to stifle media freedom,'' they said in a statement. ``It reminds 
of the worst Stalinist and fascist trials, where the verdict is know 
in advance and the defendant has no chance to prove innocence.'' Milosevic 
virtually controls state-run media and has sought for years to suppress 
the independent media. His efforts increased late last month, under 
the threat of NATO airstrikes as punishment for Serbia's crackdown 
in its province of Kosovo.
