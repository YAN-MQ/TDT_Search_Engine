This town is so picture perfect, the houses have booking agents. That 
is one sign of how often advertising agencies have sent film crews 
here, looking for the shaded streets, putting-green lawns and perfect 
homes that shout upper-middle-class suburbia. They have settled on 
a few choice neighborhoods in this town of 38,000, where the gracious 
old homes evoke Rockwell or Gatsby and provide ideal backdrops for 
selling everything from minivans to Grey Poupon. Town officials and 
many residents see all this as burnishing Montclair's glossy image, 
and have greeted the crews _ who pay handsomely for the privilege 
to shoot _ with open arms, a streamlined permit system and a can-do 
approach to solving logistical problems. But others are not impressed. 
They complain that as the number of film projects increases _ with 
their hordes of technicians and actors, their trucks, R.V.'s, loud 
and smelly generators and huge spotlights that seek to improve on 
daylight at a steady 5,200 degrees Kelvin _ the lines in Montclair 
between residential and commercial, genteel and crass, are becoming 
blurred. ``I didn't move here to be in the middle of Universal Studios,'' 
said Chris Howley. ``They think it is prestigious to have a million-dollar 
home and rent it out like this for commercials? I don't get it.'' 
But a few blocks away, Betty Hudson said it was ``terrific'' that 
advertisers found the houses so picturesque that they paid homeowners 
$2,000 a day to film in one. She said she had rented out her house 
at least a dozen times in the last four years for commercial shoots. 
As a former vice president for corporate communications with NBC who 
is married to Boyd Matson, host of the syndicated television show 
``National Geographic,'' Ms. Hudson concedes she and her family are 
more accustomed to the rigors of filming than many others. ``But it 
also brings a lot of money into the community,'' she said. ``I don't 
call it being star struck. I call it taking appropriate pride.'' On 
Tuesday, town officials have scheduled a public hearing to review 
the town's nearly year-old regulations on filming and to discuss whether 
any changes need to be made before January. The current law, which 
allows a homeowner to get a permit for a film production at least 
three times a year _ and up to 10 times a year if neighbors and the 
township manager agree _ is a revision of a 1985 law that came to 
be viewed as too lax. That law replaced a hands-off approach that 
also became untenable as filming increased. Although feature films 
are occasionally shot on location in Montclair _ ``The Devil's Own'' 
and ``One True Thing'' are two recent examples _ nearly all the film 
projects in the area are television commercials. In 1997, location 
shootings for commercials across the country increased 8 percent over 
1996, said Dave Perry, chairman of the production committee of the 
American Association of Advertising Agencies. Montclair, along with 
Fort Lee, N.J., and New Rochelle, N.Y., are among the more ``film-friendly'' 
towns near Manhattan that Perry said were benefiting from this increase. 
``The reason that Montclair gets a lot of business is that its old 
homes have large rooms, high ceilings and big doorways,'' Perry said, 
noting how important it was for production companies to be able to 
squeeze lights, cameras and lots of people into a room.'' A paradox 
behind this, however, is that the esthetic distinction that draws 
film crews to Montclair _ its homes' varied and interestingly shingled 
facades and grand porches, their Victorian wallpaper and elaborate 
moldings _ often is nowhere to be seen in the finished commercials. 
The details are left on the cutting room floor or are shown so fleetingly 
that they are unrecognizable, and what actually ends up on TV renders 
Montclair as Anyplace, U.S.A. The town has seen a clear increase in 
the number of permits issued for filming. There were 54 permits and 
the equivalent of 118 filming days in 1996, and 55 permits and 121 
filming days last year. This year, 76 permits have already been issued, 
resulting so far in 127 filming days. By this accounting, a single 
day could represent as many as four filming days if four film crews 
were working at different locations. ``They've invaded my community 
and turned it into a business district,'' said Monica Abbott, who 
has become one of the more active opponents of the filming and wants 
to see it banned altogether. ``It's making the streets dangerous, 
and somebody is going to get hit, and that will be a great Kodak moment,'' 
she said.
