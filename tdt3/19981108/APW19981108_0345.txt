European soccer officials gathered Sunday to decide how to punish 
Fiorentina over an explosion last week that injured a match official 
and caused the suspension of a UEFA Cup game against Grasshoppers. 
The Italian club risks forfeiting the match and thus being kicked 
out of this season's _ and possibly future _ European soccer competition. 
It could also face a hefty fine. Fiorentina will be considered lucky 
if UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Commission merely orders Tuesday's 
match replayed behind closed doors. Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after 
the first 45 minutes of play. Having won the first leg against the 
Swiss side 2-0, it expected easily to advance to the third round of 
the UEFA Cup. But the match in Salerno, near Naples, was suspended 
after a Belgian off-field official was injured by the explosion of 
a device hurled from the stands at the interval. Philippe Flament, 
the ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield helping the referee and 
linesmen, was taken to hospital with a right knee injury. Fiorentina 
officials have argued that the team should not be punished as it was 
the act of an isolated individual rather than a large group of their 
fans. Italian papers reported that police questioned a local Salerno 
man who was a suspect. Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history 
of rivalry. The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina 
was paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi 
stadium as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup game. 
Fiorentina hoped to raise funds for victims of recent flooding in 
southern Italy. Even though not on its home ground, it was still responsible 
for security. If Fiorentina does lose the match through default, then 
Grasshoppers will play Bordeaux of France in the third round Nov. 
24 and Dec. 8.
