LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ ``They come once in a lifetime,'' Sonny Hine said 
after the final curtain had been lowered on Skip Away. ``Sure, I'm 
unhappy to lose him. For the last three years, he's been our life.'' 
Skip Away did not need a eulogy. True, in his final performance, he 
ran sixth in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Saturday 
and went home with no money, meaning that his brilliant career at 
the races was ending $383,455 short of Sonny Hine's obsession: to 
pass Cigar at $9,999,815 and become racing's richest horse. And in 
his race before that one, the $1-million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont 
Park, Skip Away ran third. So, he was fading into the sunset with 
a two-race losing streak. But nobody knows better than Sonny Hine 
that Skip Away had a winning streak of nine before he had a losing 
streak of two, and that he went to the post 38 times in his career, 
won 18 times and finished in the money 34 times. He ran in 21 Grade 
I stakes, and finished first, second or third 20 times. This year, 
he won seven of nine. So, relax, Sonny, you may have lost the battle 
of the Breeders' Cup, but not the war for horse of the year honors. 
Skippy became the durable superstar who took the baton from Cigar, 
who took it from Holy Bull, in an unbroken string of virtuoso performances 
in the 1990s, when racing was declining as a business but apparently 
not as a sport. ``I've been on the road for the last 36 years,'' the 
67-year-old Hine said, reflectively. ``You live in hotels and motels. 
I went into a store in Louisville, and they offered me a 10 percent 
senior citizen's discount. I wondered where the years had gone. ``It's 
very touching, what's going on. I used to cry when watching Lassie 
movies. I cried at `E.T.' That was the last movie we saw.'' He also 
cried at the Breeders' Cup Classic, but he could have saved the tears. 
On a resplendent but cool afternoon in Kentucky, racing staged its 
$13.2-million day of championships before a record crowd of 80,452. 
It was a day of sheer suspense that saw some sad endings in the Classic 
for Skip Away (sixth), Coronado's Quest (fifth after leading for one 
mile) and Gentlemen (10th and last with pulmonary bleeding, after 
his owner had gambled $800,000 in supplemental entry fees to get him 
into the race). But the 15th Breeders' Cup also played to some great 
theater with happy beginnings. And as surely as Skip Away, Gentlemen 
and Coronado's Quest closed their honorable careers, new heroes rose 
dramatically. First, nothing matches the soap-opera comeback of the 
6-year-old Da Hoss. He won the $1-million Mile race in October 1996, 
then missed two years of racing with a series of injuries. But he 
was revived by his patient trainer, Michael Dickinson, a creative 
Yorkshireman who keeps an imported, eight-horse exercise machine on 
his farm in Maryland. And Da Hoss, after winning one warm-up race 
last month, promptly won the Mile for the second time, two years later. 
``We've had a lot of dark days and long nights,'' Dickinson said. 
``We keep him at the farm. When he gets to the race track, he goes 
ballistic. ``Da Hoss won't start again until Gulfstream Park in next 
year's Breeders' Cup _ this time, without a prep.'' But the new leading 
man in racing is the 4-year-old colt named Awesome Again, who not 
only won the Classic in a blanket finish with four horses less than 
one length apart, but also closed out his year with a perfect record: 
6 for 6. His trainer is Patrick Byrne, the newest hero of the Breeders' 
Cup. He hit two home runs in his first two at-bats last year when 
he won the two juvenile championships with Countess Diana and Favorite 
Trick, who also nosed out Skip Away for horse of the year. After that, 
the plot became too corny to be true: Byrne, an engaging 42-year-old 
Englishman, surrendered tutelage of his two champions to accept a 
job as trainer for Frank Stronach, a global auto-parts dealer who 
owns homes in Canada, Switzerland, Florida, Colorado and Kentucky, 
and also is buying the Santa Anita race track. And one of Stronach's 
900 horses is Awesome Again. ``He thinks he's King Kong,'' Byrne said 
Sunday morning. But, if Sonny Hine will forgive us, he added: ``I 
think you can make a good case for Awesome Again for horse of the 
year. He is unbeaten and, when the time came, he beat the best horses 
around in the richest race there is.'' Bob Baffert knows the highs 
and lows of the game. Remember, he won both the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness in the last two years but was nosed out in the Belmont both 
times. In the Breeders' Cup on Saturday, his gallant horse, Silver 
Charm, lost the richest race in the world by three-quarters of a length. 
When asked to comment Sunday morning, Baffert shook his finger at 
Pat Byrne, and said with stage severity: ``I'm mad at you.''
