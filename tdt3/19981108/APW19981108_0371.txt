Guerrillas fired a rocket, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades at 
Israeli-backed militiamen Sunday, provoking Israeli air and artillery 
retaliation, security officials said. There was no immediate word 
on casualties from the early morning fighting in the eastern sector 
of the Israeli-occupied buffer zone in south Lebanon, the officials 
said. Guerrillas attacked a barracks of Israel's proxy militia called 
the South Lebanon Army at Kawkaba inside the occupied enclave, seven 
kilometers (four miles) southwest of the border town of Rashaya. There 
was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Israeli helicopters 
gunships opened up with machine guns as the guerrillas withdrew under 
artillery and tank fire from Israeli and militia positions, according 
to the officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity. At 
least 150 shells blasted the area, the Lebanese officials added. In 
Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said one rocket was fired at 
an SLA position, but there were no casualties. Israeli and SLA artillery 
returned fire, he said. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group is leading 
a guerrilla war to expel Israeli forces and their allied Lebanese 
militiamen from the 440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer) enclave, 
which Israel established in 1985 to guard against cross-border guerrilla 
forays. The zone has a predominantly Shiite population of 200,000.
