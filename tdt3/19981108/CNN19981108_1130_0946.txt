Planning your next vacation? You might want to consider Canada. Lori 
Waffenschmidt explains in this edition of "working ahead." Canada 
is a hot travel deal, and Americans are flocking north in record numbers. 
The airfares are less expensive and it's very easy to get there, it's 
very convenient. It's English-speaking and the value is good. U.S. 
dollars go far in many places. Take advantage of a lot of shopping, 
a lot of city life, museums, sports activities. There's cities all 
across Canada in addition to more rural areas that provide opportunities 
for more active adventure kinds of travel. But hotel rooms, especially 
in border cities, may be harder to find. Occupancy levels in some 
cities are up as much as 8% over the prior year. And taxes on Canadian 
goods and services can add up. U.S. citizens can get a tax refund 
and have up to a year to apply. I'll bring a little calculator with 
me and figure out if I'll come out ahead and might spend a little 
more money. The Canadian "loonie" may be a bargain for a while. I 
haven't seen any incentives undertaken in Canada so far to change 
the exchange rate. It seems to be beneficial. The economy is doing 
well in Canada, too. So beneficial the Canadian tourism commission 
predicts travel there will remain strong over the next decade. Lori 
Waffenschmidt, CNN, reporting.
