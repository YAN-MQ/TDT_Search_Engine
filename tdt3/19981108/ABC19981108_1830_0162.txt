The poor showing by republicans in E midterm election doesn't just 
change thingsor Newt Gingrich. It changeshem for President Clinton, 
as well. Tomorrow, a house Judiciary subcommittee takes up the impeachment 
question again. Here's ABC's Sam Donaldson. For President Clinton 
and the democrats, the elections were supposed to be a painful intermission 
inhe impeachment process. A lot of people thght they'd pay a price 
for the scandal that for so many months had overshadowed other issues. 
Instead, the republica and their leader took the hit, watchi their 
majority shrink in the House of Representatives and their eaker resign, 
while Mr. clinton once againefied the odds and came out ahead. Thpresident's 
steady strategy throughout the scand and the impeachment proceedings 
S been to tend to business, to try to stay above the fra to do what 
presidents do. That's what he'll be doing this week, making vetans 
day aparances on wednesday in Washington, then traveling to Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia, whe he'll focus on the world financial problems 
at an Asian summit. While Mr. Clinton is busy being presidential, 
republicans will split their attention betwee choosing a new lder 
and steering the impeachment process th started. I think the amerin 
public, on my watch, wants us to do this historically right, come 
out with an answ that makes some sense, sift through the facts and 
make a judgment based on sound law and not politics. They want us 
to get it over sooner rather than later, but they want us to get it 
ght. That'in the hands of Congress and the American people. I said 
that before, I'llay it again. I have nothing else to say about th. 
The republicans appear to want to settle the peachment issue quickly. 
D a lot of people think the president is now O the hook. But as we've 
seen thisear, Carole, predictions are mighty risky. So perhaps we 
should wait until the final chapter is in fact written. Thank you, 
Sam Donaldson at thehite house.
