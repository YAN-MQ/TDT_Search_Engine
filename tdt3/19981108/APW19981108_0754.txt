Dudley Hart, who had won only once in eight years on the PGA Tour, 
shot a 3-under 69 Sunday to overtake Bob Tway and win the Sarazen 
World Open by four strokes. Hart, who won the 1996 Canadian Open, 
had a 272 total to earn the dlrs 360,000 first prize in the non-PGA 
Tour event worth dlrs 2 million. Tway, who led Hart by one stroke 
entering the final round, shot a 74 over the par 72, 6,993-yard (6,392-meter) 
Legends course at Chateu Elan. He wound up at 276. Hart, whose best 
finish this season was a tie for third at the Western Open, got even 
with Tway at the par 4, 423-yard (387-meter) first hole when he made 
par and Tway bogeyed. Hart took the lead for good by two strokes at 
No. 4 where he parred and Tway had a double-bogey. Tway never got 
any closer the rest of the dreary, chilly day in which a light rain 
fell for most of the round and the temperature barely reached 50 F 
(10 C) . Two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer shot a 68 and was 
third at 277. John Huston, who won at Disney two weeks ago, had the 
day's best round _ a 65 _ and was next at 278. Andrew Coltart of Scotland 
and Miguel Angel Jimenez tied for fifth at 279. Coltart had a 69 and 
Jimenez a 71. Hart, who earned a career-best dlrs 553,729 on the PGA 
Tour this year, tied the tournament record Saturday with a 62. On 
Sunday, his steady round included four birdies and one bogey. Edward 
Fryatt, who led after two rounds before fading with an 11-over Saturday, 
was far back at 290 after a 73. Defending champion Mark Calcavecchia 
shot a 76 for 292 in this tournament that brings together the past 
two champions from open tourneys around the world, and several Sarazen 
selections. Two-time winner Frank Nobilo of New Zealand (1995-96) 
had aa 81 and was at 307, 19-over and last among the 56 players who 
made the cut.
