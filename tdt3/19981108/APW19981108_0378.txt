Hours before the arrival of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Morocco 
on Sunday announced plans for new jobs and housing in this disputed 
territory it claims as part of its kingdom but whose fate is to be 
decided by referendum. Interior Minister Driss Basri said the ``royal 
directive'' from King Hassan II includes plans to build 20,000 housing 
units and provide 20,000 jobs for natives of the Western Sahara, known 
as Sahraouis. Addressing local officials, Basri said an additional 
20,000 housing units would be built after the referendum -- now expected 
in December 1999 -- to house those ``who return to their mother country.'' 
He was referring to backers of the Polisario Front seeking independence 
for the Western Sahara in bloody desert skirmishes with Moroccan soldiers 
that endured for years. Annan's trip here could serve as a leveler 
in the highly-charged dispute over the future of the mineral-rich 
desert territory claimed by Morocco since 1975, when Spain abandoned 
it. The United Nations has pushed for seven years to organize a referendum. 
Annan was to get a firsthand view of the U.N. military observer team 
here, known as Minursa, organizing the referendum, which has been 
delayed by differences over who can take part. The U.N. chief was 
arriving from Mauritanian. He also is to visit Morocco and Algeria, 
which once openly backed the Polisario Front and harbors refugees 
in the Tindouf camp in southern Algeria. Basri's announcement of plans 
to help Sahraouis was likely to anger the Polisario. Earlier Sunday, 
from Algeria, the Polisario Front said the Western Sahara dispute 
will continue ``as long as long as the Sahraoui people have not freely 
exercised their inalienable right to independence, and done so in 
incontestable circumstances of freedom and confidence.'' The U.N.'s 
referendum proposal was accepted by both sides in 1991, but critical 
differences over how to identify those eligible have brought the process 
to a halt countless times. Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker 
was called in to unblock the impasse. Annan last month suggested the 
referendum, originally set for December, be held in December 1999. 
To date, 147,249 people have been declared eligible to take part in 
the referendum. But another 65,000 are contested. Annan's visit comes 
two days after Morocco celebrated the 23rd anniversary of its so-called 
Green March on the Western Sahara when, in 1975, hundreds of thousands 
of Moroccans marched into the territory. Morocco has since poured 
millions of dollars into developing the region. The Moroccan monarch, 
marking the Green March in a speech Friday, blamed the numerous delays 
in the referendum on ``the maneuvers of our adversaries.'' But Hassan 
added that Morocco, like Kofi Annan, is ``armed with patience.'' The 
last visit to the Western Sahara by a U.N. chief was in November 1994, 
by Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
