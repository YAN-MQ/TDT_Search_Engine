The Giants can relax now, with their quest for a second straight dream 
season all but ended Sunday in a 10-point loss to Dallas. This was 
a good enough effort, but still a loss. After the game, Percy Ellsworth 
said, ``They won, but they didn't walk over us.'' Last season the 
Giants celebrated winning both games from the Cowboys by making sweeping 
motions with imaginary brooms after a 20-7 victory here. Many Giants 
assumed that Dallas was out for revenge Sunday. Perhaps that is the 
point of the Giants' failed season: They were still thinking of last 
season. The Cowboys were in the here and now. Dallas didn't want to 
walk over the Giants. They wanted to win, wanted to give Emmitt Smith 
the yards he needed to become the Cowboys' all-time leading rusher. 
They wanted to take control of the division and to get through the 
game with Troy Aikman in one piece. There was too much business to 
take care of to think about retribution. And retribution against whom? 
The Giants? A one-season flash in the pan? A team whose playoff run 
is looking more and more an aberration? The Cowboys' and Giants' seasons 
illustrate the difference between a team with a long view and a team 
with a short view. There is still the possibility of a Giants miracle. 
You heard that word a lot in the Giants locker room after the game. 
More than you would like to hear it in a contending locker room. Except 
that this is no longer a contending locker room; this is a 3-6 locker 
room reduced to hoping for miracles. ``There's still seven games left,'' 
Danny Kanell said. ``We might need a miracle,'' said Kanell, who spoke 
of playing one game at a time, playing for pride and respect and playing 
for the future. In the Giants' locker room Sunday there was no consensus 
on where the team goes from here, what the sixth loss of the season 
meant. Are they now merely playing for pride? Playing for jobs? Are 
they playing for an outside shot at a miracle? Chris Calloway spoke 
of increased scrutiny. ``Everybody's going to be under a microscope 
for the last seven games,'' he said. ``Now it's personal pressure, 
knowing that everybody's watching you, seeing how you're going to 
react; to see if you're going to quit or not.'' Kanell was realistic. 
``If we win the rest of our games,'' he said, ``we still need a miracle.'' 
Howard Cross was optimistic. ``If we mess around and beat Green Bay,'' 
he said, ``and beat a couple of teams, string together a few victories 
in a row. If we win all of them we'll be 10-6 and everyone will be 
asking, `How'd they get in the playoffs?''' The truth is, people are 
asking that now about last year's team. How did a team that was 10-5-1 
last season and came within a point of advancing to the National Football 
Conference semifinals fall to 3-6 this season? You don't get the sense 
that the Giants have fully grasped why they are where they are. How 
did a team with the same players, the same coach, the same scheme, 
come to this? The Giants are the youngest team in the National Football 
League and Fassel is a second-year coach. Last year the Giants were 
eager students for the new headmaster. They studied quickly. They 
were like the kid who hastily sets a up new computer, skips through 
the manual just enough to get the system up and running, and tosses 
the manual away with a confident ``I've got it.'' But the Giants don't 
get it. ``Maybe we got caught up in our success last year, thought 
things were going to come easy,'' Kanell said. ``They didn't.'' Week 
in, week out, the Giants keep making the sort of careless mistakes 
that come from not being familiar with the manual they tossed away. 
Not necessarily the penalties, but the mistakes in execution. Mistakes. 
That's the word you hear repeatedly this season. Week after week, 
the same question: ``What went wrong?'' The same answer: ``Mistakes.'' 
A few of the Giants Sunday, pointing to a silver lining, said they 
had cut down on mistakes. Howard Cross scoffed. ``All you have to 
do,'' he said, ``is make one.'' In the second quarter Sunday, the 
Giants trailed by 6-3, but they had pushed the Cowboys up and down 
the field. Now the Giants faced a second and goal on the Dallas 1-yard 
line. Instead of a big play that resulted in a Giants touchdown, Kanell 
was sacked for a 7-yard loss because someone forgot to pick up a blitzing 
cornerback. In the next five weeks the Giants face three of the league's 
terror teams: Green Bay, San Francisco and Denver. Talk about needing 
a miracle! The Giants play three more games in November, then four 
in December with nothing on the line. ``I've never been in a situation 
where it's pretty much been over at this point,'' Kanell said late 
Sunday afternoon. ``I've always been in contention until the last 
game of the season. It's frustrating.'' Returning to the miracle theme, 
the quarterback added, ``Everybody's down, everybody's discouraged, 
but we're going to try to fight hard and try to make a miracle happen.'' 
Alas. The Giants are out of miracles; turns out they used them all 
last season.
