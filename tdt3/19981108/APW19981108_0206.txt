Kaname Yokoo collected 10 points Sunday for six birdies against two 
bogeys and won his first career victory by three points in the 120 
million yen (dlrs 1.02 million) Acom International golf tournament. 
Yokoo, in his fourth year on the tour, finished the 72 holes with 
a total of 46 points, three ahead of Katsumasa Miyamoto. ``I tried 
to score as many birdies as I can because the point system makes a 
birdie more than enough to offset a bogey,'' said the 26-year-old 
Yokoo. The tournament's modified Stableford scoring system awards 
8 points for a double eagle, 5 for an eagle, 2 for a birdie, zero 
for par, minus-1 for a bogey and minus-3 for a double bogey or worse. 
Yokoo, winner of the 1993 national collegiate championship, was the 
leader throughout the four-day event. He earned 21.6 million yen (dlrs 
180,000), his biggest paycheck so far. Kimpachi Yoshimura and Taisuke 
Kitajima were tied for third at 36 points.
