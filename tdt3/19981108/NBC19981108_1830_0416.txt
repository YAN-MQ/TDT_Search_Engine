In central America, the destruction from hurricane Mitch is only now 
becoming clear and no where is the devastation worse than in Honduras 
where NBC's Kerry Sanders is tonight. Former president jurj bush, 
today touring the country hardest hit by hurricane Mitch. We have 
been moved at the suffering and the people in Honduras. On hurs is 
about the size of Virginia, a quarter of the population is homeless 
tonight. More than 1.5 million refugees. Gone, not only houses, but 
83 of the country's 94 bridges. In only a few cases is it a possible 
to get across the rivers. The president of Honduras says the floods 
set the infrastructure here back 20 years. Today, Honduras looks like 
the aftermath of battle. And in this "war zone," it will take years 
to rebuild bridges. Until then, the short-term solution to connect 
cities and villages will be to use U.S. military "wartime" technology. 
Temporary bridges, like this one installed in Bosnia, are now on the 
way to honduras. Until they're in place, military helicopters will 
supply food and water. It's going to take a long time. There's a lot 
of devastation out there, and we're here for as long as they need 
us. We're ready for it. Small villages remain cut off. The only road 
in or out of monolica is gone. Only two relief helicopters made it 
to monolica this week -- 7,000 survivors cut off from civilization. 
77-year-old florentina Garcia -- homeless, unsure if her weak heart 
can withstand the trauma. The homeless are also jobless. Two-thirds 
of the population works in agriculture, but the rains destroyed 80% 
of the country's crops. The Cruz family lost its entire coffee plantation. 
The economy, the national economy is destroyed completely. Honduras 
tonight -- a country crippled, but fighting -- with help -- To survive. 
Kerry Sanders, NBC news, tegucigalpa, Honduras.
