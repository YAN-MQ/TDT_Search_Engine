German prostitutes should get a legal right to jobless, health and 
retirement benefits, the new government's minister for women was quoted 
as saying. ``We have a draft law, we only need to introduce it in 
parliament,'' Christine Bergmann told the newsweekly Der Spiegel in 
its new edition published Sunday. Under German law, prostitutes are 
required to pay taxes but can't claim the social welfare state's generous 
benefits. Prostitutes should also get the right to sue customers who 
don't pay, Bergmann told the magazine. A Social Democrat like Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder, Bergmann is promoting a more liberal line on women's 
rights and family issues than the previous center-right government 
under Helmut Kohl. She called for a ban on pornography that shows 
violent or ``sexually demeaning'' acts against women and children. 
``I consider it an important signal that society says: We won't tolerate 
this,'' she told Der Spiegel.
