The world's oldest astronaut says he feels great one day after returning 
from space. Today, John Glenn and the six other crew members of space 
shuttle "Discovery" talked about their nine days in orbit. Glenn says 
he slept well last night and that his body is about 90% to 95% adapted 
to gravity. During the mission, 77-year-old Glenn served as a Guinea 
pig for a round of tests on the effects of weightlessness on the elderly. 
He was asked what the future holds for him. I have a very definite 
obligation, having been given this opportunity to participate again, 
to participate in all the follow-up and make sure that we get all 
the information and data that we were collecting. Make sure that whatever 
my part of that data and analysis is and collection and follow-up 
that I do the best job that I can. As far as beyond that, I don't 
know. We haven't talked to NASA about follow-up relationships or anything 
like that. I have no idea what may be in mind in that. Glenn says 
he didn't feel all that well yesterday just after landing. He says 
he was stiff at the time, and even now can't turn his head quickly 
without getting a little disoriented.
