Asia's economic crisis has not robbed ordinary people of the ability 
to laugh. In Thailand, the sound of fun has been turned into a contest. 
Sanjay Singh reports. The economic crisis in Thailand isn't funny 
-- -- but laughing it off isn't a bad idea. In this economic climate, 
I feel better when I laugh. The ripley's believe it or not museum 
thought other Thais would feel the same way, so the museum organized 
a contest to find the country's funniest laugh. In Asia today, there's 
not a lot to laugh about, so we thought this would be a lighthearted, 
fun, family-oriented way to do it. And the organizers had no trouble 
attracting contestants. When I saw the advertisement for 24 contest 
I thought it was funny, and I laughed at that, too. And it wasn't 
just Thais looking for a good laugh. I have been tofestivelies and 
fairs all over the world. I love a party situation. In all, 15 contestants 
entered the contest. They were rated on the loudness of the laugh. 
And in the end, a 54-year-old housewife walked away with the first 
prize. She laughed -- and laughed -- for nine minutes straight -- 
and didn't even stop when she was led offstage. She probably laughed 
all the way to the bank, where she cashed her check for $280. That 
was the first prize. Sanjay Singh, CNN.
