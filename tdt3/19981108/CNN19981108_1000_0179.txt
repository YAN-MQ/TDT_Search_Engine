As republicans vie for house leadership, democrats are wasting no 
time seizing the high ground on Capitol Hill. Kathleen Koch reports. 
Education, health care and social security -- some of the many issues 
in the Clinton agenda that political observers say have a better chance 
of success with the weakened republican majority in Congress. It gains 
impetus for a couple of reasons. Number one, some democrats who may 
have been in opposition to his program or to various parts of his 
program will tend to come in line and rally behind him at this point. 
And it may also be more appealing to more moderate republicans. But 
republicans insist they will be able to pull together and control 
the agenda, though their majority in the house has been cut to six 
and their speaker has quit. I believe that in shaping the new agenda, 
we are going to have to adopt a Participative management style. There's 
a lot of very, very wonderful people in the republican conference, 
and I think collectively, as a team, we need to come up with an approach. 
This is not a problem. This is not a crisis. This is an opportunity. 
But it is democrats who are already seizing the opportunity. The president, 
trying to extend the Brady law requiring background checks of handgun 
purchasers, which some republicans have tried to water down. In his 
Saturday radio address, President Clinton said he wants such checks 
required at gun shows, which are currently exempt from the law. Some 
of these gun shows have become illegal arms bazaars for criminals 
and gun traffickers looking to buy and sell guns on a cash-and-carry, 
no-questions-asked basis. So the president is already firing shots 
on divisive issues. And with a greater foothold than they've had in 
years, democrats on the hill will be pushing and testing, knowing 
that it won't take much for them to gain the upper hand. Kathleen 
Koch, for CNN, the White House.
