Goodvening. A new poll from ABC News shows Americans will not miss 
Newt ginich. 70% approve of his dision to step down as speaker of 
the house. And 90% say his successor should try harder to work with 
the democrats instead of agast them. The men now competing for gingri's 
job are likely to be listening very closely. Here's ABC's Karla Davis. 
Today, congressional republics are calling Newt ginich "A visiony" 
and "A dear friend," while prying the gavel out of the resigning speak's 
hand before his body gets CD. He is a revolutionary. I am a manager. 
There are two different types of leadership. And I hope that mine 
will be what we need to project the republican party into the futur 
eporter: On ABC's "this we," appropriations committee chairman Bob 
livingstosaid he had more than 100 of the 112 votes he needs to become 
E new speaker of the house. But he does have a challenger inhe younger, 
more conservative representative, Christopher Cox. People wish to 
see Congress put policies ahead of polics, policies aheadf personalities. 
Republicans say that's the message voters sent Congress on Tuesday, 
when democrats gained five seats the house and shattered the GOP's 
expectatio of increasintheir majority. Those results sealed Gingrich's 
fate, anhis colleagues are poised to pick a New leader on November 
18th. Democrats welcome the ange, as well. Well, my job is to work 
with whoever T republicans want to be their leaders. Hope we can work 
together better than we have in the pt. Gingrich's combative approach 
helped fuel four years of partisan bickering. Past cshes with democrats 
led to the 1995 government shutdown and to this year's tumultuous 
budget negotiations. Girich took the blame then and is blamed now 
for this elecon's anti-Clinton campaign ads that backfired. Republans 
want to stop E hemorrhaging and start fashioning a more voter-friely 
image bere the next elections in the yr 2000. Karla Davis, ABC News,
