Republicans are trying to figure out their next move now that house 
speaker newt Gingrich is leaving Capitol Hill. Yesterday, Gingrich 
said aside from resigning as house speaker, he would also give up 
his congressional seat. The decision came after the GOP's poor congressional 
showing in Tuesday's midterm elections. Democratic house minority 
leader Richard Gephardt says he believes republicans should focus 
on the needs of the American people. So far, two republicans are eyeing 
the house leadership -- congressman Bob livingston of Louisiana and 
Christopher Cox of California. I think Bob Livingston is a great leader, 
and Bob Livingston would make a Great speaker. I'm not running against 
Bob Livingston. I'm running for speaker. I can promise that as speaker, 
I will put policies first. One of the reasons that we did not capitalize 
on the upside opportunities that we enjoyed in the last election is 
that we did not run on our ideas. I am worried that with this leadership 
fight on the republican side, that this whole thing will get extended 
into next year, which would be particularly unfortunate. We need to 
get it over with, so we can get to the issues that people really care 
about, health care, education, social security those are the issues 
we ought to be worrying about. Republican congressman Steve Largent 
is challenging house majority leader dick Armey. Today, he said the 
party has suffered from a vacuum leadership with no coherent agenda.
