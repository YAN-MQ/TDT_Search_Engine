Namibian President Sam Nujoma demanded that Botswana return a group 
of 130 alleged rebels to Namibia, where they would stand trial for 
high treason and murder. In a state of the nation address broadcast 
Saturday on national television and radio, Nujoma said the group was 
headed by a former opposition leader, Mishake Muyongo, and advocated 
secession for a panhandle area in northeast Namibia called the Caprivi 
strip. ``They have committed a serious act of treason and coldblooded 
murder in the Republic of Namibia,'' said Nujoma. ``We will make them 
pay for this.'' The group fled to Botswana about ten days ago, where 
members are being held on charges of illegally crossing the border 
and carrying arms of war. They have applied for political asylum. 
Nujoma accused the group of launching an armed rebellion and murdering 
one of their supporters who wanted to back out of the secessionist 
pact. Botswana is holding group in Kasane, a northern border town, 
where they are expected to appear in court later this week. The Botswana 
office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
is considering their application for refugee status. According to 
Namibian media reports last week, the group includes Caprivi's regional 
governor, John Mabuku, teachers and school children. They were carrying 
rocket propelled grenades, mortar bombs and mortar launchers, the 
reports said. The 400-kilometer (240-mile) long Caprivi strip, home 
to about 110,000 people, borders with Angola, Botswana, Zambia and 
Zimbabwe. Prior to Namibian independence in 1990, it was administered 
by a string of outside rulers that included Zambia, Botswana and South 
Africa.
