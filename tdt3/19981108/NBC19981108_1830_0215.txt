This mission will give NASA information about older people in space, 
but already, sky-high science is helping many of us Earthlings. NBC's 
Dan Lothian explains. a doctor uses laser technology first developed 
to see into space to permanently cure Janice lessin's nearsightedness. 
The medicine we do now is close to "star trek" medicine. We're almost 
to the point where we can correct a patient without touching them. 
And keep their hearts beating, opening blocked arteries with angioplasty 
treatment born from NASA's research of the earth's atmosphere. These 
are extremely exciting times, the field is exploding. From quick and 
easy infrared thermometers, to a cool suit for heat-sensitive children, 
similar to those worn by astronauts, the race into space created many 
giant steps for mankind. So far at least 1,200 so-called "spinoffs." 
We reach for the stars in developing incredible technologies to improve 
intellectual capacity of the country, and the same time, it touches 
everybody's life. Like the GPs system which helps motorists find their 
way. And the anti-scratch lenses. And anti-fog goggles, which aid 
vision. This startup Kentucky company makes pillows and mattresses 
that ease sleep disorders and prevent bed sores. They're using a foam 
material designed to cushion astronauts. Even on a golf course, NASA 
technology makes it a lot easier to sink a Putt. This putter comes 
with a special alloy insert, made from similar materials studied for 
use in the space station. It allows more control and spin on the ball. 
And a joystick that puts you in the cyberdriver's seat, before steered 
real space flights. Secondary benefits from a multibillion-dollar 
program, always trying to convince the public that space exploration 
pays. Dan Lothian, NBC news, Los Angeles.
