Iraq is showing no signs of backing down, even with the looming threat 
of military action. Jane arraf reports. At U.N. headquarters, at the 
heart of the standoff, nuclear monitors went out Sunday, but other 
inspections remained stalled. UNSCOM said it would send home over 
the next few days about two dozen inspectors who have been idled, 
but was still keeping about 100 members of the team on standby. We 
maintain the capacity to go out at very short notice to resume our 
activities, so it means we could start our work again, should it be 
necessary. That's the optimistic scenario -- that Iraq will change 
its mind about lifting its ban on cooperation. The U.N.'s special 
envoy for Iraq is hoping a flurry of diplomatic efforts could defuse 
the gathering military threat. Let's talk about the security council 
resolution that has just been passed and its implementation. Meanwhile, 
Iraq kept up its political offensive, saying nothing the U.S. and 
its allies could do would be worse than what it's been through already. 
I don't think a military strike would kill 60,000 children as sanctions 
are killing now, and have killed more than 1.5 million Iraqis. Not 
even France nor Russia, usually sympathetic to Iraq, have escaped 
Baghdad's criticism. But one sympathetic ear, former Irish prime minister 
Albert Reynolds, who arrived in Baghdad to highlight the effect of 
sanctions. Reynolds met with Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz 
this morning and said he found him flexible and open. But that's the 
same meeting in which Aziz officially rejected the latest security 
council demand -- a sign, perhaps, that despite Iraq's tough public 
talk, they may still be looking for a way out. Jane arraf, CNN, Baghdad.
