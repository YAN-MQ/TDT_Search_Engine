At midcareer and middle age, Stephen King is a restless member of 
the magic circle of best-sellerati, the exclusive elite of commercial 
authors whose pricey prose can pay for a football team or pad a publishing 
house's bottom line. His latest novel of haunted love, ``Bag of Bones'' 
(Scribner), may occupy the prime real estate of best-seller lists 
and his new publishing partnership appears to be a blissful business 
marriage. But King is not entirely satisfied. He wants more. Readers, 
that is. There are the lapsed female fans who, focus groups indicate, 
have tiptoed away from his brand of horror for tales such as the ``vampire 
lit'' of Anne Rice that King dismisses as soft-core pornography. Then 
there are the up-market customers who have shunned him like ``Carrie,'' 
or the potential readers that know him only from plot twists in films 
and television movies. ``This is psychological,'' explained King, 
whose quest for more readers gives him the zeal at times of a director 
of marketing. ``I would like to sell. I wanted to have one more book 
that was big, that felt like I was running the tables in terms of 
sales. I wanted to knock Tom Clancy out of the number-one spot. Like 
Leonardo DiCaprio, I'm king of the world, even if it's only for two 
weeks, whatever. I wanted those things.'' At 51, with library shelves 
of best-selling books in his name and pen-names, King is aggressively 
confronting the arc of his long career, a line that the writer character 
in ``Bag of Bones'' gratefully remarks is ``longer for novelists because 
readers are a little brighter than fans of the non-written arts and 
thus have marginally longer memories.'' Today his newest title clings 
to the upper tiers of best-seller lists, but his opening sales do 
not compare with some of his rivals, including new authors seeking 
to enter that preserve. And while more than 20 of his books have climbed 
the rungs of the New York Times best-seller lists, King's newer titles 
spend less time there. In its crucial debut week in late September, 
``Bag of Bones,'' for instance, sold in numbers at the Barnes &AMP; 
Noble chain that were a third of the opening sales for Tom Clancy's 
``Rainbow Six'' (Putnam) or half of those for Robert Jordan's ``Path 
of Daggers'' (Tor/Doherty), which nudged ``Bag of Bones'' out of No. 
1. Just a year ago, King parted with his newly merged publisher, Viking, 
and started a very awkward public search for a new literary home amid 
sniping in publishing circles that the author had passed his prime. 
His sales, the critics felt, were too flat to justify the almost $18 
million advance he initially demanded for the ``Bag of Bones'' manuscript. 
Ultimately, the courting rituals with various publishers ended in 
a unique profit-sharing partnership with Simon &AMP; Schuster, the 
unit of Viacom which paid him a $2 million advance against profits 
for each title in a three-book deal plus a share of the profits of 
more than 50 percent. Since then, King has expanded that arrangement 
to include two more books and he speaks of his new publishing house 
like a satisfied groom _ one who is even more elated because he is 
rid of his first wife. The lack of an enormous advance gives both 
sides more freedom, according to King. ``You become a partner in how 
the book does and you're not expecting somebody to take the fall if 
the book does badly,'' he said. ``The problem with the big advance 
today, particularly for a writer who has sold as well as I have in 
the past, is that it says to the publisher that `all I'm doing is 
taking out flop insurance.''' So far, the author is so content with 
the partnership that he describes it as a ``honeymoon cruise'' with 
executives at his new imprint, Scribner, who ``make me feel like I'm 
35.'' In contrast, he said, in his ``marriage with Viking, I played 
the woman's part. I felt like the little housewife who stays home 
and works all day, while my husband is out taking all the credit and 
sporting around town in his nice tailored suit. And I felt that I 
wasn't being respected and I was being taken for granted.'' With the 
merger of Viking's parent into the Penguin Putnam Group, King said 
he felt he was caught in a power struggle between top executives in 
the different companies. Putnam, he said, already had megaselling 
authors like Tom Clancy and Patricia Cornwell. ``Clancy sells more 
copies than I do and Phyllis Grann is their rabbi, simple as that,'' 
he said, referring to Penguin Putnam's president, who makes bit appearances 
in ``Bag of Bones'' as a doting publisher willing to help the novelist 
protagonist ``with almost any concern.'' Ms. Grann declined to comment 
on the past negotiations. Several associates of King with knowledge 
of those talks, though, said the company did make serious efforts 
to keep him; one person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
King was nervous that the publishing house had become ``Tom Clancy's 
company and he had this incredible competition with Clancy.'' Now 
King and his new partner, Simon &AMP; Schuster, have settled on a 
strategy to try to increase his sales _ which had seemed to reach 
a plateau of less than 1.3 million copies _ by seeking lapsed readers 
through appeals promoting the writing quality in ``Bag of Bones'' 
or highlighting its romance elements. Focus groups, a rarely used 
expensive research tool in the publishing industry, met for four nights 
to analyze the ``Bag of Bones'' manuscript and to discuss what makes 
readers run to buy Stephen King books or to bolt in the opposite direction. 
``It was clear that a lot of people who had fallen away were women,'' 
King said of the research results that, he added, did not affect the 
book's editing. ``A lot of them felt that I was writing strictly horror 
stories and I knew that wasn't true. And I've always been a little 
shy about saying, `Now, wait a minute, I'm a lot more than just a 
horror writer' because it sounds so conceited.''' That became the 
task of Scribner's publisher, Susan Moldow, who personally promoted 
the title among booksellers in places like Michigan and Alabama in 
the hopes that the book would reach new readers through positive word-of-mouth 
reviews from bookstore employees. It was her view that many people 
knew King's work through movies or television series, but, surprisingly, 
not through his own words. ``The best way to address that is to get 
as many people as possible to read him,'' she said. So she sent personal 
notes to many of her personal contacts in bookstores, pointing out 
that ``any woman who has proved susceptible to the charms of `Rebecca''' 
would be intrigued by King's ``surprising update of Daphne du Maurier's 
world of festering secrets.'' The company's executives worked with 
large discount chains like Wal-Mart Stores and Costco's Price Club 
to develop special displays and a special collector's edition of a 
Stephen King magazine. Viacom offered billboard space to promote the 
book and television commercials in its Blockbuster video stores. With 
a bigger stake in the deal, King made more of a personal effort to 
promote the book, submitting to a rare publicity tour and the questions 
of late-night talk-show hosts and reporters _ a process that his novelist 
hero in ``Bag of Bones'' compares to being sushi at a sushi bar. Though 
he does not say it himself, King's longtime personal editor, Charles 
Verrill, said the author considers his new novel one of the best of 
the more than 40 he has written. The book's plot centers on a popular 
author who develops a severe case of writer's block in the aftermath 
of his wife's death. After years of literary drought, the writer retreats 
to his vacation home in western Maine where he encounters ghosts and 
romance with a young mother caught in a child-custody struggle with 
her wealthy father-in-law. ``I think the fact that he loves this book 
had a great deal to do with the failure of negotiations. He finished 
the book as he turned 50,'' Verrill said, referring to the negotiations 
with Penguin Putnam. ``I think that psychologically he was offered 
a little bit less for a novel that he loved so dearly and, at this 
point in his career, it came as a kind of wound or blow. Money was 
the language. Money was the gesture and the gesture came as a blow.'' 
But expanding King's base is in some ways a delicate task. By emphasizing 
romance elements, the publisher also risks turning off loyal readers 
who are drawn to King's work for plots stressing horror and the supernatural. 
``I'm not really sure this is the real Stephen King or is this a mask 
that he's putting on for this particular book,'' said Jim Farrelly, 
a professor of English at the University of Dayton who had been teaching 
courses featuring King's books for almost as long as King's career. 
``I'm really convinced that I'm not going to teach it in my class. 
The romance is really like going back to soft-core horror instead 
of hard-core horror.'' Thus far the effort to reach new readers has 
had mixed results, though the publishers say they have shipped out 
more than 1.55 million copies, an increase from the past. Though the 
publisher was clearly trying to reach up-market customers, King's 
new novel has actually shown the most growth in the large discount 
chains like Wal-Mart or Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target chain. Still, 
the Borders bookstore chain, which draws an older, affluent base of 
customers, also reports that King's sales have grown with this book, 
and Ms. Muldow said sales are obviously up in online bookstores, a 
sales outlet that didn't exist 19 years ago when King had his first 
best seller, ``The Dead Zone.'' Sales, though, have remained average 
at mall stores, which draw younger, more impulsive buyers. ``My feeling 
is that it could sell better than anything I've done in years,'' said 
King, who at times sounds very much like the novelist protagonist 
in his new book. ``I've been in this business for 25 years and there 
is an arc. It's a lot slower for novelists than it is for comics and 
singers and I'm grateful for that.''
