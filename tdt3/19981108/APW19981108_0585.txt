An ethnic Albanian guerrilla on Sunday called the killings of five 
uniformed rebels by police a violation of Kosovo's de facto cease 
fire and police Serb police searched for a second day for two missing 
officers. Sebajdin Cena, who described himself as the Kosovo Liberation 
Army doctor at its regional headquarters in Retinje village, said 
one of the victims was commander of two brigades in the region. The 
five died Friday on a road near Opterusa in central Kosovo. Police 
described the encounter as a shootout and said the uniformed KLA guerrillas 
fired first, and foreign observers reported a similar account. But 
Cena said police ambushed the two cars the rebels were driving and 
that the KLA victims never fired a shot. He said two others in the 
car were wounded and managed to crawl to safety, and other KLA fighters 
exchanged gunfire with the police after the initial ambush. ``There 
is no logic saying the KLA got out of the car and shot at an armored 
vehicle. The truth is that the police shot at them,'' Cena said. ``We 
consider it a violation of the cease-fire.'' According to Cena, the 
dead included Gjelal Hajda, 31, commander of two KLA brigades in the 
region, and his assistant, Selajdin Mullabazi, 29, along with three 
fighters. He said the international community ``should put more pressure 
on Serbs because the violence could spread.'' ``Whenever the police 
attack Albanian villages, we are not going to wait to tell them to 
go back. We are going to use force,'' he said. On the same day the 
Albanians were killed, two Serbian police officers Dejan Djatlov, 
23, and Ilija Vujosevic, 48, disappeared while distributing food to 
remote police checkpoints some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest 
of province's capital Pristina, the Serb Media Center reported. The 
two may have been abducted by the KLA, possibly in retaliation for 
the killing of the five KLA guerrillas, Serb sources said. They are 
the latest of a few dozen Serb policemen to go missing since the start 
of a Serb crackdown on Albanian separatists in February. Since then, 
several hundred people _ including more than 100 police _ have been 
killed and up to 300,000 driven from their homes. Violence in predominately 
ethnic Albanian Kosovo flared anew this past week, despite the de-facto 
peace treaty designed to end bloodshed in the turbulent province and 
set the stage for a political agreement between Serb authorities and 
Albanian leaders. The Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was reached under 
the threat of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslav and Serb forces in the region. 
The Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement calls for setting up a 2,000 strong 
verification mission of unarmed observers run by the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until it begins operating, 
unlikely before next month, a previous observer mission started in 
July will continue to operate patrols throughout Kosovo.
