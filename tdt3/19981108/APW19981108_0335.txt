Serbian police searched for a second day Sunday for two officers who 
missing from southwestern Kosovo province, Serb sources said. Dejan 
Djatlov, 23, and Ilija Vujosevic, 48, have been missing since late 
Friday. Serb sources said they were abducted by separatist ethnic 
Albanian guerrillas who have gained ground in parts of the contested 
Serbian province since the police and federal army forces were scaled 
down under international pressure last month. Also Friday, five ethnic 
Albanian armed guerrillas died in a shoot-out with Serbian police, 
also in southwestern Kosovo. The Albanians were to be buried in their 
home villages Sunday. It was unclear if the incidents were linked. 
According to the Serb-run Media Center, the two officers were distributing 
food to remote police checkpoints some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest 
of province's capital Pristina, when they disappeared. The two are 
the latest among several dozen Serbian police officers to disappear 
since fighting escalated last February. Since then several hundred 
people _ including more than 100 police _ have been killed and up 
to 300,000 driven from their homes. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, 
the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation. Violence in predominately 
ethnic Albanian Kosovo has flared anew this past week, despite a de-facto 
peace treaty designed to end bloodshed in the turbulent province and 
set the stage for a political agreement between Serb authorities and 
Albanian leaders. The Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke calls for setting 
up a verification mission of 2,000 unarmed observers run by the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until it begins operating, 
unlikely before next month, a previous observer mission started in 
July will continue to patrol Kosovo. Members of the mission, along 
with international officials in the province, say despite last week's 
incidents, the overall situation has improved considerably since the 
deal was signed. The deal envisages returning virtual autonomy to 
Kosovo's Albanians, while keeping the province within Yugoslavia. 
On Saturday, Kosovo Serbs protested against the possible political 
deal, saying it would result in Milosevic effectively handing Kosovo 
to the ethnic Albanians.
