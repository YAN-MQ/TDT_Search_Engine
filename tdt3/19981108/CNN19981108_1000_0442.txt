A research team in Pasadena, California, is getting help from a local 
hospital in its investigation into prehistoric life on earth. The 
team is using the hospital's ct scanner to X-Ray fossilized dinosaur 
eggs found in China. The researchers were surprised to find the undisturbed 
fetus of a baby dinosaur in one of the eggs. Visually, when you cut 
open an egg, you don't see any of this. Maybe a little bit of foetal 
bone representated. And you see minerals that are almost similar to 
the minerals outside of the egg, which tells you that to the unaided 
eye you've got nothing. And when it appears that you've got nothing, 
you feel free to go ahead and ravage through whatever it is in the 
egg that you want to get to, to get to the prize. And up until this, 
the prize has always been fetal bone. Now it's life. now it's dna. 
Now it's bacteria. Now it's structure. The researchers say they're 
delighted with their finding, but are a little disappointed that a 
tyrannosaurus Rex egg they examined turned out to be empty.
