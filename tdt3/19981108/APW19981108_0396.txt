After a week of melees involving illegal immigrants seeking a limited 
number of work permits under a one-time offer, Italy's interior minister 
has indicated Rome might let more people stay after all. ``Whoever 
meets the requirements of the law won't be expelled,'' Minister Rosa 
Russo Jervolino said in an interview published Sunday in La Repubblica. 
``Just how those who go above the limit will be absorbed will be studied 
in the next few days,'' she added. There are an estimated 200,000-250,000 
illegal immigrants in Italy. Under an amnesty, immigrants have till 
Dec. 15 to apply for some 38,000 permits that the government said 
will be granted to those who can prove they have a job and have been 
in the country since before March, when Italy tightened its rules 
on illegal immigrants. Rome promised its northern EU allies that it 
would expel all those who don't have jobs in Italy or who aren't eligible 
for political asylum. Many of the clandestine immigrants travel through 
Italy to reach relatives or black-market jobs in northern Europe. 
Last week, some immigrants fainted and others scuffled with police 
after they waited in line for hours outside police stations after 
authorities started taking applications on Nov. 4. Paperwork has overwhelmed 
officials. Some immigrants who can't prove they were in the country 
before March applied anyway, in hopes they somehow would be allowed 
to stay. At least 17,000 immigrants have come to Italy illegally since 
the beginning of the year. Most are brought by smugglers in rickety 
boats or take to motorized dinghies to cross the Adriatic between 
Italy and Albania or the waters between Sicily and northern Africa. 
On Saturday, more than 500 illegal immigrants turned up off the coast 
of Puglia, in southeastern Italy. One of the boats had been abandoned 
for days by smugglers. Immigrants have been coming in waves for several 
years now, making the journey on nights when seas are calm.
