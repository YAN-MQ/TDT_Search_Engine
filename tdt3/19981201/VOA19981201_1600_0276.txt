The Rwandan government has released 76 genocide suspects for lack 
of evidence. The government says the files of those released Tuesday 
had either been lost or did not support a charge of taking part in 
the 1994 massacres with Tutsis and moderates Hutus. Former prisoners 
have been held at a prison in rural Tugali.
