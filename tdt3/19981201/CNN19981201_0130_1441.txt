The FBI paid a special visit to Peru's embassy in Washington Monday. 
It returned a gold crown believed to be almost 3,000 years old. The 
silver-colored headdress was smuggled out of Latin America and retrieved 
by the FBI in an undercover operation in Miami four years ago. It 
will be displayed temporarily at the embassy's museum, before returning 
to Peru.
