If you have an "icy rider" toboggan, you may want to take it back. 
Rubbermaid is recalling 60,000 of them -- the ones with model number 
2108. The company says the front of the toboggan can break away during 
a ride. It's made of purple plastic, with a yellow rope. If you own 
one of these toboggans, contact rubbermaid for a replacement.
