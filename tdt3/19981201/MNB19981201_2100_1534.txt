Time for a look at the weather across the country. We go to WNBC-television 
in New York and meteorologist Janice huff. We'll be lighting our own 
tree in Rockefeller plaza tomorrow. There's going to be a network 
broadcast of that at 8:00 P.M. eastern time. We hope you get to watch 
it on TV. It's going to be great.
