Vice President Al Gore isn't officially running for president yet, 
but he reportedly already is putting together a campaign team for 
2000. Democratic sources close to Gore say he has appointed White 
House political director Craig Smith to run the day-to-day operations 
of a campaign. Gore is expected to make his candidacy official early 
next year.
