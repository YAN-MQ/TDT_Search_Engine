Merger or no, low oil prices hurt oil company stocks. Exxon and mobil 
were particularly hard-hit. The Dow was down for much of the day but 
it turned around and closed up by the end of the day. It was a big 
rally for the NASDAQ. It was up more than 54 points today, gaining 
back most of it lost in yesterday's selloff.
