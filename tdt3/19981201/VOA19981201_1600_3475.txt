An Olympic champion ice skater has left her native Russia for Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania. Elena Balova won the gold medal for pairs skating in 
the 1984 Olympics and the silver in 1988. She was offered about $100 
a month to coach in Russia. Ms. Balova is 35 years old, married, and 
has a two-year-old son. She says could not afford to support her family 
on the Russian salary. In Pittsburgh, she has signed a three-year 
contract to become assistant director of skating at the Islands Sport 
Center. She could earn there more than $100,000 per year, quite a 
difference.
