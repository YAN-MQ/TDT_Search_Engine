Police on Thursday raided a shop selling hemp merchandise in the latest 
step in a crackdown on stores selling items from the European Union-subsidized 
crop. Police also detained the shop owner, Yuli Kalofolia, and were 
to charge her on felony counts of advertsing and promoting drug use 
for profit. The charges stemmed from the five-leaf marijuana emblem 
found on some clothes stocked by the store.
