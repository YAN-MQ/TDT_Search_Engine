President Clinton and Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif have 
held talks on reducing the threat of nuclear confrontation in South 
Asia. The United States is also pressing Pakistan to help bring to 
justice the man believed to be behind the deadly bombings of two U.S. 
embassies in Africa last August. VOA's Nick Simeone has more from 
the White House. After his talks with the president, Prime Minister 
Sharif told reporters reducing tensions with neighboring India has 
only been possible with outside mediation. He suggested the United 
States step in fearing India is preparing to test another nuclear 
device. I hope they don't do it. There are fears and the information 
that we have received is that they are making preparations. But I 
hope they don't do it because that will further aggravate the situation 
in South Asia. The United States imposed sanctions on India and Pakistan 
after their back-to-back nuclear tests in May. Most have now been 
waived with the Clinton administration citing progress the two countries 
have made on nuclear restraint. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
Carl Inderford. We are urging restraint, and we believe that both 
countries are looking very carefully at what next steps they may take. 
And clearly, deployment is one we do not want to see. They understand 
that, and we do not believe they have deployed. President Clinton 
postponed a trip to both India and Pakistan earlier this year because 
of their nuclear tests. But with both countries pledging a moratorium, 
the president says he is hoping to reschedule the trip next year.
