Scientists have discovered why some people who are infected with the 
AIDS virus have a rapid downhill course, becoming gravely ill and 
dying within a few years, while most infected people live for years 
without major symptoms. The key is a gene that acts like a molecular 
rheostat, turning up or down the activity of another gene that produces 
a protein the AIDS virus uses as a doorway to enter cells. A normal 
variant of the rheostat gene turns out to accelerate the onslaught 
of the AIDS virus in about a fifth of people whose HIV infection progresses 
rapidly. About one person in 10 has the gene variant, which is described 
in a report in Friday's issue of the journal Science. As a result, 
said Dr. Stephen J. O'Brien, the head of the group that discovered 
the gene's effect, ``if they get infected with HIV, they'll go fast.'' 
O'Brien is chief of the laboratory of genomic diversity at the National 
Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md. Scientists say the discovery might 
help them devise treatment strategies, but not actual treatments for 
HIV. O'Brien said the discovery's immediate importance was in evaluating 
AIDS vaccines, because it was important to know a group's genetic 
susceptibility in deciding if a vaccine slowed the course of the disease. 
But, researchers say, the result is most significant as a harbinger 
of the future of disease research. It fleshes out a picture of HIV 
infections that illustrates how a gene that appears to have no obvious 
relationship to a disease can determine the outcome of the complex 
battle between the body, with all its cells and organs, and a disease. 
``AIDS is leading the way,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Doctors treating 
AIDS patients have long been interested in the unpredictable nature 
of the disease. While, on average, the time from infection with HIV 
to disease is about 10 years, there are people at either end of a 
wide spectrum. ``People with HIV come to the clinic and could live 
for more than 15 years and be healthier than you or I,'' said Dr. 
Sunil Ahuja, an AIDS researcher at the University of Texas Health 
Science Center in San Antonio. Or, he said, ``they could die two or 
three years later.'' With just a few years of concentrated effort, 
AIDS researchers have discovered genetic variations that normally 
have no consequence, yet can cause the most striking features of infections 
with HIV First they found genes that act like ``a molecular condom,'' 
Ahuja said, protecting people from becoming infected. Then they found 
genes that determine whether people who are infected will be long-term 
survivors, those lucky 5 percent of infected people who go for more 
than 15 years without becoming ill. Now they have a gene that puts 
people at the other end of the spectrum, making them quickly succumb 
to HIV. And soon to appear, one group says, is research showing a 
gene that determines whether an infected woman will pass on HIV to 
her fetus.
