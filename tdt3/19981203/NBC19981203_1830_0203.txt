Adding to the unconventional weather patterns -- the impact of the 
spreading urban areas of America, modern building materials and fooling 
mother nature. NBC's Robert Hager has more on that. If it stays as 
warm as it's been, a prediction from the man who heads national ocenographic 
and atomospheric administration, James Baker. This year, 1998 is going 
to be the warmest year on record, for 500 years. And could it be our 
cities are contributing? To find out, the space agency NASA sends 
a lear jet over urban areas, takes one set of pictures with a normal 
camera and another in infra red, showing the hottest places below 
in bright reds. Sacramento, where the pictures find a vast 50 degrees 
difference between hot buildings and streets and nearby areas with 
trees. Salt Lake City, where it's found some rooftops get as hot as 
160 degrees. City planners may actually use this information to hold 
down temperatures by planting trees to keep the snow cold and deep, 
near sites for the 2002 winter Olympics. And in Baton Rouge, signs 
of more urban heat. How the asphalt, tar, concrete, and metal of every 
city, the roadways, sidewalks, even car tops, all magnify the heat. 
And NASA scientists also found that heat builds all day to create 
a big bubble of hot air over most cities that lingers after dark. 
A key researcher on the project, the space agency's Dale quattrocci. 
There's this dome of elevated air temperatures that presides over 
cities, say three to four hours after sunset. And it's actually been 
seen where we can see where cities are, oh, five to even ten degrees 
more than the surrounding, rural countryside. In Atlanta, the scientists 
find the extra heat actually changes storm patterns, driving rain 
away into the suburbs. As the city got hotter, there actually was 
more rain that was falling downwind of the city, which can have profound 
effects on people living downwind of the city. On a day when temperature 
records fall, more evidence man is part of a problem that is only 
getting worse. Robert Hager, NBC news, cape Canaveral.
