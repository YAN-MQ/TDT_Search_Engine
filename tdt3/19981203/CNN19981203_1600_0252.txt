The space station is a controversial and risky project for NASA. Miles 
O'Brien looks at why some scientists think it is a monumental mistake. 
Larger and more complex than anything ever to fly in space. More expensive 
than any scientific project in history. Look, up in the sky -- it's 
the international space station. But why are 16 nations attempting 
this superhuman endeavor? We need this space station, because if we 
are ever going to live anywhere besides on earth, this is our step 
to doing that. But at what cost? One government accounting office 
estimates the U.S. Bill for construction and operation of the space 
station over 15 years will approach $100 billion, much to the dismay 
of many scientists. Right now, the space station stands as the single 
greatest obstacle to the exploration of the solar system, and that's 
sort of sad. Physicist Robert park believes NASA should still shoot 
for the stars, but leave the humans behind. For a fraction of the 
cost of a space station, we can send armies of robots to Mars and 
find out if there is a reason to send a human being. The question 
of whether the space station is worth it really depends on why you're 
doing it. As a foreign policy initiative, to keep Russian rocket scientists 
in Russia and out of north Korea, it's a bargain at the price. If 
you think it's just a science project, though, it's a tremendous boondoggle 
and ought to be canceled immediately. While the debate rages on, so, 
too, does the construction. 80% of the U.S. hardware is now complete. 
Anybody who goes to Kennedy space center right now and looks at the 
hardware that's sitting in line, ready to go into space or close to 
being ready to go into space, stopping it now would also be a tremendous 
waste. But is it good money after bad? The two most important reasons 
to build the space station are for science and for exploration. We're 
never going anywhere if we can't get off the planet. Wherever the 
space station takes NASA, it is clearly where the space shuttle fleet 
is headed for the foreseeable future. 80% of future shuttle missions 
are now slated for space station construction. When it is completed, 
NASA hopes it will be a shiny new star in the sky. Its critics wonder 
if it will be a budgetary black hole. Miles O'Brien, CNN, at the Kennedy 
space center, Florida.
