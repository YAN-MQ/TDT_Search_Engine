Trans-Atlantic trade relations took a turn for the worse Thursday 
with the European Union calling U.S. demands over a banana dispute 
``ridiculous,'' and warning Washington's threat of sanctions bodes 
ill for next year's world trade negotiations. Chief EU trade negotiator 
Leon Brittan appealed to U.S. authorities to reconsider an European 
proposal to settle the banana dispute at a special panel at the World 
Trade Organization instead of threatening sanctions. Washington alleges 
the new EU banana import regime is unfair to South American distributors, 
most of which are owned by U.S. companies. The WTO had already condemned 
an earlier EU banana import system, but Brittan said the new regime 
met all the WTO concerns. Washington disagrees and is threatening 
to impose sanctions worth up to dlrs 1.5 billion on a wide range of 
EU products even before the WTO comes up with a new decision, Brittan 
said. He denounced the March 3 deadline set by the U.S. for resolving 
the issue. ``I said that was ridiculous,'' Brittan told reporters. 
``Sentence first, trial afterwards is what the United States are proposing.'' 
Under normal WTO procedure, a ruling on the new EU regime would take 
449 days, but the U.S. is offering just 90 days, Brittan said. To 
meet Washington halfway, Brittan offered to resolve the dispute in 
170 days through an accelerated WTO panel. ``The United States appears 
ready to break off negotiations and to resort to a course of action 
which is very likely to lead to a major trade dispute between the 
EU and the U.S., and to do great damage to the WTO,'' Brittan wrote 
in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky. The 
WTO ruled earlier this year that the EU's banana import system which 
favors former European colonies in Africa and the Caribbean violates 
its rules. In response, the EU announced changes to its system to 
come into operation on Jan. 1 ``The European Union has changed its 
banana regime in major and substantive ways and it will fully meet 
the requirements of the WTO,'' said Brittan. The WTO ruling was in 
response to a complaint by the United States, Honduras, Ecuador, Guatemala 
and Mexico that the EU system unfairly restricted their banana exports. 
The dispute comes at a bad time since a new round of global trade 
talks supervised by the World Trade Organization is to be initiated 
next year and agriculture again is poised to feature prominently. 
``We should be working hard on these things, not just on bananas,'' 
Brittan said.
