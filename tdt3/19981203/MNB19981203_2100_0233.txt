Now to a national trend getting a lot of attention these days. What 
was the lead story on "NBC nightly news" this evening. It has been 
indeed a strange week in terms of weather across this country. From 
the rocky mountains all the way to the east, temperatures in the 70's, 
when most Americans already have the goods, if not the mind set for 
winter. With Christmas just three weeks away, the heat wave is having 
a substantial effect on the normal rhythms of things like life and 
business. Here is NBC news correspondent Ann Thompson to start off 
our coverage of this tonight. December 3 and it sure doesn't look 
like Christmas. Today another day of record setting highs. In fact, 
each day this week as many as 20 major cities hit new marks. In many 
cases melting away consumer spending. I just haven't been in the mood 
at all. I think it has a lot to do with the weather. Almost a week 
into the Christmas shopping season, heavy coats and other winter apparel 
still Hang on racks. Analysts call outwear sales horrible. The dark 
cloud in an otherwise bright forecast. The weather related merchandise 
is spoiling Christmas a bit. It's not going to make for a bad Christmas, 
but it's going to spoil it a bit. In Chicago, 67 degrees. No reason 
to get away. At this travel agency, biness to warm weather destinations 
down 25%. There's nothing to motivate them and they're all doing their 
thing and our sales are down. In Atlanta it's convertible weather. 
They're golfing in Minneapolis and basking in sunshine in Portland, 
Maine. It's going to happen. Winter has never failed not to come. 
Forecasters say it won't disappoint. Snow, the real kind should make 
its way to the eastern United States in the next two weeks. The jetstream 
will move south. The zero degree temperatures up in Canada will be 
moving down to the northern tier of the states, and so it will feel 
a lot more like winter here over the next 10 days. Until then at New 
York's Rockefeller plaza under the world's most famous christmas tree, 
the zamboni driver will do what he can to protect the ice from 60-degree 
weather. Starting to get spring fever and it's December already. But 
it won't last. Forecasters say typical December weather will be back 
next week, in time to make it feel a lot more like Christmas. Ann 
Thompson, NBC news, Chicago.
