After years of substantial declines, the number of abortions performed 
in the United States increased very slightly in 1996, according to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 1,221,585 
abortions reported to the CDC in 1996, a 0.9 percent increase from 
the 1,210,883 reported in 1995 _ but still 15 percent below the 1,429,577 
peak reported in 1990. The abortion ratio also rose slightly, to 314 
from 311 for every 1,000 live births, in part because the number of 
live births was a little lower. The rate of abortions per 1,000 women 
ages 15 to 44 remained at 20, the lowest rate since 1975. According 
to the CDC, half the states reported fewer abortions in 1996 than 
in 1995, and half reported the same or more. ``It's too early to predict 
the pattern of abortions in the future,'' said Lisa Koonin, the CDC's 
chief of surveillance for reproductive health. ``The movement was 
less than one percent, and that kind of variation in health statistics 
can be differences in reporting, or a leveling off after years of 
declines. And it's important to put it in context by remembering that 
the rate of 20 abortions per 1,000 is unchanged and the lowest since 
1975. But we still have a major public health problem of unintended 
pregnancies.'' Population experts said it would be several years before 
it became clear whether the number of abortions would continue to 
decline, or whether that trend had ended. But it is unlikely that 
the 1997 abortion data will show a significant rise, said Stanley 
Henshaw, deputy director of research at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 
a nonprofit research group that collects parallel abortion statistics. 
``I've looked at the preliminary 1997 data from 26 states and New 
York City, and what they show collectively is a leveling off, maybe 
a small decline from 1997, and that there's not going to be any big 
increase,'' Henshaw said. He declined to speculate on what the numbers 
mean. ``It's not easy to explain no change, which is basically what 
this is,'' he said. The slight rise in abortions was particularly 
puzzling given that there has been a sharp decline in the number of 
abortion providers over the last decade. The CDC and others have said 
that the factors contributing to the overall decline in abortions 
since 1990 may have included reduced access to abortion, changes in 
attitudes about abortion, a decrease in the number of unintended pregnancies, 
and changes in contraceptive practices like the increased use of condoms 
by young women and the use of long-lasting methods like Norplant and 
Depo-Provera. According to the CDC, 55 percent of all abortions were 
performed during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, and about 88 
percent were in the first 12 weeks, the same as in the past. And as 
in previous years, 9 percent of women who had abortions were white, 
80 percent were unmarried and about 20 percent were under 20.
