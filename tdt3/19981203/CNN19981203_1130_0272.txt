planted in Rhode Island today to highlight the federal government's 
new regulations tightening purification standards. The federal government 
will give states and municipalities almost $870 million to upgrade 
did Walter facilities. The environmental protection agencies estimates 
this could help to prevents up to 460,000 cases of waterborne illnesses
