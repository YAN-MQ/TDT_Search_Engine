With fuel supplies running critically low, the government and striking 
customs workers were on a collision course Thursday after union leaders 
ignored a court order to return to work. The walkout, which began 
Monday, has severely cut the flow of gasoline and heating oil _ which 
mostly arrives in Greece via non-European Union nations. Goods shipped 
from EU partners are not affected by the strike. Many gas stations 
have run dry and heating oil is growing scarce _ a particular problem 
in chilly northern Greece. Hundreds of buses, cars and trucks stuck 
at Greece's northern borders with Bulgaria, Macedonia and Turkey formed 
lines nearly six kilometers (four miles) long at some points. The 
government was considering declaring a national emergency and forcing 
the workers back to their posts. Except for shortages and strikes, 
the capital was also hit by demonstrations and marches staged by high 
school and university students protesting education reforms. Thousands 
of students blocked key arteries leading into the capital before marching 
to the Education Ministry in the city center. Students have occupied 
nearly 300 school buildings around Greece to protest a new law changing 
the system for admittance into state universities. Teachers are also 
on strike. As the demonstrators roared ``this law won't pass,'' the 
same slogan was heard in two other parts of the city. Striking water 
company employees and railroad workers staged their own protests against 
government efforts to streamline public services. The main labor unions 
also plan a nationwide general strike Dec. 15. Many of the few cars 
left on the capital's streets were tied up in traffic jams, while 
crowds at bus and trolley stops were nearly as big as the demonstrators 
on the streets. In an effort to end the customs strike, a judge declared 
the strike illegal Wednesday. But workers refused to obey as union 
leaders sought legal loopholes to bypass the ruling. Customs workers 
are protesting plans to consolidate their pension fund with other 
agencies. According to the finance ministry, the customs strike was 
costing Greece an average of eight billion drachmas (dlrs 28.3 million) 
a day. It said a nearly week-long strike in November cost Greece about 
100 billion drachmas (dlrs 354.6 million). The Socialist government 
is determined not to back pedal on proposed reforms aimed at qualify 
Greece for the EU single currency group by 2001.
