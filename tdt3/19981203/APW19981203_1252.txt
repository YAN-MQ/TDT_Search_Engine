Tens of thousands of workers took part in demonstrations across Spain 
on Thursday to demand a 35-hour week and protest both low unemployment 
benefit levels and a government tax reform. The demonstrations were 
called by the country's two main labor federations _ the General Workers 
Union (UGT) and the Workers Commissions (CCOO). In Madrid, some 10,000 
demonstrators were led by UGT chief Candido Mendez and CCOO head Antonio 
Gutierrez as well as opposition Socialist party leader Josep Borrell 
and representatives of the United Left party. A similar number turned 
out in Barcelona while smaller demonstrations took place in some 50 
other cities and towns, according to unions. ``We're not going to 
let the business sector get the lion's share,'' Mendez told a rally 
to wrap up the Madrid demonstration. ``We're going to have to work 
hard to get this government to change its unjust and mistaken economic 
policies.'' In a statement released earlier in the day, the unions 
said they were demanding reduction of the working week to 35 hours 
without pay cuts ``as an efficient way of creating more and better 
jobs.'' The government has made much of recent reductions in unemployment, 
but Spanish jobless figures remain far higher than the European average, 
with over 19 percent of people eligible to work out of a job. The 
protest marches were also called to demand improved benefits for the 
unemployed, particularly the long-term jobless with few chances of 
finding new employment. In the statement, the unions claimed that 
half of those without a job do not receive economic benefits. A tax 
reform promising rate cuts to come into effect in 1999 is perceived 
by the unions as a ``present for the rich,'' and constitutes a third 
reason to march ,according to their statement. They reject government 
claims that the reform, predicted to reduce tax revenue by 600 billion 
pesetas (dlrs 4.3 billion), will benefit low income families most 
and promote economic growth by encouraging people to spend, save and 
invest. Instead the unions point out that basic tax for people in 
the top tax bracket falls from 56 percent to 48 percent, the minimum 
tax level only drops from 20 percent to 18 percent. They say that 
economic growth would be far better served by government spending 
on social projects and job creation. Thursday's marches marked a move 
away from the relatively cordial relations so far between the unions 
and the two-year-old conservative government of Prime Minister Jose 
Maria Aznar.
