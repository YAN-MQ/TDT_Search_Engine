Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has ordered investigators to speed 
up the probe of disgraced former President Suharto. Mr. Habibie issued 
a decree ordering his attorney general to investigate widespread suspicions 
of graft and corruption during Mr. Suharto's 32-year rule. The renewed 
push to investigate the former president comes amid widespread student 
complaints that efforts announced in November to probe Mr. Suharto's 
wealth had stalled.
