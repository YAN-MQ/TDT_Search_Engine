Analysts say traders were worried about the decision by the Brazilian 
congress to reject changes in Brazil's pension system. Those changes 
are tied to an aid package from the International Monetary Fund. Brazil 
is seen as pivotal to the economic health of Latin America in general.

cut their interest rates.
