The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 3: Former 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy's acquittal by a jury on corruption 
charges was not unexpected. The criminal case brought by independent 
counsel Donald Smaltz was based on Espy's acceptance of sports tickets, 
plane trips and luggage from food companies that he regulated. But 
the value of the gifts totaled about $35,000, and there was no evidence 
that Espy had made decisions favorable to the companies because of 
the gratuities he received. Federal statutes that prohibit government 
officials from accepting gifts do not require the showing of any quid 
pro quo. But Espy argued that the gifts came from longtime personal 
friends, which is allowed under the gratuities law. The tangle of 
circumstances and the seemingly incidental value of some of the favors 
worked against the prosecution. Indeed, the defense was so confident 
in its position that it called no witnesses. The verdict does not 
mean that investigating Espy's conduct was not proper and necessary 
or that he should not have been forced out of office. But the trial's 
outcome does call into question how well Smaltz conducted the investigation, 
which has cost $17 million over four years. While he has achieved 
multiple convictions and $11.5 million in fines and penalties, they 
mostly involve those who gave the gratuities. This case will probably 
be used by critics of the Independent Counsel Act to justify changes 
to the act to limit the time and cost of such investigations. Such 
reforms will have to be fully debated by Congress, balanced against 
the need to maintain a way to hold high-ranking officials accountable 
for their conduct. Espy, who was forced to resign from the Cabinet 
in 1994, brought these troubles on himself when he apparently adopted 
the attitude that he could ignore the federal gratuities law. Before 
joining the Clinton administration he spent six years in the House, 
where gifts and favors from special interests flowed freely. Carol 
Browner, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, testified 
at the trial that Espy said he thought the ethics code that applies 
to the executive branch was ``a bunch of junk.'' Others in the administration 
find themselves under similar legal scrutiny because they also seem 
to believe that the law did not apply to them.
