Senior Russian lawmakers voiced hopes Thursday that parliament would 
soon ratify the START II arms reduction treaty with the United States. 
Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, agreed to finish its work 
by next Tuesday on a measure that outlines Russia's nuclear weapons 
program, said Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov. The bill will then be 
sent to President Boris Yeltsin. ``It will spell out Russia's military 
doctrine and guidelines for developing new weapons that would ensure 
Russia's security,'' Seleznyov told reporters. Some Duma members in 
the past have talked about setting conditions for ratification _ a 
move that might require the U.S. Senate to review the treaty again. 
However, Seleznyov didn't mention any proposals that would make ratification 
conditional on additional actions by the United States. Vladimir Lukin, 
the head of the Duma's foreign affairs committee, said he expected 
the president to return the bill to the Duma without any major alterations. 
That could set the stage for approval of the START II treaty. Yeltsin 
previously submitted the START II treaty to the Duma for ratification. 
But Russian lawmakers wanted to outline priorities for developing 
the country's nuclear arsenal before approving the treaty. START II, 
which the two countries signed in 1993, would halve Russian and American 
nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each. The U.S. Senate ratified 
it in 1996, but the Communist-led opposition in the Russian parliament 
has balked, claiming that dismantling strategic weapons would harm 
Russia's security and be too expensive. The Russian government and 
military leaders have strongly pushed for ratification, saying that 
Russia will have to soon decommission its aging missiles anyway. There's 
been some progress in recent weeks, and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
has made a renewed push to convince lawmakers to ratify the document. 
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev met with a visiting U.S. congressional 
delegation Thursday and discussed Russia's progress on the treaty. 
U.S. Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio, called the 
discussion ``sincere'' but said there was still much work to be done 
before ratification, the Interfax news agency reported.
