After five years, it's officially over. In three paragraphs, a federal 
appeals court Wednesday formally dismissed paula Jones' sexual harassment 
suit against President Clinton. An out-of-court settlement calls for 
Jones to receive $850,000 in exchange for dropping the case. In April, 
a judge dismissed Jones' lawsuit. The appeals panel was deciding whether 
to reinstate it when the settlement was reached.
