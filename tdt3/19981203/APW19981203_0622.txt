In the latest sign of Japan's economic woes, the government said the 
world's second-largest economy shrank at an annualized pace of 2.6 
percent in the most recent quarter, marking the longest slump in more 
than four decades. The country's gross domestic product _ a measure 
of all goods and services produced _ slid 0.7 percent in the three 
months from July through September, compared to the previous quarter, 
the Economic Planning Agency said. It was the first time the economy 
has contracted for four consecutive quarters since the government 
started compiling growth statistics in 1955 and showed Japan remains 
mired in its worst recession since World War II. The news comes as 
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi struggles to prevent the economy 
from shrinking for a third consecutive year and fulfill a pledge to 
engineer a recovery within two years. Japan's top economic official, 
Economic Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya, said Thursday that the 
economy was unlikely to meet a government target for minus 1.8 percent 
growth in the fiscal year ending next March. ``It's going to be a 
little tough,'' Sakaiya told reporters. But the EPA chief said the 
worst may be over and expressed relief that the latest batch of data 
did not contain any negative surprises. ``These figures actually were 
a little better than I expected,'' he said. Many private sector economists 
were less sanguine. ``This talk about bottoming out is extremely premature,'' 
said Ron Bevacqua, economist in the Tokyo office of Merrill Lynch, 
who expects Japan's economy to shrink 2.1 percent in the current fiscal 
year. ``The prospect for recovery is quite remote,'' added Andrew 
Shipley, economist at Schroders Securities Japan Ltd. The government 
has tried to jump start the economy with massive investment in public 
works projects and temporary tax relief. Its latest stimulus package 
totals a record 24 trillion yen (dlrs 201 billion). But consumer spending, 
which accounts for two-thirds of the overall economy, remains sluggish 
as people pinch their purse strings amid growing fears about job security 
and falling incomes. Japanese corporations have also trimmed outlays 
on new plants and equipment. Worry over the stability of the banking 
system has also fanned concerns among both business leaders and consumers, 
even though the government recently earmarked about 25 trillion yen 
(dlrs 210 billion) to bailout troubled lenders. What's more, Japan 
has been hurt by a regionwide economic downturn as slack demand from 
its Asian neighbors has curtailed demand for exports, a traditional 
engine of growth. The government also said Thursday the economy shrank 
by a revised 0.4 percent during the last fiscal year ended in March 
1998, its biggest annual drop since 1974, Kyodo News reported. The 
Japanese economy hasn't shrunk two years in a row since the end of 
World War II.
