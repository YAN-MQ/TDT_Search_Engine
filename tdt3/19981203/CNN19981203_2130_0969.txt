The IRS is introducing two programs to make it easier to file your 
taxes electronically this year. Pin codes will be sent to 12 million 
taxpayers who used computer software to prepare their returns last 
year. The codes will take the place of signatures. And for the first 
time ever, people can pay their taxes with a credit card.
