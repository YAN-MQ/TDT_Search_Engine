You're listening to the Voice of America. I'm Charlene Porter, along 
with Les Carpenter. We are coming to you from Washington. Have you 
talked about your child's health today? Millions of children are dying 
or severely disabled not from war or drugs, but from a less noticeable 
threat: malnutrition. Malnutrition can cause intellectual or physical 
defects and make it harder for a child to fight off illness. Awareness 
about malnutrition must begin before a child is born. Expectant mothers 
should discuss the foods they need with a health worker to give their 
babies the best possible start. Find out from a health worker about 
the best foods to feed growing children. Your child's health is your 
family's future. Ten hours 18 universal time. The top story in the 
news: Today's scheduled launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavour was 
canceled seconds before lift off. Engineers couldn't find the cause 
of an equipment alarm. The space shuttle is carrying a component of 
the International Space Station. It's expected they'll try another 
launch on Friday. We'll have more on that story about 12 minutes from 
now. It's time now for sports. Let's check in with VOA's Jim Stevenson.
