The United Nations on Thursday appealed for some dlrs 153 million 
to help countries hit by Hurricane Mitch get through the next six 
months. The new joint appeal to donors by U.N. agencies is intended 
to ``tide over'' aid efforts while rebuilding programs for individual 
countries are worked out, according to a U.N. statement. Some dlrs 
83 million of the money is intended for Honduras and dlrs 38 million 
for Nicaragua. The rest will go to El Salvador, Guatemala and Belize. 
More than 9,000 people were killed when the hurricane struck a month 
ago, most in Honduras. More than a million people were left homeless. 
``There is now an urgent need for humanitarian assistance, particularly 
to the poorest, in the form of clean water and food, shelter, emergency 
health services, education as well as urgently needed help in agriculture,'' 
the U.N. agencies said.
