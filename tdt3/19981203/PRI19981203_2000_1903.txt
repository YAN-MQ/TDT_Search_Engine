New research is helping to explain why some people infected with HIV 
have developed the symptoms of AIDS faster than others. Scientists 
hope new findings may lead to the development of drugs to better fight 
the AIDS virus or even prevent it. The World's David Lavalley reports. 
Researchers have long recognized that some people develop AIDS more 
rapidly than others, but today's published findings better account 
for why that occurs. Researchers at The National Cancer Institute 
point to a gene called CCR5 which affects white blood cells. These 
human cells are more vulnerable if they contain more receptors which 
are like tiny doorways. The more receptors, the greater the chance 
of infection. Researchers say this discovery can help scientist design 
better drugs to fight infection by blocking these cellular doorways. 
The hope is that new blocking drugs could potentially add three or 
four years of healthy life to those living with AIDS. For The World, 
I'm David LaValley.
