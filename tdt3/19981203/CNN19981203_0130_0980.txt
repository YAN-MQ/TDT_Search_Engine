Boeing's plans to cut 20,000 more jobs is expected to have a ripple 
effect throughout the aviation industry. Charles Feldman reports. 
Baszile metals services of Los Angeles has supplied cut aluminum to 
Boeing for 22 of its 23 years in business. The company has seen many 
UPS and down in the often-turbulent aircraft industry. but -- This 
is bad. We have not seen anything like this in the long, many years 
we've been dealing with Boeing. Boeing, the largest commercial aircraft 
manufacturer in the United States, is also the largest private sector 
employer in southern california. It has close to 3,000 subcontractors 
here, representing a $3 billion annual industry. I tell my employees 
the same thing the news tells them -- that it is going to be a slowdown. 
We have to watch our expenses. We have to keep our costs down and 
wait and see what happens. Of all the subcontractors in southern California, 
hardest hit is likely to be Northrop Grumman, which builds the main 
body section for the 747. They already have done some layoffs at Northrop 
Grumman plant. There is probably going to be more, but that just ripples 
down the food chain. At baszile metals service, Barry baszile says 
there are no layoffs planned. But he and other subcontractors know 
it's time to buckle their seat belts, because they're in for a very 
bumpy ride. Charles Feldman, CNN, Los Angeles.
