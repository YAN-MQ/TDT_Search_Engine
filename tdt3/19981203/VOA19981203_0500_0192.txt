New figures released today showed the Japanese economy shrank for 
the fourth straight quarter. As Amy Bickers reports from the VOA Asia 
news center, the data shows Japan is still struggling in its battle 
to emerge from a recession. Japan's economy continues to contract. 
The Economic Planning Agency said Thursday that the nation's economy 
shrank by 7/10ths of one percent in the three months to September. 
On an annualized basis, it contracted by 2.6 percent. That marks an 
unprecedented fourth consecutive quarter of negative growth and could 
lead to two straight years of economic decline from the first time 
since the end of World War II. Thursday's data is generally in line 
with forecasts, but it's bound to disappoint officials in the United 
States and around Asia who are looking to Japan to lead the region 
out of recession. The world base said earlier this week that if the 
Japanese economy does not turn around soon, the world could plunge 
into recession next year. Amy Vickers for VOA News, Hong Kong.
