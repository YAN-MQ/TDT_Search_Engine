It's hard to know which came first but rumors have helped fuel the 
growth of the Internet. It has proved to be a breeding ground for 
rumors, especially among the conspiracy minded who log on. There is 
an especially vicious one out there right now. Put simply it says 
that blacks will lose the right to vote in the United States eight 
years from now. Somewhat unbelievably it is being taken seriously, 
and members of Congress are starting to hear about it. Our report 
from today on NBC and correspondent Joe Johns. The rumor's origin 
is hard to trace. It warns the voting rights of African-Americans 
will expire in the year 2007. Sounds crazy, of course, but for two 
years since the rumor first appeared on the Internet, black leaders 
say they've been swamped with inquiries about it. Every time they 
shoot it down, they say it pops up again. The dissemination has been 
why it spread. However just because it's been widely distributed doesn't 
mean there's any truth to it. In eight years, Congress may consider 
changes to the voting rights act of 1965, first signed by President 
Lyndon Johnson but the right of african-Americans to vote is permanent, 
and guaranteed in the 15th amendment to the constitution. The only 
issue up for review in 2007 is federal oversight of elections in certain 
states. Still, the rumor has gotten so much attention that the justice 
department took the unusual step of posting a clarification of the 
facts on its own web site. But some say skepticism about the government 
is part of the problem. That with challenges to policies like affirmative 
action, which led to this protest Wednesday in Washington state, some 
African-Americans who believe the rumor also believe their right to 
vote is precarious. There is a conrn, especially now that you've had 
the rise of a conservative movement which has challenged so many aspects 
of public policy relating to blacks, that this could go under the 
right circumstances. Even though there is a risk of perpetuating such 
a false rumor by discussing it in the national media, some experts 
say wide public exposure may be the best way to put the matter to 
rest. Joe Johns, NBC news, the capitol.
