The Toyota Camry zoomed up behind us on Interstate 5, hung hard on 
our tail as though we were in a Nascar race, swerved suddenly to pass 
on the inside, then cut sharply back into our lane. Orest Wilson, 
a Washington state trooper, braked hard to avoid a collision. It was 
a good way to catch his attention. ``Did you see that?'' he said. 
``Did you see what that knucklehead just did?'' At the wheel of his 
unmarked Chevrolet Lumina, he sounded like any driver who had been 
shoved around on the road _ except he could take action. He flipped 
down the sunvisor, into which police lights were set, switched on 
the siren and pulled the Camry over. He wrote the driver up for three 
moving violations. The total fine was $565. Trooper Wilson was getting 
to do what most drivers only wish they could. He was an angel of justice, 
just waiting for someone to display the kind of aggression that leads 
most people to mouth words they would not ordinarily use. He rarely 
had to wait more than five minutes. He was one of the first five troopers 
to serve a three-month rotation on the Washington State Patrol's Aggressive 
Driver Apprehension Team _ Adapt, for short _ which was started in 
June. Seventeen states, including New York and New Jersey, have established 
similar programs, most of them in the last year. All involve the use 
of unmarked police cars. ``I never usually see driving like that,'' 
Wilson said as he returned to cruising speed on the inside lane. ``They 
see a marked car, everyone's driving the legal speed. Down the road, 
out goes the halo, in comes the pitchfork.'' He put his foot down 
on the pedal, the souped-up engine surged smoothly up to speed, and 
he was following a Chevy Malibu at 90 miles an hour as it veered back 
and forth across five lanes of heavy suburban traffic. He was about 
to pull the transgressor over when a marked patrol car came into sight 
on the shoulder. The Malibu braked hard and moved to the inside lane. 
``Yep,'' Trooper Wilson said. ``There's the halo, hands at 10 and 
2, speed one mile under the limit. Well, guess who's been following 
you for the last three miles ...'' He flipped on his lights and siren. 
Wilson made 10 to 15 such stops a day during his rotation, and he 
would have made far more if the paperwork didn't take twice as long 
as the actual stop, or if he didn't have to wait for the regular patrol 
to arrive to arrest the drivers with suspended licenses or outstanding 
warrants. In two days of riding with him, an observer noted that most 
of the cars he stopped were small economy models: Escorts, Neons, 
Civics, Rabbits, Cavaliers _ not the vehicles one might expect to 
be driven most aggressively. ``Rather like small dogs snapping at 
big dogs?'' his passenger suggested. ``You got it,'' the trooper replied. 
``It's not the car, but the attitude that's the problem _ the idea 
that `I'm No. 1. What I'm doing is more important than what you're 
doing. I'm the only one that matters.''' Though word is out on local 
highways that unmarked patrol cars are on the prowl, it's still too 
early to tell how effective they are. ``We need a full year of statistics 
first,'' said Sgt. Gary Gasseling, the supervisor of the Adapt program. 
``What we're doing right now is reinstituting the fear factor out 
there: letting violators know that the car right beside them could 
be a police car. That makes them think about how they're driving. 
It's really driver retraining, a mix of education and enforcement.'' 
The unmarked patrol is not looking for just plain speeding, not unless 
a driver is going more than 20 mph above the limit. ``We leave that 
to the marked cars,'' Trooper Wilson said. ``We're looking for multiple 
violations, the kind of driving that's either endangering or likely 
to endanger others. I know they call us the `road rage unit,' but 
that's when the car is intentionally used as a weapon. We're aiming 
to stop aggressive driving before it reaches that stage.'' An Escort 
raced across four lanes to an exit, then wavered before pulling over 
as Trooper Wilson declared his presence. ``That makes me mad,'' he 
said as he stopped on the shoulder behind the Escort. ``They've been 
driving like homicidal maniacs, and then when the lights and siren 
are right behind them, it's: `What? You mean me? Innocent little me?''' 
He got out of the car grim-faced; the Escort driver was in for a hard 
time. But most of the time, the trooper keeps perfectly cool. ``The 
only time I lose it is when kids are involved in a crash,'' he said. 
``That upsets me.'' There were no children in the collision that occurred 
on the second day a reporter rode with him. Just a 40-year-old woman 
and her 18-year-old daughter. They had been in the fast lane going 
north on the interstate, swerved to avoid a car that cut in front 
of them, lost control, bounced and rolled over the grass median. Their 
car was then hit, broadside, by a minivan traveling south. Their bodies 
now lay beside what was left of a Honda Accord. All but one of the 
southbound lanes were closed while uniformed troopers did the lengthy 
on-site examination required for all fatal crashes, and traffic backed 
up for miles. To get out of the jam, frustrated drivers were crossing 
the median and turning into the fast lane of the northbound traffic. 
Trooper Wilson picked them off as they made the turn. Each would pay 
a $337 fine. ``You'd think it's just common sense that you wouldn't 
want to turn into a lane of traffic traveling at 70 miles an hour,'' 
Trooper Wilson said grimly. ``There's going to be another crash here. 
I guarantee it.'' It happened just a couple of minutes later, but 
not in the way he'd expected. A car had angled out of the line of 
stalled traffic to make a U-turn on the median just as a motorcylist 
was riding along illegally on the shoulder. One could see the impression 
of the biker's body on the driver's door of the car, a Hyundai whose 
license plate frame read ``How's my driving?'' above the plate number, 
answered by a vulgarity below it. ``Nice plate holder,'' said Trooper 
Wilson, coolly sardonic. The biker would live, though the medics said 
they doubted he'd walk again. ``I have no sympathy,'' the trooper 
declared. ``You recognize that bike? He was on the shoulder five minutes 
back, when I was writing up another ticket. I warned him to get back 
in lane.'' He shrugged, tight-lipped. ``That's the end of aggressive 
driving for him.''
