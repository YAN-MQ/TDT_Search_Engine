Joseph F. Unanue, a senior executive in the Goya food business, died 
Nov. 28 at the Swedish Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle. He 
was 41 and lived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and New York. The cause 
was complications from a bone-marrow transplant, according to a hospital 
spokeswoman. Unanue (pronounced u-NA-nu-way) had been executive vice 
president at Goya Foods Inc. in Secaucus, N.J., the nation's largest 
family-owned Hispanic foods business. As the second-in-command at 
the company's headquarters, he was among a handful of family and non-family 
executives who were regarded as candidates for the two top positions 
in which his father, Joseph Unanue, the president of Goya Foods, and 
his uncle, Francisco Unanue, president of Goya de Puerto Rico Inc., 
the company's main manufacturing center, share authority. Goya, which 
packages and sells about 800 food items _ from rice and beans to sauces 
and spices _ throughout the United States, Europe and Latin America, 
had revenue last year of $700 million, a more than threefold rise 
over the last decade. The company employs 2,000 people. Unanue is 
credited with leading the company's expansion into the Midwest and 
throughout the Southeast and Southwest and with broadening Goya's 
reach beyond ethnic markets to shoppers of all backgrounds. Until 
three years ago, Goya's only English-language advertising had been 
in New York. He pushed for English-language promotions in Boston, 
Washington, Philadelphia and other cities. Unanue had grown up in 
the business founded in New York in 1936 by his grandfather, Prudencio 
Unanue, a Spanish immigrant who parlayed an initial shipment of 500 
cases of Moroccan sardines into an olive-oil packing plant that just 
kept growing. As a child of 10 or 12, Unanue helped unload trucks 
and pack olives. In the summers of his undergraduate years at Duke 
University, where he received a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 
1979, he continued his apprenticeship. After receiving an M.B.A. at 
the University of North Carolina in 1981, he went to work at Goya's 
headquarters in Secaucus as director of marketing. In 1984, Unanue 
and a cousin took charge of a Goya cannery in the mountains of Puerto 
Rico. He also worked with his uncle at Goya de Puerto Rico in Bayamon. 
In 1989, he became general manager and vice president of Goya de Puerto 
Rico. Then in late 1996 he took the job as his father's No. 2 at the 
headquarters in New Jersey. In addition to his father and his mother, 
Carmen, who have homes in New Jersey and Puerto Rico, Unanue is survived 
by three daughters from his former marriage to Isabel Banuchi, Isabel, 
Sofia and Juliana, all of San Juan; four sisters, Mari Norris of Cresskill, 
N.J., Mary Ann Quinones and Mimi Guggenheim of Miami and Maribel McVicar 
of Norwood, N.J., and a brother, Andrew, of San Juan.
