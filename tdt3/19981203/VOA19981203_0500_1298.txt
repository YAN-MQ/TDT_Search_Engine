The International Basketball Federation, the sports world governing 
body, has decided that players are free to join any club in the world. 
Previously, European clubs were allowed to have only two non-European 
players on their rosters. Seventeen of the basketball organizations 
20-member central board voted in favor of the free movement change 
which could be enforced by next season. Details of the new policy 
have to be worked out at a federation meeting in May in Barcelona, 
Spain. The decision is an extension of a ruling in which soccer clubs 
in the European Union countries were forbidden from setting limits 
on players from other E.U. countries.
