And wearing a different chapeau this morning is Paul Westpheling, 
the businessman. Got a question for you. ask me. What did she say 
about the ratio between the waist measurements and the hip measurements? 
.72, I think, if that was the ratio between the waist and hips. All

with some more numbers.
