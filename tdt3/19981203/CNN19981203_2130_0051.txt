House investigators say they are dropping their probe into president 
clinton's campaign fund-raising to focus on the core charges against 
him. Three republican house Judiciary committee members tell CNN, 
chairman Henry hyde says justice department memos related to alleged 
campaign finance irregularities contained nothing that would fall 
within the realm of the inquiry. Meanwhile, CNN has learned 20 republican 
congressmen are circulating a Petition advocating censure of President 
Clinton as an alternative to impeachment. House speaker-elect Bob 
Livingston says if the committee doesn't finish its work by the end 
of next week, the inquiry probably will stretch into next year. Livingston 
says he wants the full house to vote on any articles of impeachment 
in the next two weeks. This is not something that should be taken 
lightly. It's not something that should be -- that should invoke pressure 
from any one sector of the Congress or the other. Each member of Congress 
has the responsibility to search his heart and his conscience and 
judge for himself the importance to his constituents, what his vote 
should be. And I think for us to arbitrarily prejudge the conditions 
under which he casts that vote is unfair at this point, because we 
really don't know what the recommendations of the Judiciary committee 
are going to be. CNN has learned three men who were to be deposed 
by the Judiciary committee now will not have to appear. They are FBI 
director Louis freeh, former justice department official charles LaBella, 
and White House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey.
