In China, an official government newspaper is planning to begin opening 
its judicial process to the media next year. The "China Daily" quotes 
the Supreme People's Court president, Jao Yang, as saying the move 
is part of the government's attempt to curb rampant official corruption. 
He said judicial reform will include developing a jury-based court 
system. However, observers say cases involving minors and issues deemed 
sensitive are expected to remain off limits to the public.
