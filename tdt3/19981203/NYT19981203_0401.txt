After a day of negotiations and statements that compromise was imminent, 
Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders apparently failed Thursday to 
agree on several important issues in the Northern Ireland peace effort. 
Agreements said Thursday morning to have been all but clinched began 
unraveling Thursday evening. The damage to the effort by the new Northern 
Ireland Assembly to enact the provisions of the peace agreement approved 
in the spring was serious, but not necessarily fatal. The failure 
to agree leave the effort stalled, as it has been for months. The 
Assembly members were apparently close to agreeing on governmental 
structures intended to give additional power to the province's minority 
Roman Catholics. In addition to the unsettled problems, the chief 
obstacle _ disarming the Irish Republican Army _ remained unresolved. 
There was no immediate word on whether the talks would continue Friday. 
But officials said that schedule was highly unlikely and that there 
would be no progress for the rest of the year. There had been near 
agreement on some of the governmental structures envisioned in the 
accord. ``It is progress inch by inch,'' said David Trimble, the first 
minister of the Assembly and the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist 
Party. His Catholic nationalist deputy, Seamus Mallon, said significant 
progress had been achieved. Within hours reports began to issue from 
the Assembly in the Stormont area of Belfast that Trimble had met 
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. 
Trimble was said to have repeated his demand for a start to disarmament 
before allowing Sinn Fein to participate fully in the executive cabinet 
of the Assembly and in the North-South Ministerial Council, in which 
Northern Ireland and Ireland are to cooperate. Adams' reply was not 
known. But he has repeatedly pointed out that the peace agreement 
stipulates only that the IRA disarm before May 2000. The failure to 
compromise today added importance to Trimble and Mallon's planned 
trip this weekend to Washington to meet President Clinton at a White 
House ceremony.
