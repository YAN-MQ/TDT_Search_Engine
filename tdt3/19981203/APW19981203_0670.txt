French and British leaders were beginning a two-day summit meeting 
Thursday evening that seeks to give Europe more military muscle and 
resolve to counterbalance U.S. power. The European Union, sensitive 
to criticism that it reacts too slowly and in disjointed fashion to 
crises such as Kosovo, is seeking to forge a new defense identity. 
France is pushing for an independent European defense, starting with 
a European pillar within NATO. But Britain insists NATO must remain 
the cornerstone of defense and security. ``At stake is the European 
Union's ability to have the political and strategic leadership necessary 
to conduct military operations, including with NATO,'' said French 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret. ``So it must have 
a framework to help it make decisions, and the capacity for action.'' 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac 
and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin were to attend the talks, beginning 
Thursday evening and lasting until noon on Friday, in the Britanny 
port town of Saint Malo. Topics to be discussed include EU tax levels, 
small business, and cooperation in Africa, where both countries have 
former colonies. But defense and security were expected to dominate. 
Blair is being accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, 
Chancellor Gordon Brown, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Defense 
Secretary George Robertson. France will be also be represented by 
Defense Minister Alain Richard and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. 
Officials met in Paris Wednesday for three hours to discuss defense. 
Britain's Defense Ministry said Thursday that Robertson and Richard 
will sign an agreement Friday allowing for better cooperation in crisis 
management and military operations. ``This agreement is a major and 
practical step towards strengthening Europe's defense capability,'' 
Robertson said. Britain and France, both nuclear powers and U.N. Security 
Council members, traditionally have been at odds over the role of 
the European Union. But both now recognize the need for Europe to 
cope militarily when the United States does not get involved in crises. 
Paris and London have stressed there are no plans yet to abolish the 
Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm, or to merge 
it into the European Union. The summit comes on the heels of a Franco-German 
summit earlier this week in Potsdam. French officials say the summit, 
unprecedented in terms of the number of officials attending, is the 
result of a change in British policy toward the EU since Blair's Labor 
Party took over from the Conservative Party in May 1997. On Thursday, 
the newspaper Ouest-France published a special supplement on the summit 
in both French and English and headlined: ``Welcome to Saint-Malo.''
