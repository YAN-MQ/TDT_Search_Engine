Will success, to paraphrase the title of a 1950s film about advertising, 
spoil Donny Deutsch? After years of striving, Deutsch Inc. in New 
York, the hot midsized agency that Deutsch heads as chief executive, 
has finally landed a national advertising assignment from a large 
automotive marketer. Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America expanded its 
relationship with Deutsch in mid-November by consolidating its estimated 
$250 million account there. Because a national automotive account 
is a trophy assignment for an agency in the way that a supermodel 
is a trophy spouse for an aging tycoon, competition for those duties 
is fierce. So Deutsch's patient, yearlong pursuit of Mitsubishi was 
noteworthy: The agency initially landed ad duties for 41 regional 
dealer associations, won the task to introduce the redesigned Galant 
sedan, and then gained the rest of the business. The nod from Mitsubishi 
capped a skein of account gains that helped Deutsch _ known best for 
energetic campaigns for brands like Baskin-Robbins, Foot Locker, Ikea, 
Snapple and Tanqueray _ grow into one of the three largest independent 
agencies in New York. Billings, estimated at $275 million as recently 
as 1994, are now estimated at as much as $875 million. But Deutsch, 
who in 1983 took over a small agency founded by his father, David, 
still finds acceptance from his peers more difficult to achieve than 
from advertisers. Few, for instance, would think to classify Deutsch 
among highly regarded creative powerhouses like Fallon McElligott 
in Minneapolis; Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners in San Francisco, 
owned by Omnicom Group, and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. 
The reason? Deutsch _ and by extension, his agency _ has had difficulty 
overcoming an image as a brash parvenu who uses schmooze and mirrors 
to woo clients, and gimmicks and guile to woo consumers. Rivals of 
Deutsch still deride a campaign the agency produced when Japanese 
companies were snapping up Manhattan real estate; the ads, for the 
metropolitan New York Pontiac dealers, equated buying Japanese cars 
with wanting to watch the Christmas tree being lighted at ``Mitsubishi 
Center.'' And they dismiss a commercial in which two actors played 
a gay male couple shopping at Ikea as more about changing perceptions 
of Ikea as a purveyor of unfashionable furniture than changing perceptions 
about homosexuals among mainstream consumers. The two attitudes to 
Deutsch were on display last month, when he was one of a small group 
of agency leaders selected for full-page portrait photographs in the 
20th-anniversary issue of the trade publication Adweek. The honor 
was undercut with a caption that read in part: ``Outspoken? Sure. 
Successful? Undoubtedly. Popular? Not in all circles. Donny Deutsch 
has yet to live down his reputation as a braggart who favors publicity 
stunts.'' A week later, in an interview in the sprawling, block-long 
space in Chelsea where Deutsch plans to relocate the agency in March, 
the slight remained fresh. ``I could be 80 years old in a nursing 
home and I would still get `brash,''' said Deutsch, 41, who was joined 
by a dozen senior managers for the interview on the vacant 14th floor 
of 111 Eighth Ave. ``Maybe there's just a little envy,'' he added. 
If so, there has been more than a little to envy lately. Deutsch is 
one of the few agencies based in New York that have been able to open 
a thriving outpost in the Los Angeles market; the strength of the 
California operation was important to Mitsubishi, which is based in 
Cypress, Calif. The outpost, now in Marina del Rey, Calif., has 140 
employees, compared with the 324 in the main office. ``I had some 
concerns when I came to the agency,'' said Mike Sheldon, the executive 
vice president and general manager for Deutsch Los Angeles, who previously 
worked at shops including Chiat/Day. ``But I spent time with Donny 
and he said the office would be very much a part of Deutsch, like 
another floor.'' Deutsch has also opened a small Chicago office, with 
10 employees, and plans additional offices in cities like Miami. ``The 
most successful agencies have a defined culture,'' Deutsch said. ``Ours 
is being smart and aggressive, doing take-no-prisoners creative work.'' 
John Mittnacht, a partner and group account director, described the 
shared attitude the agency hopes to instill in employees as ``speaking 
Deutsch.'' Deutsch is also expanding units to handle tasks like media 
services, interactive marketing and account planning. ``In pitching 
Mitsubishi,'' Sheldon said, ``we talked about relationship marketing, 
taking them through a time line of how people think about a car from 
`prebuying,' about a year before the purchase, to the repurchase three 
years out.'' To be sure, Deutsch has downs as well as ups. The agency 
now lacks clients in high-profile markets like beer, fast food and 
technology, which Deutsch described as ``holes we have'' and categories 
``we still haven't conquered.'' The agency lost one big client, BankAmerica, 
when it was acquired by Nationsbank, and another, L.A. Cellular, is 
changing owners as AT&AMP;T takes a majority stake. The future of 
that account is cloudy because Deutsch is not on the AT&AMP;T agency 
roster. ``You read the paper one morning and your client is no longer 
your client,'' Deutsch said in a follow-up interview this week. ``But 
when it's not performance-related, you can't beat yourself up; those 
tend to even out.'' ``You're always going to have speed bumps,'' he 
added. ``That comes with the territory.'' As for the people who ``have 
waited for us to stumble,'' Deutsch said _ the ones who ``used to 
ask `Who's this kid going into Daddy's business?''' _ ``that's the 
price you pay'' for accomplishment. ``The day people stop being jealous,'' 
he added, ``is the day we have something to worry about.''
