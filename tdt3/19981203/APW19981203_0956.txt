Labor talks to end the U.S. National Basketball Association lockout 
resumed Thursday, with Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat blaming the 
five-month lockout on the club owners. ``This lockout won't end until 
the owners get as much as they can out of the players. It comes down 
to greed on their part,'' Mourning said as he arrived at the negotiations, 
a hotel across from NBA headquarters. The bargaining session was the 
first in 13 days with both sides' full negotiating committees attending. 
The first order of business was to decide whether to continue negotiating 
under the framework that the sides had discussed in two previous sessions 
_ a six- or seven-year agreement with a complicated ``escrow tax'' 
system in the final three or four years. The proposals put on the 
table in the last session Nov. 20 would include players having 10 
or 15 percent of their paychecks withheld if a targeted percentage 
of revenues devoted to salaries was exceeded. ``I think we've given 
up way more than enough and we've compromised way more than enough. 
It's time for us to dig our heels into the ground and make a stand,'' 
Mourning said. ``It's time for them to try to meet us halfway, and 
I don't think they've done that at all.'' Union director Billy Hunter 
said he was hoping to continue working within the same proposed framework, 
but deputy commissioner Russ Granik, the owners' lead negotiator, 
has suggested it may be time to throw it out and start from scratch. 
``Maybe something has changed, but right now I can't be very optimistic,'' 
Granik said upon his arrival. ``We've taken a few (steps) back since 
our last meeting, so we'll see. ``There's a sense of urgency, but 
the owners have said they won't operate our business in a way that 
makes no financial sense,'' he said. If the sides can't come up with 
a solution in the next couple of weeks, the entire 1998-99 season 
will be canceled. Commissioner David Stern has steadfastly refused 
to reveal on what date it will be too late to save the season. ``It's 
not even about finding a middle ground that both sides can be happy 
with, it's about finding a middle ground that the sides can be equally 
unhappy with,'' said union negotiating team member Danny Schayes of 
the Orlando Magic. This was only the second full bargaining session 
since the season was supposed to begin Nov. 3. The last time the sides 
met, Nov. 20, they called it their most productive session to date. 
Yet things quickly fell apart in the next couple of days as the union 
said proposed changes to free agency timing rules were a ``deal-killer,'' 
and the owners then said the union reneged on its acceptance of a 
complicated tax formula in the escrow years. The sides agreed to talk 
again only by agreeing that everything is negotiable. The lockout 
is essentially a strike by the owners. Under American labor law, without 
a contract _ or in this case a collective bargaining agreement, owners 
can prohibit _ or lock out _ players from working until a deal is 
reached. The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules 
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health insurance 
benefits, roster limits and a salary cap. The biggest issue in this 
work stoppage is money. The owners have insisted on maximum salary 
costs and the union has refused to accept a ``hard'' salary cap. The 
league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the so-called 
``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the cap to re-sign 
their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary cap an invisible 
ceiling. So far, the first two months of the season have been scrapped 
as the sides have fought over how to divide about dlrs 2 billion in 
projected annual revenues. The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, 
while the players have tied many of their concessions to receiving 
60 percent. The owners moved to 52 and 53 percent on Nov. 20 and the 
players dropped to 57 percent, but those concessions are now void 
under the ground rules that have been set for the new talks.
