Margaret Walker Alexander, who wove her experience as a black woman 
in the Deep South into stories and poems that captured the struggles 
and desires of her race, died Nov. 30 at the home of her daughter 
Marion Colmon in Chicago. She was 83 and lived in Jackson, Miss., 
on a street named for her. The cause was cancer, her family said. 
Born Margaret Abigail Walker in 1915 in Birmingham, Ala., to a minister 
who was educated at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., she 
followed in her father's footsteps. A precocious child, Margaret learned 
to read while still a toddler and began writing poetry at 15 when 
she entered the university. She received a Ph.D. from the University 
of Iowa. As a member of the WPA writing program, Dr. Alexander considered 
herself part of the Chicago Renaissance, though she claimed to have 
been cultivated by the writers of the Harlem Renaissance a decade 
earlier, most notably her mentor, the poet Langston Hughes. In 1942, 
she became the first black writer to win the Yale Series of Younger 
Poets competition, edited by Stephen Vincent Benet, for her poem ``For 
My People'' from a compilation by the same name. In it, she wrote: 
``Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let a bloody peace 
be written in the sky. Let a second generation full of courage issue 
forth; let a people loving freedom come to growth.'' The poem, often 
quoted to describe the struggles of African-Americans, became a sort 
of anthem for the Civil Rights movement. Dr. Alexander later became 
a professor at Jackson State University, where she founded the Institute 
for the Study of the History, Life and Culture of Black People in 
1968. She served as its director for 11 years, and the center was 
later renamed in her honor. In 1966 she published ``Jubilee,'' which 
told the life story of the daughter of a slave and a white plantation 
owner. The best-selling novel, The New York Times Book Review wrote, 
``chronicled the triumph of a free spirit over many kinds of bondage.'' 
The novel was at the center of a heated dispute in 1977, when Dr. 
Alexander sued author Alex Haley, alleging that his book ``Roots'' 
infringed on her copyright for ``Jubilee.'' The case was eventually 
thrown out of court. ``I don't know anybody who has captured the heart 
and soul of black people any more than she did,'' Alferdteen Harrison, 
who became the director of the institute when Dr. Alexander stepped 
down, said. ``She was our model, our mentor. She had shown the way. 
That was the mark of greatness.'' In addition to her daughter Marion, 
Dr. Alexander, who was a widow, is survived by another daughter, Margaret 
Williams, and two sons, Firnist Alexander and Sigismund Alexander, 
all of Jackson, and nine grandchildren.
