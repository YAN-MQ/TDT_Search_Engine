In Kennesaw, Georgia, a horse named Ace appears to be all right after 
a bad experience last weekend. A house sitter had to become a lifeguard 
after Ace fell through a plastic swimming pool cover into the deep 
end of the pool. The house sitter went to feed the horse but couldn't 
find him. Then she discovered that Ace had wondered on to the swimming 
pool cover and fell in. After calling the emergency telephone number 
911, the house sitter climbed into the cold pool to get hold of the 
horse by the neck and led Ace to the shallow end. He eventually got 
out, seemed a bit sluggish, but responded well when the house sitter 
put him in the stall and dried him off. I'm glad it ended well.
