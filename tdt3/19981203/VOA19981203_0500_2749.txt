There are reports of increased smoking among pregnant teenagers. The 
National Center for Health Statistics has found that while smoking 
during pregnancy has declined overall in the United States, smoking 
among pregnant teenagers is on the increase. Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala whose department oversees the Health Statistics 
Center issued an alert to future teenage mothers. Smoking is dangerous 
for babies that are developing. Most mothers-to-be have gotten the 
messages, but teenagers need to hear it, too. Ms. Shalala described 
the new report as heartbreaking. She said the teenagers who smoke 
are putting the next generation at risk, as well as themselves.
