Bob Haggart, a bassist and arranger who performed with an extraordinary 
variety of jazz groups during his nearly 70-year career, died Thursday 
in a hospital in Venice, Fla., after collapsing on his way to the 
post office. He was 84 and lived in Venice. Haggart's long and varied 
career demonstrated his own vitality as well as that of the music. 
Not only did he record with some of the greatest black jazz musicians, 
including Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, 
Sarah Vaughan and Charlie Parker, but he was a mainstay in some of 
the great white bands as well. And by the end of his life he had not 
only participated in the bands and recordings of figures like Bob 
Crosby, Eddie Condon, Muggsy Spanier, Wingy Manone, Jess Stacy and 
Jack Teagarden, but had become an important part of the neo-traditionalist 
movement that he helped start by forming the World's Greatest Jazz 
Band in 1968 with the trumpeter Yank Lawson. Through the mid-1990s, 
Haggart was still playing and recording with musicians like Kenny 
Davern, Bob Wilber, Jane Jarvis and others. Haggart's success came 
in part from his ability to perform in all sorts of different contexts, 
from small jazz groups to larger pop ensembles designed for singers. 
He worked with the string orchestra of Charlie Parker, and in the 
large ensembles that backed Sarah Vaughan. In the small groups his 
buoyant, swinging playing came to the forefront; at his several appearances 
at New York's 92nd Street Y in the 1990s, Haggart's playing always 
enlivened the band, making the music swing harder than it otherwise 
might have. His first significant work in jazz was as a bassist with 
the Bob Crosby band, to which he added not just his bass work but 
arrangements that often proved to be classics, including ``What's 
New,'' ``South Rampart Street Parade'' and ``The Big Noise from Winnetka,'' 
a duet for bass and drums. That number, which he composed and recorded 
with the drummer Ray Bauduc in 1938, opens with drums, has stop-time 
sections, slapped bass and a rare musical virtuosity. Haggart whistles, 
Bauduc taps on the bass strings with his sticks, and the effect is 
casual brilliance. In 1942 he left the Crosby band to freelance in 
New York, working in recording studios and in radio and television. 
During the 1940s Haggart was one of New York's most sought-after musicians, 
recording and playing with such artists as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong 
and Ella Fitzgerald. His playing with Armstrong is recorded on the 
``The Complete Town Hall Concert'' of 1947. For the next few decades 
Haggart drifted in and out of the studios. He worked occasionally 
with Bob Crosby reunion groups, and recorded with the saxophonist 
Bud Freeman in 1962. Born in Manhattan, Haggart, whose full name was 
Robert Sherwood Haggart, grew up in Douglaston, N.Y. He started playing 
guitar as a teen-ager and then switched to the double bass when he 
was 17. He is survived by a son, Bob Haggart Jr. of Sarasota, Fla., 
and a sister. In 1968 he formed the World's Greatest Jazz Band with 
Lawson, a group that in many ways provided inspiration for an entire 
movement of neo-traditionalists that came to fruition in the 1980s 
and '90s. In the '90s Haggart recorded regularly with the clarinetist 
Kenny Davern and the saxophonist Bob Wilber, along with the pianist 
Jane Jarvis and the saxophonist Rick Fay. In July 1996, he performed 
in Japan with the World's Greatest Jazz Band. He was also an accomplished 
painter in oils and watercolors and found a ready market for his work.
