The ousted boss of a bank whose troubles sparked the biggest run on 
deposits in Taiwan's history emerged from seclusion Thursday and tearfully 
complained he was set up. ``Personally, I'm not a bad guy,'' said 
Tseng Chen-jen, who was thrown out as chairman of the Taichung Business 
Bank on Nov. 25 amid allegations of improper lending. ``I will not 
evade a problem and I will not flee.'' After regulators removed Tseng, 
panicked depositors lined up and pulled out 40 billion Taiwan dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 1.2 billion) in less than 24 hours. Authorities said Tseng 
was appointed to his post on Oct. 31 and within days the bank had 
made loans of up to 7.4 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 227 million) 
to six shaky investment and property companies that had suspected 
ties to Tseng. Speaking to reporters, Tseng avoided questions about 
any loans being made without proper collateral, but said he was talking 
to several parties about taking an interest in his conglomerate, Kuang 
Shan Group. Although Tseng said he was set up, he did not provide 
any details. Several other directors were also removed from the bank 
in Taichung, which is in central Taiwan about 120 miles (200 kilometers) 
south of the capital, Taipei. The government ordered new supervisors 
to take control of the bank and provide emergency cash to reassure 
people that their money would be safe. The day after the bank run, 
authorities barred Tseng from leaving Taiwan pending investigations 
into allegations that he abused his position. A newspaper reported 
Tseng had gotten into financial trouble during a property slump several 
years ago, but he bailed himself out by going to a Las Vegas casino 
where he won U.S. dlrs 30 million.
