The major Protestant and Catholic parties in Northern Ireland clashed 
bitterly Thursday, hours after they apparently had agreed on the next 
key steps forward in making April's peace agreement a reality. The 
rival wings of Irish Catholic opinion, the moderate Social Democratic 
and Labor Party and militant Sinn Fein, both accused the major British 
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, of retreating from commitments 
made early Thursday as British Prime Minister Tony Blair oversaw negotiations. 
The prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said Blair was 
``disappointed that the parties had not been able to build on the 
progress made last night and that a number of different interpretations 
had arisen.'' When Blair left early Thursday, Catholic politicians 
were openly confident they and the Ulster Unionists would announce 
within hours two key planks of Northern Ireland's new government _ 
a 10-post Executive administration that would work alongside the Irish 
government in seven policy-making committees. The Irish prime minister, 
Bertie Ahern, had planned to travel to Belfast to demonstrate support 
for the package. But in an Ulster Unionist meeting, members complained 
to leader David Trimble that the package conceded too much at a time 
when the outlawed Irish Republican Army, linked with Sinn Fein, was 
refusing to disarm. Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor said 
the members were supporting only three of the proposed cross-border 
committees _ an essential part of the agreement for Catholics, who 
think the committees will promote eventual unification. He said Trimble 
was leaving Friday for Washington, where the eight party leaders who 
supported April's agreement will receive an award, and would then 
go to Norway where he and SDLP leader John Hume will receive the Nobel 
Peace Prize. Serious deliberations probably wouldn't resume until 
Dec. 14, Taylor said. Seamus Mallon, the SDLP deputy leader elected 
alongside Trimble to oversee formation of the administration, talked 
to reporters an hour later. The agreement, a fuming Mallon said, ``has 
been done and I stand by it. It is now for the other parties to confirm 
their commitment and participation in the agreement brokered by the 
prime minister.'' Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who met Trimble in 
the afternoon, said Trimble had confirmed ``his agreement in principle 
on 10 departments. Clearly the unionists are clawing back from that.'' 
Ahern, who spoke by phone with Blair, said they both were ``very disappointed 
that the progress that appeared to have been made last night has evaporated 
during the course of the day.''
