Hunger and cold are immediate problems for many Russians, but the 
root problems, the collapsed economy, political chaos and corruption 
have led to another terrifying condition. Organized crime is terrorizing 
Russians all over the country, striking at the very heart of this 
infant democracy. Here's NBC's Dana Lewis. Tonight, one of Moscow's 
top organized crime fighters lies in this hospital, recovering from 
an assassin's bullet, shot in the head as he left his home this morning. 
He is the latest victim of a wave of attacks on Russian officials 
trying to take on corruption. This, just days after a memorial for 
Galina staravoirova, a member of parliament and presidential hopeful, 
assassinated as she entered her apartment building in St. Petersburg. 
At her memorial, Viktor krivulin, a well-known Russian poet and politician 
struggles for the right words. "If we don't understand, this death 
should unite us," he says, "we haven't understood anything, and we've 
lost." Many believe Galina was murdered because of her crusade against 
corruption, a cancer threatening Russia. Krivulin will now lead one 
of Russia's struggling democratic parties. He's running in local elections 
in St. Petersburg, where one out of every ten candidates has a criminal 
record. Defending democracy, a lonely job in Russia. Most people are 
concerned with just struggling to survive. And while the politically 
and criminally corrupt fight it out, democracy often gets caught in 
the cross fire. In the last five years, 5 bankers, gunned down, 19 
journalists. Hundreds of business leaders, killed. Six parliament 
members, murdered. You have a total breakdown of public morality, 
and power flows from the barrel of a gun. In the absence of a strong 
government criminals control, vast business empires, banks, politicians. 
Just seven years after Russians embraced democracy, now even young 
people are disillusioned. Government is criminals, because it's impossible 
to rule in Russian any other way. But, Viktor krivulin believes democracy 
will survive. I believe. I know it. It's my struggle. It's my life. 
And that may be the price Russians know, the struggle for democracy 
is more and more a question of life or death. Dana Lewis, NBC news, 
St. Petersburg.
