Four decades after his famous father was elected president of the 
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James P. Hoffa was in a close 
race Thursday as a federal monitor began counting ballots in the election 
for the presidency of the powerful union. In recent weeks, Hoffa's 
campaign manager has sought to lower expectations, making it clear 
that Hoffa, a Detroit labor lawyer, would not win a landslide victory 
over his main challenger, Thomas Leedham of Portland, Ore., director 
of the union's warehouse division. Hoffa is hoping to win this year's 
race after losing narrowly in his 1996 race against Ron Carey, whose 
victory was overturned when a federal election monitor found that 
his aides had improperly siphoned more than $700,000 in union money 
into the Carey campaign. John Metz of St. Louis, director of the Teamsters' 
public employees division, is the third candidate in the race, but 
he has not mounted a serious campaign. ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' 
said David Lyle, a Hoffa spokesman. ``We do not anticipate a blowout 
one way or the other. Leedham is an incumbent, and he and the other 
slate have squabbled over who gets control of the incumbent arsenal, 
but all their guns have been pointed at us.'' Michael Cherkasky, the 
federal election monitor, had hired 450 workers to count the 420,000 
ballots that have been mailed in, representing less than 30 percent 
of the union's 1.4 million members. The count is being conducted in 
Alexandria, Va. Early Thursday evening, with about 4 percent of votes 
counted, union officials said Leedham had 9,306 votes, Hoffa 8,226 
and Metz 573. All those ballots were from the South, which was being 
counted first, followed by the East, the central states, the West 
and finally Canada. Cherkasky said he hoped the count would be complete 
by Sunday night. Discussing the count, Cherkasky said, ``We obviously 
have a very, very strict protocol so that we can assure the government 
and the Teamsters that every vote is going to be counted and there 
isn't going to be any fraud in the count.'' When Carey won in 1996 
by 52 percent to 48 percent, many Hoffa supporters said the previous 
federal monitor had distorted the count in Carey's favor. Those charges 
were never substantiated. Steven Trossman, a Leedham spokesman, said 
he was encouraged by the closeness of the count, because Leedham expects 
to run strongly in the East and the West. The Hoffa forces expect 
to do well in the central states, the stronghold of Hoffa's father. 
``We've started from nowhere, and we've turned this into a horse race,'' 
Trossman said. ``Hoffa's been campaigning for four years. He's spent 
millions of dollars. He has the most famous name in the history of 
American labor. And still this is going to be a close race. This shows 
the reform movement is rejuvenated.'' Leedham has sought to pick up 
the somewhat tarnished Carey mantle, pledging to continue the cleanup 
that Carey began when he was first elected in 1991. Hoffa has pledged 
to reunite a union that became badly fractured in the Carey years. 
In his campaign he has relied largely on the backing of Teamster leaders 
around the United States.
