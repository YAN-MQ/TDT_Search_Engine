Investigators hired by the American Medical Association say that the 
organization ignored its own decision-making procedures, got swept 
up in politics and failed to protect the welfare of patients when 
it endorsed a Republican bill banning a specific abortion procedure 
last year. In a scathing report, the investigators said that AMA trustees 
had abandoned the group's longstanding positions on abortion and rushed 
to embrace the bill even though it did not meet the criteria previously 
set by the association for such an endorsement. The report, part of 
a larger investigation of the board of trustees, concludes that ``the 
AMA blundered'' in its handling of the bill to outlaw the procedure 
that opponents call ``partial birth abortion.'' The trustees had been 
seeking concessions from Congress to make the bill more acceptable 
to doctors. But the report said the association ``set itself up for 
accusations of playing politics'' because it announced its support 
for the abortion bill on the same day it asked Congress to shield 
doctors from deep cuts in Medicare spending. ``Rather than focusing 
on its role as steward for the profession and the public health,'' 
the report said, ``the board got enmeshed in operational issues of 
lobbying and lost sight of its responsibility for making decisions 
which, first and foremost, benefit the patient and protect the physician-patient 
relationship.'' The report, a ``management audit'' by Booz Allen &AMP; 
Hamilton, the consulting company, is based on scores of confidential 
documents and interviews with people at all levels of the association. 
The report will be discussed next week in Honolulu at a meeting of 
the AMA House of delegates, the 486-member policy-making body for 
the association. At that time, some doctors will press the association 
to rescind its endorsement of the abortion bill, which passed Congress 
but was vetoed by President Clinton. The investigators expressed no 
views for or against abortion. But they cited the association's handling 
of the abortion bill as an example of serious flaws in its decision-making 
process. The report suggests that leaders of the association were 
manipulated by Republican members of Congress, and that the trustees 
were inexperienced and unable to deal with the intense political pressures 
surrounding their negotiations with Congress over the abortion bill 
in the spring of 1997. ``As the AMA became determined to cut a deal 
with the Congressmen,'' the report said, ``the decision-making process 
began to reel out of the control of the AMA and into the control of 
the Congressmen on the other side of the negotiating table.'' While 
the trustees negotiated directly with congressional sponsors of the 
legislation, they failed to consult adequately with the American College 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups of medical specialists, 
the report said. Some members of the association said they agreed 
with the auditors' findings. In the culture of the AMA, ``political 
considerations often take precedence over the profession's needs,'' 
said a panel of doctors who studied the structure and governance of 
the organization, at the behest of the House of Delegates. The investigators 
from Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton worked under the direct supervision 
of the doctors' panel. The extraordinary self-examination was prompted 
by a fiasco in which the AMA last year agreed to endorse health care 
products of the Sunbeam Corp. in return for millions of dollars in 
royalty payments. Stung by charges of commercialism and conflict of 
interest, the doctors' group canceled the deal, and its chief executive 
resigned. Supporters of the abortion bill repeatedly cite the AMA's 
endorsement as a reason for Congress and state legislatures to impose 
such restrictions, and many states have done so. The federal version 
was twice vetoed by President Clinton, in April 1996 and October 1997, 
but it is sure to come up again next year in Congress. The bill would 
make it a crime for a doctor to perform a partial birth abortion, 
defined as a procedure in which a doctor ``partially vaginally delivers 
a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.'' 
Supporters of the legislation say it is aimed at a specific late-term 
abortion procedure. But judges have struck down similar language in 
state laws, saying it is so broad that it has the effect of banning 
abortion techniques widely used in earlier stages of pregnancy. In 
July, for example, Judge Richard Kopf of the Federal District Court 
for Nebraska ruled that the state's ban on partial birth abortion 
was unconstitutionally vague because it did not give ``fair warning'' 
to doctors and patients about what conduct was prohibited. ``One simply 
cannot ascertain from the legislative history precisely what the Legislature 
wanted to ban,'' Kopf said. ``We know the legislators wanted to ban 
`partial birth' abortions, but that term is unknown in medical circles.'' 
Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, 
an abortion rights group, said courts had blocked or limited partial 
birth abortion laws in 18 states. At least six of the laws were modeled 
on the federal bill endorsed by the American Medical Association. 
The audit report also makes these points: _ Through the timing of 
its action on the abortion bill, ``the AMA painted a picture of itself 
as primarily concerned about protecting the financial interests of 
physicians.'' _ The trustees had ``a general sense, based on national 
polls, that the American public was opposed to the partial birth abortion 
procedure,'' but the AMA did not survey its members to ascertain what 
would be in the best interest of patients and doctors. _ The decision 
to support a ban on partial birth abortion ``contradicted longstanding 
AMA policy'' and deviated from positions reaffirmed by the house of 
delegates just five months earlier, in December 1996. _ The association 
``appeared to get swept up by the high-profile nature of the issue'' 
last year. _ The AMA had well-established procedures to set policy 
in a ``thoughtful, deliberative and democratic way,'' but disregarded 
them. Instead, it used a ``crisis mode of policy-setting.'' The trustees 
decided that they had to take a position on the abortion bill in May 
1997, rather than wait for the house of delegates to consider the 
issue at its regularly scheduled meeting one month later. As a result, 
the report says, ``many doctors were outraged.''
