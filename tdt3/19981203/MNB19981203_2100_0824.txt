Still ahead tonight, debating the creation of the independent counsel 
statute with two men who know about it. Will it ever exist again? 
Teddy gibbs can't let a sore throat stop him. Even when it feels this 
raw. He toughs it out through the hacking cough... the aches, the 
fever but when the job is done he's desperate... ...for fast, powerful 
theraflu relief. With the first sip of that soothing, lemony hot liquid 
he feels comfort instantly. Soon, his throat feels calmed his cough 
quieted. Maximum strength theraflu. Now in new cherry sore throat 
and cough. Instant comfort. Powerful relief.
