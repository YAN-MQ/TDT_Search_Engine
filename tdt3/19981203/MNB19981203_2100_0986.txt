We're talking here tonight about the independent counsel and the statute 
that created it, the broad scope of the statute is the subject of 
renewed criticism tonight after former Clinton agriculture secretary 
Mike Espy was exonerated in federal court yesterday. A jury completely 
cleared Espy of corruption charges, after a four-year independent 
counsel investigation that cost $17 million. Earlier today in an interview 
with NBC news, Espy offered his opinion of the independent counsel 
statute. The independent counsel statute will come up for reauthorization 
in 1999 midyear, and I've already offered my services as a first witness 
to try to quash it. I think it needs to be stuffed. I think it needs 
to be terminated. I don't think it's any good at all. To think that 
you can take a lay lawyer, an unprofessional prosecutor and invest 
him with authority and endow him with miions of taxpayer dollars and 
turn him loose with a red tarling on someone's fredricka without any 
supervision, without a timetable at all just to gratify his own ego, 
that's not something we should approve of in this country. So I think 
it needs to be eliminated or substantially modified. Mike Espy talking 
live here this afternooned with NBC's Ed Gordon. As he mentioned, 
the statute we'rtalking about here that creates the independent counsel 
has to be renewed every five years and it's coming up this spring.
