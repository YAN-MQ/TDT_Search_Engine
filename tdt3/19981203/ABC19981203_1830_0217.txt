In Washington today, an about-face from the republicans. Feeling the 
pressure from the rank and file, the party leadership today cleared 
the decks for the house Judiciary committee to vote on articles of 
impeachment next week, giving up the issue of the president's fund-raising. 
Here's ABC's Linda Douglass. The committee will come to order. Just 
two days ago, house Judiciary committee republicans created an uproar 
by suddenly moving to expand the impeachment inquiry into the campaign 
finance scandal. But today, chairman Henry Hyde told GOP committee 
members, "never mind." Sources say after looking at secret justice 
department documents on White House fund-raising, Hyde's investigators 
concluded they did not "yield information worth considering for articles 
of impeachment." So it is back to the Lewinsky scandal and the rush 
to a committee vote on impeachment. House speaker-to-be Bob Livingston 
politely urged the committee to hurry, he will not let the full house 
get stuck voting on impeachment during christmas week. My preference 
as I have said, would be to get it over with this year. But if the 
Judiciary committee does not complete its work next week, it would 
be pretty certain that it would have to be carried over. Carrying 
impeachment over into next year is the last thing republicans want. 
But some worry the party will pay a political price whenever they 
vote. Today, for the first time, one republican member said they would 
rather censure the president than fine him. GOP -- impeachment seems 
to be building. So why should they consider anything else? Linda Douglass, 
ABC News, Capitol Hill.
