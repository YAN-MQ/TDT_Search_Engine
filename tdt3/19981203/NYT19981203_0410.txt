While the Israeli public debates a military withdrawal from Lebanon, 
Pvt. Gil Shalom, his hair spiked with gel, strums his guitar to relieve 
the anxious boredom of being stationed on a bluff here above the sporadically 
deadly conflict between his fellow Israeli soldiers and the Shiite 
Muslim guerrillas who bomb and run. Like his bunkmates, Shalom, a 
medic who is 19 and a great fan of alternative rock music, alternates 
between feeling pride and dread that his first tour of duty has landed 
him at the Tsurit army post just inside the war zone that is southern 
Lebanon. ``The first day you get here, suddenly you feel that this 
is the real thing,'' he said Thursday, a week and a half into his 
assignment. ``The sirens go off, you crouch down in a rabbit hole 
with your friends, and you realize deep in your stomach that you could 
be one those casualties of Lebanon. ``After all we train, it's good 
to feel you're in a position to do something for your country,'' he 
continued. ``But the guys, we don't like to say we're afraid.'' In 
the last two weeks, seven Israeli soldiers have been killed by the 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon. The spate 
of funerals, all televised, prompted anew what has been a cyclical 
re-examination of the 20-year-old Israeli occupation of this ``security 
strip'' along the Israeli-Lebanese border. While the politicians discussed 
military tactics and diplomatic strategies, many Israelis asked aloud 
if there remained a purpose in putting the lives of Shalom and his 
friends on the line. The Israeli Defense Forces, which believe that 
it would be a mistake to withdraw unilaterally from Lebanon, staged 
a public relations offensive for the foreign press at an army base 
in Sfad, Israel, on Thursday. With public support for their presence 
in Lebanon at a low, their goal was to portray their military operation 
as a success, despite the recent killings, and to argue that unilateral 
withdrawal would expose the population of northern Israel to attack. 
``To every family of a soldier killed, the loss is 100 percent,'' 
said Brig. Gen. Shuki Shichrur. ``But as a country, as a state, as 
armed forces, sometimes we have to pay a price.'' The Tsurit army 
post sits high above the verdant Jordan Valley on a wind-whipped hilltop, 
exposed and chilly even under the noon sun. It lies barely over the 
purple line that separates Israel and Lebanon, at the edge of the 
zone where Israeli troops aim to serve as a buffer between the guerrillas 
and northern Israel. Army officials contend that the guerrillas, directly 
backed by Iran, and indirectly by Syria, aim to conquer Israel and 
make it part of a large Muslim state. Critics, though, say the guerrillas' 
main goal is to kick the Israelis out of Lebanon, and that the conflict 
is kept alive by the Israeli army presence there. Israeli Cabinet 
ministers traveled here Wednesday, to the edge of the conflict, outposts 
like Tsurit, which boast no heavy artillery and see little direct 
warfare. They, too, spoke with soldiers like Shalom, teen-agers who 
talk earnestly about serving their country while acknowledging that 
they call their nervous mothers everyday. After their visit, the ministers 
were supposed to have issued a statement on Lebanon, but were distracted 
by violent events in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Instead, the 
Cabinet decided to state a new policy on the peace effort: that carrying 
out of the agreement would be frozen until the Palestinians accepted 
three conditions: to abandon plans to declare a Palestinian state 
by May 1999; to accept Israeli criteria for the release of Palestinian 
prisoners, and to halt ``acts of incitement and violence.'' Thursday, 
Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said he 
was surprised the Israelis didn't add a fourth condition: ``that we 
sing the Israeli national anthem.'' And opposition leader Ehud Barak 
said the Labor Party would withdraw its safety net of support for 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's shaky coalition if a freeze is 
imposed. A world away from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the officers 
and soldiers in Lebanon pointed down the hill to a kibbutz within 
firing range of the purple line. ``We have to be here,'' Lt. Yair 
Perry, 21, said. ``Otherwise, they won't be there.'' Shichrur asserted 
that the Israeli forces have been so successful that they have deterred 
the guerrillas from even trying ``to penetrate'' the Israeli border 
for three years. Instead, the troops have absorbed the attacks, with 
21 killed so far this year, an inevitable loss in an average year 
of this particular conflict, he said. ``When armed forces fight guerrillas, 
it's like a strong lion fighting a bee,'' he said. ``It's very easy 
for the bee to hide, and very hard for the lion.'' But the Hezbollah 
has lost far more men, the Israeli general said, boasting that no 
guerrilla group has suffered greater losses. ``Read the history of 
Che Guevara, of Mao Tse-tung,'' he said.
