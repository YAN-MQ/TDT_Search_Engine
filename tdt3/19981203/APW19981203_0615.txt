A bomb exploded at a market in western Algeria on Thursday, killing 
14 people and injuring 24 others, French radio reported. The explosion 
occurred shortly before midday in Khemis Miliana, about 125 kilometers 
(78 miles) west of Algiers, France Info radio reported. No further 
details were immediately available. More than 75,000 people have died 
in an insurgency that erupted when Algeria's military-backed government 
canceled January 1992 elections that an Islamic fundamentalist group, 
the Islamic Salvation Front, was poised to win. The Muslim holy month 
of Ramadan, which begins this year on Dec. 20, has been marred by 
waves of violence each year since the insurgency began.
