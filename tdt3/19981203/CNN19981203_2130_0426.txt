Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he won't back down 
from his decision to suspend the wye river land-for-security agreement. 
He points to what he calls "Palestinian violations." This comes just 
days before President Clinton is due in the area to oversee implementing 
the second phase of the agreement. Israeli cabinet ministers watched 
footage of an attack on an Israeli soldier by a group of Palestinians, 
then voted to suspend West Bank troop withdrawal. Mr. Netanyahu says 
he holds the Palestinian authority responsible. The 19-year-old soldier 
is recovering from multiple injuries.
