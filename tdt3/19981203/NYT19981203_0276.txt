On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court once again chopped a hunk out of 
what remains of the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable 
searches and seizures. A 6-3 majority ruled that a short-term visitor 
to a home or apartment doesn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy 
_ meaning, of course, that neither does the homeowner or renter. A 
police officer was told by an informant that two men were measuring 
out drugs in a garden apartment. The officer managed to get a peek 
in the window through a gap in the blinds, saw what he believed to 
be two men bagging cocaine, left and came back with a warrant to search 
the premises. According to the Minnesota Supreme Court which had the 
case first, the officer climbed over bushes, crouched down by the 
window, and peered into the apartment through a small gap in the blinds. 
The state supreme court determined that the officer's actions violated 
the Fourth Amendment and threw out the conviction. The nation's highest 
court disagreed. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion 
for the majority. Because the two men engaged in measuring out cocaine 
were not overnight guests of the woman who leased the apartment, they 
cannot have an expectation of privacy, he wrote. While we understand 
the government's concern about illegal drugs, this logic slices the 
law pretty thin. Transparently thin. This is clearly jurisprudence 
aimed at a conclusion. The high court was not going to let these men 
free, no matter how the Fourth Amendment's protections had to be twisted. 
If the renter had invited a lover over for an afternoon delight, would 
there be no reasonable expectation of privacy? Does that mean that 
unless the renter asked the lover to stay overnight, the renter would 
not be secure from unreasonable searches? What if you invite your 
friends into your home in order to plan a political campaign to beat 
an incumbent city councilman, could the police peek in your windows 
to spy on what the group was planning? In trashing a visitor's rightful 
expectation of privacy from the outside world, the court trashed the 
homeowner's right too. This decision creates bad law, law that puts 
all of us in jeopardy.
