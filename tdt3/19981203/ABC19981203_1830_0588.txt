In Russia, they have had the coldest November on record. The average 
temperature in Moscow was about ten degrees Fahrenheit. Further north, 
well below zero. ABC's clay Scott has paid a visit to the kola peninsula. 
They are angry, they are bitter, they are cold. And they are frightened. 
In a vast area stretching from lapland on the Norwegian border across 
ten time zones to the pacific ocean, millions prepared to survive 
a winter that can last eight months. And almost everyone blames the 
government in far away Moscow. "We've been abandoned here," says this 
man, waiting in line for a sack of flour. "We've been left for good." 
In Soviet times, workers were lured to the far north by higher wages 
and state subsidies. Now support from the state has all but disappeared 
leaving people to survive the harsh Arctic winter any way they can. 
With Russia's current political and economic turmoil, Moscow has neither 
the money nor the north. The coastal waters have been frozen for weeks, 
and not even Russia's nuclear-powered ice breakers can get through, 
because the government has stopped sending money for fuel. So many 
people depend on help from Moscow. This woman hasn't seen her welfare 
money in months. All the family will eat tonight is this jar of porridge 
donatedded by a Local church. Now there are international relief agencies 
herefrac of thvillages. In one village, where temperatures of 40 below 
are common, there is only heating fuel for another week. "We're used 
to shortages of food," this woman says. "But we fear cold more than 
hunger." It took the Soviet Union bills of dollars to make the north 
livable. Now that the flow of money has all but stopped, these places 
may not be livable for long. Clay Scott, ABC News, on the kola peninsula, 
Russia.
