The holiday travel season is on. And many people are paying more for 
their hotel rooms. Stephanie Oswald has the latest travel news in 
this "working ahead" report. Finding a hotel room during the holidays 
often can be as difficult as finding the perfect gift. But according 
to the lodging research network, hotel occupancy rates in many cities 
will be lower throughout the holiday season. Some exceptions -- New 
York and Chicago, where hotels are always packed. The bad news -- 
the average cost of a nightly stay is higher, about $80, up from $77 
last year. Hyatt hotels worldwide are going Euro. Beginning January 
1st, room rate quotes will be offered in the new Euro currency. The 
new monetary unit of the European union debuts January 1st, but won't 
become official currency for three years. Buying an international 
plane ticket anytime soon? You might be charged an added service fee, 
as travel agents try to make up for lost commissions. International 
airlines are joining domestic carriers in cutting travel agent commissions 
on international tickets. Airlines now pay an 8% fee, capping the 
commission at $100 for a round-trip ticket, and $50 one way. Before 
the cuts, airlines paid agents a 10% commission. Earlier this year, 
Delta airlines announced travelers would need to pay for alcoholic 
drinks in crown rooms beginning January 1st. But now Flyers have four 
more months to drink free. The airline says it will begin charging 
for drinks on May 1st. Delta says it needs more time to train staff.
