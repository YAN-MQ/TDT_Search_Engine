Still ahead tonight -- law, order and shame. Why are more communities 
demanding those who do wrong pay in public? It is humiliating. It 
is shameful. And a person has an opportunity for self-reflection, 
and maybe they won't commit those crimes again. What's behind the 
new push for an old form of punishment? And -- from chaos to even 
worse in Russia. Organized crime tearing the country apart. Tim, I 
wish our train could go down the stairs, out the door, over to where 
grandpa makes jelly, and get us a jar of Strawberry. why? I'm hungry. 
Like all boys, Tim and Richard loved Strawberry jam. Now they make 
it the same delicious way... ucker's has for four generations. You 
know, there's a jar on the kitchen table. Trains aren't allowed on 
the kitchen table, Tim. For more than a hundred years-- when they 
said the world didn't need another nose strip we said we'll make one 
that gives instant relief of nasal congestion symptoms and is ergonomically 
contoured for a good fit. Introducing ClearPassage nose strips. After 
all we're the maker of the Afrin brand and who knows more about the 
nose? For me, Titanic was a challenge. I'm Tina earnshaw. I did the 
makeup. The elements, the costumes-- sometimes foundation can end 
up everywhere! Max factor lasting performance is virtually touchproof. 
You can change your clothes, Kiss somebody-- you can touch your face 
without having to touch up your makeup. I wish I'd had it on Titanic. 
Lasting performance from... get James Cameron's Titanic... the collectible 
companion book to the blockbuster film free... when you buy titanic 
on videocassette, now on sale, and ten dollars of Max factor products.
