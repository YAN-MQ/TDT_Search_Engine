Mr. Clinton says "all communities in all states" should have safer 
drinking water. He went to Newport, Rhode Island, to lay out a new 
three-part plan to improve water quality. Before his speech, the president 
toured a nearby water treatment facility. Then he announced new government 
standards for filtration and monitoring. The president also announced 
new rules aimed at eliminating a dangerous water-borne parasite that 
contaminated Milwaukee, Wisconsin's, water supply in 1993. 400,000 
people got sick in that outbreak, 100 people were killed. Mr. Clinton 
also pledged millions of dollars in low interest loans to help get 
the job done. The third thing we are doing is to help communities 
meet these higher standards, releasing almost $800 million to communities 
in all 50 states to upgrade their drinking water systems, including 
more than $7 million to communities right here in Rhode Island, to 
give 140 million Americans safer drinking water. The new rules are 
expected to add less than $2 a month to the average customer's Bill. 
Most water treatment facilities will have to comply with new standards 
by the year 2001.
