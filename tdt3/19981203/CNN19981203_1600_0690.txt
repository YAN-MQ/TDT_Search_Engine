This week on the "cold & flu report" -- now that the Christmas shopping 
season is officially under way, you need to protect your body from 
the extra stress of fighting through crowds of shoppers. Stress that 
can weaken the body's immune system. And holiday shopping means you'll 
be in close contact with lots of people, putting you at increased 
risk of catching a cold or the flu. As you work to stay healthy, remember 
one of the best ways to avoid the flu while you're out hunting for 
presents, to get a yearly vaccination. Although doctors say the optimal 
time has passed, it's still not too late for a flu shot.
