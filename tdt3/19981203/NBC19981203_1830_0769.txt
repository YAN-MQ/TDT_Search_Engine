And when we come back -- NBC news "in depth." They have been searching 
high and low. So why is a Texas death row inmate still on the loose? 
It's my wife. I left her sitting right here. How long has she been 
gone? You don't think? Uh-huh. What? Checked out red hot Harry's? 
No way. Lucinda gets really bad heartburn. Not anymore she doesn't. 
What's that? Looks like the remains... of an individually wrapped 
pepcid ac chewable. Introducing pepcid ac chewables. The first chewable 
to stop heartburn before it starts. Lucinda? Is that you? Start living 
heartburn free with new pepcid ac chewables.
