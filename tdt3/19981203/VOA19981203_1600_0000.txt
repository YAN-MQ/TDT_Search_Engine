a fourth straight quarter. A human rights report criticizes the Clinton 
administration for a lack of support for several international initiatives. 
Afghanistan, which the human rights report describes as an intractable 
disaster, draws the attention of a U.N. monitoring team. Ukraine's 
former premier is arrested on corruption charges in Switzerland. And 
holiday cheer shines brightly in New York City with the lighting of 
the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. I'm Tony Riggs. And I'm Erin
