From Atlanta, "CNN Headline News." I'm David Goodnow. President Clinton's 
lawyers plan to appear before the house Judiciary committee on Tuesday. 
They'll defend the president against allegations by independent counsel 
Ken starr, and they may call witnesses. On Wednesday, the lawyers 
sent a letter to Judiciary committee chairman henry Hyde, accepting 
the offer to appear. They also asked for any new material gathered 
by the committee since Starr sent his referral to Congress. The letter 
said -- "once we have reviewed the material, we will be prepared to 
present a vigorous defense of the president." Hyde says the committee 
will tentatively vote on impeachment two days after the president's 
lawyers make their appearance. If articles of impeachment are approved, 
they could go to the house floor the week of December 14th.
