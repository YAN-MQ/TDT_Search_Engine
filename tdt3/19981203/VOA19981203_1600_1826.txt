I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News. The 11 European countries which are adopting 
a common currency next month have made an unexpected coordinated cut 
in interest rates. Reflecting concerns about the global economy, the 
Bundesbank and the Bank of France led the way by reducing their benchmark

European stock prices, but traders in New York were less impressed, 
pushing prices lower.
