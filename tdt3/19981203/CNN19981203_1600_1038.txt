Trucks came roaring to the rescue for another automaker in November. 
Ford saying that total vehicle sales gained 2.1% in November, as strong 
sales of the popular light trucks offset weak car sales. It was precisely 
the problem at General Motors, the nation's largest automaker said 
November sales fell 5.6%, partly because of low inventories of trucks. 
GM is still trying to ramp up production of popular models after last 
summer's strikes.
