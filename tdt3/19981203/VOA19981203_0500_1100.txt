Turkish football club, Gallataseri, and Uventos of Italy have played 
to a 1-1 draw with no violence in their politically charged Champions 
League match in Istanbul. Gallataseri snatched a last-minute goal 
to secure the tie. With 22,000 security officers deployed for Wednesday's 
match, slogans denouncing a Kurdish guerrilla group were mixed with 
upbeat soccer chants from the capacity crowd. The match had been postponed 
once amid fears that Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel 
leader to Turkey would cause local fans to turn violent against the 
Italians.
