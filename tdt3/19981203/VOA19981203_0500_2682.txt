Tobacco manufacturers consider themselves the big winners in the recent 
agreement ending their financial and legal liability to U.S. states, 
but anti-smoking advocates also believe they won important concessions. 
Washington-state Attorney General Christine Gregwar called the settlement 
the best that could be reached. Officials from Maryland and Virginia 
agree, saying it was too good to pass up. The agreement places new 
restrictions on the way cigarettes can be sold and marketed. It prohibits 
tobacco companies from targeting young people in marketing and from 
using cartoons in promotions. And it also prohibits cigarette makers 
from sponsoring sports teams, stadiums, or events where participants 
are under age. Under the agreement reached late last month, U.S. states 
accepted $260 billion that cigarette manufacturers offered them to 
settle state lawsuits filed against cigarette makers to recover the 
costs of treating smoke-related diseases.
