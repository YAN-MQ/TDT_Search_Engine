Now there is mind set and there's science. The record temperatures 
we're talking about are proof tonight really of what a lot of Americans 
were starting to suspect right about now. There is something going 
on where climate is concerned. A lot of the research in this area 
is being done by NASA. NBC's Robert Hager has that tonight. If it 
stays as warm as it's been, a prediction from the man who heads the 
national ocean graphic administration James Baker. This year, 1998, 
is going to be the warmest year on record for 500 years. Could it 
be our cities are contributing? To find out the space agency NASA 
sends a lear jet over urban areas. Takes one set of pictures with 
a normal camera and another in infrared showing the hottest places 
below in bright reds. Sacramento, where the pictures find a vast 50 
degrees difference between hot buildings and streets and nearby areas 
with trees. Salt Lake City, where it's found some roof tops get as 
hot as 160 degrees. City planners may actually use this information 
to hold down temperatures by planting trees to keep the snow cold 
and deep near sites for Salt Lake City's coming winter Olympics. And 
in Baton Rouge, signs of more urban heat. How the asphalt,ar, concrete 
and metal of every city, the roadways, sidewalks, even car tops all 
magnify the heat. NASA scientists found the heat builds all day long 
to create a big bubble of hot air that lingers over most cities until 
well after dark. A key researcher on the project -- There is this 
dome of elevated air temperatures over the cities three hours after 
sunset. And we can see where cities are, oh, five to even 10 degrees 
hotter than the surrounding rural countryside. In Atlanta, the scientists 
find the extra heat actually changes storm patterns, driving rain 
away into the suburbs. As the city got hotter, there actually was 
more rain falling downwind of the city which can have profound effects 
on the city living down there. Man is part of a problem that's only 
getting worse. Robert Hager, NBC news, cape Canaveral.
