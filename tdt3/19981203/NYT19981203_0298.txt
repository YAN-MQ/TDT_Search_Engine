When an experimental filmmaker abruptly goes mainstream, it can be 
something of a shock. And when that breakthrough turns out to be an 
entertainingly pulpy dilution of the same themes that have obsessed 
the director for decades, one is almost tempted to question the seriousness 
of the work that came before. That's why ``Shattered Image,'' the 
first American movie by Raul Ruiz, the Chilean-born, Paris-based director 
who has long been a favorite on the film festival circuit, leaves 
an ambiguous impression. The movie, which aggressively parodies the 
Alfred Hitchcock of ``Vertigo'' and ``Marnie,'' may be a tongue-in-cheek 
spoof. Or it could be an homage. Ruiz probably wanted it both ways. 
``Shattered Image,'' like a number of Ruiz's earlier films, explores 
the multiple identities of characters who might be figments of each 
other's imaginations or might be people leading parallel lives. When 
we first meet the film's central character Jessie (Anne Parillaud), 
she is a gaunt, raven-haired gamine dressed in black who lures a man 
into a bathroom stall in a chic Seattle cafe and shoots him to death. 
A moment later Jessie is jolted awake. She has fallen asleep on the 
plane to Jamaica where she and her new husband, Brian (William Baldwin), 
are spending their honeymoon. The just-married Jessie is auburn-haired, 
trembling and fearful. When the couple step out of the plane, the 
half-familiar face of a strange man waiting at the airport galvanizes 
her with a flash of acute paranoia. That honeymoon threatens to be 
ruined by Jessie's conviction that the same man who once attacked 
her and left her so traumatized that she attempted suicide, has followed 
her all the way to the Caribbean. The movie continually switches back 
and forth between the frightened new wife and her homicidal Seattle 
alter ego, a professional killer who stashes the newspaper clippings 
of her unsolved crimes in the suitcase that contains her deadly arsenal. 
As the movie goes along, the two Jessies' lives become a series of 
interlocking dreams, as one keeps waking up into the life of the other. 
Underlining the surrealism is the ever-changing content of a painting 
on the wall of the couple's hotel room. The two Jessies' love lives 
also have disturbing similarities. Moments after the homicidal Jessie 
has sex with a stranger in an empty gallery at a Seattle aquarium, 
the film views the honeymooners making love through a fish tank. Other 
characters who appear in Jamaica have alter egos in Seattle. The most 
sinister is Paula (Lisanne Falk), a cold, slinky blonde who is staying 
in the same hotel and whom Jessie begins to suspect of conspiring 
with Brian either to murder her or to drive her mad. Some scenes seem 
built around old-movie references: everything from ``The Lady From 
Shanghai'' to ``Midnight Lace.'' Gluing them together and enhancing 
the Hitchcockian mood is a lush cut-rate imitation of a Bernard Herrmann 
film score. ``Shattered Image'' might have achieved a dark romantic 
eloquence had its screenplay, by Duane Poole, invested its stock characters 
with personalities that transcended their classic Hollywood prototypes. 
But Poole, who used to write and produce television movies for Aaron 
Spelling, can't do any better by his characters than have them speak 
in flat melodramatic cliches. If Ms. Parillaud and Baldwin share a 
voluptuous screen chemistry, Ms. Parillaud's mousy voice and thick 
French accent rob her performance of some crucial magnetism. As romantic 
screen couples go, they're in the same league with Cliff Robertson 
and Genevieve Bujold from Brian DePalma's ``Obsession,'' a movie that 
was even more in love with Hitchcock than this one. PRODUCTION NOTES:
