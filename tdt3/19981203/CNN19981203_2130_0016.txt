"Headline News," I'm Lynne Russell. First, Texas authorities say a 
week-long search for a death row escapee has come to an end. A prison 
spokesman tells CNN they've found a bloated body in inmate's clothing 
under a bridge about four miles from the prison in Huntsville, texas. 
They say it is the body of Martin gurule, who escaped through the 
prison fence late Thanksgiving night. Six others who attempted the 
escape with gurule were caught on prison grounds. Gurule was the subject 
of a massive manhunt. He was the first to escape Texas death row since 
1934.
