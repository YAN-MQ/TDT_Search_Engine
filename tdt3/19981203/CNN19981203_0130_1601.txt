For the past 38 days, four people have been sitting in two Volkswagen 
beetles in a suburban Atlanta mall. It was part of a contest to see 
which two would stay the longest to win a car. Eight people started 
out. But there were still four people left by Wednesday, so the sponsors 
wound up putting the breaks on the beetle mania by drawing for the 
winners. Two people won the cars. The other two got one-year leases.
