As three camels grazed nearby, 10-year-old Sahara Mouit Abdi sat in 
a tent reading a book about Kenyan geography that the animals had 
just delivered. ``It is a good book,'' said the fourth-grader, wearing 
a blue veil and white trousers. ``It has good stories from many places.'' 
Sahara was one of two dozen ethnic Somali schoolchildren who had gathered 
under an acacia tree to wait for Kenya's only Mobile Camel Library. 
Two camels delivered 200 books in four wooden boxes. A third flatly 
refused to carry a load, and leisurely strode at the rear of the little 
convoy along winding paths through the bush of northern Kenya. As 
soon as the tent was pitched in Bulla Iftin, Somali for ``village 
that is becoming enlightened,'' and the books displayed on wooden 
shelves, the children plopped down on thick grass mats that are also 
used to cushion the loads the camels carry. ``All of you will have 
to tell me what you have read,'' librarian Joseph Otieno said to the 
children in Swahili. They chose from novels, picture books and educational 
texts. For the next two hours, the children read, some occasionally 
seeking Otieno's help with difficult English words. The children speak 
Somali with their families and learn in both Swahili and English in 
school. In 1996, Wycliffe S.O. Oluoch, the Kenya National Library 
Service's head librarian in Garissa District, was seeking an efficient 
and inexpensive way of delivering books from the main library in the 
town of Garissa, about 390 kilometers (240 miles) east of Nairobi, 
to outlying villages and nomadic settlements. The roads in the region 
are so bad that even four-wheel-drive vehicles get stuck in the sand. 
The inhabitants are spread thinly in clusters of dome-like thatched 
huts or are on the move in search of pasture for their goats, cattle 
and camels. Vehicles were too expensive and impractical. Camels, said 
Olouch, were the natural choice. ``We also wanted to use something 
the community can identify with,'' he said. Camels are widely used 
in semi-arid northern Kenya because of their ability to carry heavy 
loads and travel long distances without drinking water. Camels also 
provide meat and milk, and their dung is used for fuel. Garissa journalist 
Abdulwahab Ahmed, himself a Kenyan Somali, said that Somalis, who 
are predominantly Muslim, hold the camel in great regard. ``They say 
if you look at a camel from a certain angle, the curves spells Allah 
in Arabic,'' Ahmed said. The camel library is on the road five days 
a week, serving children who are more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) 
outside Garissa. Each location is designated and a library day set. 
``The service is so popular we cannot meet the demand,'' Oluoch said. 
``The days when people thought nomads don't want to read are long 
gone.'' Each location is served once every two weeks. But only third- 
through seventh-graders can take books home when school is in session. 
During vacation, everyone has to read in the tents. ``First- and second-graders 
are not mature enough, and eighth-graders are getting ready to leave 
school, which would make it difficult for us to trace them,'' Oluoch 
said. Mohamed Farah, a teacher at Bulla Ifkin Primary School, said 
the camel library supplements what the children read in school and 
broadens their access to information. The camels are on the road for 
two weeks, eat for two weeks, then return to the road again with camel 
driver Yusuf Khalif Ahmed. Otieno, a second librarian and a handyman 
complete the camel library team. For now, it is the only one because 
Garissa is the only district capital in northern Kenya that has a 
library to supply the books.
