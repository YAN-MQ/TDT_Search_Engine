For The World, this is Alan Dow in the BBC newsroom in London. UN 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan goes to Libya on Saturday. He's trying 
to secure the extradition of two Libyans accused in the bombing of 
a PanAm jet over Lockerbie in 1988. Here's the BBC's Diplomatic Correspondent 
Barnaby Mason. Kofi Annan's announcement strengthens the possibility 
that a deal can be done. He'd be unlikely to go to Libya without very 
encouraging signals. But given General Gadhafi's record of unpredictability, 
no one is taking anything for granted. In principle, Libya has accepted 
the idea of a trial in The Netherlands. According to British officials, 
the only question outstanding is where the two Libyans suspects would 
serve any prison sentence if convicted. But, a final decision still 
has to be made by General Gadhafi. The BBC's Barnaby Mason report.
