Microsoft's lawyers tried to show in federal court Thursday that Sun 
Microsystems Inc., a tough competitor in the software industry, was 
guilty of the same sort of anti-competitive behavior that had prompted 
the federal government and 20 states to file an antitrust suit against 
Microsoft Corp. With a Sun executive, James Gosling, on the stand, 
a Microsoft lawyer, Tom Burt, introduced internal e-mail in which 
Sun executives two years ago described meetings with Netscape Communications 
Corp. at which it appeared that the two companies were working toward 
an agreement not to compete in Internet software. One memo summarizing 
Sun's goals said, ``Unify browser efforts; stop competing.'' At that 
point, Netscape had a commanding market share in the browser software 
used to navigate the Web, while Sun was creating another browser, 
called Hot Java, written in Sun's Java programming language. A key 
charge in the government's case against Microsoft is that the company 
threatened to crush Netscape if it did not cede to Microsoft the market 
for browsers written for Microsoft's Windows operating system. Microsoft 
denies that charge and says its discussions with Netscape were unremarkable. 
In court Thursday, Burt asked Gosling about the Sun-Netscape meetings. 
``It's not at all unusual for companies to get together and talk about 
how technologies ought to evolve, is it?'' he asked. Gosling said, 
``That's correct.'' But a few moments later, he added, ``I do not 
recall any kind of decision to back away from browsers because of 
any agreement with Netscape.'' Sun decided not to begin selling Hot 
Java, he said, simply because the company could not figure out how 
to make money with it when Microsoft was giving away its browser, 
Internet Explorer. Outside the courtroom, Mark Murray, a Microsoft 
spokesman, said Thursday's testimony ``further demonstrated that throughout 
the software industry, companies meet together, talk together, plan 
together.'' But David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer, said 
that was irrelevant. ``First,'' he said, ``the Sun browser had a trivial 
market share, if any. Second, there was no agreement not to compete. 
And there's no correlation with the Microsoft-Netscape meeting because, 
in that one, you saw a monopolist, Microsoft, using its monopoly power 
to crush another company unless the company agreed not to compete.'' 
``Besides,'' he added, ``even if there were a problem here, it wouldn't 
get Microsoft off the hook. `Everyone does it' doesn't really work 
as a defense.'' In some ways, Microsoft's tack Thursday appeared to 
counter its earlier strategy. On Wednesday, Burt presented a case 
that Sun, a power in the software industry, planned to use Java to 
mount a challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the PC operating system 
market. This line of attack was designed to convince Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson that Microsoft was facing such strong competition 
that it could not be considered a monopoly under the law. But on Thursday, 
Burt introduced numerous documents and testimony to suggest that Sun's 
version of Java was actually a slow, bug-ridden, poor-performing programming 
language that was the object of ridicule in the industry. Given those 
facts, he suggested, it was perfectly reasonable for Microsoft to 
create its own, superior version of Java. That tactic was intended 
to counter government evidence that Microsoft created a partly incompatible 
version of Java to cut off any competitive threat posed by Sun's version. 
Burt never addressed the seeming contradiction.
