New information on an old mystery. A researcher has told the "Los 
Angeles Times" that human bones found on a South Pacific island may 
offer new information on the disappearance of pioneering American 
aviator Amelia Earhart. The fabled Ms. Earhart vanished in 1937 in 
the South Pacific while attempting to become the first woman to fly 
around the world. Today's - Or the "Times" yesterday reported that 
the bones found by British soldiers in 1940 in the island republic 
of Kirabati were analyzed by a local British doctor who decided they 
were the remains of a man. But the current whereabouts of those bones 
are unknown. However, two forensic anthropologists say their precise 
dimensions taken from medical records indicate they belong to a Caucasian 
female, 100 centimeters tall, matching Ms. Earhart's height.
