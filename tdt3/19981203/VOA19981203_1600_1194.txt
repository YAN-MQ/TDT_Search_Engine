Well, talks have resumed between National Basketball Association team 
owners and players in New York, but the rest of the season remains 
in jeopardy. As the two sides began meeting, Miami Heat forward Alonzo 
Mourning said players have compromised enough and should dig in their 
heels. He said owners are being greedy by demanding a higher percentage 
of so-called basketball-related income which last year amounted to 
$2 billion. But Seattle Supersonics center Jim McIlvaine doesn't agree. 
He says he hopes the two sides make a deal soon. I think in order 
to get anything accomplished, you have to come in and be an optimist, 
and I am. I think as dates move on, we have to be more aggressive 
in getting the deal done and, hopefully, optimism will help them along. 
Deputy NBA Commissioner Russ Granik said he is not optimistic a settlement 
will be reached soon. The owners have pledged not to run the league 
in a way that, in Granik's words, make no financial sense. The meetings 
are the first bargaining session in nearly two weeks. The labor dispute 
has forced the cancellation of more than 200 regular season games 
so far. Commissioner David Stern has said, if a deal is not worked 
out soon, the entire season could be canceled.
