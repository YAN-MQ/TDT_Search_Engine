In Washington tonight, just three days after house republicans said 
they'd expand their impeachment inquiry to include the president's 
campaign finances, they reversed course. That has prompted a statement 
from the White House calling the committee erratic, chaotic, partisan 
and irresponsible. So tonight it looks like the end of this process 
may be in sight. Here's NBC's Gwen Ifill. Today, house republicans 
pulled back from the brink of expanding their impeachment inquiry, 
conceding they don't have enough evidence of campaign finance irregularities 
to prove criminal misconduct by the president. We just don't have 
the time to develop it. So, Consequently, we're punting, if you will, 
and will indeed undoubtedly return to the matter next year. Republicans 
said chairman Henry Hyde will not call FBI director louis freeh to 
testify about his investigation of the campaign finance issue after 
all. In a letter to the White House, the committee invited the president's 
lawyers to inspect evidence gathered against him in the Monica Lewinsky 
investigation. Democrats were elated by today's republican retreat. 
It was a dry hole in the beginning. I don't know how he could not 
have known it. Republican sources say the Judiciary is drafting impeachment 
charges to be voted on next week. That schedule supported today by 
house speaker elect Bob Livingston who takes over in January. It's 
my hope that they would finish this year. But I'm not going to make 
any decisions about procedure until we see the report and have a chance 
to digest it. Republicans on and off Capitol Hill remain sharply divided 
over how to punish the president. Members of Congress -- republicans 
and democrats -- have to actually earn their living occasionally. 
And that means doing some tough things that the polls may not agree 
with. But some republicans today were collaborating for the first 
time with the White House, attempting to win congressional support 
for censure instead of impeachment, where the president would admit 
wrongdoing and pay an unspecified fine. But republican vote counters 
say censure is a long shot. And NBC news has learned that senior senators 
are already meeting to decide what to if this hot potato leaves the 
house and lands in their laps. Gwen Ifill, "NBC news," the capitol.
