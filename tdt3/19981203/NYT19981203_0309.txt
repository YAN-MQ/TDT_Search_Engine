Snow fell at elevations as low as 1,000 feet Thursday in the northern 
Cascades of Washington as the coldest air mass of the season invaded 
the Pacific Northwest from the Gulf of Alaska. On Friday, the cold 
air mass will carve out a cold upper-level trough of low pressure 
over the West, setting the stage for a variety of weather. Scattered 
showers and isolated thunderstorms will develop across parts of southern 
California as a potent jet stream disturbance swings inland on the 
southern flank of the trough. Snow is possible in the mountains east 
of Los Angeles. Meanwhile, moderate to locally heavy snow will fall 
on parts of the northern and central Rockies as the cold, upper-level 
trough swings east from the Great Basin. Snowfall may be enhanced 
over the mountains near Salt Lake City as air moistened in transit 
over the Great Salt Lake is forced to rapidly rise. Broken areas of 
light snow will spread onto the high plains of eastern Montana and 
the western Dakotas as a compact jet stream disturbance moves overhead. 
Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms, some with moderate to 
locally heavy rains, will speckle the middle Mississippi, Tennessee 
and lower Ohio Valleys as a jet stream disturbance draws relatively 
humid air northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Patches of morning fog 
and variable clouds will dull parts of the region from the upper Ohio 
Valley and eastern Great Lakes to the central Appalachians, though 
unseasonably mild weather will persist. Spotty, light showers will 
develop gradually from west to east. FOCUS: PLUNGE INTO DROUGHT There 
is more to the developing drought across the Middle Atlantic States 
than a lack of rain. In order to assess drought, the amount of precipitation 
must be weighed against the amount of water that is lost through processes 
like evaporation. Many days this autumn have been sunny, breezy and 
relatively warm, three conditions that quicken the rate of evaporation 
of moisture from the ground and bodies of water such as reservoirs 
and lakes. Thus, during the last 60 days when precipitation has been 
sparse, evaporation rates have been high, causing a rather dramatic 
plunge into drought.
