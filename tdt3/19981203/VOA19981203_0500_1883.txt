United States and the Palestinians have rejected new Israeli conditions 
for West Bank troop withdrawals called for by the Wye River interim 
peace accord. A U.S. State Department spokesman says the Israeli conditions 
are not appropriate, and the accord should be implemented as signed. 
Israel says it is halting its pull out until Palestinians stop inciting 
anti-Israeli violence, the talk of declaring an independent state 
and the demand for the release of certain prisoners.
