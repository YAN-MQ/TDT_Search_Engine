Back at the beginning of the century when the average American lived 
only 45 years, spending the last part of one's life without teeth 
was a normal expectation. Since mid century, public drinking water 
has contained fluoride, which has brought about a dramatic decrease 
in tooth decay. The director of the National Institute on Dental Research, 
Dr. Harold Slavkin, compares the dismal dental past with the bright 
present. In 1948, we had 90 percent of children having tooth decay. 
And in 1948, more than 50 percent of adults 45 years of age and older 
had no teeth at all. Today, having no teeth is very rare, less than 
seven percent of the adult population. And essentially, half of our 
children have no dental decay of any kind, and in the remaining half, 
there are some very significant improvements.
