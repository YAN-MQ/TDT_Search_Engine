BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The U.S. envoy for Kosovo on Thursday 
presented Serb leaders with a revised draft plan for the troubled 
province and said slow progress toward permanent peace was being made 
But U.S. envoy Christopher Hill also warned that time was at a premium 
because of fears that fighting, now at a lull, could resume with the 
onset of warmer weather in the spring. ``I feel a sense of urgency,'' 
Hill said. Before going into the meeting with Serbian President Milan 
Milutinovic, Hill said the new draft reflects previous comments by 
rival Serb and ethnic Albanian officials on how to achieve a settlement 
for the ethnic Albanian-majority Serbian province. Kosovo's Albanian 
leadership wants independence from Serbia but is willing to settle 
for full autonomy as a first step. Serbia and the Serbian leadership 
of Yugoslavia is strongly opposed to any plan that would sideline 
Serbia in making decisions for Kosovo. Hill did not elaborate on details, 
but said the new plan does not explicitly specify whether Kosovo will 
become the third Yugoslav republic or would remain a Serbian province. 
Republic status for Kosovo would give it equal say with Serbia and 
Montenegro, the present Yugoslav republics. Hill told the Associated 
Press that he hoped the new draft would provide an agreement which 
would ``shift the momentum from one of violence to one of political 
settlement'' and said he planned to meet ethnic Albanian officials 
Friday to present them with the new draft. Hundreds of people were 
killed and up to 300,000 were left homeless in the Serb crackdown 
against Kosovo Albanian separatists that started in February. Bloodshed 
abated _ but did not end _ after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
agreed with U.S. Envoy Richard Holbrooke October 12 to end the Kosovo 
campaign and begin political negotiations on the province's future. 
Last week, Serbia moved to impose its own piece deal for Kosovo, defying 
an earlier U.S. Plan and warning that anything beyond some sort of 
self-rule for the province would trigger a regional war. Secessionist 
ethnic Albanian leaders have rejected the Serbian proposal, but have 
indicated they would except a U.S. Plan if it gives Kosovo the rite 
to become a third republic within Yugoslavia. Hill said the new draft 
``does not create a third republic,'' but ``addresses the internal 
aspects of Kosovo and leaves the door open for further developments 
of Kosovo status.'' While Hill said that the plan was still not in 
its final stage, he said he would like to have a settlement by spring 
because of fears that warmer weather could bring a resumption of fighting. 
``Negotiations cannot be dragged on forever,'' he said. ``We have 
a cease-fire which is holding but which would be very much strengthened 
by a political settlement.'' ``Spring should be the time for plowing 
and not for fighting,'' he added. Hill also said that the U.S. ``is 
looking at the ways to help establish a local peace force and we are 
also beginning to look at the process of what might be needed in Kosovo 
in the economic area ... so people can put down their guns and take 
up jobs.''
