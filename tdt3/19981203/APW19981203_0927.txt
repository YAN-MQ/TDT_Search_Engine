Morocco has formally notified FIFA of its interest in hosting the 
2006 World Cup finals, world soccer's governing body confirmed Thursday. 
The north African country, which submitted its notification on Wednesday, 
is the sixth country to confirm it wants the tournament. It follows 
Germany, England, Brazil, Egypt and Ghana. Prospective candidates 
have until Dec. 31 to signal their intent and until the end of July 
to submit their full bid documents. FIFA's 24-member Executive Committee 
will decide in March 2000. In Johannesburg last week, FIFA President 
Sepp Blatter declared that FIFA had a ``responsibility'' to make sure 
the tournament takes place in Africa. South Africa is expected to 
formally signal its interest this month. Blatter has long made it 
clear that he wants the finals to be awarded to the country. The case 
of both Germany and England has been weakened by the fact that they 
are both from the same continent. The 2002 finals are being split 
between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA has said co-hosting would 
be a one-time exception.
