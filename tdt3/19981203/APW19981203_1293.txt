Italy defender Alessandro Nesta played Thursday for the first time 
since tearing knee ligaments at the World Cup, entering his club Lazio 
of Rome's Italian Cup game as a substitute. Nesta, 22, joined Lazio's 
lineup at the start of the second half against Internazionale of Milan. 
The center back had been sidelined since June, when he injured his 
right knee four minutes into Italy's 2-1 victory over Austria in first-round 
play at France '98. Lazio owner Sergio Cragnotti caused an uproar 
in September when he announced plans to petition the national soccer 
federation to pay compensation for lost services of the player.
