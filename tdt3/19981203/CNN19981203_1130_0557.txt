At a time when holiday boxes should be arriving, straulians are being 
warned about suspicious packages in their mailboxes. Hugh Williams 
has the latest from Sydney. Federal police are searching for a man 
they say could be responsible for what is described as Australia's 
biggest ever terrorist campaign. The suspect, described by police 
as a man between 43 years old and 47 years old, driving a blue sedan, 
is wanted in an investigation into a series of letter bomb mailings 
that have triggered a nationwide alert. Police on Thursday evacuated 
nearly 2,000 workers from an office tower in melbourne, after a suspicious 
package was reported in a mailroom. Special operations and explosives 
experts were called in to investigate and discovered that the package 
did not contain a bomb. This scare is a result of the discovery Wednesday 
of a serial bombing campaign, targeting federal government workers 
and their families. The plot was discovered in a Canberra postal sorting 
station, when a Package detonated, slightly injuring two postal workers. 
A search uncovered 21 similar devices all addressed to the private 
residences of former and current staff of the Australian taxation 
office. Three more packages containing bombs were also found in Sydney 
and melbourne but safely detonated by police bomb squads. While the 
search continues for the suspect, post offices around Australia are 
scrutinizing packages to see if they can turn up any more letter bombs 
and warning people to notify police if they find any suspicious packages 
in their mailboxes. Hugh Williams, CNN, Sydney.
