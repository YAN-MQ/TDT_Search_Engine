An interest rate cut from the European surprises, but fails to cheer 
investors. I'm Jan Hopkins at the CNN Financial Newsdesk in New York, 
and this is "Dollars & Sense." Germany's bundesbank and the bank of 
France both cut key interest rates by 3 basis points. The rest of 
the 11-nation trading Bloc followed suit with cuts of their own. The 
central bank's hoping to inoculate Europe from the effects of slowing 
growth around the world, just weeks before the launch of the common 
european currency. European markets initially rallied, but fell back 
after the news was digested.
