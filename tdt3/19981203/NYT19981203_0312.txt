``Little Voice'' revolves around the enchanting notion that beneath 
the mousiest exterior may lurk a spectacular diva festival, one that 
sounds like heavenly lip-synching at a karaoke bar. But this is no 
sham. The film (like the play on which it is based) originated as 
a showcase for the uncanny Jane Horrocks, and she produces these fabulous 
sounds for real. Ms. Horrocks' phenomenal mimicry of musical grande 
dames from Marlene Dietrich to Marilyn Monroe, lavishing special loving 
care on Judy Garland, makes a splendid centerpiece for the otherwise 
more ordinary film built around it. Though the world suffers no shortage 
of Judy Garland imitators, Ms. Horrocks' title character is a little 
different. She's much too wispy. She's so painfully timid that she 
hides behind her bangs. When not repeating dialogue from ``The Wizard 
of Oz'' or cooing like Marilyn, she doesn't often speak. And she has 
to be quite literally dragged out of bed by the film's colorfully 
sleazy supporting characters before she will reveal her talents as 
a singer savant in front of strangers. ``The girl with the greats 
queuing up in her gullet!'' is how a club owner (Jim Broadbent) in 
a northern English town pitches Little Voice to an audience about 
to have its socks knocked off. The film was written and directed by 
Mark Herman (``Brassed Off''), expanding upon the play by Jim Cartwright 
that was written specifically to show off Ms. Horrocks' eerily perfect 
impersonations. And it doesn't have any doubt about what made Little 
Voice so reticent. Blame it on Mari, her blowsy mother, played by 
Brenda Blethyn as a motor-mouthed, aging party girl who could cow 
any daughter into a silent streak. Bawdily outspoken Mari taunts Little 
Voice and anyone else who'll listen to her, including (albeit reluctantly) 
a low-life talent agent named Ray Say (Michael Caine, in a flamboyantly 
scuzzy role). One night, apparently for lack of anything better to 
do, Ray is dragged home drunkenly by Mari. And a duel of record players 
ensues. While Little Voice is luxuriating upstairs in the music she 
adores (``That's Entertainment''), her mother downstairs is prompted 
to blast Tom Jones at spitefully high volume. Then Ray notices that 
fuses have been blown and that the amazing sounds coming from upstairs 
must be live. It's at this pregnant moment that Ms. Horrocks belts 
out ``The Man That Got Away,'' doing it so beautifully (and singing 
to a photograph of her late father, the family's original music lover) 
that strife in the household temporarily disappears. Suddenly Ray 
and Mari are in harmony, sharing a single goal: to exploit Little 
Voice to the fullest and ride her coattails as far as they can. Here's 
where ``Little Voice'' turns into something of an old standard. It 
gives Little Voice a nice young man who is her shy soulmate. (Apparently 
Ewan McGregor is an actor who can do anything, even turn a meek telephone 
installer into a serious charmer.) It gives the nice young man pet 
pigeons (``It can be boring to the nonenthusiast,'' he explains.) 
whose caged status is meant to echo the heroine's. It even has the 
nice young man say: ``Flyin' free. They like it. You should try it 
sometime, L.V.'' Convenient parallels are not likely to go unflogged 
here, in a screenplay that has Ray Say coaxing Little Voice to go 
public by telling her an inspirational story about a bluebird. A cast 
like this and the thrill of occasionally hearing a dead-on ``Ladies 
and Gentlemen, this is Mrs ... Norman ... Maine!'' do a good deal 
to offset the material's heavy hand. Despite being required to deliver 
stagey monologues in conversational tones, Caine and Ms. Blethyn add 
humor and spice. While he becomes the epitome of show-biz seediness, 
she flounces outrageously and delivers her lines with obvious glee. 
(``Give us your lips, you, and double me palpitations!'') And Ms. 
Horrocks, who not only did all her own vocals but also performed the 
film's concert scenes singing live before an audience, gives a poignantly 
lovely performance whether blossoming onstage or cowering in bed. 
If the film watches Little Voice outgrow her fears but never delves 
into why she sings a sultry ``Hey, Big Spender!'' and ``I Wanna Be 
Loved by You'' while thinking of her father, that must be a much less 
simple story. PRODUCTION NOTES: `LITTLE VOICE' Written and directed
