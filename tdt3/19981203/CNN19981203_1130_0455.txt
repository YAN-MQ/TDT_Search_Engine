At least 28 people, mostly children, died in an orphanage fire in 
the philippine capitol of Manila today. Officials expect to find more 
victims in the rubble. 70 people were inside the orphanage at the 
time of the fire. Surviving staff members said the fire spread so 
quickly they did not have time to rescue many children. City officials 
say they suspect faulty wiring caused the fire.
