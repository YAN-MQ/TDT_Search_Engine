Pain killers that are usually harmless can be dangerous even deadly, 
to people who drink heavily. The food and drug administration defines 
excessive alcohol as three or more drinks every day. The agency is 
now requiring all nonprescription pain relievers to carry labels warning 
heavy drinkers of specific dangers. Acetaminophen products must warn 
users who are daily heavy drinkers that they are at risk for river 
damage. Aspirin must warn of dangers of stomach bleeding. Any products 
containing more than one of the ingredients must warn of both health 
risks. The labels urge heavy drinkers to consult a doctor before taking 
the products. For the latest health news online, check out cmn.com/health.
