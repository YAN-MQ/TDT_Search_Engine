Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has defended his country's response 
to India's nuclear testing during a visit to Washington. Mr. Sharif 
says Pakistan has not violated international law by carrying out its 
own nuclear tests. It should be obvious that our direction to induce 
nuclear test was purely an act of self-defense. This is lesson to 
try to four countries. For us, it was a question of life and existence. 
The international community remains obsessed with the non-proliferation 
regimes. There was no consideration for our security concerns. Pakistan's 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Yesterday, President Clinton waved some 
of the sanctions imposed on Pakistan in the aftermath of the nuclear 
tests in May.
