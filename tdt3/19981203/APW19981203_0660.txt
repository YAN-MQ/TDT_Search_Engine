Outgoing Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said in his farewell remarks 
Thursday that the ``painful'' decision to quit was his own and denied 
he was ousted in a political coup. Hariri declined to form a government 
after what appeared to be a power struggle with the new president, 
Emile Lahoud. On Wednesday, Lahoud appointed Salim Hoss, a U.S.-educated 
economist to become Lebanon's next prime minister after a majority 
of the deputies in the 128-seat Parliament expressed their support 
for him. Hoss spent Thursday discussing with legislators about the 
makeup of his Cabinet, which is expected to be formed early next week. 
Rumors, fueled by Hariri's sudden and surprise departure, suggested 
that the premier may have lost a power struggle to the assertive Lahoud, 
the 62-year-old army commander who was unanimously elected president 
by Parliament in October and took office Nov. 24. But at a news conference 
Thursday, Hariri, who had been certain to be re-named as prime minister, 
said he bowed out because of what he described was the president's 
violation of constitutional rules in naming him as premier. ``It was 
a painful decision but the right one,'' Hariri told reporters, dismissing 
the rumors that he was forced out by Lahoud and his political foe, 
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. ``I am out of the government by my 
own will,'' he stressed. He said he had even prepared an acceptance 
speech, lending some credence to the speculations that he was pushed 
out. Lahoud had initially been inclined to re-appoint Hariri, the 
billionaire businessman who had been prime minister since 1992. Hariri 
even had the majority support of legislators but not the overwhelming 
margin he had enjoyed in the past because 31 of the 128 legislators 
left it to the president to decide, precipitating the feud. Hariri 
has maintained that the lawmakers must present a candidate's name 
to the head of state because ``we should not put the president in 
a position where he can be part'' of political bargaining. Under former 
President Elias Hrawi, whose term ended Nov. 24, Hariri had virtually 
run the country. As the architect of the multibillion dollar drive 
to rebuild the country from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war, 
Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and attracting 
investment to this small Arab country. On Thursday, the 53-year-old 
Hariri took pride in his work over the past six years, saying he was 
leaving office with his ``conscience clear'' and stressing that the 
achievements made were a ``precious trust'' in the hands of the new 
government. With his advisers present, the prime minister said he 
will continue to serve the nation as a member of the legislature and 
head of a political bloc in Parliament. Hoss, in his acceptance speech 
Wednesday, sought to calm fears that Hariri's departure would undermine 
the reconstruction program or devalue the currency. He said his government 
would honor contracts signed but will execute ``austerity to the extreme'' 
in government spending. Hariri said Thursday that he was pleased with 
Hoss' remarks but that he would watch the new government's policies 
and will speak out if he fails to convince the new leadership. Hariri, 
whose government remains in caretaker capacity until the new Cabinet 
is installed, left Thursday for Syria on his way to the United States 
on a private visit.
