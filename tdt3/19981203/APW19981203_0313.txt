Any trial of surviving Khmer Rouge leaders implicated in genocide 
and other crimes against humanity should take place on Cambodian soil, 
Prime Minister Hun Sen said in an interview published Thursday. Hun 
Sen said in the interview that he had told a visiting team of U.N.-appointed 
legal experts last month that an international tribunal organized 
by the United Nations would be ``impossible.'' ``It would be easier 
if the tribunal is set up by Cambodians in accordance with Cambodian 
law with international assistance,'' Hun Sen said in the interview, 
conducted Monday by the Hong Kong-based news magazine Asiaweek. The 
U.N. team spent a week in Cambodia to assess existing evidence for 
a possible trial of top Khmer Rouge leaders held responsible for the 
deaths of as many as 2 million people during the Maoist guerrillas' 
1975-79 rule of Cambodia. Hun Sen said he had been told by the team 
that the International Court of Justice at The Hague could not try 
people in absentia. Doubtful that Khmer Rouge military chief Ta Mok 
and other surviving rebels could be apprehended, the prime minister 
suggested a Cambodian trial instead. ``It is better that we hold a 
trial in absentia, issue a verdict, them ask other countries for their 
cooperation to arrest these people,'' Hun Sen said. Supreme Khmer 
Rouge leader Pol Pot died of an apparent heart attack in April, but 
a trio of important leader _ Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan _ 
are still at large with a dwindling band of armed supporters in the 
rugged mountains along the Thai-Cambodian border. The rebel's historically 
close relationship with the Thai military and the reintegration of 
several top Khmer Rouge _ also possible defendants _ into the Cambodian 
government are seen as a potential stumbling blocks to a trial. Ieng 
Sary, a deputy prime minister in the Khmer Rouge regime, received 
an amnesty from the government in 1996 in exchange for leading a mass 
defection of rebel fighters that crippled the movement. U.N. legal 
team member Sir Ninian Stephen told reporters after meeting Hun Sen 
last month that the prime minister expressed no desire to limit the 
scope of legal action. Hun Sen told Asiaweek that it would be up to 
a prosecutor to determine who would be brought to trial.
