On his return from the latest round of talks to end Congo's civil 
war, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said on Thursday that a solution 
to a four-month conflict was as remote as ever. ``At the end, everybody 
agreed that all of us are committed to the peace process, but not 
everybody agreed how to go about it,'' Bizimungu said en route from 
an African summit that concluded in Paris last week. ``Since there 
is no cease-fire, if provoked, our troops will answer back.'' Rwanda 
and Uganda have sent troops and arms to the insurgents fighting to 
topple Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad 
and Namibia have sent soldiers and equipment in support of the government. 
Despite international pressure, Kabila has refused to negotiate with 
a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected soldiers and opposition 
leaders who took up arms Aug. 2. Instead he has demanded that Rwanda 
and Uganda end their support for the insurgents and leave Congo. Both 
countries have said they will stay as long as Congo remains unstable. 
In Paris, Bizimungu agreed in principle to consider a cease-fire with 
the leaders of Uganda, Zimbabwe and Congo at another round of peace 
talks starting in Lusaka, Zambia next week. ``I think the position 
of Kabila is as rigid as it was from the day one. I don't think, judging 
from what I heard from him, that we are near any solution at all,'' 
Bizimungu said. Rwanda accuses Kabila of failing to rid the common 
border of Hutu rebels, and drafting at least 10,000 former Hutu soldiers 
and militiamen responsible for a 1994 genocide in the country in fighting 
the rebels in eastern Congo. ``Our presence in Congo has nothing to 
do with an adventure,'' Bizimungu said. ``We're there seeking the 
same solution as in 1996 _ preventing the genocide and securing our 
borders.'' Both Rwanda and Uganda played a crucial role in ousting 
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in what was then Zaire and installing 
Kabila in power in May 1997. Bizimungu also dismissed reports of a 
rift with his Ugandan allies on the tactics and strategy in Congo, 
saying both countries shared the same objectives.
