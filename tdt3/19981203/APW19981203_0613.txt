An explosion tore through a children's sanitarium at an Armenian resort 
on Thursday, killing at least four children and injuring 12 other 
people. Investigators believe the mid-afternoon blast may have been 
caused by a gas leak, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. The 
building partially collapsed and rescuers were searching the rubble 
for more victims. The sanitarium in Dzhermuk _ a well-known mineral 
water resort 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Armenia's capital, 
Yerevan _ housed children accompanied by their mothers. It was not 
immediately clear how many people were in the building at the time 
of the explosion. Armenia's President Robert Kocharian and Prime Minister 
Armen Darbinian expressed condolences to the victims' families.
