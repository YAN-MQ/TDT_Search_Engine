The federal aviation administration has issued an emergency order 
to airlines operating Boeing 747s. It wants them to stop running fuel 
pumps in dry tanks because of the risk of explosion. The FAA says 
fuel pumps could cause hot spots and sparks when operated in dry conditions. 
246 Boeing 747s registered in the United States are affected by the 
order. Airlines should leave enough fuel in the plane's center tank 
and stop using the horizontal stabilizer tank.
