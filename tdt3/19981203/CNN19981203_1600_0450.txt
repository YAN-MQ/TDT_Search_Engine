This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Friday. A strong storm in the west will move into the 
rocky mountains producing some heavy snow as low pressure drops along 
the California coast line, keeping their weather unsettled as well. 
Low pressure will also push into the Mississippi river valley with 
some showers and thunderstorms. We'll see a few showers passing out 
of New England as a cold front moves that way. It will be a little 
cooler in the northeast on Friday. 40s, 50s, a few 60s in southern 
New England. Just 20s and 30s from the great basin into the upper 
midwest. The southeast will remain mild. Looking ahead to Saturday 
-- rain in the northwest, snow in the Rockies and showers around the 
Great Lakes. On Sunday, snow in the northern Great Lakes region, showers 
and thunderstorms farther south with rain continuing in the northwest. 
And then Monday, it's pretty wet in the east. Showers continue in 
the northwest, and as you can see, it is turning cooler around much 
of the country.
