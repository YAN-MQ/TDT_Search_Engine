President Clinton has ordered a temporary release from jail of 3,000 
illegal immigrants whose countries were recently devastated by Hurricane 
Mitch. U.S. immigration officials said immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, 
El Salvador, and Guatemala are being released this week from detention 
centers across the United States. The immigrants are being freed so 
they can return to their jobs and make money to send home. The decision 
to release the immigrants is good until January 7th.
