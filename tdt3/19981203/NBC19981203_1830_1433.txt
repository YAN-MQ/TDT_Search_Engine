I'll be right back with the new push for an old punishment -- public 
humiliation for those who break the law. When your allergies are a 
nightmare, you need help. Not just any help. You need the power of 
zyrtec. Prescription zyrtec starts working fast... and keeps on working 
for 24 hours. And zyrtec works against so many allergies, from cats 
and dogs... to pollen and dust. So when allergies are a nightmare-- 
and when are they not? Remember... in studies, drowsiness was the 
most common side effect. Others included tigue and dry mouth. Most 
side effects were mild or moderate. Most people weren't bothered by 
them enough... to stop taking zyrtec. To learn more, look for... our 
ad in life magazine... or ask your doctor or pharmacist. Eating quaker 
oatmeal on a daily basis... can help lower cholesterol. Mine dropped 
29 points. That's one under the speed limit here in Lafayette, Colorado. 
Just a reminder. Forget these. Remember this? Smile. eat. Make a mess. 
Make a memory. Escape to red lobster.
