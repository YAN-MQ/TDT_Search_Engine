Bob Livingston has a rebellion on his hands. Not over impeachment. 
He is still avoiding that one. No, the speaker-designate of the House 
of Representatives has to resolve something even more weighty than 
the president's future, a matter that so deeply affects members of 
Congress that they have drummed up a petition. The concern is this: 
How many days a week should the House work? Five, as Livingston has 
proposed? Or the three to which members have become accustomed? While 
House members have shown few signs of uniting over anything, least 
of all the impeachment inquiry, they are finding a consensus on the 
workweek issue: Keep it short. Sixty-five members, most of them Republicans, 
have signed a petition and sent it to Livingston and other House leaders, 
putting the matter succinctly: ``Please do not expand the Washington 
legislative schedule to five days a week. The present three-day-a-week 
calendar gives us ample time to complete our legislative business 
and also allows us sufficient time to do important district-related 
work.'' This was a refined version of a petition circulated last month 
that was considerably more angst-filled _ and drew few signatures). 
That one said, ``Meeting in Washington five days a week will return 
us to the nonproductive stress and anxiety of 1995,'' a reference 
to the first frantic 100 days of the 104th Congress, when the new, 
fresh-scrubbed Republican majority was eager to make its mark. Things 
slowed after that, and the House drifted down to a sort of gentleman's 
club approach in which members gathered Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. 
This year they met for the fewest days of any House in modern history. 
This coincided with a chaotic end-of-session budget deal that required 
multiple postponements of the start of the fiscal year. While there 
was not necessarily a connection between the chaos and the schedule, 
Livingston drew one. A more full and orderly schedule, he said, would 
mean the work would get done on time. ``We should have longer workweeks 
and fewer holidays,'' he demanded of the current speaker, Newt Gingrich, 
in a letter written even before he announced his own candidacy for 
speaker. Livingston proposed that the House hold votes as early as 
noon Monday and as late as noon Friday. This sent alarms through the 
House. ``I work my tail off 70 hours a week,'' said Rep. Jack Kingston, 
R-Ga., explaining his signature on the petition. ``I don't need to 
be in Washington with the lobbyists two more days a week,'' he said. 
Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., signed the earlier petition but did not 
sign the current one because she was just elected to be part of the 
Republican leadership. She said she sympathized with Livingston, but 
believed the House could be more efficient without cutting into members' 
time at home. ``We work six and seven days a week,'' she said. ``People 
just don't understand this. When we're home, we're working. I'm giving 
three speeches and have a town meeting a day. After my first two years, 
I said I wouldn't work on Sundays. I was killing myself.'' Mark Corallo, 
a spokesman, said Livingston was aware of the concerns and had not 
yet decided about ``the parameters of the calendar.'' Ms. Fowler, 
for one, said Livingston was ``not rigid'' and predicted he would 
seek some sort of compromise to keep members happy.
