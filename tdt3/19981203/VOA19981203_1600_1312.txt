And two struggling National Football League teams, the Philadelphia 
Eagles and the St. Louis Rams will meet in a rare Thursday night game 
in Philadelphia. The match-up marks the return to the city where Rams 
Coach Dick Vermeil used to coach. Now 62, Vermeil led Philadelphia 
to its only Super Bowl appearance in 1981. That, of course, a game 
the Eagles ended up losing to Oakland. That's a look at sports this
