Vandals knocked over and shattered 60 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery 
in the Georgian capital Thursday, authorities said. No group claimed 
responsibility for the act, and police in the former Soviet republic 
said they were investigating. It was the second such incident at a 
Jewish cemetery in Tbilisi in recent years. Georgia's chief rabbi, 
Ariel Levin, denounced the ``barbarous act,'' which he said was carried 
out by someone ``with provocative goals.'' However, he said, ``Nobody 
will be able to cast a pall over good and fraternal relations between 
Georgians and Jews, which have existed for more than 26 centuries 
now.'' President Eduard Shevardnadze ordered police to tighten security 
at the cemetery and urged a quick, thorough investigation, according 
to presidential spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze.
