Just minutes before space shuttle "endeavour" was scheduled to lift 
off this morning, an alarm sounded. It kept launch controllers at 
Kennedy space center in Florida busy long enough to ground the shuttle 
for the day. "Endeavour" missed the launch window by just a few seconds. 
The crew is scheduled to hook up the second part of the international 
space station. NASA will try to launch "endeavour" again tomorrow 
morning. Launch controllers have determined the alarm went off after 
a momentary dip in hydraulic pressure.
