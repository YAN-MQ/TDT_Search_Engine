A management course with Shakespeare as the main text? Must be a gimmick 
_ a way to pry MBA students away from stuffy case studies for a few 
heady whiffs of great literature. But sit through Professor John O. 
Whitney's new class at the Columbia Business School and you are likely 
to have other reactions. Like ``How could anyone teach issues like 
ethics and leadership without using Shakespeare?'' Or perhaps just 
``Zounds!'' At a recent class of perhaps 50 students, Whitney was 
in his element. The day's reading was ``Coriolanus,'' the tale of 
a Roman warrior too arrogant to rule, too warlike to be ruled (except 
by his war-loving mother, Volumnia) and ultimately crushed in this 
self-created vise. Whitney kept squeezing the play for lessons _ with 
ethics as the constant drumbeat. ``How would Coriolanus relate to 
that?'' he asked, his eyes darting about for answers. Or: ``Let's 
ask the men _ how would you like to have Volumnia as a mother?'' A 
slide was projected on a screen, asking, in bold letters, ``Did your 
mother ever want you to be a doctor?'' Refusing to become mired in 
Elizabethan times, he kept yanking the class back to the present day, 
trying to give the students something that they could use in their 
careers. ``Think how this might relate to the rest of your life,'' 
he urged. Or: ``When you all become CEOs, think about this conversation.'' 
Or, in his course description: ``Any serious Shakespeare scholar would 
have shorted Sunbeam stock'' during the reign of Albert J. Dunlap. 
The silver-haired Whitney, tanned and wearing a crisp blue blazer, 
looked every inch the patrician scholar, but the twinkle in his eye 
gave him away: He was having a ball. The topic turned to leadership, 
whether in business or elsewhere, and up popped a slide asking, ``Should 
warriors go into politics?'' One student, Maureen Murphy, found a 
modern parallel in retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, who, perhaps heeding 
the lesson of Coriolanus, has so far decided that they should not. 
Another student, Jonathan Costello, called Coriolanus ``very Pattonesque.'' 
Whitney, who is 70, shot back, ``Does anyone remember Patton?'' There 
were murmurs about the movie, and he said with a laugh, ``I didn't 
see the movie, but I saw the war.'' In the play, there is a grisly 
scene that involves counting Coriolanus' battle scars. ``How many 
wounds?'' Whitney asked, then answered himself triumphantly, ``27!'' 
And the modern parallels tumbled out. Costello suggested that at one 
company where he had worked, ``your wounds were how many projects 
you'd worked on.'' Whitney chimed in that at some high-stress companies, 
``your wounds were how many divorces you got.'' Once, after getting 
a discussion going, Whitney pulled back. ``You don't need me _ mix 
it up,'' he said, and then just listened. ``I want them walking out 
of here thinking,'' he said after class. The course, a second-year 
elective, has clearly made a big impression on some of the students. 
``This is the most influential class in my two years at Columbia,'' 
said Rehana Farrell. ``You don't ever walk out thinking, `What am 
I going to do with this information?' You walk out going, `Yeah!' 
It's like a light bulb every week.'' Shakespeare, Jason Kritzer is 
now convinced, ``wrote contemporary issues 400 years ago.'' Referring 
to the heads of Citigroup, he said, ``It's like King Lear _ I wouldn't 
be surprised if Sandy Weill and John Reed were facing the same issues'' 
_ touchy issues of sharing power. As for the course, ``a literature 
professor could never bring it off,'' Kritzer said. Whitney is anything 
but a literature professor _ or, more accurately, he's a lot more. 
In addition to teaching here and at Harvard University, he has written 
a number of books and articles _ but he has spent much of his life 
in business. He founded several companies, turned several others around 
and ran the Pathmark grocery chain in the 1970s. The class over, he 
ate dinner with a half-dozen students in a faculty dining room perched 
above Morningside Heights _ a ritual. ``I've wanted to teach this 
course for 50 years,'' he said _ ever since falling in love with Shakespeare 
in college. He explained that Shakespeare ``has always been a guide 
to me,'' especially in those corporate turnarounds, and is an invaluable 
resource on his sacred trio of issues: ``leading, managing, following.'' 
``Elizabethans were preoccupied with governance _ that's what they 
talked about in the coffee houses,'' he said. As president of Pathmark, 
he used to pop in on stores at all hours. At 4 one morning, he recalled, 
a produce manager told him, ``You're the first suit I've seen in four 
years.'' A parallel? Of course. ``That's Henry V, visiting the troops. 
You must keep contact with employees.'' ``I wanted to retire,'' said 
Whitney, who now commutes weekly from Florida, ``but I made a deal, 
that I could teach anything I wanted to teach. Now I do nothing but 
think about Shakespeare _ my wife is sick of it.'' He's not, though. 
He will teach the course again next summer, and is even working on 
a book with the same title as the class, ``In Search of the Perfect 
Prince.'' What play holds the most lessons? ``That's a hard one,'' 
he said, pausing before saying firmly, ``Lear.'' King Lear, he said, 
``made the transition to being an imperial CEO _ he was a victim of 
flattery, terribly flawed.'' And lessons certainly remain. ``I still 
don't understand Shakespeare,'' he said as the evening wound down.
