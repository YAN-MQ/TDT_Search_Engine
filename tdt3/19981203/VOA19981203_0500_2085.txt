Bosnia-Herzegovina Serb Republic has reacted angrily to the arrest 
by U.S. NATO troops of a Bosnian-Serb general accused of warm crimes. 
The Bosnian-Serb president says his government will minimize contacts 
with NATO-led peacekeeping forces. General Radaslav Kirstitch was 
seized Wednesday under a secret indictment by the U.N. War Crimes 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. He's accused of directing a Serb 
attack against the U.N. haven of Srebrenica in 1995.
