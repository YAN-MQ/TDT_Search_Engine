The U.S. government said Thursday that an agreement had been reached 
in Vienna, Austria, that was expected to produce new international 
controls on the export of data-scrambling software and hardware, a 
long-contentious issue pitting individual privacy against national 
security in the information age. The new agreement by the 33 members 
of the Wassenaar Arrangement, a multilateral export-control group, 
is a compromise measure that places new restrictions on the exporting 
of mass-market software with numerical keys above 64 bits in length. 
The more bits used in a key, the stronger the encryption. But the 
increase is exponential, so that a 64-bit key is only marginally longer 
than a 56-bit key, but would take 256 times longer to break. The United 
States has long refused to allow American companies to export ``strong 
encryption'' _ that is, software that scrambles data so thoroughly 
that it is virtually impossible to decode without the key _ on the 
ground that it could be used by international terrorists to hide the 
plotting and execution of nefarious activities from the nation's intelligence 
and police agencies. The administration has been eager to close what 
it considered a loophole in foreign export controls that permits companies 
outside the United States to freely export mass-market programs like 
Internet browsers, which in the United States routinely use 128-bit 
encryption to protect financial transactions. The United States argues 
that the 64-bit key is strong enough to protect data from almost all 
computer users today. But industry executives and technical experts 
say it is not beyond the code-breaking power of the supercomputers 
used by the National Security Agency and other intelligence organizations. 
U.S. government officials said Thursday that they thought the agreement 
would reduce some opposition from America's high-technology industries, 
which say export controls increasingly put them at a disadvantage 
with foreign competitors. ``This levels the playing field between 
the U.S. and other countries,'' said Ambassador David Aaron, the president's 
special envoy for cryptography. ``Companies in other countries were 
actually advertising: `Buy our software. We don't have export controls.' 
Now they will have export controls for strong encryption.'' But technology 
experts in the United States questioned that assertion. Though the 
new agreement was likely to lead to some new restrictions, it probably 
would do little to change the policy of nations like Germany and Finland, 
which have opposed any restrictions on the export of encryption software, 
they said. ``This is probably a mixed result for the U.S.,'' said 
Stewart Baker, a Washington lawyer who represents several high-technology 
companies. ``They've eliminated record-keeping for low-level encryption, 
and what the U.S. got in exchange for that is that other countries 
now have clear authority to control the export of stronger forms of 
encryption.'' Other industry representatives predicted that the agreement 
would do little to halt the spread of encryption technology to terrorists 
or belligerent states. And whatever limits the nations enact, many 
experts have noted that the most advanced encryption software is neither 
esoteric nor costly and is easily within the grasp of most bright 
college students. Until last year, the United States placed controls 
on all exports with numerical key lengths greater than 40 bits. The 
key length for unrestricted exports was raised to 56 bits in July. 
But John Gilmore, a San Francisco privacy activist and entrepreneur, 
quickly demonstrated that it was possible to decode a message encrypted 
with a 56-bit key in just 56 hours with a custom-built computer assembled 
for less than $250,000. And given the exponential increase in the 
per-dollar power of computer technology, many privacy advocates and 
security experts argue that the 56-bit and even 64-bit numerical keys 
permitted under the new agreement are not adequate protection. Typically, 
code cracking has employed brute-force attacks in which an ultrafast 
computer or group of processors systematically tests each of a huge 
number of possible keys. But there are also many more subtle and clever 
ways to crack encryption schemes, such as guessing at a computer user's 
password. Although the United States places no domestic legal restrictions 
on encryption, the export controls alarm civil liberties groups, which 
see them as limits on private communications. Several representatives 
at U.S. companies said the new accord would help meet the federal 
government's goal of restricting the export of strong cryptography. 
``I personally believe that the governments will now have to exercise 
tighter controls, particularly on products where encryption exceeds 
56 bits,'' said Lynn McNulty, government affairs director at RSA Data 
Security, a computer security company.
