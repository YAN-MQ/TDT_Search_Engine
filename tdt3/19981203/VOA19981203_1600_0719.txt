Swiss customs agents have arrested former Ukrainian premier Pavlo 
Lazarenko on charges of corruption. Lisa Schlein reports from Geneva 
that Swiss officials say the Ukrainian premier was arrested and detained 
in the canton of Basel on Wednesday. Swiss authorities say Pavlo Lazarenko 
was arrested by customs officials as he crossed by car from France 
into Switzerland. They say the former Ukrainian premier has been handed 
over to the Geneva police where an investigating judge ordered his 
arrest. Mr. Lazarenko is accused of corruption. Swiss police officials 
say they have received 20 separate requests from Ukraine for legal 
assistance. They confirm that Switzerland is cooperating with Ukrainian 
authorities in the investigation and are trying to locate money, some 
$20 million to $40 million, which Mr. Lazarenko allegedly deposited 
in secret Swiss bank accounts. A Swiss spokesman says some documents 
related to the case have already been handed over to Ukraine. Separate 
investigations are also underway in the Swiss cantons of Bern and 
Zurich. This means that if the evidence warrants, Mr. Lazarenko could 
be tried in those cantons as well as in Geneva on charges of corruption 
and money laundering. Mr. Lazarenko served as Ukraine's prime minister 
between 1996 and '97 before being dismissed from his post by President 
Leonid Kuchma. He is now a parliamentary deputy and leads an influential 
opposition party. The former Ukrainian prime minister denies the charges 
of corruption leveled against him. He accuses President Kuchma and 
his allies of fabricating them in order to blacken his name. Last 
month, he claimed government officials were plotting to kill him. 
Swiss investigations of foreigners suspected of laundering money in 
Swiss banks have gone up since a new law forcing banks to report alleged 
shady deals went into effect in April. Swiss police report they have 
had more than 100 tip-offs since then and have frozen assets involving 
about $200 million of so-called dirty money. Earlier this week, a 
Russian man charged with organized crime and of buying Swiss property 
illegally was put on trial in Geneva. His case is regarded as another 
indication that Switzerland wants to shed the image some hold that 
it is a haven for foreign gangsters and former dictators. Lisa Schlein
