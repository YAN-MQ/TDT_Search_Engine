The United States is dismissing Israel's latest conditions on the 
Middle East peace agreement. The Clinton administration has insisted 
Israeli troops be withdrawn from parts of the West Bank. Troop withdrawal 
from 13% of the territory was part of the wye agreement, but conditional 
on security issues. Yesterday, an Israeli soldier was beaten in the 
West Bank by angry protesters. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
says he'll withdraw troops on several conditions including the end 
to Yasser Arafat's declarations to establish a Palestinian state by 
may.
