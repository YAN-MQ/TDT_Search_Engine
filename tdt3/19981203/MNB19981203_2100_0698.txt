Some good news this evening for President Clinton after reviewing 
some justice department memos. Republicans on the house Judiciary 
committee have decided campaign fundraising allegations, as a topic, 
as a subject matter, will not it turns out, be part of the overall 
impeachment inquiry. The announcement was a surprise. More on this 
from NBC news correspondent Gwen Ifill. Today house republicans pulled 
back from the brink of expanding their impeachment inquiry, conceding 
they don't have enough evidence of campaign finance irregularities 
to prove criminal misconduct by the president. We don't have the time 
to develop it so Consequently we're quitting, if you will, and we'll 
indeed undoubtedly return to the matter next year. Henry Hyde will 
not call dib director Louis freeh to talk about the issue after all 
and in a letter to the White House, the committee invited the president's 
lawyers to inspect evidence gathered against Mr. Clinton in the monica 
Lewinsky investigation. Democrats were elated by today's republican 
retreat. It was a dry hole from the beginning. I don't know how he 
could not have known it. Republican sources say the Judiciary committee 
is drafting impeachment charges to be voted on next week. That schedule 
supported today by incoming speaker Bob Livingston who takes over 
in January. It's my hope they would finish this year but I'm not going 
to make any decisions about procedure until we see the report or have 
a chance to digest it. Republicans on and off pitol hill remain sharply 
divided over how to punish the president. Members of Congress, republicans 
and democrats, have to actually earn their living occasionally and 
that means doing some tough things that the polls may not agree with. 
But some republicans today were collaborating for the first time with 
the White House, attempting to win congressional support for censure 
instead of impeachment. Where the president would admit wrongdoing 
and pay an unspecified fine. But republican vote counters say censure 
is a long shot. And NBC news has learned that senior senators are 
already meeting to decide what to do if this hot potato leaves the 
house and lands in their laps. Gwen Ifill, the capitol.
