PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador designate John Shattuck 
singled out security and the rule of law Thursday as his chief priorities 
while serving as Washington's envoy to the Czech Republic. Shattuck, 
the State Department's top human rights official who pushed to prosecute 
war criminals in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, is due to submit 
his credentials to President Vaclav Havel on Dec. 10. He succeeds 
Ambassador Jenone Walker. ``At the moment the issues of NATO accession 
are dominating...it is a very important process that is underway,'' 
Shattuck said. He confirmed the Czech Republic together with Poland 
and Hungary are on track for NATO membership at the alliance's summit 
in Washington in April next year. Shattuck said security issues were 
his number one priority as Czechs are about to share NATO's privileges 
and responsibilities. ``Issues of security involve law-enforcement 
and the protection of Czech people and Americans from crime and from 
terrorism,'' he said. Economic prosperity and reforms were also mentioned 
as crucial in U.S.-Czech relations. ``Continued market reforms are 
very important especially in the banking and industrial sectors and 
the capital markets,'' Shattuck said. He also singled out corruption 
as a danger to fledgling democracies. ``The rule of law is essential...corruption 
can eat at the heart of democracy,'' Shattuck said. For years a human 
rights official, Shattuck also voiced his concerns over civil rights 
abuses in the Czech Republic. At least 20 Gypsies have been killed 
in racially motivated attacks after the demise of Communism in 1989. 
``We are concerned about the violence by those who preach hate and 
we have to send a strong signal of unacceptability of these attacks 
by skinheads and others,'' Shattuck said.
