A New York City landmark is lighting the way toward Christmas. First 
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined today with some of America's best-known 
music recording stars in setting the Rockefeller Center Christmas 
three ablaze in colorful lights. Martin Bush takes us to the celebration. 
... the Christmas tree / The Christmas party... Twenty-six thousand 
multicolored bulbs twinkled brightly as the switch was pressed lighting 
the majestic 75-year-old Christmas tree now standing in Rockefeller 
Center. The sight delighted thousands of New Yorkers and tourists 
who watched the yearly event. I think it's a beautiful tree, and it's 
a great tradition. But before the Christmas lights lit up the 22-meter 
Norway spruce, there were two hours of entertainment, including a 
song by Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds who departed from his soft rock 
style to sing "Silent Night." Silent night / Yeah / Holy night / All 
is calm / Yeah / And all is bright... In unusually warm weather, country 
singer Garth Brooks and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton together 
threw the switch that turned on the lights dotting the Rockefeller 
Center Christmas tree. I am thrilled. I have heard about this and 
seen it on TV so many times, but to see it in person is entirely different. 
Is everybody ready? Will you join me in the countdown? Ten, nine, 
eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... The Rockefeller 
Center Christmas tree will remain lit every day until New Year's Eve 
when the lights go out. This is Martin Bush, VOA News, New York. Jingle 
bells / Jingle bells / Jingle all the way / Oh, what fun it is to 
ride in a one-horse open sleigh...
