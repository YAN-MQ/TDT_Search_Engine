Democratic party officials say they doubt republican investigators 
have enough evidence to include allegations of campaign fund-raising 
abuses and the Kathleen Willey matter in the articles of impeachment 
against president clinton. But the White House still wants access 
to confidential memos republicans have been granted permission to 
see. John king has more. President is asking for a closer look at 
the house Judiciary committee's evidence. So that his lawyers can 
prepare their case against impeachment. Mr. Clinton's lawyers are 
accepting an invitation to appear before the committee next week. 
But first, they are demanding any new information in the committee's 
hands about the Monica Lewinsky investigation or the sudden republican 
decision to expand the inquiry to include campaign finance allegations. 
The White House lawyers told the committee -- a committee spokesman 
says the panel will be fair, but that the president should know the 
truth better than anyone. Mr. Clinton's public strategy is to stay 
above the fray and insists he has more important things to worry about. 
30 days ago the American people gave us our marching orders. They 
want us to work on their behalf, they want us to work on their business. 
It's a bhan a plan image that the White House wants to contrast with 
impeachment process that democrats say is out of control. There is 
no leadership. Newt Gingrich dropped by his capitol office Wednesday 
so say good-bye to his staff, but was in noo mood to talk. The soon 
to be former speaker wants no part of the impeachment debate. Incoming 
speaker Livingston is taking a hands-off attitude, too. Livingston 
is perfectly correct in terms of withholding any judgment or not trying 
to interpose his will on this process unless and until the Judiciary 
committee makes its report. The president's lawyers say they reserve 
the right to call witnesses as part of their defense. But White House 
officials tell CNN that under no circumstances would the president 
appear before the committee. John king, CNN, the White House.
