station wNBC in New York crashed in the passaic river. We have footage 
of the chopper actually going into the water. Both people in the aircraft 
known to television viewers as chopper four, pilot Terry hawes, reporter 
Kai simonsen escaped serious injury, swam to shore. Amazingly they 
were hospitalized with cuts and bruises. They are in stable condition 
this evening. The helicopter was covering a power outage in the area, 
along with all the other choppers from competing stations when it
