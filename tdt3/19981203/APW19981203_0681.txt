Vandals knocked over and shattered 60 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery 
in the Georgian capital Thursday, authorities said. No group claimed 
responsibility for the act, and police said they were investigating. 
It was the second such incident at a Jewish cemetery in Tbilisi in 
recent years. Georgia's chief rabbi, Ariel Levin, denounced the ``barbarous 
act,'' which he said was carried out by someone ``with provocative 
goals.'' However, he added, ``Nobody will be able to cast a pall over 
good and fraternal relations between Georgians and Jews, which have 
existed for more than 26 centuries now.'' Georgian President Eduard 
Shevardnadze echoed the rabbi's words, saying: For Georgia this is 
not only inadmissible but is also unheard of. ... Last fall we celebrated 
26 centuries of peaceful coexistence.'' Shevardnadze ordered police 
to tighten security at the cemetery and urged a quick, thorough investigation, 
according to presidential spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze.
