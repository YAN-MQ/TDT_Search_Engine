U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan says he's going to Libya this weekend 
to discuss the surrender of two Libyans accused of involving in the 
bombing 10 years ago of a Pan America Airways jumbo jetliner over 
Lockerbie, Scotland. VOA Middle East Correspondent Scott Bob reports. 
The U.N. Secretary-General told reporters in Tunis Thursday he is 
going to Libya to look at solutions to the problem of bringing the 
Lockerbie suspects to trial. Libya says it will consider handing over 
the two suspects but wants guarantees they will not be tried or serve 
any sentences in Britain or the United States, which claim jurisdiction 
in the case. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions for its refusal to 
hand over the suspects.
