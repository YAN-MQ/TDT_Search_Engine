Christmas is a peculiar season. Psychologists warn that expectations 
roused by its warm image so often clash with the harsh reality of 
life that depression is widespread. The new movie ``Hi-Life'' is the 
sort of Runyonesque comedy of urban life and love that simultaneously 
nourishes the fantasies of the hopeful and compounds the misery of 
the disappointed. Written and directed by Roger Hedden in his filmmaking 
debut, ``Hi-Life'' is contrived to a fare-thee-well. But it has some 
genuine laughs, tried-and-true seasonal elements (Dickensian carolers, 
Christmas trees and other decorations, plenty of warm reds) and a 
first-rate cast that is like a reunion of old friends. As its plot 
plays out on a single night late in the Christmas season, its decent 
protagonist, Ray (Campbell Scott), the bartender at the Hi Life on 
Manhattan's Upper West Side, sets out to call in his many good-hearted 
loans to raise the $900 he thinks his sister, Susan (Moira Kelly), 
needs for an abortion. The putative father to be (for a third time) 
is her putative actor boyfriend, Jimmy (Eric Stoltz). But in fact, 
Susan knows the money is meant for an abortion for Jimmy's sister, 
Maggie (Daryl Hannah), who happens to have broken Ray's heart. Susan 
knows because Jimmy told her so. But as the worthless Jimmy knows, 
the $900 is really intended to pay his gambling debt to the bartender-bookmaker 
Fatty (Charles Durning), who is threatening a beating. Fatty assigns 
his pal Minor (Peter Riegert) to escort Jimmy to make sure the money 
arrives safely that night, but Minor has other plans. He assigns his 
girlfriend's son Ricky (Carlos Alban) to hold up Jimmy and him at 
gunpoint so that he can keep the money for himself. In the meantime, 
the softhearted Ray is making the rounds of the bars and restaurants 
where his many friends work, accompanied by April (Katrin Cartlidge), 
an Englishwoman who is one of his regular customers and is bolder 
than Ray when it comes to calling in his loans. Of course, before 
the night is over, everybody will wind up in the Hi Life, matters 
will sort themselves out and relationships will be resolved. In the 
long history of Christmas movies, ``Hi-Life'' ranks far from the top 
of the tree, but those who believe in Santa Claus (even if, as here, 
he turns out to be Jewish, hates kids and is a heel) can bask in its 
sentiment. PRODUCTION NOTES `HI-LIFE' Written and directed by Roger
