As the Congress struggles with the question of how to punish president 
clinton, short of impeachment, there's a trend sweeping the country, 
a kind of modern version of the old practice of locking an offender 
in a wooden stock in a public square. Humiliation and shame in lieu 
of conventional punishment. Does it work? Is it fair? nbc's bob faw. 
It seems like the whole country is now pointing fingers. And shouting. 
Shame, shame. In Minneapolis, police shame sex offenders by parading 
them before irate local residents. How would you like this to be on 
juror street. Kansas, Missouri, shames men who try to buy sex by televising 
their names and pictures on a city cable channel. There's even a nationally 
syndicated TV show where people appear before a Studio audience and 
host, mother love. Confess their sins, and beg forgiveness. We want 
you to be accountable for your actions. In Houston, this criminal 
court judge using the same approach. Don't say uh-huh to me. It is 
Bare-knuckled justice. No bleeding heart liberals need apply. Why 
should I give you a second chance? Poe shames this shoplifter by making 
her parade for 20 hours near the scene of her crime, the same way 
he shames this drunk driver who drove into and killed two people. 
The judge says it is time to quit pussyfooting around. It is humiliating, 
it is shameful. And a person has an opportunity for some self-reflection, 
and maybe they won't commit those crimes again. It works, says poe. 
69 of the 72 people he's shamed haven't showed back up in court again. 
Shame is one thing, say critics. Humiliation, quite another, adding 
when we rub someone's face in their punishment, we just might make 
someone worse. They're likely to become angry, irrational, aggressive, 
hostile. You're saying it's short-sighted? I think it's very short-sighted, 
yeah. Critics also argue that shaming doesn't work on people who have 
no sense of shame, like stonewalling politicians. Just imagine if 
Mr. Clinton were to come here? It all depends on how he comes to us. 
If he comes to us talking out the side of his neck, you know, mother 
love gonna be on his shoe tops! I would be on your shoe tops, Mr. 
president, with all due respect. With all due respect, many have decided, 
let's have some punishment which fits the crime. Bob Faw, "NBC news," 
Houston.
