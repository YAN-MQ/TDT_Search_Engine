Since the weather down south generally doesn't lend itself to a white 
christmas, some people look for ways to improvise that seasonal effect. 
John Zarrella has some pointers. South Florida. Early December. Average 
temperature -- mid 80s. The likelihood of Jack frost nipping at the 
door or a white Christmas -- slim to none. In Miami, this is how some 
people make it feel like the season. It's called flocking, covering 
your Christmas tree in snow-like goop. Now, in the northeast and midwest, 
you may not want to go to that extreme to get the Christmas spirit. 
But if the unusually warm weather has you worried your Christmas tree 
won't last until the 25th, here's some tips from the tropics -- a 
fresh cut is a Must. Keep the tree out of the sun. Put it in water 
immediately, and don't let it dry out. Once it does, the tree stops 
drinking for good. Tree preservatives are helpful, but there's not 
consensus on aspirin. It doesn't have a headache, so it doesn't need 
aspirin. Follow these rules, and your tree should last at least a 
month. Of course, some people have their own home remedies. I put 
some cotton, white cotton underneath. And don't wait to buy your tree 
until the last minute, thinking it will be fresher. Most trees, no 
matter when they come off the truck, were cut at the same time. Now, 
if you're still concerned your tree won't holdup, well, or course, 
you can go out and get an artificial one. But the folks who sell live 
trees will point out, that artificial trees are made of the same material 
as this toilet bowl brush. And as their motto says -- do you want 
to gather 'round 100 toilet bowl brushes in your home? John Zarrella, 
CNN, Miami.
