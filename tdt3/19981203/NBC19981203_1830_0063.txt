Good evening. We are creatures of the seasons. And this is the time 
of the year when the northern half of the country is arranging work, 
business and personal lives around colder weather. But not this December. 
With a little more than three weeks until Christmas, the climate more 
closely resembles may than December. In fact, there's record heat. 
And it is having a substantial effect on the normal rhythms of life 
and business. We begin with NBC's Anne Thompson on the day at the 
beach from the rocky mountains east. December 3rd, and it sure doesn't 
look like Christmas. Today, another day of record-setting highs. In 
fact, each day this week, as many as 20 major cities hit new marks, 
in many cases, melting away consumers' spending. I just haven't been 
in the mood at all, and I think it has to do with the weather. Almost 
a week into the Christmas shopping season, heavy coats and other winter 
apparel still Hang on racks. Analysts call outerwear sales "horrible," 
the dark cloud in an otherwise bright forecast. The weather-related 
merchandise is spoiling Christmas a bit. It's not going to make for 
a bad Christmas, but its going to spoil it a bit. In Chicago, 67 degrees. 
No reason to getaway at this travel agency. Business to warm weather 
destinations down 25%. There's nothing to motivate them to run, so 
they're all doing their thing and our sales our down. In Atlanta, 
it's convertible weather, 76 degrees. They're golfing in Minneapolis 
and basking in sunshine in Portland, Maine. Forecasters say it won't 
disappoint. Snow, the real kind, should make its way to the midwest 
and eastern United States in the next two weeks. The jetstream now 
hovering around the U.S. slash Canadian border will move south. The 
zero-degree temperatures that are up in Canada will be moving down 
to the northern tier of the states. So it will feel like a lot more 
like winter. Until then, at New York's Rockefeller plaza, under the 
world's most famous Christmas tree, zamboni driver David meltzer will 
do what he can to protect the ice from 60-degree weather. I'm starting 
to get spring fever and it's December already. But it won't last. 
Forecasters say typical December next week, in time to make it feel 
a lot more like Christmas. Anne Thompson, NBC news, Chicago.
