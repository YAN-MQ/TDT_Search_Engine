In a move to bolster lagging earnings, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the 
world's fifth-largest drug maker, announced Thursday that it would 
take an $800 million charge in the fourth quarter in part to close 
36 plants and cut 4,100 jobs, about 4 percent of its global work force. 
Eleven of the plants are in the United States. The cuts come as Johnson 
&AMP; Johnson, one of the most diversified companies in the pharmaceutical 
industry, struggles to keep pace with its competitors. In the third 
quarter, the company posted an 11 percent increase in earnings, one 
of the worst performances in the industry, while most of its competitors 
had gains of some 16 percent. Analysts were surprised Thursday not 
so much that Johnson &AMP; Johnson was reorganizing but that the cuts 
were so severe. In the next 12 to 18 months, the company will eliminate 
5,800 jobs worldwide, primarily in manufacturing, with 2,500 of those 
coming in the United States. At the same time, the company will add 
1,700 jobs, bringing the net reduction to 4,100 people. Some of the 
displaced people may fill the new positions. Even though Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson has three large divisions _ medical equipment, consumer products 
and pharmaceuticals _ the job cuts will not be evenly divided. Company 
executives confirmed Thursday that the pharmaceutical operations would 
largely be spared, with the majority of the job cuts coming from the 
medical devices and consumer products. That strategy virtually guarantees 
that few pink slips will be passed out at Johnson &AMP; Johnson's 
headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J. Company officials said late Thursday 
that of the 11,000 people who work in New Jersey, about 160 are expected 
to be laid off. Robert Darretta, Johnson &AMP; Johnson's chief financial 
officer, said late Thursday that the majority of job cuts were coming 
from the company's consumer and professional divisions because both 
units were being converted from primarily local to regional operations. 
The pharmaceutical division already largely functioned under a regional 
system, Darretta said. The job cuts, though, made up only half of 
the company's $800 million charge. Johnson &AMP; Johnson will write 
off $300 million of research and development with the company's $3.5 
billion acquisition of DePuy Inc., an orthopedics company. Darretta 
said the remaining $100 million consisted of miscellaneous charges, 
including $50 million to write off good will from several of the company's 
previous acquisitions. The reorganization should generate annual savings 
of $250 million to $300 million, the company said. Analysts said Thursday 
that the savings should bolster Johnson &AMP; Johnson's earnings gains 
to 14 percent a year, well ahead of its current pace. Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson's reorganization comes at an odd time for the company. Even 
though its third-quarter earnings gain was only half that of some 
of its competitors, investors recently sent the company's shares to 
record highs. Analysts said anxious investors had traditionally bought 
shares in Johnson &AMP; Johnson because the company was a consistent 
performer during periods of market volatility. Yet, even with the 
investor frenzy, there had always been a hint of trouble within the 
company. Last month, Johnson &AMP; Johnson announced that it would 
not meet its $3 a share earnings forecast for 1999. That only raised 
more criticism on Wall Street that the company's diverse products, 
which include the world's largest line of medical equipment and Band-Aid 
adhesive bandages, was taking valuable resources away from its high-margin 
pharmaceuticals. Nowhere was that more evident than the company's 
stock. Even though Johnson &AMP; Johnson's stock hit record highs 
this year, it could not match its competitors' gains. The company's 
shares have increased 20.8 percent so far this year, compared with 
82.4 percent for Warner-Lambert and 47.9 percent for Pfizer. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's drug index is up 44 percent. Johnson &AMP; Johnson's 
shares closed Thursday at $79.5625, down 93.75 cents. The market had 
closed before the company's announcement. ``Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
is just starting to feel some of the setbacks from some of their businesses,'' 
said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners, a biopharmaceutical 
investment research company in New York. ``The over-the-counter drug 
business is only growing at 1 percent annually. Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
can close some of these plants and not lose any efficiency.'' While 
analysts generally applauded Johnson &AMP; Johnson's reorganization, 
Darretta denied that the company's realignment had anything to do 
with its competitors' sizzling earnings performances. ``This was not 
related to our competition at all,'' he said. ``I have no idea what 
this realignment will do to our stock price tomorrow. But what I do 
know is that because of it our company will have a stronger future.''
