We've got plenty more goodies in the mailbag this week. Dick Thomas 
from Lancaster, California wrote in asking us "why in a geography 
quiz did you call the country Holland?". Mr., Thomas says, "When he 
lived there North Holland and South Holland were states of a country 
The Netherlands". He asks, " Has that change?". No. Nowadays, Holland 
is used in the same way as The Netherlands. It's exactly the same 
thing. That's Anna Van Heter of The Netherlands Board of Tourism. 
Holland used to be the wealthiest province of The Netherlands in the 
17th Century. But nowadays, people use Holland and The Netherlands 
for our whole country.
