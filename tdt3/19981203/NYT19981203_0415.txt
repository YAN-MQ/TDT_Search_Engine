When L. Daniel Jorndt, the chief executive of the Walgreen Co., wanted 
to know how big the parking lot was at a rival Wal-Mart store, he 
had a look for himself. ``The store is 440 yards away, a quarter of 
a mile'' from where he parked his car, he exclaimed in a recent interview 
at the Walgreen headquarters in this Chicago suburb. ``I've paced 
it myself.'' Jorndt, who is 57, is far from intimidated by the vastness 
of Wal-Mart stores and their parking lots. On the contrary, he aims 
to turn their size to his advantage by emphasizing the convenience 
of ducking into the corner Walgreens for small purchases. Indeed, 
convenience is why his company is pushing to install drive-through 
pharmacies at its 2,600 outlets. But as his inspection of the Wal-Mart 
lot shows, he believes that attention to detail is the key to making 
that strategy work. Never mind that Walgreen is the nation's largest 
drugstore chain, with more than 90,000 employees and $15 billion in 
revenue. Name any major city, and Jorndt can tell you exactly where 
the Walgreens are found, or not found, and why. One possible location 
in Rye, N.Y., didn't make the cut because of concerns over a nearby 
traffic signal. ``That light was just too slow,'' he said. ``By the 
time it turned, people would have decided to go elsewhere.'' (The 
light stayed red for 90 seconds; he wanted 30.) A pharmacist who rose 
through the ranks at the company, Jorndt does not favor blurry vision 
or blurry language. He is crisp, clear and direct. Occasionally, he 
pounds his fist on the desk to emphasize a point. He says things like: 
``The groceries can't fight Wal-Mart,'' ``We want to be on the right 
side of the street'' and ``The strip center is dead.'' He is dead 
serious about that last point; his company is pulling out of such 
malls, creating free-standing stores that are part drugstore, part 
food mart. The new format will let it better compete with CVS and 
Rite Aid drugstores. Jorndt's office reflects his penchant for precision. 
His desk looks as though it is polished hourly. Gracing the bookshelves 
are photographs of his wife, Patricia, and their three children _ 
as well as one of Michael Jordan. Lean and tall, Jorndt easily turns 
on the charm, yet makes no secret of his aversion to the news media. 
He refused to be interviewed for a profile in The Chicago Tribune 
in January, so the paper relied on recollections of acquaintances, 
like the high-school quarterback who described him as a trusted blocker. 
Jorndt limited the interview for this article to 15 minutes and, with 
two minutes to go, commanded: ``You've got one more question.'' Jorndt, 
the first chief executive appointed from outside the Walgreen family, 
wants to more than double the chain's number of stores, to about 6,000, 
by 2010. Success will be in the details. ``Our average store pushes 
$600 per square foot,'' Jorndt said, referring to yearly sales. ``That's 
almost double the industry.'' The staff is equally precise. A real 
estate team of numbers crunchers measures traffic patterns and population 
movements, as well as age and income levels. ``America's aging,'' 
Jorndt said. ``And as you age, you buy more prescriptions. ``Bill 
Clinton's group is hitting middle age, and this will drive prescription 
use for the next 40 years.'' Jorndt has charts that illustrate that 
aging population and track its flight to warmer climates. So where 
is the company expanding? California. Texas. Florida. Arizona. Georgia. 
``This is just the leading edge,'' he said. Walgreen is certainly 
on a tear: The stock price has tripled the last three years; earnings 
are up and revenues are booming, with sales at stores open at least 
a year 11 percent higher than a year ago. Jorndt and his researchers 
have also identified ``trade areas'' _ locales for Walgreens with 
the right demographics and the right traffic patterns. Jorndt wants 
busy intersections that are convenient for 15,000-square-foot rectangular 
stores, fitted with easy-to-navigate drive-through windows for prescription 
pickups. He calls such spots the ``corner of Main and Main.'' It was 
on such a corner on the South Side of Chicago that the first Walgreens 
was erected in 1901, selling drugs, surgical dressings, potions, lotions 
and the like. And it was on such a corner that Jorndt got his start 
as a pharmacist. L. Daniel Jorndt (a colleague says he won't reveal 
what the ``L'' stands for) grew up in Chicago, one of three sons born 
to a teacher and a nurse. He went to Drake University in Des Moines, 
where he earned a degree in pharmacy. He filled prescriptions for 
Walgreens before being promoted to district manager, went on to earn 
his MBA at the University of New Mexico and was named the company's 
president in 1990. His task now is to steer Walgreen's course through 
an industry where margins are being squeezed by managed health care. 
Americans have more prescriptions than ever, but drugstores are keeping 
less and less in profits. ``The pharmacy isn't what it used to be,'' 
Jorndt said. ``Six pharmacies close every day.'' He won't expand through 
acquisitions, he said, but will continue to invest heavily in technology 
that keeps inventories low and automates operations. The goal is to 
lure prescription customers into buying more profitable nondrug products. 
``If you want a pack of razor blades or a stick of deodorant, the 
last place you want to go is a 150,000-square-foot mass merchant or 
the Mall of America,'' he said. And so, when it can, Walgreen will 
park a drugstore at the corner of Main and Main, or even at the intersection 
of an interstate and state highway, close to Wal-Mart's daunting parking 
lots. ``We can live off the crumbs on their table,'' Jorndt said with 
a smile. ``They won't even feel us. We'll be like a gnat on the rear 
end of an elephant.''
