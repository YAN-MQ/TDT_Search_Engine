Director Gus Van Sant says his new film called "Psycho" is not just 
another remake. No, Mr. Van Sant calls his "Psycho" more of a tribute 
than a remake. He also calls it an anti-remake film. It was inspired 
by the 1960 movie, "Psycho," a murder suspense film directed by the 
late and legendary Alfred Hitchcock. Mr. Van Sant says he does not 
have much faith in the ability of Hollywood to do remakes. I'm with 
him on that one. I am. I've never seen a real good one. He criticizes 
filmmakers who take the movies that are well done and change the dialogue 
and shots. He said he's not going to do that. He's going to - And, 
in fact, I saw him interviewed one day. He says that this is shot 
frame by frame and with the exact same script. No changes. Well, I 
appreciate what he says in terms of it being, you know, more of a 
tribute and anti-remake film, but, you know, one does question if 
you're going to do it that way, then why do it at all? Now we do know 
that this is in color; the original was in black and white, but there's 
a lot... But you can also color. He'd be glad to colorize it for you. 
And there's a lot to be said for black and white as part of the presentation, 
as part of the story. I thought that was one of the things that made 
the original "Psycho" so scary. Yeah. It was a truly frightening film. 
And I don't think anybody can top Tony Perkins playing the weird guy. 
That's the truth. That's the weirdest role I think I've ever seen.
