The World Bank in its annual economic outlook says the world faces 
a substantial risk of falling into recession in the new year, especially 
if Japan's efforts with economic recovery fail. World Bank economist 
say the global economy will grow 1.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent 
in 1999. But if Japan cleans up the debts weighing down its banking 
system, the world's economy can grow as much as 2.7 percent in 2000. 
The alternative to that is no growth next year and only a slightly 
better scenario in 2000. The Asian crisis is hurting the global economy 
with falling commodity prices and exports. World Bank chief economist, 
Joseph Stigwet says developing countries are affected in several ways. 
One of them is this huge terms afraid affect. So a country like Chile 
that may be pursuing very good economic policy, its price of copper 
falls, it's going to be adversely affected. The oil exporting countries, 
regardless of whether they were pursuing good or bad economic policies, 
and some of them were pursuing bad economic policies and some of them 
were pursuing good economic policies, had been very, very badly affected. 
Mr. Stigwet says that because of very low oil prices, even per capital 
incomes in the Middle East to North Africa have fallen this year.
