This is VOA News Now from Washington. I'm Erin Brummett along with 
Tony Riggs. Fifty years ago in December, 1948, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights was signed in Paris. The anniversary has been marked 
by the release of the annual report from the group Human Rights Watch. 
The study notes improvement in a number of countries, especially the 
former Soviet Union, Latin America, South Africa, and parts of Asia. 
However, singled out for criticism for having repressive governments 
were Burma, China, Iraq, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Turkmenistan. 
Afghanistan was listed as one of the world's most intractable disasters 
because of public executions and severe restrictions on women by the 
ruling Taliban. In another report, the Observatory for the Protection 
of Human Rights says defenders of human rights face the greatest risk 
in Afghanistan, Burma, North Korea, and Iraq.
