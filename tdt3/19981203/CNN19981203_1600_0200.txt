Another launch attempt for space shuttle "endeavour" is scheduled 
for tomorrow at 3:36 A.M. eastern time. An alarm caused enough of 
a delay to push "endeavour" beyond its ten-minute launch window this 
morning. The planned historic liftoff had to be scrubbed. Searching 
for the cause of the master alarm cost precious time, and the countdown 
could not be resumed quickly enough. "Endeavour" is on a significant 
mission. It will be the first one NASA has designated for the construction 
of the new international space station. Mission directors explained 
that "endeavour" must launch between a window of a specific time, 
because it must hit a specific trajectory to reach the orbit set for 
the space station. The zarya, which is the Russian Module, was launched 
two weeks ago. What we have to do is wait until the earth rotates 
underneath the orbital plane of the zarya. So it is a tricky thing 
to do. It limited us to only 3 minutes and 42 seconds.
