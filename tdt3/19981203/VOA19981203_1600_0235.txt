Forty-four countries have agreed to return Nazi-confiscated art and 
property to survivors of the Holocaust and families of victims. At 
the close of a three-day international conference on the return of 
Holocaust-era assets, delegates called on museums, art dealers, and 
governments to search through archives to investigate origins of stolen 
art. A centralized data bank will be set up and posted on the Internet. 
Unpaid insurance plans will also be settled.
