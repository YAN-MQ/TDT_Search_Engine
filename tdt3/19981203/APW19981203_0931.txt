The EU head office denied Thursday it planned to propose a telephone 
tax to help fund the European Union and its ambitious aspirations 
to take in a dozen newcomers. In a statement it said a story to that 
effect in the German tabloid daily Bild ``is wrong.'' Spokeswoman 
Martine Reichert said the commission had looked at studies dealing 
with new income for the EU. One mentioned a ``communications'' or 
``telephone tax'' but that had been dismissed as unrealistic. ``There 
is no proposal whatsoever of the commission in this context,'' Reichert 
added. The urgency with which the EU head office denied the report 
follows the emergence of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's leftist government 
in Germany that has led to a split among EU members about tax issues. 
Schroeder favors EU governments deciding on such issues by majority 
voting. EU rules now require unanimous decisions and Britain and other 
EU members want to keep it that way. In Britain's tabloid press has 
been on a virulent crusade of late against German Finance Minister 
Oskar Lafontaine, calling him Europe's ``most dangerous man.'' The 
EU's annual budget _ some dlrs 100 billion this year _ is funded largely 
through sales tax contributions and a flat fee that reflects each 
EU member's gross national product. Pressure is rising to find a new 
source of income as the EU looks at taking in 12 newcomers in the 
decade ahead.
