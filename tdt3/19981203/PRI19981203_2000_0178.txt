The World Council of Churches is meeting in Harriere, the capital 
of Zimbabwe. The council represents most Christian denominates except 
Roman Catholic and meets every eight years. But, as Joseph Winter 
reports there are growing divisions over homosexuality and the ordination 
of woman priests. The World Council of Churches was created 50 years 
ago with the idea of bringing some unity to Christianity. Now however, 
issues; such as the ordination of woman priests and homosexuality, 
threaten to split the movement between western liberals and conservatives, 
in particular Orthodox churches from Eastern Europe. Officials play 
down the possibility, saying it is not meant to be a unified structure 
like the Catholic church, so it does have to adopt an official position 
on such questions. Joseph Winter, BBC News, Harriere.
