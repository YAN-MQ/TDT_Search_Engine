Now, "your money" and the military. More than 8 million soldiers, 
their families and retirees get free health care from the U.S. military. 
But when something goes wrong with the care, military doctors are 
also provided for. They don't pay for malpractice insurance. They 
don't need it. When a patient sues, "it's your money" that foots the 
Bill. Here's ABC's James Walker. August 1996 -- emy mills' abdominal 
pain is growing worse. I told my husband, you know, "I really have 
a lot of pain still." He said, "okay, you need to go to the doctor." 
She went to the Evans army hospital in Colorado springs. Ob/gyn, may 
I help you? Her specialist at the well women's clinic immediately 
discovered what he thought was the problem. Doctors found growths 
on her uterus, so they decided to perform a Hysterectomy. But the 
two-hour operation turned into seven when the surgeons made a Horrifying 
discovery. Emy mills had ovarian cancer in an advanced stage. It had 
been spreading for years. Then 12 days later, the mills made the worst 
discovery of all. New document as peared in emy's medical file. That 
page you're looking at right there caught my eye right quick. Results 
of a cancer spit in Li, relt that swed she had cancer in 1992, results 
that were never passed on. If they caught this back then, her chances 
of survival would have been a Lot higher than they are now. They've 
given her 20% for the next five years, survival rate. The mills sued 
the army and won $200,000. It's a small portion of the $75 million 
that taxpayers shell out every year to settle military malpractice 
cases. The Pentagon refused to talk to us about its malpractice problem. 
But it has said the rate of lawsuits in the military is lower than 
among civilian doctors. Most military malpractice case involve misdiagnose 
igs or deadly surgical mistakes and like the mills, medical reports 
that got lost. If we'd gotten the care we should have gotten, this 
would never have happened. And we could today maybe have a child, 
a 2 or 3-year-old running around the house. James Walker, ABC News, 
Colorado springs.
