From Public Radio International, this is The World, a co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH Boston. It's Thursday, December 
3rd. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. Today, Israel's battle front in Arab 
East Jerusalem, on The West Bank, in Southern Lebanon, and in the 
war for public opinion. African churches combine the indigenous styles 
of worship with that old time religion. It is still there what the 
missionaries left, but what has happened is that African have taken 
that Christianity and shaped it to suit themselves. Also for American 
motorist, it's saving time. And in Britain, it's pantomime time. Oh, 
no, it isn't. Oh, yes, it is. After this news.
