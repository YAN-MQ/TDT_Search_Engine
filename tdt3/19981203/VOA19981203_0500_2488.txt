Former U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy has been cleared of all 
charges after a four-year independent counsel probe. He had been accused 
of accepting illegal gifts from some of the companies his department 
was regulating. VOA's Jim Malone reports. Mike Espy was the first 
African-American appointed to head the Agriculture Department in 1993 
by President Clinton. But Mr. Espy was forced to resign his post in 
1994 after allegations that he accepted about $35,000 in illegal gifts, 
including tickets to professional football and basketball games from 
lobbyists representing companies regulated by the Agriculture Department. 
But on Wednesday, a federal grand jury here in Washington found Mr. 
Espy not guilty on all 30 charges against him, and the relieved Mike 
Espy spoke briefly with reporters. I stood before the jury several 
months ago and said that I was not guilty. I don't believe I lost 
my good name because I never believed that I was guilty of anything. 
The verdicts in the Espy case come after a four-year independent counsel 
probe which cost $17 million. Independent counsel Donald Smalt says 
while he's disappointed with the outcome of the Espy trial, he believes 
his investigation has sent a clear message to both government regulators 
and lobbyists. If our investigations and prosecutions dissuade corporations 
from giving gifts to their regulators, and the regulators from accepting 
gifts from those who are regulated, I believe that the costs we have 
incurred are worth the price. Mr. Espy was the first Cabinet-level 
official to stand trial since President Reagan's Labor secretary, 
Raymond Donovan, who was acquitted of corruption charges Northern 
Ireland 1987. Mr. Espy, who previously served as a Democratic congressman 
from Mississippi says he's unsure if he wants to return to public 
service. Jim Malone, VOA News, Washington.
