Marijuana farmers in St. Vincent sent a letter to President Clinton 
on Thursday complaining a planned U.S. military operation to destroy 
their crops will cause hardship. ``To take this out of our economy 
overnight would bring hardship and endless misery on our people,'' 
said Junior Cottle, president of the Concerned Citizens, Marijuana 
Farmers and Supporters. The group delivered the letter to the U.S. 
Embassy in Barbados. Cottle said some 8,000 of the islands' 119,000 
people depend on marijuana for their livelihoods. The crop was a ``political 
stabilizer'' as important to the economy as the banana industry, Cottle 
said. ``There is a significant portion of our people who detest your 
intrusion and demand compensation for your action,'' the group wrote. 
Marijuana farmers staged a demonstration against the crackdown in 
downtown Kingstown last week, and picketed Prime Minister James Mitchell's 
office. Mitchell has said he fears U.S. officials would retaliate 
by banning Vincentians from entering the United States if the country 
cuts back on eradication efforts. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is 
the largest marijuana exporter in the Eastern Caribbean, according 
to the U.N. International Drug Control Program. St. Vincent police, 
U.S. troops and the Regional Security System, a cooperative of Eastern 
Caribbean police forces, plan to use U.S. helicopters in an operation 
to destroy hundreds of marijuana plots in the country next week. Since 
1994, police have destroyed more than 8.2 million marijuana plants 
here. Marijuana is illegal in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, but 
the plant has been cultivated for years in remote forests and dozens 
of isolated cays. Popularly called ``ganja,'' it is the most popular 
drug in the Caribbean and the only one cultivated in the region, according 
to the U.N. anti-drug program. In February, the prime minister of 
nearby Grenada rejected calls by Rastafarians to legalize marijuana 
in that country. Followers of Rastafarianism smoke marijuana as a 
religious rite.
