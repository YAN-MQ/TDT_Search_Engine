In the most coordinated action yet toward European monetary union, 
11 nations simultaneously cut their interest rates Thursday to a nearly 
uniform low level. The move came a month before the nations are to 
adopt the euro as a single currency and marked a drastic shift in 
policy. As recently as two months ago, European central bankers had 
adamantly refused to lower rates because they were intent on establishing 
the credibility of the euro and the fledgling European Central Bank 
in world markets. But on Thursday, citing signs that the global economic 
slowdown has begun to chill Europe, the central banks of the 11 euro-zone 
nations reduced their benchmark interest rates by at least three-tenths 
of a percent. The cuts are intended to help bolster the European economies 
by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. When 
the dust settled, every country in the euro zone except Italy had 
reduced its key interest rate to 3.0 percent. Germany's powerful Bundesbank, 
which has long been the benchmark for all the others, cut its basic 
rate from 3.3 percent. Italy, which has had some of the highest rates 
in Europe, dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. The key rates are 
comparable to the Federal Funds rate in the United States, the target 
rate for overnight loans between banks, which is now 4.75 percent. 
``Convergence is now complete,'' said Holger Fahrinkrug, head of Economic 
Research at the Frankfurt office of Warburg Dillon Read. ``We have 
arrived.'' Though most economists had expected the new European Central 
Bank to lower interest rates early next year, almost everybody was 
surprised when the national central banks settled the issue before 
the new bank officially assumed responsibility for European monetary 
policy. The decision came after months of bitter and public battles 
between Europe's conservative central bankers and the left-of-center 
governments that are in power in most countries. The angriest battles 
have been in Germany, where Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has 
waged a relentless public campaign to persuade the Bundesbank and 
the European Central Bank to lower rates. In announcing the decision, 
Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, said Thursday that 
the central bankers had acted in response to mounting evidence that 
European growth rates will be significantly slower next year than 
they had predicted as recently as last summer. ``Our basic estimation 
is that there will be a measurable slowdown, but there won't be a 
recession,'' he told reporters. But he adamantly denied accusations 
that the decision was a response to political pressure. ``We are deaf 
to political pressure, but we are not blind to facts and arguments,'' 
Tietmeyer said. Lafontaine, preparing to board a plane for the United 
States, said quickly on Thursday that he was pleased. ``Over all, 
I'm satisfied,'' he said. ``We saw how the crises in Asia were not 
without impact. On that basis we welcome this step.'' Most economists 
argued Thursday that the central bankers had strong reasons for opening 
the monetary spigots a bit. Even though Germany reported Thursday 
that its economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, government 
and industry economists have been lowering their projections for next 
year. Meanwhile, Europe's already low inflation rate has declined 
even further in the last year. In Germany, where annual inflation 
has dropped to seven-tenths of a percent from 1.8 percent so far this 
year, many experts say the country is already on the brink of at least 
a mild deflation. ``I think it's a brave decision,'' said Kermit L. 
Schoenholtz, global economist at Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``There 
are many who feared that the extensive criticism from political policymakers 
would prevent the European Central Bank from taking action because 
they would be worried about being seen as responding to political 
pressure.
