When we come back, two prominent historians with us tonight to answer 
the question -- just how bad are these times we're in? D death. John 
was brilliant. We'll miss his brilliant conversations. John knew everything. 
We'll miss his knowledge. John wrote that consolidated contract. He 
didn't even tell us where he put it. Now they're really consumed with 
grief. If only they knew John scanned all of his documents... into 
the Xerox document center. He made them digital and put every last 
one of them on the company website. I wonder what John would do in 
this situation. He'd check your website to see if the Xerox document 
center... scanned in the consolidated contract. Hey, I just had a 
thought. Oh, there's a good place to start. You don't think John scanned 
the contract into the, uh, T-- the Xerox document center. Xerox document 
center, do you? John was smart, but he wasn't that smart. Ooohhh! 
I don't think John liked that. Why is our company tagline a question? 
I ac tually just start on Monday. So I really don't kno well, you 
can't make software better... until you know wh people want to do

You pick it U you call somebody... things we never wou have imagined.

work trying to keep up with yo imagination. I design softwa for people 
like my da my mother, my neighbors. What gets you up in the morning? 
What are you passionate about Woman: it has to be for kids, for all 
different typ of people to use it. What if your comput could talk 
to you what if your comput turned on like a Lamp so our tagline. In 
part, it's an invitation to you. In part, it's a question because... 
we really need to know the answe so, we'll ask it agai
