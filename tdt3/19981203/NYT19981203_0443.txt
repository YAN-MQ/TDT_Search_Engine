Markets throughout Latin America plunged Thursday after the Brazilian 
Congress voted down an increase in pension contributions by public 
workers, delivering an unexpected blow to the government's pledges 
of economic reform. The vote in Brazil's Lower House late Wednesday 
threw out a measure to increase from 11 percent to 20 percent the 
pension payments of civil servants earning more than $960 a month. 
As the defeat represented the loss of an estimated $2.2 billion in 
revenues, the vote's damage was both politically and psychologically 
severe. Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, has been under enormous 
pressure to cut its deficit in order to avoid the same kind of financial 
crises that ensnared Southeast Asian economies more than a year ago, 
the start of an economic virus that has repeatedly shaken financial 
markets and raised fears of a severe global downturn. For investors 
and political analysts, the vote in Brazil signaled trouble ahead 
for a raft of proposals to reduce government spending and raise taxes, 
designed to make the country solvent. The defeat is also raising concerns 
about Brazil's ability to meet the terms of its agreement for a $41.5 
billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. The loan has been 
crucial to offsetting fears of an economic meltdown in Brazil that 
would affect the rest of Latin America and even sounder economies 
in the United States and Canada. With more than 160 million people, 
Brazil concentrates more than half the population of South America 
in a country bigger than the continental United States. Thanks to 
a slew of privatizations in recent years, it is home to $36 billion 
in direct foreign investment. Its size and weight make it the undeniable 
leader in Latin America, the market for about 20 percent of U.S. exports. 
Despite a round of coordinated interest-rate cuts throughout Europe, 
markets throughout Latin America on Thursday skidded in reaction to 
the defeat in Brasilia. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the market fell 8.8 
percent, while Argentina's Merval plummeted 6.5 percent. In Mexico 
the market dropped 3 percent, while Chile's market fell 1.9 percent. 
The rampant selling in Latin America also rattled the stock market 
in the United States, where the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 
184.86 points or 2.04 percent to 8,879.68. The Brazilian Congress 
had been expected to grant President Fernando Henrique Cardoso broad 
support to carry out deep reforms. In the past, Congress has supported 
the government in moments of economic crisis, most recently after 
Thailand's financial collapse last year. ``This was something that 
wasn't supposed to happen,'' said Desmond Lachman, head of emerging-markets 
economic research at Solomon Smith Barney. ``It's raising questions 
about the ease with which they can pass the rest of their package.'' 
Alexandre Barros, a Brasilia-based political consultant, said future 
reforms would likely take more political maneuvering to win approval. 
The defections came from within the president's own party _ with 25 
deputies voting against the measure _ and from an allied party led 
by former Sao Paulo mayor Paulo Maluf. ``This is just the beginning 
of a rough road ahead,'' Barros said. A recent scandal, featuring 
secret recordings of conversations in which government ministers appeared 
to be favoring another former official in the auction of Brazil's 
phone system last summer, has heightened skepticism toward the Cardoso 
administration. Earlier this week the first lady was booed when she 
visited a university in Rio de Janeiro, with students throwing money 
and coins at her. ``The honeymoon's over,'' Barros said. The International 
Monetary Fund, which had announced just an hour after the congressional 
vote that it would release an initial $5.3 billion slice of the bailout 
loan, issued no formal statement following the congressional defeat. 
A spokesman told Reuters that the IMF was ``looking at the situation.'' 
Under the terms of its agreement with the IMF, Brazil must produce 
a surplus in its primary accounts _ government expenses less debt 
service _ amounting to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product next 
year. The government had presented a $23.5 billion package of budget 
cuts and increases in taxes to demonstrate its ability to reduce the 
deficit. The Brazilian budget deficit has blown up to 7 percent of 
GDP, or more than $55 billion. Its reforms were designed to bring 
down interest rates and shrink the budget deficit to 4.7 percent next 
year. Sergio Amaral, a spokesman for the president, told reporters 
that the failure to approve increased pension contributions would 
mean ``more cuts in public-works projects, and reductions in transfer 
payments to the states and municipalities.'' Paulo Ferraz, president 
of Banco Bozzano Simonsen, said the markets had overreacted to the 
bill's defeat, and that he did not believe the vote spelled the end 
_ or even the delay _ of government reform. ``Markets tend to be extremely 
pessimistic or optimistic all the time,'' Ferraz said. ``Our view 
has been that those things take time, but they're all going to be 
implemented in time.''
