Investors snapped up the initial public offering of Ticketmaster Online-City 
Search Inc., an online seller of tickets and city guides, sending 
its shares as high as four times their offering price. Ticketmaster 
shares closed at $40.25 in Nasdaq trading, after trading as high as 
$56.38. Because the shares opened at $52, many investors who bought 
in the first hour of trading lost money on the stock. The company 
sold seven million shares at $14 each on Wednesday, up from the $11 
to $13 range set by the lead underwriter, Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities 
LLC. Thanks to a ticker-symbol mix-up, the initial public offering 
of Ticketmaster also prompted an unusual flurry of trading in the 
shares of Temco Service Industries, a provider of building maintenance 
and security services. Temco shares, which trade under the symbol 
tcmo, and traded under the symbol tcms prior to Oct. 7, soared as 
high as $65 before investors realized they were not buying Ticketmaster, 
which now uses tcms. Temco shares closed at $25.50, down $3.25, in 
over-the-counter trading. At $40.25, Ticketmaster's 69.5 million shares 
outstanding give it a market valuation of $2.80 billion. Lisa Allen, 
an analyst with Forrester Research, said Ticketmaster needed to distinguish 
itself from other online city guides, but added that ``event ticketing 
is going to be one of the key drivers for electronic commerce.'' Forrester 
estimates online ticket purchases growing from $115 million this year 
to $2.75 billion by 2003, Ms. Allen said. Ticketmaster, however, needs 
to find better ways to link its city guides with the ticket business, 
Ms. Allen added.
