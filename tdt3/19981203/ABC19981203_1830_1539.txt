Finally tonight -- a story about good intentions and point of view. 
Here in New York, a controversy has arisen after a young white teacher 
read an award-winning book to her third grade class. But the tile 
of the book is a term that some people find offensive -- "Nappy hair." 
Here's ABC's Michelle Norris. The controversy focuses on a children's 
book about a little girl named Brenda, who has, "the kinkiest, the 
nappiest, the fuzziest, the most screwed-up, squeezed-up, knotted-up, 
tangled-up hair you've ever seen." In the book, Brenda is taught to 
be proud of her unruly mane, because it represents the strength and 
resilience of her people. I'm trying to tell children how delightful 
nappy hair is. It was a book of delight and celebration and praise 
for the nappy-headed child. At ps 75 in Brooklyn, a young white teacher 
read the book to her class of black and Hispanic third graders. Nappy 
hair was a tool I used on teaching self-esteem and pride. But some 
parents at the school reacted with outrage and accused sherman of 
being racially insensitive. They felt that children were being taught 
to hate themselves. It stirred up the whole feeling of self-hate and 
self-rejection. Despite its positive message, the book struck a nerve 
among some parents nerve, especially when children grow up in a society 
where the prevalent standard of beauty revolves around long, straight 
and flowing hair. For some, the problem was not just what was being 
taught, but who was teaching it. I think she stumbled onto some kind 
of race secret, something that black people talk about and use as 
an epithet -- nappy hair. It had to be because she's white. If she 
were a black teacher teaching that book, it wouldn't have been no 
problem. Sherman said she even received threats, and because of that, 
has decided to change schools, even though her students and the staff 
have begged her to return. And they want to get me back. And they 
even said they would protect me. Why aren't the parents eaking out 
about what's inside the head? What's under the hair? Hair shmair. 
What's going on in terms of educating these kids? What are the reading 
scores in that school? At ps 75, only 1% of the students read at grade 
level. Michele Norris, ABC News, New York.
