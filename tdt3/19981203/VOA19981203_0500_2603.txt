U.N. officials say Iraq has again refused to hand over a document 
on banned chemical weapons the chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler 
demanded by November 30th. The official said Wednesday an Iraqi letter 
to Mr. Butler says his inspectors can only look at portions of the 
document Iraq considers relevant. In Paris Wednesday, Mr. Butler met 
with French diplomats who say he thinks a key report on Iraqi disarmament 
may be completed and can be completed despite Baghdad's refusal to 
hand over the document. The diplomats say Mr. Butler believes Iraqi 
cooperation in allowing U.N. inspectors access to suspected weapons 
site has been satisfactory.
