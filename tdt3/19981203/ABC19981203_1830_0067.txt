Good evening. We begin tonight with a story that makes you wonder 
about the integrity of sports, in particular, college sports. In Chicago 
today, a federal grand jury has indicted four former northwestern 
University football players and charged them with lying about their 
role in an alleged gambling scheme, that involved players trying to 
lose games and lose them badly in order to make money. ABC's chief 
investigative correspondent Brian Ross reports from Chicago. Federal 
authorities say this fumble by a member of the 1994 northwestern football 
team was no mistake, what it was according to today's federal grand 
jury indictment was a fix, part of an effort by the northwestern team 
to lose the game by more than the bookies expected. What's known as 
point shaving. According to the indictment, the northwestern players 
lied about their role in the point shaving scheme and about betting 
against their own team with on-campus bookies, who, FBI agents say, 
are tied to mob bookies in New York. We recognize there are student 
bookies on every campus in America. We need to prove to society that 
this is not a victimless crime. This is the second time this year 
that athletes from northwestern, located just outside Chicago, have 
been implicated in fixed games. Just last week, three more former 
college athletes, including Kevin pendergast and star northwestern 
basketball player Dion Lee, were sentenced to short prison terms for 
trying to fix several big ten games during the 1994-95 season. I actually 
disgraced, you know, the game, my school, you know, my teammates, 
you know, myself. As part of their plea agreement, Lee and pendergast 
have been speaking at colleges around the country about what can happen 
when players get in deep debt with bookies. I'd gone from one $50 
bet to calling the bookie two or three times a day on a Saturday, 
two or three times a day on a Sunday, and betting hundreds of dollars 
each weekend day during the football season. In Dion Lee's case, he 
says he figured the team would lose anyway, so why not lose by more 
and take care of his gambling debts? I took money to affect the outcome 
of one of our games. I mean, we were losing, always losing. Authorities 
say northwestern is far from the only school with a Serious on-campus 
gambling problem, but there's no doubt these are not the kind of highlights 
people in college sports are proud of. Brian Ross, ABC News, Chicago.
