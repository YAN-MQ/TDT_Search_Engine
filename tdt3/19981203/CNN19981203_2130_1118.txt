College football coaching changes, next in "Headline Sports." Hi, 
I'm expecting a fax. Room 212 wants the ammunition to deal with her 
toughest clients. Nothing? Davies, 212. I called earlier. Right, fax. 
It hasn't come yet. I need it for a meeting. Excuse me, miss Davies? 
It just came in. Thank you, so much. Good morning, everyone. Business 
services by Marriott. You look awful. Sinus pressure, huh? You know 
how Advil handles your tough pain fast? Well, Advil cold & sinus handles 
tough sinus pain fast. This is in this, plus a decongestant. That's 
why they call it Advil cold & sinus.
