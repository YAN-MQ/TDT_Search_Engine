As House Republicans push toward a vote to impeach President Clinton, 
not only is public sentiment overwhelmingly against them, but so are 
many prominent Republicans across the country. Republicans on the 
House Judiciary Committee say there is credible evidence that the 
president committed perjury and other impeachable offenses. Moreover, 
they say they are duty bound to follow a constitutionally established 
process and cannot be swayed by public opinion. ``The guys who have 
the constitutional and historical responsibility are us,'' said Rep. 
Christopher Cannon, a Utah Republican on the committee. A large majority 
of House Republicans seem inclined to follow the panel's lead. Most 
come from safe districts _ only 10 House Republicans won their races 
in November with 52 percent or less _ and consequently few face repercussions 
from constituents by voting for impeachment. Indeed, many Republicans 
face pressure to satisfy their conservative base or what lawmakers 
call the subtle urgings of a top House Republican leader, Rep. Tom 
DeLay of Texas. But a growing number of Republican governors, mayors 
and state party officials are expressing reservations about the Republican-led 
inquiry or outright opposition to impeachment. Gov. John Rowland of 
Connecticut, a former three-term Republican congressman, said in an 
interview on Thursday: ``Did Clinton do something wrong and lie? Yes. 
But does impeaching the president serve any public good? The answer 
is absolutely not.'' ``Now is the time for Congress to get past this 
issue,'' said Rowland, who added that the House should censure Clinton. 
``They should focus on the Asian financial crisis, Social Security, 
improving the quality of life, and on being civil again.'' Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani of New York City, who believes the accusations against Clinton 
do not amount to impeachable offenses, said last month: ``The rush 
to impeachment by Republicans has been very, very harmful to us.'' 
Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts was equally blunt: ``I don't think 
it's helping the Republican Party.'' Other Republican leaders, like 
Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, a former state attorney general, expressed 
doubts about how the Judiciary Committee has conducted its investigation: 
``I've been somewhat concerned that the process is less judicial than 
what I thought it should be.'' The committee's zigzagging over the 
past two weeks _ into Clinton's 1996 campaign finance practices and 
allegations that the president groped a White House volunteer in 1993 
_ has perplexed many party faithful. ``Every time there's a new twist, 
it confuses people about the mission of the Judiciary Committee,'' 
said Greg Brock, executive director of the Michigan Republican State 
Committee. Many other Republican leaders voice concern that the inquiry 
and impending votes in the House not only risk drawing a backlash 
from a scandal-weary public, but also may distract the party from 
important legislative priorities, from tax cuts to shoring up Social 
Security. ``We have to get this over with as soon as possible,'' said 
Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. ``The voters are sick to death of 
partisanship. We need to move on and develop a strong offense, based 
on a strong policy message.'' Mayor Brent Coles of Boise, Idaho, the 
ranking Republican in the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said in an interview 
Thursday: ``It does seem to me that we're talking about it way too 
much. Whatever the House's job is, they must do it quickly. Get in, 
get out, and do it post-haste.'' Even Republican officials who remain 
neutral on the congressional proceedings take pains to distance themselves 
from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the three-month inquiry into 
the matter. ``As reprehensible and disgraceful as Bill Clinton's behavior 
has been, our concentration has to be on doing what's best for Texas, 
and not on that mess going on in D.C.,'' said Robert Black, a spokesman 
for the Republican Party of Texas in Austin. Rep. Robert Livingston, 
the incoming speaker, said Thursday that it is possible that the House 
could vote on impeachment later this month. Livingston has said any 
vote would be a vote of conscience for every member. Similarly, Sen. 
Trent Lott, the majority leader, said Thursday that the Senate was 
waiting on the Judiciary Committee, and was not making preparations 
to receive any possible articles of impeachment from the House. Whatever 
temptation Republican senators may have to intercede, they have kept 
that impulse in check. ``My responsibility is not to come to that 
judgment that fast,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, told reporters 
Thursday. When asked why senior Senate Republicans haven't called 
for an end to the proceedings, Lugar said, ``Sure, people want it 
done. Toast. Over. But that can't, in a rule-of-law situation, be 
the governing principle. We need to proceed deliberately, and not 
just wave it out.'' Indeed, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee 
say not only that they are obliged to pursue the accusations against 
the president, but also that the case against Clinton is overwhelming. 
``The fact of the matter is that we have a mountain of sworn testimony 
that points to the conclusion that the president is guilty of various 
offenses, including lying under oath,'' Rep. Charles Canady, a Florida 
Republican on the committee, said at a hearing on Tuesday about the 
consequences of perjury. Nor are committee members fazed by the notion 
of removing the president for his alleged offenses. ``I don't think 
anybody is irreplaceable,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican. 
``I think Al Gore would make as fine a president as President Clinton.'' 
Cannon, in an interview Thursday, said, ``To have a president who 
ultimately, constantly and thoughtfully lied to us under oath on several 
occasions, you need to deal with that in the most severe terms, and 
that is impeachment.'' Scores of Republicans off the committee lean 
toward impeachment for various reasons. Conservative groups have targeted 
moderate Republicans who have publicly opposed impeachment and supported 
censure as an alternative. Human Events, a national conservative weekly, 
identified 11 Republicans in a recent issue as the ``pro-perjury caucus.'' 
Several of the lawmakers singled out, including Billy Tauzin of Louisiana 
and John Edward Porter of Illinois, have adopted a much lower profile 
since the newspaper article. Clinton is losing support among many 
of these moderate Republicans. ``If they make the case they had substantial 
and credible evidence that perjury or obstruction of justice was committed, 
I would be inclined to vote for impeachment,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, 
a New Jersey Republican. Many undecided Republicans were especially 
angered by what they viewed as Clinton's contemptuous replies to 81 
questions submitted by the Judiciary Committee. ``His wordsmithing 
in response to the questions has raised the deception to new heights,'' 
said Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, a Maryland Republican. ``Two weeks ago, 
I was more impressionable. Quite honestly, now I'm leaning toward 
voting for an article of impeachment dealing with perjury.'' Finally, 
many Republicans on the fence say they feel the influence of DeLay, 
the House Republicans' chief vote-counter. DeLay strongly opposes 
even allowing a vote on a censure, and on Wednesday he mobilized efforts 
to help Republicans informally gauge support for impeachment. ``DeLay 
right now is the prime force,'' said Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican 
who opposes impeachment. ``He's not telling people how to vote,'' 
said King. But then DeLay, the third-ranking House Republican, whose 
nickname is ``The Hammer,'' doesn't have to, King said. ``He's made 
it clear he's for impeachment and he's from the leadership.''
