The top U.S. Republican leaders of the House and Senate pledged Thursday 
to work to preserve Social Security, cut taxes and improve education 
as they sketched the outlines of an agenda for the 106th Congress 
that convenes in January. Tax cuts are ``very, very high on the agenda,'' 
said Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who will become speaker of 
the House in January, the No. 3 position in U.S. politics. Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi added: ``We want to work 
to preserve Social Security, and work to make sure we have a fairer, 
simpler tax code.'' Lott and Livingston, fellow southerners and longtime 
congressional colleagues, appeared jovial and relaxed in what amounted 
to their national television debut as the face of the Republican-controlled 
Congress. In their brief question-and-answer session with reporters, 
the two men were peppered with questions about the pending impeachment 
inquiry against President Bill Clinton. Livingston indicated he hopes 
the House can be called into session later this month to vote on any 
articles of impeachment, if the Judiciary Committee concludes its 
work next week. Lott said he believed a trial would go forward in 
the Senate if any impeachment charges cleared the House. ``I think 
that it would be very hard not to if the House in fact acted. But 
I think to speculate beyond that would be totally inappropriate,'' 
he said. Both men said they had been discussing an agenda for after 
lawmakers convene in January, and offered only the slightest detail. 
They also intend to meet Friday with Republican governors, some of 
whom have made clear they want greater input into the drafting of 
a legislative agenda than they were granted in the past. ``Providing 
more jobs, saving Social Security, making sure that our youngsters 
have good schools to attend, and all of these things are going to 
be right at the forefront of our agenda next year,'' said Livingston, 
whom Republicans have chosen to replace Newt Gingrich as speaker. 
He added that tax cuts will be ``very, very high on the agenda.'' 
In his comments, Lott also cited preserving Social Security and education 
and stressed the need for a fairer tax code. He also made reference 
to fixing the ``unfair marriage penalty,'' which requires come couples 
to pay higher taxes than they would if single. Earlier this week, 
Lott also said he would push for across-the-board cuts in taxes.
