Chilean foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza says he's cautiously 
optimistic that Santiago will win the release from Britain of former 
dictator Augusto Pinochet. Speaking to reporters Wednesday in the 
Chilean capital, Mr. Insulza said he's made several efforts to have 
the retired general repatriated and that much work must still be done. 
The minister made his remarks after returning from trips to Madrid 
and London to press for the general's release. The 83-year-old former 
strongman was arrested in London October 16th on an extradition request 
by Spain which wants to try him for human rights abuses during his 
17-year regime.
