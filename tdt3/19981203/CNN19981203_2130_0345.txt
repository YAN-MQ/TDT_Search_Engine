President Clinton spent the afternoon in Rhode Island promoting new 
regulations for drinking water. At a water treatment facility, he 
announced the federal government is giving states almost $870 million 
to upgrade their water filtration plants. All water treatment facilities 
must be in compliance by 2003. The environmental protection agency 
estimates the changes could prevent as many as 460,000 illnesses. 
The improvements are expected to cost federal, state and local governments 
about $2.5 billion over five years. We have got to get over this idea 
that protecting our environment and the quality of our lives is somehow 
bad for the economy. It will be one of the chief generators of high 
wage jobs in the 21st century, and I hope Rhode Island will lead the 
way. The Clinton administration says for most people, the new regulations 
will add less than $2 to their average monthly water Bill.
