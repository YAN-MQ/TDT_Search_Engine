Regarding elections in Africa, voter registration for next year's 
South African elections has resumed, this time in the country's four 
southern provinces. VOA Johannesburg Correspondent Alex Paleta reports 
from our bureau in Johannesburg. Bad weather, missing staff, and closed 
offices marred the start of the three-day registration process in 
South Africa's four southern provinces. But election commission officials 
said that, while they were concerned about the initial problems, they 
were not alarmed. Similar problems affected last week's voter registration 
effort in the country's five northern provinces, but officials now 
estimate more than 3.7 million South Africans were successfully registered, 
more than initial projections. Because of the difficulties experienced 
so far, authorities have already decided to arrange further registration 
drives early next year in a bid to register an estimated 25 million 
eligible voters nationwide. The registration process has been surrounded 
by controversy because of the requirement that would-be voters have 
a special bar-coded identification document or a certificate that 
they have applied for one. The chairman of South Africa's independent 
electoral commission, Judge Johann Kriegler, has voiced concern that 
as many as five million potential voters might not have the necessary 
documents before the election. Although no date for the vote has been 
set, officials expect it will be held in May. President Nelson Mandela 
has already announced he will not seek reelection. He is expected 
to be succeeded by his current deputy Thabo Mbeki. Alex Paleta, VOA 
News, Johannesburg.
