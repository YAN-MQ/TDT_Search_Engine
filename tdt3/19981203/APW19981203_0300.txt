After nine years as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United, 
Brian Kidd looks set to become manager of his own Premier League club. 
United agreed Thursday to let Kidd talk with last-place Blackburn 
Rovers about filling their managerial vacancy. United want to keep 
Kidd but admit it's now likely he will go. ``He wants to progress 
his career and he wants to have the chance of being a No. 1,'' chief 
executive Martin Edwards said. ``He wants that opportunity to speak 
to them and so reluctantly we have agreed to that. We have accepted 
the fact that he may want to leave.'' Only last week Edwards claimed 
the only way Kidd would leave United would be ``over my dead body.'' 
``We would be very disappointed if he does decide to go because he 
has been a great No. 2 and he would be a big loss to us,'' Edwards 
said. Blackburn has been without a manager since Roy Hodgson was fired 
last month after a 2-0 defeat to Southampton. Rovers' dismal season 
continued Wednesday night with a 1-0 loss to Leicester in the quarterfinals 
of the League Cup. Blackburn, which won the Premier League title in 
1995, is now bottom of the table with only two victories in 15 games. 
Kidd has been associated with Manchester United throughout his career. 
As a 19-year-old, he scored a goal in the club's European Cup victory 
over Benfica in 1968.
