Police clashed with villagers opposed to a major electrical line Thursday 
as workers began laying cables considered essential to meet power 
demands for the 2004 Olympics. One demonstrator was arrested and two 
others slightly injured in the confrontations with police in Kryoneri, 
about 15 kilometers (nine miles) northeast of Athens. State power 
officials repeated warnings last month that the power line is vital 
to safeguard the city's electric grid during the summer Games. Successive 
court battles launched by Kryoneri residents have blocked work on 
one of three major supply lines running from power stations in northern 
Greece to densely populated Athens. Nearly half of Greece's 10.2 million 
live in greater Athens. The unfinished line _ just a few hundred meters 
(yards) from completion _ was blamed for a major blackout in Athens 
during storms in March. ``No one has the right to blackmail 4 million 
people,'' Development Minister Vasso Papandreou told reporters. She 
said the work could be completed within three weeks. Kryoneri residents 
are at odds with the state power company over land expropriation agreements 
and assurances that the high voltage power lines pose no safety risk. 
The government has agreed to place some of the cables underground 
and erect pylons farther away from homes.
