Two former cabinet ministers and a family member of ex-dictator Gen. 
Sani Abacha defrauded Nigeria of about dlrs 2 billion by buying and 
reselling debt payments on a Russian-built steel plant, Nigerian officials 
said. The fraud allegation is just the latest in a string of similar 
accusations linked to Abacha, who was estimated to be worth from dlrs 
3 billion to dlrs 6 billion when he suddenly died in early June. Mohammed 
Haruna, the chief press secretary to head of state Gen. Abdulsalami 
Abubakar, said Tuesday that the Abacha family member and the ministers 
_ none of whom were named _ committed the fraud through debt payments 
owed to Russia for the unfinished Ajaokuta steel plant in northern 
Nigeria. The plant, which is said to have cost a total of about dlrs 
5 billion, was begun in the early 80s and has yet to be finished. 
It has been a regular target of criticism for its waste, mismanagement 
and government corruption. The Abacha family members and the ministers 
set up by an overseas company that purchased about dlrs 2.5 billion 
in debt owed to Russia by Nigeria at a heavy discount _ paying about 
dlrs 500 million. The company, which has not been identified, then 
resold the debt to Nigeria at its face value, pocketing the remaining 
dlrs 2 billion, Haruna said. Pickup 6th graf pvs.
