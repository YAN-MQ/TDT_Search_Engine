In a show of defiance, the Yugoslav parliament Thursday denounced 
America's ``destructive'' policies in the Balkans and declared support 
for President Slobodan Milosevic. A declaration, approved by the assembly, 
accused the United States of ``directly supporting separatism and 
terrorism and financing the adversaries'' of Yugoslavia, according 
to a text distributed by the state-run Tanjug news agency. The strongly-worded 
declaration followed intensified U.S. diplomatic efforts over Kosovo 
and a reported change of American policies toward Milosevic. Washington 
has always blamed Milosevic for instigating ethnic conflict in the 
Balkans and imposed diplomatic and economic sanctions against his 
government. Nevertheless, the Clinton administration has been working 
closely with Milosevic since 1995 in efforts to ensure a lasting peace 
in Bosnia, formerly a Yugoslav republic. This week, however, State 
Department spokesman James Rubin claimed Milosevic's grip on power 
was weakening. Some media reports suggested the Clinton Administration 
was prepared to support Milosevic's opponents inside Yugoslavia with 
an aim to topple the Balkan leader. The parliamentary declaration 
noted that ``in the past several days there have been several gross 
attacks by representatives of American administration against Yugoslavia, 
its vital state and national interests ...'' ``Election will of the 
people is the sovereign will ... Constitutional bodies of Serbia and 
Yugoslavia cannot be replaced according to the will of a foreign factor 
...'' it added. The declaration further said American pressure ``presents 
support for separatism and terrorism in Kosovo, causing destabilization 
of the region.'' It added that the United States were aiding ethnic 
Albanian separatists in their aim to secede Kosovo from Serbia and 
Yugoslavia, which also includes Montenegro. ``The parliament fully 
supports Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in his efforts to defend 
vital national and state interests ...'' added the declaration calling 
U.S. policies in the Balkans ``destructive'' and against international 
standards. Apparently counting on traditional Serb mistrust toward 
Western politicians, the parliament further said that American pressure 
on Milosevic only served as a ``recognition'' that his policies were 
in the interest of the country. Reformist deputies from Montenegro, 
who enjoy U.S. support, did not attend the session as well as some 
opposition deputies from Serbia. The republics of Montenegro and Serbia 
form what is left of Yugoslavia.
