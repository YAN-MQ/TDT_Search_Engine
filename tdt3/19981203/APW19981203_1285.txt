Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said on Thursday that the French economy 
would grow 2.7 percent in 1999, a day after his Finance Minister said 
the country couldn't meet that target. Jospin told the French parliament 
that growth would be achieved if consumption were to hold up and if 
there was a pickup in investment as a result of consumer spending. 
On Wednesday, Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said France 
could not meet the 2.7 percent growth target because of the international 
financial crisis. Jospin's comments came as 11 European central bank 
in their first coordinated move ahead of the introduction of Europe's 
new single currency cut interest rates to 3.0 percent, except Italy, 
which cut its rate to 3.5 percent. Following the announcement of the 
rate cut, Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet would not comment 
on his expectations for 1999 French growth, saying the international 
environment remains uncertain.
