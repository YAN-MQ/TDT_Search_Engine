We're going to take "A closer look" tonight at what you listen to. 
You don't have to listen closely to know that there are more sources 
of noise out there than ever before. More people, more cars, more 
planes, not to mention more things such as leaf blowers. Now researchers 
are beginning to learn that even low levels of noise over long periods 
of time can pose serious health risks. Here's ABC's Ned Potter. It's 
enough to make you scream -- the planes overhead, the traffic below, 
the jackhammers, the blaring radios. You get the idea. Noise is a 
very stressful thing, and it makes people jittery, mean, cruel and 
vicious. After enough of that, you think you're losing your mind, 
right? Well, researchers aren't sure but increasingly they believe 
a noisy world does affect the brain. Noise is a source of stress, 
both, because, I think, it's annoying, but also because it's difficult 
or impossible to control it. Gary Evans of Cornell University studied 
school children near a New airport in Germany. After the airport opened, 
the kids had -- higher blood pressure, higher levels of certain stress 
hormones and lower reading scores. Why would reading suffer? Evans 
believes that when school children face a constant barrage of sound, 
their brains begin to overcompensate. They tune out not only the noise, 
but they become indiscriminate and they tune out speech. And the problem 
is that speech perception, language acquisition, are critical building 
blocks of learning how to read. What to do? The airline industry has 
been forced to use quieter jets. But people who study noise say it 
makes no difference, because, by one count, air traffic has gone up 
500% since 1960. Roads ought to be quieter, too, with highway noise 
barriers and so forth. But highway traffic has doubled in the last 
20 years. Government is not doing much, so it falls to a few activists 
to sound the alarm. Noise is not just an annoyance. It's a psychological 
and mental health hazard. Researchers say they are not so worried 
about damage to your ears, it's the rest of the body, worn down over 
time, because we cannot turn down the volume. Ned Potter, ABC News,
