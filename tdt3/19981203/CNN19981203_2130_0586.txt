Robots are taking over for humans in all kinds of dangerous jobs. 
And these days, it's not just in simple, repetitive tasks. In this 
edition of "tech trends," Rick Lockridge looks at a complex system 
designed to make construction safer. a construction site can be a 
dangerous place to work. One reason -- heavy equipment, from backhoes 
to cranes, working in close quarters with people. Heavy loads dangle 
from cables. Often the equipment operator can't actually see what 
he's doing and has to rely on hand signals or guidance sent by walkie-talkie. 
Researchers at the U.S. commerce department hope to reduce the danger 
by developing remote-controlled cranes that don't rely on the physical 
presence of an operator. This is a Crane that allows you to manipulate 
objects and control them very precisely, more so than you could with 
any existing type of Crane. The robotic Crane currently being tested 
uses sensors, video cameras and the global positioning system to see 
where it's going and what it's doing. We are sensing the location, 
the position and the orientation of the machine in real time. That 
information is wirelessly transferred off the machine to a receiver 
at the construction site shack. It then goes from there down the Internet 
to a receiving station. So the operator doesn't have to be sitting 
in the Crane's cab or even in the same city. The experimental Crane 
controls its load in eight different directions, unlike conventional 
cranes, which only maneuver in three directions. That makes it easier 
to keep the load from swinging out of control and reduces the need 
for workers to guide it by hand. And a job can be mapped out in advance. 
It allows us to simulate, ahead of time, planning without actually 
moving the object on site. Once we have simulated the maneuver, we 
can actually download the path and the job that's being done by the 
particular machine to the machine on the construction site and say 
"go." The first big test for the new Crane will be automatic deployment 
of welding robots for Navy shipbuilding. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
