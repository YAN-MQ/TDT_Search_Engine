The government announced a date for national elections today, but 
any hope that this would be received positively by student protesters 
was short lived. The government set June 7 for elections for a new 
House of Representatives. It also said that on Aug. 29, four months 
earlier than previously scheduled, it would convene the highest legislative 
body, the People's Consultative Assembly, to elect a new president. 
But students who have been pressing President B.J. Habibie for swifter 
democratic reforms continued their protests and blocked Jakarta's 
main thoroughfare Thursday afternoon, demanding the arrest of Suharto, 
the former President, on corruption charges. Students have held protests 
throughout the capital almost daily since a clash with soldiers and 
the police in central Jakarta mid-November left 16 dead and scores 
injured. In addition to Suharto's arrest, student demands include 
returning the army to its barracks and an end to its role in political 
and economic affairs.
