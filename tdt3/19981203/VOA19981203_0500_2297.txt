Here in Washington, President Clinton and Pakistani Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif had held crucial talks on reducing the threat of nuclear 
war in South Asia. As Mr. Sharif left the White House, he said talks 
focused on Pakistan's dispute with India over the Kashmir region and 
on U.S. concerns over India and Pakistani nuclear arms tests. Mr. 
Sharif said he hopes India will not detonate more nuclear devices. 
To do so, he said, would make the situation much worse. Pakistan and 
India are holding talks to ease tensions, but Mr. Sharif is pressing 
for third party mediation.
