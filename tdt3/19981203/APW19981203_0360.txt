A computer entrepreneur charged with subversion for giving away Chinese 
e-mail addresses to an Internet democracy magazine is to go on trial 
Friday in a courtroom closed to the public and reporters. Lin Hai, 
30, is accused of ``inciting the overthrow of state power'' by giving 
30,000 addresses to ``Big Reference,'' a pro-democracy journal published 
by dissidents abroad. His case highlights China's efforts to police 
the Internet with the same intensity it has used to try to silence 
other forms of political dissent. Two lawyers are to appear with Lin 
in court, but his wife, reporters and other spectators are barred. 
Most trials in Shanghai are open, but that policy makes an exception 
for privacy cases and government secrets. ``Because this case involves 
government internal affairs, it is not public,'' said Li Chunping, 
a spokesman for the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office. Lin's wife, Xu 
Hong, said she would wait outside the courthouse. She had appealed 
unsuccessfully for an open trial. Lin, owner of a Shanghai computer 
software company, was detained in March and charged the next month. 
His trial had been scheduled to start last week but was postponed 
without explanation. Xu said she has written to President Jiang Zemin 
and Premier Zhu Rongji asking for their help but has received no reply.
