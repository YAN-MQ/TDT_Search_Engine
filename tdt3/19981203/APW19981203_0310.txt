Fiorentina beats Internazionale, but is battered by traditional patsy 
Piacenza. AS Roma handles Juventus and Fiorentina, but loses to struggling 
Sampdoria. Juventus goes four games without a victory _ including 
three without a single goal _ but stays right in the thick of the 
Italian League's tight title chase. Parity has arrived in Serie A. 
Seven clubs are bunched within five points of the top of the standings, 
currently led by Fiorentina, enjoying its first run alone in first 
place since way back in 1982. With the season a third of the way done, 
Fiorentina (7-1-3) has 22 points, three ahead of Roma and AC Parma. 
Juve and AC Milan are next with 18, while Inter and Bologna have 17. 
Things could start to shift Saturday, when Fiorentina has a tough 
test against visiting Bologna, Roma hosts Japanese star Hidetoshi 
Nakata's Perugia, and Parma travels to Sampdoria at night. The games 
were pushed ahead of the rest of the schedule because Bologna, Roma 
and Parma play UEFA Cup games Tuesday. In Sunday's action, Inter and 
new coach Mircea Lucescu are at Vicenza, Juve hosts disappointing 
Lazio of Rome, Milan hosts Udinese, Piacenza is home to Empoli, Bari 
is at Salernitana, and Cagliari hosts Venezia. ``The tight standings 
are exciting and give at least seven or eight clubs hopes of winning 
the title,'' said Dino Zoff, Italy's national team coach. ``While 
Fiorentina is among (the contenders) I don't consider it a heavy favorite.'' 
Veteran coach Giovanni Trapattoni's club did look more like a pretender 
than a contender in two of its last three outings: the 4-2 loss to 
Piacenza and a scoreless draw with Bari. Fiorentina did put it all 
together in between those two games, though, in a 3-1 win over Inter. 
No one has shined consistently so far and the reasons are varied. 
One equalizer is the slew of injuries to key players (chiefly Juve's 
Alessandro Del Piero and Lazio's Christian Vieri). Another is what's 
called the ``World Cup factor,'' whereby the big teams that stock 
their rosters with internationals have seen those players tire after 
a short offseason because of France '98. ``It is a balanced, but not 
mediocre, league,'' Trapattoni said. ``Every Sunday can produce exciting 
games like ours against Inter last week or the Rome derby. And many 
of the small clubs have improved a lot, which makes everything tougher. 
For example, Bari and Piacenza are the true surprises. They play great 
soccer and make things hard on any team.'' Against Bologna, which 
has a league-high nine-game undefeated streak, Trapattoni must find 
a way for his shaky defense to slow the suddenly rejuvenated Giuseppe 
Signori. In the last year, both Lazio and Sampdoria gave up on the 
former league scoring leader. But Signori, 30, has a club-high five 
goals and heads a versatile attack that includes Russia's Igor Kolyvanov, 
Sweden's Kennet Andersson, and Brazil's Eriberto. Signori had a goal 
and an assist in the first seven minutes last week as Bologna went 
on to beat Juventus 3-0. The game also presents an intriguing matchup 
between Fiorentina's high-octane attack (league-best 22 goals, led 
by Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta's 11) and Bologna's stingy 
defense (nine goals allowed _ only Parma has given up fewer).
