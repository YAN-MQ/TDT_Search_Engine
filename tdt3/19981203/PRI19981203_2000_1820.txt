For The World, this is Alan Dow in the BBC newsroom in London. The 
House of Representative's Judiciary Committee has decided not to follow-up 
and inquiry into alleged fundraising irregularities in President Clinton's 
re-election campaign. The fundraising allegations were added to the 
inquiry on Tuesday. And investigators examining documents in the case 
have concluded there's nothing to follow-up. Paul Reynolds reports. 
The expectation now is that the committee will vote on Articles of 
Impeachment at the end of next week. The main and possibly the only 
charge would be perjury. The full House of Representatives would then 
hold its vote probably in the following week. Most observers here 
now think that the committee will vote along party lines to impeach 
Mr. Clinton, but that the votes still aren't there in the House, despite 
its Republican majority. So, there is renewed talk of a motion of 
censure instead as many members of Congress don't want the President 
to get off scot-free. Paul Reynolds reporting.
