I'm David Chadwick, VOA News. Today's scheduled launch of the Space 
Shuttle Endeavour with the component of the International Space Station 
on board has been canceled. The launch was called off seconds before 
lift off because engineers could not find the cause of an equipment 
alarm. Problems during the countdown delayed the launch past a narrow 
window. The shuttle wants to rendezvous with a Russian-made module 
of the space station already in orbit. U.S. space agency officials 
say another launch attempt will not be made for at least 24 hours.
