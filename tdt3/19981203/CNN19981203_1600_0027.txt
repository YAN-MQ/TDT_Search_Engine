House Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde says the impeachment 
inquiry against President Clinton will not delve into allegations 
of campaign finance abuses. Three republican members of the committee 
tell CNN, Hyde announced the decision during a conference call. Hyde 
told them republican counsel failed to find anything new that would 
fall under the impeachment inquiry in memos from the FBI director 
as well as others. Meanwhile, a group of moderate congressional republicans 
has begun circulating a proposed censure resolution as an alternative 
to impeachment. Some democrats have also been urging censure. Earlier 
today house speaker nominee Bob Livingston said the impeachment inquiry 
will go into 1999 if the committee doesn't finish its work next week. 
If, in fact, they report this year -- and that's not certain yet -- 
and if they were to recommend a vote on articles of impeachment, it'll 
be the most significant, most important vote, most weighty vote of 
a member of congress' career. White House officials have made it clear 
they are open to some sort of penalty short of impeachment. The president's 
lawyers will begin presenting his defense in the inquiry next week.
