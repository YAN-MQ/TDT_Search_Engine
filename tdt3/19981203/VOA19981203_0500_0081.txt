Israel and the Palestinians are exchanging accusations as to who is 
responsible for the latest crisis in the peace process. Israel says 
it will not withdraw from anymore West Bank land until the Palestinian 
authority meets several conditions. VOA's David Gullis reports from 
Jerusalem. The crisis in the peace process has been brewing for several 
days but it came to a head Wednesday when a crowd of Palestinians 
attacked an Israeli car and beat its driver in the West Bank in an 
incident that was filmed by a video crew and shown on Israeli television. 
The Israeli government announced only hours later that it was halting 
West Bank withdrawals until the Palestinians stopped anti-Israeli 
incitement and talk of unilaterally declaring a stay. Israeli spokesman, 
Mosha Fugal. We're talking about peace, and an Israeli cannot take 
his vehicle and travel to a Palestinian town without being lynched. 
Palestinian leaders meanwhile accuse their Israeli counterparts of 
looking for pretext not to fulfill their part of the Wye agreement 
and of fomenting a crisis ahead of President Clinton's visit here 
later this month. David Gullis, VOA News, Jerusalem.
