A man tried to warm the frozen heating pipes in his apartment complex 
with a fire, but the blaze quickly spread out of control and gutted 
the building, leaving 40 people homeless, a news report said Thursday. 
The unidentified man built the fire in the basement of a two-story 
wooden building in the Maldyak township in Russia's Far East, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. But several rags caught fire and spread 
the blaze throughout the building. All the residents managed to escape 
unharmed, the report said.
