Firefighters managed Thursday to put out a fire that had raged at 
a Coca-Cola bottling plant for nearly 30 hours. The blaze caused no 
injuries but considerable damage to one of the country's major foreign 
investments. Officials are expected to issue a damage report Friday, 
including an estimate of the cost of the blaze. Workers said the fire 
started early Wednesday after plastic boxes placed near a huge lamp 
melted and then ignited. The four-year-old plant is a joint venture 
between Atlanta-based Coca-Cola and Italy's Gruppo Busi, which also 
operates bottling plants in Italy. The Albanian plant produces about 
100 million bottles annually in a country of fewer than 3 million 
people.
