A University of California study concludes charter schools don't live 
up to claims. The report is one of the first to look at the Lang-term 
performance of charter schools. According to the study, the schools 
have too much control over who attends, rely too much on private money 
and have no way to measure if stunts are doing better. Nearly 1100 
clarter schools have opened in 26 states.
