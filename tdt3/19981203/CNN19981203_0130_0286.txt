The White House is dismissing new conditions Israel has attached to 
a troop pullback from the West Bank. Wednesday, Israel threatened 
to suspend the troop pullback, unless palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 
stops promising to declare a Palestinian state in may. Israel says 
its decision also was prompted, in part, by an attack on an israeli 
soldier in the West Bank town of Ramallah. The soldier was dragged 
from his car, stoned and beaten by a Palestinian mob. Some of the 
Palestinians yelled to let him go. The soldier eventually got up and 
ran to safety.
