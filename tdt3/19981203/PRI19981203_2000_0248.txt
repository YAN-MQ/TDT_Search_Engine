Britain's Opposition Conservative Party is facing more problems. Four 
of its senior figures in the Upper House of Parliament, The House 
of Lords, have resigned. They left the party because their chief William 
Heg fired their leader in the upper house, Lord Cranborn. But, Mr. 
Heg said he had to act after Lord Cranborn reached an unauthorized 
deal with the Prime Minister Tony Blair. Called the next ordinary 
position yesterday, but I had to deal with that and I had dealt with 
that. And I want everybody in the conservative party to know that 
I will deal with similar situations in the future in the same manner. 
I am going to rebuild the party on the basis of discipline and cohesion. 
And I will not allow the party to bounce into things by force. Britain's 
Opposition Leader William Heg.
