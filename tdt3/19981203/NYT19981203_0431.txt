Any day now, the killer waves will come raging out of the gurgling 
surf off Pillar Point. There is nothing to do but wait for them. The 
men waiting _ at this point, they are all men _ belong to a small, 
exclusive club of surfers from all over the world, though a good many 
live nearby, some having moved from places where there are no waves 
as big as four-story buildings or as hard as granite. ``There is no 
place like this on earth,'' said Grant Washburn, after four hours 
in the rain watching waves whipped by the wind. Washburn, a rangy 
30-year-old film grip from Connecticut, lives in San Francisco, 25 
miles north of here. But these days, he spends most of his time at 
Maverick's, the spot off Pillar Point where the waves rise to 20, 
30, 40 feet or more during the rainy season. For his four hours of 
watching the waters Wednesday, he found one clean wave he could ride. 
``A 15-footer. Not that big, but a good one,'' he said, changing from 
his wet suit in the mud parking lot about a mile from Pillar Point. 
Surfers anticipate Maverick's waves all year not because they are 
the biggest anywhere. The North Shore of Oahu and Todos Santos, off 
Ensenada, Mexico, claim swells just as big. But the swells here are 
different. Shaped by the sea bottom, which rises here from a depth 
of more than 100 feet to only a few feet, Maverick's waves are thicker, 
surlier and more unpredictable than anywhere else. They will allow 
a surfer to ride their backs for a good long minute, or throw them 
off in two seconds. One of the best surfers in the world, Mark Foo, 
died trying out Maverick's five years ago, cementing its claim as 
the hardest place to surf on the planet. This year, Washburn and 19 
other Maverick's surfers _ about a fifth of the world's total _ have 
a new reason to wait for the waves. Quicksilver, a clothing company, 
is sponsoring the first ``Mavericks Men Who Ride Mountains'' contest. 
The one-day competition, with a $10,000 first prize for the best performance, 
is by invitation only. Contestants started waiting for 24-hour notice 
for the contest Nov. 1 and will continue to wait until Jan. 27, the 
period during which the perfect 20-foot wave is supposed to rear its 
enormous head. Two surfers from Hawaii and two from Australia who 
are waiting in Hawaii will fly in at a moment's notice. Most of the 
rest of the competitors are already hanging around. ``The waves come 
in pulses,'' Washburn said. ``Today was one of the days when you had 
to know what you're doing. I let 50 waves pass. Thanksgiving was amazing. 
I gave up Thanksgiving dinner to be here. I'd give up most anything.'' 
His is a typical Maverick's surfer's attitude. These surfers are probably 
more driven and more solitary than their small-wave counterparts. 
They rise at the crack of dawn to spend the entire day wet and cold, 
with no one to witness their glory. Nothing about the place they cherish 
looks remotely inviting. There is really no beach at Pillar Point, 
just rocks and cliffs. To get to the waves requires a 15-minute hike 
up a slippery slope. Then, it's a 25-minute paddle to Maverick's. 
The water is 49 degrees, or colder. The star of Maverick's (which 
is named for a surfer's dog) is Jeff Clark, a 41-year-old local who 
runs a surf shop and carves custom surfboards. He started riding Maverick's 
when he was 17. For 15 years, he had the spot to himself. Then, other 
surfers started trickling here. This year, Clark is Quicksilver's 
contest director. He judges the ocean condition and will decide the 
day of the show. As such, he has opted out of the competition. ``I've 
got just a little more daylight _ I've got to see what's out there,'' 
he said the other day to a caller to his shop. ``When the waves are 
there, I have to drop everything.'' Clark has taken some heat for 
endorsing a contest, a move some surfers say will spoil Maverick's 
exclusivity. But the harshness of the spot naturally weeds out all 
but the few surfers who have learned to finesse giant waves. Clark 
said he hand-picked the contestants to assure that only veterans of 
big wave surfing who know Maverick's could participate. Most are in 
their 30s; the oldest is 45. The bigger worry here is that crowds 
will flock to watch the surfers. But it takes a fine day or a hardy 
soul to do that, too. The surfers are simply too far offshore to really 
see _ the contest will be judged on a boat _ and it is too long a 
hike to try when it rains. This afternoon, even Clark was not in the 
mood. The wind was whipping the Pacific into a froth, and the sky 
was a Russian winter gray. ``It's really freezing out,'' he said as 
he plodded in his wet suit to the cove where the surfers paddle out. 
``What we're looking for for the contest is a sunny, bright day with 
little wind.'' Still, when he saw the 12-foot waves in the distance, 
he could not promise he would not be out later, just because it's 
so much fun to be out among the giant swells.
