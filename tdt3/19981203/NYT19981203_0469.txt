If the mail is any guide, Charles Dickens was surely writing from 
life when he created Ebenezer Scrooge, who threatened Bob Cratchit 
with the loss of his livelihood on Christmas Eve. There seems to be 
something about the season that brings out the beast in many a manager. 
Scrooge was the first person to come to A.J. Lawrence's mind when 
she recalled a holiday season at a Park Avenue law firm. ``Fresh out 
of law school, I was very excited about my first office holiday party,'' 
she wrote from Manhattan. ``Visions of sugar plums danced in my head, 
as well as thoughts of an open bar and lavish buffet. Anything could 
happen.'' On the day of the party, the partners called members of 
the staff together for a meeting. ``I assumed the partners wished 
to praise each and every one of us for a year's worth of good work,'' 
Ms. Lawrence wrote. Instead, she said, the 20 lawyers, 2 paralegals, 
10 secretaries and various support staff were chastised by the managing 
partner for failing to give thanks to each and every partner for their 
raises. (Ms. Lawrence uses the word ``minuscule'' to describe them.) 
Next, she said, the managing partner berated them for not providing 
the partners with gifts. In closing, he informed his audience that 
many of them would not be employed by the firm during the coming year. 
He then wished one and all a ``Merry Christmas'' and a ``Happy Hanukkah.'' 
And the party had not yet begun. The site was a little Italian restaurant 
a few blocks from the office. When the managing partner saw it, he 
threw a tantrum. ``This place is a dump!'' Ms. Lawrence recalled him 
screaming. At the end of the considerably muted festivities, he dismissed 
the staff member who had chosen the restaurant. The next year, Ms. 
Lawrence quit her job just before the holiday party. The managing 
partner said she could attend anyway. She declined. When Lorraine 
LaFemina was starting out as a writer, she landed a job at a small 
publishing company where the hours were long, the pay was scant and 
the employees had to punch in and out on time cards. But one day, 
to their surprise, the employees were told that a holiday party had 
been scheduled from 1 p.m. until quitting time. ``As the hour approached, 
we anxiously watched as catered food was brought in from a tony delicatessen: 
champagne, fancy cutlery, dim sum, the works,'' Ms. LaFemina wrote. 
At last, the staff began to feel appreciated _ until a loudspeaker 
announcement ordered one and all to punch out at 1 p.m. before attending 
the celebration. When Ms. LaFemina complained to her supervisor about 
being docked a half-day's pay to attend an office party, she received 
a quick reply: ``Well, how do you think we're going to pay for all 
this?'' Ms. LaFemina now owns a small publishing company in Eastport, 
N.Y. ``I give my writers a nice cash bonus at holiday time,'' she 
said. A few years ago, when Christine Bliss, now of Shelton, Conn., 
was working as a payroll manager for a trucking company in New Jersey, 
the owners had a holiday tradition: a potluck buffet luncheon. ``Each 
person brought his or her special dish, the company contributed a 
six-foot hero sandwich and we ate happily, laughing and chatting about 
the upcoming holidays,'' Ms. Bliss wrote. ``Spirits were high.'' Then 
she received a summons to the office of the chief financial officer. 
Ms. Bliss said he told her that the company was going to downsize 
its office staff immediately and handed her a list of 20 names. Her 
instructions were to bring the victims, one by one, into his office, 
where they would be handed their final paychecks (no severance), dismissed 
and escorted to the front door with no chance to say goodbye to co-workers. 
Ms. Bliss set about her work. ``At first no one noticed that people 
were gradually disappearing,'' she said. ``For about 20 minutes, the 
party remained in full swing, but all of a sudden, it seemed to dawn 
on everyone that people were vanishing. The word of what was happening 
went around fast, and voices gradually died away until the room was 
silent. ``They terminated more than one-third of the office staff 
that day, and I finished the afternoon crying at my desk.'' As the 
senior labor negotiator for a former employer, Ronald Rakowski of 
Bethel, Conn., became known one year as ``the Scrooge from corporate'' 
for pressing a contract provision that eliminated all holidays, including 
Christmas, at one of its larger plants. The production shutdown, management 
had decided, was just too costly. ``Even my normally supportive and 
long-suffering family sided with the workers,'' he wrote, with his 
wife and children muttering ``something about my next Christmas stocking 
and coal.'' ``Then one day, during a company bargaining committee 
caucus, we were distracted from our deliberations by loud chanting 
coming from the parking lot. We peered out the windows and were greeted 
by a parking lot full of children, ranging from toddlers to teen-agers, 
holding placards which read: `Please let Mom and Dad spend Christmas 
with us!' ``Fearful of a visit from Charles Dickens' Ghost of Christmas 
Yet to Come, we did.''
