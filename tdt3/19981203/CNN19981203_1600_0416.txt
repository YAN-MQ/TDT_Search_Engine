In Germany, U.S. rapper Coolio has been found guilty of being an accessory 
to robbery and causing bodily injury. A boutique owner says the music 
star took clothing from the store without paying last year, and punched 
her when she tried to stop him. Coolio says he was promised free clothing 
in exchange for signing autographs in the store. A court in Stuttgart 
sentenced him to six months probation and fined him 30,000 marks, 
the equivalent of 17,000 U.S. dollars.
