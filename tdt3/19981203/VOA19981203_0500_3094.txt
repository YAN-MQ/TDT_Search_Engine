According to this unscientific study involving men and women shopping 
for holiday gifts, it seems that men are the ones who experience the 
most stress. Psychologist David Lewis conducted a survey of three 
dozen male shoppers for a north London shopping center to see how 
they reacted to all the hustle and bustle of holiday time. Indeed 
in some cases, we were finding levels of stress that you might perhaps 
find in a combat pilot flying into action or even a riot police officer 
dealing with an angry mob. So they did become for a short time very, 
very stressed out by the shopping experience. The men in the survey 
complained most about the noise and the crowds and the delays at the 
checkout counter. The women say the best way to deal with their own 
shopping stress is simply leave the men and children at home. Well, 
there's a shopping mall in the south of England that opened a creche 
for men. It's a father and son creche where the fathers can go and 
read magazines and play computer games or watch television while the 
woman does the shopping. Women in the survey say the best way to deal 
with their own shopping stress is to go it alone.
