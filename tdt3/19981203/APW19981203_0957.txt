Cleopa, the charismatic Romanian monk persecuted by communists and 
admired by pilgrims, has died in his secluded wilderness monastery, 
a church official announced Thursday. He was 87. Cleopa, who hid in 
forests from communists and was known for comforting words for common 
people, succumbed to age-related illnesses Wednesday in the Sihastria 
monastery deep in the forest of northern Romania, said the Romanian 
Orthodox Church in Iasi. Hounded by the Securitate communist secret 
police, who feared his popular appeal, Cleopa fled to the forest in 
1953 and built an underground den, where he lived in hiding for almost 
a decade. Every month, a woodcutter brought him a sack of potatoes. 
Cleopa said he ate one potato a day _ all he needed to survive. In 
an interview with the Associated Press in October, Cleopa talked about 
his 60 years of work as a spiritual father or ``duhovnic'' in the 
Romanian Orthodox Church. ``The spiritual father is the soul of the 
monastery and of the village. He should be the light of the world 
by his life and sermons,'' he said. Born into a family of peasants 
in a village in northern Romania, Cleopa became a monk at 25. After 
he entered the monastery he worked as a shepherd for 12 years. He 
was best known for his understanding of ordinary peoples' problems 
and his healing words. Tens of thousands sought his advice, both under 
communism and in the years of hardship that followed the toppling 
of communist rule in 1989. ``He knew the needs and soul of the Romanian 
people,'' said Dan Ciachir, a Christian Orthodox expert. ``He didn't 
have a very elevated language, but he knew how to comfort people.'' 
Cleopa will be buried Saturday at the Sihastria monastery, 200 miles 
north of Bucharest, where he had lived for 30 years. Thousands are 
expected to attend the funeral. Romanian Orthodox monks are buried 
sitting in a chair, which is lowered directly into the ground.
