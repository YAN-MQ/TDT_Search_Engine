A Polish shipbuilding consortium on Thursday became the new owner 
of the historic Gdansk Shipyard, where the Solidarity movement was 
born in 1980. The shipyard, now bankrupt, was controlled by a government-appointed 
receiver who signed the final documents shortly after midnight to 
allow the consortium to take it over, said Maciej Paluszynski, a spokesman 
for the receiver. The consortium has until Monday to pay 115 million 
zloty (dlrs 33 million) for the state-owned shipyard, which has debts 
of at least 628 million zloty (dlrs 180 million). Under the agreement, 
the new owners will maintain Gdansk Shipyard as a separate company 
and pledged to spend up to dlrs 100 million in the next 12 years to 
modernize the shipyard and create 1,000 more jobs. The shipyard currently 
employs 2,500 people, Paluszynski said. At the height of anti-communist 
strikes in August 1980, shipyard electrician Lech Walesa launched 
Solidarity, the former East Bloc's first independent trade union. 
It became a pro-democracy movement that led Poles to topple the totalitarian 
regime in 1989, and Walesa became the first post-communist president. 
On Aug. 8, 1996, the government declared the indebted shipyard bankrupt 
after banks refused to grant further credits.
