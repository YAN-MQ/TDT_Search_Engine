The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 4: More than 
40 years after Dr. Sam Sheppard was convicted of murdering his wife, 
the Ohio Supreme Court has allowed his son, Sam Reese Sheppard, the 
chance to clear the doctor's name. Yet even now the local county prosecutor 
is stubbornly fighting efforts to exonerate Sheppard, whose plight 
inspired the movie and television series ``The Fugitive.'' The case 
still captures the public imagination because it shows the evil of 
a legal system when it is blind to innocence. The court's decision 
allows Sheppard's son to move forward with a wrongful-imprisonment 
lawsuit against the state of Ohio. Sheppard served 10 years in prison 
before the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction on 
grounds that the trial had been tainted by excessive press coverage. 
He was acquitted at a second trial in 1966, but died a few years later 
a broken alcoholic. New DNA evidence shows that blood spattered at 
the Sheppard house does not match that of either Sheppard or his wife, 
indicating that a third person was present at the scene. DNA evidence 
also suggests that the killer may have been a window washer who was 
eventually convicted of another murder. Rarely do prosecutors admit 
that devastating mistakes were made even in cases decades old. The 
Sheppard case still polarizes lawyers and politicians who feel compelled 
to defend their actions in the earlier investigation. One Ohio Supreme 
Court justice who had been an assistant prosecutor in the second trial 
refused to recuse himself despite his obvious conflict of interest. 
He voted, unsuccessfully, to block the wrongful-imprisonment lawsuit. 
But Sheppard arguably got a better shake than many innocent people 
who have been wrongly convicted. His wealth and professional standing 
brought attention to the case, and the noted criminal lawyer F. Lee 
Bailey helped win his acquittal. Sheppard was railroaded into prison 
for 10 years. Less privileged individuals without resources or able 
champions have languished even longer in prison, sometimes on death 
row, for crimes they did not commit.
