Imagine Summers where the sun never sets and winters with continual 
darkness. Currently, those conditions exist only in the northern and 
southern polar regions of earth. But scientists at Penn state University 
say it may have been very different 600 million years ago. They theorize 
the earth's axis was tilted at a 55-degree angle to the sun, much 
more severe than the current 23.5 degrees. That would have made the 
tropics cold enough for glaciers to form. The researchers theorize 
a buildup and melting of the glaciers may have caused earth's axis 
to shift to its current position.
