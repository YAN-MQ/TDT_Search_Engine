Israeli Cabinet ministers assembled around a TV set and watched a 
video of a Palestinian mob ambushing an Israeli soldier. When the 
tape stopped, the decision was unanimous: Israel would suspend its 
West Bank troop withdrawal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 
Thursday that the attack near the West Bank city of Ramallah, in which 
the trapped soldier was pulled out of a car and repeatedly struck 
in the head with rocks, was a direct result of incitement by the Palestinian 
Authority against Israel. ``I cannot allow myself to see Israeli citizens 
being lynched, or about to be lynched by a crazed mob that received 
incitement from Palestinian officials,'' Netanyahu said in explaining 
his decision to hold up the land-for-security agreement. Netanyahu 
said he would only resume implementation of the agreement once Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat publicly dropped plans to announce a state in 
May and accepted Israel's criteria for the release of Palestinian 
prisoners. Israel has said it will not free those involved in attacks 
that resulted in death or injury. The Palestinians demand that Israel 
free prisoners held for anti-Israeli activities. The Palestinians 
appealed to the United States for help and Arafat said Thursday that 
Netanyahu is ``violating completely'' the Wye agreement. U.S. State 
Department spokesman James Rubin sided with the Palestinians, saying 
the Wye River peace agreement ``should be implemented as signed.'' 
The crisis hit just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was 
to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase of the peace accord. 
David Leavy, a White House spokesman said the Clinton trip was still 
on. In mid-December, five percent of the West Bank is to be transferred 
from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction and Israel is to release 
250 more Palestinian prisoners. In Israel, meanwhile, the new confrontation 
with the Palestinians has helped stabilize Netanyahu's shaky coalition. 
In response to the Cabinet's decision to suspend implementation of 
the Wye agreement, hard-line coalition legislators said they would 
not support an early elections bill as initially planned. The legislation 
was to have come before parliament Monday, but its sponsors said they 
might delay the vote because they no longer have a majority. The latest 
cycle of violence began Wednesday morning when an Arab street cleaner 
was stabbed to death, apparently by a Jewish extremist, in a mixed 
Arab-Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem. In response, dozens of masked 
Palestinians blocked Jerusalem roads with burning tires and threw 
stones at cars. Israeli police fired rubber bullets. Early Thursday, 
a shack in Tel Aviv housing five Palestinian laborers from the Gaza 
Strip was set on fire, and police said they were investigating whether 
the arsonists had political motives. The laborers escaped unharmed. 
After the attack on the Israeli soldier on Wednesday, Netanyahu convened 
his so-called security Cabinet and played a videotape of the incident. 
Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi said the atmosphere in the Cabinet 
room was tense during the screening and that those present decided 
unanimously afterward to hold up implementation of the accord. However, 
the Palestinian Authority blamed Israel for the latest crisis, saying 
it had raised tensions by refusing to release Palestinian prisoners 
jailed for anti-Israeli activities. The two sides also argued over 
whether the attack on the soldier was orchestrated or spontaneous. 
The incident began when about 150 Palestinian university students, 
many supporters of Arafat's Fatah faction, staged a march in Ramallah 
to press for prisoner releases. The group then marched to the outskirts 
of town to throw stones at Israeli cars, including the one the soldier 
was riding in. Netanyahu said the incident was ``organized, orchestrated, 
planned in advance and fomented by the Palestinian Authority.'' However, 
Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader in the West Bank, said the incident 
was triggered by growing anger over Israel's handling of the prisoner 
issue. ``In clashes, rocks are thrown,'' Barghouti said. ``This car 
stopped with the soldier and they took his weapon. It was later returned. 
They did not use it to kill.'' Netanyahu said Thursday that the Palestinian 
Authority had raised false expectations concerning the prisoners. 
``They have to stop promising them things Israel never promised,'' 
he said. ``We would never, ever release terrorist murderers, ever.'' 
Arafat brought up the issue earlier this week with Clinton in meetings 
in Washington, and Palestinian negotiators said the U.S. president 
promised to do his utmost to resolve the issue.
