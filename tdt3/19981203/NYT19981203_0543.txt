Cindy Parlow and Siri Mullinix left their respective high schools 
a year early to join the North Carolina women's soccer team. Parlow, 
a forward, is the team's leading scorer and has twice been the national 
player of the year. Mullinix is the best goalie on the top team in 
the country. This weekend, the two seniors will end their collegiate 
careers at the National Collegiate Athletic Association final four. 
North Carolina, the two-time defending champion, will play Portland 
at 4:30 p.m. Friday after Santa Clara plays Florida at 2 p.m. The 
final will be Sunday at 1 p.m. ``If you're going to bring a player 
in early, she should be national caliber, both as an athlete and student,'' 
North Carolina Coach Anson Dorrance said. ``The N.C.A.A. has all kinds 
of regulations about early departure from high school, and it just 
happened that we had two players who wanted to come early and who 
could the same year. It did happen once before for us. You might recognize 
the name, Mia Hamm.'' Hamm is considered the best player in the world 
in women's soccer. Parlow and Mullinix earned General Educational 
Development degrees through correspondence courses and community colleges 
in the summer of 1995. ``I felt there wasn't anything more I could 
accomplish at the club and high school level,'' said Mullinix, a native 
of Greensboro, who was the most valuable defensive player of last 
year's tournament. ``I knew I could come in and play one year behind 
an all-American and then have a chance to play three years at the 
best level college soccer has.'' Mullinix developed into an all-American 
by her junior season and has allowed only 6 goals in 24 games this 
season. Tony DiCicco, the United States National Team coach, has invited 
Mullinix to join the residency training camp in preparation for the 
1999 World Cup. ``Because we're always so strong offensively, goalkeepers 
here haven't always gotten the credit they deserve,'' said her teammate 
Tiffany Roberts. She added, referring to shots: ``Think about this, 
she has the best players in the world pounding her in practice every 
day. Believe me, she holds her own.'' Parlow left her Memphis high 
school because she wanted a chance at making the 1996 Olympic team, 
which she did as a reserve. ``Cindy has fulfilled every possible dream 
and expectation I had for her career and surpassed them,'' said Dorrance, 
whose teams have won 14 of the 16 NCAA championships. ``I felt she 
could come in and play at a national level immediately, and she did. 
I felt she could win college player of the year, and she did. I felt 
she could make the national team, and she did.''
