It's been more than two decades since hip-hop first surfaced on the 
mean streets of New York, and in those 20-odd years, it's evolved 
from a spontaneous form of neighborhood entertainment _ small groups 
of kids break dancing and grooving to local partymasters rapping to 
mixes of old records _ to a worldwide, multimillion dollar business, 
encompassing not just music but fashion, videos, movies and advertisements. 
In his knowledgeable, opinionated and often fascinating book ``Hip-Hop 
America,'' Nelson George, the author of the critically acclaimed book 
``The Death of Rhythm and Blues,'' chronicles the evolution of hip-hop, 
from its inception with artists like Grandmaster Flash and Kool Herc 
through its current state in the wake of the deaths of Tupac Shakur 
and the Notorious B.I.G. He anatomizes hip-hop's post-modern esthetic, 
situates its development within a social and political context, and 
provides the lay reader with quick, knowing sketches of some of its 
most influential producers (including Rick Rubin, Teddy Riley, Dr. 
Dre and Puff Daddy). George does not pull his punches. He suggests 
that the mid-90's feud between East Coast and West Coast rappers ``wasn't 
a feud at all, but a figment of the paranoid minds in the Death Row 
camp.'' He complains that ``there is an adolescent quality to hip-hop 
culture that makes it clear that most of its expressions are aimed 
to please teen-age boys.'' And he challenges the myth that hip-hop 
was, in its earliest days, ``solely African-American created, owned, 
controlled and consumed,'' arguing that ``without white entrepreneurial 
involvement hip-hop culture wouldn't have survived its first half 
decade on vinyl.'' George writes with the ardor of a longtime hip-hop 
fan (and close associate of many of the people who played a formative 
role in its development) and the analytic detachment of a critic, 
and his book is animated by a passion for the music and frustration 
with its often insular point of view. While George laments the misogynistic 
outlook of groups like 2 Live Crew and argues that ``many folks raised 
on hip-hop have bought into a very limited view of life'' defined 
almost solely by the dogma of the streets, he is also quick to take 
issue with those who have lumped together highly disparate artists 
under the umbrella of gangsta rap and dismissed it as a nihilistic 
effort to appeal to angry suburban teen-agers by trading on black 
stereotypes. Gangsta rap, George argues, was a response to the crack 
epidemic of the '80s and the socioeconomic plight of the black underclass 
under Reaganomics, and it played upon the familiar pop-culture tropes 
of rebellion and revenge while mirroring the alienation of inner-city 
youths. He contends that the growing number of young black men in 
prison during those years (one 1990 study estimated that one in four 
African-American men between the ages of 20 and 29 was behind bars 
or on probation) created a ``dispassionate view of violence'' among 
many urban blacks and popularized a prison-based credo predicated 
upon ``suspicion of women, loyalty to the crew, adoption of a stone 
face in confronting the world, hatred of authority'': many of the 
very values embraced by the gangsta rap of Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre 
and N.W.A. As the crack epidemic has receded in the late '90s, gangsta 
rap has also waned, but its West Coast version (as packaged by Dr. 
Dre and Suge Knight), George says,will endure ``as an essential part 
of the historical memory of Southern California in the '80s and '90s.'' 
``Just as the Beach Boys spoke for an idealistic vision of the area 
in the '60s,'' he writes, ``and the Eagles presented a cynical, mellow 
view in the '70s, the recordings from the Compton/Long Beach axis 
tell the story of the poverty, guns and despair that everyone noticed 
after the 1992 riots _ riots that had been happening on CDs all along.'' 
Although groups like Public Enemy have tackled politics, hip-hop has 
never been an overtly ideological form; its practitioners, George 
points out, are ``not social activists by training or inclination,'' 
but ``entertainers whose visibility and effectiveness as messengers 
are subject to the whims of the marketplace.'' Indeed, the central 
tenets of hip-hop (rebellion, aggression, materialism) have not only 
struck a chord with a mass audience of teen-agers, but have also proven 
to be remarkably successful marketing tools for a host of products 
from clothing to liquor to soft drinks. After Adidas and Run-D.M.C. 
made a $1.5 million deal in the mid-'80s, the alliance between hip-hop 
and fashion took off. By 1996, George reports, Tommy Hilfiger had 
become the No. 1 apparel company traded on the New York Stock Exchange, 
``due primarily to his embrace of hip-hop and the large suburban audience 
excited by that urban prep look.'' At the same time, as music videos 
and shows like ``Yo, MTV Raps!'' spread the latest, up-to-the-minute 
hip-hop fashions to the world, cinematographers and stylists began 
to play a more and more important role, transforming what was ``once 
an underground music based on beats and rhymes'' into ``the most image-driven 
part of pop music.'' Despite such changes, George does not foresee 
hip-hop becoming co-opted and compromised the way soul music was in 
the '60s. He argues that the social conditions that forged hip-hop 
_ poverty, drugs, deteriorating schools _ continue to be problems, 
and that hip-hop continues to reflect and internalize ``our society's 
woes.'' ``Unlike so many other underground cultural expressions,'' 
he writes, ``hip-hop has managed to remain vital, abrasive and edgy 
for two decades. The culture's connection to the African-American 
working and underclass, people usually without a media voice, enables 
it to communicate dreams and emotions that make outsiders uncomfortable. 
When even Sony Playstation features a gentle childlike rapper, it 
doesn't fatally undercut or mitigate the force of roughneck M.C.'s 
like Mobb Deep or Wu-Tang. Somehow hip-hop survives even the crassest 
commercialism or, at least, it has so far.'' PUBLICATION NOTES: HIP-HOP
