The courtship was a whirlwind. The German-American nuptials were lavish. 
And, for now, DaimlerChrysler AG appears to be in wedded bliss. With 
the honeymoon on, what better time to look at the dowry that Chrysler 
Corp., which last month ceased to exist as an independent company, 
brought to that union? Like most auto companies, Chrysler produced 
its share of the ingenious and ignominious. From its beginnings, it 
was known for engineering innovations: the very first Chrysler, in 
1924, had four-wheel hydraulic brakes, not the cable-activated mechanical 
brakes of competitors. In 1928, Chrysler bought out Dodge Brothers 
and brought out both the midpriced De Soto and the low-priced Plymouth. 
By 1936, it was the country's No. 2 automaker, behind General Motors 
and just ahead of Ford, which was playing catch-up in midpriced cars. 
Through the years Chrysler boasted a string of innovations, including 
the first power steering, the great ``hemi'' V8 and the first modern 
minivan. There were also the less-than-successes: the Airflow, an 
innovative but homely design that did not catch on; the sleekly finned 
cars of the late 50s that were boldly styled but badly built, and 
the premature downsizing for 1962 of the company's bread-and-butter 
Plymouths and Dodges, which sank when they shrank. Then there was 
the debacle of the 1970s, when Chrysler was selling little that the 
public wanted, resulting in a brush with bankruptcy. Lee A. Iacocca, 
the company's chairman, sold Congress on $1.5 billion in loan guarantees, 
saving the company. And the rest is history.
