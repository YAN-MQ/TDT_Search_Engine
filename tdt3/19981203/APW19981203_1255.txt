A Cabinet minister told Parliament Thursday that sugar imports from 
neighbor and longtime rival Pakistan should be stopped because they 
hurt domestic producers. Replying to questions from lawmakers, Parliamentary 
Affairs Minister M.L. Khurana was quoted by Dow Jones News Service 
as saying ``some steps should be undertaken to stop (imports from 
Pakistan) .... Some will be taken very soon in a day or two. Some 
final decision will be taken.'' ``The government of India agrees with 
the view that Indian sugar should be protected because it is suffering 
due to imports from Pakistan,'' he said in Hindi. India allowed zero-duty 
sugar imports until April 28 this year when it imposed a 5 percent 
import duty plus an 850 rupees (dlrs 20) a ton countervailing duty. 
Domestic producers have long been demanding higher duties to protect 
them from cheap imports from neighboring Pakistan.
