Spanish workers were planning mass demonstrations in 51 cities Thursday 
to demand a 35-hour week and protest both low unemployment benefit 
levels and a government tax reform. The country's two main labor federations 
_ the General Workers Union and the Workers' Commissions _ put aside 
recent differences to call on their members to participate in marches 
around the country from 7 p.m. (1800gmt) onwards. In a joint statement 
the federations demanded a reduction of the working week to 35 hours 
``as an efficient way of creating more and better jobs.'' The government 
has made much of recent reductions in unemployment, but Spanish jobless 
figures remain far higher than the European average, with over 19 
percent of people eligible to work out of job. The protest marches 
were also called to demand improved benefits for the unemployed, particularly 
the long-term jobless with few chances of finding new employment. 
In their statement the unions claimed that half of those without a 
job do not currently receive economic benefits. A tax reform promising 
rate cuts to come into effect in 1999 is perceived by the unions as 
a ``present for the rich,'' and constitutes a third reason to march 
,according to their statement. They reject government claims that 
the reform, predicted to reduce tax revenue by 600 billion pesetas 
(dlrs 4.3 billion), will benefit low income families most and promote 
economic growth by encouraging people to spend, save and invest. Instead 
the unions point out that basic tax for people in the top tax bracket 
falls from 56 percent to 48 percent, the minimum tax level only drops 
from 20 percent to 18 percent. They say that economic growth would 
be far better served by government spending on social projects and 
job creation. Thursday's labor protest call was supported by left-leaning 
political parties, including the main opposition Socialist party and 
the United Left _ Spain's third political force United Left. They 
mark a movement away from the relatively cordial relations between 
the unions and the two-year-old conservative government of Prime Minister 
Jose Maria Aznar that were maintained in part due to negotiations 
over labor contract norms.
