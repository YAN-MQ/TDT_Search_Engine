Zimbabwe is demanding South Africa extradite fugitive Canaan Banana, 
a former president convicted of sodomy and indecent assault. A spokesman 
for President Mugabe made the statement after learning President Nelson 
Mandela held private talks Wednesday with him in South Africa. Mr. 
Mandela is not -- has not responded to the demand, and it is not clear 
whether Mr. Banana is still in South Africa. He fled Harare just before 
his conviction in absentia last week.
