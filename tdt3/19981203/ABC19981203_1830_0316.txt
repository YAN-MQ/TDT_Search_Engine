Overseas, in the Philippines, there has been a terrible tragedy. 28 
people, mostly children, were killed when a fire tore through an orphanage 
just before dawn. Here's our chief Asia correspondent, Mark Litke. 
By the time the first firefighters arrived, it was already too late. 
Several children were heard screaming for help. The voices were soon 
silenced. With first light, the full extent of the tragedy was revealed. 
In one room, 13 small bodies. In another area, the body of an adult 
holding two infants. Relatives and neighbors alike were overcome by 
it all. Investigators suspect faulty electrical wiring in the aging 
building. The children who survived have no idea how it started. They 
were just fortunate to have run in the right direction. This was to 
have been a day of celebration at the church-run orphanage. Today 
would have been the annual Christmas party. Mark Litke, ABC News, 
Tokyo.
