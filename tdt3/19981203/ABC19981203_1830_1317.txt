As Ned Potter just mentioned, road traffic is an increasing source 
of noise, not so much from cars, but from the tires, and roads in 
Europe, they have found a way to muffle the volume by as much as 70%. 
ABC's Richard Gizbert reports, starting in London. This looks like 
any other busy four-Lane road, but it doesn't sound like one. It's 
much quieter. I live in that house there. I don't hear half the traffic 
going by. For that, he can thank traffic noise experts at this lab 
in paris. Some of that noise is going here. It's absorbed by tiny 
rubber granules, recycled from old tires. If you mix this with the 
stuff that most road surfaces are made of -- two types of gravel and 
the binder that glues it all together -- what you get is a rubber 
road. They've experimented with rubber in roads before, but as recycling 
projects, not to combat noise pollution. To understand how to make 
a quiet road, one must first dissect traffic noise. It used to be 
the engine was the main culprit, but now -- It's not from the car 
engines. The noises between the tires hitting the road surface. This 
car is on a rubber road. Listen to the difference when it hits a harder, 
conventional surface, in about two seconds. The company that makes 
rubber roads has taken the extraordinary step of advertising them 
on French TV. It believes everyone should know that even if they cost 
10% more, there are alternatives to the noise that surrounds us. Richard 
Gizbert, ABC News, Paris.
