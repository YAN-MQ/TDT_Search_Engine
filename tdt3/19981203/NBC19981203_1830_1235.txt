A fast-moving fire in the Philippines this morning left at least 28 
people -- Mostly young children -- dead. The rundown building housed 
an orphanage, which also served as a baby sitting service for parents 
working the night shift. Security bars on the windows turned it into 
a death trap. Witnesses said they could hear the children screaming 
to get out. Officials said the likely cause was bad wiring.
