Foreign minsters of the OSCE on Thursday urged all parties in the 
Kosovo conflict to seek a peaceful solution, and gave full backing 
to the 2,000 monitors being sent to the Yugoslav province in a risky 
mission to ease tensions. The two day ministerial meeting of the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe concluded with 18 pages of 
declarations, including one on the Kosovo conflict, where hundreds 
have died and hundreds of thousands have fled ethnic violence. ``The 
plight of so many people in Kosovo caught up in violent confrontation 
and fleeing their homes in fear has moved us all,'' said the declaration, 
which was adopted by consensus. ``There is still violence in Kosovo, 
and this is of deep concern to us.'' The OSCE is sending 2,000 unarmed 
monitors, in its biggest and most dangerous mission ever, to oversee 
terms of a truce reached with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
in October, under the threat to NATO air strikes. The ministers adopted 
their resolution at roughly the same as Yugoslav border guards killed 
eight ethnic Albanian rebels in the worst violation yet of that cease-fire. 
The ministers urged Yugoslav authorities and ethnic Albanian rebels 
in Kosovo to ``stop the violence and resolved their differences by 
peaceful means.'' ``There is a wide consensus on the importance of 
the OSCE involvement in Kosovo, which represents both a challenge 
and an opportunity for the OSCE,'' said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw 
Geremek, outgoing chairman of the OSCE. Yugoslavia was suspended from 
the OSCE in 1992 for allegedly stirring up ethnic violence in the 
Balkans. Milosevic is still widely seen as an obstacle to peace, but 
the ministers stopped short of criticizing the president or his government. 
Geremek said the declaration was reached through ``the painful, painful 
act of consensus.'' He refused to discuss what was said during the 
closed meeting, in which some nations were believed to have called 
for sharp rebuke of Yugoslavia. Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, 
who assumes the OSCE's rotating chairmanship in January, said the 
biggest challenge will be the Kosovo conflict, with the monitor team 
now at about 500 and expected to reach full strength by mid-January. 
``Kosovo is by far the greatest challenge this organization has ever 
faced,'' he said in closing remarks to the meeting. ``A successful 
mission will contribute to stability and security not only in Kosovo, 
but in the entire region.'' Apart from Kosovo, the ministers made 
a series of decisions that Geremek describing as important, but ``without 
breakthroughs or sensational elements.'' Among the 11 issues covered 
in their final declaration was a decision to move ahead with drafting 
a Charter on European Security at the next years OSCE summit, which 
the statement said would be in Istanbul, Turkey on Nov. 14-15, 1999. 
The ministers also appointed Austria to serve as chairman in 2000. 
Although the meeting from about 45 countries, some key countries _ 
including the United States and Britain _ sent lower-ranking delegations. 
Non-members including Japan and South Korea sent observers to the 
meeting.
