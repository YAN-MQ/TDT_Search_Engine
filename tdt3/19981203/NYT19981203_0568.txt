Let's see if we have this right. A well-intentioned third-grade teacher, 
who happens to be white, gave her mostly black and Hispanic students 
a critically praised book about a black girl with kinky hair. Then 
parents came to Public School 75, in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Heaven forbid 
that they should have troubled themselves to read the book, ``Nappy 
Hair.'' They might have found that it is about a young heroine who 
celebrates that which makes her special. With ignorance in full bloom, 
they had no problem denouncing the teacher as a racist, often in words 
of four letters. A couple of them, whose children are not in the third 
grade, went so far as to menace her _ ``We're going to get you,'' 
one said _ and to scream anti-white slurs. So who did the school authorities 
choose to investigate first? The well-meaning teacher, or the foul-mouthed, 
harm-threatening parents? The teacher, of course. She stood accused, 
however falsely, of being ``racially insensitive.'' And in the touchy-feely 
twilight of this century, few sins will land you in purgatory faster 
than presumed insensitivity, especially on a matter of race, sex, 
religion, national origin or sexual orientation. The good news is 
that it took school officials little time to realize that the teacher, 
Ruth Sherman, was guilty of no transgression more serious than failing 
to clear the book with her principal. The parents of her students 
praised her lavishly, as did administrators at PS 75 and the local 
district, No. 32. Having immediately yanked her from her classroom 
(it was for her own safety, they would later say, not in response 
to the racism charge), the authorities asked Ms. Sherman to return. 
She declined out of fear for her safety. This may be a good place 
to note that despite the occasional well-publicized incident, physical 
attacks on teachers by parents are relatively uncommon in New York's 
public schools. Most assaults on staff members are by students, and 
their numbers have been falling sharply, according to records kept 
by the United Federation of Teachers. There were 913 in the 1997-98 
school year, or fewer than half the record 1,902 of four years earlier. 
Still, they were 913 assaults too many, and as Ms. Sherman observed 
Thursday, ``How do I know that someone won't spit at me, or push me?'' 
She expects to be reassigned, perhaps on Friday, to a school in another 
borough. Perhaps that is where this unpleasant episode should rest. 
Ms. Sherman, 27, is prepared to let it go. ``There's so much tension 
in that community that I don't want to stir another pot,'' she said 
Thursday. ``I don't want to cause more tension. I'm not a rabble-rouser.'' 
But this incident won't disappear right away, because there is a larger 
issue. The message that her instant removal from the classroom sent 
to many New Yorkers was that a charge of racism, no matter how knee-jerk 
and baseless, will get you into hot water more readily than threatening 
someone with possible bodily harm. Ms. Sherman's nascent teaching 
career was turned upside down for no reason. What action has been 
taken against the menacing parents? Thus far, 11 days later, nothing. 
And from the often-voluble schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, there has 
been not a public word. So much for the lesson that parents are supposed 
to instill in their children: Behave responsibly, for actions have 
consequences. District 32 considered asking the police to get involved, 
but then dropped the idea. Just as well, a Police Department spokesman 
said. The threats against Ms. Sherman were too vague for criminal 
charges. OK, what then might qualify as the ``appropriate action'' 
promised early this week by the district superintendent, Felix Vasquez? 
Vasquez would not discuss the issue Thursday. But a Board of Education 
spokesman, J.D. LaRock, said the PS 75 principal ``would talk to the 
parents and tell them that they behaved inappropriately and that they 
have to behave appropriately when they're in a school.'' That's it? 
``We're hoping that with all the attention focused on this episode, 
the lesson has been learned,'' LaRock said. At the board's office, 
apparently, optimism reigns. As a coda, it might be noted that two 
years ago Ms. Sherman tutored the daughter of a woman who threatened 
her last week. The girl's reading scores went up, the teacher said. 
Ironic, some would say. Others might find it all very sad.
