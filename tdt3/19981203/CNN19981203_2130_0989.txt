Vehicle sales have reached a new landmark. Automakers released their 
final November sales figures today. And for the first time, Americans 
have purchased more new pickups, vans and sport utility vehicles than 
standard cars. Overall sales figures for the big three were also available. 
GM says its vehicle sales were down 5.6% from this time last year. 
Ford reports its sales rose slightly. Daimler-Chrysler says its U.S. 
sales increased 7%.
