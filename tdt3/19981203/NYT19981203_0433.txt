CBS announced Thursday that the new CBS News program ``60 Minutes 
II,'' a spinoff of the 30-year-old Sunday evening news magazine program, 
will make its debut on Wednesday, Jan. 13, at 9 p.m., and will have 
Wednesdays from 9 to 10 p.m. as its regular time slot. The new show 
has four correspondents: Dan Rather, the anchor and managing editor 
of ``CBS Evening News''; two CBS News correspondents, Bob Simon and 
Vicki Mabrey, and Charlie Rose, who will also continue as producer 
and host of his weeknight interview program for public television. 
The executive producer, Jeff Fager, was most recently the executive 
producer of ``CBS Evening News.'' The new program faced potential 
competition from NBC's ``Dateline'' if the network moved that program 
from 8 to 9 p.m. But in reshuffling its prime-time lineup this week, 
NBC did not move the Wednesday edition of ``Dateline.'' Don Hewitt, 
the executive producer of ``60 Minutes,'' and others inside CBS News 
opposed an added version when the idea was first broached, fearing 
it would dilute the franchise. But the original program dependably 
draws such a large audience that CBS executives wanted to extend its 
reach to another night.
