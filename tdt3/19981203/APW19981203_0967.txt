Soccer officials on Thursday named Trott Moloto to coach the South 
African national team through to the end of the African Nations Cup 
in March 2000. South African Football Association chief executive 
Raymond Hack made the announcement. As caretaker coach for the past 
four months, Moloto coached Bafana Bafana _ or ``The Boys'', as the 
national team is known in the Zulu language _ in their 1-0 triumph 
against Angola in the African Nations Cup qualifier in October. ``I 
am really honored that I am to lead Bafana Bafana,'' Moloto said. 
``I am going to continue the work of past coaches like Screamer Tshabalala, 
Augusto Palacios, Clive Barker and Jomo Sono. They have shown commitment 
in serving the nation.'' The selection committee also considered South 
Africans Ron Atkinson and Shakes Mashaba; Brazil's Carlos Alberto 
Parreira, who coached Saudi Arabia at the World Cup; Dutchman Ruud 
Krol; and Gordon Igesund, coach of the South African team Manning 
Rangers. Moloto takes over a team whose morale slumped after their 
failure in the World Cup earlier this year. South Africa were eliminated 
in the first round after losing 3-0 to France, drawing 1-1 with Denmark 
and drawing 2-2 with Saudi Arabia, under French soccer coach Philippe 
Troussier. Moloto said he would make some changes in the team for 
a match against Egypt, the current African Nations Cup champions, 
in Johannesburg Dec. 16.
