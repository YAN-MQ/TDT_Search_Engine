The one big exception to the generally down session on Wall Street 
was the stock of Ticketmaster/Online. That's the show ticket sales 
company which began trading today. It was issued at $14 a share, soared 
to $60, and finally closed just over $40. Too bad we all don't have 
stock in Ticketmaster.
