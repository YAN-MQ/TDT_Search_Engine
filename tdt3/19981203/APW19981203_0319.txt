The government needs to come up with a more detailed economic recovery 
plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Thursday, just a day after 
the International Monetary Fund chief left without promising Moscow 
any new loans. Primakov's government has produced an anti-crisis program, 
but the measures have not reversed the country's economic slide, nor 
have they found favor with the IMF or other international lenders 
that have frozen loans to Russia. Primakov acknowledged the need to 
spell out the government's intentions more clearly and called on the 
Cabinet to approve a more detailed document. ``Without such a concrete 
action plan, containing concrete tasks and time frames, the government's 
steps will look merely like intentions,'' Primakov said. IMF chief 
Michel Camdessus left Russia on Wednesday after meeting with Primakov 
and other top officials. He praised Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course 
in dealing with the crisis, but said an IMF team would have to return 
to Russia next month for further negotiations on loans to Russia. 
The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package this summer, 
but only about dlrs 5 billion was disbursed before Russia's economic 
crisis hit in August and the loans were frozen. The IMF has indicated 
that Russia's draft budget for next year appears overly optimistic, 
and it also does not like moves to increase the government's role 
in the economy. Meanwhile, the speaker of Russia's parliament lashed 
out at the IMF for refusing to release loans. ``Look how they are 
mocking our government, sending one group after another,'' said Gennady 
Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker for the State Duma, parliament's 
lower house. ``Now Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until 
tomorrow.'' Seleznyov suggested that Russia print more money to pay 
off its debts and then refuse to take any more loans. ``It's high 
time to take these shackles off Russia's feet,'' he told reporters. 
In other economic developments Thursday: _ Sberbank, the giant state-savings 
bank, has begun to service individual accounts that were transferred 
to the bank from six ailing commercial banks. The government in September 
guaranteed the savings accounts of all depositors who moved their 
money from the troubled commercial banks into Sberbank. Many individuals 
took the offer, though some keep their money in commercial banks, 
which are still struggling to survive. _ Inflation was up 5.7 percent 
in November, compared to 4.5 percent in October, the State Statistics 
Committee said. Inflation has calmed since shooting up in August and 
September in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. However, inflation 
is up about 70 percent compared to last December, Central Bank chief 
Viktor Gerashchenko said Wednesday. _ Russia's hard currency reserves 
dropped by dlrs 200 million in the last week of November and stood 
at dlrs 12.8 billion on Nov. 27, the Central Bank said Thursday. It 
didn't give a reason, though the government spent some of its reserves 
to service foreign debts during this period.
