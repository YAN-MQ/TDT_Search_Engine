El Salvador blamed a sharp rise in inflation for November on Hurricane 
Mitch, saying price-gouging after the disaster had caused prices to 
rise across the board. November's inflation was 2.2 percent, the highest 
monthly rate in three years and double the rates of previous months, 
which were between 1 percent and 1.3 percent, the Central Reserve 
Bank said Thursday. It said food prices in particular had risen, despite 
the arrest of some price-gougers. El Salvador's agricultural sector 
was heavily affected by the storm, which killed 239 people here a 
month ago. Across Central America, Mitch killed more than 9,000 people 
and caused at least dlrs 4 billion in damage.
