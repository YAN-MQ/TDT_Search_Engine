Roy P. Benavidez, a former Green Beret sergeant who received the Medal 
of Honor from President Ronald Reagan for heroism while wounded in 
the Vietnam War, then fought to keep the government from cutting off 
his disability payments, died Nov. 29 at Brooke Army Medical Center 
in San Antonio. He was 63. Benavidez, who lived in El Campo, Texas, 
suffered respiratory failure, the hospital said. His right leg was 
amputated in October because of complications of diabetes. On the 
morning of May 2, 1968, Benavidez, a staff sergeant with the Army's 
Special Forces _ the Green Berets _ heard the cry ``get us out of 
here'' over his unit's radio while at his base in Loc Ninh, South 
Vietnam. He also heard ``so much shooting, it sounded like a popcorn 
machine.'' The call for aid came from a 12-man Special Forces team 
_ 3 Green Berets and 9 Montagnard tribesmen _ that had been ambushed 
by North Vietnamese troops at a jungle site a few miles inside Cambodia. 
Benavidez jumped aboard an evacuation helicopter that flew to the 
scene. ``When I got on that copter, little did I know we were going 
to spend six hours in hell,'' he later recalled. After leaping off 
the helicopter, Benavidez was shot in the face, head and right leg, 
but he ran toward his fellow troops, finding four dead and the others 
wounded. He dragged survivors aboard the helicopter, but its pilot 
was killed by enemy fire as he tried to take off, and the helicopter 
crashed and burned. Benavidez got the troops off the helicopter, and 
over the next six hours, he organized return fire, called in air strikes, 
administered morphine and recovered classified documents, although 
he got shot in the stomach and thigh and hit in the back by grenade 
fragments. He was bayoneted by a North Vietnamese soldier, whom he 
killed with a knife. Finally, he shot two enemy soldiers as he dragged 
the survivors aboard another evacuation helicopter. When he arrived 
at Loc Ninh, Benavidez was unable to move or speak. Just as he was 
about to be placed into a body bag, he spit into a doctor's face to 
signal that he was still alive and was evacuated for surgery in Saigon. 
Benavidez was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1968, but 
a subsequent recommendation from his commanding officer that he receive 
the Medal of Honor _ the military's highest award for valor _ could 
not be approved until a witness confirmed his deeds. That happened 
in 1980, when Brian O'Connor, the Green Beret who had radioed the 
frantic message seeking evacuation, was found in the Fiji Islands. 
O'Connor told how Benavidez had rescued eight members of his patrol 
despite being wounded repeatedly. Reagan presented the Medal of Honor 
to Benavidez at the Pentagon on Feb. 24, 1981. Shortly before Memorial 
Day 1983, Benavidez came forward to say that the Social Security Administration 
planned to cut off disability payments he had been receiving since 
he retired from the Army as a master sergeant in 1976. He still had 
two pieces of shrapnel in his heart and a punctured lung and was in 
constant pain from his wounds. The government, as part of a cost-cutting 
review that had led to the termination of disability assistance to 
350,000 people over the preceding two years, had decided that Benavidez 
could find employment. ``It seems like they want to open up your wounds 
and pour a little salt in,'' Benavidez said. ``I don't like to use 
my Medal of Honor for political purposes or personal gain, but if 
they can do this to me, what will they do to all the others?'' A White 
House spokesman said that Reagan was ``personally concerned'' about 
Benavidez's situation, and 10 days later Health and Human Services 
Secretary Margaret Heckler said the disability reviews would become 
more ``humane and compassionate.'' Soon afterward, wearing his Medal 
of Honor, Benavidez told the House Select Committee on Aging that 
``the administration that put this medal around my neck is curtailing 
my benefits.'' Benavidez appealed the termination of assistance to 
an administrative law judge, who ruled in July 1983 that he should 
continue receiving payments. When Reagan presented Benavidez with 
the Medal of Honor, he asked the former sergeant to speak to young 
people. Benavidez did, visiting schools to stress the need for the 
education he never had. Born in south Texas, the son of a sharecopper, 
Benavidez was orphaned as a youngster. He went to live with an uncle, 
but dropped out of middle school because he was needed to pick sugar 
beets and cotton. He joined the Army at 19, went to airborne school, 
then was injured by a land mine in South Vietnam in 1964. Doctors 
feared he would never walk again, but he recovered and became a Green 
Beret. He was on his second Vietnam tour when he carried out his rescue 
mission. Benavidez is survived by his wife, Hilaria; a son, Noel; 
two daughters, Yvette Garcia and Denise Prochazka; a brother, Roger; 
five stepbrothers, Mike, Eugene, Frank, Nick and Juquin Benavidez; 
four sisters, Mary Martinez, Lupe Chavez, Helene Vallejo and Eva Campos, 
and three grandchildren. Over the years, fellow Texans paid tribute 
to Benavidez. Several schools, a National Guard armory and an Army 
Reserve center were named for him. But he did not regard himself as 
someone special. ``The real heroes are the ones who gave their lives 
for their country,'' Benavidez once said. ``I don't like to be called 
a hero. I just did what I was trained to do.''
