Russia's currency slid to its lowest point in months Thursday amid 
fears that the nation has started printing money to make up for a 
loss in foreign aid. The ruble's fall came a day after International 
Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus left Moscow without promising 
to free up frozen loans that Russia badly wants to dig itself out 
of its latest economic crisis. Without the money, dealers warned Thursday, 
Russia's government has run out of alternatives to printing rubles. 
Some reported signs that the money-printing has already begun. Printing 
money can cause high inflation. But Russia owes billions of dollars 
to workers, pensioners and foreign creditors and has warned repeatedly 
that it would resort to printing money unless it gets more foreign 
loans. The Central Bank tried to support the currency Thursday, spending 
hard-currency reserves to buy rubles on the currency market _ a move 
that usually increases the demand for the ruble and drives its rate 
back up. Despite the bank's efforts, traders said the currency still 
fell to its lowest rate since September: 20 to the dollar, from 19.1 
on Wednesday. The IMF and other lenders froze a $22.6 billion aid 
package to Russia after the government defaulted on its treasury debts 
and devalued the ruble in August. The speaker of the lower house of 
parliament called Thursday for breaking with the IMF and cranking 
up the money-printing presses. ``Look how they are mocking our government, 
sending one group after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist. 
``Now Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.'' 
Seleznyov suggested that Russia print money to pay off its debts and 
then refuse to take any more loans. ``It's high time to take these 
shackles off Russia's feet,'' he told reporters. The leader of the 
reformist party Our Home is Russia ridiculed Seleznyov's proposal. 
``If the IMF accepted rubles for debt payments, it would be a brilliant 
method,'' Alexander Shokhin said on the ``Hero of the Day'' TV program. 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, apparently still hopeful about IMF 
money, said Thursday the government needs to come up with a more detailed 
plan for economic recovery. Primakov's government has produced a general 
anti-crisis program, but the measures have not reversed the country's 
economic slide, nor have they found favor with the IMF. Camdessus 
said an IMF team would return to Russia next month for further negotiations.
