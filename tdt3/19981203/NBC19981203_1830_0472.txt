Still ahead -- the manhunt that's coming up empty. NBC news "in depth." 
Will the most wanted man in Texas ever be found? We will bring him 
back dead or alive. It really doesn't make any difference in my opinion, 
which that might be. The search for a death row inmate. Is he just 
too smart to get caught? And -- is the fire going out on the impeachment 
inquiry? Why the latest republican strategy crumbled. Man, that Chili 
was hot. You got heartburn, too? Yeah. Wanna try these new pepcid 
ac chewables? It says you gotta take it with water. What's the water 
for? With tums, you don't need water. Just because new pepcid is chewable 
doesn't mean it works like tums. Tums calcium knocks out heartburn 
fast. Pepcid chewables' famotidine has to go through your bloodstream, 
so it takes 40 minutes just to start working. You wanna go back for 
water? Forget the water. Pass the tums. Tums ta tum tum tums let's 
say the puppy's a salesperson in an average computer store. Now, ask 
the salesperson a question. What's the difference between dvd and 
CD-rom? How much ram do I really need? Oh, and can you guys install 
software? Okay... thanks. We built a different place to buy a computer.
