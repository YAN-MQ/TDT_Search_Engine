Proof has arrived in our newsroom tonight that winter does exist. 
In fact, it has arrived this evening in at least one part of the country. 
The 76er region of California. This is just about an hour east of 
Sacramento, California. These pictures are just a few minutes old. 
You see a semi there and a road clearing vehicle there. Visibility 
down to almost nothing in some of the snow squalls. It can happen. 
Just not in mess places right now. Time for a look at the weather 
across the country. For that we go to WNBC-television in New York, 
meteorologist Janice huff. When is it coming? The kerled may say December 
but mother nature says springtime across most of the east as numerous 
cities set record high temperatures today including New York City 
at 69 degrees. Charleston, South Carolina was up to 80 and even as 
far north as green bay, wisconsin, where the record high today was 
62 degrees. Now, as we check the rest of the weather for tonight -- 
stormy weather continuing across parts of New England and also over 
the parts of Texas. Some thunderstorms into Oklahoma, more snow for 
the cascades. Temperatures tonight will be in the teens and 20's over 
the northwest, but still mild in the east. 40's and 50's and even 
some 60's overnight. Tomorrow's highs -- look at how cool it's going 
to be in Los Angeles. In the 50's of most of southern California. 
Will be warmer in the city. Highs in the 60's and could see more records. 
Specifically 58 in L.A. compare that to 69 in Boston. Boston will 
be warmer than southern California tomorrow. 70 in Atlanta. Chicago 
55. More showers for Seattle and look where the cold air is. It's 
right there. 39 degrees. The cold air remains banked up behind the 
jetstream in the northwest. It's going to shift a little bit towards 
the east by the weekend. A snowstorm is expected to develop over the 
northern plains, so some areas in Minnesota and in Iowa that saw record 
high temperatures today, you could see record low temperatures and 
snow by Sunday. In the meantime, the northeast, the southeast, long 
the gulf coast remains unseasonably warm into the weekend. That's 
the weather around the nation, Brian. Now back to you. Janice huff, 
WNBC-television tonight.
