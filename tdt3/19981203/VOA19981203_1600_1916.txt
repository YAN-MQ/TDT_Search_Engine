U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan says he will travel to Libya Saturday 
to discuss the extradition of two Lockerbie bombing suspects. Mr. 
Annan, who is in Tunisia on a previously scheduled trip, is likely 
to travel to the coastal town of Surt and meet with Libyan leader 
Muammar Qaddafi. The 1988 attack on a Pan Am jet over Scotland killed 
270 people.
