Representatives for the National Basketball Association team owners 
and players are scheduled to meet again later today, but the season 
remains in jeopardy. The talks come nearly two weeks after the last 
full bargaining session in New York. A session scheduled for last 
Saturday was canceled when players union head, Billy Hunter, refused 
to abide by conditions set down by the league. The owners locked players 
out July 1st claiming that players are making too much money for some 
teams to stay in business. The players say they should be allowed 
to earn as much as the market will allow. The labor dispute has led 
to the cancellation of 203 games so far this season. The fate of the 
rest of the season remains in doubt, especially if the two sides cannot 
reach agreement before the Christmas holiday.
