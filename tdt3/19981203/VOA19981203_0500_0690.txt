U.S. officials are now pressing Pakistan on another matter, the situation 
in Afghanistan and helping to bring to justice Saudi exile Osama bin 
Laden. Washington believes the man indicted in New York in connection 
with the deadly terrorist bombings of the American embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania remains in Afghanistan and beyond the reach of U.S. law 
enforcement. Pakistan has been helpful in bringing to justice terrorist 
suspects in the past. Again, Assistant Secretary of State Inderford. 
In our view about bin Laden is very simple. He is a terrorist. He 
is a murderer. He plans to kill again, and we want him brought to 
justice. And that view was made very clear to our Pakistani guests. 
A grand jury in New York has issued a 238 count indictment charging 
Osama bin Laden with the embassy bombings which killed more than 200 
people including 12 Americans. Nick Simeone, VOA News at the White 
House.
