Incoming U.S. House Speaker Bob Livingston said Thursday he hopes 
the House wraps up its impeachment inquiry by the end of the month 
but held out the possibility it could carry over to the next year 
unless the Judiciary Committee completes its work next week. ``I can't 
say I'd be perfectly happy,'' if that were to happen, Livingston said 
during a news conference his Republican colleague Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott. Livingston said it is too early to make any decision 
on whether the House should consider censuring President Bill Clinton 
as an alternative to impeachment.
