When a young Romanian man was jilted days before his wedding, his 
parents came up with a novel solution _ they rented a bride. Determined 
to save their 22-year-old son's honor and not lose the money they 
had spent on the nuptials, the family also rented ``parents'' for 
the ``bride,'' the daily Evenimentul Zilei reported. A childhood friend 
named Mariana stepped in, feeling sorry for Lucian. The newspaper 
gave no family names. For days, the actors rehearsed lines and practiced 
the wedding ceremony. Lucian's family agreed that the ``bride'' would 
receive 1 million lei (dlrs 100) for her trouble. In Romania, wedding 
guests give money to help cover the costs. If the wedding had been 
canceled, the family would have lost all the millions of lei (hundreds 
of dollars) it had spent. Things got off to a bad start at the wedding 
in Bacau, some 250 kilometers (156 miles) northeast of Bucharest last 
weekend. The priest who presided wished the couple ``a house of stone 
and many children'' in traditional Orthodox fashion. But only two-thirds 
of the invited guests showed up, and some guests who seemed surprised 
by the new bride, weren't as generous as expected. Mariana only received 
lei 32,000 (dlrs 3.20) because the takings were so small and she has 
another headache _ apparently Lucian has fallen for her and wants 
the marriage to last.
