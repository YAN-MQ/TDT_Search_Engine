The Palestinians and the United States have rejected new conditions 
set by Israel before it will withdraw from more West Bank land as 
agreed in the Wye River accord. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
says, if the Palestinians want the agreement implemented, they must 
end talk of declaring statehood and... They must stop the fomenting 
of violence, the lynch mobs that we saw yesterday. They must recognize 
that we did not agree to release terrorist murderers in Wye and say 
it to their own people. The U.S. State Department says the accord 
should be implemented as signed.
