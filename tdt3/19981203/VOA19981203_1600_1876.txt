The Human Rights Watch annual report has harsh words for the Clinton 
administration for not supporting several human rights initiatives, 
including the International Court of Justice and an anti-land mine 
treaty. The report noted improvement in the former Soviet Union, Latin 
America, South Africa, and parts of Asia. Although serious problems 
persist, human rights executive director Kenneth Roth says there has 
been a transformation in the way governments are expected to treat 
their people. All but the most repressive governments today allow 
human rights groups to exist within their countries, and these groups 
represent citizens who insist on holding governments accountable.
