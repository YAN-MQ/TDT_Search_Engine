Ukraine's parliament on Thursday postponed debate over the 1999 budget 
draft after criticizing many of its figures as unrealistic. Deputies 
in the 450-seat legislature overwhelmingly voted 312-10 to put off 
the first reading of the document until Dec. 9 to let parliament's 
budget committee revise it. The draft, presented to lawmakers on Wednesday, 
provided for a zero deficit and sharply raised the central government's 
projected revenues and expenditures to nearly 50 percent more than 
the Cabinet had initially proposed. The revenues and expenditures 
were set at 35.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 10.2 billion). The budget draft 
must pass three readings in parliament before final approval. But 
Thursday's postponement and widespread dissatisfaction with the proposed 
document have led many analysts to predict that the budget has little 
chance of approval before the end of the year. Cabinet officials objected 
to the draft Wednesday, an amended version of what the government 
had submitted last month. Many lawmakers echoed the Cabinet's criticism 
Thursday, calling the budget's revenue target impossible to meet and 
questioning several unorthodox sources proposed for filling government 
coffers. The budget committee has proposed, for instance, raising 
extra money by taxing commercial banks, extracting payment for using 
Ukraine's air space and pushing enterprises to repay loans received 
under government guarantees. The legislators also cast doubt on the 
budget draft and its optimistic tax projections after noting the government's 
extremely poor tax collection so far this year. Budget revenues in 
the first nine months of 1998 were just 50.8 percent of the annual 
target, while companies' tax debts skyrocketed to 9.2 billion hryvna 
(dlrs 2.68 billion) as of Nov. 1.
