Sexual details in the Monica Lewinsky matter have led a Florida school 
board to keep the subject out of the classroom. But one high school 
teacher is taking it to court. Charles belcher reports. Linda Manning 
has been teaching for 26 years now. She feels she has the judgment 
to decide what's appropriate for students. At least lake high school, 
she wanted to use the Starr report as a teaching tool in her senior 
government class. It's not to titillate, to include the details, it's 
to understand what is the alleged perjury about. The school system 
didn't mind impeachment proceedings being taught or discussion of 
the Starr report, but they didn't want to report used in its entirety. 
The only concern we had was in the tapes themselves there's some very 
graphic and sexually explicit portions of that tape. Manning refused 
to let anyone censor the report and decided to file a federal injunction 
against the school system claiming her freedom of speech and teacher's 
rights were being violated. I love the constitution, I have too much 
respect for it to let it be diminished or to let some of my professional 
self-esteem take a hit without saying, I think that this is questionable. 
Teachers should not lose their freedom of expression. First amendment 
rights. When they take on the challenging job of being an educator. 
I think it really boils down to the board's right to restrict sexually 
explicit types of information in the classroom. The teachers' union 
is backing Manning 100% and paying her legal fees. She's the professional 
who is licensed to make decisions as to what's appropriate in that 
court at that time. Not the school board attorney, not the superintendent. 
The class we're talking about here is a college prep course for seniors. 
Manning sent home permission slips with students to let the parents 
know she was interested in using the Starr report in class. If a parent 
wanted to object, they'd have the chance to. Instead, the objection 
came from the school system. We're trying to enforce a community standard 
of morality that for anybody, including adults, some of that testimony 
may be very offensive. You can't segregate what piece of it is appropriate 
or inappropriate. So as the legal battle rages on in Washington, now 
another legal battle brews, this one closer to home. Charley belcher,
