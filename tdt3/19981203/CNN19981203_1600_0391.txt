U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan is hoping to convince Libya to hand 
over two suspects wanted in the bombing of pan-am flight 103. Annan 
says he'll discuss the matter when he meets with Libyan leader moammar 
Gadhafi over the weekend. Flight 103 crashed over Lockerbie, Scotland, 
11 years ago this month, killing 270 people. The two suspects, both 
Libyan, are accused of planting a bomb on the plane. If extradited, 
they would likely be tried in the Netherlands.
