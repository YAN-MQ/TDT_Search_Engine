And finally, we recently aired a report about Gro Ing na. It's Taiwanese 
aboriginal singer did not get credit when a pop group sampled his 
music and he's the case to court. Our story prompted an e-mail from 
Jason Gilbreadth. He said he recently bought a CD by the group Deep 
Forest, which is dedicated the preservation of pygmy peoples in Africa. 
Mr. Gilbreadth's wife recognized one of the songs on the CD. He writes, 
" she was outraged the song 'Sweet Lullaby', which her grandmother 
sang to her when she was child". Mr. Gilbreadth's wife grew up in 
the Salomon Islands, half a world away from Africa. And the true origins 
of the songs, she says, are no where to be found on the album.
