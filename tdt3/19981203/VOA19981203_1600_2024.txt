The incoming speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives is withholding 
judgment about whether lawmakers might vote to censure President Clinton 
instead of impeaching him. VOA's David Swan has our report. A number 
of moderate Republicans suggest the House should censure the president 
over his affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky. The proposal calls 
for Mr. Clinton to admit wrongdoing, pay a financial penalty, and 
stay in office, but newly elected speaker Bob Livingston declines 
to say if he will let the measure reach the House floor. He tells 
reporters he first wants to hear from the Judiciary Committee which 
is weighing impeachment. I'm not going to make any decisions about 
procedure until we see the report and have a chance to digest it and 
understand exactly what Henry Hyde and the Judiciary Committee recommended. 
Chairman Hyde and other committee Republicans are expected to call 
for impeachment on perjury and perhaps other grounds. However, congressional 
sources say they do not plan to pursue charges of corrupt fund-raising 
in the 1996 election campaign. David Swan, VOA News, Capitol Hill.
