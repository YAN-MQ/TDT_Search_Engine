The new president of Britain's governing body of track and field expressed 
reservations Thursday about a German proposal to scrap all existing 
world records because many are tainted by suspicions of drug use. 
David Hemery, elected the first president of UK Athletics two weeks 
ago, is flying to Frankfurt on Friday for a meeting of the European 
Athletic Association. Hemery, former Olympic champion and world record-holder 
in the 400 meter hurdles, said he wants to talks with his German counterpart 
about his proposal to start afresh with a new world record list in 
2000. Digel, president of the German federation (DLV), believes the 
shadow of drugs hangs over long-standing records _ some set during 
the 1980s at a time of systematic doping in Eastern Bloc countries. 
Digel wants the world governing body, the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, to vote on the proposal at its congress next August before 
the world championships in Seville, Spain. But Hemery, who advocates 
tough anti-doping measures, believes Digel's plan may be off the mark. 
``I am open minded and want to listen to the proposals, but the caution 
I have is that it almost implies every record is tainted before that 
date,'' Hemery was quoted as saying in The Times. ``That, for me, 
would be unjust. A second implication is that by 2000 we would have 
in place absolute certainty that everything from then on was clean. 
That, also, is unrealistic. ... ``We can not hold up our hands and 
say, after the clean-sheet start, that records are undoubtedly going 
to be clean.'' Digel's proposal has also failed to win the support 
of IAAF president Primo Nebiolo. ``This is a fascinating idea but 
I don't think it's realistic,'' Nebiolo said in an interview with 
The Associated Press last month. ``How can you tell Michael Johnson 
you are canceling his world record of 19.32 seconds in the 200? How 
can you do this?''
