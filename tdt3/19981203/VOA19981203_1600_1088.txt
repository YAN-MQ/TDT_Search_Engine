First, let's get an update on the top news in sports from Steve Shine. 
Thank you very much, Erin. U.S. swimmer Jenny Thompson broke two butterfly 
world records in two days at a world cup short-course swim meet in 
College Station, Texas. The 25-year-old, five-time Olympic gold medalist 
broke the 50-meter butterfly Wednesday in a preliminary heat in the 
25-meter pool. Her time was 26.05 seconds. That was.43 second faster 
than the old mark set last year. On Tuesday, Thompson bettered the 
record in the 100-meter butterfly. Also at the meet Wednesday night, 
American Gary Hall returned from a suspension to win the men's 50-meter 
freestyle. He beat number-one ranked Fernando Shearer of Brazil. Hall, 
a double gold and silver medalist at the Olympics two years ago, served 
a six-month suspension for testing positive for marijuana.
