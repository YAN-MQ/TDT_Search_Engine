A Warsaw military court issued an arrest warrant Thursday for an elderly 
communist-era prosecutor, the first step toward extraditing her from 
England. The Warsaw Military District Court accepted a military prosecutor's 
motion for the arrest warrant for Helena Wolinska, 79, who now lives 
in Oxford. Wolinska is accused of being responsible for the arrest 
and subsequent execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf, a World War II resistance 
hero, on allegedly fabricated evidence. She called the move to arrest 
her ``a political case'' but refused to discuss the allegations Thursday, 
the PAP state news agency reported. Last week, Wolinska said she feared 
she would not get a fair trial in Poland. The military court ruled 
Thursday the allegations against Wolinska were justified. It ordered 
the arrest warrant on the assumption that Wolinska would try to avoid 
coming to Poland for an investigation of Fieldorf's death. Wolinska 
had been summoned to testify at the investigation on Oct. 15, but 
she failed to show up, prompting the military prosecutor to seek the 
arrest warrant. The arrest warrant allows the government to prepare 
an extradition motion. Wolinska, who is married to Wlodzimierz Brus, 
emeritus professor of modern Russian and East European studies at 
Oxford University, has lived in Britain since 1972. Fieldorf, known 
by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground Home Army that fought 
the Nazis during World War II. After the war, he refused to collaborate 
with the secret service of the new communist regime. He was charged 
in 1952 with killing Soviet soldiers and leftist resisters during 
the war, and was hanged in 1953. Historians say Wolinska fabricated 
the charges. If convicted of denying Fieldorf his freedom, Wolinska 
could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.
