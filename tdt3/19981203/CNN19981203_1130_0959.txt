European central bankers make a bold move to energize their economies. 
I'm Myron Kandel at the "CNN Financial News" in New York with this 
edition of "Dollars & Sense." France and Germany led ten nags in a 
coordinated interest rate cut. The move surprised investors, and comes

central bank said the cut was intended to spur economic growth. He 
also said some nations will probably need to cut further.
