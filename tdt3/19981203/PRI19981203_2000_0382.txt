This is The World. I'm Lisa Mullins. On the same a Palestinian was 
stabbed to death by a man police say maybe a Jewish serial killer, 
this scene broadcast on television hit Israeli citizens with a harder 
punch. It shows a Palestinian mob attacking an Israeli soldiers car. 
The Palestinian dragged the man from his vehicle and beat him. Although 
the soldier escaped with minor injuries, the incident had immediate 
repercussions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu halted further 
troop withdrawals from the West Bank unless the Palestinian authority 
abandons plans to declare an independent state in May. The Palestinians' 
chief negotiator Seri Baracot rejected the condition declaring it 
a violation of the Wye Peace Accord signed in October. This trend 
by the Israeli government is not. The continuation of trying to add 
or to omit part of the Wye will not be acceptable. We have said so 
many times and we will say it again that we will honor our commitments 
pertaining from the Wye to the letter and we urge the Israeli government 
to the same. Seri Baracot's positions was echoed in Washington by 
Allan Miller, the deputy to the US envoy. It's our view that the Wye 
River Memorandum should be implemented as signed. It's simply not 
appropriate to add new or additional conditions. The pursuers really 
Palestinian peace is an extremely difficult problem. Both sides have 
needs and requirements to which they tenaciously adhere. And this 
process has long been beset with many problems and challenges. Today, 
Prime Minister Netanyahu shrugged off Washington's rejection of his 
demands, reiterating his insistence that the Palestinian authorities 
stop inciting its people to commit violence against Israelis. I cannot 
allow myself to see Israeli citizens being lynched or about to be 
lynched by a crazed mob that was received incitement from Palestinian 
officials. One of Arafat's chief deputies the day before said we've 
got release of the prisoners by using rocks. Using rocks against whom? 
Our people. As the rhetorical heat rose, stone-throwing Palestinian 
demonstrators today clashed with Israeli forces in Arab East Jerusalem. 
Police arrested 19 demonstrators.
