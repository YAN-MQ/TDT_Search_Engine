The leader of the Republican Party in Suffolk County was arrested 
Thursday and charged with taking bribes from a private carter for 
access to a public landfill in Brookhaven and with conspiring to traffic 
in stolen trucks. The leader, John Powell, a former heavy-equipment 
operator for the Brookhaven Highway Department, had a rapid rise to 
political power in Suffolk County that culminated in 1995, when he 
took charge of the county Republican organization. He had been frequently 
mentioned as a candidate to head the Republican State Committee, in 
part because of his early support for Gov. George Pataki and his success 
in delivering votes for him on Long Island. Powell, 38, was among 
19 people charged here in what federal prosecutors said was a group 
of interlocking criminal schemes that included operating ``chop shops'' 
_ in which stolen trucks were taken apart to be sold for their parts 
or to be rebuilt and resold _ and extortion at the landfill, as well 
as arson, obstruction of justice and the sale of narcotics. The stolen-truck 
operations were conducted from various businesses in the county, including 
a horse farm in Manorville and a truck repair company in East Patchogue, 
according to the criminal complaint. The repair company was located 
across the street from a trucking company, GP Tech, which prosecutors 
said was nominally owned by Powell's brother, George, but which Powell 
is said to have controlled. The complaint quotes government witnesses 
as saying that Powell was aware that the East Patchogue company, owned 
by Joseph Provenzano, was a chop shop. They say Powell was the ``driving 
force'' behind GP Tech's purchase of trucks from Provenzano. In a 
conversation secretly recorded in January, prosecutors said, Powell 
discussed his desire to have the town of Brookhaven buy one of GP 
Tech's trucks. Powell, who began his political career stuffing envelopes 
and answering phones at the Brookhaven Republican Committee, and has 
run that committee since 1991, has shown signs of imperiousness in 
recent years, once boasting, ``I am Brookhaven.'' But court documents 
contend that he tried to cash in on his political power. Much of the 
prosecution's case involves allegations of bribes made at the town 
landfill, where government witnesses described widespread corruption, 
and centers on Joseph Lapienski, the official in charge of the dump. 
Lapienski, who is accused of extorting thousands from one unidentified 
Suffolk hauling company in return for access to the landfill, referred 
to Powell as ``his boss,'' prosecutors said. Powell, who referred 
to the town dump as ``my landfill'' in one intercepted conversation, 
prosecutors say, is accused of accepting $20,000 over a 10-month period 
from the same hauling company. Prosecutors said Powell suggested to 
an executive of the company, who became a government witness, that 
the two ``become equal partners'' on a new truck that would haul material 
to the landfill. But prosecutors said Powell contributed nothing and 
expected $2,000 in cash each month. Prosecutors said that in May, 
when a search warrant was being executed at Provenzano's East Patchogue 
truck yard, Powell lingered at the scene, berating agents from the 
FBI and describing the seizure of two GP Tech trucks there as ``a 
personal attack'' on him and his brother. Yet the following month, 
a year after the authorities had begun their investigation, Provenzano 
was recorded telling a cooperating witness how to continue making 
the cash payoffs to Powell without being spotted by law enforcement 
agents, prosecutors said. Leaving the federal courthouse here Thursday, 
Powell referred to the government's case as ``a joke'' but declined 
to comment further. His lawyer, Raymond Perini, vowed that Powell 
would be ``completely vindicated'' and said he would push for a speedy 
trial. ``I've never seen such a weak, thin complaint,'' Perini said. 
``They're accusing the county leader of stripping trucks? It's ridiculous.'' 
Powell was released on $100,000 bail, secured by his house in Medford. 
Powell will continue as party chairman ``into the foreseeable future,'' 
officials of the Suffolk Republican Committee said in a statement.
