A fire raged through a Manila orphanage earlier today killing at least 
28 people, most of them were babies. The youngsters were awakened 
from sleep by choking smoke and flames. Ruth Youngblood reports on 
the tragedy from the Philippines capital. Firemen sifting through 
the smoldering ruins said they are searching for missing victims from 
the tragedy at the Bahai Calingo Orphanage. At least 70 people were 
inside the 80-year-old orphanage and children's home in Manila's Paco 
section when the fire broke out at a.m. local time. Employees who 
managed to escape the inferno said some youngsters were trapped behind 
locked exit doors in the three-story wooden structure. Workers said 
they heard the cries but did not reach many of the youngsters because 
the flames spread so quickly. A sobbing worker said the children had 
been in particularly best of spirits looking forward to a Christmas 
party this week. The rescued children and babies were initially brought 
to a nearby Catholic school and then whisked by ambulances to a Department 
of Social Welfare Center providing temporary accommodations. The shaken 
victims, some only a few months old, were bare foot and wearing their 
sleeping garments. Manila Mayor Ledo Arienca said the fire initially 
blamed on a short circuit was an enormous tragedy. At the height of 
the blaze, the trapped youngsters scrambled from their beds and were 
heard screaming from windows. The orphanage is run by nongovernment 
organizations for offspring abandoned by their mothers. Although the 
building is near a fire station, their report took an hour before 
the first trucks arrived at the scene. Mayor Arienca said he is ordering 
an investigation into the delay. The tragedy was one of the worst 
fires in Philippine history. In March 1996, 160 people died in a Manila 
deaf school, many of them youngsters celebrating their school graduations.
