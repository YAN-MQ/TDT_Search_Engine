A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday night approved a $25 million 
loan for Livent Inc., the Broadway theater company that has been crippled 
by a financial scandal, after the lender agreed to lower the interest 
rate. The ruling by Judge Arthur Gonzalez relieved, at least temporarily, 
an acute financial squeeze on Livent, which had warned that without 
more cash by Friday it would close its doors on Monday. Livent is 
the producer of ``Ragtime'' on Broadway as well as other shows now 
in New York, Chicago and Toronto. Gonzalez's decision came after a 
lengthy hearing in his Manhattan courtroom over whether the proposed 
lender _ Angelo, Gordon &AMP; Co., a New York investment firm _ might 
have a conflict of interest and be charging too much for the loan. 
A group of Livent creditors and bondholders had rejected the loan 
from Angelo, Gordon, saying they were concerned that the firm might 
have ties to companies interested in buying Livent or its theaters. 
They also said they had found another lender willing to lend Livent 
the money at less cost. Lawyers for the creditors and bondholders 
did not mention any names of companies with which Angelo, Gordon might 
have a tie. But Angelo, Gordon was founded by John Angelo, a friend 
of Michael Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney Co. Disney is among 
several companies that have been mentioned as possible buyers of Livent, 
its theaters or other assets. But Robert Webster, an executive vice-president 
at Livent, told the court he did not believe that Angelo, Gordon had 
an outside ``agenda'' in offering the company the loan. ``I believe 
they are approaching this from purely a lending perspective,'' Webster 
said. And Adam Harris, a lawyer for Angelo, Gordon, said that the 
firm had no agreement with any third party that might be interested 
in Livent. At the four-hour hearing attended by at least two dozen 
lawyers, Webster said that the company would close its doors on Monday 
and begin selling all its property if it did not get $13 million by 
Friday. ``We don't have enough money to run the shows or run the business,'' 
he said. ``We will begin to liquidate the company on Monday morning.'' 
The creditors said that they had found another lender, Farallon Capital 
Management, a California investment firm, willing to lend Livent the 
money immediately at an interest rate of 12 percent. But after negotiations 
behind closed doors, Angelo, Gordon agreed to lower the interest rate 
on its loan to 13.5 percent from 14.5 percent. The creditors and bondholders 
then withdrew their objections. It was unclear why they did not press 
for an even lower rate. Webster said the loan would carry the company 
to June or July. The company is now trying to reorganize its finances. 
This week, Livent laid off hundreds of full-time and part-time employees, 
and said that it planned to cut its administrative costs by 40 percent. 
On Nov. 18, Livent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection 
from its creditors. That move came just six months after Michael Ovitz, 
the former president of Walt Disney, took over the company. Ovitz 
and the company's other new managers have blamed the company's financial 
problems on its founders, Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb. The 
new managers say the two men engaged in a widespread financial fraud 
and manipulated the accounting ledgers to hide millions of dollars 
in losses from the company's musicals. Drabinsky and Gottlieb have 
denied all wrongdoing. Angelo, Gordon, a private firm, focuses on 
investing in financially troubled companies. The firm was created 
in 1988 by Angelo and Michael Gordon, who had headed the arbitrage 
department at L.F. Rothschild &AMP; Co.
