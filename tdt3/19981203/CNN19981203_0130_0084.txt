Former agriculture secretary Mike Espy has been acquitted in a corruption 
case, which forced him to leave office. Jonathan Karl has more on 
the verdict and reaction to it. Four years after he lost his cabinet 
post under a cloud of scandal, Mike Espy won sweet vindication -- 
30 counts of not guilty. It's cost a lot, it's been tough. But I knew 
from day one that I would stand here before you completely exonerated. 
The case against Espy centered on more than $30,000 in gifts he received 
from companies that he was responsible for regulating. The companies, 
including Tyson foods, sun diamond and quaker oats treated espy to 
tickets for top sports events like the U.S. open tennis tournament 
and paid for Espy's then-girlfriend to travel with him on an official 
trip to Greece. Mike Espy was acquitted because the prosecutor did 
not have any evidence of guilt. And the reason there was no evidence 
was because Mike Espy had not engaged in any criminal conduct. Independent 
counsel Donald smaltz spent more than $17 million and four years prosecuting 
Espy. If our investigation and prosecutions dissuade corporations 
from giving gifts to their regulators and the regulators from accepting 
gifts from those who are regulated, I believe the costs we have incurred 
are worth the price. Smaltz does not leave empty-handed, though. He 
won 15 related convictions and $11 million in fines from the companies 
who gave Espy the gifts. Espy's lawyers, though, said the case was 
an example of what is wrong with the independent counsel statute. 
It is time for serious-minded, reasonable and decent people on both 
sides of the aisle to put this insanity to rest. The jury forewoman 
slowly read each of the not-guilty verdicts. When she reached the 
last one, she paused, looked at Espy, smiled and said, "Not guilty."
