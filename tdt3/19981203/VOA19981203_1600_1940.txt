The Palestinians and the United States have rejected new conditions 
set by Israel before it will withdraw from more West Bank land as 
agreed in the Wye River accord. VOA's David Gullus has more from Jerusalem. 
Israel made the demands after a series of incidents, including an 
attack on two motorists in the West Bank that was filmed and shown 
on Israeli television. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel 
will not make its next redeployment unless the Palestinians halt incitement, 
stop threatening to declare statehood, and stop accusing Israel of 
violating the Wye River accords with its prisoner release last month. 
Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi told VOA the Palestinians will not comply. 
These conditions are violations of the Wye River memorandum. They 
are rejected totally by us. They were rejected by the State Department, 
and we think that the government of Israel is seeking excuses in order 
not to implement the agreement. Mr. Tibi called on U.S. diplomats 
to intervene. David Gullus, VOA News, Jerusalem.
