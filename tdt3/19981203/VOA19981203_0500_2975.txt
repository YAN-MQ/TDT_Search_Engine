Stock prices were lower in Tokyo with the Nikkei Index dropping two 
percent in a host of bearish factors, including an overnight drop 
from the U.S. Stock Market and a report that Japan's economy contracted 
7/10ths of a percent on the July to September quarter. Elsewhere in 
Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was basically flat, finishing off 
a fraction of a percentage point. Shares were sharply lower in Manila, 
slightly lower in Wellington, Taipei, and Sydney, but they were mixed 
in Seoul.
