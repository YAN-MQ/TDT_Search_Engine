Today's scheduled launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavour with the component 
of the International Space Station on board has been postponed. We're 
progress. We have had to cut off the countdown. We did not pick up 
the countdown in time to meet our launch window. Cut off all. Proceed 
to the recycle control sequence, sequence 18. Again, we have stopped 
the countdown clock at T-minus 19 seconds. We were not able to pick 
up the count in time to meet the very end of our launch window. The 
launch was called off seconds before lift off because engineers could 
not find the cause of an equipment alarm. Problems during the countdown 
delayed the launch past a narrow window. The shuttle wants to rendezvous 
with a Russian-made module of the space station already in orbit. 
U.S. space agency officials say another launch attempt will not be 
made for at least 24 hours.
