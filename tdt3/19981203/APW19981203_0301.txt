Shares fell slightly Thursday, with a strong rebound by property stocks 
staving off a heftier drop. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index slipped 
9.63 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 10,046.15. A smaller index 
tracking Hong Kong real estate companies dropped as much as 3 percent 
in early trading but then bounced back to show a gain of 2.5 percent. 
On Wednesday, the Hang Seng had risen 0.8 percent after plunging 7.5 
percent in the previous three sessions. The sharp turnaround by property 
companies late Thursday was triggered by news that the Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority _ the territory's de facto central bank _ will raise the 
ceiling on mortgage lending to 85 percent of the purchase price from 
70 percent. That prompted some investors who had sold off real estate 
stocks to buy them back, said Andrew To, sales director at Tai Fook 
Securities Co. Market turnover rose as investors cashed in on early 
gains, hitting 5.61 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 719 million), 
compared with Wednesday's 4.54 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 
582 million). Property giants led the gainers, with Henderson Land 
rising 1.10 to close at 38.90 and Sun Hung Kai Properties rising 1.75 
to close at 56.50. Hang Seng Bank was up 1.00 to close at 66.25. Market 
heavyweight HSBC Holdings led the losers, falling 2.50 to close at 
186.50. Hong Kong Electric also fell 0.65 to close at 25.00, while 
China Telecom fell 0.60 to close at 25.00. Hong Kong's flag carrier 
Cathay Pacific remained unchanged at 7.65, while conglomerate Swire 
Pacific ``A'' rose 0.60 to close at 35.30.
