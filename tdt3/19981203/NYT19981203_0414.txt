The late autumn rally has erased much of the stock market's summer 
declines. But stock investors may have little to cheer about for the 
rest of the year. Witness the market reaction Thursday to a surprise 
cut in short-term interest rates across Europe _ a resoundingly positive 
development that should stimulate the economies of some of America's 
biggest trading partners. Rather than extending the glee evinced by 
European markets, Americans shrugged it off. They turned their attention 
south to Brazil, where the government's failure to gain approval for 
a fiscal austerity measure sent Brazilian stocks plunging nearly 9 
percent. The specter of yet another emerging market crisis fueled 
a 2 percent decline in major American stock indexes and nudged some 
investors back to the safety of U.S. Treasury securities. The yield 
on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell back to near 5 percent 
for the first time in six weeks. Uncertainty about Brazil and several 
other factors could keep stock prices under pressure for the next 
few weeks, financial analysts say. After regaining nearly all of the 
ground they lost in July and August, and coming within spitting distance 
of new highs, the major stock-market indexes are due for a pause. 
Add nervousness about the recovery of emerging markets, concern over 
fourth-quarter profits and the inevitable round of year-end tax-related 
selling, and many investors might opt to preserve their gains for 
the year. But the same financial advisers say they are optimistic 
that, barring a Brazilian disaster, investors will start the new year 
confident that the stock market continues to hold the greatest potential 
for long-term financial gains, sending a fresh wave of money into 
stocks. ``Even though we'll continue to get some of these periodic 
scares, I think we're building a very positive case for financial 
assets,'' said Robert Bissell, president of Wells Capital Management, 
a unit of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. Given the gyrations in stock prices 
during the second half of this year, a few weeks of sideways movement 
might not be a bad thing. And in the longer term, many investment 
professionals remain upbeat on the outlook for stocks. ``In the longer 
term, the European rate cut is a very positive signal to the marketplace,'' 
said John Kim, chief investment officer at Aeltus Investment Management, 
Aetna Inc.'s money-management division. ``But questions continue to 
linger on about what happens in the emerging economies. There, I think 
the road will be pretty bumpy, at least in the near term.'' In the 
United States, the economy has continued to exhibit slow and steady 
growth. That gives Kim and others confidence that American companies 
will report reasonably strong growth in corporate profits for the 
fourth quarter. ``Certainly, we're not going to see the bottom fall 
out of earnings in the fourth quarter,'' as many had feared when they 
pondered the effect of the Asian slowdown, said George Cohen, a principal 
at Cohen Klingenstein &AMP; Marks, a New York money management firm. 
``I think earnings will be all right.'' Of course, companies whose 
businesses are closely linked to Asia, like Boeing Co., could continue 
to experience problems. Others, like Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., are 
apparently suffering from problems specific to their businesses, Cohen 
said. ``But companies like Cisco Systems, which we own, have so much 
demand that they can't deliver products fast enough to meet demand,'' 
Cohen said. ``Companies like that are not affected by the problems 
in Asia.'' Indeed, the Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology 
stocks, has risen twice as much as the Dow Jones industrial average 
since the beginning of the year. The Nasdaq index finished Thursday 
at about 1,954, up 24.5 percent since Jan. 1. That compares with a 
12.3 percent gain for the Dow industrials, which ended Thursday at 
8,879. And the Nasdaq 100 index, of the 100 largest Nasdaq stocks, 
has gained 59 percent this year. Among the top 15 stocks in the index, 
which account for 75 percent of its capitalization, only one _ Amgen 
Inc., the biotechnology company _ operates outside the electronic 
technology or telecommunications industries. Some economists, like 
Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, are 
more cautious about the outlook for corporate profits. The events 
in Brazil, he said, are a setback. And even though Thursday's interest 
rate cuts by European central bankers are ``great news for investors 
around the world,'' he said, it will not be until late 1999 or 2000 
that the effect of those cuts will work its way through to corporate 
earnings. ``It's a bit too early to bring out the trumpets,'' Chan 
said. ``But I think these moves today will have a positive impact 
on corporate profits.''
