Cambodia's decision on whom to send to the ASEAN summit in Hanoi this 
month will depend on whether it is admitted to the group in advance, 
the country's ambassador to Vietnam said Thursday. Nuon Sareth called 
Cambodia's status as an observer at Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations summits ``outdated.'' ASEAN's nine members have been hesitant 
to approve Cambodia's application until the country has a stable government. 
After months of political stalemate, Cambodia formed a new coalition 
government on Monday. ``Cambodian admission to ASEAN is a complicated 
issue because some countries are in favor, some are not because they 
want more stability in Cambodia,'' Sareth said by telephone. ``The 
maintenance of Cambodia's observer status for too long is outdated, 
and Cambodia will consider who to send to the summit, depending on 
whether it is admitted or not.'' Vietnam reportedly has been spearheading 
an effort to gain Cambodia's admission before the Dec. 15-16 summit. 
ASEAN standing committee chairman S. Jayakumar, Singapore's foreign 
minister, has effectively ruled out Cambodia's entry to the group 
before the summit but said he will consult with regional foreign ministers 
on the issue.
