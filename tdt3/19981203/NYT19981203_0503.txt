Mike Espy recalls in detail the grim mood of the White House four 
years ago when, with a corruption inquiry looming, he was forced to 
walk the political plank as secretary of agriculture with, he says, 
a farewell handshake and a firm promise from President Clinton. ``The 
Clinton poll numbers were tanking and Whitewater had just begun and 
they did not need any more trouble,'' Espy said Thursday, recalling 
his forced resignation even as he awaited word from the president 
to see whether Clinton might bring up that promise. ``Whatever he 
wants to talk about,'' said Espy, who, a day after his acquittal in 
an independent counsel prosecution, carefully declined to discuss 
the president's words. ``I'm sure we'll converse shortly.'' White 
House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, dampened speculation 
that the president, now caught in the impeachment ordeal, might soon 
deliver on any four-year-old hope Espy harbors for reappointment to 
government. Clinton hailed the acquittal as heartening and expressed 
hope Espy could in some fashion continue his service to the country. 
In defeating a 30-count indictment brought after a four-year, $17 
million inquiry, Espy was celebrating a major setback for the independent 
counsel law and for Donald Smaltz, the prosecutor who failed to convict 
him of breaking the law in accepting sports tickets and favors from 
companies his agency regulated. ``I think he's a bit of a megalomaniac,'' 
Espy said of Smaltz, whom the Espy defense team criticized in particular 
for having contended after the acquittal that ``the actual indictment 
of a public official may in fact be as great a deterrent as a conviction'' 
of that official. ``It's Kafkaesque,'' said Ted Wells, an Espy defense 
lawyer. ``Why not just randomly execute a few innocent people?'' he 
asked, complaining that Smaltz, Kenneth Starr and other independent 
counsels have unlimited time, resources and zeal once an official 
has become the focus of an inquiry and the prosecutors' reputations 
are on the line. ``It is inevitable that it will become a witch hunt.'' 
Smaltz was not available for comment but William Noakes Jr., his associate 
counsel and spokesman, said it was inaccurate to interpret Smaltz's 
comment to mean that he brought the indictment to make an example 
without concern for whether Espy would be convicted. ``I don't think 
he was saying in the abstract that the indictment was going to send 
a message,'' he said. ``But when you have an indictment and there 
are facts that come out in a trial over eights weeks, that does send 
a message.'' Other lawyers criticized the remark as graceless and 
morally wrong, but Espy's other defense lawyer, Reid Weingarten, conceded 
there probably was no ethical violation in a losing prosecutor's claiming 
to find virtue in his failed indictment. Weingarten said the Espy 
prosecution was so sweeping and single-minded that he had been unable 
to approach the independent counsel in the informal but crucial way 
defense lawyers often point to weaknesses in a prosecutor's case before 
going to trial. In a typical Justice Department prosecution, he said, 
professionals would have ordered the Espy inquiry closed after six 
months for lack of strong evidence. ``I'm probably more certifiably 
clean than anybody in the city,'' Espy declared in an interview at 
his lawyers' office. ``I've been looked at from head to toe,'' he 
said, from tax statements to home mortgage applications, personal 
diaries included. He said he had greater strength after the four-year 
ordeal in which he relied on the Bible and martial arts for spiritual 
comfort. But he listed a variety of damaging effects, too. Espy said 
that Michelle Matlock, his twin sister, is now burdened with extensive 
legal bills because she had been summoned to testify about him. Untrue 
rumors of a hidden business deal were enough to block a bank loan 
for an old friend and respected farmer back home in Yazoo City, Miss., 
he added. But at least the trial led him to discover who his real 
friends were, Espy said. ``Very few in this town,'' he declared. Yet 
he is considering opening a law office in Washington, among other 
options for repairing his career. ``Never say never,'' he added to 
the question about whether he might consider a possible run for Mississippi 
governor or other office. ``Adversity can be a boon to you even perhaps 
politically,'' he said, as ``somebody who beat City Hall.'' Espy said 
he fervidly wanted to testify at his trial but his defense team had 
him sit mute because of the government's weak case. Smaltz's tally 
of more than $30,000 in reported gift-taking was a ``sham figure,' 
Espy said, insisting the amount of questionable gifts actually totaled 
no more than $200. Of skybox sports tickets he accepted from one agricultural 
corporation, Espy said that government business was not discussed 
and the jury found it not to be a crime. In retrospect, he admitted, 
``I probably shouldn't have been there.'' He conceded, ``I am guilty 
of being inattentive and in some cases stupid.'' Espy would not discuss 
his legal costs from the four-year struggle, which are not reimbursable 
under the independent counsel law. Officials under investigation who 
are cleared short of indictment do get reimbursement. ``I'm not bitter,'' 
he said. ``I want to teach ethics classes in Mississippi _ I think 
I'm an expert now,'' he said, grinning. Weingarten countered, ``No, 
in D.C., in Washington.''
