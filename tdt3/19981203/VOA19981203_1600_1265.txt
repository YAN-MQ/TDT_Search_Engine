In the most radical change to English county cricket in its more than 
100-year history, the 18 teams have voted to introduce a two-division 
championship in 2000. The proposal, which was rejected last year, 
was approved Thursday by the first-class forum. There was only one 
vote against the proposal. The new system is designed to make England 
more competitive on an international level. Under the plan, there 
will be two divisions of nine teams each. With the soccer-style system 
of promotion and relegation, the top nine teams in next year's championship 
will play in the top tier division in 2000, with the remainder in 
the lower tier. Each county team will play the other eight teams in 
its divisions on a home and away basis in 16 four-day matches. Three 
teams will be promoted, and three will be relegated.
