Labor unrest mounted across France on Thursday, with rail workers 
still on strike, jobless protesters holding sit-ins to demand a year-end 
bonus and school monitors walking off the job. The rail strike, which 
began last Friday, hit most of the country's 23 regions, with services 
severely disrupted. The strike was set to continue Friday. Rail workers 
say there is insufficient staff to counter growing crime on trains 
and worry about how the government will implement a plan to cut the 
working week from 39 to 35 hours. Many workers fear a 35-hour week, 
aimed at spreading jobs around and cutting unemployment, will lead 
to salary cuts. Staff say a lack of employees has created a safety 
problem for workers and travelers. The SNCF plans to hold a national 
meeting next week to address train workers' concerns. A spate of physical 
attacks on transit workers has sparked several strikes in recent months, 
and ticket-sellers in the southwest city of Lyon walked off the job 
Thursday after a colleague was held at gunpoint during a holdup. Elsewhere, 
in the town of Canabiere, near Marseille in southern France, police 
said 10,000 jobless protesters took to the streets to demand a 3,000 
franc (dlrs 526) year-end bonus. Organizers said there were up to 
20,000 people at the rally. ``This is unprecedented,'' said Charles 
Hoareau, an official of the CGT union grouping. The protesters marched 
to police headquarters in Bouches-du-Rhone where they were joined 
by several hundred striking postal workers who are demanding a shorter 
working week and more staff. Guy Hermier, a Communist Party deputy 
for Bouches-du-Rhone, said the plea for a year-end payment was justified. 
``This bonus would allow thousands of workers who have no jobs to 
spend the New Year in decent conditions,'' he said. In Lille, northern 
France, about 60 unemployed protesters occupied government labor offices 
to demand more jobs and higher benefits. About half of the school 
monitors in junior high schools and high schools stayed off the job 
Thursday to protest reforms that they say downgrades the status of 
their work.
