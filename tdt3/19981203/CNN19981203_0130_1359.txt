Notebook computers are traveling lighter with built-in superdisk drives. 
Only the superdisk drive works with both regular floppies and 120mb 
superdisk diskettes. Floppies everywhere are thrilled because a built-in 
superdisk is two drives in one and other drives are on the way out. 
We can save a little. Superdisk can save a lot. Together we can save 
the world. Superdisk... from imation. Available in AWARD winning winbook 
notebooks.
