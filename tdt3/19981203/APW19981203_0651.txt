The NHK Trophy, the sixth and final event of the figure skating Grand 
Prix, opened Thursday with French pair Marina Annissina and Gwendal 
Peizerat leading in the compulsory program of ice dancing. Irina Lobacheva 
and Ilia Averbukh of Russia were second, followed by Lithuanians Margarita 
Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas, Kati Winkler and Rene Lohse of Germany 
and Tatijana Navka and Roman Kastamarov of Russia. It is a non-point 
event for Lobacheva and Averbukh, who have already qualified for the 
Champions Series final in St. Petersburg, Russia, in March. Figure 
skaters are allowed to compete in only three of the six events in 
a season, designating two for points scoring in order to be able to 
compete in the series final. Three dance couples have qualified, leaving 
two places to be settled at the NHK Trophy. Top contenders are Olympic 
bronze medalists Annissina and Peizerat, currently on 12 points. Drobiazko 
and Vanagas are currently tied in fourth place at 16 points with Barbara 
Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy, who are not competing 
here. There are two couples in the field on 7 points _ Winkler and 
Lohse, third in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and the new paring of Navka 
and Kastamarov, third in Russia last month. If there is a tie for 
the fifth after the competition here, both couples will qualify for 
the final. The NHK Trophy has fewer big-name skaters this time, with 
Russians Elena Sokoiova, Maria Butyrskaya, Alexei Yagudin and Alexei 
Urmanov and other leaders on the standings skipping the event after 
qualifying for the series final. Even without Olympic champions competing 
this season, the Russians have so far won 14 of 20 titles. In Skate 
America and Skate Canada, the Russians won four of the eight events. 
They swept the titles in Gelsenkirchen and added two more at the Lalique 
Trophy competition in France. Like Gelsenkirchen, they swept all four 
in Moscow. Men's gold medalist Ilia Kulik and pairs champion Oksana 
Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev have bypassed the Grand Prix series this 
year, preferring to enter pro-ams and do the show circuit while staying 
eligible for future Olympic competition.
