Serb forensic experts said Thursday they have recovered 81 bodies 
from various cemeteries in Sarajevo over the past 10 days, many of 
them suspected Serb victims of wartime atrocities. Among the bodies 
are 27 presumed victims of Musan Topalovic, the Bosnian Muslim warlord 
known as Caco, the experts told reporters. Caco, killed later in a 
government sweep on criminals, massacred more than two dozen Serb 
civilians in 1993 and left their bodies in a pit at the edge of the 
city. Sarajevo's Muslim authorities later had the bodies buried in 
a Sarajevo cemetery from where the Serb teams exhumed them recently 
under an agreement with Bosnia's Muslim officials and foreign diplomats 
overseeing postwar Bosnia. Milan Ivancevic, a member of the Serb forensic 
team, praised the ``great help from ... Muslim and international officials.'' 
Other members of the team said exhumations would resume in March, 
with the onset of warmer weather, and investigations of how Serbs 
buried during the war in Sarajevo died would continue. The Serb figures 
were contested by Vlado Raguz, an undertaker in charge of funerals 
in Sarajevo during the war. He asserted in separate comments that 
among the remains exhumed by the Serbs was a Croat who died of natural 
causes. About 200,000 people were killed in the 3 1/2 year Bosnian 
war that ended in 1995 with the U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement. 
An additional 20,000 went missing and are feared dead. Exhumations 
have been conducted by all three sides _ Muslims, Croats and Serbs 
_ since 1995 in an effort to track down the fate of the missing. No 
totals exist on the number of bodies recovered since then. But international 
and Muslim experts have recovered more than 2,000 bodies in northwestern 
Bosnia, many of them apparently Srebrenica inhabitants massacred after 
the Serbs overran the Muslim enclave in 1995. And this year alone, 
more than 1,700 bodies were recovered by all three sides, according 
to statistics released by the office of the Bosnian High Representative, 
Carlos Westendorp. Of those, about 1,300 were Muslims, apparently 
killed by Serbs or Croats. The three sides signed an agreement in 
1996 committing them to allow burials of victims in the towns and 
communities they came from even if these are now controlled by other 
ethnic groups. But Jasmin Odobasic, a member of the Muslim commission 
for missing persons, said Serbs controlling Srebrenica have refused 
requests from family members of Muslim victims for such burials.
