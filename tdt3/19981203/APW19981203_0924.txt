Eight men were killed in western India when the iron scaffolding they 
were working on collapsed Thursday, doctors said. Firemen rescued 
17 others from the debris where the men had been working on repairs 
to the 20-story Stirling Apartments, located in an upscale residential 
area in downtown Bombay. After several recent building collapses in 
India's financial hub, city authorities set up committees to investigate 
unauthorized construction and poor building techniques in Bombay.
