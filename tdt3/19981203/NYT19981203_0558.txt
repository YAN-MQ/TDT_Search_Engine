Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson and National Football League commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue are angry _ though for different reasons _ over a subject 
that has had telephone lines burning this week across the league. 
Never before has the officiating gotten so many people so mad. On 
Tuesday, Tagliabue, who is highly respected by the NFL owners, faxed 
a letter to Wilson, stating that he intended to fine him $50,000 for 
his critical comments after two controversial calls in Buffalo's loss 
to the New England Patriots last Sunday. Detroit Lions owner William 
Clay Ford, who was highly critical of several calls during his team's 
overtime victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thanksgiving Day, 
was faxed an identical letter. During that game, the Lions benefited 
when an official misinterpreted the Steelers' call of the coin toss 
in overtime, but Ford called the game one of the worst officiated 
he had ever seen. Thursday, Wilson publicly blasted Tagliabue for 
``pompous lectures.'' Tagliabue, in turn, was said to be furious. 
``The commissioner lecturing to me as if I were a novice, instead 
of one who has been involved in football indefinitely longer than 
he has, contends that criticizing a call has `destructive and corrosive 
effects on the game,''' said the 80-year-old Wilson in a statement. 
``What is more destructive and corrosive _ errant calls in front of 
millions of viewers, or my statements of opinion?'' Wilson continued. 
``People all over the country registered shock at the way the officials, 
however honorable their purpose, took the game away from us. Even 
the league has admitted to us that the calls near the conclusion of 
the game were incorrect.'' Wilson added, ``I do know I don't need 
pompous lectures from the commissioner and I feel that the $50,000 
is not only unwarranted, but punitive in nature. The next time he 
may ask me to sit in the corner.'' Wilson is considered by his peers 
to be one of the most admired owners in the league, someone who has 
always acted with class. So his comments were considered shocking 
_ no one would ever expect Wilson to make his outrage public. It is 
an indication of just how angry Wilson is. Wilson could face yet another 
fine from Tagliabue because of his latest statement, said one league 
official who spoke on condition on anonymity. That official said Tagliabue 
was ``furious'' over Wilson's words, though a league spokesman said 
Tagliabue was simply ``very concerned.'' Tagliabue, the official said, 
will probably issue the fine by the end of the week. Then Tagliabue 
will evaluate if another fine is warranted. It is also possible that 
Tagliabue could issue both fines simultaneously, if indeed Tagliabue 
decides another fine is necessary. The Bills lost, 25-21, to the Patriots, 
thanks mainly to two controversial officiating calls. The first call 
came during a fourth-and-9 play, during which New England wide receiver 
Shawn Jefferson was awarded a 10-yard catch after replays clearly 
showed he was out of bounds. The second call was pass interference 
which occurred in the end zone as several offensive and defensive 
players jumped for a desperation pass that set up the winning touchdown. 
Wilson, however, has opposed having the NFL return to the use of instant 
replay to review officials' calls. Those calls, combined with the 
coin-toss foulup in the Thanksgiving Day game between the Steelers 
and Lions, led to a week of NFL officials being criticized perhaps 
more than ever. The league even changed the coin-toss procedure; now 
a player must tell the officials the team's choice before the coin 
is tossed into the air, not while the coin is being tossed. The Steelers' 
Jerome Bettis called tails at the outset of overtime in the Lions' 
game, but the official claimed that Bettis had said heads, and as 
a result Pittsburgh had to kick off to Detroit, instead of receive. 
Detroit then scored on its first possession to win that game. Wilson 
said that he has not decided if he will pay the fine or appeal it, 
though a league official said that in the end he thinks Wilson will 
calm down, pay the fine and work out the situation with Tagliabue.
