With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
Temperatures from the northeast to the mid-atlantic, the gulf coast 
and south central plains, well, those readings are going to be above 
normal for this time of year. Temperatures that had been quite warm 
across the northern great plains, we start to see them get chipped 
away just a bit, especially across the dakotas, not quite as warm 
as it has been. Here's the reason why. Our frontal system is going 
to be moving through. As it does, there goes the snowfall across the 
northern Sierra Nevada. It could be heavy at times. And it looks like 
flurries across the northern Rockies into the wasatch. And maybe a 
couple of thunderstorms across the lower Mississippi river valley. 
And not very nice weather the last couple of days at the Hawaiian 
islands nor the Caribbean. That looks like it continues with some 
trade winds across the Hawaiian islands at 45 miles an hour. Our extended 
forecast for Friday is still very mild along the gulf coast and southeast. 
On Saturday, you might see some snowfall through the Great Lakes. 
Then by Sunday, much colder across the interior west. For more weather 
information, log on to CNN.com.
