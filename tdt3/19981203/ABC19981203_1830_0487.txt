A warm weather trend that started around Thanksgiving has kept on 
giving. Today, there were record highs across most of the country, 
from Topeka, kansas, all the way east to Newark, New Jersey. Here's 
ABC's Jim Williams. This is not the Caribbean. This is Chicago in 
early December. Like much of the country, the city has rarely had 
so many consecutive warm days this late in the year. Chicago's downtown 
ice rink normally looks like this. Today, it only has puddles. Four! 
But the city's golf courses are drawing record crowds. It's been a 
wonderful boom in tee times for us. We're elated that we've more than 
doubled our rounds from last year at this time. It is all because 
the northern jet stream, which gives us cold air, is trapped in Canada. 
That's especially good for 35 million Americans who suffer from some 
form of seasonal affective disorder, better known as the winter blues. 
This year, higher temperatures and sunnier days are helping sufferers 
fight depression. It's delaying the development of symptoms. And for 
those who are already beginning to feel symptoms, they are often times 
feeling better. For others, though, warm weather is bad for business. 
New England's ski hills are snowless and ski shops are empty. In New 
York, heating oil companies have few customers. It's just a bad situation 
for everybody. But forecasters have good news for them, and perhaps 
bad news for the rest of us, the cold should return next week. Jim 
Williams, ABC News, Chicago.
