You're listening to The World. Not forget you can join us anytime 
online at www.theworld.org. This is The World on PRI, that's Public 
Radio International. I'm Lisa Mullins: Still to come on The World, 
the first African World War. That's what they're calling the civil 
war in the Democratic Republic of Congo and madness, that's what they're 
calling a plan to put more people in downtown Hong Kong. This is like 
putting 650,000 people into Central Park in New York, It simply doesn't 
work. First, this news.
