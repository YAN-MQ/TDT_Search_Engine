Heat wave. December feels like may. And proof that man has changed 
local weather patterns for the worse. Risk factors, breast cancer. 
New evidence tonight of a strong link to commonly used pesticides. 
And "in depth" -- the fugitive. The death row killer who got away. 
Still no sign of him, where he may be, and how he fooled everyone.
