Minutes before the space shuttle "endeavour" was scheduled to lift 
off, an alarm sounded that kept controllers busy long Fluff to ground 
the shuttle for the day. The "endeavour" missed the launch window 
by a few seconds. The window is determined by the orbit of the first 
international space station, part launched by the Russians two weeks 
ago T crew is scheduled to hook up the second part of the space station. 
NASA will try to launch "endeavour" again tomorrow morning. Launch 
controllers have determined the alarm went off after a momentary dip 
in hydraulic pressure. The zarya, the Russian Module was launched 
two weeks ago. What we have to do is wait until the earth rotating 
underneath the orbital plane of the zarya. It's a very, very tricky 
thing to do. It limbed us to 3:42. Today's delay is expected to cost 
NASA $650,000, most in overtime pay and fuel for the shuttle.
