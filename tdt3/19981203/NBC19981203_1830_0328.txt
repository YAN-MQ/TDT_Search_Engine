And from the world of medical science tonight, a major new study on 
the causes of breast cancer and a familiar villain. NBC's chief science 
correspondent Robert Bazell has more. The study out today adds a strong 
piece of evidence to what has been a contentious scientific debate 
-- do pesticides increase the risk of breast cancer? For at least 
one pesticide, the answer appears to be yes. Scientists in Denmark 
followed more than 7,000 women for almost 20 years. This study sort 
of reopens the question of the relationship of pesticides to breast 
cancer. The Danish scientists tested for several chemicals. They concluded 
-- only one mattered, a pesticide called "dieldrin." The researchers 
found that for women with high concentrations in their body of dieldrin, 
the risk of breast cancer was twice as high as it was for women with 
low concentrations. Dieldrin is no longer for sale in this country. 
But farmers in the United States used it widely on many crops from 
1950 to 1974 when the environmental protection agency ruled it could 
be used only to kill termites. The manufacturer agreed to stop selling 
it altogether in 1987, largely because it caused cancer in lab animals. 
And although dieldrin is no longer used, it is still around, remaining 
in the environment and the human body for up to 100 years. Most significantly, 
dieldrin is one of several chemicals still in use that can mimic the 
effects of the female hormone, estrogen. Some scientists and environmentalists 
have been warning these chemicals could increase breast cancer risk. 
Here we're able to see that measured exposure to a pesticide 20 years 
earlier appears to be related to an elevated risk. Up to now, several 
studies, including the respected Harvard nurse's study, have found 
no link between pesticide exposure and breast cancer risk. But many 
activists and breast cancer survivors like Nancy Evans refuse to accept 
that conclusion. I think we need to get the pesticides out of the 
nation's food supply. When you heard you had breast cancer, did you 
start to think, "What in my life could have caused it?" I think everybody 
asks that question. You know, "what did I do?" Or "what was I exposed 
to, what happened that made me have cancer?" And with today's study, 
Evans and others now have solid evidence that at least one pesticide 
might be a cause. Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
