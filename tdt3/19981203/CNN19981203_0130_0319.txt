Bosnia's Muslim leaders are cheering the arrest of a Serb military 
leader accused of war crimes. And they're hoping his case will shed 
light on one of the worst massacres of the Bosnian civil war. Terry 
ozanich reports. General krstic has been charged with genocide relating 
to the fall of the town of srebrenica in 1995. The U.N. war crimes 
tribunal in the Hague indicted him secretly in October. Srebrenica 
had been declared a U.N. safe haven. It became the site of one of 
the bloodiest episodes of the Bosnian war. At least 6,000 Muslim men 
are believed to have been slaughtered by bosnian-Serb forces. The 
chief prosecutor of Yugoslav war crimes at the Hague calls krstic 
a Very significant military leader. He is thought to be the highest 
ranking Bosnian/Serb military member captured and a close Ally of 
former President Radovan Karadzic. U.S./NatO sfor troops nabbed krstic 
on Wednesday at noon in northeastern bosnia. This action was undertaken 
in accordance with sfor's mandate, which authorizes it to detain such 
persons when encountered in the course of its duties. Bosnian Serb 
president nikola poplasen disagrees. He says the move was clearly 
planned. But NATO says it stands by its actions, calling them a warning. 
Like previous actions to detain persons indicted for war crimes, the 
detention of radislav krstic stands as a warning to all those indicted 
for war crimes and still at large. It is hoped that this action will 
prompt other persons indicted for war crimes to surrender themselves. 
That doesn't appear likely. Out of more than 70 suspects indicted, 
only 25 are in detention. The Bosnian government says it hopes krstic's 
arrest will lead to clues about what happened at srebrenica. But that 
may hinge on prosecuting the two main war crimes suspects, Radovan 
karadzic and former Bosnian Serb military commander ratko mladic. 
And they are still at large. Terry ozanich, "Headline News."
