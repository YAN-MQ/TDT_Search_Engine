On his last CD, "Deuce is Wild," American blues legend B.B. King teamed 
up with big pop stars like Eric Clapton and Van Morrison. That collection 
may have introduced some new fans to B.B. King's music, but it wasn't 
the kind of sound longtime blues lovers might have hoped for. So for 
his newest album, VOA's Catherine Kohl reports that B.B. King is back 
to the basics with "Blues on the Bayou." There is no question who's 
in charge of "Blues on the Bayou." Seventy-three-year-young B.B. King 
asserts control writing all the songs and producing his own album 
for the first time. And for a change of pace and scenery, the blues 
legend took his touring band down to Cajun country near Lafayette, 
Louisiana to record. It was all done live in the studio which means 
no fixing mistakes afterwards or any fancy sounds added in later. 
It's just B.B. King and his band. The new B.B. King CD, "Blues on 
the Bayou," opens up with one of the three instrumentals on the collection. 
It's a real workout called "Blues Boys Tune," but the Mississippi 
native really starts cooking when he revs up two of his older numbers, 
"Blues Man," and the angry, "I Got Some Outside Help I Don't Need." 
That is B.B. King and a new version of "I Got Some Outside Help I 
Don't Need" off his new CD, "Blues on the Bayou." It sounds like producer 
King had one main instruction to his band: relax, and get into the 
groove. On "Shake It Up and Go," the ten-man band's decision to swing 
out sounds almost spontaneous as if it grew out of a studio jam session. 
"Shake It Up and Go" is off the new B.B. King CD, "Blues on the Bayou." 
While all the 15 tracks on this record are solid, it's the instrumentals 
that really swing like this one called "If That Ain't It, I Quit."
