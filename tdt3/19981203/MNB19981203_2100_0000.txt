There has been a late discovery tonight in Texas, after a long and 
dramatic manhunt, the fugitive from death row there has been found 
dead tonight. Records falling all over the country, as temperatures 
soar. It feels like may in December, and NASA may have the reason 
why. What the republicans did today and what we now know will not 
be considered as the house goes through with impeachment charges against 
the Clinton White House. And after too many examples, American companies 
have now learned a lesson they are teaching that exact lesson to their 
executives who travel.
