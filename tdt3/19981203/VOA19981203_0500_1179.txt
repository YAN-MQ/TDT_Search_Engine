The most successful franchise in U.S. Major League Soccer, DC United, 
has named its new head coach.. As VOA's Parke Brewer reports, Thomas 
Rongen will replace U.S. National team coach Bruce Arena in Washington. 
DC United had to search for a new coach after Bruce Arena was selected 
as U.S. National team coach in October. The club's president selected 
Thomas Rongen, a veteran and the last coach who is from the Netherlands. 
Rongen was MLS Coach of the Year in the league's first season in 1996, 
leaving the Tampa Bay Mutiny to 20 wins and 12 losses. The following 
season, he left to coach the New England Revolution who offered him 
a big salary increase. But that team's problems on and off the field 
led to Rongen's resignation in late August. Rongen is excited to head 
up the club in the nation's Capitol, a city where he played briefly 
for the Washington Diplomats in the old North American Soccer League. 
This league is certainly different in its sake than the old NASL, 
and I think that right now, we focused on a new entity, and then we 
focused on DC United who certainly has been way more successful than 
the prior teams have been here. Thomas Rongen takes over a club that 
won the first two league titles and finished as runner up this season. 
He knows his job is to continue that winning tradition. Parke Brewer, 
VOA Sports, Washington.
