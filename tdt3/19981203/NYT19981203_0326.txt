Raising the stakes in the race to develop the next generation of computer 
memory chips, Toshiba Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. announced a joint venture 
Thursday that they said should allow both companies to reduce costs 
and development time. ``We aim to have one plus one equal three,'' 
Kazunari Shirai, senior vice president of Fujitsu, said at a news 
conference Thursday afternoon. The two companies will invest more 
than 30 billion yen, or $250 million, to jointly develop technology 
to manufacture dynamic random-memory access chips. They expect the 
new technology to be incorporated in manufacturing microprocessors 
and other types of computer chips whose functions go beyond those 
of a plain memory chip, saying its diversification beyond personal 
computers was ``essential'' given the high costs of development. The 
agreement immediately spurred speculation that the venture might lead 
to a merger, a suggestion the two companies did not immediately dismiss. 
Toshiba is making drastic moves, by Japanese standards, to reorganize 
its bloated business empire, including some small mergers; Fujitsu 
realigned its business a few years ago and is now the most profitable 
Japanese high-technology company. Koichi Suzuki, vice president in 
charge of Toshiba's semiconductor group, said there were no plans 
for more extensive ties but noted the intense competition that has 
eroded and in some cases even erased profit margins across the industry. 
``The term megacompetition has been used quite often recently,'' he 
said. ``If such factors do prompt it, we will consider'' a merger. 
The companies said the rising need for cost-efficient development 
processes drove them together. Suzuki said that IBM and Siemens had 
also been invited to join the venture, but that they declined. One 
hundred engineers from both companies will work to create a 1-gigabit 
memory chip using 0.13 micron processing technology at Toshiba's Advanced 
Microelectronics Center.
