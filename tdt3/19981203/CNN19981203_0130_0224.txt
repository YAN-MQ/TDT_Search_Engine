NASA says the chances space shuttle "endeavour" will blast off on 
schedule have improved to about 70%. A low cloud ceiling had threatened 
to cancel the launch, set for 3:56 eastern standard time Thursday 
morning. It only has a ten-minute window in which to hit the precise 
orbit for a Rendezvous with the new international space station. NASA 
says if the launch has to be scrubbed, it will be rescheduled for 
early Friday morning. The six-astronaut crew is bringing a connecting 
passageway called "unity" to the space station.
