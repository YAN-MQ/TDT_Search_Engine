The first official dialogue between head members from the European 
Union and North Korea have been held in Brussels, but as our correspondent 
Ron Pinstein reports from the Belgian capital, European officials 
are reserving judgment on the talks. The good news according to European 
officials is that the talks with North Korea were frank. All issues 
were discussed in the four-and-a-half-hour session, including human 
rights, nuclear issues, and food aid. At the same time, the European 
officials could not say if this sort of dialogue will be continued 
with North Korea. One official says the Europeans are reflecting on 
where we go from here. A delegation from the European parliament visits 
North Korea next week. The delegation will be led by former Belgian 
prime minister Leo Tindemans. It is the first high-level European 
delegation to make such a trip. The parliament members are also expected 
to discuss humanitarian aid and nuclear issues on their visit. While 
the meeting here with the North Koreans at the European Commission 
was the first in history, the Europeans are not ready to say if there 
will be a second one. Ron Pinstein, VOA News, Brussels.
