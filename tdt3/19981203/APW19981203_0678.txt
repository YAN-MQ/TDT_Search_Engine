The Russian government needs to come up with a more detailed economic 
recovery plan, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said today, just a 
day after the International Monetary Fund chief left without promising 
Moscow any new loans. Primakov's government has produced an anti-crisis 
program, but the measures have not reversed the country's economic 
slide, nor have they found favor with the IMF or other international 
lenders who have frozen loans to Russia. Primakov acknowledged the 
need to spell out the government's intentions more clearly and called 
on the Cabinet to do so. ``Without such a concrete action plan, containing 
concrete tasks and time frames, the government's steps will look merely 
like intentions,'' Primakov said. IMF chief Michel Camdessus left 
Russia on Wednesday after meeting with Primakov and other top officials. 
He praised Primakov's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with the crisis, 
but said an IMF team would have to return to Russia next month for 
further negotiations on loans. The IMF organized a $22.6 billion bailout 
package this summer, but only about $5 billion was disbursed before 
Russia's economic crisis hit in August and the loans were frozen. 
The IMF has indicated that Russia's draft budget for next year appears 
overly optimistic, and it also does not like moves to increase the 
government's role in the economy. Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants 
said the new plan envisages drafting more than 80 bills in the next 
two months to help revive the moribund economy. They will detail the 
government's intentions to subsidize some key industries, pay off 
wage and pension debts, index some incomes, restructure the banking 
system and tighten currency controls, he said. Some of these measures 
have been criticized by the IMF, but Shapovalyants said he hoped that 
will not prove a stumbling block to securing the loans. He added that 
Russia continues to count on IMF loans as it drafts next year's budget. 
Meanwhile, the speaker of Russia's parliament lashed out at the IMF 
for refusing to release loans. ``Look how they are mocking our government, 
sending one group after another,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist 
who serves as speaker for the State Duma, parliament's lower house. 
``Now Camdessus has come and again asked us to wait until tomorrow.'' 
Seleznyov suggested that Russia print more money to pay off its debts 
and then refuse to take any more loans. ``It's high time to take these 
shackles off Russia's feet,'' he told reporters. In other economic 
developments today: _ Inflation was up 5.7 percent in November, compared 
to 4.5 percent in October, the State Statistics Committee said. Inflation 
has calmed since shooting up in August and September in the immediate 
aftermath of the crisis. However, inflation is up about 70 percent 
compared to last December, Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko 
said. _ Russia's hard currency reserves dropped by $200 million in 
the last week of November and stood at $12.8 billion on Nov. 27, the 
Central Bank said today.
