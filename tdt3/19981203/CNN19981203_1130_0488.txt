I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Temperatures today, again, very warm over most of the east. Averaging 
some 15 to 25 degrees above normal, with 60s and 70s likely. We will 
find the colder temperatures, though, beginning to filter into the 
rockies. And our forecast calls for snow in that area, as low pressure 
tracks in through the Rockies. Low pressure is developing in the plains, 
and that will pick up some moisture. And so we'll find better chances 
for showers and thunderstorms as we head into late tomorrow. High 
pressure and fair weather continues over much of the southeastern 
U.S. a look now at the extended forecast. On Saturday, heavy snows 
are in the forecast in the Rockies as temperatures turn colder. Showers 
through the Great Lakes and warm temperatures along the gulf coast, 
the forecast highs into the 80s. On Sunday, again it's warm in the 
southeast. We'll find showers and storms through the midwest and snow 
through the upper midwest as temperatures turn colder. The cold temperatures 
will continue to filter eastward during the day on monday, along that 
front which will produce scattered showers and storms over a good 
part of the east, and snow through the northern lakes. For more weather 
information, log into CNN.com.
