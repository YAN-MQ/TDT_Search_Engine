Sig the poodle draws stares from passersby in Sacramento, California, 
not just for his good looks. In fact, sig is hard to ignore when he's 
leaping six feet in the air. His owner says the dog's jumping confused 
her at first, but now she just lets sig do his thing. She says he 
jumps when he wants to take a walk or when the mail carrier comes 
by, or if he sees another dog. So he's jumping a lot.
