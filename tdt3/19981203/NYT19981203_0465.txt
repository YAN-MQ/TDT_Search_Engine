The next time a youth-obsessed advertising agency convenes a focus 
group to divine how to spend a client's money, maybe Jack McQuillan 
should be included. Or Jimmie Troccoli. Or Richard Handel. These three 
men have lived a combined 208 years and are fulfilling shared, long-held 
fantasies that would tax the imagination, drive and pocketbooks of 
many people half their ages. What unites Messrs. McQuillan, Troccoil 
and Handel is a love of flying planes and, at last, the leisure time 
and the money to realize their dreams. They are yet another indication 
that Madison Avenue's adoration of the 18-to-49 age group, advertising's 
Holy Grail, lags well behind the demographic curve in a nation whose 
population is inexorably aging. Americans over 50 control much more 
wealth than their children or grandchildren, noted Theodore Roszak 
in an article in the October-November issue of Civilization, the magazine 
of the Library of Congress. Indeed, people over 50 account for half 
the nation's disposable income, 75 percent of its financial assets 
and 80 percent of its savings and loan accounts, wrote Roszak, who 
is also the author of ``America the Wise: The Longevity Revolution 
and the True Wealth of Nations.'' And Americans over 65 enjoy twice 
as much discretionary income as those aged 25 to 34. McQuillan, 62, 
a retired New York City detective sergeant from Staten Island, has 
dreamed of flying since he was 7 and is taking lessons to earn a private 
pilot's license _ despite medical problems that might have turned 
someone less determined to shuffleboard. Troccoli, 78, a semiretired 
manufacturers' representative from West Orange, N.J., became obsessed 
with flying in 1927, also at age 7, when Charles A. Lindbergh flew 
nonstop from New York to Paris. Two years later, Troccoli took his 
first airplane ride, but it wasn't until 1965 that he received his 
pilot's license; he has since logged more than 3,000 hours in the 
air. He is now qualified to fly just about anything with wings and 
thinks nothing of renting a Lear jet and ferrying friends to Las Vegas 
for a night at the casinos. Handel, 68, lives in Maplewood, N.J., 
and is retired from his family's furniture-manufacturing business. 
Like his friend Troccoli, he has wanted to fly since childhood. So 
now he, too, is working toward a private pilot's license. He calls 
it his ``unfinished business.'' As a boy, McQuillan hung around an 
airport on Staten Island, sometimes scraping together $2 for an airplane 
ride. The airfield has long since been replaced by the Staten Island 
Mall, but that early love of flying stayed with him through a four-year 
stint in the Marine Corps and 34 years on the police force. ``I was 
just always too busy working, and my money had to go for raising a 
family,'' he said. ``But the dream was always there.'' The dream, 
however, almost ended. A diabetic, McQuillan developed cataracts in 
both eyes two years ago. He had successful eye surgery, but the Federal 
Aviation Administration prohibited people with diabetes like his from 
getting a pilot's license. ``I was pretty discouraged,'' he recalled. 
Then, last year, the FAA changed its rules and allowed insulin-dependent 
diabetics to fly, with certain restrictions. ``I was back in the game,'' 
he beamed. On April 3, 1997, McQuillan became a student pilot at the 
Caldwell Flying Academy at the Essex County Airport in New Jersey 
and is looking forward to taking the FAA tests for his pilot's license. 
Troccoli, who quit school after the eighth grade to go to work, also 
delayed his flying ambitions until he had enough money. He owns a 
single-engine Cessna and flies almost every day. He holds an air transport 
commercial pilot's license and is qualified to fly multi-engine planes 
and jets, as well as gliders and seaplanes. He earned his jet rating 
when he was 72. And he's not finished. ``I want to get a helicopter 
rating and an instructor's license,'' he said. Handel started pilot's 
training two years ago at the Morristown Municipal Airport in New 
Jersey, where he met Troccoli. The two became friends and flying buddies. 
``When I started taking lessons, I felt a little strange,'' Handel 
said. ``Everybody seems to be 25, 28 or 30 years old. I sort of wished 
there was someone a little older around. Then I met Jimmie. I felt 
a lot better.'' Handel will soon be able to take his FAA tests, but 
is in no hurry. ``I'm trying to be the safest pilot around,'' he said. 
Why have these three clung to their youthful ambitions across the 
decades? Perhaps McQuillan put it best: ``You know how everybody has 
dreams in which they are flying? Well, flying low and slow in a small 
plane is as close as you can come to that in this life.''
