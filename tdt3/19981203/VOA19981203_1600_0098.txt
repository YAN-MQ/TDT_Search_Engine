The Human Rights Watch annual report has harsh words for the Clinton 
administration for not supporting several human rights initiatives, 
including the International Court of Justice and an anti-land mine 
treaty. The report noted improvement in the former Soviet Union, Latin 
America, South Africa, and parts of Asia but added serious problems 
persist. The human rights group said the world has seen a transformation 
in the way governments are expected to treat their people and each 
other. In Azerbaijan, human rights records continue to be abysmal. 
The U.S.-based group criticized the government of President Geidar 
Aliyev for promising improvements in human rights while doing nothing 
concrete to improve the living conditions.
