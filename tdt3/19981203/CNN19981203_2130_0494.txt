This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Friday. It'll turn a bit cooler in the northeast as a 
cold front moves through with a few showers. We'll also see showers 
in the southern Great Lakes and along a frontal boundary in the middle 
and lower Mississippi river valley. Look for heavy snows in the rocky 
mountains as low pressure pushes into that region. Another low pressure 
center will keep some rain showers or mountain snow over California. 
Highs on Friday -- 20s and 30s generally in the northwest, but still 
mild across the southeast. Looking ahead to Saturday, we'll see showers 
around the Great Lakes, heavy snow in the Rockies and rain in the 
northwest once again. On Sunday, as cooler air tries to push through 
the plains states, we'll see showers and storms pushing across the 
Mississippi river valley, some snow in the upper midwest. Finally, 
Monday, most of the east sees rain or snow. There'll be showers in 
the northwest. And things are turning a bit cooler with 20s and 30s 
over the upper midwest.
