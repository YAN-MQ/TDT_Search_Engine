Good afternoon. Wall Street was stuck in a swoon all day long, closing 
down a moment ago at 176 unofficial close, I should point out. The 
NASDAQ off 37 points. The market couldn't pull itself out of the slump 
even when the major european countries announced a surprise cut in 
interest rates. Traders are worried about the situation in Latin America.

that spooked Wall Street. We'll have more in business news in about 
15 minutes.
