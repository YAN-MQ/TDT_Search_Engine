He's been described as the anti-Newt for his low public profile, but 
today, he is speaking to the media. The 55-year-old Louisiana republican 
held a news conference with Trent Lott just moments ago. The two men 
discussed plans for the 106th Congress which meets January 6th. They 
also answered questions about efforts to expand the house Judiciary 
committee's impeachment inquiry and the possibility of censure against 
President Clinton. Livingston says he'll reserve judgment until a 
report is issued. This is not something that should be taken lightly. 
It's not something that should be, that should invoke pressure from 
any one sector of the Congress or other. Each member of Congress that 
is responsibility to search his heart, conscience, and judge for himself 
the importance to his constituents when his vote should be. And, I 
think for us to arbitrarily prejudge the conditions understand which 
he casts that vote is unfair at this point because we really don't 
know what the recommendations of the Judiciary committee are going 
to be. Livingston has been criticized by some republicans for his 
proposal to extend the House of Representatives' work week from three 
days to five.
