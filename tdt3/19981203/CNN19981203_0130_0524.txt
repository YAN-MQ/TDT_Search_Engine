Two Ohio boys who were stranded in a freight train car for eight days 
might have been saved by beer. 15-year-old John Wayne Riley and 12-year-old 
Billy Ray Grimes say they hopped a slow-moving train in Hamilton to 
escape a group of thugs. Two miles later, they hopped another train 
headed for Trenton, Ohio. Somehow, the boxcar doors slammed shut and 
locked, trapping the two for almost a week without heat, light or 
food. They say they survived on stale beer from empties being returned 
to a Brewery. We thought we was going to die. We kept thinking it. 
I said, "Billy, I don't think we are going to get out of here." He 
just started crying and screaming. We just sat up and talked, Sang, 
sleep and drank some beer. It was all we could do. We was talking 
about how we was going to get out. And if we could get out, what could 
we do to change? A brewery employee taking inventory in the rail yard 
finally heard the boys pounding on the doors and let them out. Authorities 
suspect they were running away from home.
