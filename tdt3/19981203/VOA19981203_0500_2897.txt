It is now coming up about 10 hours 49 universal time. Here's the major 
news story we're following this hour. The scheduled launch of the 
Space Shuttle Endeavour was called off just seconds before lift off 
because of an equipment alarm. The shuttle with a component of the 
International Space Station on board could possibly be launched on 
Friday morning. We'll have an update on that story coming up in about 
12 minutes.
