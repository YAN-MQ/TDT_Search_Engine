A dog team race without snow? Yes, 35 mushers will set off Saturday 
with dog teams pulling carts or bicycles. The four-day race will take 
them across 200 kilometers (120 miles) of Los Monegros, a largely 
flat, semi-desert expanse in the Aragon region of northeast Spain. 
The dogs _ huskies, malamutes and Samoyeds _ will pull four-wheeled 
carts built especially for the event. ``There are no sleds because 
there is no snow,'' said Rafael Arnaiz, a spokesman for the regional 
tourism office. There are three categories of teams: carts with six 
to 12 dogs, carts with two to five, and bicycles with one to three. 
The largest of the modern-day chariots are about three meters long 
(10 feet) and 1.5 meters (five feet) wide. Drivers get a map and a 
compass and that's it. ``The terrain is so uniform that the hardest 
part is not getting lost,'' Arnaiz said. The winners in each category 
will get a ceramic trophy. The Aragon government has staged the race 
for the last six years as a promotional event to boost tourism in 
Los Monegros.
