The U.N. World Food Program has granted Ethiopia dlrs 94.8 million 
in development assistance. In an agreement signed Wednesday between 
the government and WFP, dlrs 90.2 million of the grant will be used 
to provide 215,817 tons of food assistance. The remainder, dlrs 4.6 
million, will be used for training, technical equipment, and monitoring 
and evaluation. ``The agreement provides a framework for community 
participation in Ethiopia's development efforts by allowing individuals 
and communities to rank their needs and propose their solutions,'' 
said WFP country director Judith Lewis. The agreement also will provide 
meals in schools and aims to alleviate poverty in cities, helping 
130,000 primary school students in four regions and 60,000 women in 
the capital. ``We want to tackle food insecurity issues before they 
reach crisis level,'' said Stephen Anderson, WFP's development coordinator 
in Ethiopia. Mulatu Teshome Ethiopian, deputy minister of economic 
development and cooperation, said the grant will support the government's 
efforts to attain food self-sufficiency, and to alleviate the chronic 
poverty in the country.
