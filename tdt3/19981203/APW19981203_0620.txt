India's political opposition demanded Thursday that the governing 
Hindu nationalists resign over their poor handling of the economy. 
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government should quit immediately, 
because it was leading the country toward stagflation, Rajesh Pilot 
of the main opposition Congress party said in parliament. Economists 
define stagflation as persistent inflation combined with stagnant 
consumer demand and high unemployment. Leaders of the 19-party governing 
coalition led by Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party rejected the call 
to step down. Still smarting from a setback in state elections last 
week, the BJP has found itself increasingly on the defensive for its 
handling of the economy and foreign affairs. Pilot and Geeta Mukherjee 
of the Communist Party of India said the BJP had lost elections in 
two key northern states, New Delhi and Rajasthan, and failed to topple 
Congress in a third because voters were angry over rising prices. 
None of the governing coalition's allies rose to Vajpayee's defense 
during the parliament debate on prices Thursday, though the partners 
reiterated their support for the government. Following the introduction 
of market reforms in 1991, India enjoyed a period of economic improvement. 
In recent months, however, the economy has faltered. The wholesale 
price index has risen to 8.6 percent from 5 percent since Vajpayee 
assumed power in March. Industrial growth has fallen to 1.4 percent 
in the year ending September, as compared to 8.5 percent in the previous 
year. BJP spokesman and member of parliament K.L. Sharma said that 
the economic slowdown was caused by international sanctions imposed 
after India tested nuclear devices in May. However, the government's 
own economic experts have been saying for months that the sanctions 
have had little effect. Sharma also blamed flooding in northern India 
that destroyed crops. ``A steep rise in overall prices was a temporary 
phenomenon which has been arrested by the government,'' he said.
