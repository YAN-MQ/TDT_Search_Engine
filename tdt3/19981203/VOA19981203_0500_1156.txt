Bad weather has forced the cancellation of the first training session 
for the men's Alpine Skiing World Cup downhill race. Thick fog rolled 
into the course on Whistler Mountain in British Columbia, Canada on 
Wednesday. Officials say the resulting poor visibility forced them 
to cancel the practice session. Organizers say they are hopeful that 
the conditions will improve enough by later today to allow the training 
to take place.
