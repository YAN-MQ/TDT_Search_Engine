OSLO, Norway (AP) - An international mission of unarmed observers 
is racing to build up its strength in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo 
province, fully aware of the risks its volunteers face, the head of 
the mission said Thursday. The Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe is sending 2,000 monitors to Kosovo in the hope that a large 
international presence will curb attacks on mainly ethnic Albanians. 
William Walker, head of the Kosovo Verification Mission, was in the 
Norwegian capital to brief a meeting of OSCE foreign ministers on 
the force, which is the biggest effort ever undertaken by the OSCE. 
Walker said about 500 observers were already in place, and that every 
four or five days another 125 would be completing a training course. 
``It is a very big effort and we are well underway,'' Walker told 
reporters. Under the terms of an Oct. 12 U.S.-brokered deal, Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow as many as 2,000 unarmed 
international monitors into Kosovo. They are charged with keeping 
track of the implementation of Milosevic's promises, including a military 
withdrawal and working toward a political settlement in Kosovo. Hundreds 
were killed and as many as 300,000 people fled their homes in a mainly 
Yugoslav Serb crackdown on the 90-percent ethnic Albanian province. 
Walker said virtually all of those who fled now have some kind of 
housing, even though many could not move back to their damaged homes. 
``My impression is that tensions have diminished,'' said Walker, who 
is based with the monitor corps in the Kosovo capital of Pristina. 
He said local residents seem reassured by the international presence. 
But he said dangers remain for the international volunteers, including 
anti-personnel mines that dot the countryside and the danger of firefights 
erupting between ethnic Albanian rebels and Yugoslav forces. ``Getting 
caught in a firefight between two groups that have weapons and like 
to fire at each other would be a very bad situation,'' he said. ``That 
worst-case scenario is pretty frightening.'' Walker said he hoped 
for a political solution before spring thaws make it easier for military 
units to move, increasing the risk of battles. NATO is prepared to 
come to the assistance of the monitors if they are threatened. The 
monitor mission now has 1,588 applicants from 34 countries, and 492 
have been accepted. Another 300 will be transferred from the diplomatic 
observer mission to the monitor force. Italy has so far offered the 
largest number of volunteers, 203, followed by Germany with 187, Britain 
with 158 and the United States with 143. OSCE officials said the force 
should reach full strength by mid-January. Walker rejected criticism 
that the force was build up too slowly, saying that in fact the progress 
had been fast, considering such practical difficulties as finding 
housing.
