A U.S. congresswoman suggested Thursday that a prominent Russian liberal 
lawmaker recently shot to death be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize 
_ even though that goes against prize rules. Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat 
from Ohio who is visiting Moscow, said members of the U.S. Congress 
considered Galina Starovoitova ``a sister in liberty and an outspoken 
advocate for the democratic rule of law and human rights,'' the Interfax 
news agency reported. Kaptur said that if Starovoitova wins the peace 
prize posthumously, some of the winnings should be used to support 
democratic reforms in Russia. However, Nobel prize rules say nominees 
must be living. Some winners have died after the prizes were announced 
but before the awards were presented. Since Soviet times, Starovoitova 
had been a staunch defender of political and market reforms and human 
rights, and she traveled often to the United States for speaking and 
teaching engagements. She was killed Nov. 20 in her apartment building 
in St. Petersburg. Police have announced no major breakthroughs in 
the case, but many believe the motive was political and may have been 
connected to an upcoming local election.
