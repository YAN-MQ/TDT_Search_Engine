The federal aviation administration has issued an emergency order 
to airlines operating Boeing 747s. It wants them to stop running fuel 
pumps in dry tanks because of the risk of explosion. The FAA says 
fuel pumps could cause hot spots and sparks when they're operated 
in dry conditions. 246 Boeing 747s registered in the United States 
are affected by the order. Airlines are advised to leave enough fuel 
in the center tank, and stop using the horizontal stabilizer tank.
