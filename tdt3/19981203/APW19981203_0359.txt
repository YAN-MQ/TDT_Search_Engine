Sweden's No.1 player Magnus Gustafsson was drawn to play Italy's No.2 
Davide Sanguinetti in the opening singles of the Davis Cup final Friday. 
In the second singles of the day Italy's top player Andrea Gaudenzi 
will be pitted against Magnus Norman as Sweden's top-ranked player, 
Thomas Johansson, was not included in the quartet for the three-day 
indoor final on clay at Assago Forum. Thursday's draw, in Milan's 
16th century city council hall, also provided Saturday's doubles between 
the Italian duo of Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso against the Swedish 
pair of Nicklas Kulti and Jonas Bjorkman. Gaudenzi takes on Gustaffson 
in a duel between Number Ones in the reversed singles Sunday wqith 
Sanguinetti playing Norman. It's the first time in the 99 years of 
tennis premier team event that there is no one in the top 30 of the 
ATP lists playing singles in the final. Gustaffson is the highlight 
with No. 31. Italy, which upset the United States in the semifinals, 
will be playing its seventh final - the first since 1980 and the first 
ever at home. Sweden, a six-time Davis Cup titlist, will be on its 
12th final at Assago.
