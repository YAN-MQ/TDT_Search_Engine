All the art, where did it all come from? Now here is Jane pauley with 
a programming note. Thanks, Brian. Tonight on "time & again," the 
most important person in Bill Clinton's corn, and never more popular 
in her own right, Hillary Clinton, standing by her man is something 
the first lady has done for years. During the Lewinsky scandal her 
loyalty helped to shore the president's survival. We look at Hillary 
Clinton's crucial role over the years as Bill Clinton's defender and 
chief. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, coming up next on "time 
& again." That is "time & again" with Jane pauley next on MSNBC. And 
that will do it for our broadcast this Thursday evening. We hope to 
see you right back here at this same time tomorrow night for the friday 
edition. I'm Brian Williams and for all of us here, just scant miles 
from the 24-hour old glow of the most famous Christmas tree in the 
country. Good night, everybody. I'm proud to introduce my husband 
and our president, Bill Clinton. Standing by her man and standing 
up for herself through one controversy after another. Over the years 
with first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. I'm Jane pauley, and this 
is "time and again." arewell. But it seems entirely appropriate to 
the subject matter. Good night and good luck.
