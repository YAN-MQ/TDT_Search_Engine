Israel's Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction against a government 
decision Thursday to remove the words `holy' and `martyr' from the 
tombstone of a Jewish settler who massacred 29 Muslim worshipers. 
The gunman, New York-born Baruch Goldstein, opened fire on the Palestinian 
worshipers in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the West Bank town of 
Hebron in February 1994, and was killed by survivors of the attack. 
Goldstein was called a hero by fellow settlers and was buried in the 
center of the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba. The Israeli 
army, which is responsible for administering the West Bank, decided 
two months ago to delete the words of praise from the inscription 
on the tombstone in an effort to discourage Jewish extremists from 
making pilgrimages to the site. In its decision the army invoked a 
new law making it illegal to erect monuments to militants. However, 
Goldstein's father Israel Goldstein petitioned the Supreme Court to 
prevent any changes at the tomb, which includes elaborate lighting, 
benches, a glass cabinet for prayer books, a limestone plaza and rose 
bushes. The Supreme Court Thursday issued a temporary injunction against 
the changes and ordered the government to show cause within 45 days 
why the words of praise should be deleted. Goldstein said Thursday 
at the court that his son really was a saint. ``People came to us 
with tears in their eyes when we were sitting shiva (in mourning) 
saying: your son saved us. We would have been there later on. They 
found weapons there.'' The court's decision on whether the army may 
delete the words from the tombstone will be given at a later date.
