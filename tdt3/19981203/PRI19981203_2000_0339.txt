The House of Representative's Judiciary Committee has decided not 
to follow up on an inquiry into alleged fundraising irregularities 
into President Clinton's 1996 election campaign. The fundraising allegations 
were added to the inquiry on Tuesday, but investigators examining 
documents in the case concluded there's nothing to follow-up. The 
committee is now expected to vote on Articles of Impeachment at the 
end of next week.
