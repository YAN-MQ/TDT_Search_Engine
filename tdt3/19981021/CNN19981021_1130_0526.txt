I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "Headline News weather." It's 
going to be rather autumn-like over the Great Lakes extending into 
the northeast today. Forecast highs only in the 40s and 50s. One more 
mild day in the southeast before the cool temperatures move in, with 
the cool weather already in place in the Rockies. Check your forecast, 
later today to late day Thursday shows more wet weather from west 
Texas into New Mexico, extending into Arizona and parts of Utah. Some 
higher elevation snows are possible. Look for high pressure to build 
in through much of the southeast. That will bring some cooler weather 
as an area of tropical weather moves through the southern bay of Campeche, 
bringing some wet weather in through northern Mexico. The extended 
forecast now, on Friday it will be coolest in the northeast back through 
the Great Lakes, only in the 40s and 50s once again. Scattered showers 
will continue in the Rockies. And it's warm over much of the west. 
On Saturday, we do find, again, warm temperatures in the southwest. 
Pretty dry much of the midwest and the east. We'll find some rain 
in the pacific northwest. On Sunday, more scattered showers expected 
there as cooler temperatures push in through the northern Rockies 
and the northwest. For more weather information, you can log in to
