Army soldiers raided a separatists' hideout Wednesday in the mountains 
of Kashmir near Pakistan, sparking a gunbattle that killed two soldiers 
and two separatists, police said. The violence coincided with the 
end of a two-day visit to the troubled Kashmir region by the U.S. 
Ambassador to India, Richard Celeste, who urged India and rival Pakistan 
to continue talks to resolve their dispute over the Himalayan region, 
which straddles both countries. The two countries have fought two 
wars over Kashmir, and India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamic separatists 
in its portion of Kashmir _ a charge Pakistan denies. Weekend negotiations 
by the countries' foreign secretaries failed to reach any agreement 
on Kashmir. The issue developed new urgency when both countries entered 
the world's club of declared nuclear powers by exploding nuclear devices 
earlier this year. Celeste met with both government leaders and representatives 
of separatist groups during his trip.
