When President Clinton was first elected, some of the military had 
trouble relating to a commander-in-chief who had been accused of dodging 
the draft and avoiding service. Now with the Monica Lewinsky scandal 
all around him, Mr. Clinton is drawing more fire and some in the military 
are speaking out about it publicly and bravely. But mim tear code 
prohibits this kind of thing from openly criticizing the president 
or any other government official. NBC news Pentagon correspondent 
Jim Miklaszewski filed this report this morning for today. In the 
United States, the president as commander-in-chief is in charge. The 
military takes the orders. But in the face of the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal, President Clinton's authority has been challenged by some 
of the military's rank and file. It comes from major Shane Sellers 
and appears in this week's edition of the Navy times in a scathing 
article entitled time to send Clinton to the showerers, they blast 
the president. Sellers goes on to suggest the president should be 
forced out of the office for lying under oath. Major Sellers is not 
the first person to call for the president's ousting or even call 
him a liar, but he's the first to do so as an active member of the 
military, and that according to the uniform code of military justice, 
is against the law. Article 88 specifically prohibits any commissioned 
officer from using contemptuous words against the president, the vice 
president, or other elected officials. No one has -- is forced to 
abide by these rules. They can get out of the military and say anything 
they want. If they're in the military, there are rules that govern 
their behavior. In fact, former joint chiefs chairman Colin Powell 
has condemned the president's conduct. When a number of Marines purportedly 
circulated petitions calling for the president's impeachment, they 
heard it was illegal. This man says the law is intended to preserve 
civilian authority over the military. The purpose of which is to maintain 
discipline and keep the military out of politics. The Marines are 
reviewing Sellers' case to determine what, if any, punishment he should 
face. Meanwhile, they'll continue to a salute smartly and follow the 
commander-in-chief. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC news, the Pentagon.
