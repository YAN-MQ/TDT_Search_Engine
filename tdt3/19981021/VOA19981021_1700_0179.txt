Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, says Congo-Kinshasa's allies 
have agreed to mount an offensive in eastern Congo where rebels control 
vast areas of land. He made the announcement after a strategy summit 
with the presidents of Angola and Namibia. Congo's allies played a 
central role in repelling a rebel advance on Kinshasa at the outset 
of the war. However, they have not had a large contingent in the east, 
enabling the rebels to mount several successful military campaigns 
against government positions.
