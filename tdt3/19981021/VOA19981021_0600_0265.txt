Italy's new Prime Minister-designate Massimo d'Alema has met with 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and presented his list of proposed 
government ministers. The 49-year-old Mr. d'Alema, leader of the Democrats 
of the Left Party, is expected to be sworn in later today and to seek 
a parliamentary vote of confidence in his government later in the 
week. The new government - Italy's 56th since World War II - will 
replace the administration of Romano Prodi, who resigned earlier this 
month after losing a confidence vote.
