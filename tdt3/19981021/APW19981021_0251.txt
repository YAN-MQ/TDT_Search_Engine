A former East German border patrol commander charged with the deaths 
of four people trying to escape across the Berlin Wall failed to appear 
in court Wednesday and was believed to have left the country. The 
court-appointed lawyer for Walter Schulze, 51, said she had not been 
able to speak with him. He ran a restaurant in Fuerstenwalde, outside 
Berlin, until last year, when he disappeared. Police say he notified 
the post office to forward his mail to an address in Spain, but there 
were also rumors that he was living in Russia. The court reserved 
decision on whether to issue an arrest warrant. Schulze and a co-defendant, 
Reinhard Gentzsch, are charged with four counts of manslaughter stemming 
from four deaths, including the February 1989 shooting of Chris Gueffroy, 
the last person killed trying to flee over the Berlin Wall. Prosecutors 
say they were involved in drawing up and issuing basic orders for 
guards at the Berlin Wall between 1985 and 1989, when it fell. The 
trial against Gentzsch, 45, began as scheduled.
