The Russian Foreign Ministry has ordered its ambassadors in several 
West European capitals to help Russian truckers stranded by the country's 
economic crisis, a news agency said Wednesday. Russian truckers are 
stuck, with no money to come home, in Germany, France, Britain, Belgium, 
the Netherlands and Ireland, Interfax said. Many have not received 
the goods they were sent to collect and bring back to Russia, said 
Lev Shoikhet, the head of the Land Road Transport Department of the 
Russian Transport Ministry. Russia's financial crisis, which erupted 
in mid-August, caused the ruble to plunge, making imports more expensive. 
It also paralyzed the banking system, especially transactions involving 
foreign transactions and foreign currencies. Russian ambassadors have 
been ordered to collect information about Russian truckers and trucks 
stuck in foreign countries because they have no money to return home, 
and give them financial assistance, Interfax said. The International 
Transport Federation said that 10,000 truckers from Russia, Belarus, 
Ukraine, Latvia, Bulgaria and other East European countries have been 
stranded in Western Europe while sorting out their financial problems. 
The Russian financial crisis had a spillover effect on other former 
Soviet republics and on Russia's East European neighbors. Most of 
the truckers have been abandoned by their companies, the federation 
said, according to Interfax. Shoikhet estimated about 500 to 600 Russian 
trucks are stuck in Western Europe.
