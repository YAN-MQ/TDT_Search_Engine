In today's popular culture, the journey between fast buck and sheer 
greed has a stopover called ``sequel.'' Book publishing, alas, is 
no different in this from the movies or television. The most recent 
excursion into what could become publishing's latest nostalgia black 
hole is a sequel to the Hollywood classic ``Casablanca.'' This time 
it's a novel, titled ``As Time Goes By,'' which is actually both a 
sequel and a prequel, with the melancholy memories from the movie 
as the cream in the middle of the cookie. Can the sequel movie to 
this sequel novel be far behind? If nothing else, whatever happens 
to the book, it could become a trivia-question answer. For at last, 
after years of postulation and theorizing, this novel may be the first 
genuine and true piece of entertainment synergy, that Shangri-La of 
the media business. That is, Warner Books commissioned the fiction 
at the behest of Warner Bros., its moviemaking sibling, which owns 
``Casablanca'' and recently released a special video edition of it. 
``As Time Goes By'' was launched with a huge advertising and publicity 
campaign and a whopping first printing of 250,000 copies, making it 
a Warner big book for the fall. Maureen Egen, president of Warner 
Books, said: ``It's a great story of very brave people doing extraordinary 
things. It's one of the greatest unfinished love stories ever.'' True 
enough. And, Ms. Egen added, ``There's so much of the story not known 
because the movie couldn't tell it all.'' What was needed was ``a 
writer who could do great research and put the characters into historical 
context, not just tell what happened to the characters,'' she said. 
Also true. But for all of this, the novel has gotten off to a rather 
slow start in its first two weeks in the bookstores, and, like movies 
themselves, it is often the first two weeks that determine the future 
of a book as commercially planned as this. Still, there is money to 
be made overseas. The rights for this novel, written by Michael Walsh, 
a novelist and a former music critic for Time magazine, have already 
been sold to 15 foreign publishers. Somewhat surprisingly, booming 
sales are predicted in Germany, though the movie is hardly neighborly 
about Germans. At the recent Frankfurt book fair, its German publisher, 
Schneekluth, more or less replicated Rick's cafe as its booth, and 
it reportedly is already taking reorders for the novel, titled there 
``Fuer Immer Casablanca,'' which translates to ``For Always Casablanca.'' 
However well the book sells, one thing seems certain. People won't 
be quoting the dialogue in it as they still do from the movie. ```Where 
are we going?' asked Ilsa. `To the headquarters of the Czech government-in-exile 
since the fall of France,' he said as he closed the door behind them. 
`To London.''' The list of literary sequels that disappeared or did 
only moderately well is long. In 1984, John Wheatcroft revisited Wuthering 
Heights with ``Catherine, Her Book'' (Cornwall Books), which deftly 
captured the Gothic but not an abundance of readers with Catherine 
Earnshaw's journal. Emma Tennant did two Jane Austens for St. Martin's 
Press, ``Pemberley'' and ``An Unequal Marriage.'' ``She did a great 
job of writing Jane Austen, but they sold OK, not great,'' Sally Richardson, 
president and publisher of the St. Martin's Press trade division, 
said. ``The books got more esteem than commercial success.'' Each 
sold about 20,000 copies, she said. In 1993, a ``Rebecca'' sequel, 
``Mrs. de Winter'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co.) by Susan Hill, made 
The New York Times' fiction best-seller list for one week. With this 
history of paltry sales, why do publishers keep trying to resurrect 
our fictional heroines and heroes and our romantic memories? For several 
reasons. Who wouldn't like one more journey with Rick (Bogart) and 
Ilsa (Bergman) or Heathcliff (Olivier), on the page or on the screen? 
And despite appearances at times to the contrary, publishers do like 
strong characters. Moreover, some few in book publishing have even 
retained a tinge of the rhapsodical. But mainly it's business, the 
wish for the big payoff. Sometimes it hits. ``Scarlett'' (Warner Books, 
1991) by Alexandra Ripley, the 823-page sequel to Margaret Mitchell's 
``Gone With the Wind,'' sold about 4 million copies in hardcover and 
about 2 million in paperback, Ms. Egen said. It was on The Times' 
hardcover fiction best-seller list for 34 weeks; in its wake ``Gone 
With the Wind'' was pulled onto the list for 10 weeks, which made 
the whole thing worth the $4.95 million Warner Books had to pay Mitchell's 
heirs for the rights to the sequel she herself never would write. 
Now a second sequel to ``Gone With the Wind'' is in the works, but 
not at Warner. Ms. Egen says, somewhat happily, ``We felt that we 
had done the sequel and we weren't going to do another.'' The project 
for the second sequel is lost for the moment in the maw of negotiations 
at St. Martin's Press, where, Ms. Richardson said, ``we've been negotiating 
for two years.'' St. Martin's was said to have paid the Mitchell estate 
$4.5 million for the sequel to the sequel, and originally planned 
to have its Jane Austen, Ms. Tennant, change literary hats and become 
its Margaret Mitchell for this book. That plan went by the wayside. 
Ms. Richardson will only hint that when the final negotiations are 
over, the publishing world will be astonished by the fame and the 
accomplishment of the novelist who will do this sequel. It's a tough 
business, making a sequel work, no matter how astounding the writer. 
Even the great Mark Twain couldn't do it. He tried to earn his way 
out of heavy debt by writing two sequels to his ``Adventures of Tom 
Sawyer'' (1876) about 20 years later _ ``Tom Sawyer, Abroad'' (1894) 
and ``Tom Sawyer, Detective'' (1896). Both flopped.
