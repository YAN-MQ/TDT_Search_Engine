The Polish club Wisla Krakow on Wednesday disputed claims by Parma 
player Dino Baggio that he was struck by a knife thrown from the stands 
in a UEFA Cup match. At the same time, Parma officials stuck to Baggio's 
claim that it was a knife that hit him in the 80th minute of Tuesday's 
UEFA Cup second-round match, first-leg tie _ a 1-1 draw at Wisla. 
``You can see pretty well from the (television) tape that a metal 
object flew out of the stands,'' managing director Michele Uva told 
The Associated Press. ``According to our players it was a knife, and 
I think that there was some confirmation from the Poles.'' Baggio's 
wound required five stitches, Uva said, and Italy's World Cup starter 
will be examined again Thursday to determine if he can play in Parma's 
Serie A game Sunday. ``It landed on his head, but it could just have 
easily hit an eye or another part of the body. It is unfortunate that 
these things happen,'' Uva said. The Parma official said the Italian 
team would not contest the results with UEFA. ``The important thing 
is that UEFA examines what happened and its gravity.'' Baggio told 
the sports daily Corriere dello Sport felt a blow to his head and 
``then I saw a knife on the ground and I realized that that was what 
had hit me.'' ``I can't believe there are people who come to stadiums 
with knives,'' he told Gazzetta dello Sport. ``I only just missed 
it but thinking back to it gives me the shivers. Just think what would 
have happened if it had got me in the eye.'' However, Wisla spokesman 
Maciej Bobr, disputed Baggio's claim and said police were questioning 
players and fans about the incident. ``Nobody has seen anything like 
that, including the referees, the UEFA observers, Krakow or Parma 
officials,'' he said Wednesday. ``We are not saying that Baggio is 
lying, but in our opinion it could not have been a knife.'' He suggested 
Baggio was hit by a stone hurled by fans. Italian reports initially 
identified the object as a flick knife. Bobr questioned why _ if a 
knife were involved _ the incident wasn't reported immediately after 
it happened. He said Parma officials waited until after the match 
to inform UEFA officials. He said they did not bring it up during 
a post-game news conference He said Wilsa expressed regret to Parma 
over the incident but suggested the Italians could be trying to divert 
attention from their 1-1 draw against the underdog Poles. ``This is 
certainly not a success for Parma,'' he said. Poland's largest circulation 
newspaper Wyborcza Gazeta said two Wisla players suggested that Baggio 
was hit with some ``small metal object'' _ but said it wasn't a knife. 
The newspaper Rzeczpospolita quoted Wisla spokesman Maciej Bobr _ 
after speaking with Parma officials _ as saying Baggio was struck 
by an unidentified object. In Geneva, UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonnella 
said no action was planned until a match report was in hand. He said 
the matter would be referred to UEFA's control and disciplinary meeting 
in November. ``The incident was clear, there is no doubt about it,'' 
Gonnella said.
