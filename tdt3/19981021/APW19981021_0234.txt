British companies are interested in bidding for a share of the Philippine 
state-owned power generating company when it is privatized, British 
Trade Minister Brian Wilson said Wednesday. Wilson, who arrived Sunday 
to promote British investment in the Philippine power industry, said 
the Philippines is still ``a place with a big future'' despite Asia's 
currency crisis. The Philippine government is selling many of its 
assets, including energy holdings, to help fill a yawning budget deficit 
and further liberalize the economy. Wilson said he was told the government 
plans to privatize 40 percent of the National Power Corp. Philippine 
officials expect a law privatizing the power company will be passed 
by mid-1999, he said. Wilson said British power companies will ``take 
on as much as they could'' of the state-owned power company. The British 
power companies, once public companies themselves, could also share 
their experiences in privatization, he said. Wilson is traveling with 
nine officials from British power companies National Power, Powergen, 
National Grid, ALSTOM, AMEC, Balfour Beatty, British Gas, Rolls Royce 
and Cinergy. James A. Carmichael, general manager for Asia-Pacific 
of Powergen, expressed ``very high optimism'' that Asia will recover 
from its financial turmoil and will be a ``major growth area within 
the next decade.'' ``You cannot be a serious international player 
without being in the region,'' he said. Because of a power generating 
overcapacity in the Philippines and Indonesia, he said his company 
is interested in acquiring power generation and distribution companies 
rather than building new plants. It hopes to acquire the Philippine 
government's 31 percent stake in electricity distributor Manila Electric 
Co. ``We will not be a passive investor. We have to be active,'' he 
said, adding that his company wants a ``significant'' investment of 
between 25 and 50 percent in any company.
