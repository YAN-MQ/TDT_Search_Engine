Two goals each for Brazilian Savio and Croat Robert Jarni helped defending 
champion Real Madrid trounce Sturm Graz 6-1 in European Champions 
League play Wednesday. Sturm Graz took a surprise lead in the eighth 
minute when Ivica Vastic slotted one in from 16 yards (meters). But 
Madrid was determined not to let the game slip away and five minutes 
later Savio chested down the ball following a superb lobbing pass 
into the area by Yugoslav Pedrag Mijatovic. From some 10 yards (meters) 
out to the right, Savio swerved and thundered the ball into the back 
of the net for the equalizer. Real took a grip of the game nine minutes 
on when Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos flicked a sharp-angled pass 
to 21-year-old ace striker Raul who from six yards (meters) drove 
the ball under the diving body of goalkeeper Kazimierz Sidorczuk. 
Madrid's play lacked cohesion throughout the game, with its midfield 
and defense committing several blunders. Sturm Graz, however, rarely 
appeared to have the creative or attacking ability to seriously exploit 
the host's weaknesses. But despite the scrappy play, Real had no problem 
putting in the goals. In the 61st minute, Jarni steadied up on the 
left-side of the box and let fly a thundering shot into the far top 
right-hand corner of the Austrian side's goal. Six minutes later, 
Mijatovic sent a cross in from the left cornerkick area and Sturm 
Graz defender Ranko Popovic fumbled a clearance to score an own-goal 
and make it 4-1. The fifth came in the 80th minute when Jarni again 
ran to the left-hand corner of the box and let fly another shot that 
left Kazimierz stretching in vain. Three minutes into injury time, 
Savio headed the ball in from seven yards on a chip pass from Dutch 
midfielder Clarence Seedorf.
