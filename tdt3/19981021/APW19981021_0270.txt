Manila's corporate watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
will ask the U.S. Export-Import Bank to return two Boeing 747-400 
planes it seized from Philippine Airlines, officials said Wednesday. 
The SEC accepted a request from PAL that it ask the U.S. Ex-Im Bank 
to return the aircraft and stop seizing other planes the U.S. agency 
financed for the Philippine flag carrier, SEC officials said. A PAL 
official said Ex-Im Bank officials apparently lost their trust in 
the debt-laden airline and wanted to recover their assets. PAL announced 
Tuesday it will resume limited international service next week following 
a recent 13-day shutdown. The airline resumed domestic flights Oct. 
7 after shutting down over disagreements with its largest labor union 
over a management recovery plan. It had planned to resume international 
flights last week, but delayed their start at the request of prospective 
foreign investors. PAL said it will begin thrice-weekly flights Oct. 
29 between Manila and Los Angeles, with stopovers in San Francisco. 
Starting Nov. 11, it will serve the two U.S. destinations with separate 
flights from Manila, it said. It said it will resume daily flights 
to Tokyo Nov. 11, and gradually add more international flights as 
the peak Christmas season nears. PAL, which has been unable to make 
payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in debt, was devastated by a pilots' 
strike in June and by the region's currency crisis, which reduced 
passenger numbers and inflated costs. The airline, Asia's oldest, 
shut down operations on Sept. 23 after a union representing ground 
personnel turned down a management-proposed recovery plan that included 
a 10-year suspension of strikes and collective bargaining in exchange 
for 20 percent ownership of the company. Nearly two weeks after the 
shutdown, workers agreed to accept the plan.
