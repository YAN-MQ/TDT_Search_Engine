Pressed by nationwide student demonstrations, France's education minister 
on Wednesday announced new funding and more personnel to improve shoddy 
and overcrowded high schools. ``The students said clearly that high 
school reform should take place as quickly as possible,'' Claude Allegre 
told the National Assembly. Allegre said the government would hire 
25,000 more adults and 3,000 more youths to improve instruction and 
security in high schools across the country. Paris was setting aside 
4 billion francs (dlrs 730 million) in tax-free loans to regional 
governments to build and improve schools over the next four years, 
he said. Allegre said a ``students' charter'' would establish minimum 
conditions that all high schools would have to conform to within two 
months, and that by the next school year no class will have over 35 
students. The Education Ministry would also seek to ease heavy courseload 
by next year, fill missing teaching posts and boost foreign language 
instruction. There was no immediate reaction from students. Allegre 
unveiled the plan after meeting again with students earlier Wednesday, 
a day after nearly 300,000 youths took to the streets across the country. 
Tuesday's marches were smaller than ones last week that drew an estimated 
half million students across the country. French media on Wednesday 
read that as giving the leftist government more time to seek a solution. 
``The students half-protest,'' headlined the leftist daily Liberation. 
``It feels like the end,'' said the front page of the popular tabloid 
France-Soir, noting the weeklong Toussaint vacation begins at the 
end of the week. The Paris march that drew an estimated 25,000 students 
was marred by hooligans despite the deployment of about 4,500 police 
who conducted thousands of body searches. Helmeted riot police sprayed 
tear gas from aerosol cans to disperse unruly youths, who shattered 
windows in a posh Left Bank neighborhood and set fire to a subway 
car, temporarily interrupting service on one line. Police said 85 
people were lightly injured in Paris. Some 110 young people were arrested 
nationwide, they said, and 90 of them were taken into custody. Many 
of the hooligans were older than the high school students, who insist 
the troublemakers have no connection to their movement. But the violence 
was also an indicator of deeper problems. High unemployment as well 
as school neglect in poor suburbs around Paris have been blamed for 
chronic and rising youth violence. Recent crippling strikes by transit 
drivers attacked by youths pay testament. Allegre faces a tough budget 
hold-down by a government under pressure to keep the budget deficit 
within 3 percent of the gross domestic product, as required by the 
euro single currency that takes effect at the end of the year.
