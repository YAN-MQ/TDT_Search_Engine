A veritable who's who in comedy turned out at the Kennedy center in 
washington last night to honor Richard pryor. The ground-breaking 
comedian received the first Mark Twain prize, honoring people who 
create humor from their uniquely American experiences. Comedian Damon 
wayans says pryor was "so rebellious" that he paved the way for comics 
to take on a wider range of subjects. Also attending were Robin Williams, 
Whoopi Goldberg, Chris rock, and Morgan freeman.
