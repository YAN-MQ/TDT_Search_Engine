Officials in southern Texas say the guadalupe river has finally crested 
today. It has covered hundreds of thousands of acres in an area stretching 
from san Antonio all the way to the gulf coast. 22 deaths are blamed 
on the flooding. Hundreds of homes are flooded, their residents forced 
to move to higher ground. The high waters have caused between $90 
million and $100 million in damage, and those estimates are expected 
to rise.
