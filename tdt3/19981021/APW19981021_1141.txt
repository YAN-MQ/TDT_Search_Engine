The Ariane 5 rocket, the most powerful in the European series of unmanned 
rockets, sailed into the heavens above South America Wednesday in 
a final test launch hailed as a success. The lift-off from its space 
base in Kourou, French Guiana, on the northern shoulder of South America, 
came at 13:37 p.m. local time (1637 GMT) -- well within the launch 
window despite a half-hour halt in the countdown. The successful third 
test of Ariane 5, powered with solid-propellant boosters, followed 
a failure in 1996 and a test last year that was only partially satisfactory. 
Just 31 minutes after lift-off, Flight 503 successfully simulated 
the launching, at an altitude of 1,500 kms (932 miles) of a mockup 
satellite that was part of its payload, the 2.6-ton MAGSAT 3. Arianespace, 
the commercial arm of the European Space Agency, said that Ariane 
5 ``left no doubts as to its ability to deliver payloads ....'' Confirming 
Ariane 5's capacity to lob satellites into geostationary transfer 
orbit was the prime goal of the test. The Ariane 5 also dropped a 
capsule with instruments to measure various functions. The capsule 
was to be recovered in the Pacific Ocean. ``Today Europe confirmed 
its lead in space transport systems for the 21st century,'' a statement 
by Arianespace said. French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister 
Lionel Jospin offered congratulations. The success ``will allow Arianespace 
to maintain its role as world leader in space transport,'' Jospin 
said in a statement. The first commercial flight of the new launcher 
is set for the first quarter of 1999. Current satellite launch capacity, 
using the less powerful Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 is now 12-15 launches 
a year until 2001, Arianespace said. European officials, 6th graf
