Members of the U.S. military are being told not to publicly criticize 
President Clinton. Military officials have warned that contemptuous 
words including rude jokes about the commander-in-chief and Monica 
Lewinsky could lead to disciplinary action. The warning follows two 
public criticisms by Marine corps office ares, one posted on the Internet 
and another written for "the Los Angeles times."
