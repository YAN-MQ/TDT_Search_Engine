NBC news "in depth." Tonight, going to extremes. When the weather 
goes haywire, what does it cost in lives and in dollars and cents? 
This past year has seen some of the wildest weather on record. So 
far, in the U.S., more than 1,200 tornadoes have struck. In addition, 
three hurricanes and three tropical storms have hit U.S. soil. And 
then there are the floods that have struck so many communities. Even 
tonight, towns in Texas are under water. Tonight, NBC's Robert Hager, 
"in depth," on the costs of this sea change in weather patterns. Damage 
from flooding in Texas put at nearly $500 million today. This afternoon, 
20 counties declared a federal disaster area. Police are still going 
door-to-door, warning people to evacuate. Homes and fields inundated. 
At least 22 dead, in what's only the most recent example of extreme 
weather, as the damage cost of natural disasters grows dramatically 
in recent years everywhere. Worldwide, from $5 billion to $10 billion 
a year back in the 1960s. A steady rise to more than $55 billion a 
year in the middle 1990s and again this year. Same trend in the U.S. 
-- nearly twice as many formal federal disaster declarations made 
per year in the 1990s, compared to the 1980s, just a Decade ago. Federal 
aid for disasters skyrocketing, too, from less than $500 million a 
Year through most of the 1980s to three or four times that much in 
the 1990s. The numbers, added up today, from consumer group pirg, 
public interest research group. People around the country are suffering. 
They are losing their homes, they're losing their businesses, and 
they are losing their job. In fact, the ten most costly natural disasters 
ever in the U.S. and its territories, all occurring within the last 
ten years. From hurricane Hugo in Charleston, back in 1989, to hurricane 
Andrew, in florida and Louisiana in 1992, right up to hurricane georges, 
in Puerto rico, Florida and the gulf coast, just last month. The former 
head of the U.S. weather service, elbert "Joe" Friday -- The amount 
of damage that we've had from severe weather activities over the last 
three or four years has really been astonishing. why? Many scientists 
believe that, in part, it's a result of warming global temperatures, 
which, in turn, loads the atmosphere with more moisture, and causes 
more storms to develop. But the high cost is also a result of more 
people living along the coast. As the number of people move into these 
more hazardous areas, the losses due to weather events will naturally 
increase. At a cost, ask Charlie quilter how much he and his wife 
lost when the rains of El Nino nearly swept away their California 
home. At least $50,000 in personal property of that sort. And to rebuild 
the house, maybe $750,000, or something like that. Ask the people 
of Texas about their problems. We're going to move to higher ground. 
Everyone is going to move to higher ground, man. But the storms keep 
coming and the toll keeps rising. The worst weather of winter still 
ahead. Robert Hager, NBC news, Washington.
