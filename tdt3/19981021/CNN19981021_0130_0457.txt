A new study shows the number of low-income students eating breakfast 
at school has nearly doubled in the last ten years. The food research 
and action council, a public interest group, reports that in 1988, 
3.1 million low-income students participated in the government-sponsored 
school breakfast program. By this year, the number increased 94%, 
to 6.1 million. The number of schools that offer the program also 
nearly doubled in that ten year period. Studies have shown children 
who eat breakfast perform better in school and have fewer behavioral 
problems.
