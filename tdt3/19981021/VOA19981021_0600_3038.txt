U.S. stocks Tuesday rose 39 points, a fifth straight increase, buoyed 
by Chase Manhattan and other major U.S. companies reporting better-than-expected 
earnings, spurring optimism the worst of the bear market is over. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opens for business today at 8,506. 
That's the first time the Dow has been above 8,500 since late August.
