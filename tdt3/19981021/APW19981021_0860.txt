Anna Kournikova double faulted 20 times in an upset loss to Silvia 
Farina in the Kremlin Cup Wednesday, bowing out to the angry whistles 
of her home crowd. The Moscow-born Kournikova dropped the first set 
6-7 (5-7) to Farina, of Italy. Sixth-seeded Kournikova clinched the 
second set 6-4 and lost the last set 1-6. It was Kournikova's first 
loss since early 1997 to a player ranked outside the world's top 15. 
A week ago in Zurich, the 17-year-old Russian committed 17 double 
faults to lose in the first round of the European Championships. Kournikova, 
who now lives and trains in Florida, dropped out of the top 10 after 
tearing ligaments in her right thumb. She is ranked 12th on the WTA 
tour. She wasn't the only seeded player to lose Wednesday. Chanda 
Rubin of the United States upset eighth-seed Irina Spirlea in straight 
sets 6-2, 6-3. In other matches, Sabine Appelmans beat Elena Dementieva 
6-4, 6-4. Fifth seeded Mary Pierce beat last year's Kremlin Cup runner-up 
Ai Sugiyama 5-7, 6-2, 6-4. Sandrine Testud, seeded seventh, beat French 
compatriot Nathalie Dechy 6-2, 6-2.
