Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe says Congo-Kinshasa's allies have 
agreed to mount an offensive in eastern Congo, where rebels control 
vast areas of land. President Mugabe made the announcement after strategy 
talks in Harare with the presidents of Angola and Namibia and a top 
official from Congo. Defense analysts say the move marks an escalation 
of the conflict that could spark a regional war in central Africa.
