State-run Jordan Television is considering using Hebrew subtitles 
on political programs to acquaint the Israeli public with the Jordanian 
perspective, officials said Wednesday. Abdul-Halim Arabiyat, director 
of JTV's news department, said no date has been set for starting the 
service whose feasibility and technical aspects were being studied. 
``We are thinking of Hebrew subtitles to our political programs, like 
debates on current affairs and talk shows,'' he told The Associated 
Press. Another TV official said the translations would aim at making 
Israelis aware of Jordanian views on such topics as the Mideast peace 
process. The translation will be done by Jordanian Hebrew speakers, 
the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity. During the 
state of war between the two neighbors over the last five decades, 
television signals from the two countries beamed across the frontier 
to reach audiences in most parts of Jordan and Israel. In the 1970s, 
Jordan introduced a news bulletin in Hebrew, also with the aim of 
presenting Jordanian political views. Similarly, Israeli TV still 
has a daily Arabic program meant for Palestinians as well as citizens 
of nearby Arab countries. Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel 
in 1994.
