Technology shares led the Nasdaq stock market sharply higher Wednesday, 
while blue-chip companies saw a far more mild rise. Paced by Microsoft, 
which rose 6 3/16, to 106 7/16, the Nasdaq composite index climbed 
2.17 percent, or 35.56 points, to 1,674.75. The Nasdaq index has surged 
18 percent in the last two weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average 
rose 13.38 points, to 8,519.23, posting its sixth consecutive advance. 
More of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow were down than up and the 
average, which spent much of the day in negative territory, would 
have ended lower without the contribution of IBM. Big Blue rose 4 
13/16 a share, to 142 11/16, after reporting a 10 percent increase 
in third-quarter profits late Tuesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock 
index rose 5.98 points, to 1,069.92. Several multibillion-dollar mergers 
announced recently _ the latest being the Newell Co.'s $5.8 billion 
deal for Rubbermaid _ have helped improve the climate on Wall Street 
lately, as has the re-emergence of credit for some borrowers. ``We're 
beginning to see some thawing out,'' said Peter Canelo, a domestic 
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``I think we've 
turned the corner on the panic.'' Canelo added that the options volatility 
index has registered distress in 23 of the latest 34 sessions, but 
none in the last week. Alan Ackerman, chief strategist at Fahnestock, 
said that ``mood, momentum and money-flow seem to be coming together'' 
in the markets, particularly for Nasdaq stocks. In many cases, he 
said, those still sell for ``a pittance'' relative to earnings. Some 
analysts suggested that the traditional year-end selling of battered 
stocks to establish losses for tax purposes seems to be occurring 
early this year, with bargain hunters already moving in to scoop up 
shares at their lowest prices. Stocks are also getting a lift from 
generally favorable third-quarter corporate earnings, which have slightly 
surpassed expectations. ``We're seeing some pretty good numbers coming 
in,'' said Mary Farrell, senior strategist at Paine Webber. ``The 
important thing is that the market continues in positive territory 
_ it's holding.'' Treasury bond prices, which have been highly volatile 
for months as many investors sought a safe haven from equities, were 
little changed Wednesday though issues of two years or less sagged 
enough to bump rates up by several basis points. Bond analysts said 
the market is anticipating further interest-rate cuts by the Federal 
Reserve. Technology stocks, which dominate the Nasdaq index, were 
once again the standout performers among equities. Dell Computer rose 
3|, to 56 15/16, Cisco Systems climbed 3{, to 57 5/8, and Intel jumped 
2 1/2, to 87 1/16. PeopleSoft, though, dropped 6, to 19 3/4, following 
the company's projection of slower sales next year. Among blue chips, 
drug stocks were strong, with shares of Merck, Eli Lilly, Schering-Plough, 
Warner-Lambert, American Home Products gaining more than 2 points 
each. But airline shares, prominently those in United Airlines, were 
lower. UAL, the parent of United, fell 3 7/16, to 62 15/16.
