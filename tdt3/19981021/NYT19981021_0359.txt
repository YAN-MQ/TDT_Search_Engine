Carlos Alazraqui was just a comic from Los Angeles doing voice-overs 
on the side when he got that fateful call in July 1997. It was his 
agent. ``She said, `You're playing the voice of a dog for Taco Bell,' 
'' he recalled. ``I said, `All right.' '' And so, history was made. 
Or at least voice acting history. Alazraqui, 36, a second-generation 
Argentine-American, became the man behind the talking Chihuahua in 
Taco Bell's attention-grabbing commercials. He joined a growing list 
of voice actors who earn hundreds of thousands _ even millions _ of 
dollars a year without ever having to set face on a screen. ``I think, 
`Wow, how lucky I am,' '' said Alazraqui, whose parents emigrated 
from Argentina in the '50s. ``It's stupid money,'' he added, alluding 
to being paid so much for saying ``Yo quiero Taco Bell'' while a jug-eared 
female pooch named Gidget appears to lip-sync the words of desire 
for the fast-food chain. With or without megabucks, voice acting has 
certain intangible attractions. ``I like being famous and anonymous,'' 
said Lorenzo Music, aka Garfield the cartoon cat and the talking crash 
test dummy in those public service ads warning you to buckle up. ``I 
can walk down the street and nobody comes up to me.'' Moreover, neither 
looks nor age matters. ``Some of the sexiest-voiced actresses, you 
wouldn't want to see,'' said Jeffrey Hedquist, a former deejay turned 
voice actor. Alazraqui refused to say precisely how far into six figures 
he earns, but he is clearly not the top-paid voice in his field. That 
distinction probably falls to someone like Don LaFontaine, a full-throated 
Los Angeles actor repeatedly heard saying things like ``Next week 
on `E.R.' '' on television. ``I make millions,'' LaFontaine, 58, said 
in a phone interview. Though a handful of star voices have always 
earned big money, both the money and the number of actors chasing 
it have exploded in the last 5 to 10 years, according to those in 
the business. Meanwhile, advances in technology have helped the most 
popular voice stars bite off a bigger chunk of the business. ``They're 
coming by busloads with doctorates in voice acting,'' Music said. 
``I think people figured it out.'' But he added a key point: ``Of 
all the people who are calling themselves voice actors and doing voice 
acting, not all are making a living at it yet. Most people supplement 
other income with voice acting.'' Indeed, while thousands of actors 
are chasing voice acting jobs, most of the work is split among no 
more than 100 actors, said Dick Moore, spokesman for the American 
Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represents 80,000 
actors, news broadcasters and other radio and television performers 
around the country. Still, when jobs are won, the money is good and 
it can take only minutes to earn it, compared with the hours an actor 
might spend on an on-screen appearance, Moore explained. Unknown applicants 
have to troop to studios and audition each time a potential job pops 
up, and this and callbacks can require a lot of time. But some known 
voices do not even have to audition. Music, 61, said of the time he 
needs to make a commercial in a studio: ``It takes maybe a half-hour. 
That includes schmoozing and donuts.'' To read the script, nail down 
the lines with guidance from a producer and create a usable tape, 
he said, ``takes maybe 10 to 15 minutes on-mike time.'' For that, 
Music might get $500 to $750 for each radio spot, or more if the commercial 
is made for a national network program, plus the same amount all over 
again each additional 13 weeks. ``You can tape one thing and it can 
play for 10 years,'' he said. While Aftra scale is $200 a session 
for a radio spot, it is common for popular voice actors to negotiate 
two or three times that or to get a contract for far more, he said. 
In addition, money is added to the base rate when the commercial is 
to be played in major cities. In Los Angeles, the going rate for voice 
actors is $350 a session, according to Bob Lloyd, owner of the Voicecaster, 
a casting concern in Burbank, Calif. TV sessions are $359.95 under 
Aftra scale but go as high as $707.40 in New York, with spots made 
for network television paying extra each time they are broadcast. 
The incomes of voice actors have risen along with network budgets, 
Moore explained. He also pointed out that this is a business in which 
advertisers are willing to spend hundreds of thousands or even a million 
to lure big-name screen actors to be the unseen voice of their product, 
believing a familiar sound will snap consumers to attention. In his 
later years, Robert Mitchum was the voice for the beef industry and 
Oppenheimer, the brokerage firm. Dick Cavett did commercials for, 
among others, AT&AMP;T. Richard Dreyfuss was the unseen voice behind 
certain previous Apple Computer ads and is now the voice behind some 
Honda commercials. Stars once turned up their noses at such jobs but 
now, ``I think there's a realization that there's no shame in doing 
commercials,'' Moore said. At the same time, new kinds of audio work 
have opened up, with books on tape and readings for the blind. And 
shows like ``The Simpsons'' have led to a resurgence in animation, 
with a need for voices. ``Business has just boomed,'' Music said. 
Technology has also brought higher earnings _ for some. New, ultra-clear 
integrated services digital network, or ISDN, phone lines mean that 
a voice actor can be directed and even recorded by a producer at another 
site. That means voice actors can live anywhere and still perform, 
said Hedquist, who moved from the Northeast to Fairfield, Iowa, to 
live among followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and transcendental 
meditation. Some top voice actors have ISDN lines in their home, he 
said. The overall effect, however, has been to concentrate business 
in the vocal cords of a few dozen actors in New York and Los Angeles 
rather than to spread out the work. If the talent can be in a backwater 
town, so can the ad agency or production house that decides it wants 
to use big-city talent rather than the local guy. ``Twenty years ago, 
I used to use a lot of Dallas talent,'' said Poppy Sundeen, a Dallas 
writer and producer who creates broadcast commercials. ``Now, a lot 
of the time I will just cast someone in L.A. or New York, and I don't 
even think about the Dallas talent.'' Music produced such sitcom hits 
as ``The Bob Newhart Show'' and ``Rhoda'' before becoming a voice. 
He credits himself with helping to usher in a more natural sound. 
Starting in the '70s as the voice of Carlton the Doorman on ``Rhoda,'' 
he expanded into other roles after an agent told him he could make 
money with his throat. ``I made the transition from being a big-time 
Hollywood mogul to being a voice actor,'' he dead-panned in his laconic 
Garfield voice. The move toward more natural voices is such that although 
radio deejays used to do a lot of the ads, having a producer find 
out you are a radio announcer now can be ``the kiss of death,'' said 
Hedquist, who started out as a deejay 36 years ago. There is also 
a move away from the resonant, older male voice to younger men and 
to women, said Jim Kennelly, owner of Lotas Productions, a New York 
company that provides voice talent for radio and TV voice-overs. In 
the mid 1980s, the Woman's Voice-Over Committee of the New York branch 
of the Screen Actors Guild complained that 80 percent to 90 percent 
of all voice-over work was being done by men. It commissioned a study 
that showed that women could also be effective voices. More women 
are being used now, Hedquist said, although men still dominate the 
business. A 1995 study showed that 75 percent of voice-overs were 
done by men, said Rafe Greenlee, of the Screen Actors Guild, which 
represents film actors as well as some performers on TV and commercials. 
Younger men _ especially those with voice attitude _ have gained as 
advertisers reach out to Generation Xers. One of the hottest voices 
today belongs to a young New Yorker named Paul Christie, who plays 
the wise-guy lizard on the popular Budweiser beer commercials. The 
lizard, through his agent, refused to talk. Budweiser's lizards and 
frogs croak only in character, said Bill Etling, spokesman for Anheuser-Busch 
Inc., the company that makes the beer. The brewery wants the humans 
behind Louie, Frank, Bud, Weis and Er to remain anonymous, he said. 
Of course, some voices never go out of style. The deep-throated growl 
of Thurl Ravenscroft, an 84-year-old voice actor and singer, is still 
going strong for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes after 46 years. Ravenscroft 
said he moved from Nebraska to California in the '30s, hoping to become 
a set designer or interior decorator but was sidetracked into singing 
for commercials and _ off camera _ in movies. Through the years he 
has been heard as the soloist in ``Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole 
Christmas,'' the Russian wolfhound in ``Lady and the Tramp'' and a 
mouse in ``Cinderella.'' He snared the role of Tony the Tiger because 
Kellogg Co. knew him from his singing in another of its commercials. 
He still remembers the day in 1952 when he went to a studio to make 
the first Tony the Tiger spot. According to the script, he recalled, 
``Tony would say, `Good? Why they're great' '' _ but in a regular 
voice. ``I said we had to do something with the word `great' _ to 
make it explode _ to make it special.'' And voice acting history was 
made.
