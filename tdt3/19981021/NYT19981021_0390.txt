New details of surprises hidden in the $500 billion federal budget 
deal emerged Wednesday as the Senate passed the bill and President 
Clinton signed it into law. These included $750,000 for grasshopper 
research in Alaska, $250,000 for a lettuce geneticist in Salinas, 
Calif., and $1.1 million for manure handling and disposal in Starkville, 
Miss. Bee researchers in Baton Rouge, La., are to receive $300,000, 
and Maine researchers get $220,000 to study low-bush blueberries. 
Eight states will divide more than $5 million to research the uses 
of wood. New York state is to receive $550,000 to restore the home 
of Susan B. Anthony. Colorado Springs gets $800,000 to reconstruct 
the Pikes Peak Summit House. And Glacier Bay National Park will open 
up to commercial fishing. These elements are tucked into the 40-pound 
pork-laden spending bill that Congress sent to the president Wednesday. 
The House passed the omnibus package on Tuesday night, 333-95, and 
the Senate passed it Wednesday, 65-29, closing out the 105th Congress. 
As in the House, the Republicans in the Senate were unhappy with the 
final package. Of the 29 senators who opposed the bill, 20 were Republicans. 
Supporting it were 33 Republicans and 32 Democrats. One of the angriest 
senators was John McCain, R-Ariz., who compiled a 52-page list of 
``objectionable items'' in the bill, which was finally printed in 
Wednesday's Congressional Record. McCain was especially incensed that 
in the $9 billion of emergency spending for defense, the bill ignored 
the military's top priority _ an increase in retirement benefits. 
He also took strong issue with Speaker Newt Gingrich's characterization 
Tuesday night of conservative opponents of the bill as ``perfectionists'' 
who did not understand compromise. He said that with its squandering 
of the surplus on parochial, pork-barrel projects, the Republican-controlled 
Congress had produced a budget that did not reflect the party's principles. 
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., asked: ``Where is the leadership? Where 
is the agenda? What are we trying to accomplish?'' Democratic opponents 
included Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who said the bill reflected 
an ``ominously careless'' breakdown in procedure, and Sen. Robert 
Byrd, D-W.Va., who said on Tuesday that he would hold his nose and 
vote for it. ``I made such a good speech last night that I convinced 
myself to vote against it,'' Byrd said Wednesday. He called the final 
package ``an elephantine monstrosity,'' adding, ``There's no living 
person who knows everything that's in this bill.'' The final package 
pumps billions of new dollars into the military and provides relief 
for the nation's farmers. But any bill of this magnitude _ it encompasses 
eight of the 13 broad spending categories of the federal government 
_ is likely to provide something for everyone, and this bill does. 
No institution honors its own the way the Senate does. The bill provides 
$1.2 million for the Mitch McConnell Conservation Fund, in honor of 
the Republican senator from Kentucky, $12 million for the Patrick 
Leahy War Victims Fund, in honor of the Democratic senator from Vermont, 
and $1.5 million for the Claiborne Pell Institute for International 
Relations, named for the former Democratic senator from Rhode Island. 
Paul Simon, the former Democratic senator from Illinois, gets a $1 
million library at Southern Illinois University. The bill also sets 
aside $6 million for the Robert Dole Institute of Public Service and 
Policy at the University of Kansas, named for the former majority 
leader and 1996 Republican presidential nominee. The bill is larded 
with education programs and water and energy projects for virtually 
every congressional district. It directs millions of dollars for courthouse 
construction across the country, including $153 million for a federal 
courthouse in Brooklyn, in New York City. And in allocations where 
no specific site is specified, one is suggested, such as a $750,000 
project monitoring abuse of the elderly, a project that the bill ``encourages'' 
to be conducted in Pennsylvania. Georgia, Gingrich's home state, reaped 
millions of dollars for special-interest projects in addition to the 
billions for new military aircraft to be built by Lockheed Martin 
in Marietta, the speaker's home town. The final package provides for 
$1 million for peanut research in Georgia, $64,000 for urban pest 
research in Georgia, and $100,000 for Vidalia onion research in Georgia. 
Gingrich was also able to help the peanut growers in his state by 
thwarting a Department of Transportation regulation that would have 
created a ``peanut-free zone'' on domestic air flights. The regulation 
would have barred the distribution of peanuts within three rows of 
anyone who is allergic to peanuts. In a reflection of the round-the-clock 
haggling and last-minute reversals that have marked much of this bill, 
one item was suddenly opened again even after the Senate sent the 
bill to the White House. This was a provision that denied a tax exemption 
on the $1 million reward paid to David Kaczynski, who turned in his 
brother, Theodore, in the Unabomber case. David Kaczynski, who lives 
near Schenectady, N.Y., has received the reward. He has spent $250,000 
of it on legal fees, which included persuading the Justice Department 
not to seek the death penalty for his brother. He wants to distribute 
the remaining $750,000, which is in a bank account, to his brother's 
victims and their families. When David Kaczynski learned he would 
owe about $350,000 in taxes on the original reward, he contacted Moynihan, 
who has been seeking the tax exemption since September. Moynihan said 
David Kaczynski was trying to perform ``a selfless act of humanity.'' 
The chief opponent of the exemption is Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Archer believes that the 
exemption would set a bad precedent in opening the tax code for a 
special provision without a public hearing, according to Archer's 
press secretary, Sean Rushton. Nonetheless, after the Senate approved 
the omnibus spending bill Wednesday, it passed by voice vote a free-standing 
bill to give Kaczynski the tax break. The Senate sent the proposal 
to the House, but Rushton said the House, most of whose members have 
fled the Capitol, would not take up the Senate bill, sothe issue was 
dead for the year.
