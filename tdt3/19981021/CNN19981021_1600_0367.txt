Authorities in Cuero, Texas, say area schools are housing one-quarter 
of the town's 7,000 residents. The flooded guadalupe river is up to 
two miles wide, and people are using boats to get around. The city 
of Victoria has also been inundated. Officials say it's the worst 
flooding since 1936. The mayor of Victoria says getting back to normal 
is the first priority. As we're able to go in with the utility people 
and make sure that the electricity is safe, the utilities -- gas, 
natural gas and other things -- we'll be trying to release areas as 
the water goes down in grids or in sections to the citizens to let 
the citizens know what -- I know they want to get back in and see 
their property, but it's going to be a while yet. The flooding has 
affected blood donation operations in the area. Health officials want 
volunteers to make up for the shortfall.
