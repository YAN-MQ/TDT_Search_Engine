A Japanese businessman who paid a hefty price for a stuffed animal 
says it was well worth it. He bought a Teddy bear for $100,000 at 
an auction in New York yesterday. It's believed to be the most expensive 
bear ever sold. The bear is a one-of-A-kind created by gund manufacturers 
to celebrate its 100th anniversary in the toy-making business. The 
bear will go to Japan with its new owner and be on display at a Teddy 
bear museum.
