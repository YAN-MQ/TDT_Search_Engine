No matter what kind of tiles you buy, the excitement dies hard if 
they go up on the wall looking like your first set of teeth, with 
toothpaste smeared fatly across the front. No one doubts tiling can 
be poorly done, especially veterans of their own attempts. ``When 
I started out 18 years ago, my first 40 calls were repairs,'' said 
Stephen Spretnjak, a New York artist and tile worker. ``I learned 
how to tile by going over somebody's mistakes.'' Spretnjak did the 
tiling at Balthazar, the SoHo bistro, and Pravda, the downtown vodka 
bar, which included a hammer and sickle mosaic. You may not be doing 
the installation yourself, but you can be aware of how a conscientious 
tile worker approaches the job, whether using ceramic, stone or glass 
tiles, in a bathroom or kitchen. Like any adept, Spretnjak has his 
priorities and his preferences, as he demonstrated on a recent assignment: 
a 300-square-foot steam room being constructed in a commercial loft 
on Canal Street, which he is tiling with white, three-inch-by-six-inch 
subway tile. The first concern is the wall. If an existing wall is 
being tiled, make necessary repairs, most experts advise. Don't expect 
tiles to conceal damage; they will fall off. If a new wall is being 
built, as with Spretnjak's steam room, make sure the contractor uses 
cement board, which is a fiberglass mesh board imbedded with cement 
that is waterproof _ much more so than standard plaster wallboard. 
Spretnjak also specifies galvanized screws for attaching it to the 
wall studs; Sheetrock screws rust and fail if moisture finds its way 
inside the wall. Old or new, the prepared wall must be absolutely 
level and flat before the first tile goes up. ``No dips, no indentures,'' 
Spretnjak said. ``I take the tile adhesive, or mud, as it's called, 
and smooth out the surface with a big board like it's a plaster wall.'' 
Before you have tile installed, inspect it, to make sure colors, shading 
or veining are what you want. Charles Pearl, a tileworker who was 
completing a 100-square-foot shower enclosure last week in an apartment 
on Fifth Avenue, recommended that the installer also make a close 
inspection, ``to make sure that you can actually work with it.'' Pearl 
was using 18-inch-square marble tiles. How many tiles to buy? Calculate 
the square footage of the space, dividing by the size of the tile. 
Then add 10 percent to 20 percent. You will lose tiles because of 
breakage caused by cutting and because of unusable short ends. If 
you're including a diagonal pattern in your design, add 25 percent 
because of the greater number of cuts. It is impossible to find exact 
replacements. ``This is the thing about tiles, even white,'' said 
Roger Nelson, the general contractor on Spretnjak's steam room. ``When 
you get a patch job, you can never match them. It's a horror story.'' 
Traditionally, tile was adhered with a mud-set, a thick patty of cement. 
A generation of thin-sets, which are lighter, epoxy adhesives developed 
in the 1950s, has largely replaced mud-sets, with equal effectiveness, 
Spretnjak said. He combs it onto a wall with a notched trowel, and 
then begins applying the tile. ``Start from the bottom up,'' he said. 
``Gravity forces down.'' When he is two-thirds of the way up a wall, 
Spretnjak stops to take account of how it will finish. ``I'm going 
to be very concerned about what kind of cut I'll have to make at the 
top, because it's the most visible,'' he said. ``If I know I'm going 
to be an inch or two short of a full tile at the top, then I consider 
a band of decorative trim about a third of the way down, or a molding 
trim.'' Spretnjak also installs glass mosaic tile, though the process 
requires its own precautions and patience. ``It's little bits that 
reflect light,'' he said. ``When 13th-century tile workers were doing 
a basilica and they had a saint to be lit by torchlight, they would 
angle the mosaic glass of the eyes and the hands so that when the 
light hit, it would reflect and look more real.'' Not an effect you 
want when you're showering. To avoid an uneven set to the surface, 
Spretnjak lays the tile into the thin-set, tamping and smoothing it 
flatly with a broad wooden float, ``not your fingers,'' he said, which 
push individual tiles into the thin-set unevenly. Larger four-inch-square 
glass tiles also run their own risks, and a higher installation cost. 
``You have to butter the back of each tile carefully with thin-set,'' 
said Daniel Bonpietro, a tileworker installing tile with Pearl on 
Fifth Avenue, ``so you don't see the tooth marks the trowel makes 
in the thin-set on the wall. You'd see those parallel lines right 
through the glass.'' Laying the tile is half the battle. ``Grouting's 
the big frustration,'' Spretnjak said of the epoxy that fills the 
thin gaps between the tiles. After the tile has set for a recommended 
16 to 24 hours, the grout is applied in strokes across the wall, with 
a rubber float that works like a squeegee to push it into the gaps 
while skimming it cleanly from the surface of the tiles. That's the 
theory. Grout allowed to dry where it shouldn't _ on, say, the shiny 
face of a tile _ is there to stay without hard work to remove it. 
Colored grouts, available in dozens of shades, can approximate a tile 
color, subtly disappearing, or create a vivid counterpoint. The drawback: 
like tiles, they can be hard to match in a repair. Regularity is the 
goal. But not always uniformity. Monotony is tile's biggest occupational 
hazard. David Ling, a New York architect, employed glass mosaic tile 
in a recent apartment project to sheathe the undulating form of a 
wall in a deep, midnight blue. Ling chose hand-poured, hand-cut Brazilian 
Vidrotil-brand glass tiles _ available at Hastings Tile, 230 Park 
Avenue South (19th Street) _ for their artistic irregularity and fluid 
top relief. He also instructed the installer to interrupt and widen 
the gridded spacing of the tiles with the knife of his trowel, at 
random intervals, as the thin-set dried, to create a gentle, schooled 
swim in the pattern of the wall's surface. At what price perfection 
_ whether studiously casual or conventionally square? Based on square 
footage, time involved and the labor required for the number and difficulty 
of cuts in the tiles, Pearl offered an estimate on his 100-square-foot 
marble shower, with several built-in shelves and a small tiled seat: 
$1,500. This excluded the cost of the tiles and any construction or 
preparation of the underlying wall. For standard ceramic tile, the 
price would drop. For stone tile like limestone, which requires sealing, 
the price would rise. Setting irregular tiles also adds to the cost. 
Glass _ the most expensive scenario _ could drive the price up an 
additional $1,000, Pearl said. For a simple 300-square-foot space 
like the steam room, Spretnjak offered an estimate of $2,000. As in 
any renovation, invite bids from at least three tiling professionals. 
``If somebody is high, ask him to explain why,'' Pearl said. ``But 
avoid really cheap jobs. You'll get one. Choose someone who's going 
to refuse stupid economies, like using Sheetrock in a shower instead 
of cement board. There's a lot of money involved, and it should come 
out looking like that.''
