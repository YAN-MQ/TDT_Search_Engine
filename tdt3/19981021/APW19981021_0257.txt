As Olympic medalists, Australian rower Kate Slatter and swimmer Daniel 
Kowalski could be expected to be resting on their laurels or training 
for their next competitions. Instead, along with paraplegic shot putter 
Hamish MacDonald, they are serving this week as special ambassadors, 
visiting two refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodia border where thousands 
live without the simple joy of sport. Their mission is a joint initiative 
by the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees to use sport to raise awareness of the struggle 
for human dignity around the world. It is the first such venture in 
the run-up to the Olympics in Sydney in 2000. The refugees at Phu 
Noi camp fled their homes in May. They had been living in a pocket 
of northern Cambodia controlled by the notoriously harsh Khmer Rouge 
guerrilla movement. A government offensive swept them across the Thai 
border. Today, the camp houses more than 15,000 people. With continuing 
political instability in their homeland, it's not known when they 
will return. In this tightly disciplined camp, organized fun is unknown. 
But the athletes received an enthusiastic welcome Tuesday, although 
it took several minutes before the children overcame their shyness. 
Slatter, 26, won a gold medal in rowing pairs at the 1996 Olympics. 
She said she found her visit an emotional and revealing experience. 
``They're just people like you and me,'' she said. ``They're just 
trying to get by from day to day, and find a way to enjoy life. They 
love seeing each other play sport, and just get amongst it.'' A doctor 
from the Australian state of Tasmania who has worked in the camp almost 
since it opened knows how special the visit is for the refugees. ``They 
live from day to day,'' said Frances Daily. ``They aren't allowed 
to roam freely, do what they like, so for most of them their lives 
are on hold.'' Many refugees are disabled. Land mines from decades 
of war have taken their toll. So the presence of Hamish MacDonald, 
who won a gold medal in the Atlanta Paraplegic Olympics, was meant 
to convey a message of hope. ``In the future there are other opportunities 
for them, despite their predicament,' he said. ``If I can leave them 
with that impression, then that's a positive thing.'' At Huay Cherng 
camp, home to 7,000 people, the reception was just as warm. ``They're 
out there, they're playing together, they're having a lot of fun and 
it's brought a smile to their faces, and I remember saying before 
I left if I can just bring a smile to one of their faces then the 
trip's been worthwhile, and we've had hundreds of smiles today and 
that's great,'' said swimmer Kowalski, a star of the Olympic and Commonwealth 
Games. A 13-year-old boy playing with a donated soccer ball agreed. 
``This is great,'' said Nee. `` In Cambodia we can't do this. We don't 
have things like this to play with.'' With their firsthand knowledge 
of the refugees' situation, the athlete-ambassadors will try to use 
their standing to generate awareness of refugee issues among the general 
public, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
