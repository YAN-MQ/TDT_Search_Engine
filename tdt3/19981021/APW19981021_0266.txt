The opposition alliance that won Slovakia's elections last month is 
pushing to reschedule Nov. 13-14 nationwide municipal balloting for 
a few weeks later, media reports said Wednesday. Opposition leaders 
are against holding the municipal vote, scheduled long ago by the 
outgoing government of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, during the 
country's political transition period. The alliance won't take power 
until after Oct. 29 when the newly elected Slovak Parliament convenes. 
Its leaders are already preparing electoral law amendments in order 
to postpone the mayoral elections, the campaign for which officially 
began Monday. ``We think that the elections have to be rescheduled. 
We will try for an early date, maybe even in December,'' Pavol Hamzik, 
vice chairman of the opposition Party of Civic Understanding, told 
reporters Tuesday. Ivan Simko, a member of the leadership of the largest 
opposition party, the Slovak Democratic Coalition, said it will be 
impossible for elections to take place on schedule.
