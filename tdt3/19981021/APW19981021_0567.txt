The United States on Wednesday told the European Union it would impose 
trade sanctions next year unless the Europeans reform their banana 
import regime to its satisfaction. ``We feel like we have been rebuffed,'' 
said U.S. trade representative Rita Hayes told a news conference after 
a WTO meeting. European Union officials warned that if the sanctions 
are imposed, the EU would react ``very strongly.'' ``If that's the 
way the Americans are going to go, there is going to be a major explosion,'' 
EU trade representative Roderick Abbott said, without specifying what 
action the Europeans would take. The threats and counter threats represent 
perhaps the most bitter exchanges yet in a long-running trade war 
over the EU's controversial banana policy. The European Union approved 
new import regulations after the United States and five Latin American 
banana producing nations complained to the WTO that previous EU regulations 
discriminate against them in favor of the EU's traditional banana 
suppliers in former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean. A WTO dispute 
panel backed the complaint and told the EU to modify its regime. The 
Europeans have until Jan. 1 to comply with the banana ruling. The 
European Union say the changes they have made to their policy bring 
it into line with WTO regulations. But the United States and Latin 
Americans claim it is still discriminatory. Earlier this month and 
under pressure from Congress, the Clinton administration published 
a letter outlining possible retaliation against the European Union 
if it refuses to make further changes to its policy satisfactory to 
the United States, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Panama. 
After going through a process of public comment, the administration 
will announce on Dec. 15 its plans for retaliatory action, a White 
House official said. If the EU doesn't comply, those sanctions would 
go into effect no later than March 3. WTO rules state that countries 
can take temporary measures such as requesting compensation and suspending 
trade concessions if WTO recommendations and rulings are not enforced 
in a set period of time. At a news conference, EU trade representative 
Roderick Abbott branded as ``nonsense'' U.S. claims that the Europeans 
had failed to properly implement the dispute settlement body's rulings. 
Unilateral action such as that proposed by the United States would 
be illegal and completely unacceptable, he said. The United States 
and Latin Americans claim the European import rules discriminate against 
them via a complex system of tariffs, quotas and import licenses. 
They have said the EU regime is costing more efficient producers hundreds 
of millions of dollars in lost trade.
