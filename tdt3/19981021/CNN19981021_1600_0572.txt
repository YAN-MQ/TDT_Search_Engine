A court case in south Africa is raising questions about the treatment 
of endangered wild animals on private game farms. Mike Hanna reports 
the decision could have a wide impact. In a small south African courthouse, 
a case that could have international consequences. Being decided by 
a local magistrate -- what constitutes cruel treatment of wild animals 
in captivity. Animal welfare organizations allege that the treatment 
of these 30 young elephants at a nearby game farm is unacceptable. 
The magistrate, Herman glass, conducted an on-site inspection Monday. 
Wildlife experts who'd visited the farm in previous days claim the 
owner had removed the tethers and chains from many of the animals 
before the arrival of the legal officer. I would have to think that 
the act has been substantially cleaned up because of the presence 
of media and all these folk here today. They haven't got a clue. Yep, 
completely cruel. When I came here on Saturday, they were all hobbled, 
chained. There were several of them chained over here against the 
fence. Couldn't even reach the food. Couldn't reach the water. What 
right have we got to do it to these animals who live three score years 
and ten, that are known to have an emotional makeup that's very similar 
to our own, and very stable bonds with the family, a sense of death, 
that feel emotions just like we do? Sensitive, caring creatures. Lawyers 
for the owner of the game farm strongly deny mistreatment of the animals. 
They argue, too, that the whole process, from capture to sale of the 
elephants, is in accordance with the convention for trade in endangered 
species -- ctes. It's up to the south African magistrate to rule on 
the cruelty charges, but it's the international community that will 
have to deal with questions this case raises about the management 
of elephant populations that are burgeoning in many parts of the world.
