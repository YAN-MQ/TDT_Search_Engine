Former Communist Party and state officials and those who worked for 
the regime's secret police will be banned from taking office in the 
state administration in the next 5 years under a law Bulgaria's parliament 
passed Wednesday. The chamber voted 133-79 to adopt the ban. Deputies 
of the Socialist Party of renamed communists said it violated human 
rights and boycotted the rest of the session. The Socialists said 
they would ask the Constitutional Court to throw out the ban. The 
12-judge court is empowered to revoke legislation. The law takes effect 
a month after President Petar Stoyanov signs it. It was not immediately 
known how Stoyanov would react. He can suspend enactment and ask parliament 
to review it as he did with two previous laws on radio and TV and 
on a judiciary reform. But parliament can override suspension, and 
then only the court is able to invalidate the legislation. ``The aim 
(of the law) is to create a depoliticized and responsible state administration,'' 
Minister of State Administration Mario Tagarinski said. He said the 
law would separate the political from nonpolitical part of the administration 
and guarantee that the latter won't be replaced with every change 
of government. ``If somebody causes a road accident he is deprived 
of his driving license for some time,'' Tagarinski told Socialist 
lawmakers in parliament. ``You used to run a whole state which badly 
crashed.'' The law is a centerpiece of a public service reform that 
the government is implementing to finally break with Bulgaria's communist 
past. Paying lip service to democracy and market economy, the former 
communists have dominated most ot Bulgaria's governments after ousting 
late strongman Todor Zhivkov in a party coup in 1989. Mismanagement 
and rampant crime and corruption brought Bulgaria to the brink of 
economic collapse in early 1997.
