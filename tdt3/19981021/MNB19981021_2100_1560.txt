A dramatic rescue at sea took place today off the southern costover 
England. Dozens of people were brought to safety, but it took a while, 
some of them by helicopter using a winch after a Dutch-registered 
sailing vessel suffered an engine failure and ran aground on a sand 
bar. Rain and fog made it difficult for the rescue crews, but everybody 
on board eventually managed to escape without significant injury. 
The dramatic pictures there today from the northern atlantic.
