The Yankees are reaching for the broom. I'm Anthony Keith James, and 
this is "Headline Sports." If the Yankees have their way, tonight 
could be the final game of the world series. The padres, trailing 
three games to none in the best of seven, will send kevin brown to 
the hill, as he tries to extended San Diego's season. New York tries 
to close out a sweep behind Andy pettitte. You know, you just try 
to get out there and see what you have, and hopefully, you know, I 
have good stuff. I'm just going to try to keep the ball down. Our 
backs are to the wall. We know that. So, the only thing we can do 
now is just go out there and, like I said, play our hearts out.
