We all expect the red cross to be there when disaster strikes. But 
ABC's Ron Claiborne reports tonight that in the wake of hurricane 
georges the red cross has a special problem. Even before hurricane 
georges finished blasting Puerto Rico, the red cross was there, as 
it always is helping people. It turned out to be the most expensive 
relief effort in its history, draining the red cross' financial reserves. 
How much would you like to donate today? Before georges, the red cross 
had $88 million in its disaster relief fund, most of it donated by 
individual Americans. The cost of helping the 400,000 victims of georges 
is expected to exceed $100 million. As soon as hurricane georges hit 
Puerto Rico, even before it reached the florida keys, the red cross 
realized that it would very soon be low on money. It immediately began 
a campaign to raise $50 million, and at first money poured in. But 
then suddenly, the donations slowed down, short of the goal. Red cross 
officials say Americans may have been less generous because it was 
Puerto Rico, not the mainland U.S., that suffered the worst damage. 
Red cross President Elizabeth Dole put it this way. It's not as much 
in people's minds that's in the next state or in their own backyard. 
However, one red cross official said privately the difficulty in raising 
funds was a matter of nearsightedness rather than racism. Red cross 
officials point out that Puerto Rico faded from the news almost as 
quickly as the storm did. And that, they say, is part of the problem. 
Like any organization appealing to public generosity, the red cross 
needs people to know that a disaster in Puerto Rico is an American 
disaster, just as worthy of Americans' help as any disaster in the 
mainland. Ron Claiborne, ABC News, Miami.
