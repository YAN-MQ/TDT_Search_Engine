New techniques may improve the chances of successful bone marrow transplants 
in cancer victims who do not have good tissue matches with donors. 
Marrow transplants are a potentially lifesaving treatment of last 
resort for some victims of leukemia and other types of cancer. However, 
about one-quarter of patients who might benefit cannot have transplants 
because doctors are unable to find a closely matched donor. Without 
a good match of tissue types, the transplant is likely to fail, often 
because the patient's body attacks the foreign marrow. Now, doctors 
from the University of Perugia in Italy and the Weizmann Institute 
in Rehovot, Israel, report a potential way around this in a study 
in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The new 
method, described by Dr. Franco Aversa, appears to offer a reasonable 
chance of success among those in whom only a partial match can be 
found. It is based on giving patients much larger than usual doses 
of donated marrow. The donor receives growth hormone that trigger 
the release of large numbers of marrow cells into the bloodstream. 
These cells are then strained from the donors' blood. The marrow is 
cleansed to remove blood cells that can trigger a misguided attack 
by the body's immune system. After 18 months, 12 of the 43 patients 
treated this way were alive and free of disease. However, doctors 
cautioned that rebuilding of the patients' immune systems was poor, 
and infections were a common cause of death. In another report in 
the journal, Dr. Takehiko Sasazuki of Kyushu University in Fukuoka, 
Japan, reported a way of fine-tuning donor matching using genetic 
analysis. Their report showed that matching up some of the genes that 
control the immune system are especially important. They said that 
this more in-depth matching of donor and recipient can improve the 
success rate, even when the two sides would ordinarily be considered 
to have identical tissue types. In an accompanying editorial, Jon 
J. van Rood and Machteld Oudshoorn of Leiden University Medical Center 
in the Netherlands said the studies are milestones in marrow transplantation. 
``It is equally clear,'' they wrote, ``that many other milestones 
will have to be passed before not only all patients have donors, but 
also all are cured.''
