Two unique new margarines will be in supermarkets next year. Elizabeth 
Cohen looks at what they could do to your cholesterol levels. Scientists 
have taken chemicals, found naturally in fruits and vegetables, and 
added them to margarine. The result -- two new margarines, due out 
early next year in stores in the United States, have been found to 
lower cholesterol levels. The new margarines will come at a higher 
price. The cholesterol-lowering chemicals are called "plant stanol 
esters." They exist in small amounts in fruits and vegetables. Scientists 
altered the stanol esters and put large amounts of them into the new 
margarines. One of the new margarines is called benecol. It's already 
available in Finland. Dr. Lowell Dale has studied it. What it does 
is it binds up that cholesterol and prevents it from being absorbed. 
Studies show it lowers the levels of ldl cholesterol -- that's the 
bad cholesterol -- by an average of 14% when people eat it three times 
a day. The second margarine, called "take control," lowered bad cholesterol 
by 5% to 10% when eaten once or twice a day. The study subjects had 
moderately high cholesterol, and their levels dropped just a few weeks 
after they started eating the margarines. While these new margarines 
may be effective, they're no replacement for prescription drugs for 
people who have very high cholesterol. Drugs can lower cholesterol 
much more dramatically than the margarines can. And there are other 
concerns. The American heart association's Dr. Ronald krauss says 
eating large quantities of stanol esters could block absorption of 
vitamins called "Carotenoids," which can help fight cancer. Also, 
he warns -- Again, there's a lot of individual variability. And we 
can't assume that just by taking a product that has a certain track 
record, when it's used in studies, in medical centers and universities 
that this is going to necessarily have the same benefit in you as 
an individual. He also says even if the margarine does work, eating 
it is no excuse for going on a high-fat binge, which could raise your 
cholesterol even more. Elizabeth Cohen, CNN, Atlanta.
