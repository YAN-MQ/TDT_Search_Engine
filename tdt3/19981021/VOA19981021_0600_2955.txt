Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit widened in August to a record as 
exports fell to a 1.5 year low and imports increased. The red ink 
rose to nearly $17 billion after widening in July by $14.5 billion 
Paul Taylor, senior economist at America's Community Bankers, was 
asked what the numbers say about U.S. growth. Well, it tells us that 
we're not going to get it from our exports and that our imports just 
kicked up and that's going to offset some of our domestic product 
and sales. The rest of the world is still - seems to be depending 
on the U.S. consumer. And that's a global question that we have to 
answer. At the current pace, the trade shortfall for all of this year 
could top the all-time record set back in 1987 of more than $153 billion.
