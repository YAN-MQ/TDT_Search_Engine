With the Texas state environmental agency set to meet on Thursday 
to decide whether to license a proposed dump for storing out-of-state 
low-level nuclear waste about 20 miles from Mexico's border, a group 
of Mexican lawmakers has been in Austin since Saturday trying to persuade 
the state to relocate the proposed site. ``Even if it's a low-level 
risk, why are they burying all this material so close to the border 
where it will affect our water?'' Carlos Camacho Alcazar, a Mexican 
congressman who represents the border city of Ciudad Juarez, said 
inside a cramped mobile home parked a few dozen yards from the governor's 
official residence here. Camacho, a member National Action Party, 
arrived in Austin with more than a dozen other Mexican lawmakers as 
part of their continuing effort to meet with Gov. George Bush. Two 
of the lawmakers have been fasting in anticipation of the vote, by 
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Although Camacho 
and several other Mexican lawmakers met this week with the Texas Secretary 
of State Alberto Gonzales, and asked for a meeting with Bush, the 
governor has refused. Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said 
that he had already met with all of the governors of Mexico's border 
states and that he had discussed the project with them. ``This is 
a regulatory process,'' Edwards said. ``It's not appropriate for political 
leaders to intervene in a scientific regulatory process. Governor 
Bush believes the people of Texas want regulatory issues to be based 
on science and public health and safety and not on politics.'' If 
the project is approved, as is expected, the town of Sierra Blanca 
_ 90 miles southeast of El Paso, with 600 residents, two-thirds Hispanic, 
and a per capita income of $8,000 _ would be the site. It would make 
Texas the fourth state with a low-level radioactive waste site. The 
others are South Carolina, Utah and Washington. The Sierra Blanca 
site would receive low-level radioactive waste from Maine and Vermont 
under a compact that was approved last month by Congress and signed 
by President Clinton. Camacho asserts that if the permit is approved, 
``West Texas is going to turn into the trash dump of the world and 
we consider that racial discrimination.'' David Frederick, a lawyer 
for the Sierra Blanca Legal Defense Fund, points out that Bush has 
said he wants to get 40 percent of the Hispanic vote for his re-election 
bid. ``I don't see how he's going to get it if his appointees approve 
the license for the dump,'' said Frederick, who said the permit should 
be turned down for technical reasons. In July, two state administrative 
law judges ruled that the license for the waste site should be rejected 
because it did not include a thorough geological survey of the region. 
The judges also said the dump could degrade the quality of life for 
residents of Sierra Blanca, despite the economic benefits from such 
a project.
