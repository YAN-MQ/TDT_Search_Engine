Angered by plans to close their factory in December, two dozen workers 
took over a Volvo plant Wednesday in an attempt to force the company 
to improve its severance proposal. The protest halted production at 
the plant, and the workers said they were prepared to continue the 
occupation until the company made concessions. Volvo Canada officials 
announced six weeks ago that the assembly plant in suburban Halifax 
would close Dec. 18, throwing more than 200 people out of work. Larry 
Wark, area director of the Canadian Auto Workers, said the Swedish-owned 
company is not offering workers proper severance packages or time 
off to find new jobs. ``Everybody's too busy to talk to us at Volvo 
Canada so at this point in time the membership is fed up,'' said Wark, 
who joined the occupation. ``We certainly contacted the Swedes and 
they'll be contacted again to let them know in Sweden that you don't 
do this in your country, and you're not going to do it in ours.'' 
The president of Volvo's Canadian operations condemned the occupation 
and said there would be no further negotiations until plant operations 
return to normal. ``The actions of a few, irresponsible individuals 
intent on grandstanding can only harm all employees and make an already 
difficult situation worse,'' said Gord Sonnenberg of Volvo Canada 
Ltd. He said their actions ``are damaging to the reputation of the 
entire workforce at a time when the company, the community and various 
governments are working hard to re-employ these workers.'' The plant 
employs about 165 hourly and 35 salaried staff, plus some contract 
workers. Its maximum annual output was about 8,200 vehicles. The company 
said in September that the plant did not fit into its plans for a 
global restructuring of its manufacturing facilities. The union had 
been lobbying to keep the Halifax plant open through a joint venture 
between Volvo and a Toronto auto-parts company. A delegation had traveled 
to Sweden to pitch the idea, without success.
