Turning now to Africa - South Africa has released the results of its 
first post-apartheid census, a study that President Nelson Mandela 
says shows continuing divisions between rich and poor that reflect 
the country's historical racial divisions. VOA correspondent Alex 
Belida reports from Johannesburg. The census reveals that South Africa 
has a population of just over 40 million people, 77 percent of them 
black, 11 percent white, 9 percent mixed race and 3 percent Asia. 
It also reveals that more than 33 percent of the country's economically 
active population between the ages of 15 and 65 is unemployed, most 
of them black. Among those who are working, blacks generally earn 
less than their white counterparts. While nearly two-thirds of white 
males earn 3,500 rand or more - that's just under $600 U.S. -- only 
6 percent of black males earn that much. Other statistics in the census 
report are equally revealing. While nearly all white households in 
South Africa have flush or chemical toilets, only a third of black 
households have the same facilities. In receiving the report, President 
Mandela said it showed the need for all South Africans to rededicate 
themselves to what he called the historic mission of transforming 
the society in order to eradicate the poverty and imbalances that 
derive from the country's past. He said the scale of this inherited 
social inequality means the task will be a long one. But he said his 
government has made a good start with its programs aimed at providing 
housing, electricity and running water to hundreds of thousands of 
South Africa's previously disadvantaged majority population. The census 
was carried out two years ago. A preliminary assessment put the country's 
overall population at just under 38 million, but that was revised 
upward for the final report because post-census research found many 
South Africans had not been counted. Alex Belida, VOA NEWS, Johannesburg.
