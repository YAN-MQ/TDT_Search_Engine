I'm Dave DeForrest, VOA NEWS. Putting aside and Israeli threat to 
walk out of the Mideast summit, Washington has presented the text 
of its proposal for Israel to give Palestinians more of the West Bank. 
U.S. officials say talks at the secluded summit site near Washington 
are at their most critical moment. VOA's Kyle King as the report. 
Despite more than 50 hours of direct talks by President Clinton, the 
State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin says there are still significant 
obstacles blocking an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. 
We are at a critical moment - a moment of intensity and importance. 
What the result of this will be is up to the leaders. Mr. Rubin says 
the United States is now presenting the two sides with a written text 
that he hopes will form the basis of an accord. Earlier in the day, 
a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no agreement 
was possible until there were more concessions from the Palestinians. 
President Clinton will decide later in the day if he'll come back 
for another round of personal diplomacy. Kyle King, VOA NEWS, Wye 
Mills.
