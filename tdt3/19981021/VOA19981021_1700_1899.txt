Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is threatening to walk out 
of the talks unless Palestinians agree to purge the PLO charter of 
all anti-Israeli language. A Netanyahu aide says the prime minister 
is waiting for a reply from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Palestinians 
say Mr. Netanyahu is bluffing. They say he agreed Tuesday to give 
Mr. Arafat two weeks after an accord is signed to act on the PLO charter 
issue. Israeli television, meanwhile, says Mr. Netanyahu is asking 
President Clinton to free Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard to deflect 
negative Israeli public opinion if Mr. Netanyahu finally agrees to 
give up more West Bank land.
