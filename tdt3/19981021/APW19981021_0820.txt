Visiting Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides on Wednesday 
reiterated his country's support for Syria in its conflict with Turkey 
over Kurdish rebels, Egypt's news agency reported. Kasoulides, who 
arrived here Tuesday on a three-day visit, met with Egypt's Foreign 
Minister Amr Moussa and Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid. 
The Middle East News Agency quoted Kasoulides as saying after the 
meetings that Cyprus supports Syria's stance and rejects the language 
of threats and force as a method to solve problems between countries. 
Tensions between Turkey and Syria ran high during the past weeks after 
Ankara threatened to use military force to stop what it called Syria's 
sheltering Turkish Kurdish rebels. Cyprus also has been at loggerheads 
with Turkey since 1974 when Turkey invaded Cyprus and occupied the 
northern third of the island. The Turkey-Syria dispute appears to 
be waning now after Turkey said Syria has signed an agreement to ensure 
that Kurdish guerrillas do not stage cross-border attacks on Turkey. 
The Syrian government has not acknowledged signing the agreement but 
its official news agency, SANA, on Wednesday branded a major Kurdish 
rebel group as an ``illegal and unlicensed party.'' ``It has no bases 
or camps in Syria. It is not allowed to carry out any activity from 
Syrian territories,'' SANA said. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak shuttled 
between Turkey and Syria to help ease the tensions. Kasoulides is 
scheduled to meet with Mubarak later. ``We are happy that we were 
able to participate and contribute in easing tension between the two 
countries,'' Moussa, the foreign minister, said.
