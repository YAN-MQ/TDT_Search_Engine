Turkey says Syria has signed an accord pledging to stop supporting 
the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party and to shut its camps in Syria and 
the Syrian-controlled Becaa Valley in Lebanon. The announcement was 
made today after Turkish and Syrian officials concluded two days of 
talks late yesterday in Turkey. Earlier, Turkey's foreign minister, 
Ismayel Gem, told reporters that Syria had also agreed not to allow 
Kurdish rebels to stage cross-border attacks on Turkey from Syrian 
territory. He said Syria will brand the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party 
a terrorist organization and will deny party leader Abduallah Ojalan 
access to Syria. The agreement was signed by Rusial, Turkish deputy 
foreign minister, and General Adnan Boder al-Hassan, Syria's top security 
official.
