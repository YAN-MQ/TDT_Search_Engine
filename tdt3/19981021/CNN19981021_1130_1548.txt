The school of the future is replacing wooden desks with computer stations. 
Michael Collins takes a look. a new day is dawning on education in 
this north Detroit suburb. Clarkston high school may be the prototype 
for what high-tech schools of the future will be like. At a cost of 
$58 million, this brand new school features over 700 computers. That's 
one for every three students at a cost of $1,600 each. They are interconnected 
by some 40 miles of fiberoptic cable, and even computer-savvy kids 
are impressed. Bryan Hart's a senior interested in engineering. We've 
got all different things. You go from automotive stuff, to doppler 
radar, to bridge building, to aerodynamics in planes. Then you get 
to go to another section and fly a plane. Thy twilight Everything 
here is interconnected. Even traditional music rooms are high tech 
-- microphones in the ceiling make them instant recording studios. 
School officials here say the school's cost is about $13 million more 
than a traditional school building. And at $107 a square foot, it's 
worth every penny. Since we just moved into our building, we anticipate 
that our test scores will go up. We know they will go up. You're an 
accomplished writer, that's a real goal. And teachers say students' 
interest level goes up too. I think the computer makes you more creative. 
I think it allows more play, more wonder, more curiosity. And the 
students seem to be more willing to rework, to rethink. As impressive 
as this new technology is, the administration at clarkston high school 
insists the most important element is still the human touch and the 
teachers who can motivate and light a fire in a student's mind. And 
as different as education may seem in 1998 -- The pizza's kind of 
burnt and it's really greasy. Some things remain the same. Michael 
Collins, CNN, clarkston, Michigan.
