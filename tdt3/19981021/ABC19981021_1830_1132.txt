Tonight we'll take "A closer look" at the '98 vote. The midterm elections 
are less than two weeks away, the entire House of Representatives, 
a third of the Senate and races in every state. We'll take some time 
every night now to focus on what counts in various parts of the country. 
As everyone plays the expectations game, here are some of the basics 
about the Congress. This year the republicans go into the campaign 
with the narrowest majority they have had in the House of Representatives 
since 1954. They have 228 seats in the current house. The democrats 
have 206. Not many incumbents of either party are retiring, and no 
matter what is going on in Washington at any given time, incumbents, 
with their ability to raise money for advertising and organization, 
usually have a powerful edge. In the Senate, the republicans have 
a ten-seat majority. 55 seats to 45 for the democrats. 34 Senate seats 
are being contested. In 29 of those races, it's an incumbent senator 
running for re-election. As for issues, all politics do tend to be 
local, and as of tonight, best we can tell, most candidates in most 
races are staying away from the Monica lewinsky/Bill Clinton scandal. 
Politicians seem to be talking most about education and crime. HMOs, 
taxes and social security as always.
