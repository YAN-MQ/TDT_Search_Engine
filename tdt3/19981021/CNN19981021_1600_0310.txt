White House lawyers are meeting face to face with house Judiciary 
committee investigators to lay out ground rules for President Clinton's 
impeachment hearings. The most contentious issue will be the factual 
stipulations about president clinton's relationship with former White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky. Republicans want the White House to 
stipulate a list of things as true, primarily the grand jury testimony 
of key witnesses. Committee republicans have said the White House's 
cooperation is essential if the inquiry is to be completed by the 
end of the year.
