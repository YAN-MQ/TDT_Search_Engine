The Security Council met Wednesday to work out details of a resolution 
supporting the agreement to allow 2,000 unarmed monitors to roam Kosovo 
to ensure fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians has ceased. 
Britain is taking the lead in drafting the resolution, which would 
lend the weight of international law to the verification team from 
the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to the team, and to withdraw 
his special forces from the southern Serb province, after talks in 
Belgrade with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that staved off threatened 
NATO action. Milosevic said Wednesday he remained committed to the 
agreement, despite what he called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage 
it, a view echoed by Yugoslavia's acting ambassador at the United 
Nations. ``We are implementing the agreement in good faith,'' Ambassador 
Vladislav Jovanovic told a news conference, saying the government 
was pulling back police units and reducing the number of army units. 
Serb security forces have not carried out ``anti-terrorist activities'' 
for several weeks except in response to direct attacks, he said. He 
also accused Kosovo Albanian political and rebel leaders of failing 
to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for an end 
to the fighting, a negotiated settlement, and an acceptance of Serbia's 
territorial integrity. The main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, 
has not denounced separatism, condemned terrorism and accepted an 
unconditional resumption of dialogue, Jovanovic said. Fighting between 
Serb forces and ethnic Albanians _ who make up an overwhelming majority 
of the population of Kosovo _ has killed hundreds of people and forced 
around 300,000 from their homes since a Serb crackdown began in February. 
Serbia is the largest of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia. 
Recent rebel attacks and a subsequent buildup of Serb forces have 
raised fears about the Oct. 12 agreement, under which Milosevic agreed 
to a cease-fire, the withdrawal of his special forces, the safe return 
of refugees and a timetable for restoring self-rule to the province. 
The Security Council outlined those demands in a Sept. 23 resolution 
that threatened unspecified measures if both sides didn't comply. 
The resolution was enacted under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which 
means it can be enforced militarily. Still unclear is whether the 
new resolution will provide for enforcement as well or will rely on 
the Sept. 23 resolution. Jovanovic said his government was not opposed 
to the Security Council endorsing the agreement, but said Yugoslavia 
would oppose any attempt to add other issues not in the Milosevic-Holbrooke 
agreement to the resolution. A British official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said Britain simply wanted the strongest resolution 
possible to ``make Milosevic stick to his word.'' Russia and China, 
two permanent council members with a veto, are opposed to any use 
or threats of force.
