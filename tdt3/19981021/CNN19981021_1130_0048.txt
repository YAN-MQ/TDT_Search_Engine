The center for science in the public interest says children drink 
a Breathtaking amount of soda. The group says boys between 13 and 
18 years of age tend to drink more than 36 ounces of pop a day. Girls 
the same age drink more than 24 ounces a day. Those drinks make up 
about 18% of the average child's diet. I think parents need to look 
at just how much soda pop their kids are drinking. If they're drinking 
more than one a day, they certainly should get their kids to cut back. 
They should also look at the serving sizes. 50 years ago, Coca-Cola 
came in a 6 1/2-ounce bottle. Now a 20-ounce bottle is becoming the 
standard. So, one soda pop now is very different from one soda pop 
50 years ago.
