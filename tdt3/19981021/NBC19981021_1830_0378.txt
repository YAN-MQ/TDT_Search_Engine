An added human drama Jordan's king Hussein has added considerable 
authority to the peace talks. And he did so in the middle of the greatest 
personal struggle of his life. NBC's Andrea Mitchell tonight on the 
king, his queen, and their private and public battles. The picture 
is shocking. Jordan's king Hussein, now gaunt from three months of 
chemotherapy for cancer. In July, the king told his people it's not 
fatal. And this week, the cancer did not stop the king from piloting 
his own jet from his treatments at the mayo clinic in Minnesota to 
try to save the summit. With his his wife helping him fight the disease. 
He and I see this as yet another battle to fight and to win. Queen 
noor of Jordan, born and raised in America. Part grace Kelly, part 
political activist. Every day brings us better news. The first few 
days were quite harrowing. It came as a shock to us when he was diagnosed. 
a Princeton graduate from a prominent Arab-American family, she met 
the king 22 years ago while working in Jordan. And so began what friends 
call a storybook romance, but set in a country surrounded by war. 
And unfortunately, a region that is considered the land Mines' heartland 
of the world. So in addition to caring for her husband, she is also 
crusading to rid the world of land Mines. What do you think you can 
bring to this subject of land Mines? A lot of energy and a mideast 
perspective. Wars end, but land Mines, intended to maim or kill enemies, 
remain buried 50, even 100 years, regardless of who steps on them. 
300,000 Mines in Jordan alone. So she visits the wounded, lobbies 
world leaders. Even while struggling with her own personal crisis, 
they are far from his people and their struggle for peace. Is that 
a concern? His absence during a time when Israel and the Palestinians 
are at such loggerheads? Whatever need they might have of him, he'll 
be on the first plane back, as he put it, "chemotherapy be damned." 
Ready to work for peace, as he proved again this week. Andrea Mitchell, 
NBC news, Washington.
