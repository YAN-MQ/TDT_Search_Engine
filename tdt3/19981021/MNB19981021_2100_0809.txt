As we mentioned, still changing situation tonight, another long day 
of negotiations on Maryland's eastern shore, day seven of the Middle 
East peace summit despite the arrival of a crucial player. The talks 
teetered on the brink all day amid talk of both sides pulling out. 
We go to Andrea Mitchell, who's watching things in the NBC news Washington 
bureau. Are they on or off again? They are sort of on again tonight. 
A last minute attempt to rescue the summit, Israel's prime minister 
Netanyahu had threatened to leave tonight or perhaps in the morning. 
The plane is on the runway. It's been gassed up. The sticking point, 
specific anti-terror guarantees. The U.S. has offered to have the 
C.I.A. play honest broker. Israel says that's not good enough. Unless 
negotiators can work this out, the president will not be going back 
to the summit. Even though neutral observers believe that Israel has 
already gotten 95% of what they wanted, that the Palestinian offer 
is a serious one, and that Israel ought to settle. But we don't know 
whether they will and whether the president would go back tonight, 
more likely if they would be still willing to get past this deadlock, 
he would go back. And a very ominous development, Andrea. Senior U.S. 
officials telling NBC news that U.S. analysts expect a wave of terrorism 
in Israel if the plantation talks fail, leading to a hardening of 
positions on both sides. There's concern about U.S. personnel in facilities 
overseas if this happens. And again ominous, and it's all happening 
despite the much-heralded arrival of a widely respected and very ill 
statesman. Exactly. Everyone has put out extraordinary efforts, but 
perhaps no one more than the legendary Middle East figure, 45-year 
reigning monarch in the world, Jordan's king Hussein, respected by 
all sides at the summit yesterday, today, by telephone, on the phone 
trying to push the leaders to settle despite the fact, Brian, that 
the king is now engaged in the biggest battle of his life.
