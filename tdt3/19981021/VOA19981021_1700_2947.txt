It's time now for business news and here's Elaine Johannsen with the 
day's doings on New York's Wall Street. It was a close call. The market 
was up and down all day. The Dow Jones finally closed at 8,519, a 
gain - a modest one, but a gain nonetheless - of 13 points. The Standard 
& Poor's 500 Index also closed up nearly six points. But the big story 
on Wall Street was the technology-dominated NASDAQ index, surging 
for a gain of 35 points. It was driven mostly by Microsoft, which 
had reported better-than-expect third-quarter earnings. IBM also helped 
drive the market with a positive earnings report. IBM shares reached 
a new all-time high. Analysts say the market's apparent lack of conviction 
Wednesday was probably due to investors assessing corporate earnings. 
In any case, the rally that began when U.S. interest rates were cut 
last week has started to settle down. Analysts are calling it a reality 
check. Elaine Johannsen, VOA NEWS, New York.
