The World Series moved across the country on Tuesday night, but the 
owners of the teams playing in it acted as if they were back on Broadway. 
Whether by design or coincidence, George Steinbrenner and John Moores 
appeared to be performing a play within a play. Using dialogue that 
was scripted or spontaneous, each insulted the other's ball park, 
which ordinarily would offend the other. In this comedy, however, 
they were actually trying to help each other get a new park. Getting 
a new park is in vogue today. Until Moores spoke out about Yankee 
Stadium, New York City's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, had been the only outspoken 
booster of a new home for the Yankees. But Moores joined Giuliani 
on Tuesday. ``For once, George Steinbrenner may have badly understated 
the problems,'' Moores said in response to a question about Yankee 
Stadium at a news conference. Moores had joined Larry Lucchino, the 
Padres' president, and Mayor Susan Golding of San Diego at the news 
conference to talk about the referendum that will be on the city ballot 
in two weeks to provide money for a new park for the Padres. Moores 
might never have offered his comments on Yankee Stadium had the question 
not been asked, but it was inevitable that the matter would be raised 
because he had trashed the Stadium in comments that appeared in The 
San Diego Union-Tribune. About an hour after Moores expressed his 
views, Steinbrenner, who never appears on the field before a World 
Series game, suddenly burst into the Yankees' dugout and instantly 
made his pitch for a new park for the Padres. Electioneering two weeks 
before the vote can't hurt. ``What's going on with this field?'' he 
said. ``It looks terrible. They've got to give these people a new 
stadium. Or they ought to move their team. They've done a magnificent 
job. The city is behind it. That thing is like a cow pasture.'' Steinbrenner 
was referring to the football game that was played at Qualcomm Stadium 
on Sunday, the ninth professional and college football game that has 
been played on the Padres' field this season. ``Give these people 
a new stadium like they deserve,'' the owner said. ``John has done 
everything he could. I know football and I know bad fields. That field 
is pretty well chewed up. If they don't give him a new stadium, they're 
crazy.'' Steinbrenner was told that Moores had said New York City 
should give the Yankees a new stadium. ``That's nice of him; I appreciate 
it,'' he said. ``John has done a magnificent job with this team, he 
and Lucchino, and they deserve a new stadium.'' The Padres and the 
city want voters to authorize the expenditure of $411 million on a 
downtown redevelopment project that would include a $267.5 million 
ball park. A referendum on a new park for the Yankees has been in 
the courts and may never reach the voters. Unlike Giuliani, Moores 
felt certain that if given the chance, New York voters would agree 
to spend taxpayer money. ``I suspect anybody who's been to Camden 
Yards and then goes back to Yankee Stadium would vote for something 
like Camden Yards,'' Moores said after the news conference. But what 
about the cost? In San Diego, it's $267.5 million. In New York, specifically 
Manhattan, which is where Giuliani and Steinbrenner want it, a new 
park would cost more than $1 billion. ``If you look at the gross domestic 
product of San Diego and compare that to New York's, I don't care 
what they have to spend on a ball park there,'' he said. ``They can 
afford it, one way or another. My feeling is that most citizens pay 
their taxes and don't really expect that much back for it. They're 
passionate about their sports teams.'' A minute later Moores said: 
``It's hard for me to imagine that the only superpower in the world 
cannot sustain the greatest franchise on the planet in an appropriate 
way. That just doesn't make a lot of sense. Dirt is expensive in New 
York. That's part of the charm. If it weren't so expensive you probably 
wouldn't want to build a ball park there.'' Moores visited Yankee 
Stadium for the first time last week during the first two games of 
the World Series. He talked of the moist eyes and goose pimples that 
a tour of the Yankee Stadium monuments evoked. ``Yankee Stadium is 
like a cathedral,'' he said. But he added: ``Once the eyes clear and 
the brain starts to work, you look around. Yankee Stadium is not very 
adequate.'' He said he was shocked and amazed at the myriad problems 
he found, including aisles that are too small, an ``awful'' concessions 
situation, ``real tough'' parking and too many seats upstairs and 
too few good seats downstairs. ``The South Bronx is a tough location,'' 
Moores said. ``I suspect what ultimately will happen is there will 
have to be a lot of redevelopment of the South Bronx to make it a 
better location or they're going to have to figure out how to pay 
the tariff on Manhattan or watch the thing go to New Jersey. The fans 
of baseball are not being well served at Yankee Stadium.'' Included 
in Moores' remarks as a subplot was a pitch for himself and other 
owners of low-revenue clubs. ``In an era of revenue sharing, I sincerely 
hope George gets something done sooner rather than later,'' he said. 
And in a subsequent similar reference, he said: ``My guess is New 
York City will get it done. They'll have the kind of ball park that 
the city deserves and they'll carry on the Yankee tradition and I 
hope there's a lot more Yankee money for revenue sharing.''
