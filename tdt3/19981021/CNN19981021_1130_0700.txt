An exotic trip outside the country can be a dream come true. But in 
the event of a medical problem or emergency, it can turn into a real 
nightmare. The U.S. state department is warning travelers to be better 
prepared about medical issues before they leave home. Immunizations 
should be received well in advance of departure. Check with the centers 
for disease control and prevention for any health warnings at your 
destination. Be aware that Medicare and some insurance plans do not 
provide coverage for medical costs or hospitalization outside the 
United States. And elderly and previously ill travelers should consider 
buying sufficient insurance to cover hospital treatment abroad or 
medical evacuation. Medevac insurance may not appear inexpensive, 
but some experts say it's worth every penny compared with the high 
cost to be evacuated from another country in an emergency. The state 
department has compiled a list of companies that provide insurance 
and other international travel assistance. To receive the list by 
fax, call -- 202-647-3000 and to receive it online, go to -- travel.state.gov/medical.html.
