Let go, give in, and take the journey.'' That slogan, a fatuous a 
new-age variation of the '60s ``turn on, tune in, drop out,'' is the 
motto of Eddie Murphy's character, a bald-headed prophet who goes 
simply by the initial G. in the movie ``Holy Man.'' The soft-spoken, 
ever-smiling G. (is it short for God, Gabriel, Gump, Godawful?) appears 
one day on a Miami freeway to help two harried executives from the 
Good Buy Shopping Network fix a flat tire. Before you can say abracadabra, 
G. has ascended as the star and savior of the financially ailing network. 
Instead of hawking the products in front of him, G. delivers anti-materialistic 
stop-and-smell-the-roses raps that magically sell all the junk the 
network has piled up in its warehouse. ``Holy Man'' is the latest 
and arguably the shoddiest recent Hollywood movie to exploit mass 
culture's rampant ``Touched by an Angel'' syndrome, in which a heavenly 
figure intervenes in earthly matters to provide a comforting glimpse 
of spiritual enlightenment and sometimes also to solve characters' 
romantic problems. Especially when that enlightenment involves true 
love, things on the screen can get awfully sticky. Earlier this year, 
``City of Angels,'' the slick picture-postcard remake of Wim Wenders' 
surreal fantasy ``Wings of Desire,'' presented Nicolas Cage as an 
angel who falls so in love with Meg Ryan, playing a nice lady doctor, 
that he forfeits eternal life to taste the pleasures of sex, surf 
and California cuisine. Never mind that the two stars have no chemistry 
or that Cage's demeanor is closer to that of a serial killer than 
a suitor. The movie insists that they are made for each other, and 
if heavens have declared it, it must be so. Currently, Robin Williams 
and Annabella Sciorra are dampening the screen with their tear-drenched 
afterlife reunion in ``What Dreams May Come,'' a bombastic, trippy 
swatch of love-beyond-death kitsch in which Williams, a kindly pediatrician 
who dies in a car accident, travels from heaven to hell to rescue 
his wife who committed suicide. There's no particular chemistry here 
either to support the film's insistence that these two are soul mates 
in the most cosmic sense. Coming right up is ``Meet Joe Black,'' a 
lavish, similarly secularized three-hour remake of the 1934 Frederic 
March movie ``Death Takes a Holiday.'' In a film that almost feels 
like a sequel to ``City of Angels,'' Death (Brad Pitt) decides to 
take a break from his grim duties to assume human form and pal around 
with a media mogul named Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins). In exchange 
for Bill's playing earthly tour guide, Death promises to extend his 
life at least beyond his 65th birthday bash. Before you can say shazam, 
Pitt's earthly embodiment, who goes by the name Joe Black, has fallen 
in love with Susan (Claire Forlani), the younger of the mogul's two 
daughters, who also happens to be a nice lady doctor. Like Cage's 
angel, Pitt's character ecstatically savors food (he's hooked on peanut 
butter) and sex for the first time. So much of the story is devoted 
to corporate skulduggery that this extremely somber movie feels more 
like a millennial elegy to big business than a supernatural love story. 
Let's not forget the recently released ``Still Breathing,'' in which 
Brendan Fraser is a hunky San Antonio street performer who melts the 
hardened heart of Joanna Going's Los Angeles fine arts consultant. 
How do we know they're made for each other? Fraser's latter-day hippie, 
like all the men in his family, has romantic second sight. Long before 
he meets the woman fate intended for him, he has seen her face in 
his dreams. On the kiddie front, there is ``Simon Birch,'' John Irving's 
novel ``A Prayer for Owen Meany'' reduced to a saccharine parable 
of an adorable disabled child who anticipates a heroic deed that will 
define his reason for being. That event will also cost him his life. 
In the year's phoniest movie death scene, Simon slips away from this 
world, sweetly murmuring, ``Gotta go now.'' For the holidays, there's 
``Jack Frost,'' whose title character (Michael Keaton) is a musician 
who dies in a car accident but returns to earth as a snowman built 
by his young son. What's disturbing about these films isn't their 
stories. Who doesn't enjoy a good supernatural yarn with a misty-eyed 
twist? It's their grandiose air of sanctity that cloys. They are bloated 
reflections of a narcissistic age obsessed with eternal youth. If 
love is decreed by magic, you don't have to work at it. All you have 
to do is gaze into your partner's eyes and ``know.'' If spiritual 
insight arrives from on high, you don't have to waste precious time 
in prayer, meditation and study. If you're determined to invest occult 
fantasies with a deeper spiritual meaning, what better symbol is there 
than an angel, a manifestation of divinity that isn't readily attached 
to a particular dogma? Most of these movies come with overbearing 
quasi-symphonic soundtracks that press emotional buttons that their 
sappy screenplays and misty-eyed performances can't reach. So here 
we are at the millennium. Our material abundance has fueled our lust 
for more and better and faster gratification. Instant ecstasy. And 
what often passes for faith is a bloodthirsty fundamentalism. So why 
not retreat to fairyland where Peter Pan, the fairy godmother or Santa 
are custom designing million-to-one shot miracles just for you?
