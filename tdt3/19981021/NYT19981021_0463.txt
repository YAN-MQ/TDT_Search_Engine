Invoking relatives he had lost in the Holocaust, Rep. Charles Schumer 
on Wednesday assailed Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for gathering Holocaust 
survivors to attack Schumer's record on Jewish issues. He also berated 
D'Amato for disparaging him with a Yiddish vulgarism at a meeting 
with Jewish leaders earlier this week. In the latest indication of 
the attention that both candidates are paying to Jewish voters, Schumer 
chastised his opponent both for staging the news conference at a Holocaust 
memorial Sunday morning, and then for insulting him with the Yiddishism. 
His vehement response comes at a time when D'Amato's attacks on Schumer's 
congressional attendance record have largely dominated the campaign. 
``I lost family in the Holocaust, and my wife lost family in the Holocaust,'' 
Schumer said in grim tones, fairly leaping at the question after it 
was raised at the end of a news conference about gun control. Aides 
said Schumer's great-grandmother and seven of her nine children were 
killed by Nazis. ``Yesterday, Al D'Amato used a cheap slur against 
me, and then, when asked, lied about it,'' the congressman, a Brooklyn 
Democrat, continued. ``Al D'Amato and I are meeting in debate Saturday. 
I challenge you, Al D'Amato, to say to my face that I am not committed 
to victims of the Holocaust. I challenge you at the debate Saturday 
to use that cheap slur.'' D'Amato at first said he did not recall 
using the vulgarism, which was first reported in the latest issue 
of Jewish Week, dated Oct. 23. ``I have absolutely no knowledge of 
ever having made that statement,'' D'Amato said. ``I have no knowledge 
of it. Certainly never in a public domain.'' But a number of participants 
at the private meeting on Tuesday, including former Mayor Ed Koch, 
who is D'Amato's most prominent Jewish supporter, confirmed that the 
senator had in fact called Schumer ``a putzhead.'' At the same meeting, 
they said, D'Amato referred to Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat, 
as ``Jerry Waddler,'' a presumed reference to Nadler's substantial 
weight. Wednesday night, D'Amato sent a letter to Schumer in which 
he implicitly admitted using the Yiddishism _ but remained on the 
attack, asserting that it was Schumer who was trying to ``inject religious 
differences'' into the campaign. Making no mention of his earlier 
denials, D'Amato wrote: ``The Yiddish word I used to describe you 
at a private meeting means `fool.' Again, you are trying to twist 
that into a religious slur. And again, I stand by my remark 100 percent.'' 
In ``The Joys of Yiddish,'' by Leo Rosten (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1968), 
the word ``putz'' is defined as ``vulgar slang for `penis,''' which 
is used as ``a term of contempt for a fool'' or ``a jerk.'' Rosten 
adds a cautionary note: ``Putz is not to be used lightly or when women 
or children are around.'' Wednesday's exchange was another example 
of Schumer using against D'Amato a weapon that the senator had employed 
against one of his own opponents. The congressman's injured tone recalled 
the way D'Amato reacted six years ago, almost to the day, after his 
Democratic challenger, Robert Abrams, called D'Amato a ``fascist.'' 
D'Amato presented himself as a sympathetic figure under attack, and 
forced Abrams, then the state attorney general, to defend himself 
against allegations of anti-Italian bias. D'Amato's impolitic description 
of two of New York City's best-known Democratic members of Congress 
was not entirely out of character for the senator, who once used a 
fake Japanese accent to mock Lance Ito, the Japanese-American judge 
in the O.J. Simpson murder trial. But D'Amato, a disciplined politician, 
normally keeps a tight rein on his public utterances in the middle 
of a campaign. And some of his advisers expressed concern Wednesday 
night that his remarks, coupled with criticism over D'Amato's Holocaust 
news conference, could pose a problem for the senator. There clearly 
was an element of calculation in Schumer's attack. Although he and 
Nadler had accused D'Amato of politicizing the Holocaust after the 
Sunday news conference at the Holocaust Memorial Wall across from 
the United Nations, Schumer did not mention his lost relatives until 
Wednesday.
