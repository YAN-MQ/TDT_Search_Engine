A group calling itself Zapata occupied Mexico's embassy in Oslo on 
Wednesday, demanding the release of political prisoners in the Chiapas 
region, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported. Oslo police confirmed 
an incident at the embassy, but said they had no other immediate details 
about the incident or the group. The Mexican embassy refused to comment, 
and referred all queries to the police. NTB said the group sent a 
news release in which they demanded the immediate release of prisoners 
in the troubled southern Mexico province. The state radio network 
NRK said the embassy did not immediately ask police to remove the 
roughly 30 demonstrators.
