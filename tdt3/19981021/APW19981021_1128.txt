For months, Dominique Moceanu argued with her parents, trying to find 
out where all her money was going. She never got any answers. Now 
the Olympic gymnast has split from her parents. She is hiding out 
from them and hired a lawyer. She is 17 years old and wants to be 
declared an adult so she can claim her earnings. ``I kill myself training 
and going to school, and what is he doing with my money?'' Moceanu 
said in the Houston Chronicle on Wednesday, referring to her father. 
``They haven't been working since 1996. Where does their income come 
from? Me.'' Her father threatened over the weekend to have her beloved 
Romanian coach deported. That was enough to send her to the office 
of lawyer Roy Moore. On Monday, he asked a court to declare the gymnast 
an adult. Moore said neither he nor his client knows how much money 
she has earned or how much has been lost. But Moore said a trust that 
had been set up for her is all but gone. Moore suspects that trust 
bankrolled a dlrs 4 million gym and other ventures, including a clothing 
outlet, under the Moceanu Gymnastics Inc. business title. If she is 
declared an adult, Moceanu would be entitled to the earnings from 
the businesses. A temporary restraining order was issued Monday to 
keep the gymnast's parents from her at least until a Nov. 11 hearing. 
Calls by The Associated Press to the parents, Dumitru and Camelia 
Moceanu, at the Houston gym and their home were not returned Wednesday. 
Moceanu, born in Los Angeles in 1981, moved to the Houston area with 
her parents in 1990 so she could train with Bela Karolyi, the famed 
coach of Nadia Comaneci, Mary Lou Retton and Kerri Strug. For the 
five years leading to the 1996 Olympics, Moceanu trained in Karolyi's 
gym. After Atlanta, Karolyi sold his gym and said he was retiring 
from elite coaching. So Moceanu's father, a used-car salesman, poured 
more than dlrs 4 million into a new gym and his daughter went from 
coach to coach before settling on Luminita Miscenco, now credited 
with reviving Moceanu's floundering career. At 14, Moceanu was the 
youngest member of the 1996 Olympic team at the Atlanta Games and 
is the only member of that team still competing in all gymnastics 
events. She expects to compete in the world championships next year 
and possibly the 2000 Sydney Games. In August, she became the first 
non-Russian to win the all-around competition at the Goodwill Games. 
After months of arguing, Moceanu's father threatened on Saturday to 
fire Miscenco and have her deported. With Miscenco by her side, a 
fearful but determined Moceanu made a second call to Moore from a 
shopping mall and asked to meet with him. She's been living with friends 
since. In her interview with the Chronicle, Moceanu revealed a darker 
side to the pixie persona shown at the Atlanta Games. ``Things have 
been getting rough for a while, a lot of people don't know,'' she 
told the newspaper. ``We've been trying to keep things hidden.'' Moceanu 
said her life and her relationship with her parents was far different 
from that of the typical teen-ager. ``It always had to be about the 
gym,'' she said. ``I would think, `Don't you guys know anything besides 
gymnastics? Can't we go out for ice cream? Can't you be my mom and 
dad instead of me being your business?' The gymnast also told the 
newspaper her father has hit her a ``couple of times.'' Despite the 
legal fight ahead, Moceanu hopes to mend her family life. ``I love 
my parents,'' she said. ``I hope that after all this is over, we'll 
be closer than ever. That would be my dream.''
