This is Orelon Sidney with your "Headline News weather update." A 
reinforcing shot of cool air is moving through portions of the eastern 
U.S. this will allow a cold Ridge of high pressure to settle into 
the plains states and the southeast. Coldest air of the season so 
far can be expected down to the gulf coast. Showers and thunderstorms 
continue across portions of Texas and New Mexico as a low-pressure 
storm pumps moisture into the west from Mexico. Temperatures will 
be in the 60s, 70s and 80s across the western United States with 50s 
in the rain-cooled areas of the southwest. 40s and 50s are expected 
for the Great Lakes. Temperatures across the virgin islands will be 
in the 80s. But strong tropical waves will mean a good chance of thunderstorms 
with heavy rain in some areas. Nome will be partly cloudy with a high 
temperature in the upper 20s. On the extended forecast, scattered 
showers remain in the desert southwest with thunderstorms across Florida 
and a mix of rain and snow in the northeast. These showers continue 
moving northeastward on Friday, but scattered rain continues in the 
desert southwest. Rain and winds in the forecast for the northwest 
by Saturday. The forecasts for more than 6,000 cities is at CNN.com.
