Germany's new center-left government wants to bring part of U.S. director 
Steven Spielberg's Shoah Visual History Foundation to Berlin instead 
of building a Holocaust Memorial, a newspaper reported Wednesday. 
Citing knowledgeable sources in Bonn, Der Tagesspiegel newspaper said 
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's designated culture secretary 
Michael Naumann wants to locate the center on the plot of land in 
central Berlin intended for the memorial. Naumann refused to confirm 
the plan, saying only: ``Just wait until (parliament) debates the 
memorial plan in the coming weeks and then we'll talk about the future.'' 
A spokesman for Schroeder's Social Democratic party had no immediate 
comment. Naumann is one of the most outspoken critics of the decade-old 
plan to erect a giant memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe in the 
heart of Berlin. He has said he would prefer to see the money be spent 
on Holocaust-related projects that would be more educational than 
an abstruse monument. The incoming government plans to let parliament 
debate the issue before deciding whether to proceed with the project. 
Spielberg's foundation is an archive of nearly 50,000 filmed interviews 
with Holocaust survivors.
