When bats fly, evil lurks. No, not that kind of evil. Forget crosses, 
wooden stakes, Hollywood Transylvanians and children of the night. 
Above all, forget what Bob Benson, public relations director at Bat 
Conservation International (www.batcon.org), calls ``Bram Stoker's 
infamous novel.'' The real evil, bat enthusiasts say, is ignorance 
and fear about one of nature's most remarkable and, from a human perspective, 
most useful animals. ``It's vastly more dangerous to have dogs in 
your neighborhood than bats,'' said Dr. Merlin Tuttle, a wildlife 
biologist who founded Bat Conservation International in 1982. ``Only 
a very few years ago, nearly the entire world feared and avoided bats 
at all costs,'' Tuttle said in a telephone interview. ``Today, we're 
beginning to make a pretty dramatic difference.'' The difference shows. 
Tuttle, 57, moved the society from Milwaukee, where he was a museum 
curator, to Austin, Texas., in 1986, partly because the Congress Avenue 
Bridge in Austin had the largest urban bat population in North America 
_ 1.5 million. He also moved there because Austin was then what he 
called ``the negative story capital of the world,'' with alarmist 
tales of rabid swarms ready to sink their teeth into the citizenry. 
Today, the Congress Avenue Bridge (www.batcon.org/congress.html) is 
a tourist attraction. And Bat Conservation International has a $3.5 
million budget, 24 full-time employees and 14,000 members in 76 countries. 
Its vast array of information and links shows the power of the Internet 
as a teaching tool. The organization provides teachers' guides and 
a multimedia kit, ``Discover Bats.'' Members receive a quarterly magazine 
and its 15-year archives are on line. You can pay to adopt a bat on 
line, which works something like a foster parent plan _ including 
a ``letter'' from the bat and an 8-by-10 photo. Here are a few facts 
from the site: Bats are not blind, are not rodents and will not get 
tangled in your hair. Only one-half of 1 percent of bats are rabid, 
and most of them are too sick to fly. Bat droppings and urine cannot 
transmit rabies. You want to talk about blood? A single little brown 
bat can catch 600 mosquitoes an hour. Vampire bats even adopt orphans. 
And for some people, this may be the clincher: The seed production 
of agave plants drops to 1 3,000 of normal without bat pollinators. 
That's right: No bats, no tequila. One of the society's treasures 
is Tuttle's 80,000 slides of bats taken over the last 30 years. Many 
were first-ever shots of rare species at night. Bats have a false 
reputation for viciousness, Tuttle said, partly because when frightened 
they bare their teeth in self-defense. Such photos are often magnified, 
making the shy animals look like saber-toothed tigers. For the truly 
serious or scientific, a Swedish company, Pettersson Electronik (www.bahnhof.se/pettersson), 
sells ultrasonic bat detectors that can identify species by their 
sound waves. If that is a little dry for your taste, you can lighten 
up with jokes from a bat humor page (www.nyx.net/jbuzbee/bathouse.html(NU)Bat 
Humor) What prompts all this enthusiasm and Internet dedication for 
bats? Jim Buzbee, a 39-year-old software engineer for Lockheed Martin 
in Denver who maintains his own prodigious bat-link page (www.nyx.net/jbuzbee/bathouse.html), 
took a guess. ``It could be because bats are just more of an interesting 
topic compared to, say, turtles,'' he wrote by e-mail. ``Bats tend 
to stir emotions in people; witness all of the poetry people send 
me.''
