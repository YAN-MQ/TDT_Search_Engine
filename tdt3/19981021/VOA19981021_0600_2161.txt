NATO's top military commander has pressed Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to comply with international demands to end the conflict 
in Kosovo. U.S. officials said General Wesley Clark planned to warn 
the Yugoslav leader that NATO is prepared to use military force if 
he does not withdraw Serbian forces responsible for a crackdown on 
ethnic Albanian separatists. They met in Belgrade late yesterday. 
NATO has set a deadline of October 27th for the withdrawal, but there 
have been reports of renewed fighting.
