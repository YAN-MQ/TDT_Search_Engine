When Steve DeBerg's voice came over the conference call, before a 
question was even asked the 44-year-old quarterback of the Atlanta 
Falcons quipped: ``I hope you guys got the announcement that I retired 
this morning. This is not part of my deal. Mop-up duty was fine.'' 
It was only a joke, but it would be no more unlikely than the fact 
that DeBerg could find himself starting at Giants Stadium against 
the Jets on Sunday. But more than five years after he played his last 
game _ which included two seasons on the sideline at Giants Stadium 
as an assistant coach for the Giants under his current head coach, 
Dan Reeves, and closer to Social Security benefits than he is to the 
day he was drafted into the National Football League _ DeBerg could 
find himself in a starting role. Chris Chandler, the Falcons' starting 
quarterback, bruised his left shoulder last week as Atlanta improved 
its record to 5-1. Reeves said that Chandler is doubtful for Sunday's 
game, and the job then falls to DeBerg. And while DeBerg's physical 
skills may have diminished over the years, he is one of the few players 
who truly is a coach on the field. ``You never lose the mind,'' said 
the Jets' Bryan Cox, who played with DeBerg in Miami. ``If you lose 
something physically, you still have that. He knows how to break down 
a defense.'' But exactly what DeBerg can do on the field is questionable. 
When he left the game at 39, he had thrown for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns 
in his final game. He worked out on his own last year, and this summer 
sent letters out to a number of teams indicating that he was interested 
in playing again. One of the letters was sent to Reeves, but when 
addressing the envelope the letter fell out and Reeves received an 
empty envelope. Reeves called to ask about it, and as DeBerg explained, 
he was unaware that Reeves was in an emergency situation, with Mark 
Rypien, his recently signed backup, putting his career on hold to 
tend to a family matter. After three games of holding the clipboard, 
DeBerg saw his first regular-season action in the Falcons' fourth 
game and completed 1 of 2 passes. He played the final nine minutes 
against the Giants the next week, but did not throw a pass. Then last 
week, when Chandler was hurt in the second quarter, DeBerg took over, 
and after a slow start that included being tackled for a safety, he 
finished 7 of 10 for 60 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions 
in a 31-23 victory over the Saints. ``I'm not exactly sure,'' DeBerg 
said Wednesday when he was asked where his physical talent level was 
now. ``But I know my knowledge level is as high as maybe anybody that's 
ever played the game. It still remains to be seen where the physical 
performance level is. I haven't been sore at all.'' The Jets who know 
DeBerg, though, do not doubt his skills. Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde 
took DeBerg's job in Tampa Bay as a rookie in 1987 and then played 
with him again in 1992. The two remain close, living near each other 
in Tampa, Fla. Besides spending a lot of time together on the golf 
course, the two worked out in Testaverde's yard this summer. ``He's 
a good friend of mine,'' Testaverde said. ``I'm happy that he's doing 
what he enjoys doing. We work out in the off season a little bit. 
I know he's in good shape. I don't care how old he is. I know he can 
handle it.'' Asked if he could imagine playing in the National Football 
League when he is 44, Testaverde, who turns 35 next month, said, ``I'm 
just glad I'm playing at this age.'' Keith Byers, who played in the 
Miami Dolphins backfield during DeBerg's last professional game in 
1993, said, ``It shows something about his resolve and his knowledge 
of the game. There's no sense wasting time trying to fool him.'' Cox 
added: ``I'll tell you what, he studies defenses as well as anybody 
I know. The guy would be in meetings before the coaches. The guy brings 
fun to the game. He comes out to practice in shoes from 1968, with 
a helmet with no face mask. He understands the game very well. I don't 
know what his arm strength is, but I know at that time he was a very 
capable quarterback.'' DeBerg said that he feels ready if the opportunity 
comes. ``I did coach and I realized what I did was a lot more fun 
as a player than a coach,'' DeBerg said. ``I coached with a majority 
of these guys on this staff. I tease them that I do a lot less, get 
paid a lot more, and get to go home when their day is just half over. 
It makes me appreciate the experience lot more.''
