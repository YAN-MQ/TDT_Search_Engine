There was a headline in The New York Times Wednesday that said, ``The 
Holocaust as a Teaching Tool.'' The story was about the use of a CD-ROM, 
produced by Steven Spielberg, to bring the lessons of the Holocaust 
to a group of struggling high school students on Manhattan's Lower 
East Side. If the story had been about Alfonse D'Amato, the headline 
might have read, ``The Holocaust as a Political Tool.'' On Sunday, 
New York's undistinguished junior senator showed up at the Holocaust 
Memorial Wall on First Avenue, across from the United Nations, to 
claim, in effect, that his Jewish opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer, 
does not care as much as he should about issues of concern to Jewish 
voters. It was a very low blow, but we should expect that by now. 
You want ethnic politics? You want divisive politics? You want the 
trivialization of a profound and tragic moment in history? Welcome 
to the campaign of Al D'Amato. Listen to D'Amato's self-righteous 
ranting about one of Schumer's alleged offenses: ``He missed the vote 
to make the Capitol Rotunda available for a magnificent Holocaust 
commemoration ceremony. That's the difference. I've been there. I 
understand that you've got to be there.'' Been there? The vote to 
use the Capitol Rotunda was a routine measure that passed 406-0. To 
suggest somehow that missing that vote was an offense against the 
Jewish community was disgusting. The truth is that Al D'Amato is in 
the race of his life and has been flailing about from the beginning 
for an issue _ any issue _ that would stave off Schumer and secure 
for D'Amato a fourth six-year term in the Senate. As Judith Hope, 
the state Democratic chairman, remarked: ``There's nothing Al D'Amato 
would not do for a vote. He would have a carnival at a Holocaust memorial 
if he thought it would get him another vote.'' This election should 
have been about the fundamental differences between the two candidates 
_ on abortion, on gun control, on education and the environment, on 
foreign policy. But D'Amato is a particularly slippery politician 
who deftly conceals much of what he really stands for, while his outrageous 
attacks on his opponents get tremendous attention. Even now, after 
18 years in the Senate, most New York voters do not realize that he 
is one of the most unrelenting opponents of abortion in Congress, 
or that he has an abysmal record when it comes to support for federal 
aid to education. His instinct for the negative has served him well. 
He has turned back one Democratic challenger after another since the 
early 1980s. D'Amato has been a senator all of that time, but he has 
had a lot of trouble acting like one. If you want a sense of dignity 
with your senator, you will have to look elsewhere. D'Amato once criticized 
a Democratic anti-crime bill by standing up in the Senate and singing, 
to the tune of ``Old MacDonald Had a Farm'': ``President Clinton had 
a bill, E-I-E-I-O. And in that bill was lots of pork, E-I-E-I-O ...'' 
He had to apologize on the Senate floor in 1995 after he went on the 
radio and used a mock Japanese accent to ridicule Judge Lance Ito, 
the trial judge in the O.J. Simpson case. Four years ago, at a solemn 
ceremony in lower Manhattan at which ground was broken for the city's 
Holocaust memorial, D'Amato erupted in a thuggish display of threats 
and curses because he was dissatisfied with the seating arrangements. 
I wrote at the time: ``Onlookers were astonished as they watched Mr. 
D'Amato confront Martin Algaze, an aide to Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter. 
`I thought he was going to hit me,' said Mr. Algaze. `He said, ``I'm 
a U.S. senator! Who moved my seat?'' And then he started cursing.''' 
D'Amato apparently thought that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, with whom 
he was feuding, had ordered his seat moved to a less prominent spot. 
He said he would show Giuliani the difference ``between a United States 
senator and first-term mayor.'' Al D'Amato can't help himself. He 
may be a U.S. senator, but his instincts and behavior patterns are 
closer to those of a mindless, disrespectful adolescent. He's an embarrassment 
in search of six more years.
