Turkey says Syria has signed an accord pledging to stop supporting 
the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party and to shut its camps in Syria and 
the Syrian-controlled Becaa Valley in Lebanon. The agreement came 
after Turkish and Syrian officials concluded two days of talks late 
Tuesday in Turkey's southern city of Adana. Under the agreement, Syria 
will also brand the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party a terrorist organization.
