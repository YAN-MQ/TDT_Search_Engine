Palestinian officials in Hebron have rounded up close to 15 suspected 
Hamas militants following the arrest of a man whose house was allegedly 
used as a Hamas bomb factory. Local media reported Wednesday that 
the man is a top Hamas military leader. In a separate action, Palestinian 
police arrested 15 others who were suspected of having links to the 
Hamas member who injured 64 people in last Monday's grenade attack 
in southern Israel.
