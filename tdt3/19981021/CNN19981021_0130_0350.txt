NAto's military chief is warning Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
to speed up a troop withdrawal from Kosovo or risk air strikes as 
early as next week. Ethnic Albanians are demanding all government 
troops leave the province, or they will continue their fight for independence. 
Tuesday, relief workers were able to resume their work after violence 
in the area over the weekend. Humanitarian groups are trying to get 
150 tons of supplies to ethnic albanian refugees displaced by months 
of fighting.
