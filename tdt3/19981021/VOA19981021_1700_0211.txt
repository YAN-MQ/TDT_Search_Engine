A court in Sierra Leone has sentenced 11 civilians to death for their 
role in the coup last year after President Ahmed Tehan Caba died. 
Among those sentenced Wednesday by the country's high court is a 75-year-old 
former member of the city council of Freetown and two other women. 
The sentences bring the number of people condemned to death in connection 
with the May 1997 coup to 27. Sixteen others were sentenced to death 
last month.
