Russia's new government is focused on short-term measures to stabilize 
the economy and see the country through the winter, and a comprehensive 
recovery plan is not the top priority, a senior official was quoted 
as saying Wednesday. The government is facing growing criticism for 
not producing an economic blueprint to deal with the worst financial 
crisis since the Soviet Union imploded seven years ago. The crisis 
hit two months ago, and the government has so far implemented only 
stop-gap measures. Yuri Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister 
in charge of economic policy, said the government's emphasis was on 
preventing potential disasters, such as food shortages, this winter. 
``The (long-term) program is still absent because we need time to 
make it sound,'' Maslyukov was quoted as saying in the newspaper Komsomolskaya 
Pravda. ``Moreover, it's still unclear how we can stabilize the economy.'' 
The government is broke and the crisis has made it even more difficult 
than usual to collect taxes. Also, foreign lenders have frozen additional 
loans to Russia until the government produces a program to address 
the long list of economic problems. ``We should first take a series 
of emergency steps that would allow us to stabilize the situation, 
live through the winter and avert hunger,'' Maslyukov added. The country 
presently has plenty of food, but a bad fall harvest and sharp drops 
in imported foods have raised concerns. No serious food shortages 
are expected this winter, but the government has created a dlrs 600 
million emergency food reserve that could feed one-third of the population 
for two weeks. Russia desperately needs cash to pay its bills for 
the rest of the year, and has been counting on loans from a dlrs 22.6 
billion bailout package negotiated with the International Monetary 
Fund before the economic crisis erupted in mid-August. An IMF delegation 
is visiting Russia to review economic conditions, but is not expected 
to recommend the release of additional loan installments. If the government 
does not receive foreign help, it may have to print more money, a 
move that would stoke inflation. Prices have gone up about 50 percent 
this year and could rise by 200 or 300 percent by year's end, the 
government has forecast. Maslyukov said the government wanted to limit 
the amount of money printed. ``Printing money that is not properly 
backed is dangerous for the economy and may push it into hyperinflation 
and chaos,'' he said. In other developments Wednesday: _ The State 
Tax Service has drawn up a tax payment schedule for 14 of the country's 
biggest companies. The tax service will release frozen accounts and 
confiscated property when the companies pay their tax bills, Russian 
news agencies said. _ The Russian ruble should be in a range of 17 
to 20 against the U.S. dollar for the rest of the year, government 
officials said. The ruble was trading Wednesday at about 17, compared 
to six when the crisis hit in August. _ Parliament's lower house passed 
a bill that would guarantee the savings accounts of individuals who 
had their accounts frozen by ailing banks. However, it was not clear 
where the government would get the money to cover the costs.
