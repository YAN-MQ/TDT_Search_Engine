Coastguards launched a rescue operation Wednesday after a Dutch sailing 
ship with 51 people on board ran aground in high winds and seas off 
the southern English port of Newhaven. Authorities said the entire 
crew was winched in pairs off the Eendracht, a 115-foot (35-meter) 
training ship, by a coastguard helicopter after initial attempts to 
refloat the ship failed. Coastguard manager Kerry Woodard said the 
ship had suffered engine failure shortly after leaving Newhaven port. 
``The weather caught hold of her and she went side-on to the sea. 
She was broached onto the beach,'' he said. ``There was a definite 
danger of capsizing early on. All it would have needed was the right 
wave and the wind in the right direction and she would have been over.'' 
Several people suffered minor injuries during the rescue operation 
and were treated on shore. One person was taken to hospital. Initially, 
a skeleton crew remained on the boat to help lift it from the beach, 
but they were evacuated after a coastguard tug failed to steady the 
vessel. ``She was getting battered. The decision was made between 
the skipper and coastguards to get everybody off and leave it to later 
on this evening on another rising tide,'' Woodard said.
