Ukrainian agricultural companies owe the government 3.5 million metric 
tons (3.85 million short tons) of grain in return for machinery and 
seeds received on credit in 1997-98, the agriculture minister said 
Wednesday. The companies are reluctant to pay the debt, worth 812.4 
million hryvna (dlrs 237 million), Agriculture Minister Borys Supykhanov 
told a Cabinet meeting. He also said agricultural producers were slow 
in repaying the government for foreign-made combine harvesters and 
other machinery bought with the help of government-guaranteed foreign 
loans. In 1998, producers had to provide about 1 million metric tons 
(1.1 million short tons) as payment for these loans, Supykhanov noted. 
The Cabinet decided Wednesday to reprimand the head of the state-run 
Khlib Ukrainy bread company and four regional administration chiefs 
for their failure to control and account in time for cash and other 
credits to the country's agricultural sector, the Interfax news agency 
reported.
