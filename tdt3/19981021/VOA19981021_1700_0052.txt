President Clinton has temporarily suspended his personal role in the 
Middle East summit near Washington, this as the Israeli and Palestinian 
delegations examine a U.S.-drafted document to bridge the gaps barring 
an interim security accord. VOA's David Gollas reports from the White 
House. Mr. Clinton had spent three consecutive afternoons with the 
parties at the Wye Plantation, but he kept his distance Wednesday 
with aides saying his return depends on whether Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright believes it would be productive. The change in 
approach coincides with confirmation from spokesman Joe Lockhart that 
the administration has tabled a document aimed at closing the gaps 
barring the way to the long-delayed interim accord. It seeks to codify 
some things where there may be agreement and focus attention on the 
tough decisions that still be - still need to be made, where significant 
gaps remain. So it is a working document that moves toward what would 
be a deal or an agreement. Mr. Lockhart advised caution about reports 
the summit might be on the verge of breakup. And he declined to speculate 
as to when it might end, saying the administration will continue its 
role as long as it believes both parties are working seriously toward 
an agreement. Davis Gollas, VOA NEWS, the White House.
