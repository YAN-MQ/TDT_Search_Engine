Russia is continuing to reduce its troops along the Chinese border, 
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Wednesday. Sergeyev said that 
so far this year Russia has disbanded or cut 300 military units stationed 
near the 4,200-kilometer (2,500-mile) border with its eastern neighbor, 
the Interfax news agency said. The report did not give the number 
of soldiers removed, or any other details. Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin agreed last year to a final 
demarcation of the border and to reduce military activities along 
it. Sergeyev arrived in China from Vietnam on Wednesday. He is scheduled 
to hold talks with his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian and to meet 
with Jiang on Friday. After decades of friction, relations between 
Moscow and Beijing have improved dramatically in recent years as China 
has become a major trading partner and a leading customer for Russia's 
struggling defense industries. Russia views the new relationship with 
China as a counterbalance to what it sees as U.S. pre-eminence in 
global affairs.
