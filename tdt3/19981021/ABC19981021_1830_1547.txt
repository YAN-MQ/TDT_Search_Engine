Finally tonight, always leave them laughing. In India, it is "the 
way they live." This week we've seen how some people in Greece and 
Japan manage to have unusually long and healthy lives because they 
eat well and are productive. From India tonight, a somewhat different 
take on what it takes to live a Better life. As Mark Twain once said, 
"against the assault of laughter nothing can stand." ABC's Mark Litke 
reports from Bombay. With some of the most congested, polluted, nerve-rattling 
cities on the planet, the people of India could tell you a thing or 
two about stress. It's a problem taken seriously here. Very seriously. 
From the land that brought us yoga and transcendental meditation, 
now comes the laughter club, the absolute latest in stress-reduction 
therapy. Once a week people gather in cities all over India, this 
is Bombay. For a half hour of organized giggling and guffawing, guaranteed, 
they say, to melt away the tensions of modern life and improve one's 
health. This exercise is giving energy to our body. Once again, we 
feel like we're young. They certainly act a lot younger as well. Life 
is too serious. Dr. madan kataria is the one who launched this craze. 
After years of observing how his patients immune systems always improved 
following bouts of laughter, no matter what the ailment. Heart disease, 
peptic ulcer, insomnia, psychiatric problems, depression and all. 
Laughter, he says, is the ultimate cost-effective therapy. It's free 
and easy to pass around. Much too easy for a serious interview. What 
the doctor did was simply devise a laughter routine to exercise different 
parts of the body. The silent laugh. The lion laugh. The argument 
laugh. At the end of each session, people are so pumped up, they feel 
they can take on the world. Laughter alone is the solution. No question 
about it. The world could certainly use a little more medicine like 
this. Mark Litke, ABC News, trying to keep a straight face, in Bombay, 
India.
