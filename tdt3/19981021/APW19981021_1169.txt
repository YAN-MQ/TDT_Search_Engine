Frenchman Henri Leconte was forced to default his opening match in 
the Champions senior tennis tournament Wednesday after slipping on 
the fake clay surface. Leconte hurt himself in the opening set against 
former dual Australian Open champion Johan Kriek and packed up for 
the day with Kriek leading 6-3, 2-0. Leconte said the surface, which 
imitates clay but is much quicker, needed to be adjusted. He pulled 
out mainly as a precautionary measure and said he expected to be fit 
to play Argentinian Guillermo Vilas on Thursday. Vilas was beaten 
6-2, 7-6 by Australian Pat Cash in the second singles match. John 
McEnroe scored a comfortable straight-sets win over Australian John 
Fitzgerald in the night session while Bjorn Borg also won. McEnroe, 
who heads the points table for the senior tour, defeated Fitzgerald 
6-4, 6-2. Borg overpowered Englishman John Lloyd 6-3, 6-2. (djp)
