You may have heard HMO patients complain about their medical care, 
and some doctors are fed up, too. 550 Texas physicians are terminating 
their contracts with Aetna/U.S. healthcare. Many doctors in Colorado, 
Georgia and Florida also are leaving their HMOs. They say they don't 
get paid enough, spend too much time on red tape and want to make 
life easier for themselves and their patients.
