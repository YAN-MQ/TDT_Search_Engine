Fame and infamy alike can seal a person's name into the mind of America. 
And they spoil a good name too. Jill Brooke has that. The sun in my 
sky For the singer Monica, the tennis player Monica and anyone else 
named Monica, life is no longer the same because of this Monica. When 
you're introduced to people, you sort of get a knowing smile, and 
then i'm usually hit with the typical barrage of Clinton/Lewinsky 
jokes. So, I'm always aware of having the first name now. Making matters 
worse, author Monica Crowley worked for a President and is often asked 
to comment on the scandal. I've had several national news anchors 
introduce me on live television as monica Lewinsky. So there's a freudian 
slip for you. Unless, of course, you are actually named Monica Lewinsky. 
Now how has this changed your life? I mean, does it -- does it make 
it difficult to move around and -- Well, yeah, actually one thing 
my friends say about me is that I'm a Serious person -- Right. So, 
nobody takes me seriously anymore. Talk about serious double entendres. 
In baby books, the name "Monica" means adviser. But this Monica's 
advice is to not use that. That's not a good name to have. But some 
names have some positive political associations. The name truman is 
suddenly very popular. It's the name of one Tom Hank's and Rita Wilson's 
son. Truman, what are you doing here? Jim Carey's character was named 
truman Burbank in "the truman show." And will truman is the character 
on NBC's "will and grace." And when writer Jon hensleigh wanted to 
convey a character who had moral integrity and the ability to help 
save the world, he devised the name Dan truman for the NASA chief 
in the film "Armageddon." The name certainly conjures up the memories 
of the 33rd president, you know? And was I searching for that? Yes, 
absolutely. He's, you know, talking straight, shooting straight kind 
of guy. And I think Americans want that, definitely. Yet despite Monica 
on "friends," it is unlikely we'll see many monicas in the near future. 
I have 40 screen plays in development right now, all with lead characters 
named Monica. I'll have to change every one of them. No, I'm joking. 
I'm joking, joking -- kidding. Because in the world of monic-earth, 
truman is hot while Monica is not. Jill Brooke, "CNN Entertainment 
News," New York.
