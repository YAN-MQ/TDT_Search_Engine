Flight 503 was carrying a mockup of Eutelsat's W2 satellite and an 
``Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator,'' the European Space Agency said 
earlier. The first Ariane 5 crashed in June 1996 and another launch 
was less-than-perfect since then. Wednesday's third launch was critical 
for the rocket, which officials see as a vehicle to boost Europe's 
commercial space launch industry even further along its success route. 
ESA said in June that trouble with the Ariane 5 -- with twice the 
power and payload capacity of the Ariane 4 -- forced officials to 
switch a Eutelsat satellite to an Ariane 4. In February, Arianespace 
admitted that the rocket experienced a spin problem on its test launch 
last Oct. 30. Arianespace, the business arm of the European Space 
Agency, dominates the world's commercial launch market, competing 
with U.S., Russian and Chinese firms.
