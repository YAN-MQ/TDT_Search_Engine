A couple in Portland, Oregon, is celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary. 
Fred and Gwen landis got engaged the day after their first Kiss. That 
was in 1928, before the great depression. Both are 94 years old now. 
They say the keys to their longevity have been no smoking or drinking, 
and lots of prayers and vitamins. Every day, they still tell each 
other, "I love you."
