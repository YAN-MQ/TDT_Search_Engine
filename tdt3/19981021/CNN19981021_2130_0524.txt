This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather" 
forecast for Thursday. We'll continue to see wet weather across the 
western part of the country, especially the southwest with some showers 
and storms along the cold front from Texas through the gulf coast 
into Florida. A trough of low pressure moving across the northeast 
could produce a few rain showers as well. Cool, high pressure though 
will settle into much of the eastern United States. Highs on Thursday 
will just be in 40s and 50s from New England into the Great Lakes, 
in the Ohio valley and into the mid-atlantic. Look for mostly 70s 
in the gulf coast. Some 70s in the northern plains and 70s and 80s 
through the desert southwest. Looking ahead to Friday, showers will 
continue across the southwest with some moving into the northwest. 
On Saturday, the wet weather will be across the northwest. Sunday, 
still scattered showers northwest and through the great basin. Things 
do warm up just a bit across the eastern United States, there will 
be 50s over northern New England, some 80s in Florida. Don't forget, 
you can find four-day forecasts for 6,100 cities on CNN interactive 
at CNN.com.
