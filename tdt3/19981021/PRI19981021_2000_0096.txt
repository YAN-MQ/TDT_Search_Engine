President Clinton today signed a $520 billion spending package that 
passed the Senate today as the 105th Congress wrapped up its final 
day of legislation. As one of its last official acts before leaving 
for the year, the Senate today confirmed the nomination of Dr. Jane 
Haney to serve as commissioner of the Food & Drug Administration. 
NPR's Julie Robner reports. The agency that regulates a quarter of 
all products sold in the United States has been without a permanent 
leader since David Kessler left in February of 1997. President Clinton 
nominated Haney, a cancer researcher, former FDA official, and current 
head of the University of New Mexico's medical school in June. The 
conservative Republicans in the Senate held up her approval. They 
said FDA has been too political, particularly in trying to curb tobacco 
use and encouraging approval of the controversial abortion pill, RU486. 
On Tuesday, following days of negotiations, Assistant Senate Majority 
Leader Don Nichols endorsed Haney's nomination after she promised 
not to overstep the agency's authority. Nichols' backing convinced 
other conservatives to drop their objections as well. Julie Robner,
