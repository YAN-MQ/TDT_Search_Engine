Foreign loans are like drugs that give Russia a short-term ``high,'' 
but do nothing to develop the economy, Moscow's mayor said Wednesday 
as the Russian government began new talks with the International Monetary 
Fund. The finance minister, meanwhile, acknowledged the battered ruble 
is not likely to strengthen this year, and a deputy prime minister 
admitted a comprehensive economic recovery plan has been shelved in 
favor of measures to prevent a food shortage or other crises this 
winter. ``These injections (of foreign loans) made our country high 
for a while,'' Luzhkov said. But the IMF's failure to monitor how 
the money was spent meant the loans were ``totally useless for the 
government and the country'' and allowed the government to ignore 
problems in the economy, he said. Luzhkov, a presidential hopeful 
in 2000, was speaking at a conference in London promoting investment 
opportunities in the Russian capital. Back home in Moscow, IMF officials 
began talks with Finance Ministry officials about a dlrs 22.6 billion 
bailout package that was frozen after the worst economic crisis since 
the collapse of the Soviet Union erupted in mid-August. Russia has 
received only dlrs 4.8 billion of the loan and says it is counting 
on more to pay its bills for the rest of the year. The IMF insists 
it first wants to see the government's plan to cope with the crisis, 
and signs that it is being implemented. First Deputy Prime Minister 
Yuri Maslyukov said Wednesday that a comprehensive recovery plan was 
not the government's top priority. Instead, it was focusing on short-term 
measures to stabilize the economy and see the country through the 
winter without food shortages or other disasters, he said. Finance 
Minister Mikhail Zadornov made similar comments earlier this month. 
Zadornov told Echo Moskvy radio on Wednesday he expects the IMF will 
release some more money this year, but not the full dlrs 4.3 billion 
payment that was held back in September. ``The (long-term) program 
is still absent because we need time to make it sound,'' Maslyukov 
was quoted as telling Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. ``Moreover, 
it's still unclear how we can stabilize the economy.'' ``We should 
first take a series of emergency steps that would allow us to stabilize 
the situation, live through the winter and avert hunger,'' Maslyukov 
added. Russia currently has plenty of food, but a bad harvest and 
sharp drops in imported foods have raised concerns. The finance minister 
said Wednesday he is very cautious about such aid, but ``maybe it 
will be important.'' Zadornov also said the Russian currency was not 
likely to rise above 17 to 20 rubles to the U.S. dollar for the rest 
of the year, ITAR-Tass reported. The ruble was trading Wednesday at 
about 17.3 to the dollar, compared to 6.2 when the crisis hit in August.
