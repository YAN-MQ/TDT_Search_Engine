Now "living longer, living better" and a new study about to be released 
on one of the most common life changes as we age -- sleep habits. 
Most of us wind up having a harder time getting to sleep or staying 
asleep. And women tend to have more trouble than men. why? Here's 
NBC's Fred Francis. a tired nation -- fully 132 million of us complain 
about our sleep. And for women and men over 50, the night is often 
a frustrating, ragged, 6.9 hours of rest. Research shows it is worse 
for women. By day, 61-year-old camille Petty runs a pediatric unit 
at New York's bellevue hospital. By night, she says, "I'm a mess." 
And I probably will sleep about 1:00 and wake up about 3:00 and then 
wait until it's time for me to get up. In a study to be released tomorrow, 
the national sleep foundation finds that older women sleep almost 
two hours less a week than younger women, often because of hormonal 
changes. Sleep before menopause was a very comforting kind of sleep. 
Very relaxes. Now, sleep is helter-skelter. Like camille, one in five 
older women sleep less than six hours a Night during the work week. 
Only two in five catch up on rest on the weekend by sleeping eight 
hours or more. Not surprising, 56% of them complain of insomnia symptoms. 
It may be caused by stress. It may be caused by hot flashes. It may 
be caused by other health conditions. It may be caused by pain. But 
the problem of insomnia is one that many women experience. Dr. helene 
emsellem says we punish our bodies with irregular sleep habits. We 
get in bed these days with the TV running. Our laptop computer is 
in bed with us. We may have gone to bed at 2:00 A.M. last night So 
what is the cost? Sleepiness on the road kills 1,500 people a year. 
It costs companies up to $107 billion in lost productivity. And it 
cost us almost $16 billion in doctors' bills. So, to sleep better, 
minimize evening exercise. Cut out alcohol. It actually disrupts sleep. 
And go to bed each night at the same time. And consult your doctor 
whether you need sleeping pills. 20% of older women use them. And 
doctors say more should, along with other changes, to "live long and 
live better." Fred Francis, NBC news, Washington.
