There's a small mystery tonight involving John Glenn, who is scheduled 
to become the oldest person in space when his shuttle flight lifts 
off a week from tomorrow. Glenn, who's 77, has been dropped from a 
sleep experiment because of some kind of physical condition, but no 
one will say what it is. NBC's Robert Bazell tonight. No one is saying 
John Glenn is in any danger. But there is some reason why he cannot 
participate in a key sleep experiment on his upcoming shuttle flight. 
Neither the senator nor NASA is saying what it is. It's not unprecedented. 
We have had it happen before. The experiment tests the effects of 
melatonin -- a natural hormone commonly sold in health food stores 
-- on the sleep of astronauts in space. Before anyone knew Glenn would 
fly the shuttle, Dr. Charles czeiler, who heads the experiment, drew 
up a list of conditions that would keep astronauts from participating 
in the test. It is a long list that ranges from serious medical and 
psychiatric problems to minor difficulties such as mild sleep disorders. 
We found that he didn't meet one of the criteria that we had specified 
long ago when we had initially designed these experiments as part 
of our investigator approval from the FDA for giving melatonin. And 
so we didn't have any choice but not to include him in that aspect 
of the experiment. Federal laws about patient confidentially prohibit 
the doctor and nASA from revealing what the problem is. Glenn could 
say what it is, but so far he is refusing. NasA points out that Glenn 
will fly the shuttle as planned and take part in other experiments. 
And NASA regulations prohibit anyone from flying whose health could 
endanger the mission. Glenn's other experiments will monitor his sleep 
with a tangle of measuring devices and watch for a loss of muscle 
caused by the weightlessness of space. The theory is that space travel 
rapidly brings on many of the problems caused by natural aging and 
that Glenn's 77-year-old body will provide information about both. 
There is no indication that Glenn's problem, whatever it is, will 
stop him from successfully completing his other experiments while 
he is in space. Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
