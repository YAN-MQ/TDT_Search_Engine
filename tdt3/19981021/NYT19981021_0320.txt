The Clinton administration, increasing the pressure on oil companies 
to build a pipeline for Caspian Sea oil that suits U.S. interests, 
said Wednesday that it would give Turkey $823,000 to help plan its 
part of the line. As oil company executives appear close to making 
a recommendation on a pipeline route, the United States is making 
a major push for a plan that would send oil across Turkey to the Mediterranean 
port of Ceyhan. Administration officials say a pipeline along this 
route would help stabilize the region and serve long-term U.S. interests. 
``Over all, Baku-Ceyhan offers the best option from environmental, 
economic and strategic standpoints,'' said Undersecretary of State 
Stuart Eizenstat. ``No one should underestimate our determination 
to make Baku-Ceyhan a reality.'' Oil companies favor the U.S.-backed 
pipeline route but believe that its projected cost of $2.8 billion 
makes it too costly to build anytime soon. Indeed, some executives 
believe that the project could cost $4 billion or more. Eizenstat's 
announcements were apparently part of a last-minute campaign to make 
it more economical. ``The idea is to give Turkey financial help to 
lay the groundwork for this project,'' said an official in Ankara 
who was briefed on this week's meetings. ``It's to help Turkey prepare 
a financial package, figure out how to line up financing and firm 
up details of the route.'' Executives of oil companies active in the 
Caspian region said Wednesday that they still favor a shorter pipeline 
route running from Baku, the capital of oil-rich Azerbaijan, to the 
Georgian port of Supsa on the Black Sea. Eizenstat concluded three 
days of meetings with Turkish officials on Wednesday. He said that 
the Trade and Development Agency, which supports U.S. business projects 
abroad, would provide the money to Turkey. He is one of several top 
administration officials who are traveling to push for the Baku-Ceyhan 
route. Jan Kalicki, a senior Commerce Department envoy, was in Azerbaijan 
last weekend. President Clinton's special envoy to the Caspian region, 
Richard Morningstar, and the head of the Trade and Development Agency, 
are due in Istanbul next week. The discovery of large amounts of oil 
and gas under and around the Caspian has attracted dozens of energy 
companies to what may be the century's last big bonanza. Because the 
new nations in the region are unstable and wedged into a strategic 
region between Russia and Iran, they have also become an arena for 
big-power competition. The decision on where to build an oil-export 
pipeline could have profound geopolitical as well as economic effects. 
Oil companies active in the Caspian _ among them Exxon, Pennzoil and 
the newly merged BP-Amoco _ are expected to announce soon which pipeline 
route they favor. Officially they are making only a recommendation 
to the government of Azerbaijan. Since they will pay for the pipeline, 
however, their recommendation is likely to be decisive. A spokeswoman 
for the oil consortium, Pamela Mounter, said executives hoped to recommend 
a pipeline route next week. ``Our contract calls for us to make a 
draft recommendation to the Azerbaijani government on a pipeline route.'' 
Ms. Mounter said in a telephone interview from Baku. ``The deadline 
is the end of this month, and we hope to meet that deadline.'' Ms. 
Mounter said executives of the oil consortium were not available for 
comment, because ``they are working flat-out to meet the deadline.'' 
Asked if their recommendation would be made public, she replied, ``Yes, 
to the right people.'' An executive close to the consortium, however, 
said intense international interest would probably force the companies 
to make their recommendation fully public. ``The recommendation is 
being made to Socar,'' the executive said, referring to Azerbaijan's 
state-owned oil company. ``They've asked for a delay of a week or 
two because they're still working on next year's budget and some other 
matters that have to be discussed at the meeting. It's a legitimate 
delay, nothing horribly nefarious. The basic facts haven't changed.'' 
Published reports suggesting that the companies will not recommend 
immediate construction of a pipeline across Turkey have set off waves 
of protest and denial in several countries. ``Baku-Ceyhan will definitely 
be constructed,'' President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey assured anxious 
Turks. ``It is the safest route and has the backing of the United 
States.'' In Washington, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott 
told Turkish journalists that ``an obituary for the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline 
is at least premature and, we believe, wrong and inaccurate.'' Clinton's 
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, has announced plans to meet 
with senior oil executives to discuss the pipeline project. ``Nobody 
seems to know what he's going to say or to whom,'' said a specialist 
in Caspian oil issues who asked not to be identified. ``It's fairly 
unclear to all of us.'' The date originally set for the companies' 
announcement, Oct. 29, is also the 75th anniversary of the founding 
of the Turkish Republic. The presidents of Azerbaijan and Georgia 
will be in Turkey for the celebrations, and they are expected to join 
Demirel in a statement committing themselves to the Baku-Ceyhan route. 
Since their governments will not be putting up the money for the pipeline, 
however, the statement will be largely symbolic. A short-lived military 
uprising in Georgia this week reflected the fragility of the new nations 
around the Caspian, and forced a one-day halt in work on a small-gauge 
oil pipeline being built across Georgian territory. President Eduard 
Shevardnadze of Georgia blamed the uprising on forces opposed to the 
construction of an oil pipeline across his country. In the past, he 
has charged that Russia is fomenting instability in his country. Russia 
wants the main export pipeline built across its territory instead 
of across Georgia. ``For five or six years we have been doing everything 
possible to solve problems over the construction of the oil pipeline, 
and they are trying to interfere with that,'' Shevardnadze said. ``Fortunately 
this adventure is over, and Georgia has shown that it can defend its 
democracy. I have received many letters from big oil companies saying 
they are ready to continue cooperation with Georgia.''
