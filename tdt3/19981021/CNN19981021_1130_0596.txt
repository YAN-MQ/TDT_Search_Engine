A new study indicates smokers' habits are beginning to change. Susan 
Candiotti has details. Occasional smoking is on the rise. A new Gallup 
poll finds more people are smoking five or fewer cigarettes a day.

or less than smoking more. No matter how much they light up, the survey 
finds two-thirds of smokers believe they will die if they don't quit. 
They're beginning to realize just how lethal smoking is. The poll 
also shows a larger number of smokers, 36%, very interested in snuffing 
out their habit. Half of those surveyed are turning to light or low-tar 
cigarettes. But former FDA commissioner David Kessler says that's 
not necessarily good news. Tobacco companies, I think, have lulled 
people into this erroneous notion that light cigarettes are a safe 
harbor. In fact, there's no such thing as a safe cigarette. The survey 
shows the average times smokers attempt to quit remains about the 
same -- seven. The Gallup poll was funded by smithkline Beecham, which 
markets nicotine patches and gum. Studies also show that a quarter 
of all smokers time their attempts to quit to a special event, like 
new year's day. Which is why, not so Coincidentally, the Gallup poll 
was released just three weeks from the American cancer society's upcoming 
great American smokeout, November 19th. Susan Candiotti, CNN, New
