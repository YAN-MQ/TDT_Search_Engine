Move over, Joe camel, you've got company when it comes to controversial 
advertising symbols. A researcher says clever ads for beer, like the 
budweiser talking frogs, are registering with kids and teenagers. 
The study shows children who watch such ads are at a higher risk of 
drinking more alcohol more often when they get older. The American 
academy of pediatrics heard results of a 12-year study which contradicted 
arguments by beverage companies that their ads do not make young people 
drink. One children's advocate singled out the talking frogs commercials. 
If anything they say about their intent, not to create problems with 
underage drinking, if any of that is true, they should have pulled 
the ad immediately, and the reasons they didn't pull it is because 
that population is precisely who they want. A spokesman for the beer 
institute said his industry tries to avoid advertising on programs 
where a majority of viewers are underage.
