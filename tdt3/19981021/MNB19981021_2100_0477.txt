Today President Clinton signed that half a trillion dollar spending 
into law. The budget is 4,000 pages long, it weighs 40 pounds. It 
is 16 inches thick. As documents go, a big one. Congress was in such 
a hurry to wrap up business for the year and get out of tourn that 
no one knows how much the details at this point or what's hidden in 
those 4,000 pages. NBC news correspondent Gwen Ifill tonight on just 
what they're finding out about what some members of Congress managed 
to ad on at the last minute. $520 billion $CONGRESS enacted a budget 
Bill today that breaks the one promise they said they would keep, 
protecting the budget for social security. We don't pay social security. 
We don't return to taxpayers hard earned money, but we can spend a 
little more on pork. Pork. Special projects added for some lawmakers 
while others like Frank wolf a re ublican who once had support for 
a trucking reform Bill, found themselves out in the cold. Can you 
imagine a family in a wind Starr with four kids coming back from Disney 
on route 95 and you got a truck a detect 23 I have I truck barreling 
down on them? Can you imagine wolf's surprise when his own party leaders 
betrayed him during the final hours of horse trading over the federal 
budget all because the American trucking association objected? There 
is no evidence that suggests that the fatal accident rate for heavy 
trucks is on the rise. Wolf's measure was one of dozens of items deleted 
or added at the last minute from a 40-pound, 40,000-page pack G of 
spending mesh shus. No member of Congress should be able to spleep 
with themselves tonight knowing they voted for a Bill they have no 
idea what is in here. Which brings us to the beach on lake Michigan. 
Arkansas congressman Jay Dickey owns a vacation home there. He originally 
wanted $3 million for sand to restore the beach. He later backed down, 
but the budget still calls for a study of the beach problem. No one 
admits putting it there. Then there's $300 million worth of roads, 
fisheries, and grasshopper research, snagged by Alaska senator Ted 
Stevens. He happens to chair the budget-writing committee. Do I know 
what's in the Bill? Are you kidding? no. There's really no shame in 
these things. Most lawmakers immediately put out press releases of 
the goodies they got. In an election year, this bringing home of bacon 
works.
