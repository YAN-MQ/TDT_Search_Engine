the International Football Federation's Women's World Cup organizing 
committee is conducting its venue tour for next year's championship 
here in the United States. On Monday, officials paid a visit to Jack 
Kent Cooke Stadium outside of Washington, the home of the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. Sports editor Park Brewer has more. As officials toured 
the year-old stadium, brightly colored lights on the huge end zone 
scoreboards flashed out "Welcome FIFA ", the nickname for soccer's 
world governing body. Next to that, the huge video screen showed highlights 
of the last women's world cup in Sweden three years ago. This tour 
is critical in finalizing decisions on ticketing, technology, press 
operations, television and hospitality. FIFA's chairman for the Women's 
World Cup, Norwegian Per Undall, told VOA sports Jack Kent Cooke Stadium 
is top in the world among facilities not designed exclusively for 
soccer. That's probably the best stadium I ever saw also suitable 
for soccer, maybe competing with a stadium in Saudi Arabia, the King 
Fahd Stadium. But the variety in facilities here is by far better. 
Women's World Cup games next year will also be played in such cities 
as Chicago, New York and Boston. The FIFA tour ends Friday at the 
Rose Bowl outside Los Angeles, where the 1999 championship match will 
be held July 10th. I'm Park Brewer, VOA SPORTS.
