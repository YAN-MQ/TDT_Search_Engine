The picture is shocking. Jordan's king Hussein now gaunt from three 
months of chemotherapy for cancer. In July, the king told his people 
it's not fatal. Chemotherapy. And this week, the cancer did not stop 
him from pilotting his own jet from his treatments at the may Joe 
clinic in Minnesota to try to save the summit. With him, his wife, 
helping him fight the disease. He and I see this as yet another battle 
to fight and to win. Quoon noor of Jordan born and raised in America, 
part grace Kelly, part political activist. Every day brings us better 
news. The first few days were quite harrowing. They came as a shock 
to us when he was diagnosed. A Princeton graduate, she met the king 
22 years ago while working in Jordan. So began what friend call a 
storybook romance but set in a country surrounded by war. And unfortunately, 
a region that is considered the land Mines heartland of the world. 
So, in addition to caring for her husband, she's also crew saiding 
to rid the world of land Mines. What do you think you can bring to 
this whole subject of land Mines? Well, a lot of energy and I think 
a Middle Eastern perspective. Wars end, but land Mines intended to 
maim or kill enemies remain buried 50, even 100 years, regardless 
of who steps on them. 300,000 Mines in Jordan alone. So, she visits 
the wounded, lobbies world leaders, even while struggling with her 
own pefrpbl crisis far from his people and their struggle for peace. 
Is that a concern, his absence during a time when Israel and the Palestinians 
are at such loggerheads? Whatever need they might have of him, he'll 
be on the first plane back, as he put it, chemotherapy be damned. 
Ready to work for peace as the king proved again. But it may not be 
enough, and of course the other major player, Brian, who has so much 
at stake is Bill Clinton, who has invested 57 hours of personal diplomacy 
in this and stands ready to fly back tonight or tomorrow morning. 
But no one is calling upon him now. I know you'll stay with it tonight 
and be back with us if there's any change. Thanks. Thank you.
