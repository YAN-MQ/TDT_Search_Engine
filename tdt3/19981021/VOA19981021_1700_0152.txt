An Egyptian suspected in last year's massacre of 62 people at a popular 
tourist stop in Luxor, Egypt, has been arrested in Colombia. The head 
of Colombia's secret police says a suspect was taken into custody 
in Bogota Monday. The man was taken to the airport for extradition 
to Ecuador. The man is believed to be a member of a militant group 
that violently opposes Egypt's secular government.
