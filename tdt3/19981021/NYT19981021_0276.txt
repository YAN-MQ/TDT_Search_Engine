As schools increase technology budgets and parents rush to buy home 
computers, the value of computers in education has become a topic 
of debate. School administrators and teachers need to keep in mind 
that if they simply drop a lot of computers into the classroom, ``nothing 
miraculous is going to happen,'' said Sherry Turkle, a professor of 
the sociology of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
and author of two books on computers. ``The question is, how are they 
being used?'' Students need to be taught to read Web information with 
care, she said, and to ask questions like: Is this information accurate? 
Who wrote this? Does the writer have an ax to grind? Teachers also 
have to decide what is best taught by computer and what is not. For 
example, she said her 7-year-old daughter once had questions about 
magnets. A computer program about magnets didn't help so professor 
Turkle bought some. ``Once she was holding it in her hands, she got 
it,'' Turkle said. The computer isn't the best tool for teaching something 
like appreciation of certain literature, she added. ``You need a teacher 
and a conversation to teach the beauty of poetry,'' she said. While 
Turkle favors computers in the schools, she also urges school district 
officials to consider what they may be cutting to put the computers 
in classrooms. ``Schools really need to look carefully at the opportunity 
costs,'' she said. ``They need to make sure they've made a careful 
set of decisions about what is being taken out to let the computers 
in.'' Clifford Stoll, an author of books on technology including ``The 
Cuckoo's Egg'' and ``Silicon Snake Oil,'' recently has spoken out 
against technology in classrooms. ``You want to teach basic learning,'' 
he said from his Oakland, Calif., home. ``The computer doesn't do 
that. They don't encourage love of scholarship. They encourage you 
to browse the Web. Technology doesn't provide education. If you like 
TV, you'll love the Internet. It teaches you how to watch TV.'' Computers 
are pushed on parents much as televisions were in the late 1950s, 
he said. ``I feel that our public schools are being sold down the 
river, a river of technology, a river of easy learning. ``What is 
worthwhile is cooperation, a love of scholarship, art, music, reading 
and writing. That's tough stuff. Shooting down UFOs to learn math 
is dumbing down the curriculum. ``Is a third grader doing research 
worthy of a World Wide Web search? I'm delighted if a fourth-grade 
student does research by reading a book.'' His views will not get 
an argument from all teachers. Ellen Specter, a Cherry Hill, N.J., 
kindergarten teacher, said that in her 32 years of teaching, she has 
seen creativity drop.She attributes part of that to computers. ``They 
expect the visual image to come up before them,'' Specter said. ``Creativity 
has plummeted. Everything is instant. They don't have to play. When 
you ask them to color whatever they want, many will say, `I don't 
know what to color.' That's where you see a difference.''
