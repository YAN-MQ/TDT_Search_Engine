Soon you will see new labels on bottles of Tylenol, Advil and the 
like. The food and drug administration has announced new label requirements 
for over-the-counter pain relievers. Within six months, manufacturers 
must add warnings their product can cause liver damage or stomach 
bleeding for people who have three or more alcoholic drinks a day. 
Doctors say otherwise the products are safe to use as directed.
