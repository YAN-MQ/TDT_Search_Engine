As the owners and the players of the National Basketball Association 
try to negotiate how to divide $2 billion worth of revenue, fans across 
the country are growing disenchanted. They view the labor dispute 
as a battle between rich vs. rich at the expense of people who buy 
high-priced tickets and team merchandise that has made the league 
flourish for the last two decades. In dozens of interviews throughout 
the country, people were certain that the NBA would suffer at the 
box office when the labor dispute is settled. ``When I see Patrick 
Ewing say, `We're fighting for our lives,' I want to throw up,'' said 
Craig Savage, a 50-year-old lawyer from south Florida who owns season 
tickets for Miami Heat games. ``And when I see Alonzo Mourning saying, 
`We're being fair _ there's a luxury tax on making $18 million or 
more a year,' I feel ill. Enough is enough.'' The NBA, which canceled 
the first two weeks of the season and is expected to cancel more games 
within the next week, plans to take steps to appease its fans. One 
is to send season ticket-holders refunds plus 6 percent interest for 
lost games. But it may be too late to avoid a backlash. There are 
signs that fans, either incensed or apathetic, are prepared to stay 
away from the arena, much as they did after the major league baseball 
players strike of 1994-95. ``Both sides are ridiculous,'' said Greg 
Pritz, 28, a financial planner in Chicago who was interviewed on a 
street near Michael Jordan's restaurant. ``They both have enough money, 
and they ought to think about the fans a little more. They're the 
ones who put them there in the first place. I think they ought to 
be worried about a similar backlash that baseball had in 1994, especially 
with how popular baseball is now.'' It took one of the most compelling 
and entertaining seasons in 1998 to thaw the hearts of baseball fans, 
who turned away from the sport in massive numbers, causing a 20 percent 
drop in attendance in 1995. Even the drama generated this year by 
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa's home run race and the Yankees' 114 regular-season 
victories, baseball's attendance figures are still lower than they 
were before the strike. Still, with the resurgence baseball has enjoyed, 
the NBA's owners could not have picked a worse time to lock out their 
players. A disinterested fan may be worse than an angry one, and with 
home runs, pitching duels and pennant races enthralling fans for the 
first time in years, many have not paid much attention to the NBA's 
labor dispute and are not concerned with missing the beginning of 
the season. ``I just don't think too many people care much anymore,'' 
said Merrill Lamb, the 58-year-old president of a pizza chain in south 
Florida. ``I talk to dozens of people a day, and I haven't heard anybody 
say about the NBA: `Oh, they're not playing. I'm going to miss it.' 
They say, `At least I get some money back.''' When the World Series 
ends, the national spotlight will be directed on college and pro football 
and the National Hockey League. ``You have hockey, football, pro and 
college, and you've got baseball deep into October; so where's the 
void?'' Lamb asked. ``When baseball went out Aug. 12, 1994, there 
was no hockey, no football and no basketball going on. I mean, there's 
nothing worse than watching an NFL preseason game. So they had no 
competition.'' Some diehard basketball fans said that if the lockout 
continues into the new year, they would get their hoops fix by watching 
college games. Tito Gomez, 52, who controls more than a dozen Miami 
Heat season tickets for BellSouth, and Thomas Tilson, 48, who has 
shared Heat season tickets with a friend since the team's inception 
in 1988, both said they would begin following the University of Miami 
more closely. And Ron Teel of Lodi, N.J., said it would be April before 
he and his three sons began missing the NBA ``College basketball is 
right around the corner,'' said Teel, while watching his son Kevin, 
12, participate in a basketball camp run by Nets Coach John Calipari. 
``And when March Madness comes around, you'll never miss the pros. 
I wouldn't miss it until after the college season, not until the playoffs.'' 
And some fans could turn to other sports. ``The longer they're out, 
the less it will be missed because, then somebody who wouldn't ordinarily 
watch a hockey game, might watch one,'' said John Fiscina, a 43-year-old 
inventory coordinator from Lodi, N.J. ``I don't watch hockey at all, 
but if it's a Wednesday night and there's nothing else on TV and I'm 
flipping around, maybe I'll stop and watch a hockey game, and maybe 
that will incite some interest in me. Then I'll become a hockey fan 
rather than a basketball fan.'' While major defections among African-Americans, 
who are among the game's staunchest supporters, seem unlikely, they 
do not represent the majority of those who pay an average of $40 a 
ticket to sit and watch games in the NBA's state-of-the-art arenas. 
Kip Chaney, an African-American fan from Paramus, N.J., said the work 
stoppage in basketball could be more detrimental than the one in baseball. 
``Race could be a factor because baseball has a lot of national support,'' 
said Chaney, a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company. 
``It's the national pastime and, generally, baseball has been accepted 
and embraced by everyone nationally. Basketball, for the most part, 
has been a minority-driven sport. Now it's more widespread.'' Chaney 
said that some of the NBA's players are ``young kids who it seems 
haven't had the best morals and do get in some kind of trouble.'' 
He added, ``There are many reasons why those things happen, but I 
do think that the league has had a black mark because of that.'' While 
fans believe that a backlash is inevitable, some said the NBA could 
lessen the blow by salvaging at least a 45- to 50-game season, similar 
to the one the National Hockey League played in its strike-shortened 
season of 1995. ``I think one of the big reasons baseball suffered 
was because they took away the World Series,'' said Mike Epstein, 
35, a co-owner of Gold's Gym in Paramus, where the Nets stars Jayson 
Williams and Keith Van Horn work out. ``Hockey had a shortened season 
as well, and fans didn't really hold it against them as much. Whereas 
in baseball, I think taking away the World Series was a big mistake. 
That set the game back. If basketball loses part of the season, but 
they still have a decent season with playoffs and the world championship, 
I don't think it will be as bad as it could be.''
