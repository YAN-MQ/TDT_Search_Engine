If government bonds don't excite you, the national football league 
has an offer for investors. The NFL will soon be issuing its own 10-year 
bonds, the first such offering by a professional sports league. The 
NFL makes most of its money from TV advertising. Revenue raised from 
the bond sales will be split among the league's 31 member teams.
