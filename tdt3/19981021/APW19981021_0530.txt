Four years after Moldova and Russia agreed that Russian soldiers should 
withdraw from this former Soviet republic, Moldova on Wednesday urged 
Russia to honor the treaty. Only a few soldiers have left the eastern 
breakaway region of Trans-Dniester, where they were sent in 1992 for 
peacekeeping. ``The absence of any essential progress in the withdrawal 
of Russian troops could affect'' relations between the two countries, 
said a statement from the Moldovan Foreign Ministry urging Russia's 
lower house of parliament, the State Duma, to approve the treaty. 
Moldova's government adopted the treaty in November 1994, but Russian 
legislators have not passed it. Moldovan lawmakers say Russia is holding 
out because it wants autonomy for Trans-Dniester. Trans-Dniester, 
a sliver of land in eastern Moldova with a population of 700,000 mainly 
ethnic Slavs, declared independence in 1990 fearing that Moldova, 
dominated by ethnic Romanians, would seek to reunite with neighboring 
Romania. A five-month war between Moldova and the separatists in 1992 
claimed about 700 lives. Fighting ceased after Russia sent in troops, 
led by Alexander Lebed, now governor of a vast Russian region. Relations 
have remained tense. Moldova asked Russian troops to withdraw with 
all their ammunition, fearing weapons, grenades and tanks could fall 
into separatists' hands.
