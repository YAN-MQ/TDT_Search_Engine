Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, employers who screen job applicants 
must do the following: _ An applicant must be told in writing that 
a credit or investigative report will be done. _ An employer needs 
to get an applicant's signature on a document granting permission 
to get background information for legitimate business and employment 
purposes only. _ Before an employer can deny an applicant a job based 
on a background check, the applicant must be given a copy of the report 
and a two-page report called Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act, written by the Federal Trade Commission. _ Applicants 
must be told about their right to ask the prospective employer to 
describe the scope of any background investigation. If the employer 
bases its hiring decision at least in part on information in a consumer 
report, the employer must give the employee the name, address and 
telephone number of the agency that furnished the report. A full description 
of employers' responsibilities under the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
is available on the FTC's Web site (www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcra.htm).
