There was a time not so long ago when the business of dealing with 
customers went to a whole new level of competition and the Mantra 
at that time was service, built-in-service better and the customers 
kill come, and they did. Then it went to a higher level. Then it became 
profit. Here is Jim Avila. Franco Palmer is one of a dying breed. 
He cares about customer service. He sells plumbing supplies at home 
Depot. Experts say it's one of the rare companies that still emphasizes 
service. We believe it's the only way to have profits in this business. 
But that's not the lesson being taught at many business schools today, 
where they teach that customer service may not pay at all and may 
be dying by design. We have been tracking this now for four years. 
And we see a fairly constant decline. Claes fornell created the customer 
satisfaction index at the university of Michigan business school in 
1994. It shows a buying public less satisfied with each passing year. 
Professor fornell says service is sacrificed for short-term profits. 
We have a current that is very dangerous. And that is, profits have 
been coming from cost-cutting for the most part. That's not sustainable 
in the long run. But in the short customer satisfaction is deemed 
a luxury, turning the service counter into a war zone. How bad is 
it? The better business bureau says complaints are up by 12% over 
the last five years and are now at an all-time high -- with the most 
complaints lodged against auto dealers and repair shops, general contractors, 
furniture stores and computer dealers. They don't value customer satisfaction 
very much once they have your money. Randy crenshaw -- billed for 
a computer never delivered. My experience with the company has been 
nonstop frustration. But here's why the experts say companies don't 
seem to care -- customers still come back, seeking price over service. 
Northwestern University business professor Christie norhielm says 
the lesson of the '90s is customer service doesn't matter to the bottom 
line. It's no longer the hot factor. The experts say American businesses 
are providing what we tell them is important, and these days price 
has replaced service at the top of the list. Jim Avila, NBC news,
