Today's Geography Quiz takes us to a country that's been called the 
best of the Americas. That's because it's both the highest and the 
most isolated country in Latin America. Before the Spanish arrived 
here in the early 1500s, this region was home to the Tiajuanaco Indians, 
a group that prospered on the shores of Lake Titicaca. Later, the 
mighty Incas cast their shadow over this country. They were the first 
to tap into its rich silver deposits, a resource that attracted the 
Spanish explorers. Over the centuries, there have been pitched battles 
between the Spanish and this country's native people. Political unrest 
in general has been a theme here. In its 167 years as a republic, 
this country has endured nearly 200 changes of government. One thing 
that has remained constant in our mystery country is the use of corn 
in the diet. It's eaten in all sorts of foods, including pudding. 
We'll give you the details about a savory corn pudding recipe and 
the name of our mystery country in just a few minutes.
