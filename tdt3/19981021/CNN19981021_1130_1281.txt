The Yankees are knocking on the door of 24. I'm Anthony Keith James, 
and this is "Headline Sports." The Yankees are one win away from their 
24th world series title. They can wrap up the fall classic tonight 
with lefty Andy pettitte on the hill against Kevin brown. Tuesday, 
the Bronx bombers, with the help of two homers by Scott brosius, rallied 
to beat the padres, 5-4. Brosius bruising San Diego with four rbi. 
As I kid you dream about, you know, something I've done in my backyard 
100 times. And you never know if you're ever going to get the opportunity 
to do it. And to come out and to do something to help the team win 
feels real good.
