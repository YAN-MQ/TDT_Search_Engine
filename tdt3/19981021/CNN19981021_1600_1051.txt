Day three of the government's antitrust case against Microsoft. Prosecutors 
claim Microsoft launched its allegedly illegal move to conquer the 
Internet browser market more than three years ago when it made an 
offer to take a position in Netscape communications. Microsoft lawyers 
argue Netscape was the first to raise the possibility through a memo 
written by Netscape's co-founder. Well, the significance of the investment 
matter is the government is alleging this Microsoft made that a condition. 
The facts show that it was Netscape that brought that forward. The 
documents show that Netscape was well aware that Microsoft planned 
to put the browser into our operating system. Netscape denies a memo 
was ever written for such a purpose.
