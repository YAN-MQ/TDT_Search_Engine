And police in Boston, Massachusetts say someone has stolen $60,000 
worth of bras from a clothing factory. Some of the bras are imported 
from Europe. Others are rare. The stolen bras come in all shapes, 
sizes and materials - silk, satin, lace and embroidery. According 
to the police, whoever stole the bras knew exactly which ones were 
the most valuable. The less expensive bras were not taken. And I leave 
you with that story and no comment whatsoever.
