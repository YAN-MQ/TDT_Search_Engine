Thanks for coming on. Good to see you both. When we come back, a rare 
conversation with a man who appears on a lot of lists of current wise 
men in Washington, former ambassador and democratic party chairman 
Robert Strauss, his first broadcast interview since the clinfon scandal. 
And who's making sure business has the latest technology? Like the 
Intel Pentium II xeon processor in a custom-built server. Plus a desktop 
and laptop. And who does all that one customer at a time? Gateway. 
So give us a call. It was one of those moments in life you want to 
keep. My husband thought he was getting dinner. My daughter...A new 
friend. Time to cook the lobster! When the moment came, I didn't have 
to worry about the light being low hey! That's my lobster! Or them 
turning out blurry because they were moving. With Kodak Max, I knew 
I'd get my picture. Low light, sunlight, action or still Kodak Max 
is all you need to know about film.
