The Rev. Edward Flannery, a Roman Catholic priest and outspoken opponent 
of anti-Semitism, died on Monday at Miriam Hospital in Providence, 
R.I. He was 86 and lived in a village near Providence. Flannery, a 
veteran Catholic journalist, won acclaim and a National Catholic Book 
Award for his book ``The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-three Centuries 
of Anti-Semitism'' (1965, Paulist Press). In it he wrote: ``This book 
received its first impetus from a personal experience. One evening 
several years ago, I walked in New York City in the company of a young 
Jewish couple,'' within sight of ``the huge illuminated cross the 
Grand Central Building displays at Christmas. The young lady declared: 
`That cross makes me shudder. It is like an evil presence.''' Her 
comment made him think, he recalled. ``It soon became clear that her 
fearful reaction was the fruit of a knowledge which she, but not I, 
had _ a knowledge of the immense suffering undergone by her people 
at the hands of Christians for many centuries.'' So he wrote the book, 
which Monsignor John Oesterreicher of Seton Hall University's Institute 
of Judeo-Christian Studies called ``to the best of my knowledge, the 
first history of anti-Semitism written by a priest.'' In a 1967 interview, 
Flannery said: ``The anti-Semite, not the Jew, is the real Christ-killer. 
He thinks he's religious, but that's a self-delusion. Actually he 
finds religion so heavy a burden, he develops `Christophobia.' He's 
hostile to the faith and has an unconscious hatred of Christ, who 
is for him, Christ the repressor. He uses anti-Semitism as a safety 
valve for this hostility and is really trying to strike out at Christ.'' 
In that year, Flannery began nine years as the National Conference 
of Catholic Bishops' first director of Catholic-Jewish relations. 
Concurrently, he was a professor at Seton Hall's Institute of Judeo-Christian 
Studies for some years. After he died, Cardinal William Keeler, archbishop 
of Baltimore and the Bishops' Conference's episcopal moderator for 
Catholic-Jewish relations, said: ``He was an early and effective pioneer 
in encouraging Catholics in the United States on how best to implement 
Nostra Aetate, the Second Vatican Council's charter for fostering 
positive Catholic-Jewish relationships.'' Rabbi James Rudin, national 
interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee, 
called Flannery ``a major force in the development of constructive 
Catholic-Jewish relations during the past 30 years.'' Flannery also 
served as consultant to the Vatican Secretariat for Catholic-Jewish 
Relations and president of the National Christian Leadership Conference 
for Israel. He was born in Providence to John Flannery, a police officer, 
and the former Elizabeth Mulvey. He studied at St. Charles College 
in Catonsville, St. Sulpice Seminary near Paris, and Catholic University 
in Washington. He was ordained in 1937 and was in the diocese of Providence 
for most of the next three decades, in pastoral and chaplain's posts 
and on the staff of the diocesan newspaper. In 1976 he returned to 
the diocese, which covers all of Rhode Island, and was concerned with 
the continuing education of the diocesan clergy and with Catholic-Jewish 
relations until this year. Surviving are a sister, Catherine Walsh 
of Warwick, R.I.; two nephews, John Flannery of Rochester, N.Y., and 
Richard Walsh of Warwick; and three nieces, Mary Ciunci of Warwick, 
Elizabeth Whistler of Newport, R.I., and Mary Flannery, of Florida.
