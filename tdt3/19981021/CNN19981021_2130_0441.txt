President Clinton has declared disaster areas in 20 Texas counties. 
Storms and accompanying floods have killed 22 people since Saturday. 
Emergency authorities estimate the damage will top $400 million. In 
Victoria and Cuero, the waters are beginning to recede slowly. Curfews 
are enforced in both towns. 500 homes in Victoria have been flooded. 
We're hoping we've seen the highest water that we're going to see 
and also hoping we don't get any more rain today to complicate things. 
But now we're going to have to deal with getting back in to assess 
the property damage and to make sure the areas are safe. The flooding 
has affected blood donations in the area. Volunteers are being asked 
to make up for the shortfall. We'll have the complete national weather 
forecast in just a minute.
