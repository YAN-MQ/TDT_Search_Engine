After six grueling days, quiet progress is being made in the mideast 
peace talks. Negotiations continued late into the night Tuesday and 
were expected to continue Wednesday. CNN has learned Israeli prime 
minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian authority President Yasser 
Arafat have reached a number of agreements. They could sign a comprehensive 
deal as early as Thursday. The talks were boosted by the presence 
of king Hussein of Jordan, who had been resting following cancer treatment. 
President Clinton also took part. Sources tell CNN, under the deal 
now being finalized, the Palestinians would revoke a clause in their 
charter that calls for the destruction of israel. And the Palestinian 
authority would arrest 30 fugitives sought by Israel. Israel would 
withdraw from an additional 13% of the West Bank and would turn over 
another 14% from shared control to Palestinian control. Both sides 
would agree to accept a complex security package. And they would delay 
consideration of a third Israeli troop-withdrawal.
