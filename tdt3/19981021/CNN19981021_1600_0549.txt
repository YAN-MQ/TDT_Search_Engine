Greenpeace protesters are blocking a cargo ship from entering Los 
Angeles harbor. It's part of a protest aimed at saving a British Columbia 
rain forest. Protesters have chained themselves to a Crane on the 
ship. They say it's carrying newsprint made from ancient growth forests 
in the canadian province. The coast guard says no arrests have been 
made, and there have been no reports of violence.
