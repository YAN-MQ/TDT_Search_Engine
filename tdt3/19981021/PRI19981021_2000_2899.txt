Tomorrow, a return to the plantation on the island of Martinique. 
This is THE WORLD on PRI, that's Public Radio International. You're 
listening to THE WORLD on 91 FM, WHYY. Hello, I'm Joe Presudo Pamaco 
taking just one minute now from the program to remind you that we're 
in the middle of 91 FM's October membership drive. There are 91 reasons 
to support 91 FM. What's your reason? Well, regardless of what your 
reason is, we encourage you, cajole you, as a matter of fact, to go 
to your phone and make a pledge to become a member of WHYY. Sixty, 
$120, perhaps at higher levels like $180. And when you think of it 
over the course of an entire year, it's really not that much. The 
phone number to call to make a pledge is 215-923-1234. That's 215-923-1234. 
You can put your pledge on Visa, MasterCard, or American Express. 
You know, a $75 pledge is just six-and-a-quarter a month. It's really 
not that much when you consider all that you get from public radio 
91 FM. 215-923-1234.
