Independent counsel Ken Starr wants a federal appeals court to revive 
tax-evasion charges against President Clinton's friend Webster Hubbell. 
He says a lower court judge was wrong to dismiss the charges. The 
judge ruled Starr overstepped his jurisdiction when he brought the 
charges against Hubbell. Starr originally wanted to know if $700,000 
from President Clinton's supporters was really hush money for Hubbell. 
Starr instead charged Hubbell with failing to pay taxes on some of 
that money.
