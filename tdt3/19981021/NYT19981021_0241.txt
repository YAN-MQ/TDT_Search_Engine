Going through a divorce five years ago, Maralyn Facey watched her 
lawyer set up child custody and visitation schedules with calendar 
sheets, a beleaguered paralegal clutching a calculator, and colored 
pencils spilling across the office floor. A short time later, Ms. 
Facey, 45, the editor of a newsletter for divorced parents, interviewed 
Cosmas Demetriou, a single father and Hollywood set designer who had 
spent $65,000 on a prolonged battle for joint custody of his son and 
daughter. His experience revealed how the innocent-looking colored 
pencils and calendar sheets could become weapons of torture as parents 
fought in court, each side trying to pump up ``quality time percentages'' 
with the kids in order to get more _ or pay less _ child support. 
From that initial meeting sprang a new love _ Demetriou _ and a new 
software program _ Kidmate _ that Ms. Facey developed with Demetriou. 
Kidmate has a site on the Web (www.kidmate.com) and might be described 
as the TurboTax of child custody and visitation battles. Priced at 
$450, it simplifies an unpleasant chore. And it is a tool for the 
times: More than half of married couples part, many of them two-income 
families with both parents seeking to share child care. It is no longer 
the case that divorce automatically relegates the father to a weekend 
role and the mother to an alimony-collecting caregiver. Today, custody 
and visitation come in as many flavors as Coffee. Ms. Facey said development 
costs for Kidmate included $200,000 for programming charges. The software, 
which went on the market in October 1997 chalked up more than $100,000 
in sales its first year. By contrast, Quicken, the popular financial 
software that has been around since the early 1980s, had more than 
$12 million in sales the same period. But KidMate does not have the 
same mass market appeal as Quicken. The buyers of Kidmate are mostly 
matrimonial judges and lawyers in California, New York, Florida, Ohio 
and Canada. It is also expensive _ ``almost as pricey as a lawyer 
_ not quite though,'' said David L. Levy, a lawyer and the president 
of the Children's Rights Council, a national lobbying organization 
in Washington, D.C. Ms. Facey is hoping that Kidmate will spread beyond 
professionals and help families involved in divorce. She plans to 
make available on a Web page (www.kidshare.com) Kidshare, a version 
of the Kidmate software for $10. KidShare will not have as many features 
as KidMate, but Ms. Facey believes it will appeal to those who want 
the convenience of scheduling software that they can e-mail to their 
lawyers and ex-spouses. For Ms. Facey, the software has become a mission. 
``I feel like every single piece came out of my body,'' Ms. Facey 
said. Ms. Facey, who juggles children's soccer matches with cooking 
dinner, runs her fledgling software business out of a converted family 
room in her Los Angeles home. ``I've never been so tired,'' she said, 
``but I've never had this sense of reward. I've had leading judges 
call me up and say, `Awesome.' '' ``Almost every judge I know has 
this program,'' said Alexandra Leichter, who has practiced family 
law in Beverly Hills, Calif., for 26 years and who assisted in reviewing 
earlier versions of the program. ``It has the potential to make our 
lives a lot easier.'' Matrimonial judges in New York State recently 
began using the software package, which Ms. Facey donated to the court 
system. It has already had an impact on how judges do their jobs. 
``It can put into visual terms and language terms the often complex 
kinds of schedules for shared parental time and access to the child,'' 
said Jacqueline Silbermann, New York's administrative judge for matrimonial 
matters. Elizabeth Bryson, co-chairwoman of the New York Women's Bar 
Association's committee on Technology and the Internet for Lawyers, 
says the Kidmate software smooths over snags that regularly pop up 
when one parent suggests a schedule change. A simple request like 
wanting to attend a child's ballet lesson quickly raises hackles. 
``These situations happen routinely,'' Ms. Bryson said, ``and someone's 
assistant in the law office has to sit there with colored pencils 
and try to identify who's getting the child for what week.'' Ms. Facey 
was divorced in 1993. Overnight, she said, her life went from expensive 
grocery stores to coupons at discount stores. She said she felt like 
an alien among her married friends. ``I'm sitting in the car pool 
lane with people saying, `Oh Jim and I are going out to dinner tonight,' 
and so I started talking to my single friends. I said, `There oughtta 
be a newsletter.''' So she began Solo (pages.prodigy.com/Solo/guide.htm), 
which started with 200 copies in 1994 and today circulates to 6,000 
single divorced people. Then came the interview with Demetriou. It 
was Ms. Facey's first attempt at getting the ``men's side of the divorce 
story,'' and, she recalled, she was particularly tough on him. ``He 
took every question and refuted it,'' she said. ``Here was a man who 
put his career second for his kids.'' Ms. Facey was impressed by his 
priorities. She could not help but notice that he was ``cute,'' she 
said, but quickly told herself, ``There's no way.'' But she let him 
start writing articles for Solo, and in time, they decided to combine 
their talents not only for the software project, but for another chance 
at romance. They named their software company Lapin Agile, after the 
Steve Martin play that was Ms. Facey's and Demetriou's first date. 
Both the business and the relationship blossomed, although Ms. Facey 
still puts off marriage. ``I'm too busy giving birth to myself,'' 
Ms. Facey says. KidMate has many features. It immediately calculates 
custody percentages and graphically represents each child's schedule. 
It also solves more mundane problems like projecting the day of the 
week for Yom Kippur in 2001, and dividing up both Christian and Jewish 
holidays. It can be adapted to include other holidays. Programs have 
been created to nail down the financial details of divorce, probate, 
and other species of legal entanglement, but KidMate is the only one 
that focuses on custody and visitation schedules. Programs like Dissomaster, 
frequently used by family courts in California; FinPlan, frequently 
used in New York, and BackCalc, popular in the Washington state courts 
``all do money, Ms. Facey said. ``They don't do children.'' ``Can 
you believe that?'' she said. ``You split the furniture and Aunt Martha's 
silver, but not the kids. Karmically, you have to come back in the 
next life as a bug.'' Ms. Facey's 8-year-old daughter, Claire Elowitt, 
carries a printout of her KidMate schedule in her school notebook. 
It helps Claire to remember if she is spending the weekend at her 
mother's or her father's, an important detail when deciding whether 
she can invite a girlfriend for a sleepover: Mom allows them. Dad 
does not. Ms. Facey believes the software ``empowers kids.'' ``Divorce 
is death,'' she said. ``It's the death of a dream. You think that 
you never have to deal with that person again, but now you're going 
to have to deal with them twice as much. Now everything's an issue 
... and people need to know how to translate this to the kids.'' Although 
members of the legal profession are more computer literate today than 
a decade ago, Ms. Facey still reels when she finds herself introducing 
a top-notch legal mind to a computer mouse. But despite their appeal 
to the computer literate of the legal world, programs like KidMate 
still meet with skepticism from jurists who prefer law libraries and 
yellow notepads. At a recent training session for members of the New 
York Women's Bar Association, only about 15 people showed up, and 
several were concerned that the software would promote certain types 
of custody arrangements over others. KidMate, for the record, offers 
a menu of suggested custody arrangements, but can also be customized. 
``One of the things I noticed was that several matrimonial attorneys 
who came were extremely skeptical because custody arrangements are 
so difficult,'' said Ms. Bryson of the association's computer committee. 
``When they saw it was a calendaring tool, I think it was very interesting 
to watch the transformation that occurred in the room.'' Ms. Bryson, 
who has supported various efforts to use computers to reduce paperwork 
and time pressures in the legal field, said that the resistance to 
KidMate seems similar to the resistance to technology in general. 
In a pilot program to enable electronic case filings in the federal 
courts, Ms. Bryson fielded complaints from law firms who feared increased 
overhead costs and administration. Still, Ms. Bryson says that programs 
such as KidMate have the potential to make lawyers' jobs easier and 
clients' costs lower. ''It's quite different today than it was 15 
years ago. When lawyers were introduced to technology, you had partners 
with computers on their desks as basically overblown paperweights,'' 
Ms. Bryson said. ``But as the utility has increased, it has radically 
changed the way lawyers look at computers and computer programs.'' 
Ms. Facey's concerns are more basic and low-tech. She wants the tool 
out there to help as many divorced families a possible. She plans 
to put up Web page that enables modest-income families to use the 
software for just $10 (www.kidshare.com). As for her not being a ``mission 
person,'' Demetriou begs to differ. ``She is driven. She is dedicated. 
But I think she had to find her mission later in life. The computer 
program is part of that mission,'' he said.
