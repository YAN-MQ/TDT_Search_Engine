Spain has indicated it will support efforts to extradite former Chilean 
leader Augusto Pinochet from Britain if a Spanish judicial panel approves 
the request. Foreign Minister Abel Mutakas told state radio Tuesday 
the government is willing to let justice run its course. Mr. Pinochet 
is currently under armed guard in a London hospital, where he is recovering 
from back surgery. British authorities detained him Friday at the 
request of a Spanish judge, who wants to try him for alleged torture 
and murder of Spanish citizens in Chile during his 17-year rule.
