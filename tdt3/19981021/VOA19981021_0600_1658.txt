Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA NEWS NOW. It is Wednesday, October 
21st, 1998. It was on this date in 1879 the inventor Thomas Edison 
began testing yet another filament for his incandescent electric light 
bulb. The bulb burned brightly for 40 hours becoming the first success 
after thousands of failures at Mr. Edison's Menlo Park, New Jersey 
laboratory. The key to success was his choice of a hair-thin carbon 
filament that would glow but not melt from the heat of the electricity. 
He proclaimed to laboratory workers - If I can make it burn 40 hours, 
I can make it burn 100. I say that every day, Elizabeth. With the 
workable bulb, Mr. Edison began to design the first successful electrical 
lighting systems, and that system eventually provided power to 85 
New York City homes that his company had equipped with electric circuits 
and light bulbs. He did keep wood things, didn't he? He did. On October 
21st, 1959, New York City politicians and luminaries from the city's 
art world celebrated the opening of the Guggenheim Museum of Art. 
The white cylindrical structure immediately became the most controversial 
museum building in the United States because it's design by Frank 
Lloyd Wright was such a radical departure from traditional museum 
architecture. The Wright design had visitors walk a continuous spiral 
ramp around the curved walls inside to view the artworks on display. 
The museum was architect Wright's last major assigning and his only 
work in New York City. The Guggenheim remains one of America's foremost 
museums of contemporary art. It's universal time. This is VOA NEWS 
NOW. Israeli and Palestinians are reported near an agreement on a 
critical security issue. P Turkey says Syria promises to stop supporting 
rebel Turkish Kurds. And there is freedom of speech in the military 
- well, not really. Details coming up in this half hour of VOA NEWS 
NOW. Hello, again, from Washington. I'm Elizabeth A ett along with 
Steve Norman.
