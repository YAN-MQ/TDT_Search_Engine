Mike Sammond, "Headline Sports." The New York Yankees are one win 
away from claiming their 24th world series title. Game three Tuesday 
night -- Scott brosius cracked a three-run homer in the eighth inning 
to lift the Yankees past the padres 5-4. New York can complete the 
four-game sweep Wednesday night in San Diego. When these guys come 
to the field, the only thing they're interested in is winning the 
game. They don't care who gets the winning hit. They all wanna get 
the game-winning hit, but they don't talk about it. It's a -- it's 
a very unusual club. It's tough. I mean this game -- it will reach 
in and grab your guts out. And when you lose games like this it -- 
sure it's tough to take. But it's the hard part of this game, you 
know? Winning is great, but losing, especially in the word series, 
is tough.
