With less than two weeks until the election, Gov. George Pataki and 
his Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, both kept their campaigning 
low-key Wednesday. Pataki's sole campaign event was an appearance 
on the ``Rambling With Gambling'' morning radio show on WOR-AM in 
Manhattan, where he touted the achievements of his first four years 
in office, but said he needed four more years. ``Everything still 
needs fixing here,'' Pataki said, adding that the day you're satisfied 
``is the day you should hand the job over to someone else.'' He also 
expressed his support for keeping the Yankees in the Bronx, saying 
that the state could pay for a Metro-North station at Yankee Stadium 
as well as highway improvements. But he said he had not had ``head-to-head 
discussions'' with George M. Steinbrenner III, the team's principal 
owner, in at least a year. Vallone had a slightly busier day, consisting 
of two stops at senior centers in Yonkers and an evening speech to 
a Brooklyn Democratic club. He spent the morning making fund-raising 
calls, and the afternoon in meetings with newspaper editorial boards. 
At the Coyne Park Senior Citizens Center in Yonkers, Vallone greeted 
a few tables of elderly, but energetic, poker players, and then spoke 
briefly to the group of 40. He called for more nutrition centers _ 
senior centers that provide lunch _ in the state, and reiterated his 
call for a state-run health care plan, which he said would greatly 
reduce if not eliminate the role of for-profit insurance companies 
in favor of universal coverage by the state. That issue seemed to 
resonate with the elderly at the center, who disparaged health maintenance 
organizations. ``I like the idea of his medical plan, that they're 
not going to take away benefits,'' said Adeline Balzo, 72, of Yonkers. 
Vallone conceded on Wednesday that a gubernatorial debate with Pataki 
seemed increasingly unlikely. Vallone has repeatedly said that he 
will debate the governor under any conditions; Pataki, in turn, has 
said that the campaigns are negotiating about debates. Vallone scoffed 
at that assertion. ``He says negotiation is going on,'' Vallone said. 
``I think it's negotiation between himself and his own staff. There's 
nothing to negotiate. Just pick the time and place and we'll be there.'' 
Meanwhile, B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate for 
governor, held a news conference on Wednesday outside Buffalo Bills 
Stadium, where he attacked the state's financial package for the stadium, 
saying it would not guarantee the Bills' presence in Buffalo beyond 
a year.
