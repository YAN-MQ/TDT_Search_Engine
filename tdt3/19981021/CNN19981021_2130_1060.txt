Several airlines are offering bargain fares to lure business travelers. 
Stephanie Oswald looks at what's out there and where you can find 
it in this "working ahead." With many of the world's economies in 
turmoil, it should come as no surprise more and more business travelers 
are accepting new cost-saving services. A recent survey by the international 
air transport association shows use of the Internet for flight information 
has increased 20% in the last year. And while many still shy away 
from actually booking reservations online, 38% of those surveyed believe 
competitive fares can be found on the internet. The survey also found 
some business travelers giving discount airlines more consideration, 
especially employees from smaller companies who are not frequent fliers. 
70% of north American business travelers surveyed said they are willing 
to go the low-fare route. There are some airfare deals to take note 
of this week. TWA has announced discounted fares of up to 50% on many 
U.S. flights. Travelers need to purchase tickets by October 23rd and 
must fly by February 10th. And southwest airlines has brought back 
its popular "friends fly free" campaign. Travelers receive a free 
companion fare when purchasing a full fare ticket. To take advantage 
of the deal, buy by December 10th, and fly by April 3rd. Stephanie 
Oswald, CNN, reporting.
