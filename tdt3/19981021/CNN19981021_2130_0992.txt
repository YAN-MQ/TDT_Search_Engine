In Miami, federal investigators say they've broken up a major Medicare 
fraud ring. Federal indictments were unsealed today against 39 doctors, 
nurses and others connected to the home health care company amitan. 
Investigators say the company created false medical records for patients 
and submitted $10 million worth of phony Medicare bills for their 
treatment. Amitan was shut down last year.
