Congolese President Laurent Kabila failed to attend talks Wednesday 
with his southern African military allies over the civil war in his 
vast mineral-rich country. Kabila was feeling unwell and sent an aide 
instead, said Zimbabwean government spokesman George Charamba. Congo 
was expected to ask its allies to deploy more troops in the eastern 
jungles, where rebels have made rapid advances. Attending the talks 
hosted by President Robert Mugabe were President Sam Nujoma of Namibia, 
Angola's President Eduardo dos Santos and Kabila aide Victor Mpoyo, 
officials said. No other details were given, but the state controlled 
Herald newspaper said the leaders will ``review their military position 
in the wake of rebel advances'' in the eastern Congo. Zimbabwe on 
Tuesday acknowledged that 16 of its soldiers were captured by Congolese 
rebels in the eastern town of Kabalo. Their capture followed the fall 
11 days ago to rebels of Kindu, a strategically important town 380 
kilometers (235 miles) southwest of Goma, the rebels' eastern headquarters. 
Mugabe told state television late Tuesday the Zimbabwean troops taken 
prisoner were on a reconnaissance mission in the east. ``When you 
get into a war, you expect death and losses. But we are fighting with 
determination that in spite of the setbacks, we will achieve victory,'' 
he said. It was the first admission that soldiers from the allied 
forces from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe had deployed in the east 
and was a signal Mugabe is determined to commit troops there. Rebels, 
backed by Rwanda and Uganda, have been making steady gains in eastern 
Congo since they took up arms Aug. 2. The allied intervention force 
helped fend off a rebel onslaught on the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, 
in August. Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing 
them of being backed by Rwanda and Uganda. ``Ugandan and Rwandese 
troops have not withdrawn as demanded by the allies but continue to 
escalate fighting in the eastern part of the country despite international 
calls for a cease fire,'' the Zimbabwe foreign ministry said in a 
statement on Wednesday's summit. It said a peace initiative launched 
by the continent-wide Organization of African Unity will resume with 
a meeting in the Zambian capital of Lusaka on Saturday of defense 
and foreign ministers of Congo-backing countries joined by officials 
from Gabon, Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa. In South Africa, 
President Nelson Mandela has begun a series of separate meetings to 
revive efforts to broker a peaceful end to the Congo conflict. Mandela 
met Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Monday and planned talks 
with the Rwandan military strongman and vice president, Gen. Paul 
Kagame, on Thursday and with the rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition 
in the coming days.
