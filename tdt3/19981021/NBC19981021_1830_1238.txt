A gymnast who charmed the world in the 1996 Olympics is suing her 
parents, charging them with wasting all her money and wrecking her 
childhood with relentless pressure. Dominique Moceanu was the youngest 
member of the U.S. Olympic team at the atlanta games. She's now 17 
and wants to be declared an adult so she can live apart from her parents 
and control her own money. A court day is set for November 11th.
