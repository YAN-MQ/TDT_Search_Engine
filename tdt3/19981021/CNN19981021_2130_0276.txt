After months of bipartisan haggling, the budget battle is over. President 
Clinton signed a $520 billion spending package today. He says the 
4,000-page Bill "strengthens our country and looks to the future." 
The Senate adjourned after approving the measure this morning. First, 
they enacted a provision that could call them back to Washington on 
as little as two days' notice. That's in case they need to vote on 
articles of impeachment against President Clinton. The house did the 
same thing.
