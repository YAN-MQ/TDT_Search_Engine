Texas governor George W. bush is asking President Clinton to declare 
disaster areas in 20 counties. Torrential rains and flooding in the 
state have killed at least 20 people. Tony Clark has more from Victoria, 
one of the hardest-hit areas. The guadalupe river, normally 150-feet 
wide, stretched three to four miles across as it swept through south 
Texas. The fast-moving river flooded hundreds of homes and swept away 
others. There's still more -- more flooding that's gonna occur and 
more people that probably gonna have to leave their home and go to 
a Shelter. So it's not over yet. And we don't know, for sure, how 
high the peak of the river's gonna get. Boats were used to rescue 
some residents. And when the river started moving too fast for boats 
-- helicopters were brought in to pluck residents from their roofs. 
I've been here for 40 years. I've never seen anything -- anything 
like this. I've talked to people that are 80 years old and nobody's 
ever seen anything like this. You're looking probably approximately 
eight to ten feet in this area right around here. Some workers were 
reported stranded at this power plant, highways were impassable. Even 
cows have had to scramble for safety. It has rained 15 to 20 inches 
in south Texas since last Friday, flooding a Wide area and forcing 
residents like viola Garcia out of their homes. I had moved to a different 
house and I just fixed my house. I just remodeled my house from the 
insides and I just moved in. I'm not even -- some of my boxes aren't 
even unpacked and here I'm moving back again, you know? So, it's -- 
it's hard. The guadalupe river is expected to crest in Victoria, Texas, 
some time overnight, flooding one-fourth of the city. Tony Clark, 
CNN, Victoria, Texas. We'll have the full extended forecast at 38 
minutes past the hour.
