Cashing in on strong passenger traffic, low fuel prices, and a strike 
at Northwest Airlines, three of the country's largest airlines reported 
record third-quarter earnings Wednesday, while a fourth _ Trans World 
Airlines _ posted a surprising loss. The mostly strong results seemed 
to ignore recent investor worries that a weakening economy would result 
in a decline in air travel. But executives at several of the carriers 
also expressed concerns about the future and said they were considering 
scaling back their planned growth next year, when the number of new 
airline seats is expected to rise faster than economic growth for 
the first time since the early 1990s. ``Nobody is singing the blues 
at the domestic carriers,'' said Kevin Murphy, who follows the airline 
industry at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York, ``but everybody 
is cautious.'' Earnings at American Airlines and US Airways, the second- 
and sixth-largest carriers in the country, easily surpassed the expectations 
of Wall Street, while earnings at United Airlines, the nation's largest, 
were slightly weaker than expected because of its large exposure in 
Asia. The three carriers' figures were in line with strong results 
reported in the last week by Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines. 
Indeed, of the country's major airlines, the only disappointments 
have been at Northwest, which suffered a worse-than-expected loss 
from the pilots' strike last month, and TWA, which has been struggling 
to regain its equilibrium. Most airline stocks declined Wednesday. 
United's parent company, UAL, was down $3.4375 to $62.9375; AMR, parent 
of American, closed at $57.875, down 6.25 cents; US Airways fell $1 
to $54.8125; and TWA was down 87.5 cents, closing at $4.5625. AMR 
said its net income grew 34 percent in the quarter to $433 million, 
or $2.49 a diluted share, compared with $323 million, or $1.78 a share, 
in the similar period last year. Wall Street had expected $2.32 a 
share. The company's revenue grew 7.2 percent, to $5 billion, compared 
with $4.7 billion in 1997. Gerard Arpey, AMR's chief financial officer, 
said the quarter was the best in the company's history, and the sixth 
consecutive record. He added that the Northwest strike and another 
at Air Canada increased AMR revenue by $50 million in the quarter, 
$16 million of which was offset by the cancellation of about 1,000 
American flights as the result of Hurricane Georges. From July to 
September, AMR bought back $500 million worth of its stock, and the 
company's board recently authorized another $500 million buyback. 
US Airways reported net income for the quarter of $142 million, or 
$1.51 a diluted share, compared with $187 million, or $1.82 a share 
last year. But on an operating basis, its earnings grew 20 percent 
to $140 million, or $1.49 a share, from $117 million, or $1.14 a share. 
Analysts polled by First Call had estimated $1.43 a share. Revenue 
rose 4.4 percent to $2.2 billion from $2.12 billion last year as the 
carrier said its planes were filled to record levels in each of the 
quarter's three months. UAL said earnings rose 3.4 percent to $516 
million, or $3.71 a diluted share, compared with $499 million, or 
$3.75 a share in the period last year. Revenue rose 3 percent, to 
$4.78 billion, from $4.64 billion. Analysts had expected $4.07 a share. 
United said it gained $75 million in revenue from the strike at Northwest, 
more than any other airline. But the gains were largely offset by 
weak sales in the Asia-Pacific region, which provides nearly 20 percent 
of its total revenue. The carrier was particularly hard hit by a rise 
in the value of the Japanese yen during the quarter. ``We are no longer 
certain of profitability for the Pacific for the full year,'' James 
Goodwin, UAL's president and chief operating officer, told reporters. 
But he hastened to add that barring any major changes in the industry 
or the economy, United was on track to surpass last year's record 
earnings. Despite reports that companies are cutting travel budgets, 
American, United and US Airways said that advance bookings are strong. 
After many years of growing more slowly than the industry as a whole, 
American is planning to take delivery of 49 new Boeing jets next year, 
increasing its total number of seats by 6 percent. But Arpey said 
the company was studying whether to reduce that growth rate by one-third 
by retiring some of its older DC-10 and 727 jets earlier than planned. 
Executives at United and US Airways also said they were considering 
lowering their growth next year. TWA has more serious problems. The 
airline, the country's eighth largest, had an operating loss in the 
quarter of $923,000, or 11 cents a share, compared with a profit of 
$13.3 million, or 17 cents, last year. The average estimate of analysts 
surveyed by First Call was 33 cents a share. Revenue fell 5 percent, 
to $863.2 million, from $908.4 million as TWA's efforts to attract 
lucrative business passengers failed to make up for an overall passenger 
decline. The airline announced a fare sale on Tuesday to win back 
budget-minded leisure passengers, and Wednesday it announced the purchase 
of five Boeing jets. But the poor quarter was a bad omen. ``If TWA 
can't make profit in a quarter when traffic is strong, fuel is cheap 
and they got 14 cents a share from the strike at Northwest,'' said 
Brian Harris, the airline analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, ``we 
wonder when they can make a profit.''
