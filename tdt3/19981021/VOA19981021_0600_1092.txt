The New York Yankees have come from behind to defeat the San Diego 
Padres 5-4 for a victory in game three of baseball's World Series. 
The win Tuesday in San Diego gives New York a commanding three-games-to-none 
lead in the best-of-seven championship series. The Padres took an 
early 3-0 lead in the sixth inning on a base hit, a sacrifice fly, 
and on a rare fielding error by New York's Paul O'Neill. New York's 
Scott Brocius began the comeback in the sixth inning with a solo home 
run and then slammed a three-run shot over the fence in the eighth 
inning. Brocius says he is very happy to have moved from the Oakland 
Athletics to the Yankees and experience success in the World Series. 
There's nothing more fun than this. Coming over here was just like 
a shot of adrenaline for me - to come over and know that we had a 
chance to win over here. And like I said, this is what you play for. 
When you grow up, you want to go -- you know - have a chance to get 
in the World Series and play. So this whole year has just been great 
for me. The Yankees are now one win away from taking the 25th World 
Series title in franchise history. San Diego hosts game number four 
later today.
