A senior United Nations official visited the wife of Malaysia's jailed 
dissident leader Wednesday and described her as ``a courageous lady.'' 
Abib Hussain, the special rapporteur on freedom of expression and 
opinion of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, did not say, however, 
whether he had come to Malaysia specifically to meet Azizah Ismail. 
Azizah, the wife of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, said 
earlier she hoped she would not be arrested on charges of encouraging 
protests against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Her comments came 
after rumors of her arrest swept across Kuala Lumpur. Reporters and 
photographers rushed to her home. ``I'm very encouraged that he came 
to visit me,'' Azizah said of Hussain, who was India's ambassador 
to the United Nations in the early 1990s. Fears of her arrest were 
fueled by comments by Mahathir Tuesday just before he concluded a 
five-day visit to Tokyo. ``I hope the police won't arrest (her), but 
I don't know. That is the police business,'' Mahathir reportedly said. 
Soon after Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest following a mammoth public rally 
demanding Mahathir's resignation, police warned Azizah she would face 
the same fate if she led the campaign her husband started. She drove 
up to a street protest for the first time Saturday, waving at the 
slogan-shouting demonstrators and shaking hands with many of them. 
Azizah said Wednesday the prime minister seemed to be directing his 
wrath toward her. ``I implore Dr. Mahathir to be more responsible 
and not be so arrogant,'' she said, denying that she had joined the 
protest. She had driven to the demonstration out of curiosity, she 
said. Meanwhile, Mahathir said Wednesday he won't be pressured into 
calling early elections although demonstrations against his 17-year 
leadership have become commonplace, even in rural areas. ``I do not 
see why I should be pushed into an earlier election because that will 
have the effect of undermining our economic programs,'' the national 
news agency Bernama quoted him as saying. General elections do not 
have to be held before April 2000. Mahathir said he was ready to weather 
the barrage of demonstrations aimed at toppling his administration. 
Thousands of supporters of Anwar continue to take to the streets every 
week despite stern police warnings and hundreds of arrests. The campaign 
against Mahathir began after he fired Anwar on Sept. 2. The two had 
differed over economic policy, but Mahathir said he had acted because 
Anwar was morally unfit to lead. Anwar since has been charged with 
sexual misconduct and corruption _ charges he says are false and politically 
motivated. On Wednesday, the government warned the editor of an opposition 
newspaper, which has increased its circulation since the pro-Anwar 
campaign began, not to sell at newsstands. The editor of the publication 
run by the Parti Islam SeMalaysia, or PAS, was summoned to the Home 
Ministry to explain why the party newsletter was being sold publicly 
as a daily newspaper, an official said. He did not say when the editor 
was called in. The Harakah daily and other fringe publications by 
opposition activists on the Internet have become increasingly popular 
among Malaysians jaded by pro-government coverage in the nation's 
major newspapers.
