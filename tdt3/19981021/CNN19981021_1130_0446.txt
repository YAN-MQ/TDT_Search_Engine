John Glenn reportedly has been dropped from one of the experiments 
on aging to be conducted on the next shuttle mission. Today's "New 
York Times" says, the 77-year-old astronaut was quietly removed from 
the experiment in August because he didn't meet one of the medical 
requirements. It would have tested the effects of the natural hormone, 
melatonin, on people in orbit. Neither Glenn nor the lead researcher 
on the project would comment further. Glenn remains on the list to 
participate in studies on sleep and the use of protein. To follow 
John Glenn's return to space, scheduled for next Thursday, plug into
