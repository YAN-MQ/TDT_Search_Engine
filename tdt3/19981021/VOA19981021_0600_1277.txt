The manager for World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis 
of Britain says a contract for a title unification bout with Evander 
Holyfield should be signed this week. Lewis was supposed to sign the 
contract Monday. However, his manager, Frank Maloney says legal problems 
and technicalities have delayed Lewis's signing of the contract. Holyfield, 
the World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation champion, 
signed the contract last week. Holyfield will earn about $20 million 
while Lewis is slated to received $8 million. Maloney also said former 
champion Mike Tyson's return to the ring is good for boxing. Tyson's 
boxing license was reinstated Monday by the Nevada State Athletic 
Commission. And the International Boxing Federation has ordered four 
of its top-ranked heavyweight boxers to fight each other to determine 
which will become the number one contender to champion Evander Holyfield. 
American Vaugh Bean was the number one IBF contender until he lost 
to Holyfield on September the 19th in Atlanta. That's sports. I'm 
Jim Stevenson.
