A new round of Korean peace talks has gotten off to a shaky start 
in Geneva with North Korea renewing its long-standing demand that 
U.S. troops leave South Korea. That same demand led to the collapse 
of the last round of talks in March. Diplomats say there is no indication 
this new round will be any different. Pyongyang is also asking for 
a separate peace with the United States, but Washington says any settlement 
must involve Seoul.
