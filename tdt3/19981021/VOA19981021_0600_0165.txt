NATO's top military commander has met with Yugo President Slobodan 
Milosevic to press for compliance with international demands to end 
the conflict in Kosovo. General Wesley Clark met with Mr. Milosevic 
late Tuesday in Belgrade. U.S. officials said he planned to warn the 
Yugoslav leader that NATO is prepared to use military force if he 
does not withdraw Serbian forces sent to crack down on ethnic Albanian 
separatists. NATO has set a deadline of October 27th.
