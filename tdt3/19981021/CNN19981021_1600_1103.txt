In a different sort of legal battle, a woman in California is suing 
the estate of her deceased live-in boyfriend. She claims his decision 
to leave most of his $5 million estate to his dog was unfair. She 
wants half the money. All she got was an annual stipend of $60,000 
to care for the pooch, and she loses that when the dog dies. A judge 
has ordered the case to mediation.
