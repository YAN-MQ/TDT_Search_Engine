Athletic de Bilbao dominated play but failed to garner more than a 
0-0 draw against Juventus in European Champions League play here Wednesday. 
Before some 40,000 fans packing the San Mames stadium, Bilbao's Spanish 
international Joseba Etxeberria had two fine chances at goal in the 
first half saved by Juventus' goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi. In the first 
45 minutes, Juventus' closest attempts on goal came with two shots 
from striker Filippo Inzaghi but neither caused Bilbao 'keeper Imanol 
Etxeberria any real problems. In the second half Juventus, who lost 
the Champions Cup final last season to Spanish side Real Madrid, sought 
to change the scoreline when French international Didier Deschamps 
let fly a shot from the edge of the area in the 59th minute. Less 
than 10 minutes later Inzaghi received a pass in the box from France's 
Zinedine Zidane but failed to put it past 'keeper Imanol. Prior to 
the start of the second half, the game looked as if it were about 
to be marked by violence when police cleared dozens of Juventus fans 
from the stadium after several of them began throwing objects at other 
spectators in nearby sections. The Italian fans were allowed return 
moments later and there were no further reports of trouble.
