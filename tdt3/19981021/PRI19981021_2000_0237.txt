I'm Lisa Mullins. Whether it's the ruble, the yen, the franc, or the 
pound, when currency values fluctuate, people get nervous. Financial 
jitters also make it difficult to plan a big purchase. Is this the 
best time to buy a car? Will my money be worth more if I wait a while? 
Well, right now, this station is asking you to put your money into 
public radio. Is it a good investment? Is this the best time to make 
a pledge? Unlike currency exchange rates or the cost of imports, the 
value of public radio is a constant. You depend on this station as 
a source of information and it performs for you reliably. And even 
though the cost of making radio can go up and down, we are not asking 
you to float your member share or index your pledge to inflation. 
We just want you to consider what this station is worth to you. And 
call now to show your support. Here's the number to call to make a 
pledge to 91 FM: 215-923-1234. That's 215-923-1234. Stick around. 
We've got THE WORLD coming up in just a moment. Hello, I'm Joe Persudo 
Pamaco remind you that we're in the middle of our October membership 
drive at 91 FM, and we want to have your membership pledge now on 
the line at 215-923-1234. You make the programs possible on this noncommercial 
public radio station. Pledge now. 215-923-1234. Thanks very much for 
your support.
