The center for science in the public interest says parents should 
watch what their children drink. The group found the average 13-year-old 
to 18-year-old boy drinks more than three 12-ounce cans of soda each 
day. Girls in that age group drink go for two cans of soda. That makes 
up about 18% of their daily calories. The soft drink industry brings 
in $54 billion a year, and consumption is up 43% since 1985. And the 
group says all that soda could take its toll. We should be eating 
as healthy a diet as possible. That can reduce the risk of cancer, 
heart disease, a whole range of other health problems. We're not putting 
a six pack of Coke in the same category as a six pack of beer or a 
pack of cigarettes. It ain't that bad. It is a soft drink. But just 
because it's not as bad as liquor doesn't mean that it's innocuous. 
When Americans are eating this volume of soda pop, it's gotta have 
health consequences. The group says girls in particular are at risk 
of osteoporosis because they are not getting enough calcium. The soft 
drink industry says the study is stirring up unfounded consumer alarm.
