Ronaldo scored what turned out to be the winning goal in his return 
from injury Wednesday, lifting Internazionale of Milan past Spartak 
Moscow 2-1 in a Champions League Group C game. The Brazilian star, 
out a month with tendinitis in both knees, gathered the ball after 
it was fumbled by 'keeper Alexander Filimonov and slotted home to 
give Inter a 2-0 lead in the 59th minute before 44,199 at San Siro 
Stadium. Spartak, the only club in the competition to win both of 
its first two group games, pulled a goal back in the 65th, when midfielder 
Ilya Tsymbalar headed in Andrei Tikhonov's left flank cross. Tsymbalar 
has scored in each Champions League game this season. Ronaldo also 
had a role in the opening goal, in the 32nd, faking a shot on a free 
kick and rolling a nifty pass over to Nicola Ventola, whose 25-meter 
(yard) blast skimmed off the right post and into the net. The two-time 
FIFA player of the year had not played since Sept. 20 and had suggested 
he might only see 45 minutes of action Wednesday. He played 72, leaving 
in favor of countryman Ze Elias, a defensive-minded midfielder. The 
Russians forced Inter 'keeper Gianluca Pagliuca to make two leaping 
saves on long-range shots in the first 12 minutes, first from Tikhonov 
and then Vasily Baranov. Filimonov was also kept busy, making back-to-back 
saves with his legs on Andre Pirlo and French winger Benoit Cauet 
in the 40th minute. The 'keeper also stopped Ronaldo on a one-on-one 
chance five minutes later. Pirlo had come off the bench to replace 
Youri Djorkaeff in the 35th, when the member of France's World Cup 
champions limped off the field with a right thigh strain. Both Inter, 
which rebounded from its 5-3 loss Sunday to Lazio of Rome in Italian 
League action, and Spartak have two wins and a loss after three rotations.
