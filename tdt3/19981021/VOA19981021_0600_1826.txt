Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are said to be close to agreement 
on a critical security issue at the Mideast summit talks outside Washington. 
Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Israel would no longer 
insist that suspected Palestinian terrorists into Israel. The sources 
told news agencies the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency would supervise 
the jailing of suspected Palestinian terrorists by the Palestinian 
Authority. In exchange, they say the Palestinians have pledged to 
arrest and jail militants whom Israel can prove were involved in deadly 
attacks on Israelis. However, a White House spokesman said there are 
still large gaps between the two sides. This is the seventh day of 
talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat.
