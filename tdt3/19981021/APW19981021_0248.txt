Germany's designated finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, will meet 
on Thursday with his French counterpart, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a 
Lafontaine aide said Wednesday. No agenda was detailed for the meeting, 
to be held in the western German city of Saarbruecken, Lafontaine's 
political base. But the men were expected to discuss forging a European 
position on ways to ward off global financial crises. Strauss-Kahn 
and Lafontaine have floated similar ideas for a system to ensure stable 
exchange rates between the world's major currencies.
