Swedish automaker Volvo reported Wednesday that its nine-month pre-tax 
profit dropped 27 percent from the same period a year earlier, largely 
due to significantly weaker demand in Southeast Asia. The company 
recorded pre-tax proft for the period ending Sept. 30 of 7.79 billion 
kronor (dlrs 993 million), compared with 10.72 billion kronor for 
the first nine months in 1997. Sales in Asia fell by 27 percent, to 
8.64 billion kronor (dlrs 1.1 billion) while sales in other areas 
grew, up 31 percent in North America to 46.87 billion (dlrs 5.97 billion) 
and up 14 percent in Western Europe to 82.44 billion kronor (dlrs 
10.5 billion). But the company said its profits were affected not 
only by the decline in Asian sales but also by a shift in demand to 
products with lower profit margins. In addition, Volvo has endured 
higher costs for product development, start-up of production and the 
launch of new products. Volvo has matched the growth strategy that 
was presented in 1997, but the global scenario that formed the basis 
for that strategy didn't include the current turbulence in financial 
markets and the deep crisis in certain geographical markets, Volvo's 
Chief Executive Leif Johansson said in a written comment. ``If the 
turbulence and crises continue and result in a declining total market, 
measures will have to be taken to adapt the Group's level of costs 
to smaller volumes,'' Johansson said.
