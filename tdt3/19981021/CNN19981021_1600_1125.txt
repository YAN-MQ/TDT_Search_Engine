Back on Wall Street -- the Dow gains 13 points, the NASDAQ 35. That's 
"Dollars & Sense." Back to you, Denise. Next, in "Headline Sports" 
-- the New York Yankees look to do something they've done 23 times 
before. Of all the things we might put honey in, the best may be new 
honey cough. Introducing the first line of cough drops and cough syrup 
combining effective medicine with real honey. To relieve even the 
worst coughs. New honey cough: mmmm! If you looked into your local 
carrier's phone lines what time period would they place your company 
in? Why live in the past... when local's future is right through here? 
On-net. Where local, national and global all flow over one network, 
owned by one company. Oh, and did I mention... it'll save you money? 
On-net. From MCI WorldCom.
