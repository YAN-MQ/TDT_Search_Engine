The third round of four-party Korean peace talks have begun in Geneva. 
Negotiators from North Korea, South Korea, the United States and China 
gathered to resume discussions aimed at forging a permanent Korean 
peace treaty. However, the two previous rounds ended without apparent 
success. The last round broke down over North Korean demands for the 
withdrawal of U.S. troops in South Korea.
