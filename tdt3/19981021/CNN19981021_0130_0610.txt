Lawyers are preparing for day three of the Microsoft antitrust trial 
in washington. For a recap of day two here's Johnathan Karl. A day 
after the justice department depicted Bill Gates as an unscrupulous 
and dishonest monopolist, Microsoft hit back. We will show that the 
government's case is a groundless exercise designed to benefit just 
a handful of Microsoft's competitors who do not compete with us on 
the merits of their technology. In it's opening statement, Microsoft 
lawyer John Warden accused the government of trying to demonize Bill 
Gates. "The government's case is long on rhetoric and short on substance," 
he told the court. Microsoft has very good counsel. But they can't 
change the law. They can't change the facts. And they really can't 
change the subject. The subject matter is what Microsoft did that 
was anti-competitive. The justice department accuses Microsoft of 
illegally using its monopoly power to try to destroy other companies, 
such as Internet browser manufacturer Netscape. Warden said Microsoft's 
actions are not illegal, just smart business tactics. Warden called 
Netscape a "Ward of the state" unable to compete because its technology 
is inferior. He faced off against Netscape CEO Jim barksdale, the 
government's lead witness. The evidence this afternoon demonstrated 
that Netscape has had a consistent policy of attempting to use the 
government as part of it's overall competitive process against Microsoft 
for over three years. Microsoft's cross-examination of barksdale continues 
Wednesday. In an effort to speed up the trial, the judge has ordered 
that all witnesses submit their direct testimony in writing. And the 
justice department says that it wants a speedy trial because every 
day of delay is another day for Microsoft to solidify its market dominance.
