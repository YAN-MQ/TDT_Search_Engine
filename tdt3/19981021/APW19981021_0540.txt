Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday raised the minimum wage from 55 
hryvna (dlrs 16) a month to 148 hryvna (dlrs 43) a month. Although 
nearly all Ukrainians earn more than the minimum wage, the figure 
is used as a base to calculate various payments throughout the country. 
The increase, approved by a vote of 243-12, will cost the government 
an additional 8 million hryvna (dlrs 2.33 million) by the end of 1998, 
Labor Minister Ivan Sakhan told parliament. Ukraine's leftist-dominated 
legislature long has favored extra spending for social needs. The 
country has also been hit by residual effects of Russia's economic 
crisis. Last year, the parliament approved a law under which the minimum 
wage is to be raised every three months to correspond to the official 
poverty level, which was set by lawmakers Wednesday at 118.6 hryvna 
(dlrs 34.6) a month. The minimum wage was last raised in July. The 
average monthly wage in Ukraine was about 170 hryvna (dlrs 49.6 at 
the current rate) in the first half of 1998.
