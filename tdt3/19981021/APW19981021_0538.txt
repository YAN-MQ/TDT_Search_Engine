Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov blamed Russian economic policies for the 
country's financial collapse, but promised potential investors Wednesday 
that the new government would not turn back free-market reforms. Speaking 
on the opening day of the Moscow International Business Association 
conference, Luzhkov said investors should not fear the new Russian 
Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov _ even though it 
includes Communist Party members. ``Many people actively functioning 
today have in the past been over there _ all of us have,'' he said. 
``We have to be fair. ... I am not concerned that this government 
will return our economy back.'' The conference is seeking to interest 
foreign businesses in more than 200 investment opportunities in the 
Russian capital. The popular Moscow leader, who plans to run for president 
in 2000, tried to reassure his audience that Moscow remains a safe 
and stable market. In August, the Russian economy collapsed when President 
Boris Yeltsin's government allowed the ruble to fall against Western 
currencies and declared a moratorium on payments of loans. Calling 
the collapse ``inevitable,'' Luzhkov blamed the ``erroneous policy 
of the Russian federal government'' for the problems. He said the 
country rushed to transform its economy, which led to privatized businesses 
that did not improve efficiency and added nothing to the country's 
coffers. Luzhkov also said the ``radical reformers'' who demanded 
zero inflation encouraged an economy based on bartering rather than 
the exchange of cash. And he criticized the West and the International 
Monetary Fund for giving Russia aid and loans without monitoring how 
it was being spent. ``The aid did not go to industry,'' he said. ``Some 
was eaten up, some was lost. This is a soft way of saying what you 
all know I am thinking.'' It was that foreign aid, Luzhkov contended, 
that made the country ``high for a little while'' and created an atmosphere 
where the leaders could ignore the economy because ``we seemed to 
be muddling through.'' While Luzhkov did not single out any Russian 
leaders for specific criticism, he went to great lengths to distance 
Moscow from the rest of Russia. Saying he disagreed with Russia's 
decision to call a moratorium on the repayment of loans, he pledged 
that Moscow would fulfill its obligations to foreign investors. ``Moscow 
is an independent entity. We have an independent government with independent 
authority,'' he said. ``It has its own budget which does not depend 
on anyone and is not accountable to anyone except our Moscow city 
parliament.''
