Reading right now from a bulletin from the associated press, it says 
"the crisis is over. The talks will continue all night." There has 
been a late news development in the Middle East peace talks ongoing 
in the state of Maryland's eastern shore. We want to go to NBC news 
chief foreign affairs correspondent, Andrea Mitchell, monitoring things 
for us all night in the Washington bureau. Officials involved in the 
talks tell me that the Israelis have now decided to stay. They are 
going to be issuing the statement later. Basically they're saying 
they're going to continue talking all night, that they have at least 
resolved the stumbling block over the security issues and will continue 
these negotiations. Now, as we were reporting earlier, U.S. officials 
certainly and other neutral observers believe that the Israelis had 
gotten 95% of what they wanted on the security issues. That was the 
tough issue that led to the stumbling block and was threatening the 
whole summit process. But now apparently they have at least gotten 
some language that is either face-saving enough for the Israelis to 
say, OK, there's some sweetener in this Pot, or there has been a shift 
in the position. But if summit will not be ending and it looks like 
they'll be trying to narrow differences. As we discussed earlier, 
this could also mean that the dramatic arrival and the very presence 
of a man so well liked and so ill right now, king Hussein, might have 
sparked something. That certainly was helpful at a key turning point 
yesterday. I think tonight it was actually the lawyers, the negotiators, 
from the U.S. side sitting with the Israelis and trying to reword, 
braps, that draft agreement so that the Israelis could say they got 
something new. And the Israeli jets were fueled and ready to leave? 
Absolutely. And the Israeli journalists were told, go back to Washington, 
check out of your hotels, and meet us for a 1:00 A.M. departure. That 
will not happen. Andrea Mitchell, thank you. And the headline is they 
will go all night and perhaps into tomorrow, the Middle East peace 
talks with a glimmer of hope as we're on the air here.
