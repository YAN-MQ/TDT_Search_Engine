Wednesday, wet flakes of snow were observed in the hills of southwest 
New York as a stream of very cold air crossed the relatively tepid 
waters of Lake Erie. The trend toward very cool weather will prevail 
over the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States on Thursday as brisk 
breezes from the northwest import chilly air southward from Canada. 
As the cold air gathers heat and moisture in transit over the Great 
Lakes, numerous clouds will form throughout the interior Northeast. 
Scattered rain or snow showers will also occur over northern Pennsylvania, 
upstate New York and northern New England. Farther east, air sinking 
on descent from the Appalachian Mountains will punch holes in the 
cloud cover along the Northeast coast, causing intervals of sunshine 
from Washington, D.C., to Boston. Northerly winds will direct cool 
air into the Southeast. After a chilly start, ample sunshine will 
only boost afternoon readings into the 50s from the upper Tennessee 
Valley to North Carolina. Clear skies and diminishing winds will promote 
rapid cooling Thursday night, setting the stage for frost over portions 
of the interior Southeast. Meanwhile, scattered clouds and showers 
will surround a slow-moving cold front draped over south Florida. 
Showers and spotty thunderstorms will cover much of the interior West 
as a jet stream disturbance intercepts a moist flow of air from the 
southeast. Elsewhere, a surge of warmer air will arrive over the northern 
Plains while mainly sunny and seasonably warm conditions continue 
along the Pacific Coast. FOCUS: THE CLOUD MACHINE This is the time 
of year the cloud machine goes to work in earnest over the Great Lakes. 
Each fall when the first wintry chill sweeps south from central Canada, 
the air near the Great Lakes becomes filled with roiling bands of 
clouds. The temperature of the surface of the water at this time of 
year is mainly in the 50s. Meanwhile, a few thousand feet aloft air 
temperatures can be in the teens and 20s. The strong temperature contrast 
fuels rising currents of moist air which produce clouds and snow squalls, 
much as heating of the earth by the summer sun fuels the updrafts 
that support thunderstorms.
