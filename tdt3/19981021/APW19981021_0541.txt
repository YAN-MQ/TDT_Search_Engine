A Hamas activist who hurled hand grenades at Israeli soldiers earlier 
this week was asked shortly before the attack to become an informer 
for Israel's Shin Bet security service, Israeli newspapers reported 
Wednesday. The dailies cited unidentified Shin Bet officials who confirmed 
earlier Palestinian claims that the Hamas activist, 29-year-old Salem 
Rajab Sarsour, was a double agent. The officials said the recruiting 
plan did not go beyond the initial stages. The Palestinians' West 
Bank security chief, Jibril Rajoub, charged that by approaching Sarsour, 
the Shin Bet was indirectly responsible for Monday's hand grenade 
attack in in the southern Israeli town of Beersheba in which 64 Israelis 
were wounded. Rajoub suggested that Sarsour carried out the attack 
because he wanted to clear himself of suspicions that he collaborated 
with Israel. ``There are documents and evidence that his (Sarsour's) 
response to the attempt to recruit him was to throw grenades and carry 
out terrorist attacks,'' Rajoub told Israel army radio. The new reports 
may prove embarrassing to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
who said the Beersheba attack furnished more proof that the Palestinian 
Authority is not doing enough to fight Islamic militants and prevent 
attacks in Israel. Israel's security demands are a key issue in the 
weeklong Mideast summit talks at Wye Plantation in Maryland. Sarsour, 
a father of five from the West Bank town of Hebron, was arrested on 
Monday morning at the scene of the grenade attack. The army said Sarsour 
also confessed to his interrogators that he killed an elderly rabbi, 
Shlomo Raanan, in Hebron on Aug. 20 and that he hurled hand grenades 
at Israeli troops in the city on Sept. 30. In that attack, two dozen 
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians were injured. The Maariv 
daily quoted senior Shin Bet officials as saying that at the end of 
September, before the Hebron grenade attack, an agent met with Sarsour 
in hopes of recruiting him as an informer. Maariv said Sarsour told 
the agent that collaboration ``could be a good idea'' and agreed to 
meet with the agent again. At the time, security officials thought 
Sarsour was a minor Hamas activist and were unaware he had killed 
Rabbi Ranaan, Maariv said. Maariv had the most detailed account, but 
the Haaretz daily also quoted unidentified Shin Bet agents as saying 
there were attempts to recruit Sarsour as an informer.
