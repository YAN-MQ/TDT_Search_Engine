A retired naval officer and his lawyers expressed cautious optimism 
Wednesday that he will receive a fair trial on charges he revealed 
state secrets about how Russia disposes of nuclear waste. Alexander 
Nikitin, 46, has been charged with treason. Prosecutors are asking 
he be sent to prison for 12 to 20 years. Nikitin pleaded innocent 
when his trial opened Tuesday, more than three years after he was 
first charged with giving secret documents to a Norwegian environmental 
group, the Bellona Foundation. Bellona compiled a 1996 report criticizing 
the handling of nuclear waste and reactors in Russia's Northern Fleet. 
The Defense Ministry decrees that Nikitin is accused of breaking have 
never been published and were shown to his lawyers for the first time 
Tuesday. They argue that under the Russian Constitution, criminal 
charges cannot be filed on the basis of unpublished laws. Nikitin 
and Bellona maintain that the information used in compiling their 
report came from public records. Judge Sergei Golets evicted most 
observers from the court a half-hour after the trial opened. On Wednesday, 
he went through the 30-page indictment and questioned Nikitin, said 
Diederik Lohman, director of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch. 
Defense lawyer Ivan Pavlov was positive about Wednesday's proceedings, 
which lasted only four hours. ``The judge asked questions very calmly 
and professionally,'' he said. Nikitin said the trial was held ``under 
normal working conditions.'' ``The judge questioned me, and he did 
his job in a professional manner,'' he said by telephone from his 
home. ``It is hard for me to evaluate the judge's attitude, but my 
lawyers said he was quite professional.'' Prosecutor Alexander Gutzan 
is expected to question Nikitin on Thursday, as will his own lawyers. 
The first witnesses are expected to be called Friday: Sergei Filipov, 
a former employee of Bellona's Murmansk office, and retired navy officer 
Evgeny Chernov.
