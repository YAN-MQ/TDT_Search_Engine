From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Frank Stachio. 
Trouble at the Middle East peace summit in Maryland. The Israelis 
threaten to walk out in two hours accusing the United States of going 
back on its word on the Palestinians of evasion. But NPR's Ted Clark 
reports U.S. officials have submitted a new draft agreement to the 
Israelis and the Palestinians. American officials say they cannot 
predict whether the two sides will make the difficult decisions for 
peace. Even at this late hour, American officials don't know whether 
this summit will be a success or not. They're simply waiting out to 
see how the two Mid East leaders respond to this draft document which 
they have given to them. NPR's Ted Clark.
