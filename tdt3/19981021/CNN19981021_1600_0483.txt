This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "Headline News weather" 
forecast for Thursday. Cool high pressure will sink into the eastern 
United States, as two cold fronts move into Florida. We'll see showers 
and storms across Florida, perhaps along the gulf coast and back into 
Texas. But most of the rest of the east should be quiet. Maybe a few 
showers along the trough moving off the coast of New England as well. 
Wet weather will persist across the west, with an area of low pressure 
that stretches into the upper atmosphere. The warmest air will be 
across the southeast, the southwest and in the plains states, mostly 
60s and 70s. We'll see 50s in the southern Rockies, just 40s and 50s 
across the northeast and mid-atlantic regions of the United States. 
Looking ahead then to Friday, look for scattered showers again through 
the southern and central Rockies, with some showers moving into the 
northwest. On Saturday, we'll see wet weather in the northwest, and 
on Sunday, same situation. Things do warm up a bit in the east. Don't 
forget, you can find four-day forecasts for 6,100 cities on CNN interactive.
