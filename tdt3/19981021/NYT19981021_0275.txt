CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ ``Theater of Drawing,'' an exhibition of Robert 
Wilson's early artwork at the Harvard University Graduate School of 
Design, offers evocative emanations of the director's performance 
events. The carefully selected items _ drawings, pages from his notebooks 
and sculptural objects _ conjure atmosphere and environment. On their 
own terms they have an artistic appeal. The display, which runs through 
Oct. 29, coincides with the presentation of Harvard's Excellence in 
Design Award to Wilson. Wilson's theater pieces are created for the 
moment, although that moment, at least in his early work, can last 
a week. This was the case with ``Ka Mountain and Guardenia Terrace,'' 
which took place on a mountain near Shiraz, Iran, over a period of 
seven days in 1972. By definition, the work is evanescent, living 
on in the memories of those who witnessed it. Some of the plays, like 
``Einstein on the Beach,'' have been preserved on tape. But a printed 
text cannot capture the full flavor of Wilson's work in performance. 
The vision is so vast that no theater is likely to attempt a production 
of ``Einstein'' or his other plays, at least not without the active 
participation of the director. While all this is true, something else 
does survive from the original productions: the design elements and 
the details of the process that led to the finished piece. Wilson 
is a graphic artist as well as a performance artist and director with 
a great sense of the visual. In that sense, he is in the theatrical 
tradition of Alfred Jarry and Antonin Artaud, who were artists as 
well as playwrights. Wilson's art has been exhibited in museums and 
in galleries, more in Europe than the United States. Many of his drawings 
_ and his furniture _ are in private collections. The Harvard show 
(curated by Brooke Hodge) is small, compact and representative of 
the range of his artistry. In the gallery at Harvard, the work is 
aligned like a series of stage sets. Clean white boxes, the size of 
rooms, contain diverse creative material: storyboardlike pages from 
his 17 notebooks, large framed drawings, chairs, costumes and photographs. 
The pristine quality of the show and its emblematic nature are characteristic 
of the director's work on stage. With ``Ka Mountain,'' there is a 
short film (by Paul Kaiser) in which Wilson's spoken comments are 
interspersed with animated drawings of the event itself. He recalls 
the expedition spiraling up the mountain while the film omits a visualization 
of the more ambitious aspects, of what Wilson describes as a ``30-foot 
spinning fire'' and adds, ``Then we blew up the top of the mountain 
with dynamite.'' At least in this case, one would have had to be there. 
When Wilson was in Crete preparing that project, he kept notebooks, 
some of which are on exhibition. As Geoffrey Wexler, Wilson's archivist, 
writes in the brochure accompanying the show, those notebooks ``reflect 
both a focused concentration on detail and a passionate desire to 
break out into limitless open spaces.'' ``Ka Mountain'' represented 
a turning point in his career. Since then, his work has been indoors 
and primarily on a proscenium stage. The exhibition helps restore 
``Ka Mountain'' to a live event. The same sense of restoration, or 
at least approximation, is true of ``The Life and Times of Joseph 
Stalin,'' ``Einstein on the Beach'' and ``A Letter for Queen Victoria,'' 
the other plays covered in the Harvard exhibition. ``Joseph Stalin,'' 
a dusk-to-dawn vigil, recapitulated aspects of previous work (including 
``Deafman Glance''), becoming a kind of Wilsonian compendium. Here 
it is illustrated by excerpts from his lavish notebooks and a pair 
of chairs (fiberglass covered with thick lead sheeting). Over headphones, 
in an odd anachronism, one can hear the melancholic singing of Woody 
Guthrie's ``Going Down the Road Feeling Bad.'' ``Einstein,'' the operatic 
collaboration with Philip Glass that was Wilson's debut at the Metropolitan 
Opera House in 1976, introduced him to a wider New York audience. 
In the exhibition there is a model set of a courtroom scene and a 
large drawing that looks like a mysterious tower. Actually it is Wilson's 
depiction of a Sanitation Department building that he can see from 
a window in his West Side apartment. Wilson's chairs are like no other 
furniture: The large blocky armchairs designed to conjure the British 
monarchy are giant monoliths. Next to the thin-wired Einstein chair 
(constructed from galvanized pipe) is a placard informing the viewer 
that Einstein said that if his life had taken a different turn, he 
would have preferred plumbing as a trade. The chairs are the opposite 
of welcoming, but in a photograph in the brochure the director is 
seen sitting in one of his creations looking as comfortable as if 
he were watching television. Though the director always has a team 
of supportive helpers, some scenic effects have disappeared, perhaps 
partly as a result of his peregrinations across Europe. The ``Queen 
Victoria'' chairs were found in storage in Zurich, and the backdrop 
from that show was discovered in a Dumpster outside the director's 
New York office. Not on exhibition are examples of his lighting techniques, 
those pillars of white light that he has used to scenic effect in 
plays and operas, including ``Lohengrin,'' which opened last March 
to a vocally negative Metropolitan Opera audience. When that opera 
recently returned to the repertory, it was greeted with enthusiasm, 
as the audience chorused its approval. Although the items in the exhibition 
were integral to the productions, they exist as art objects unattached 
to a performance event. Some notebook sketches, collaged with clippings 
and picture postcards (one of the main street in his hometown, Waco, 
Texas) are not so distant from artists like Joseph Cornell. If there 
is any lingering question about Wilson's credentials as an artist, 
it is answered in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, currently the home 
for an exhibition of Monet. Near the Monets is a room of contemporary 
sculpture: a Sol Lewitt boxlike construction made from sprayed aluminum, 
a collage of cardboard boxes by Robert Rauschenberg, a pair of Josef 
Beuys light bulbs, all of which could be used with scenic effectiveness 
in a Robert Wilson play. Next to them is one of Wilson's ``Einstein'' 
chairs, looking very much at home in company with work by other experimental 
artists.
