The third round of four-party Korean peace talks has begun in Geneva. 
Negotiators from North Korea, South Korea, the United States and China 
gathered to resume discussions aimed at forging a permanent Korean 
peace treaty. However, two previous rounds ended without apparent 
success. The last round broke down over North Korean demands for withdrawal 
of U.S. troops in South Korea.
