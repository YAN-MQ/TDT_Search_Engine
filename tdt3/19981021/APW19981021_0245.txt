Workers on strike at a broadcasting center in eastern Siberia have 
cut off television and radio transmissions to their region, a news 
report said Wednesday. The workers at the Radio and Television Broadcasting 
Center in Chita, about 4700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, 
stopped broadcasts because they haven't received their wages since 
February, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. More than a million people 
have been affected by the action, which is blocking the transmission 
of three national television channels, one local TV channel, and radio 
broadcasts. Regional leaders have tried to persuade the protesters 
to end their strike or take different action, but no compromise has 
been reached yet. The government's chronic inability to pay salaries 
on time has led to frequent, mostly small-scale strikes across the 
country. Protesters have blocked railways and roads, held their bosses 
hostage, and threatened to kill themselves to dramatize their demands 
for back wages.
