an Egyptian suspect in last year's massacre of 62 people in Luxor, 
Egypt, has been arrested in Colombia. The head of Colombia's secret 
police says the suspect was taken into custody in Bogota Monday and 
flown to Ecuador. We have details from correspondent George Meek in 
our South America bureau. Colombia's secret police say they sent 37-year-old 
Habib Abdel el-Alb back to Ecuador because he entered the country 
illegally and no other government requested his extradition. The alleged 
terrorist was arrested Monday when he came to Bogota by bus from Ecuador 
after being denied a Colombian visa. Colombian police say Mr. Al-Alb 
is a key figure in the Egyptian terrorist group responsible for a 
hotel bombing in Cairo two years ago, which killed a score of people, 
and another attack last year in Luxor that killed 60 people. The main 
targets of the group, called Yama al-Islamia are foreign tourists 
in Egypt. George Meek, VOA NEWS, Rio de Janiero.
