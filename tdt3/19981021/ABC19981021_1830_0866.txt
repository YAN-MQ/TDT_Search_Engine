Which brings us to Sammy Sosa. When hurricane georges had finished 
with the Caribbean, no place was in any worse shape than the Dominican 
republic. And as Dominicans try to recover, they say thank goodness 
for one caring ballplayer. ABC's JuJu Chang went home with him. Americans 
cheered Sammy Sosa for this. Swung long. There is goes! Ask and you 
shall receive. But in his hometown of San Pedro de macoris, people 
take pride in his humble beginnings. He's never forgotten about his 
people, for him, his people always come first. His return here was 
an emotional turning point, after the battering they took from hurricane 
georges. Sammy Sosa is not just a baseball star. Here practically 
a patron Saint. In the month since hurricane georges hit the Caribbean, 
Sosa has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. Welcome. Thank you 
so much. His foundation, is working with the red cross, sending tons 
of rice and beans and water to a land where 80% of crops were washed 
way. It's shocking that we can have this level of devastation, this 
level of poverty just a 90-minute flight from Miami. Which is something 
Sosa doesn't want Americans to forget. Anything that the people of 
America can do, can help. It don't have to be tons of money or tons 
of stuff. It can be $1, one pair of shoes. That dollar could help 
elissa Perez who shares this classroom, turned Shelter, with nine 
other families. She lost everything in the storm. "Many days go by 
without anything to feed the children," she says. Relief workers fear 
vast food shortages and widespread disease in the coming months, which 
is why Dominicans are counting on Sosa for so much. JuJu Chang, ABC 
News, San Pedro de macoris.
