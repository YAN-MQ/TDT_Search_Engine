And from our police files, it looked like a rodeo on the streets of 
Anaheim, California. Actually, it was just an escaped bull. The bull, 
named Nighthawk, had pushed its way through a metal holding gate after 
a bull-riding show. The bull proceeded to try to walk around town. 
The owner of the bull grabbed a rope, got on a horse, and chased the 
animal - with the help of a cowboy. Police flew overhead in a helicopter 
and held back traffic in usually busy Anaheim. The pair on the ground 
eventually lassoed the bull in front of a car dealership.
