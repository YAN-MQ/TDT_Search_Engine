Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA NEWS NOW, coming to you from Washington. 
It's coming up on 22 hours universal time. That means we're saying 
good night to most of our listeners in the Middle East and North Africa. 
Thanks for being with us and please tune in again tomorrow beginning 
at 4 hours universal time when VOA NEWS NOW resumes on 7.17, 11.965 
and 15.205 megahertz short wave. If you're listening in the Persian 
Gulf area right now, we invite you to stay with us for another couple 
of hours on medium wave at 15.48 kilohertz. And if you're listening 
in the eastern Mediterranean, we will be back on the air with VOA 
NEWS NOW 30 minutes from now on 1260 kilohertz medium wave. Here's 
a frequency change if you're listening in Africa. We're now going 
off 15.41, 15.445, 15.58 and 17.725 megahertz short wave. We invite 
you to retune to 7.34 megahertz or any of our other remaining frequencies. 
For listeners in Europe, we are going off WRN-1 via Astra. We will 
resume broadcast....
