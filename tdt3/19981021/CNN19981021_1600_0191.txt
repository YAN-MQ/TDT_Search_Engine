You have to be at least 21 to buy beer, but anyone with a TV can enjoy 
the commercials. Don Knapp reports some analysts say that's a problem. 
bud. Animated animals, humor and music. Researchers say this beer 
commercial has exactly the stuff kids like. And if they like the commercial, 
researchers say, the kids are likely to go the next step. Now, what 
we've found is that the more kids like the ads -- and as a result 
they pay more attention to them -- the more likely they are to be 
drinkers, and the more often they drink. At a meeting of the American 
academy of pediatrics in San francisco, researcher Joel grube said 
more and more studies show a Connection between media messages about 
alcohol, and teen drinking. But beer companies deny they market to 
kids. We're very careful not to place any beer advertising where the 
audience is a majority of people who are under the legal purchase 
age. Listen to the words, listen to the words. Live it, love it say 
it, play it take it, pull it Live it, love it, say it, take it, pull 
it. There's like a lesson in adolescent behavior. Peter debenedittis 
deconstructs beer and wine commercials, takes them apart to help kids 
see beyond the powerful and glamorous images. If you go frame by frame, 
you see that there was a jump cut. Well, in this frame, you're looking 
at nudity on national TV. And on this frame, when they jump to it, 
you can see that her chest is exposed. This is kind of the bottom 
line of alcohol advertising. It's the adolescent male fantasy -- the 
beer and the alcohol is the woman. If you'll just drink, you'll get 
these things. Sex, alcohol and rock 'N' roll. Researchers say they're 
the ingredients of the ads kids love to watch. And if they can't stop 
kids from seeing them, perhaps they can be taught to see through them.
