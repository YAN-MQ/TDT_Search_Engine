Substitute Wagneau Eloi snatched an 80th minute winner to give Lens 
a 1-0 victory over Panathinaikos in the Champions League on Wednesday. 
Eloi, unmarked only seven meters from goal, latched onto a long Tony 
Vairelles cross before calmly stroking the ball past goalkeeper Josef 
Wandzik. Lens put its opponents under tremendous pressure earlier 
in the match but rarely looked like scoring against a displined Greek 
rear guard. It came closest in the 23rd minute when Pascal Nouma tapped 
in a Stephane Dalmat cross but was judged offside. Minutes later, 
Wandzik saved well from a close-range Nouma shot. Winger Vairelles 
was the source of Lens' best attacking moves and nearly scored his 
third European goal of the season on the hour. But Wandzik was equal 
to his 15-yard folly. The result leaves Lens with five points and 
the Greek side with three points from three games.
