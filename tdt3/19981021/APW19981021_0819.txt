Students may have thought their teacher had hit the ceiling Wednesday 
when she shouted at them to leave the room immediately. But she was 
keeping the ceiling from hitting them. Seconds after the 26 students 
fled the classroom at Marselisborg Gymnasium in Aarhus, the 40-square-meter 
(430-square-foot) ceiling fell in one piece. There were no injuries, 
Danish radio reported. During a Danish lesson, the teacher, whose 
name was not given, noticed the celling was arching downwards and 
yelled for the students to leave. The ceiling was a construction of 
plaster and isnulation that had been attached to the building's original 
ceiling five years ago to help absorb noise.
