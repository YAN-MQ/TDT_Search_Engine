This is Dennis Michael with the "Hollywood Minute." The longest-running 
show in Broadway history is headed for home video. The original cast 
of "cats" performed the acclaimed musical at London's adelphi theater. 
It took 18 days and 16 cameras to shoot for home video. "Cats" will 
finally come to home video late this month from polygram home video.
