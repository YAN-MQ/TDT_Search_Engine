Two-time Major League Soccer champion D.C. United plays the Columbus 
Crew Wednesday night for a place in the league championship game, 
the MLS cup. As David Bird reports, the best-of-three-game Eastern 
Conference finals will be decided on United's home field at Washington's 
RFK Stadium. D.C. United enjoys a spotless record at home in the post-season. 
The two-time MLS champion club has never lost at home in the playoffs 
and has never lost to Columbus at home. The United won game one of 
the Eastern Conference finals at home 2-0 October 12th, but lost game 
two 4-2 in Columbus last Sunday. Wednesday's game could be the last 
one at D.C. United for Coach Bruce Arena, who has been singled out 
as Steve Sampson's replacement as the U.S. National Team coach. D.C. 
United General Manager Kevin Paine says Arena's future has taken a 
back seat to winning the MLS cup. Whatever happens with Bruce is going 
to happen. It doesn't interfere with what we're trying to do now. 
This is a veteran group of players. It's a very professional team, 
and you know, we're going to do our business. The Columbus Crew is 
trying to make it to the MLS cup for the first time in its history. 
The MLS cup championship game is October 25th at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena, California. In Washington, I'm David Bird, VOA SPORTS.
