Cuban President Fidel Castro has admitted to sending Cuban citizens 
to the United States - all of that to gather intelligence on activities 
of exile groups. In a CNN television interview broadcast on Tuesday, 
Mr. Castro said Cuba has the right to infiltrate what he calls "counterrevolutionary 
organizations" to obtain information about possible terrorist activities 
against Cuba. Havana has accused U.S.-based exile groups from Cuba 
of committing terrorist acts on the island, but the groups deny the 
allegations. Mr. Castro also accused the United States of spying extensively 
on Cuba. He claims he cannot make a telephone call to a Latin American 
leader without Washington knowing about it.
