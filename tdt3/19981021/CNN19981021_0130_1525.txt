Every once in a while, there's a story about an everyday individual 
that reaffirms people's faith in humanity. Greg LaMotte tells us about 
a volunteer who is giving back to an organization that has given him 
so much. Good boy. hi! Fred Blount is a very unusual young man. He 
was born with a rare spinal disease and is confined to a wheelchair. 
But getting around on wheels instead of legs has never stopped this 
26-year-old from enjoying life. As a youngster, he found happiness 
and friendship at the local boys and girls club. The fact that everybody 
accepted me. From the staff to the kids, they all accepted me for 
who I am and not what i'm in. And that's what made it the most positive 
thing for me. Blount loved the boys and girls club so much, at age 
13 he began working at the club as a volunteer. 13 years later, Fred 
Blount, each and every day, wheels himself down the street, gets on 
the bus and rides to the boys and girls club he grew to love. He spends 
40 hours a week there as a volunteer. Who else? Darren, you want to 
play? Just like when he was kid, boys and girls converge at the club 
for games, fun and friendship. Blount is loved, and his presence there 
is inspirational. I think the number-one thing that I've really enjoyed, 
and I've known him since he started coming here as a child, I've never 
seen the young man down. I've never seen him feel sorry for himself. 
He's always smiling. He's always in a positive attitude. He's always 
up and happy. There it is. Oh, yeah. He's also got a pretty good shot 
on the basketball court. But working with the children is what Blount 
loves most. All right, Robert and Amber. What is it that you like 
about the boys and girls club? The fact that I can see these kids 
develop and grow into productive young men and women when they get 
older. Learn to get along with each other. Fred Blount, the epitome 
of real volunteerism. All right! Catching up. Greg LaMotte, CNN, Stanton, 
California.
