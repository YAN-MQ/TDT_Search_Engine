Germany's Social Democrats have reached a coalition agreement with 
the environmentalist Green Party. As Suzanne Kelly reports from Bonn, 
the agreement marks a significant change in the shape of German politics. 
The Social Democrats, the SPD, led by Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, 
and the Greens have been negotiating an agreement since the SPD ousted 
the Christian Democrats of Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections last 
month. The coalition talks were the quickest in post-war German history 
and will give the Greens their first power at the federal level. The 
environmental party, which traces its roots to the peace movement 
of the 1960s, has made Germany's allies nervous with demands like 
a call to reorganize NATO. The coalition deal hammered out in less 
than three weeks will give the SPD control of 13 of Germany's 16 cabinet 
positions. The other three will go to the Greens, including the position 
of foreign minister, which will be filled by Greens party leader, 
Yaska Fischer. At the top of the agenda of the new government is the 
task of lowering Germany's 10 percent unemployment rate, and implementing 
long-needed tax reforms. Suzanne Kelly for VOA NEWS, Bonn.
