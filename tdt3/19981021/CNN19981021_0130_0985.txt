A new poll shows Americans believe the gap between rich and poor is 
growing. 67% of respondents described themselves as haves. 24% deemed 
themselves have nots. Most of the respondents said money and wealth 
should be more evenly distributed. Even so, most people believe more 
Americans are getting rich. 74% said they believe the number of wealthy 
is increasing. That's up from 65% in 1990.
