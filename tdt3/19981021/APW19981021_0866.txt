Rebels took control of Guinea-Bissau's second-largest city Wednesday, 
apparently marking a return to an all-out civil war in the tiny west 
African nation. The rebels announced in a radio broadcast that they 
had taken Bafata, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of the Bissau, 
the capital. The claim was corroborated by aid workers in the country 
and Portuguese diplomats. A three-month truce ended Sunday in the 
former Portuguese colony when rebels clashed with government troops 
near the presidential palace in Bissau. ``It looks like they have 
decided to resolve (the dispute) by force,'' a Portuguese foreign 
ministry source said on condition of anonymity. Michael Kleiner, a 
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, 
said the fighting in Bafata was over quickly. He had no information 
on the number of casualties. Earlier Wednesday, government forces 
launched a heavy artillery barrage against rebel positions in the 
western outskirts of the capital. Troops loyal to President Joao Bernardo 
Vieira, supported by forces from neighboring Senegal and the Republic 
of Guinea, used rocket-launchers and artillery guns to pound rebels 
who had been advancing on the center of Bissau. Senegal has been readying 
the small airfield in the Bissagos Islands, about 50 kilometers (30 
miles) off the coast, to receive warplanes, possibly for launching 
air strikes against rebel positions, according to reports in Lisbon. 
The rebels _ a dissident army faction led by Brig. Ansumane Mane _ 
have held the main army garrison and airport, in the western outskirts 
of Bissau, for almost five months. The foes had entered into a cease-fire 
on July 26 which was brokered by west African and Portuguese-speaking 
negotiators. The mediators discussed the deployment of a peacekeeping 
force and military observers in Guinea-Bissau, but no deal was reached. 
The surge in fighting deepened the plight of hundreds of thousands 
of refugees throughout the country of 1 million. The Portuguese relief 
group International Medical Assistance said there were some 40,000 
refugees in Gabu, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of Bissau, 
and more were expected. The military rebellion started June 7, following 
Mane's dismissal as Armed Forces chief-of-staff for allegedly running 
guns to Senegal's Casamance separatists.
