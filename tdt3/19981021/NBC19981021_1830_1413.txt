Tomorrow night -- "living longer, living better" -- doctors who specialize 
in treating older patients. As baby boomers age, will there be enough 
to go around? We're not training them on how to provide the best and 
most efficient health care for older people. Who'll take care of America's 
aging baby boomers? Find out tomorrow night here on "Nightly News." 
And up next tonight -- some answers to the question, "whatever happened 
to good service where you shop?" Man : only Afrin has special formulas 
for nasal congestion. Woman : allergy congestion... Child : children's 
congestion. Man : and now, for immediate relief of severe congestion. 
Man : Afrin. I love being out in the sun. It makes me feel so alive.

minimizes, even helps prevent, age spots. And the name? Provital protective
