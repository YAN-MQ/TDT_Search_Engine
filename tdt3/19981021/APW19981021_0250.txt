Norsk Hydro ASA on Wednesday announced a 24 percent decline in its 
net profits for the first nine months of this year, due mainly to 
lower prices for crude oil and fertilizers. The 51-percent state-owned 
concern reported net profits of 3.291 billion kroner (dlrs 435.9 million) 
for January through September, compared with 4.34 billion kroner for 
the same period of 1997. Norsk Hydro is one of Norway's largest companies, 
with divisions for petroleum, petrochemicals, light metals and agricultural 
fertilizers. ``Turbulence in the global economy led to difficult market 
conditions for several of Hydro's main products,'' president and chief 
executive Egil Myklebust said. ``The oil and gas results were hit 
by low prices, and in agriculture pressure on prices and lower deliveries 
produced a much weaker result.'' Despite a slight increase in its 
nine-month operating revenues to 72.093 billion kroner (dlrs 9.56 
billion) from 71.323 billion kroner for the same period of last year, 
operating income for the same periods plunged 41 percent to 5.070 
billion kroner (dlrs 670.9 million). Myklebust said that since there 
is little the company can do about market prices, it must concentrate 
on cutting costs and increasing competitiveness. Norsk Hydro has 38,000 
employees worldwide, and is active in more than 100 countries.
