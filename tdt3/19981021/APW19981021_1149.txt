Stefan Effenberg's goal in first half injury time Wednesday lifted 
Bayern Munich to a 1-0 victory over FC Barcelona, scrambling the standings 
in Group D of the Champions Cup. Effenberg shoved the ball past Dutch 
keeper Ruud Hesp, after Giovane Elber's header dropped at his feet 
inches from the goal, almost two minutes into injury time. ``It's 
a good thing the goal fell at the end of the first half, otherwise 
wasting as many chances as we had can make a club nervous,'' said 
Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. The win moved the German team, which 
needed a win to stay alive in the group, points even at four with 
Barcelona. Munich had entered the match last in the group table, the 
Spanish club in first. Munich threatened the Spanish champions through 
a lively first half, ignited by Mario Basler's hard shot in the opening 
seconds, but was thwarted repeatedly by Hesp's heroics. Barcelona 
dominated the slow second half against a passive Munich, trying to 
protect its lead, but the German keeper Oliver Kahn robbed the Barcelona 
players of several chances. After Rivaldo broke from the pack on a 
free kick, a lunging Kahn fisted the ball away a split second before 
his foot reached the ball in the 67th minute. Kahn also parried a 
blast from the right by Giovanni, another Brazilian, in the 75th. 
While Barcelona wants the Champions Cup to match the feat of rival 
Real Madrid last season, Munich was desperate to prove its prowress 
in the Bundesliga is no fluke. Under Hitzfeld, which led Borussia 
Dortmund to the Champions Cup triumph two years ago, Munich is unbeaten 
in eight matches and off to the fastest start in league history. The 
Brazilian striker Anderson, who had scored three of Barcelona's five 
Champions Cup goals, was reduced to a bystander for most of the match 
by Ghana defender Sammy Kuffour. Munich had another offensive outburst 
to end the match, fueled by speedy reserve striker Alexander Zickler, 
who had several scoring chances.
