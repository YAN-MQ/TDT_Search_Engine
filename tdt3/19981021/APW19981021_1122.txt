A hotly-disputed 80th-minute winner from German striker Juergen Rische 
gave FC Kaiserslautern a 2-1 victory at PSV Eindhoven Wednesday in 
the Champions League. Rische's header was adjudged to have crossed 
the line before it was parried by PSV keeper Ronald Waterreus, but 
the referee gave the goal only after consulting with his assistant. 
Thomas Riedl had only been on the field as a sub for four minutes 
when he pounced on a Marian Hristov knockdown to beat Waterreus with 
a bouncing shot into the corner on 67 minutes. But ten minutes later 
Russian Dmitri Khokhlov drove a grass-cutting shot in from the left 
to score the first Champions League goal against Kaiserslautern this 
year and make it 1-1. With pouring rain and a heavy field a chaotic 
first half still produced a few chances. The first came when PSV's 
Danish winger Dennis Rommedahl broke lose on 21 minutes and rounded 
keeper Andeas Reinike but rolled the ball weakly goalwards only to 
see it cleared off the line. The game caught pace just before the 
half and Kaiserslautern striker Uwe Roesler beat defender Andrius 
Skerla but Waterreus stood his ground well to block at point-blank 
range.
