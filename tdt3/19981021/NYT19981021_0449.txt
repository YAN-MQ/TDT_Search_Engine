Danny Kanell jogged gingerly along the sideline of the practice field 
Wednesday morning, but after 50 yards, he stopped and put his left 
hand to the right side of his chest. ``It's a little sore,'' the Giants' 
quarterback said with a smile. ``But I'll take that.'' Kanell was 
in good spirits hours after getting the news from team doctors that 
the lump removed from his chest Monday was benign. ``They pulled out 
a pretty good sized slab of something,'' said Kanell, who added that 
he would practice next week and play against the Washington Redskins 
on Nov. 1. Kanell said: ``It took about 30 minutes to take it out. 
I was awake, lying there talking to the doctor about his kids and 
football while he was in there sawing away. He was using some kind 
of laser. He kept tugging away.'' Kanell said the lump of tissue removed 
was larger than he had expected it to be. He said he believed it was 
going to be about the size of a grape. On Wednesday, using his fingers 
to demonstrate, Kanell formed a mass about the size of a playing card. 
``They say it's like an iceberg: you only feel the tip, but there's 
more underneath,'' Kanell said. ``It's not that uncommon.'' Kanell 
said he was never very worried that the mass, which he first noticed 
in training camp this summer, was going to pose a serious health problem. 
``I wanted to wait until after the season was over,'' he said. ``Everything 
they told me indicated they were pretty sure it wasn't something to 
be too concerned about. But the doctors said they wanted to be sure 
and that it would be better to get it out. But if we didn't have a 
bye week, and I might have had to miss a game, I probably wouldn't 
have done it.'' Although the team announced Monday that the lump was 
on Kanell's left side, Kanell said it was just under his right nipple. 
The right-handed Kanell said, however, that the lump never affected 
his throwing this season. He also said he did not think that the impending 
surgery ever weighed on his mind. ``I wasn't that worried,'' he said. 
``I think other people around me were more worried than I was. I did 
have to go through ultrasound and a mammogram. I have a new appreciation 
for women who have to go through that. It is the kind of thing that 
opens your eyes to what can happen.'' Kanell kept the surgery a secret 
from most of his teammates, many of whom learned about it from news 
reports Monday and Tuesday. ``Guys have been coming up to me saying: 
`You're OK, right?''' Kanell said. ``I've been telling everyone that 
I'm fine all day.'' Giants linebacker Corey Widmer said, ``It's very 
scary because you're basically a yes or no answer away from changing 
your life.'' Coach Jim Fassel said the three practices Kanell would 
miss this week would not have much effect on his preparation for Washington. 
``I probably would have limited his throwing and practice this week 
even if he didn't have anything done,'' Fassel said. ``It's a good 
week to rest and freshen up.'' Asked whether he thought waiting for 
the surgery influenced Kanell performance on the field, Fassel said, 
``I can't discount that _ that it was on his mind a little.'' Wednesday, 
a jocular Kanell seemed well on his way to putting the event behind 
him. ``I may still be sore, but I'm getting my rest,'' he said. ``After 
the operation, I took the painkillers the doctor gave me and I slept 
the whole day. That was relaxing.''
