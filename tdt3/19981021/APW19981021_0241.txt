How bad are things in Russia? So bad that criminals are even stealing 
the mud. Thieves used a tractor and shovels to make off with eight 
tons of therapeutic, lakeside mud that belonged to a health spa near 
the southern city of Volgograd, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported 
Wednesday. Spa director Svetlana Gnutova said the soothing mud, which 
was hauled away in a truck, was worth about 19,000 rubles (1,100 dollars) 
and had left the spa without enough to service its 200 clients. A 
criminal investigation was underway, she added.
