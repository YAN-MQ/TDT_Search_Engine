The new Mike Myers film, "Austin powers: the spy who shagged me" begins 
production next month. Emmy-winning actress Kristen Johnston will 
appear as a Russian model and ex-KGB agent. Myers and Mike McKullers 
wrote the film, a sequel to "Austin powers: international man of mystery." 
Johnston won a best-supporting actress Emmy last year for her role 
on "3rd rock from the sun."
