Three ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were sentenced Wednesday to between 
three and six years' imprisonment, the state-run Tanjug news agency 
reported. All three had been charged with conspiracy against the state 
and with being members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a guerrilla 
organization fighting for the province's independence from Serbia. 
A district court in Pec handed a six-year prison sentence to Skender 
Racaj from the municipality of Istok, 55 kilometers (34 miles) northwest 
of provincial capital Pristina, for aiding and abetting terrorist 
activities. The same court sentenced Iljmi Zenelji, 24, from a village 
near Klina, 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Pristina, to three years. 
On several occasions, Zenelji had organized supplies and procured 
gasoline for the KLA, the court said. Zenelji's neighbor Sali Gashi, 
31, was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for smuggling machine guns 
and ammunition crates across the border from neighboring Albania in 
June.
