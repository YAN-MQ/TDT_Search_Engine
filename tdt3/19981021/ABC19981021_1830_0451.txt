The purpose of senator John Glenn's return to space is being called 
into question today. The space agency has always maintained that the 
primary reason for him being on the shuttle next week is to take part 
in experiments on aging. But is it still so? Here's ABC's Ned Potter. 
John Glenn said he was flying for science, not just for symbolism. 
He chided reporters for asking so many questions about what a hero 
he was. Too often you get into the human aspect of this, and you don't 
get into the scientific stuff that gets into everybody's house all 
over the country. But now it turns out Glenn will do a little less 
science than originally advertised. In August, he was quietly dropped 
from one high-profile experiment, a test to see if the hormone melatonin 
improves his sleep in flight. Dr. Charles czeisler is the principal 
experimenter. I told him on the night of the 26th of August. But NASA 
and Glenn did not make that decision public, and two weeks later, 
on September 8th, Glenn seemed to sound as if the test was still on. 
We'll see what affect it has or does not have. Senator Glenn says 
at the time he thought the question was still under debate. He will 
still be wired up for a battery of other sleep measurements in flight. 
But some people have been saying all along that his flight is more 
show than substance. NASA knows they've now been given new ammunition. 
The fact that we cannot participate in the melatonin portion of the 
experiment does not in any way negate the value of the experiment. 
Doctors say Glenn's disqualification from that one test has nothing 
to do with his ability to fly, but he had talked of it as one of his 
reasons to fly. Ned Pot every, ABC News, New York.
