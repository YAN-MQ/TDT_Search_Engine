Fed up with unfruitful negotiations with owners and fearing a work 
stoppage that could last into 1999, agents for National Basketball 
Association players are looking into creating their own league. The 
discussion came during a meeting of the agents advisory council in 
Las Vegas Wednesday, where more than 20 player agents and 11 NBA players 
gathered for nearly four hours. Billy Hunter, the union's executive 
director, also announced that it planned to organize exhibition games 
until the lockout is settled. Patrick Ewing, the union president, 
will lead a meeting Thursday that will be open to all players at Caesar's 
Palace. From superstars like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Karl 
Malone to the journeymen Marty Conlon and Muggsy Bogues, about 200 
players are expected to attend as the union tries to show a united 
front during the lockout by the owners. Several agents predicted Wednesday 
that there would be a dispute among the players over whether the players 
should decertify the union and risk a prolonged court battle with 
the NBA. Although decertification came up in the meeting, neither 
the players nor the owners gave it much credence at this point. ``The 
overall tenor was that everybody's on the same page,'' said Keith 
Glass, the New Jersey-based agent. ``We're behind the union. If there 
was a clear sentiment, it's that no one wants to accept the deal the 
owners are offering and we'll stick together until we get what we 
think is a fair deal.'' The meeting came two days after the union 
lost a ruling on its guaranteed contracts before John Feerick, the 
arbitrator who determined that the owners need not pay any players 
during the lockout. The decision affects 226 players with guaranteed 
contracts, which together total nearly $800 million in value. Because 
of the ruling, the agents discussed alternative sources of income 
for players who may struggle financially. Aside from a $25 million 
licensing fee from the league, the union reports only $10 million 
in assets. Hence, the idea behind the exhibition games. ``We plan 
to announce to the players that we're going to be in a position to 
provide financial support to those ballplayers who need it,'' Hunter 
said. ``We intend to, with the assistance of many of the agents, put 
on games. So as long as the lockout continues, we intend to put on 
some games to help raise funds.'' Hunter had explored the possibility 
over the summer, but ran into many obstacles, including scheduling 
and player commitment. Tim Duncan and David Robinson and other NBA 
players are supposed to take part in the first unofficial exhibition 
game Friday in Houston, with proceeds going to players who need help 
financially. It was not clear whether the games would be played in 
NBA cities or elsewhere, or who would participate. The league has 
approved players' earning a living outside the NBA until the lockout 
is settled. ``Of course, they're doing so entirely at their own risk,'' 
said Jeff Mishkin, the league's chief legal counsel. ``If they injured 
themselves and were not able to play basketball, they're at risk of 
having their contracts terminated.'' But one league official doubted 
that the union could stage exhibition games at all. The official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, asserted that the players had 
tried repeatedly to establish a schedule of exhibition games but had 
failed. The union and the agents, however, are looking at an even 
more ambitious idea, the formation of a new league. A four- or five-person 
committee has scheduled a meeting for this morning to discuss economic 
alternatives for the players, said Marc Fleisher, an agent. ``It's 
in the very early stages,'' he said, ``but we're ready to start talking 
to potential owners, broadcasters, investors, anybody out there that 
might make sense.'' The possibility of an alternative to the NBA for 
this season is remote, but several player agents did not discount 
the potential for next season. The idea was contingent on the league 
canceling the entire season. ``For the first time, there was serious 
discussion about the possibility that the whole season could be lost,'' 
said Steve Kauffman, an agent. ``I don't think many of us believed 
that before. But with the way the owners have been behaving, it's 
now something we have to discuss and prepare for.'' According to two 
agents, David Falk, the agent for Jordan and several other superstars, 
said he would approach Jordan to see whether he would be interested 
in such a venture as a new league. ``If Michael is involved, I'd bet 
it would work,'' one agent said.
