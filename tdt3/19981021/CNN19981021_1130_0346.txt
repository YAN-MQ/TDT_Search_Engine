We'll try once again to speak with Chris rosenbloom who is speaking 
at the american dietetic association which is under way in Kansas. 
Can you hear us? I can hear you just fine. Wonderful. We want to talk 
to you about the new study that shows kids out there between 13 and 
18 are drinking a tremendous amount of soda. I guess a lot of parents 
are wondering, you know, what is the right amount should children 
be drinking? Should they drink milk instead of pop? We would love 
to see teenagers get to two or three servings of milk every day but 
we know soft drinks are a part of every kid's diet. They can still 
enjoy and occasional soft drink. What is the big concern? Is the amount 
of sugar in soda, soda companies are saying it's the same amount you 
find in fruit juices. The body does not recognize the difference in 
sugar from a soft drink or fruit juice so I don't think it's the issue 
but rather nutrients. If all they drink, they will miss out on key 
nutrients. This would seem to be particularly alarming when it comes 
to young girls who are drinking more soda and less milk. Don't they 
need it more than the boys? Absolutely. Teenaged girls really need 
the calcium to get their bones to be strong. It's critical to get 
them in the teen years. Girls often drink diet drinks, so if they 
don't like to drink milk, they can try calcium-fortified fruit juice 
as an alternative. Chris, we've run out of time, but thanks for joining 
us today. You're welcome.
