Police said Wednesday they have arrested 68 people in connection with 
a killing spree in which the severed heads of some victims were carried 
on poles through village streets. Vigilante groups formed in the eastern 
end of the main island of Java after more than 150 people, many of 
them Muslim clerics and others accused of witchcraft, were mysteriously 
murdered. Maj. Djoko Hartanto, deputy police chief in the town of 
Malang, said 54 people were arrested for allegedly killing nine suspected 
murderers in an outburst of mob violence. Local residents have turned 
over to police another 14 people, including one woman, who are also 
suspected of being murderers. Hartanto said many of the detainees 
had mental disorders and that police and psychiatrists were examining 
them. On Sunday and Monday, vigilantes beheaded murder suspects and 
paraded their heads on sticks. The killings in revenge attacks began 
Friday in Malang and surrounding areas, about 650 kilometers (400 
miles) east of Jakarta. Many of the victims in the mysterious killings 
that began in August in the regency of Banyuwangi were alleged black-magic 
practitioners and preachers or members of the 30 million-member Nahdlatul 
Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization. Its leaders have called 
for calm and have condemned revenge killings by vigilantes. The government 
has rejected a claim by Nahdlatul Ulama leader Abdurahman Wahid that 
an unidentified Cabinet minister was behind the killings. An official 
said Wednesday, however, that President B.J. Habibie planned to seek 
clarification from Wahid about the allegation. After meeting with 
Habibie, State Secretary Akbar Tandjung said the president would seek 
the clarification after Wahid recovers from illness. The Muslim leader 
was admitted to a hospital Saturday, hours after making the allegation.
