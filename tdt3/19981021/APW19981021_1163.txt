A weak Brondby defense allowed Manchester United to trounce the Danish 
Group D underdogs 6-2 Wednesday in a Champions League match. Ryan 
Giggs opened the score in the second minute on a rain-soaked turf. 
A misunderstanding between goalie Mogens Krogh and defender allowed 
Giggs to easily score on a ball lifted by Wesley Brown. In the 21st 
minute, Giggs headed a second goal on a long shot by Manchester's 
Swedish forward Jesper Blomqvist. Seven minutes later, Andy Cole ran 
past three Brondby defenders and fired a low shot past Krogh. Kim 
Daugaard reduced the score on a free kick in the 35th minute. The 
Danish midfielder gunned a powerful low shot which Manchester's Danish 
goalie, Peter Schmeichel, couldn't stop. Schmeichel was back in business 
Wednesday after he had been out for a few weeks with a stomach injury. 
Although Manchester dominated the match before 40,315 fans at the 
Parken stadium, Brondby didn't give up and gave its former goalie 
Schmeichel a busy evening. In the second half, the confidence gained 
after Daugaard's goal didn't last long for Brondby. Substitute Roy 
Keene headed past Krogh in the 55th minute on a pass from Dwight Yorke 
who, four minutes later, scored Manchester's fifth goal. Another substitute, 
Jordi Cruyff, had been on the turf for less than a minute when the 
Dutch international fired a powerful shot into the Danish champions' 
nets in the 62nd minute. In injury time, Danish international Ebbe 
Sand saved Brondby's honor when he shot past a diving Schmeichel. 
``This is a regular smacking. There are no excuses for it,'' Brondby 
coach Ebbe Skovdahl said. Manchester needed a win to take the lead 
in the group that includes two other European powerhouses, Bayern 
Munchen and Barcelona. Manchester was missing key players like David 
Beckham and Nicky Butt who are suspended, and injured Denis Irwin, 
Teddy Sheringham and Ronny Johnson.
