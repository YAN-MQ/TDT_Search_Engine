A choppy start on Wall Street. Let's get the details from Kitty pilgrim 
at the cnnfn newsroom in New York. Kitty? Hi, Catherine, thanks. Stocks 
are losing ground after moving in and out of positive territory for 
much of the morning. That, despite a positive batch of earnings reports 
from Dow components citigroup, Exxon, and united technologies. Right 
now, the Dow Jones industrial average is -- down about 48 points.
