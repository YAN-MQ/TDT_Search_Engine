The wife of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim says 
she hopes she will not be arrested for meeting with anti-government 
demonstrators. Aviva Ismael says she did nothing wrong Saturday when 
she shook hands with protesters in Kuala Lumpur. Reporters rushed 
to her home today following rumors she would be arrested for violating 
an order not to lead rallies in support of her jailed husband. However, 
authorities took no action against her.
