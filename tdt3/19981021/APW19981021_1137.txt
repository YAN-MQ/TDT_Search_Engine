A first half penalty goal from Mika Lehkosuo and a headed goal by 
Mika Kottila in the second half gave HJK Helsinki a 2-0 victory against 
Benfica in the Champions' League Wednesday. HJK frequently looked 
for the heading ability of its lone striker, the lanky Kottila, with 
midfielders Brazilian Piracaia and Vesa Vasara, providing crosses 
from both flanks. A high ball towards the side of the area led to 
the penalty after 19 minutes. Benfica central defender Paulo Madeira 
used a hand to reach the ball over Kottila's head. Czech referee Vaclav 
Kronov gave the penalty, also booking the Benfica player. Lehkosuo 
coolly rolled the ball down in the right corner, with veteran Belgian 
goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme going the other way. HJK lost the offensive 
Vasara at 28 minutes after a head-on clash with the uncompromising 
British left back Scott Minto. Benfica had most of the possession 
until the interval, but HJK still got the best chance as the bustling 
Albanian Shefki Kuci missed an open goal with his header from a perfect 
cross from the left by Piracaia. In the second half Piracaia hit a 
corner in the 69th minute, and Kottila powered a header into the net. 
Benfica did not get penetration from its strikers Nuno Gomes and Martin 
Pringle who both were substituted in the second half. The best plays 
came on the left through Britons Scott Minto and midfielder Mark Pembridge.
