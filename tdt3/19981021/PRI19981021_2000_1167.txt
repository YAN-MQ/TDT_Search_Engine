Much more news and our Geography Quiz still to come on THE WORLD on 
PRI. That's Public Radio International. If you travel, you know that 
uneasy feeling that can come when you arrive in a strange city and 
you haven't booked a room. You're not exactly homeless but you can't 
relax until you've safely stowed your bags. I'm Lisa Mullins asking 
you to settle in, make yourself at home, and consider making this 
station one of those places you return to again and again. Your membership 
in public radio implies that you're more than a tourist; you're a 
regular here. Please call now and support the station's fund-raising 
effort. Your contribution helps insure that this program in particular 
will still be here the next time you visit. The number to call to 
make your pledge is 215-923-1234. Call collect if it's long distance. 
215-923-1234. Make a pledge of 60 or perhaps $120, maybe even $180 
now at 215-923-1234. Thanks for your support.
