The government Chile has banned demonstrations by supporters and opponents 
of the country's former military leader, Augusto Pinochet. The general 
is under arrest in Britain. Spanish judges are seeking his extradition 
from Britain on charges of genocide. But the Chilean government insists 
the 82-year-old former military ruler has diplomatic immunity. Anna 
Leeka Christy a center right Chilean Parliamentarian protested against 
what she sees as foreign interference in her country's internal affairs. 
We are an autonomous country and we feel very hurt at the grievance 
that has cost Chile the intervention of foreign countries. We solve 
our justice problems in Chile the same way as we don't interfere in 
your political decisions against other situations. Anna Leeka Christy. 
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is calling for the 
release of General Pinochet. She said his help had saved many British 
lives during the Falklands war against Argentina in 1982.
