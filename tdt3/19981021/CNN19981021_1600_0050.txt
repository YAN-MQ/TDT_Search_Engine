Though Israeli sources say the mideast peace talks in Maryland are 
in a Crisis, the United States is not giving up. The state department 
says the U.S. is working to provide both sides with the draft text 
of an interim agreement. It says the bulk of the text will contain 
what the parties have agreed to so far, but would include brackets 
where the two sides disagree. That includes security issues. Israeli 
sources say Palestinian negotiators are not meeting Israeli security 
requirements. The Palestinians say that's not true, and they have 
agreed to a Comprehensive plan that was delivered to the Israelis 
by President Clinton. State department spokesman James Rubin says 
the United States will stay at the talks as long as the other parties 
are willing. We've been here for seven days and seven nights. The 
president has spent tens of hours working the issues. We want to do 
all we can reasonably can do to provide constructive solutions to 
real problems. But we can't hold people here against their will, and 
we can't make them make the tough choices. The Israeli delegation 
is threatening to leave the talks.
