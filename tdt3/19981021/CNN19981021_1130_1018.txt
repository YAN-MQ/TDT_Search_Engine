The housing market seems to be cooling off. Construction starts on 
new homes and apartments fell 2.5% in September, the second monthly 
drop in a row. Housing activity in the south was especially slow, 
due to hurricane georges. And it doesn't look like activity will be 
picking up any time soon. Applications for building permits fell 4.5%, 
the biggest monthly drop in three years.
