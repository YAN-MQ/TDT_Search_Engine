Jordan and Britain are holding joint war games involving about 1,200 
soldiers in infantry drills lasting more than a month, a British Embassy 
statement said Wednesday. It said ``Exercise Saffron Sands'' began 
in early October and will run until mid-November but gave no exact 
dates. Jordanian army officials were not immediately available for 
comment. The statement said the exercise, part of annual drills between 
the two countries, involves a British force of nearly 600 men and 
a similar number of Jordanians. ``Training by British military units 
is regularly carried out in Jordan due to the excellent links between 
the two countries' armed forces and ... the excellent facilities for 
training'' in Jordan, the statement said. It did not give the site 
of the exercise, but similar drills with Britain last October were 
held in the desert town of Qatrana, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south 
of Amman. Jordan also holds military exercises with the United States 
and Turkey aimed at improving the defense tactics of its 100,000-strong 
army, which has suffered in the last decade because of the state's 
dlrs 6.1 billion foreign debts.
