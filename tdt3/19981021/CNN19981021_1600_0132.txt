A consumer group says one of the biggest health threats to U.S. teenagers 
isn't alcohol or tobacco, but soft drinks. The center for science 
in the public interest says the average teen consumes up to three 
times the amount of sugar as government guidelines recommend. Most 
of that comes from sodas. The center says Americans spend $54 billion 
a year on sodas. Consumption has increased 43% since 1985. The center 
also found milk consumption is down 40%. It says that could partly 
explain why only one-third of teens are getting the recommended amount 
of calcium. Teenage girls really need the calcium. To get their bones 
to be strong throughout life, it's critical to get calcium in the 
teen years. Girls often drink diet drinks instead of other, more nutritious 
beverages. So if they don't like to drink milk, they can try yogurt, 
or they can try calcium-fortified fruit juice as an alternative. The 
soda industry says the group is stirring up unfounded consumer alarm.
