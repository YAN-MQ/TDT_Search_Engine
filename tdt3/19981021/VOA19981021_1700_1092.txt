Time now for sports, with VOA's Steve Shy and he's joined us here 
in the studio and he's got some exciting news about what's going on 
in the World Series baseball games. Well, that's right, Susan. There 
could be a sweep tonight. The New York Yankees can capture their 24th 
Major League Baseball World Series title Wednesday as they try to 
complete a four-game sweep of the San Diego Padres. The Yankees took 
a three-games-to-none lead in the best-of-seven series Tuesday night. 
They rode Scott Brosius's second homerun of the game, a three-run 
blast in the eighth inning, to come from behind and beat the Padres 
5-4 in San Diego. Brosius says it was a dream come true. This is the 
type of thing that you - as a kid, you dream about, you know, something 
I've done in my backyard a hundred times. And you never know if it's 
- if you ever need the opportunity to do it. And to come out and to 
do something to help the team win feels real good. After posting an 
American League record, 114 wins in the regular season, the Bronx 
Bombers can put the finishing touches on one of the greatest seasons 
in baseball history. New York pitcher David Cohn agrees. We're on 
the brink of something really special. I mean, there's going to be 
a lot of arguments historically about where this team fits in, but 
right now, we've got one more game to go. We've worked hard all year. 
It's the most professional team. It's the best team in baseball. A 
victory Wednesday night would give New York a record of 125 wins and 
just 50 losses over the regular season. Now, that includes an 11-and-2 
mark in the post-season. Andy Petit will make his third World Series 
start as he tries to wrap up the title for the Yankees. The Padres 
will counter with their ace, Kevin Brown.
