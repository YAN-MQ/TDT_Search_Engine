Baseball has always drawn Chuck Knoblauch and his father together, 
the time spent in the car going to Little League and high school games, 
the hours of playing catch in the back yard. So, after Knoblauch slugged 
a game-tying three-run homer in Game 1 of the World Series, he settled 
on the Yankee bench and thought of his father, Ray, who is suffering 
from Alzheimer's disease. Ray Knoblauch was at his home in Houston 
for Games 1 and 2, but he and Linda Knoblauch, his wife, are here 
for the next three days as the Yankees try to win the World Series 
for the 24th time. David Cone was to pitch against San Diego's Sterling 
Hitchcock Tuesday night. Chuck Knoblauch was to bat leadoff and play 
second base for the Yankees, duties he performed exceptionally in 
the first two games. With four hits in seven at-bats, including his 
home run, Knoblauch is a front-runner to be named the Series' most 
valuable player. Tony Gwynn, San Diego's perennial batting champion, 
said that neutralizing Knoblauch was crucial for the Padres. ``He's 
the feisty guy who will stand there and take pitches and foul pitches 
and get hit by pitches,'' Gwynn said, ``and he can swing the bat. 
He's got a great eye, and he gives them exactly what they need.'' 
The roots of Knoblauch's game were sown by his father, a former minor 
league pitcher and well-known figure in Houston amateur baseball as 
the coach at Bellaire High School. Ray Knoblauch built a mound for 
his son behind their home, a strip of rubber across the summit, regulation 
distance for Little League, and they would play catch. Chuck shared 
his father's passion for the game and would go on to be a star. In 
time, grass grew over the top of the mound. Ray Knoblauch began jumbling 
words years ago, began struggling with certain phrases, to the point 
that his family wondered whether he was all right. ``I remember talking 
to him at the time and asking him how he felt, and he would say, `I'm 
fine,''' Chuck Knoblauch said. But the son, playing for the Minnesota 
Twins then, arranged for a doctor at the Mayo Clinic to examine his 
father after the 1996 season. ``It's an uncomfortable thing, trying 
to get someone to get tested and go for a checkup,'' Knoblauch said. 
``He was having a hard time with it, because I don't think he really 
understood why he was having tests.'' The tests mostly ruled out possible 
problems, tumors or a stroke, and Chuck Knoblauch was told that Alzheimer's 
can be confirmed only by an autopsy. But he saw the results of a brain 
scan done on his father, and there were dark spots, signs of a larger 
problem. The doctor did not use the word Alzheimer's when discussing 
the illness with Ray Knoblauch, but the doctor did tell him he could 
not drive anymore. It was, the son believes, perhaps the hardest part 
of the Mayo process, for his mother and for his father, always extremely 
independent. Alzheimer's advances in stages, and treatment aims to 
retard the progression of the disease as long as possible with medication. 
Although Ray Knoblauch's communication skills have been affected, 
he recognizes Chuck, who believes his father comprehends what is happening 
and can watch a baseball game and understand. ``It's something you 
struggle with, because some days you don't know how to handle it,'' 
Knoblauch said. ``Being at the Mayo Clinic helped, and you try to 
have some sympathy for what he's going through and realize what my 
mom is going through. ``It would be a lot more difficult for me if 
I was seeing him on a daily basis, if I was going through what my 
mom goes through every day, not knowing what type of person you're 
going to get each morning when they wake up. But still, it's a no-hope 
type of disease.'' Ray Knoblauch spent a week at spring training this 
year, ``and he was pretty badly off,'' his son said. The father did 
not make the trip to Arlington, Texas, when the Yankees went there 
in May, the first time since his son has played in the big leagues 
that he did not make that trip. But Ray Knoblauch, 70, did visit when 
the Yankees went back to Texas in August. ``It was the first time 
I saw my dad as an old man,'' Knoblauch said. ``In the 30 years I'd 
been alive, my dad always looked exactly the same. In Arlington, he 
was walking around really gingerly, like he might fall down, really 
tired, laying around. ``But then when I saw him again'' _ during the 
playoffs in Texas earlier this month _ ``he was so much better. He 
was good, and he was talking, and it was really good seeing him there.'' 
Knoblauch made a mental blunder in Game 2 of the American League Championship 
Series against Cleveland, arguing a call rather than pursuing the 
baseball, as the Indians scored the decisive run in the 12th inning. 
He acknowledged his mistake the next day and has felt better since 
then, played better, saved from longtime ridicule when the Yankees 
advanced to the Series. Standing in the clubhouse here on Monday, 
Knoblauch said: ``You don't want to minimize this job we have; it's 
a professional thing. But in the same sense, when you put everything 
in perspective, it's just really very small considering all the trouble 
in the world.'' He mentioned Darryl Strawberry. ``There are people 
laying in hospitals with cancer, people with Alzheimer's,'' Knoblauch 
said. ``What's going on with Strawberry, that's life and that's real.'' 
Knoblauch saw the movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' and hopes he always 
remembers what he felt as he walked away, his sense of life's tenuous 
nature.
