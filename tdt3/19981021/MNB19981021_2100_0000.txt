Things are stirring again on Capitol Hill. They're trying to avoid 
a major shake-up as the house heads into the formal impeachment proceedings. 
The judgment of the president in Congress is nearing. Today, where 
have all the wise men gone and who are they today? We'll talk to one 
man who's been mentioned, former ambassador, strausestrause. And with 
the Middle East peace talks on the brink of collapse, enter the king 
in many ill health, king Hussein, who joins at a crucial time. And 
good Wednesday evening to you. As we go on the air tonight, the talks 
aimed at peace in the Middle East are in grave condition, and we're 
going to get a live update in a few moments. Also this evening our 
discussion of Washington's wise men and who is left to counsel this 
commander-in-chief. We'll get a preview of what the morning's "New 
York Times" is writing along with the rest of the papers here this 
Wednesday evening.
