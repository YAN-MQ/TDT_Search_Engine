The United States is determined to see Caspian oil transported through 
Turkey and will continue efforts to make the Baku-Ceyhan route a reality, 
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday. ``Overall, 
Baku-Ceyhan offers the best option from environmental, economic and 
strategic standpoints,'' Eizenstat told reporters. Eizenstat's statements 
followed an announcement that the U.S. Export-import Bank has offered 
a dlrs 827,000 loan to help finance a pipeline linking the Azeri capital 
of Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Another dlrs 
823,000 grant from a U.S. trade and development agency for consultant 
services will be signed shortly, said Eizenstat, who was in Turkey 
for a meeting of the U.S.-Turkey Joint Economic Commission. ``No one 
should underestimate our determination to make Baku-Ceyhan a reality,'' 
he said. Companies from the United States and seven other nations 
are to make a final decision on the pipeline route on October 29. 
According to some reports, the companies may favor shorter and cheaper 
routes, including pipelines already being built from Azerbaijan to 
the port of Supsa, on Georgia's Black Sea coast, or an enlarged pipeline 
along the same route. Turkey strongly objects to the proposals because 
they would require the oil to be loaded into tankers and shipped through 
Turkey's narrow Bosporus Strait, which would increase the risk of 
oil tanker accidents. ``We cannot turn our straits into a virtual 
pipeline just because some oil companies want to make more money,'' 
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday. The Turkish proposal for 
a 1,730-kilometer (1,081-mile) pipeline would cost dlrs 2.5 billion 
dlrs. Turkey has said it would construct part of the pipeline on its 
own but it was not clear if the offer would help tip the balance in 
Turkey's favor. Eizenstat also praised the preliminary agreement reached 
Tuesday between Turkey and Turkmenistan to build a pipeline to carry 
Turkmenistan's natural gas across the Caspian Sea to Turkey.
