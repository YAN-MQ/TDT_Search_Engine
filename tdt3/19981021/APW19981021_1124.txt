Radioactive ants, flies and gnats have been found at the Hanford nuclear 
complex, bringing to mind those Cold War-era B horror movies in which 
giant, mutant insects are the awful price paid for mankind's entry 
into the Atomic Age. Officials at the most contaminated nuclear site 
in the United States insist there is no danger of Hanford becoming 
the setting for a '90s version of ``Them!,'' the 1954 movie starring 
James Arness and James Whitmore in which huge, marauding ants are 
spawned by nuclear experiments in the desert. Although Hanford is 
working to eradicate its ``hot'' insects, officials said the radioactivity 
the pests carry is slight and no threat to neighboring communities. 
``We're not dealing with an insect that would leave and all of a sudden 
start to give birth to these malformed, horrible insects,'' said a 
chuckling Richard Zack, an entomologist at Washington State University 
in Pullman. The situation came to light in September when red harvester 
ants found underground near some old waste pipes were discovered to 
be radioactive. Then, earlier this month, workers discovered radioactive 
flying insects around cans where the staff's day-to-day nonradioactive 
garbage is thrown away. That led Fluor Daniel Hanford, the company 
that manages Hanford for the Energy Department, to check the town 
dump where Hanford garbage is taken. Workers found trash that had 
apparently become radioactive from contact with the bugs, and sent 
210 tons of it back to Hanford for burial. Still, a person would have 
had to stand next to a spot contaminated by radioactive bugs for an 
hour to get the level of exposure equal to a dental X-ray, said Mike 
Berriochoa, spokesman for Fluor Daniel Hanford. And the house-size 
ants of ``Them!'' are ``physical impossibilities'' and just the stuff 
of science fiction, Zack said. Zack and Berriochoa said they are not 
aware of any pattern of genetic mutation in the insects around Hanford. 
And if the insects were to develop mutations, the abnormalities would 
be along the lines of a short antenna or an extra leg, Zack said. 
And because the insects' range is short _ for fruit flies, it's a 
few hundred yards (meters) to a half-mile (kilometer) _ the chances 
of their leaving the 560-square-mile (1,450-square-kilometer) complex 
are slim, he said. Hanford said radioactive pests are to be expected 
at a place that produced 40 years' worth of plutonium for nuclear 
weapons, including the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945. With 
all manner of burrowing creatures in the desert, including mice, rabbits 
and snakes, there's always the potential something will get contaminated, 
Berriochoa said. When contaminated mouse or rabbit droppings are found 
at Hanford, traps are set for the animal, and it is destroyed. Hanford 
stopped producing plutonium in the 1980s, but some areas remain highly 
radioactive. Billions of dollars are being spent to clean up the site 
along the Columbia River. Julie Petersen, 22, who works at Sunburst 
Video in Richland, does not spend a lot of time worrying about mutant 
bugs. ``I'm sure I get more radioactivity from my microwave,'' said 
Ms. Petersen, whose friends outside the area still ask her if she 
glows. ``It's just something we deal with every day. It's the way 
most people live.''
