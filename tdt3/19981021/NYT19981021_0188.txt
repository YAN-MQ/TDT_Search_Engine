The path from technological miracle to public nuisance is often a 
direct one. Witness the descent of the laser, the pure, steady light 
that can cut diamonds or could, in theory, carry all the world's electronic 
information simultaneously on a single beam. The laser has found its 
lowest-common-denominator use in the form of the pointer, the favorite 
tool of deadly dull meeting presenters. More recently, these devices, 
some of which can project little red dots 800 yards or more, have 
become the newest playthings of mischievous teen-agers. So routine 
have sightings of laser dots become on, for example, movie-theater 
screens, that a friend in San Francisco has a term for the phenomenon. 
She calls it ``high-tech graffiti.'' Reports of dotting incidents 
began to proliferate early this year, after Chinese and Taiwanese 
manufacturers of the devices dropped their prices, and models that 
retailed for $10 or less flooded the American market. Dotting is regarded 
by the police as a threatening act because many guns use a laser-pointing 
device for aiming. A red dot could conceivably be followed by a bullet. 
By mid-August, the New York City police had reported nearly 100 incidents 
of officers being dotted. A sideshow juggler in Virginia Beach, Va., 
and a roller-coaster operator at Hershey Park in Hershey, Pa., have 
also been victims of laser harassment. The fad is not just for teen-agers. 
The Skymall catalog stuffed in the seat pockets of 17 major airlines 
has, since January, featured a two-page spread of laser pointers: 
``Don't make a presentation without the Ultimate Presentation Power 
Tool.'' Some, like the $69.99 Infiniter 800, an ``ergonomically designed'' 
silvery-metal pod ``as beautiful as it is unusual,'' are clearly intended 
for a sophisticated clientele. While laser pointers are a familiar 
sight at meetings and conferences, none of the corporate consultants 
with whom I spoke, all of whom constantly make or attend business 
presentations, say they would ever think of using one. Indeed, there 
appears to be a stigma attached. ``I have never used a laser pointer 
in one of my presentations,'' said Watts Wacker, a Westport, Conn., 
futurist whose children gave him one for Father's Day. ``When someone 
does use one, I tend to brace myself for an overwhelmingly boring 
and hard-to-follow presentation.'' Larry Keeley, the president of 
the Doblin Group, a Chicago-based firm that dispenses advice on design 
strategy, concurs. ``An interesting and odd little medium, isn't it,'' 
he observed. ``I pretty much hate them. No one can hold them steadily, 
so they don't quiver. They enhance the sense that the world is a frenetic 
place.'' Keeley, however, remembers attending a conference on medical-communications 
technology in May where one of the speakers, a representative from 
Boston Scientific, handed out laser pointers to the audience. Attendees 
began projecting dots and symbols onto the stage and the speakers, 
leading to an unsuccessful attempt by the conference moderator to 
banish the devices. ``Everyone went juvenile,'' confirmed David Sume, 
one of the conference organizers. Wacker has also gone juvenile with 
his pointer. He confesses to dotting flight attendants as they demonstrate 
the oxygen mask. ``Perhaps the only time I have seen road warriors 
pay attention to a safety demonstration on an airplane,'' he noted. 
Manufactured in Asia, most laser pointers are designed there as well. 
One of the rare laser-pointer designers working in America is Juergen 
Coste, an engineer, and the president of Alpec, in Livermore, Calif. 
Among the dozens of models Alpec sells is one shaped like a 50-caliber 
bullet. It comes in a gift case and can be inscribed with slogans 
like ``Make My Day'' or ``Hasta la Vista, Baby.'' Coste denounces 
the practices of his competitors, whom he accuses of shoddy workmanship, 
selling cheap pointers with regulators that may not keep the power 
of the laser in check. The more powerful the beam, the greater its 
capacity to blind. ``Is it not scary?'' he asked. The scariest story 
Coste tells, however, is not about lasers that can blind, but about 
a special order his company recently did for Coca-Cola _ a pointer 
that projects no mere dot but a Coke bottle and a Coke logo. In other 
words, advertising. While executives who use laser pointers are stigmatized 
as nerds, and teen-agers who point them at police officers can be 
arrested, the advertising industry is waking up to the potential of 
these devices. If you think getting dotted is disturbing, just wait 
until you've been logoed.
