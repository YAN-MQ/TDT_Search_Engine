U.S. military leaders are warning service members not to publicly 
criticize President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Pentagon 
officials say when Americans volunteer for the military, they give 
up some of their free speech and other rights. VOA's Jim Randal reports 
from the Pentagon. Top officers from several branches of the military 
have recently issued reminders that military law bars officers from 
uttering contemptuous words about civilian leaders. Enlisted men and 
women face similar restrictions and penalties can include fines or 
dismissal. The rules allow expressions of opinion in private settings. 
The warnings follow several recent public criticisms of the president. 
In one case, a Marine major describes Mr. Clinton as "an adulterous 
liar and a criminal" in Monday's privately owned Navy Times newspaper. 
The House of Representatives has approved an impeachment inquiry of 
Mr. Clinton to investigate whether he lied under oath and obstructed 
justice to conceal an affair with Monica Lewinsky. Pentagon spokesman 
Ken Bacon says the ban on public criticism of the president by members 
of the military helps preserve civilian control of the armed services. 
We have an all-volunteer military. People know what the rules are 
when they join the military. The military has specific rules that 
are set up to protect good order and discipline. Mr. Bacon says the 
Marines are considering how to punish the outspoken major who wrote 
the critical column in the Navy Times newspaper. A Marine officer 
says the major will likely be counseled to avoid such public comment 
in the future. Jim Randal, VOA NEWS at the Pentagon.
