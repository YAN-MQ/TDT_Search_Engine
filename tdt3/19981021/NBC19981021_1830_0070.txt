Good evening. It's all your money. A half trillion dollars and tonight 
it is committed to some projects that no one knows where it is going. 
It is the federal budget, pass nd a rush and now signed and sealed. 
In Washington tonight no fanfare no ceremony, just a photographer. 
As President Clinton signed the federal budget into law. The $520 
billion package left the government with a $50 billion surplus, the 
first in three decades. It includes more than $1 billion to hire 100,000 
teachers, $9 billion in so-called emergency defense spending. $6 billion 
in aid for farmers and $18 billion for the international monetary 
fund to help prop up the world's economies. This budget is 4,000 pages 
long, weighs 40 pounds and is 16 inches thick. And almost no one knows 
much about the details at this point. So much money, so many pet projects, 
so many political opportunities -- is this any way to run a government? 
NBC's Gwen Ifill tonight. $520 billion Congress and the president 
enacted a budget Bill that breaks the one promise all said they would 
keep, protecting the budget surplus for social security. We don't 
save social security. We don't paydown the debt. We don't return to 
taxpayers a little of their hard-earned money but they can sfend a 
little more on pork. That is special projects added for lawyer makers99 
makers. On this trucking Bill, they found themselves out in the cold. 
Can you imagine a family in a windstar with four kids coming back 
from disney on route 95, and you got a truck, a defective truck, bearing 
down with regard to them? Can you imagine that? But can you imagine 
wolf's surprise when his own party leaders betrayed him during the 
final hours of frantic horse trading over the federal budget. All 
because the American trucking association objected. There is no evidence 
that suggests that the fatal accident rate for heavy trucks is on 
the rise. Wolf's measure was one of dozens of items added or deleted 
at the last minute from a 40-pound, 4,000-page package of spending 
measures. No member of Congress should be able to sleep with themselves 
they have no i'd what is in here. Arkansas congressman Jay Dickey 
owns a vacation home there. Dickey originally wanted $3 million for 
sand to restore the beach. He later backed down, but the budget still 
calls for a study of the beach problem. No one admits putting it there. 
Then there's $300 million worth of roads, fisheries and grasshopper 
research snagged by Alaska senator Ted Stevens. He happens to chair 
the budget-writing committee. Do I know what is in the Bill? Are you 
kidding? no. There is really no shame in these things. Most lawmakers 
immediately put out press releases boosting of the things they got. 
In an election year, bringing home this kind of bacon works. Gwen 
Ifill, NBC news, the capitol.
