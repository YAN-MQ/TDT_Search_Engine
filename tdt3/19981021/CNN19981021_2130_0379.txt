Researchers with the prevention research center in Berkeley, California, 
say television commercials contribute greatly to teenage drinking. 
A 12-year study shows children who watch beer commercials that feature 
animated characters and celebrities are more likely to drink more 
alcohol more frequently when they get older. Part of the study showed 
70% of fifth and sixth graders recognized an obscure segment of a 
budweiser beer commercial, which feature these three frogs. 65% of 
the children recognized part of a Coors beer commercial. Only 5% could 
identify a public service announcement against alcoholism.
