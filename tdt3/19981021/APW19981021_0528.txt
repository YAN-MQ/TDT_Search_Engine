Japan signed an agreement Wednesday to resume payments for a project 
to build nuclear reactors in North Korea, the Foreign Ministry said. 
Japan froze its dlrs 1 billion contribution to the Korean Peninsula 
Energy Development Organization after North Korea fired a rocket over 
Japan on Aug. 31. Tokyo says the launch was a ballistic missile test, 
while North Korea claims it put a satellite into orbit. Nonetheless, 
the firing caused alarm in Tokyo by demonstrating the communist country's 
ability to strike any part of Japan. Chief government spokesman Hiromu 
Nonaka announced the decision to resume funding, saying the KEDO project 
is the best way to keep North Korea from developing its own nuclear 
weapons. Terusuke Terada, Japan's ambassador to KEDO, signed the resolution 
on funding for the consortium in Tokyo, said a Foreign Ministry official 
who asked not to be identified by name. Members of the organization 
_ Japan, South Korea, the United States and the European Union _ had 
been scheduled to adopt a resolution on funding of the dlrs 4.6 billion 
project in August before the rocket launch prompted Japan to freeze 
its contribution. The KEDO consortium was formed under a 1994 agreement 
in which North Korea promised to halt its own nuclear program, suspected 
of developing weapons, in exchange for two Western-built light-water 
civilian reactors and fuel-oil shipments.
