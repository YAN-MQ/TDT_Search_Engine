President Joseph Estrada will not apologize to Malaysia for his criticisms 
of the treatment of that nation's ousted deputy prime minister, an 
official said Wednesday. Malaysian protesters demonstrated in front 
of the Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur Tuesday, demanding that 
Estrada apologize for allegedly meddling in their country's domestic 
affairs. Asked if the Philippine leader was considering an apology, 
presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said, ``The president had already 
said his piece. There is nothing more that needs to be explained.'' 
Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie have both spoken out 
against the arrest and treatment in jail of former Deputy Prime Minister 
Anwar Ibrahim. Estrada has described Anwar as a personal friend. Mahathir 
fired Anwar, 51, as deputy prime minister on Sept. 2 after the two 
differed on economic policy. Anwar began rallying opposition to Mahathir 
and was arrested Sept. 20. He appeared at court hearings with a black 
eye, bruises and a neck brace, saying he was beaten in police custody. 
Anwar has been charged with sexual misconduct and corruption, but 
has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated. Estrada 
initially said he was considering boycotting a summit in Malaysia 
next month of leaders of countries belonging to the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum to protest Anwar's treatment. He later announced 
he would attend. Estrada said Tuesday he has decided to reduce his 
criticism of Malaysia on the advice of his predecessor, Fidel Ramos. 
``I have to follow the advice of the president, to go slow, and we 
have to be friendly with Malaysia,'' Estrada said. ``I've expressed 
my feelings and that's enough.'' Malaysia also clarified that it postponed 
a defense meeting with the Philippines scheduled this month because 
of financial and time constraints and not because of the rift over 
Anwar, Barican said. Malaysia's defense ministry has reset the meeting 
in the Philippines to Nov. 8-10, Barican said. A serious rift between 
Malaysia and the Philippines, both founding members of the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations, could destroy harmony in the grouping 
at a time when it is trying to work cohesively to overcome Asia's 
financial turmoil. Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos also work in 
Malaysia, which is an important trading partner of the Philippines. 
Estrada, however, stressed he would continue advocating that Anwar 
be accorded due process of law and be treated humanely. ``I'm not 
wavering in my position that the former deputy prime minister should 
be given due process,'' Estrada told reporters.
