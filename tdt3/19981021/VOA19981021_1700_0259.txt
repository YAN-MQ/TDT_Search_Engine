Robin Cook has concluded a visit to Macedonia, a strategic player 
in ending the Kosovo crisis. During his two-day visit, Mr. Cook met 
with Macedonian leaders and Kosovo's chief negotiator. Jennifer Glass 
reports from the Macedonian capital, Skopje. Foreign Secretary Cook 
thanked Macedonian leaders for their cooperation in trying to end 
the Kosovo crisis. Macedonia is allowing NATO planes access to its 
air space and is permitting its personnel to be based within the country. 
Talking with reporters along the Macedonia-Kosovo border, Mr. Cook 
repeated earlier warnings that both the Serbian forces and Kosovo 
Albanians have to honor the U.S.-brokered cease-fire. Mr. Cook also 
met Wednesday in Skopje with Kosovo's chief negotiator, reassuring 
him that the international community will continue to pressure Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to carry out his promise to withdraw 
Serbian troops from Kosovo. But Mr. Cook also ruled out negotiating 
with the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army on determining 
the future of the province. Jennifer Glass for VOA NEWS, Skopje.
