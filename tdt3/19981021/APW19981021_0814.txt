French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who was in a coma 
for a week due to an allergic reaction to anesthesia, says his brush 
with death ``could have happened to anyone.'' ``What happened to me 
... was as unpredictable as an auto accident,'' Chevenement told Paris 
Match magazine in his first interview since the Sept. 2 operation. 
The 59-year-old Chevenement's heart stopped after he was administered 
curare, a muscle relaxant known to cause allergic reactions in some 
patients. He was set to undergo gall bladder surgery. ``Certain people 
are susceptible to (allergic) reactions, generally less violent than 
mine, but just as unforeseeable,'' he said. Now, nearly two months 
after his heart attack, Chevenement has re-read ``War and Peace'' 
and ``Don Quixote,'' he said. He takes walks in the garden at Val-de-Grace 
military hospital. He is expected to be released this week and to 
take up his duties again by the end of the year. Asked if politicians 
should be required to disclose details about their health to the public, 
Chevenement said he didn't think so. ``If a politician's illness handicaps 
his performance, he must suffer the consequences,'' Chevenement said. 
``It's a question of conscience, for which no hard and fast rule can 
substitute.'' Chevenement, a key figure in the French Cabinet, has 
held several ministry portfolios, including industry, education and 
defense. He resigned as defense minister in 1991 to protest France's 
involvement in the Gulf War. As interior minister, he is responsible 
for the nation's police and security forces.
