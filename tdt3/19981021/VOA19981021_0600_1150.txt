Fourth-seeded Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov has advanced to the second 
round of the Czech Indoor Tennis Tournament. But the news was not 
as good for other seeds. Kafelnikov beat Australia's Richard Fromberg 
7-6 and 6-3 on Tuesday to advance, but fifth-seeded Goren Evanisovich 
of Croatia was ousted 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 by Slovakia's Ian Croslak, and 
number six, Mark Philip Hoosis of Australia fell to David Prinicil 
of Germany 6-3, 6-7 and 6-3.
