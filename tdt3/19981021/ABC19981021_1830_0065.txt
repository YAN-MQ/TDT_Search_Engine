Good evening. If only Flowers made a real difference. In Maryland 
today, at the U.S. sponsored negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, 
the Yasser Arafat sent the prime minister Flowers to celebrate his 
birthday. At just about the same time, the Israelis were threatening 
to go home. It's been that kind of a week. And the United States may 
be now getting itself more deeply involved with security between Israelis 
and Palestinians than it ever has kbr. We'll start with what looks 
like serious gamesmanship. Prime minister Netanyahu of Israel has 
issued a statement saying he's going to leave the United States at 
10:00 tonight, eastern time if there isn't sufficient progress. In 
response to that, the president's spokesman said that was an ultimatum 
that was unfortunate, that the president believes there is still a 
basis to proceed. The hope here is that all of this is last-minute 
maneuvering. But administration officials say they can't be sure. 
At the wye plantation on Maryland's eastern shore, Israeli prime minister, 
netanyahu put out the word that he and his delegation were going to 
leave because the security agreement, drafted by the United States, 
was inadequate. So was this the end, state department spokesman Jamie 
Rubin was asked. We are at a critical moment, a moment of intensity 
and importance. But we can't hold people here against their will and 
we can't make them make the tough choices. The Palestinian delegation 
was quick to claim the high ground as against the Israelis. We've 
said, yes, for the proposals for President Clinton. The threat of 
walkout is being explained by us as political blackmail. When President 
Clinton presented a final draft to the U.S. security plan to prime 
minister Netanyahu in a meeting that lasted until after 1:00 this 
morning, the Israelis did raise new objections to the security plan. 
According to administration officials who cautioned they were not 
charging bad faith. And the president said this afternoon said he 
has been making the argument to the Middle East leaders that -- The 
only victories that have lasting impact are not the victories over 
other people but victories for our common humanity. We will know within 
hours, perhaps, whether this will succeed or fail. Thank you, Sam, 
Sam Donaldson at the White House.
