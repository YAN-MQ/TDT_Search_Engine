Steven Spielberg isn't going totally dvd crazy. "The Hollywood reporter" 
trade paper indicates the filmmaker is releasing ten films he directed 
and/or produced to the new digital format, including the "back to 
the future" trilogy, "1941" and "the flintstones." "E.T.: the extra-terrestrial" 
and "jurassic park" are still being held back.
