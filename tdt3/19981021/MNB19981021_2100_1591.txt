In Texas, the rain has stopped, but a lot of the state is still underwater 
tonight. Evacuations are continuing southeast of Houston, mostly, 
as waters from the swollen Colorado river creeps closer to homes, 
the river is forecast to crest tomorrow evening, 11 feet above flood 
stage. At least 22 people are confirmed dead now, another five missing.
