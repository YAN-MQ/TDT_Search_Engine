When we come back -- Sammy Sosa goes home to help. Party of the first 
part did not intend-- I shoulda used preparation H. if you had, you 
wouldn't be suffering now. Preparation H helps stop itch and further 
irritation... with a soothing layer of protection. I shoulda used 
preparation H. I'm 64. Is there anything I can do to stop bone loss? 
Absolutely. Here's proof. In a landmark clinical study, caltrate actually 
stopped bone loss... in women at risk for osteoporosis. Whatever your 
age: " I've just got this burning love for food. But sometimes it 
just doesn't love me back. Heartburn surging up to here. What my doctor 
calls acid reflux. When I get it, he says get gaviscon. Only regular 
gaviscon forms a soothing, protective barrier to help keep stomach 
acid down -- where it belongs. Mylanta can't -- pepcid ac can't. Only 
gaviscon can. So my heartburn doesn't come back to burn me. It helps 
keep acid down where it be longs.
