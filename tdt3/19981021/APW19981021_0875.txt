The Ariane 5 rocket, the most powerful in the European series of unmanned 
rockets, made its third and final test launch Wednesday, sailing without 
a hitch into the heavens above South America. The lift off from its 
space base in Kourou, French Guiana, on the northern shoulder of South 
America, came at 13:37 p.m. local time (1637 GMT). It was well within 
the launch window despite a half-hour halt in the countdown. Flight 
503 was carrying a mockup of Eutelsat's W2 satellite, weighing 2.6 
tons, and a capsule with instruments to measure various functions. 
The capsule was to fall later into the Pacific Ocean for recovery. 
One of the goals of the launch is to confirm Ariane 5's capacity to 
place satellites into orbit. European officials had been holding their 
breath for the launch. The first Ariane 5 crashed in June 1996 and 
a launch a year ago was less-than-perfect. Wednesday's final test 
launch was critical. Officials see the Ariane 5 as a vehicle to boost 
Europe's commercial space launch industry even further along its success 
route. The Ariane 5 has twice the power and payload capacity of the 
Ariane 4, and should double launch capacity for Arianespace, the commercial 
arm of the European Space Agency. Trouble with the Ariane 5 forced 
officials to switch a Eutelsat satellite to an Ariane 4, ESA officials 
said in June. In February, Arianespace admitted that the rocket experienced 
a spin problem on its test launch last Oct. 30. Arianespace dominates 
the world's commercial launch market, competing with U.S., Russian 
and Chinese firms.
