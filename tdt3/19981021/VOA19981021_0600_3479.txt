Entertainer Jimmy Buffet says he hopes to work out a settlement with 
the owners of some restaurants in Hawaii called "Cheeseburger in Paradise." 
See, "Cheeseburger in Paradise" is also the name of a song by Jimmy 
Buffet. He filed a lawsuit last year claiming that the restaurant 
owners needed his permission to use the song title. The restaurant 
owners claimed that they had a trademark on that name. A federal judge 
had already ruled against the claim, but the judge did not rule out 
letting them continue to use or call their restaurants the Cheeseburger 
in Paradise. Buffet and officials of the restaurant company say they 
hope some agreement can be reached. Let's hope so. Yeah.
