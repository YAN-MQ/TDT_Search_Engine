You're listening to THE WORLD. Remember, you can join us anytime online 
at www.theworld.org. This is PRI, Public Radio International. This 
is public radio, 91 FM. I encourage you to go to your telephone now 
in this very short pledge break and make a membership pledge of support 
to 91 FM, public radio. Your membership dollars make the difference 
to 91 FM. We exist because listeners like you make pledges and provide 
the money that it takes to put the program on the air. The number 
to call to make a pledge is 215-923-1234. That's 923-1234. I'm Lisa 
Mullins. Still to come on THE WORLD, Chile's president flies home 
to a changed country, as the political fallout continues from Augusto 
Pinochet's arrest. Also, the roots of Africa in Jamaica. And the roots 
of world music in classic jazz. What they call today world music were 
played in the late '60s. First, this news.
