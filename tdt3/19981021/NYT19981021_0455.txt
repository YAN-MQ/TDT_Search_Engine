When you are playing as well as Mark O'Meara, jet lag is not a problem. 
Fresh off his victory over Tiger Woods at the world match play championship 
in England on Sunday, O'Meara has returned home, ready to tee it up 
again at the National Car Rental Golf Classic, which begins Thursday 
at the Walt Disney World Resort. The tournament is being held about 
20 minutes from O'Meara's house, which makes it convenient. It has 
a strong field that includes the defending champion David Duval, Woods, 
Vijay Singh, Davis Love III and Phil Mickelson. It is the final full-field 
event of the regular PGA Tour season, with players near the 125th 
position on the money list fighting to keep their playing privileges 
for next year. By winning both the Masters and the British Open this 
year, O'Meara has already clinched player of the year honors in the 
eyes of many. However, O'Meara isn't so sure. Duval has won four times, 
he leads the Tour's money list, and if Duval were to win this week 
or next week's Tour Championship, he would gain increased support 
among his peers, who vote for the award. Yet, regardless of what happens 
during the next two weeks, O'Meara has nothing to prove. He has delivered 
under pressure, and at age 41, O'Meara has played his best golf at 
an age when many golfers begin to fade. So while O'Meara would love 
to win player of the year, or the money title, he will approach the 
next two weeks the way he has approached the entire year. He will 
try to play well enough in the early rounds to give himself a chance. 
Then if O'Meara is in contention on Sunday afternoon, watch out. ``My 
goal at the beginning of the year was to play well, try to win some 
tournaments, finish hopefully in the top 10 of the money list,'' said 
O'Meara, who has earned more than $1.68 million on tour this season. 
``Because of my performance in major championships and because of 
majors having a lot of notoriety, media throughout the world watching, 
that in itself has created more notoriety. ``If you ask me, there 
have been years I actually hit the ball better than I did this year. 
If you look at the statistical information, I'm not the best in driving 
accuracy, I'm not the best in driving distance. My stats are somewhat 
mediocre, but my scoring average on Sunday is No. 1. And when I've 
had chances to win, I've usually gotten the job done.'' Sunday was 
another example, when O'Meara rallied from an early deficit to defeat 
Woods, 1-up, in a 36-hole match play classic. O'Meara and Woods are 
neighbors and close friends, but that relationship is forgotten during 
competition. From the moment O'Meara stepped to the first tee, he 
could sense the tension. ``When we teed off Sunday morning, he wasn't 
really in a chatty mood,'' O'Meara said of Woods. ``He wanted to drill 
me, let's face it. I was four down after five holes. I'm thinking, 
`I hope I don't get absolutely whacked here.''' A few holes later, 
Woods engaged in some gamesmanship with O'Meara by refusing to concede 
an 18-inch putt. ``I thought when I walked up, he was just going to 
say, `Oh, that's good,''' O Meara said. ``He didn't. I said: `You 
kidding me? This is good, right? You give me this all the time at 
home.' ``I said, `OK, fine, I understand how we stand now. I thought 
we were friends, but obviously you don't think I can handle a little 
1-foot putt straight in.' So I made it, and I said to him, `That's 
it, from now on, I'm not giving you anything, either.''' Woods was 
still 3-up after 18 holes, but O'Meara showed his resolve by coming 
back to win, making birdies on the final two holes. ``It was nerve-racking,'' 
O'Meara said. ``I hit bad shots. He hit bad shots. He made the big 
mistake, the three-putt on No. 16, and fortunately I was able to close 
with two birdies.'' It remains to be seen if O'Meara and Woods will 
have another back-nine battle this weekend. But O'Meara would love 
to cap his most satisfying year with another victory.
