When Carlos Hernandez crossed the border Tuesday he brought his family, 
his barbecue and seven mariachis to tailgate in the parking lot of 
Qualcomm Stadium. Having spent $4,000 on tickets to Game 3 of the 
World Series Tuesday night, Hernandez, an electrical engineer in Tijuana, 
said he didn't have enough tickets for his wife and father. That's 
why he brought the band _ to entertain them in the parking lot during 
the game. ``I like all the Saturdays and Sundays,'' Hernandez said. 
``When I come to be with my team. I am a baseball manager for three 
Little League teams and I bring them with me to enjoy the games. We 
come on the bus or we drive. On the bus, we pack our lunch. When we 
drive, it is expensive for a Mexican to come to the ballgame with 
food and parking and beverage.'' Hernandez participates in the Domingos 
Padres Tecate program that the Padres established in 1996. It is a 
Sunday at the ballpark for thousands of Mexican fans who pay $11 a 
ticket to have a bus ride, a seat at the stadium, and a quick exit 
through a special lane at the U.S. Border Inspection Station, one 
of the busiest border crossings in the world. Tuesday, Hernandez and 
thousands of other Mexican fans came in cars or crossed the border 
and took the trolley to the stadium. The Padres estimate that on any 
game day during the regular season, 7,000 to 8,000 fans _ roughly 
23 percent _ are Hispanic, either from San Diego or the Mexican states 
of Baja California or Sonora. Padres officials use a polling system 
to come up with a sampling of the diversity of their fans. On Sundays, 
close to 1,000 fans participate in the Domingos program. More than 
2,000 tickets were sold for the World Series game in the Padres Tienda 
de Beisbol store in Tijuana. Hundreds of fans were turned away and 
a handmade sign indicated that all the tickets had been sold. ``I 
think we could have sold easily 10,000,'' said 27-year-old Walter 
Manjarrez, the store manager. ``The fans here just want what the players 
are wearing and they're willing to buy anything we have. We can't 
keep stock of any hat that has ``SD'' on it _ especially the official 
player hat. ``And the World Series, well, the citizens here feel the 
Padres are their home club. Tony Gwynn came here to do an autograph 
signing and thousands showed up. I sold our last shirts from our display. 
And this won't stop until after Christmas, whether they win or lose. 
They are Padrisimo _ the coolest team.'' Enrique Morones was the first 
to convince the Padres' owner, John Moores, and the club president, 
Larry Lucchino, that the biggest untapped market was their neighbor 
to the south. A million and a half people live in Tijuana, which is 
30 minutes from downtown San Diego, and is the biggest city in Baja 
and one of the biggest in Mexico. ``Before the Padres belonged to 
San Diego,'' said Morones, the director of Hispanic-multicultural 
marketing for the Padres. ``They were the neighbor's team. Now the 
Padres are Tijuana's team. In a philosophical sense, John Moores and 
Larry Lucchino have made a bridge and eliminated the border. On game 
days, the border guards make it a smooth transition for fans to show 
their documents and come across. Baseball has no borders.'' Mayor 
Jose Osuna Millan is considered the common person's mayor in Tijuana. 
He has been a Padre fan since the organization joined the major leagues 
and has been known to hand out Padres hats to city street workers. 
At his office near the border, Millan, who is often at the Padres 
games, said he and his assistants were closing up the city's business 
early to attend Game 3. Millan will be in attendance at Tuesday's 
game with the governors from Baja California, south and north. ``This 
is the el equipo de casa,'' said Millan, who has thrown out a pitch 
at a Padres game. ``The team of the house. The Padres are our passion, 
they are our team. I love Greg Vaughn and Ken Caminiti like many of 
our fans. We have the best economic situation in Mexico. Even though 
the peso is weak, Tijuana is healthy. We have less than 1 percent 
unemployment. If we had a parade for the Padres after the Series, 
more than 100,000 people would line our streets. More than a politician 
can get.'' Lorana Padilla, 31, is a bookmaker at the Caliente Thoroughbred 
Club in Tijuana. She came to the World Series with 20 other bookmakers 
and spent thousands on tickets. While she admits to having a crush 
on Caminiti and spends most of her time at the game with her eyes 
glued on third base, Padilla said the Padres as a team were a big 
priority with Tijuana residents. ``They are our home team,'' said 
Padilla, through a translator. ``It is easy to feel that San Diego 
is a part of Tijuana. We feel together. We don't have a major league 
team in Tijuana, so the Padres are it for us. We say yes for this 
team. We say keep the faith.''
