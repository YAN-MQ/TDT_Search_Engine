Nobody loves cars more than I do. Each one is a work of art. So when 
a maker of all these chose a new antifreeze, it got my attention. 
General Motors now uses the dex-cool technology of havoline extended 
life antifreeze in virtually all its new vehicles. The same patented 
formula you can use in your car. For 5 years or 150,000 miles. So 
do what GM did, switch to havoline. I use it in my car. I only wish 
this were it. Right now you can get... a complete pair of great-looking 
glasses... for only $99 at Lenscrafters... in your choice of hundreds 
of the latest frame styles. Lenscrafters $99 complete pair sale. This 
is a great offer. People should definitely not miss this.
