British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday again ruled out 
negotiations with the Kosovo Liberation Army to establish peace in 
the wartorn province. But he also renewed a warning to Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic that he is under close scrutiny to comply with 
the terms of a deal he signed with NATO. The Western alliance's deadline 
for him to pull his forces out of Kosovo or face airstrikes ends Oct.27. 
Earlier Wednesday, Milosevic said he remains commmitteed to the Kosovo 
peace agreement despite what he called ``terrorist'' attempts to sabotage 
it, a reference to recent KLA hit-and-run attacks on Serb forces. 
In an interview with Cable News Network, Cook said, ``It is very important 
that we have the cease-fire observed (in Kosovo) on both sides, and 
that means (also) the Kosovo Liberation Army, and we have already 
taken action through the U.N. to call on all members to deny funds 
and arms to the Kosovo Liberation Army to try to contain the danger 
of hostilities and injury.'' The head of British diplomacy was interviewed 
while in Skopje, capital of Montenegro, the second stop on his tour 
of Balkan countries. Cook said it was very important for the international 
community ``that we maintain our negotiations with the political, 
democratic, legitimate leadership of the Kosovo people,'' adding that 
``we cannot get into negotiating a separate track with people who 
have the guns.'' The West considers Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic 
Albanian leader, and his negotatiating team the legitimage representatives 
of the Kosovo Albanians, who account for some 90 percent of the two 
million people of the troubled Serbian province. However, a 1991 referendum 
in which a vast majority voted for independence was never recognized 
by either Serbia or anyone else. Cook was insistent in the CNN interview'': 
``Let's be clear. what we want to see emerge from the crisis is a 
stable democratic Kosovo being run by elected politicians, not by 
the commander of any army.'' Earlier in Skopje, Cook told reporters 
the international community ``will be watching very carefully to make 
sure'' that Milosevic sticks to the agreement'' under which he has 
to pull out his troops from Kosovo and allow the return of up to 300,000 
refugees. U.S. and NATO officials complain that Milosevic has still 
not withdrawn all the special police units sent to Kosovo in February 
when he attacked ethnic Albanian separatists.
