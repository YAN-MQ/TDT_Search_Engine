It would just be a pleasure to send it to you as it is a pleasure 
to get your call now at 215-932-1234. Thanks very much for you pledges. 
You're listening to 91 FM, WHYY FM Philadelphia, your member supported 
NPR station serving Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. There's 
another pledge, thanks very much, at 215-923-1234. Just about 30 seconds 
left in "Fresh Air" with Terry Gross, and then coming up next, it's 
news from National Public Radio, and then THE WORLD, with Lisa Mullins 
and Tony Kahn, that marvelous hour-long news magazine bringing you 
the news from a global perspective. So there's another reason to support 
public radio. After that, it's "Talk of the Nation" at. And then at 
10:00 tonight, we continue our series of programs focusing on Africans 
in America. Tonight, it's a very interesting documentary about the 
life of Paul Robeson. So stay tuned. All that still to come here on 
91 FM. Thanks again for your pledges. It's now 8:01.
