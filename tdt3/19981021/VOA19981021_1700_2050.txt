President Clinton's lawyers are criticizing the House Judiciary Committee's 
plans for its impeachment inquiry of Mr. Clinton. After meeting with 
Judiciary Committee aides Wednesday, White House Special Counsel Greg 
Craig said he believes the committee could move more rapidly. He also 
said there is no progress in defining the scope of the impeachment 
investigation. He was asked if President Clinton would testify before 
the committee. It is much too premature to consider that question. 
We still don't have the stage set, the rules understood. We're not 
yet convinced that this tribunal is operating by a fair, even-handed, 
impartial set of rules. And so we are not going to address that issue 
until we have greater certainty on the question of scope and on the 
question of what the constitutional standards are that this committee 
will apply to the question of impeachment. The House earlier this 
month approved an impeachment inquiry without limits on its time or 
scope. It is expected to focus on whether the president lied under 
oath or obstructed justice in trying to conceal an extramarital affair.
