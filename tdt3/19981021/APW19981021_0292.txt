The government Wednesday lifted a ban of several independent newspapers, 
a day after it imposed a law restricting their work. The move means 
that Danas, Dnevni Telegraf and Nasa Borba dailies, shut down last 
week, can publish, although some of the editors warned that the new 
law makes it impossible to work, B-92 radio reported. ``Whoever wants 
to keep one's journalistic integrity will have enormous problems,'' 
said Slavko Curuvija, editor of the banned Dnevni Telegraf daily. 
Curuvija called on his colleagues from other independent papers not 
to resume publishing, thus protesting the media law passed by the 
Serbian parliament on Tuesday. The lifting of the ban has to be published 
in the state official gazette before the papers can publish again. 
Serbia's autocratic government, loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, has used the possibility of NATO intervention on military 
targets to clamp down against opponents at home. The new information 
law bans broadcasts of Serbian-language programs by foreign media 
and calls for huge fines against media editors and owners who disobey 
the decree. It also gives broad powers to the authorities to determine 
which report is against the law, and places further restrictions on 
working permits for media organizations. Independent legal experts 
and journalists say the law is highly restrictive and again introduces 
censorship which was formally abandoned in Serbia in the late 1980s. 
The law superseded a decree imposing censorship in the media. The 
three papers were banned last week after the government said they 
had worked against the interests of the state. The government also 
evicted a popular Belgrade radio station from their premises and shut 
down a number of provincial media. Throughout the nearly eight-month-old 
Kosovo crisis, state officials have accused the media of betraying 
Serbia's national interests by reporting ethnic Albanian stands in 
the conflict or carrying foreign news reports about the fighting. 
A U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, on Tuesday expressed ``outrage'' 
at the media crackdown at a meeting with editors of Serbia's independent 
media.
