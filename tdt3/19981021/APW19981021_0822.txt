Parents could wind up back in school if their kids regularly skip 
class as part of a Dutch government plan to tackle youth crime. Parents 
of children who constantly play hooky can be fined under Dutch law. 
But with about 30,000 reports of truancy each year, the government 
is looking for a more effective solution. One suggestion is for court 
to ask parents to perform the equivalent of unpaid community service 
_ the Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad reported Wednesday, citing unidentified 
civil servants at the Justice Ministry. The classes for parents, being 
put together by education experts at Leiden University, would include 
lessons on how the school system works, keeping track of your child's 
timetable and a class called ``puberty psychology.'' Three Dutch cities 
plan to offer the courses on a voluntary basis to parents of truants. 
If the classes help to reduce truancy, they may be used as a form 
of sanction by the courts, the newspaper said.
