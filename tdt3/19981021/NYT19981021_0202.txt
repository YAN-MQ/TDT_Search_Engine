It was mom to mom: an actress with a 16-week-old baby, a reporter 
with a toddler. Is the baby sleeping well? How's she eating? ``I don't 
get caught up in the cliches of being a mother,'' snapped Sandra Bernhard, 
in bare feet, a B-movie A-line skirt and not an ounce of baby fat. 
Ms. Bernhard is back in town, taking her improvisational one-woman 
downtown show, ``I'm Still Here . . . Damn It!'' to Broadway (previews 
start Oct. 22 at the Booth Theater). Known for her scorching Sapphic 
wit and sailor's tongue, Ms. Bernhard, 43, has added material about 
bringing up baby _ solo _ and finding serenity in the cabala, the 
Jewish mystical tradition. Not that she has lost her edge. When Ms. 
Bernhard gets up at 5 in the morning, she's as likely to be heading 
for the Howard Stern show as bottle-feeding her baby, Cicely. ``I 
pumped for a while, but I never produced enough milk,'' said Ms. Bernhard, 
who had a Caesarean section on July 4. But on a recent morning when 
Cicely was in the park with her 19-year-old nanny, Ms. Bernhard turned 
down the volume, dropped the name-dropping (mostly) and dished about 
the same things new moms everywhere cope with: child care, baby-proofing, 
toy overload. Of course, her take on some of these quotidian matters 
might make a soccer mom spin in her Land Rover tracks. ``I like having 
a TV in the room, but I don't want to see a bunch of primary-colored 
kid's stuff'' was all she said about that that was free of vulgarity. 
An invasion of red, blue and yellow plastics is not imminent in the 
actress' elegantly appointed Greenwich Village studio apartment; the 
baby has her own one-room apartment upstairs that she shares with 
the nanny. As for the most frequently asked question _ Who's the father? 
_ it's a cliffhanger. Ms. Bernhard likes to answer according to mood. 
Recently, she cited John Paulk, the drag queen turned heterosexual 
who graced the cover of the Aug. 17 Newsweek, as the designated dad. 
(Her intimates know but won't tell, except to say that because of 
her interest in the cabala, he had to be Jewish.) Rearing a child 
alone is no joking matter, even for a comedian, and Ms. Bernhard said 
she would rely on her friends, among them Isaac Mizrahi, the fashion 
designer; Peggy Lipton, an actress; Patricia Velasquez, a model, and 
Steven Aturo, a make-up artist. ``A lot of people in my life are never 
going to have babies,'' she said. ``So I'm not too worried about who's 
going to help me.'' Ms. Bernhard's studio has the distinctive look 
of a seraglio for one: lots of bedding; piles of embroidered velvet 
and lace-trimmed pillows in dark, old master shades; a gigantic teak-framed 
mirror tilted against the wall. A baby-proofing nightmare? ``I don't 
think she's going to be the kind of baby who's going to be running 
around tearing things up,'' the actress said, perhaps optimistically. 
``She'll know better.'' Sure. And then there's the high-voltage lighting: 
enough chandeliers, high-tech ceiling fixtures, votive candles and 
twinkle lights for a stage set. ``Sandra has such a variety of moods,'' 
said Robert Verdi, her decorating muse and friend. Her primary home 
in Los Angeles, a 30s bungalow, is more playful, Verdi said, with 
kitchen cabinets painted in a powder blue and sea green plaid, and 
plates to match. Verdi decorated the baby and nanny's apartment with 
more flounce than edge, combining a crib carved with cherubs, Irish 
linen curtains and a collection of Teletubby dolls from Mizrahi. ``L.A. 
is luxurious but comfortable, a place where Sandra can scream at her 
friends when they've been bad,'' Verdi said, sitting on the couch 
beside Ms. Bernhard, somewhere between a companionable snuggle and 
a one-man support group. Verdi whispered with conspiratorial glee 
that people in the building who have seen him pushing the stroller 
seem to think he's the baby's father. He says he's not, but he sure 
knows his way around her bed, a queen-size, rumpus-room upheaval of 
coverlets, sheets and pillows. ``I'm thrilled when he comes over and 
remakes it for me,'' Ms. Bernhard said, adding with a glint of mischief, 
``I should take a picture and study it.'' Indeed, the intensely feminine 
mood turned a shade voyeuristic at the sight of the Polaroids on her 
coffee table showing Ms. Bernhard in an advanced state of pregnancy, 
nude in the shower. She carried well. Often the conversation degenerated 
into self-referential baby talk, with the pair mimicking Teletubbies 
and reciting the refrain in sing-song from the Cole Porter-Moss Hart 
tune about the ``Kling-Kling Bird on the Divi-Divi Tree.'' That is, 
when they weren't batting around material for her show. A murky photograph 
of a French chateau on the wall _ a gift from Karl Lagerfeld _ prompted 
Ms. Bernhard's ad-libbed, obscenity-studded impersonation of the fashion 
designer and his impenetrable French accent. ``I should put that in 
the show,'' she said, her own best fan. ``I love Karl, and I love 
his clothes, and as soon as he gives me some more, I'll wear them 
again.'' But in describing how a Los Angeles bookstore owner accosted 
her and offered to send her a monthly shipment of baby books, Ms. 
Bernhard wavered between parent and performer: ``How many books does 
a baby need? It's insane.'' But her indignity faded with the glimpse 
of opportunity. ``I could do a whole routine about it,'' she said, 
brightening. Ms. Bernhard described a ballad in the show about child-rearing. 
``It's a musical piece about raising your baby and, after all the 
work and money and love, having her run off with white trash,'' she 
said, upping the ante on a tale of disappointment any mother would 
recognize. Only once did the actress snap at her designer, when he 
did his own riff about her daughter. The subject was downtown parents 
dressing their babies in black. ``We were at this restaurant with 
Isaac, and he was holding Cicely up going, `I have no basics! I have 
no basics!''' Mr Verdi said in the voice of a fashion-plate baby. 
Ms. Bernhard interrupted Verdi mid-anecdote: ``I said that line,'' 
she said curtly. But in general, during the two-hour informal interview, 
Ms. Bernhard ``was golden,'' Verdi said, confiding later that she's 
not always so tolerant. She was even enthusiastic about this reporter's 
own wad of baby photographs. What an actress! Friends have attributed 
her recent calm both to Cicely and to her study of the cabala. The 
Hebrew alphabet could be seen posted on the refrigerator and propped 
in the baby's crib. ``I was always interested in Judaism, the beauty 
of the tradition, the repetitions in reading the Torah, but nothing 
backed it up until I discovered the cabala,'' said Ms. Bernhard, who 
grew up in Scottsdale, Ariz., with three older brothers in a Conservative 
Jewish family. After graduating from high school she worked on a kibbutz 
for eight months, before moving, at 18, to Los Angeles. ``Cabala planted 
the seeds that made it possible for me to change and have the composure 
to have a baby,'' she said. When she's not working, mother and daughter 
sleep together. Eventually, Ms. Bernhard hopes to buy a larger place 
and is waiting for the real-estate market to drop. Until then she 
will continue to rent. ``I would like to stay in New York most of 
the time,'' she said. ``It's great for a kid to be around a lot of 
ethnicities and not to be freaked out by everything. If you're here 
in the city, you have to learn how to live with all people. It's not 
even an issue. It's more like `Hey, that's cool.''' And with that, 
Ms. Bernhard stepped into her closet, slipped out of her tight skirt 
and into gray sweatpants and headed off for the playground, where 
she said all the other nannies treat her just like another mom on 
the go.
