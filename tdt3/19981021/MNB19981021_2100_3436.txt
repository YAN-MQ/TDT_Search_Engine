We want to pass along to you something that just happened this evening 
at the world series game going on in San Diego. We take you to the 
fourth inning, noblauch. Mark McGwire attending tonight as a spectator 
seated next to bud selig, who is commissioner these days at baseball. 
And the game played on. McGwire with another play, a great play. He 
gets to see some post-season action, even though his team did not.
