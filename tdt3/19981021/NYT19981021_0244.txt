Imagine for a moment that the reputations of U.S. presidents were 
like publicly traded companies. You and your broker would be dizzy 
following the peaks and valleys of your Clinton stock or you might 
still be kicking yourself for not shorting George Bush before the 
1992 election. Maybe a revisionist biography or two could juice those 
shares of Warren Harding that have long been dormant in your portfolio. 
But you couldn't go wrong buying Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln is a blue-chip 
performer, rising in value every year. And, in a sense, Lincoln's 
reputation does get traded regularly. Artifacts of Lincoln and his 
times are popular items on a variety of online auction sites. Earlier 
this month, Christie's (www.christies.com) auctioned an 1843 daguerrotype 
of a man who may or may not be The Railsplitter himself. Bidding peaked 
at $150,000, falling short of what the owners wanted for the purported 
earliest known Lincoln photo. (One expert estimated that if the owners 
eventually prove their claim, the item could fetch $2 million to $5 
million.) Kim Bauer, a historical research specialist with the Illinois 
State Historical Society in Springfield, said interest in Lincoln 
has always been strong, and periodically becomes intense. ``It's generally 
thought that Lincoln is the third most-chronicled person in history, 
behind Jesus Christ and Napoleon,'' Bauer said. Bauer oversees Illinois' 
huge Lincoln archives, which include some 1,500 manuscripts and 11,000 
books written by or about the 16th president, plus a huge assortment 
of movies, plays and various historical artifacts. The collection, 
whose centerpiece is the original Gettysburg Address, represents ground 
zero in the Land of Lincoln (though other archives reside at the Library 
of Congress and elsewhere). From a cluttered office and warren of 
storage rooms in the Old State Capitol Building in downtown Springfield, 
Bauer continues to buy Lincoln-related artifacts for the state. But 
he must be selective. ``The collection is getting too big for the 
space we have,'' he explained. Still, in his quest for more Lincoln 
memorabilia, Bauer expanded his searching to the Internet in 1996, 
bidding for many items on the EBay site (www.ebay.com). He ventured 
online in part to save the state money. EBay is an auction site, but 
buyers deal directly with sellers, eliminating the auction house's 
cut. The convenience factor was what really appealed to Bauer, who 
did not want to spend a lot of time traveling to auctions. ``The Net 
has allowed that flexibility, where I can sit here at the desk and 
still bid on what I want.'' All told, Bauer has purchased about 50 
pieces through EBay. Many can only be described as early 1900s curios: 
cigar wrappers and shoe-polish tins bearing Lincoln's likeness; a 
child's prayer card depicting Lincoln; a tobacco trading card noting 
his achievements. There is at least one gem, though. Bauer's first 
purchase on EBay netted, for $65, a ``stereo card'' depicting preparations 
for Lincoln's funeral in Washington. When looked at with a 19th-century 
stereo viewer, the image appears to be in 3-D. Bauer said that any 
stereo cards from that era were scarce, and those from the funeral 
rarer still. ``It's the best piece I found on EBay,'' he says, estimating 
that he could sell the same card today for about $250 _ though he 
never would. The state's collection is permanent. Treasures like the 
stereo card remain the exception, rather than the rule for online 
auctions. But the perception of electronic auctions as the world's 
largest garage sale is evolving. ``The Internet is going to allow 
much broader collecting,'' says David Redden, an executive vice president 
of Sotheby's. The Net, he believes, ``will create larger, better, 
bigger and more plentiful collections.'' As the interest in online 
trading grows, the likelihood of finding underpriced Lincoln treasures 
will diminish, some experts say. ``I cannot say that I have ever found 
a true bargain in the field of Lincolniana,'' says Doug Sanders, owner 
of McGowan Books (www.mcgowanbooks.com) in Chapel Hill, N.C., which 
specializes in Civil War-era pieces. Sanders has been selling collectibles 
through the store's own site for five years, and he also does business 
on EBay. ``The competition is fierce, preventing the acquisitions 
of bargains at auction.'' Bauer also said that he had been the victim 
of ``sniping,'' in which a nominal high bidder is picked off by an 
opportunistic rival as an auction's time limit is about to expire. 
It happened to him when he had been the high bidder on an 1860 election 
pamphlet throughout most of the proceedings. With a few minutes left 
for bidding, he had to leave his desk; when he returned, someone had 
outbid him by just $2.50, securing the pamphlet. Some disreputable 
dealers are simply looking to cheat people. Bauer says buyers should 
be especially wary of phony editions of The New York Herald newspaper 
from the day after Lincoln's assassination. ``People are paying $100 
to $200 for a facsimile that you could get for $1,'' Bauer says. ``You 
try and help these people by e-mailing them, but you just can't do 
it all.'' Fake Lincoln signatures also clutter the market. To protect 
the state from fraud, Bauer will not buy any purported Lincoln autograph 
_ online or otherwise _ without a money-back guarantee. For the most 
part, though, Bauer has been delighted with his EBay adventures. Once 
he was outbid on a Lincoln photo that sold for $260. Within 12 hours, 
two people e-mailed him, offering better images for less money. ``I 
don't mean to sound corny,'' he said, ``but dealing with some of these 
folks has really restored some of my faith in human nature.''
