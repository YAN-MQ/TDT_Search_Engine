I'm Imani Crosby, VOA NEWS. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are 
reportedly near agreement on a critical security issue at the Mideast 
summit talks outside Washington. Sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said Israel would no longer insist that suspected Palestinian 
terrorists be extradited to Israel. They said the U.S. Central Intelligence 
Agency would supervise the jailing of suspected Palestinian terrorists 
by the Palestinian Authority. The apparent agreement comes on the 
sixth days of talks, Tuesday, between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
