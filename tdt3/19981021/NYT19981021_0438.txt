Parents of the Upper West Side, beware. ``This Is Our Youth'' is back. 
For those who didn't see the play's original production in 1996, here 
is a synopsis: three young slackers, blessed with money, education 
and vocabulary, spend 24 hours lounging in a bleak West Side apartment, 
trafficking in cocaine, casual sex and enough confused philosophical 
banter to shame any college freshman. And according to the playwright, 
Kenneth Lonergan, almost every bit of it is true. ``It's essentially 
the life lived by my friends and me on the Upper West Side in the 
1980s,'' Lonergan said recently. ``I remember sitting in those rooms, 
stoned out of our minds, with our parents' money behind us and kind 
of levitating our way through life.'' The dark comedy was popular 
with young theatergoers in its first incarnation, an audience that 
its producers are hoping to attract with an eight-week run of the 
latest production, now in previews at Second Stage and opening on 
Nov. 3. It has been almost two years since the play, directed then 
as now by Mark Brokaw, received very favorable reviews for a brief 
production by the New Group at the Intar Theater on Theater Row. Ben 
Brantley, writing in The New York Times, called it ``an eloquently 
inarticulate take on the slacker generation'' that ``deserves a longer 
life''; John Simon, in New York magazine, said the play and production 
``come together in a perfect, gemlike whole.'' But though the movie 
rights were quickly sold, the rest was misery. The Broadway producers 
Barry and Fran Weissler bought the theatrical rights but could not 
find a larger available theater. Plans for a run in the spring of 
1997 were delayed to the fall, and then to the spring of 1998. The 
play's plight became the target of jokes. ``If they'd had to wait 
any longer for a theater,'' said Variety, ``they'd have had to change 
the title to `This Is Our Middle Age.' '' The delay cost the cast 
one original member, Josh Hamilton, who dropped out because of a scheduling 
conflict. He played the cynical 22-year-old in whose apartment the 
action takes place. ``It did occur that at some point the actors would 
get too old for this,'' Lonergan said wryly. Now that ``This Is Our 
Youth'' is onstage again, the Weisslers are hoping to transfer it 
commercially after the run at the nonprofit Second Stage. For his 
part, the author seems hesitant to celebrate. ``I'm really thrilled,'' 
Lonergan said, in typical deadpan, peering from heavy-framed glasses. 
``I don't wear my heart on my sleeve.'' Like his characters, Lonergan, 
at 36, still seems awkward talking about himself. He tends to speak 
in something between a mumble and a sigh and is quick to make fun 
of anything he says that might sound profound. ``This Is Our Youth'' 
is set in 1982, in the early years of the Reagan administration, a 
time when Lonergan was two years out of high school and ``taking a 
break'' from college. ``I remember that period as incredibly dangerous 
and perilous,'' he said. ``The left-wing team had suffered a defeat 
and the Zeitgeist was going in the other direction and there was this 
generation of well-educated, caring kids going around saying, `What's 
the point?' I found that incredibly depressing.'' He paused: ``I feel 
I should have an enormous pipe.'' At the center of the play is Warren 
Straub (played by Mark Ruffalo), a hyper 20-year-old dropout who has 
just stolen $15,000 from his divorced father after a squabble. He 
takes shelter in the apartment of Dennis Ziegler (Mark Rosenthal), 
a former ``dark cult god of high school'' just beginning to size up 
his personal limitations, and is visited there by Jessica Goldman 
(Missy Yager), a 20-year-old would-be fashion designer already jaded 
by romance. ``These are the kind of rich kids that are ashamed of 
being rich, the kind with a liberal, basket-weaving upbringing and 
Native American artifacts on the shelves,'' Lonergan said. ``They 
are much more developed than people think, and also half-developed 
at the same time.'' Scott Elliott, the artistic director of the New 
Group, decided to put on the play, he said, because ``I thought the 
voice was fresh and accurate, and I thought it would appeal to a younger 
group of people.'' Elliott, who was 34 when he presented ``This Is 
Our Youth,'' added: ``Many young people today are disaffected. They 
have been bombarded by the media, by television, by computers, so 
they're not bothered by anything anymore. They're numb.'' Lonergan's 
characters also struck a chord with Carole Rothman, the artistic director 
of Second Stage, when Brokaw, a resident director at the theater, 
brought her the script last spring. ``This is a play about kids that 
have a safety net and what happens when it frays,'' said Ms. Rothman, 
who has two children and lives on the Upper West Side. ``For anybody 
who has children, it couldn't be closer to home.'' Neither could the 
theater, which is on Broadway near 76th Street. Lonergan has taken 
the cast on a tour through the neighborhood, pointing out where the 
events that inspired him took place. He lives in Greenwich Village 
now, with his girlfriend, the actress J. Smith-Cameron, whom he met 
while he was staging a one-act there. ``She was slumming,'' Lonergan 
said with a grin. But he still hangs out at times with his high school 
crowd in the area that inspired the play. ``Everybody was tossing 
away some golden years,'' he said. ``But I hope I've taken a sympathetic 
view of it, because I'm in there, too.'' Lonergan was born in the 
Bronx, the younger of two boys, shortly before his family moved to 
Central Park West. His father, a doctor, and mother, a psychiatrist, 
divorced when he was 5. ``It was the best thing that ever happened,'' 
he said. ``They've both remarried and are happy. I'm very lucky. I'm 
the product of both a broken and a stable home.'' In 1977, he entered 
the Walden School, a private high school on Central Park West that 
subsequently merged with another institution. Known as an innovator 
in progressive education, it was home to a wide variety of talented, 
if eccentric, students. There, Lonergan said, all of the experiences 
that made their way into the play occurred. ``The only thing I made 
up was stealing that much money,'' he said. ``I never took more than 
$20.'' After graduating in 1980, he spent a year at Wesleyan University 
before realizing _ like Warren in the play _ that he did not want 
to be in college. Unlike his character, however, Lonergan found a 
calling: the theater. He landed a job working as a doorman for the 
Shubert Organization (``I smoked a lot of pot'') and began taking 
playwriting classes with Herbert Berghof at the HB Studio in Greenwich 
Village. It was there that his predilection for damaged people began. 
``I wrote a lot of plays with mentally ill characters,'' he said. 
``Just that idea of difficult people hurting themselves and you. I've 
always found that intensely interesting, as well as the idea of taking 
care of people.'' Among his early plays was ``The Rennings Children,'' 
about a mentally ill brother and the sister who tries to obtain his 
release from an asylum. While the plot may have been fabricated _ 
Lonergan says he doesn't know anyone ``really crazy'' _ the play foreshadowed 
the emotional terrain of ``This Is Our Youth,'' where parents are 
reduced to offstage voices with limited influence. The award he won 
for ``The Rennings Children,'' in the first Young Playwrights Festival 
in 1982, along with his parents' encouragement, persuaded Lonergan 
to go back to school, this time to the New York University drama writing 
program. After graduating in 1985, he staged several one-act plays 
with the Naked Angels troupe. That work drew the attention of agents 
and ultimately led to the screenwriting that has supported him for 
eight years. A film of his first script, for a comedy entitled ``Analyze 
This,'' will probably be released next year, he said. He is also writing 
a script for a forthcoming ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' movie (``They 
do not sit around the apartment and smoke pot'') and the screenplay 
for ``This Is Our Youth,'' which he also plans to direct. He had finished 
the stage script in 1995. ``It was one of the few plays I wanted to 
do after reading the first act,'' said Brokaw, the director. ``They're 
people I hadn't seen onstage before.''
