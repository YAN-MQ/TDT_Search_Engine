When Massive Attack came on the British dance-music scene in 1991 
with its debut album, ``Blue Lines,'' the group's bass-heavy beats 
and brooding spirit of introspection became the sonic blueprint for 
trip-hop. A studio-concocted blend of hip-hop, ambient techno and 
reggae that set the tone for fellow Bristol artists like Portishead 
and Tricky, trip-hop seemed ideally suited to our globally aware, 
culturally fragmented times. Spawned by the latest recording technologies, 
yet resolutely human in its message, it was steeped in the ironic 
film-noir paranoia of 60s spy movies and apocalyptic angst. Throughout 
the '90s, Massive Attack has maintained its underground appeal, partly 
because its music _ like trip-hop itself _ is a constantly mutating, 
sometimes clashing hybrid of styles and influences. Now Massive Attack 
is metamorphosing again, this time into a rock band. The group's muscular 
new sound, which was on display during the group's recent U.S. tour, 
signaled its continuing evolution from a loose confederacy of DJs, 
singers and studio wizards into a more conventional band that performs 
with live drums and guitars. On songs like ``Angel'' and ``Group Four,'' 
both from the group's new album, ``Mezzanine,'' the undulating dance 
pulse repeatedly morphs into spiraling electric guitar riffs. The 
enthusiastic response to the album and concerts was especially satisfying 
for Robert Del Nada, aka 3-D, one of the core members of the group 
and the catalyst behind its new sound. ``It really did bring in all 
the elements that made us,'' he said. ``Funk, soul, reggae, hip-hop 
and punk thing _ it was all there.'' It also showed that trip-hop 
has expanded well beyond the confines of its dance-beat origins, reflecting 
the multi-ethnic makeup of the genre's urban international audience. 
Most trip-hop bands are racially and sexually mixed, and their lyrics, 
while seldom overtly political, are charged with the social and economic 
apprehensions of the latest CNN headlines. And thanks to the rise 
of world music and a growing appreciation of native folk traditions, 
popular tastes are less parochial than they once were, paving the 
way for mass acceptance of trip-hop's polyglot textures. In fact, 
at a time when the boundaries between musical genres are increasingly 
blurred, trip-hop is becoming more diverse _ and relevant even, wrapping 
its mordant lyrics and sinuous beats around influences as disparate 
as Middle Eastern folk music, free-form jazz and Burt Bacharach. ``Trip-hop 
is the new world music,'' said the reggae singer Horace Andy, a longtime 
Massive Attack collaborator who contributed lyrics and vocals to several 
tracks on ``Mezzanine.'' ``It speaks to every culture.'' It also speaks 
to musicians who grew up listening to everything from Public Enemy 
and the Sex Pistols to Joni Mitchell and Pink Floyd and who are searching 
for open-ended forms of expression that will not limit their choices. 
In recent months, trip-hop's atmospheric strains have spawned a slew 
of ambitious new acts, including England's Pressure Drop, the Belgian 
band Hooverphonic and Canada's Esthero. ``I think music in general 
has kind of grown up in the past few years,'' said Del Naja. ``Everyone 
seems to have understood you could go in any direction that you want, 
and it's not something that has to be a cliche or generic. People 
are prepared to experiment.'' Last year, Del Naja joined his fellow 
Massive Attack co-founders, Grant (Daddy G) Marshal and Andrew (Mushroom) 
Vowles, in starting their own record label, Melankolic. Among its 
first releases were ``Skylarking Volume 1,'' a compilation of songs 
by Andy, and ``Come from Heaven'' by the British trip-hop newcomer 
Alpha, whose music has a breezy, retro feel and features samples of 
Herb Alpert and the Percy Faith Orchestra. For some bands, the trip-hop 
trend has provided a vehicle for exploring other musical terrain. 
While Morcheeba's 1996 debut album, ``Who Can You Trust?'' was squarely 
in a trip-hop mode, the commercial success of that album and a collaboration 
with David Byrne on his album ``Feelings'' freed the group to tap 
its '70s rock roots. As a result, its even stronger second album, 
``Big Calm,'' moves away from dance club grooves and takes a more 
song-oriented approach, incorporating sitar, banjo and peddle steel 
guitar. ``We never really considered ourselves a trip-hop band, although 
we jumped on that bandwagon to get a record deal and get some profile,'' 
said Paul Godfrey, the band's lead lyricist and self-styled conceptualist. 
``We've always been way diverse,'' he said, ``and the music that we 
were creating before `Who Can You Trust?' was country blues with fiddles 
and hip-hop beats. So `Big Calm,' in a way, was really a return to 
where we came from.'' Trip-Hop's founders, in fact, now reject the 
term as outdated and limiting. ``It doesn't describe our music at 
all,'' said Marshall of Massive Attack. Yet there are certain threads 
that continue to run through the genre, particularly a tendency toward 
slow, surging rhythms, minor-chord progressions and lyrics that evoke 
alienation and fear. There is also a palpable ambivalence toward technology, 
which can manifest itself in menacing drones and beeps or mellifluous 
rainbows of synthesized sound. And there is a free-floating sense 
of dread that has as much to do with race riots and terrorism as the 
emotional risks of post-modern romance. On the song ``Darkness,'' 
from Pressure Drop's album, ``Elusive,'' Anita Jarrett, accompanied 
by ominous bass lines and a funereal beat, sings: ``Something inside, 
under the skin/Deep, deep down, Deep within/You can't feel a thing/That's 
what darkness brings.'' ``When we write tracks we try to represent 
things going on around us,'' said David Henley, who along with Justin 
Langlands makes up the creative core of Pressure Drop. ``And in this 
world that were living in now, of mass communication and people not 
contacting each other physically as much, a lot of people are feeling 
quite insular, because they've sort of lost that contact of meeting 
people and interacting face to face. And I think that's increasing.'' 
For Maurice Bernstein, the president of Giant Step records and a British 
concert promoter who produced the first American concerts for Massive 
Attack and many other trip-hop acts, the music's downbeat vibe can 
at least be partly attributed to the social and cultural realities 
of the working-class British communities where the movement was born. 
``It's coming from their experience,'' said Bernstein. ``And they're 
offering an alternative to the groovy Cool Britannia image that usually 
gets offered to people. This is England the way they see it, and its 
a very dark score.'' Trip-hop bands also tend to eschew traditional 
song structures in favor of panoramic soundscapes that unfold and 
evolve with long instrumental passages, more like classical or jazz 
compositions than typical pop songs. On Pressure Drop's album, ``Elusive,'' 
woodwinds, trumpet and saxophone give the mix a bluesy, be-bop flavor, 
while on Hooverphonic's new album, ``Blue Wonder Powder Milk,'' Geike 
Arnaerts ethereal vocals float over lush string arrangements and gently 
pulsing rhythms. The propensity toward longer, more amorphous tracks 
springs from trip-hop's roots in the ambient techno raves of the late 
80s and early 90s, in which music, lighting effects and sometimes 
psychotropic drugs were used to induce an ecstatic, trancelike experience 
that could last all night. But Bernstein sees another explanation. 
``Kids spend most of their time now walking around with headphones 
on,'' he said. ``The Walkman has become part of our everyday reality. 
So what people are doing now is writing the soundtrack to their own 
lives.'' For trip-hop bands like Massive Attack, that sense of detachment 
translates into music that mixes well with visual images, and that 
compatibility has been noticed by filmmakers looking for fresh sounds 
to complement their work. Massive Attack has contributed to the soundtracks 
of ``Batman Returns,'' ``Welcome to Sarejevo'' and the sci-fi thriller 
``Phi.'' Craig Armstrong, the Scottish composer who arranged the strings 
on Massive Attacks 1994 album, ``Protection,'' and whose album, ``The 
Space Between Us,'' was released this year on Melankolic, has contributed 
to the soundtracks for ``Romero and Juliet'' and ``The Saint.'' And 
Hooverphonic's song ``2wicky'' was featured on the score of the Bernardo 
Bertolucci film ``Stealing Beauty.'' Despite such exposure, few trip-hop 
bands have been able to make their mark in an increasingly crowded 
market. ``All of the musical scenes that there have been in the past 
5 or 10 years, each of them seems to be strong in its own right,'' 
said Del Naja. ``You've got an enormous drum-and-bass scene, and an 
enormous techno scene, and then you've got places that play more mellow 
stuff and jazz. And once in a while something pops up and gets big 
and everything else stays underground, which is healthy.'' What remains 
to be seen is whether trip-hop, either in its original or mutated 
form, will ever gain amass following outside Europe's dance-club scene. 
``Is the next Massive Attack somewhere in America making the U.S. 
version of trip-hop?'' asked Bernstein. ``It would be pretty sad if 
there isn't. Because that's what it will take to push this to the 
next level.'' Perhaps, but in the United States, where many hit songs 
reflect the optimism of the American dream, trip-hop's dark streak 
of realism has failed to catch on with the record-buying public. That 
could change. If political cynicism and a gyrating stock market continue 
to take their toll on the public mood, trip-hop may yet prove to be 
the perfect soundtrack for our anxious times.
