The United States has become the first nation to ratify a new international 
agreement to out law bribery. NPR's Kathleen Chalk reports Two decades 
ago, the U.S. government made it illegal for American companies to 
bribe foreign officials. Other countries didn't follow suit. In fact, 
some European governments still allow businesses to deduct bribes 
from their taxes. American companies have often lost business because 
they had to be more scrupulous than their competitors, $20 billion 
worth of contracts in the past year alone, according to the U.S. Commerce 
Department. The new Anti-bribery Convention negotiated last December 
by the world's wealthy industrialized countries could finally level 
the playing field. Commerce Secretary William Daley says the agreement 
will change forever the way international business is conducted, but 
first, the other nations that signed the treaty must ratify it and 
change their laws to implement it. Kathleen Chalk, NPR News, Washington.
