A laughing group of comedians and actors who have been inspired in 
their work by Richard Pryor gathered on Tuesday night at the Kennedy 
Center for the Performing Arts to pay tribute to him. Robin Williams 
brought all the loose ends together when he recalled the Mark Twain 
observation that sorrow is a greater source of humor than happiness. 
But the laughter far outweighed the sorrow. The performers' acts served 
to remind the audience that Pryor, whose health problems include multiple 
sclerosis, was a pioneer among comics in creating characters who spoke 
in the true voice of the streets, obscenities and all. Many of the 
words heard during the tribute were probably coming from a Kennedy 
Center stage for the first time, and many cannot be repeated here. 
But the Comedy Central cable channel taped the event for showing on 
Jan. 20. The event was to honor Pryor as the first recipient of the 
Kennedy Center's award for humor, the Mark Twain Prize. Pryor sat 
in a box, but he was so weak that he could not rise to acknowledge 
the loud applause from the audience in the center's concert hall. 
``I'm glad to see you up there,'' said one of the entertainers, Morgan 
Freeman, who echoed another hallowed Twain remark by adding, ``Reports 
of your death were greatly exaggerated.'' At a party after the show, 
Pryor, 58, was unable to rise from his wheelchair and was barely able 
to say, in a low moan, ``Thank you,'' when James Johnson, the chairman 
of the Kennedy Center, gave him the award. ``Like Mark Twain, you 
made us laugh and also think,'' Johnson said. Williams said at the 
party that Pryor had been alert to the tributes paid him. ``He lights 
up,'' Williams said. ``You can see it.'' In his own appearance at 
the concert hall, Williams came onstage, saying he was scalping tickets 
to the hugely popular van Gogh show at the National Gallery of Art. 
``I've got two tickets to van Gogh,'' he said. ``Check it out. Two 
tickets. Two hundred bucks and you'll see `The Potato Eaters.' '' 
He refused to take a check. When his turn came, Freeman recalled yet 
another Twain observation, that he would rather see a taxidermist 
coming toward him than a tax collector. ``The taxidermist isn't going 
to take more than your skin,'' Freeman said. The comedian Damon Wayans 
said in his routine that he had drawn inspiration from Pryor, to a 
point. ``I wanted to be just like him,'' Wayans said, ``except for 
the drug habit, the failed marriages and the guns.'' Whoopi Goldberg 
also cited Twain in her remarks, saying: ``Suppose you were an idiot, 
and suppose you were a member of Congress. Oops, I repeat myself.'' 
The comedian Chris Rock said that Pryor had come on the scene ``between 
the two great plagues, disco and AIDS.'' Another comic, Richard Belzer, 
recalled one of his worst stage experiences, having to follow Pryor's 
act at the Improv in Manhattan. ``It's like having to paint a picture 
next to one by da Vinci,'' he said. The comedian and social activist 
Dick Gregory was on hand, not as a performer, but as a friend of Pryor's. 
``It must have thrilled him to be there and look down on it,'' Gregory 
said. ``It had to do a lot for him, to see that, to feel that.''
