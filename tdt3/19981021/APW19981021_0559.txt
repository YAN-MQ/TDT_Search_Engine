A private trading company Bartimpex has signed a dlrs 200 million 
contract to sell food to Moscow in 1999-2000, a company official said 
Wednesday. Bartimpex, which buys natural gas from Russia's giant Gazprom, 
agreed with Moscow authorities and food importer Exima that the money 
Poland pays for gas supplies will be spent on food, said the financial 
director of the Polish company, Jan Antosik. The structure of the 
deal should protect the company against turbulence in Russia's banking 
sector, Antosik said. ``We are in a comfortable situation because 
those payments are guaranteed by gas supplies'' he said. Antosik advocated 
Polish subsidies on food exports to Russia to allow Polish food manufacturers 
to compete with subsidized exports from western Europe. Experts estimate 
that Polish exports to Russia, which in 1997 amounted to dlrs 2.2 
billion, could be down by as much as 20 percent because of the Russian 
financial turmoil, the Rzeczpospolita newspaper reported. Russia is 
Poland's second largest export market, after Germany, and food comprises 
half of Polish exports to Moscow.
