World number one Pete Sampras has advanced to the second round of 
the Lyon Grand Prix Tennis Tournament in France. Sampras needed three 
sets Wednesday to slip past fellow American Todd Martin - 6-4, 1-6, 
6-4. Sampras seemed to be in trouble in the final game of the match 
until he broke Martin's serve. The number two and three-ranked players 
in the world also won their matches. Marcelo Rios of Chile ousted 
American Jeff Turango 6-3, 6-3. And Australian Patrick Rafter was 
also a 6-3, 6-3 winner over Hisha Mirazi of Morocco. Second-seeded 
American Andre Agassi has breezed into the second round of the Czech 
Indoor Open Tournament by beating Denmark's Kenneth Carlson in straight 
sets. Agassi, whose career has rebounded this year, defeated Carlson 
6-4, 6-4 on Wednesday. He'll face Magnus Norman of Sweden in the round 
of 16. Third-seed Carl Kuchera of Slovakia also advanced to the second 
round, but he needed three sets to beat Daniel Vacheck of the Czeck 
Republic -- 4-6, 7-6, 6-3. In second round action, both seventh seeded 
Thomas Enquist of Sweden and number eight, Thomas Johansen of Sweden, 
advanced to the next round. And that's a look at sports. I'm Steve 
Shy.
