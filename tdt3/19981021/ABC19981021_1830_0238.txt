If there is a new security agreement, it is not likely to reduce significantly 
the mistrust between them. In a quite stunning develop, the CIA is 
going to play a totally new role in the Middle East. It does not make 
everybody happy. Here's ABC's John McWethy. For the CIA there has 
never been anything quite like this. Never been a proposed agreement 
that puts the CIA so visibly in a position of middleman or so-called 
honest broker. Here's how it would work. The CIA would have agents 
operating in both Israeli and Palestinian secret police to help assess 
if each side is living up to the peace agreement. Some examples -- 
when Palestinians say they have arrested a suspected terrorist, the 
CIA would verify that the person really went to a Palestinian jail. 
This would reassure the Israelis and help the Palestinians to verify 
their claims that they are trying hard to apprehend terrorists within 
their jurisdiction. Most important, when there is an incident, like 
the grenade attack on monday that injured 60 Israelis, the CIA's presence 
would give both sides a Less politically charged way to help each 
other investigate. Critics say it puts America's spy agency in a terrible 
position.
