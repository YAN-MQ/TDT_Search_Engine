The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and other employee advocates advise 
job seekers to do the following: _ Order a copy of your credit report 
from the three major credit bureaus: Equifax (www.equifax.com), Experian 
(www.experian.com) and the Trans Union Corp. (www.tuc.com). If you 
find information that you think is incorrect, notify the creditor 
or credit bureau and get the issue resolved. _ Check public records. 
Go to the county or city courthouse and inspect files for accuracy, 
especially if you have an arrest record or have been involved in legal 
cases. Request a copy of your driving record from your state, especially 
if you are applying for a job that requires driving. _ Ask to see 
a copy of your personnel file from your old job. You generally have 
a right to see your file for at least a year after leaving a job. 
Ask your former employer if it has a policy on the release of personnel 
records; many companies limit such disclosures. _ Read the fine print 
on a job application because you may also be signing a statement that 
waives your right to a copy of your credit report or authorizes the 
disclosure of other personal data. _ Tell neighbors and colleagues, 
past and present, that they might be asked to provide information 
about you, particularly if you will be applying for sensitive or high-level 
positions. That may help alert you to any problems. _ Consider asking 
the interviewer about the company's privacy policies. Find out if 
the potential employer plans a background check and try to determine 
how the check will be conducted. See if the employer routinely double-checks 
negative reports before making decisions, especially if some or all 
of the information is found through the Web. Is it prudent for employees 
to ask these things? ``Absolutely,'' said Alan F. Westin, publisher 
of the Privacy and American Business newsletter. But will such questions 
tempt an employer to drop a person's resume in the round file? ``Could 
be,'' he said.
