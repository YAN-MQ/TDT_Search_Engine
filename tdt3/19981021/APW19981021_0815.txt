Official figures account for only a small fraction of Russia's crime 
rate, which could soar during the current economic crisis, members 
of the Russian Criminologist Association said Wednesday. Government 
figures indicate crime has decreased in the past few years, but the 
criminologists said the real rate is up to hundreds of times higher. 
The Interior Ministry says there were 2.4 million crimes in Russia 
last year, 200,000 fewer than in 1996. ``These are absurd statistics,'' 
Viktor Luneyev, a member of the criminologist association, said at 
a news conference. ``We should stop pretending to have a low crime 
rate while the whole world shudders from fear of our crime.'' Luneyev 
and his colleagues say Russians do not report many crimes to police 
and police then vastly under-report crime to make themselves look 
good and to earn perks. ``If they register all crimes, the legal system 
will collapse instantly,'' Luneyev said. Government officials, including 
Russia's top cop, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, acknowledged 
the problem earlier this year and pledged to stop it. Human rights 
activists also say that police officers frequently break the law themselves 
and that many are involved in torture, coercion and rape. Luneyev 
said at least 15 million crimes are committed in Russia annually. 
He said some estimates suggest there are as many as two crimes per 
capita every year, or almost 300 million crimes in this country of 
147 million people. Only four to five percent of economic crimes are 
registered, and half of all murders, Luneyev said. ``In the last few 
years, police registered about 30,000 premeditated murders a year, 
while the number of unidentified bodies plus the number of missing 
persons was 40,000-45,000,'' he said. The criminal experts warned 
that the current economic crisis could lead to a new increase in crime, 
partly by fueling turf battles among criminal clans controlling a 
large share of Russia's economy. ``The drop in the number of people 
who pay extortion money to mobsters would intensify the fighting between 
them,'' Luneyev said.
