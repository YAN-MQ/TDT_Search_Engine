As Middle East peace talks dragged late into the night of the seventh 
day on Wednesday, the Israeli side threatened to walk out and go home, 
demanding changes in a draft agreement on security approved by both 
the Palestinians and the Americans. Over the last seven days, the 
Americans, Israelis and Palestinians have been working to produce 
a final, agreed text of some 20 pages that lays out the phased exchange 
of 13 percent of West Bank land over 12 weeks in return for specific 
Palestinian actions to fight terrorism. After meeting late on Wednesday 
afternoon with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to go over an 
American document spelling out the terms of an agreement, Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel issued a a statement saying that there 
``can be no agreement'' unless ``substantial progess'' was made on 
two issues _ a commitment by the Palestine National Council to publicly 
change its charter and renounce its call for the destruction of the 
state of Israel and a deal to extradite Palestinians wanted for allegedly 
attacking Israelis. Arafat has said that the Palestine national charter 
has been stripped of its clauses demanding the destruction of Israel, 
but Israelis complain the amended charter has never been published. 
Arafat has offered to have an amended charter approved by the smaller 
Palestine Executive Council of the National Council, but the Israelis 
insist that the whole National Council meet for a public vote within 
three months. On extradition _ which the Israelis call ``transfer'' 
in order not to prematurely recognize the Palestinian Authority as 
a legal state _ Netanyahu wants some 36 individuals handed over to 
Israel for trial. Israel charges them with involvement in attacks 
against Israelis, and at least some of them serve in the Palestinian 
police. The Americans believe they have worked out a satisfactory 
compromise. Under this plan, the CIA, which sits on a security committee 
with Palestinian and Israeli security chiefs, will vet the Israeli 
cases and decide which Palestinians should be jailed and tried, but 
in Palestinian courts. The Israelis apparently find this compromise 
unacceptable. The Israelis also say they want firm Palestinian commitments 
to reduce the number of Palestinian police to numbers laid out in 
the Oslo accords and to confiscate unregistered, illegal weapons. 
The Americans believe those issues are also essentially settled. An 
agreement is also supposed to include the immediate resumption of 
Israeli-Palestinian talks on a final peace settlement _ which is supposed 
to be complete by May 4, 1999, when the Oslo process that governs 
the relations between Israel and the Palestinians runs out. Even while 
Albright and Netanyahu were meeting late on Wednesday afternoon, Israeli 
officials were busily and visibly bringing packed suitcases out on 
to the lawn. A senior American official said the Israeli drama was 
crude and that Albright was ``bemused'' by the display. But it was 
a dramatic example of the brinksmanship American officials expected 
during the end game of these tortuous negotiations. ``My betting is 
that will turn out to be a childish ploy,'' the official said. ``I 
wouldn't think their private posture is quite as stark as their public 
posture.'' American officials made it clear that in their view the 
Palestinians had done enough to keep these talks going, and that the 
Americans would put the onus for any failure on the Israelis.
