Facing mounting consumer debts, Ukraine's Naftogas company has cut 
off gas to thousands of industries, state institutions and distributors 
catering to public needs, the company's deputy chairman said Wednesday. 
Taras Freiuk told a Cabinet meeting that various consumers have paid 
his state-run company 2.8 million hryvna (dlrs 816 million at the 
current rate) for gas supplied so far in 1998. But they owe another 
3.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 991 million) for 1998 gas supplies and a 
total of 11.8 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.44 billion), including debts 
from previous years, Freiuk said. He said his company already has 
cut off 13,700 debtors, thus reducing recent gas consumption by 12 
percent, the Interfax news agency reported. But the measure might 
be short-lived when it comes to public consumption, which amounts 
to about 25 percent of the total. The government has pledged to issue 
an order forbidding suppliers to cut gas to distributors serving the 
general public during the winter. Also Wednesday, First Deputy Premier 
Anatoliy Holubchenko suggested that the government would pay its debts 
to state-supported regions with gas _ not cash.
