Results of game three of the world series are next in "Headline Sports." 
A little later -- meet a volunteer who epitomizes the spirit of giving. 
This is a world only a few know well. A world of risk and uncertainty. 
Where the roads can take you to success... or prosperity. Or sometimes... 
to no place at all. This is the financial world. For decades, banks 
and investment firms of mountainous size... have ruled the land. Yet, 
high above the horizon another mountain has risen. A mountain called 
first union. With 16 million customers, the nation's eighth largest 
brokerage... and sixth largest bank. For a new perspective of the 
financial world. Come to the mountain called first union. Or if you 
prefer, the mountain will come to you.
