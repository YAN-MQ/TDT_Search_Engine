Dow Jones &AMP; Co. announced Wednesday that its president and chief 
operating officer, Kenneth L. Burenga, will retire at the end of the 
year. The announcement comes seven months after the company jettisoned 
its troubled financial services unit, selling it to Bridge Information 
Systems Inc. for $510 million, a loss of $1 billion. Burenga had been 
closely identified with the futile and costly efforts to keep that 
business afloat. Burenga's retirement comes as the company's board 
approved a new three-year financial plan and a new management structure 
that, for the moment, eliminates Burenga's jobs of president and chief 
operating officer. Instead, top management will be the responsibility 
of a group of executives, consisting of the company's chief financial 
officer, Jerry Bailey, its general counsel, Peter G. Skinner, and 
a group of executives who run the company's three business divisions. 
Bailey and Skinner were both named executive vice presidents Wednesday. 
The company also authorized a stock buyback of up to $500 million 
Wednesday. That brings to $800 million the amount the company has 
authorized for stock buybacks. The management reorganization leaves 
the company with no clear successor to its current chief executive, 
chairman Peter R. Kann. The executive watched most closely by financial 
analysts is Bailey, whose cost trimming since he joined the company 
this spring has caught Wall Street's attention. ``Jerry Bailey's had 
an impact on the company and will continue to have an impact on the 
company,'' said Edward J. Atorino, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella. 
Steven N. Barlow, who follows the company for Credit Suisse First 
Boston, said Bailey has put ``some structure into the budgeting and 
planning cycles, not only on the quarter to quarter basis but looking 
out several years into the future.'' The price of Dow Jones shares 
rose 31.25 cents Wednesday to $44.0625. The stock price peaked at 
$57.1875 in July, the same week the stock market peaked. Burenga said 
the management change ``streamlines the organization, flattens it 
out. The three major groups will report directly to the chairman.'' 
The groups he referred to are the print publishing division, which 
includes the flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, as well 
as the financial weekly Barron's; the electronic publishing division, 
which includes the Interactive edition of The Wall Street Journal, 
Dow Jones Interactive _ an online news retrieval and financial information 
service _ and Dow Jones news wires; and the community newspaper division, 
which publishes 19 daily newspapers and 17 weeklies in 12 states. 
Bailey is credited with pushing for cutbacks in the community newspaper 
division and other cost controls that improved its profit margins. 
The news of Burenga's departure was greeted with relief by one of 
the company's most outspoken shareholders, William C. Cox III, who 
is a member of the extended family that controls, through a complex 
series of trusts, the vast majority of the company's supervoting shares. 
The company's board of directors, which includes such nonfamily members 
as Frank N. Newman, chief executive of Bankers Trust Corp., and Harvey 
Golub, the chief executive of American Express, met Wednesday and 
approved the executive shifts. Cox, who has long called for the ouster 
of Kann and Burenga, said in an interview that he believed the departure 
of Burenga was ``a first step.'' He added, ``It would be my hope that 
the other shoe is going to drop'' and Kann, too, would resign. Burenga, 
who is 54, began work at Dow Jones 32 years ago in the circulation 
department of The Wall Street Journal. He said that he will be joining 
his son in a small firm investing in short-line railroads in New Jersey. 
Cox is one of only two family members who have spoken out against 
the company's current management and it is unclear whether any other 
members of the extended family share his views. Burenga said he orchestrated 
his own departure. After presenting the board of directors with the 
three-year financial plan, Burenga said in an interview, ``I gave 
some thought to what is the best way to organize the company with 
the focus narrowed on our core competencies. ``I concluded _ and ultimately 
the chairman agreed and the board agreed _ that there's just not a 
need for a president and chief operating officer at this point or 
going forward.'' But Cox scoffed at Burenga's explanation, saying, 
``Do I believe that? Absolutely not.'' To continue without a president, 
he said, ``would be a radical departure from the way Dow Jones has 
conducted its business for the past 100 years.'' The problems with 
Dow Jones Markets, the service once known as Telerate, were the defining 
event in Burenga's last years at the company. In the years immediately 
after the financial services division was purchased, piecemeal, ``it 
was really a contributor,'' he said. But the rise of Bloomberg's financial 
service and enhanced competition from Reuters, coupled with Telerate's 
increasingly outdated technology, backed Telerate into a corner. Two 
years ago, Burenga supported a plan to sink $685 million into the 
now-renamed Dow Jones Markets, seeking to revamp the technology and 
make the service competitive again. According to Richard Tofel, a 
company spokesman, only $160 million of that had been invested before 
the company reversed course and decided on the sale. Asked if he had 
any regrets about those decisions, Burenga said, ``I don't think you 
can roll back the clock _ decisions management made and the board 
made five years ago, three years ago, were right at the time. You 
can't always control market conditions.''
