Most senators are heading home to campaign after passing the last 
Bill of the 105th Congress. The $500 billion budget deal was approved 
this morning by a 65-29 vote. It cleared the house last night, so 
now it will be sent to the White House. That could take some work. 
The 4,000-page Bill weighs about 40 pounds and is about 18 inches 
tall.
