After all of the hope that a break through may be near in the Middle 
East talks, today the struggle begins. This is aimed at hammering 
out a deal on peace in the Middle East. The White House put another 
proposal on the table. The Israeli strategy included a threat to walk 
out. For the latest, we are joined now by NBC's White House correspondent 
Claire shipman. Tom, tonight the talks are in crisis, U.S. officials 
say they are disappointed but they think that may be a bluff. Right 
now the president has no plans to return to the talks in Maryland. 
It is a roller coaster ride here says one aide. Bill Clinton has spent 
close to 57 hours playing diplomat -- today wanting progress from 
the Israelis and Palestinians before returning to wye plantation. 
I have to go take a call from secretary Albright and see if I'm going 
back. But the two sides spent the day squabbling -- the Israelis threatening 
to return home. "Our bags are packed," the prime minister's spokesman 
said. The Palestinians accuse the Israelis of backing away from an 
agreement on land and security issues. I think that prime minister 
Netanyahu should take a courageous decision in order to say yes to 
President Clinton. But the Israelis want more concessions on the issue 
of security. The U.S. says that they think enough concessions have 
been made. Now the Palestinian leader tried to woo Netanyahu who turned 
49 today with a birthday card and some other things. They think that 
the chances of aaccord are receding rapidly. They worry that if the 
talks do fail, there could be a new wave of terrorism in the Middle 
East.
