Time now for a look at the weather across the country. We go do WNBC 
television in New York, meteorologist Janice huff. Good evening. We 
are happy to say that the rain has eased over those flooded areas 
of south eastern Texas. There's still light showers occurring just 
to the north of Austin and San Antonio over central Texas and some 
heavier rain down near Brownsville, but a relatively clear day across 
the flooded areas, so a chance to dry out. Across the southwest, stoirm 
weather in parts of Arizona and New Mexico and some isolated showers, 
a coal rain near Pittsburgh and Ohio. Temperatures in the 40's across 
the Great Lakes, 30's along the northern Great Lakes and arrow head 
of Minnesota. Looking for lows in the 20's there tonight and the 30's 
as far south as Tennessee. Lows in the 40's in the carolinas and Georgia 
tonight. A little taste of the fall chill dipping south. Highs tomorrow 
in the northeast, 40's and 50's across the south, 80's across southern 
California, with a chance for showers in Phoenix with a high of 89, 
66 Seattle, 55, Washington, D.C., and stormy in Miami. That's the 
weather tarn nation. Back to you. Janice, thank you.
