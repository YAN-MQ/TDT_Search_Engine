Premier-designate Massimo D'Alema on Wednesday announced a center-left 
government which includes eight holdovers from his predecessor and 
doubles the number of women in the Cabinet to six. The government 
was to be sworn in later in the day. The highly respected Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi will stay on as treasury and budget minister and Vincenzo Visco 
continues as finance minister. The two are key figures in pushing 
through a1999 budget maintaining Italy's economic commitments to the 
European Monetary Union. Another respected figure, Foreign Minister 
Lamberto Dini, will also stay on. D'Alema's Cabinet will have 25 ministers, 
four more than outgoing Premier Romano Prodi's. Parliament is expected 
to take a vote of confidence Friday so that D'Alema will be premier 
in time to attend the European Union summit in Austria on Saturday. 
D'Alema, an ex-Communist turned social democrat, is putting together 
a government that includes members of Prodi's coalition buttressed 
by new backing from the center and the Communists. In return for the 
support of ex-President Francesco Cossiga, D'Alema gave Cossiga's 
centrist party the defense, and post and telecommunications ministries 
and a new portfolio: relations with parliament. The Italian Communists 
got the justice ministry and regional affairs, the Greens kept environment, 
and D'Alema's own party, the Democratic Left, got seven posts. Among 
them is labor, which went to Naples' high-profile mayor, Antonio Bassolino. 
D'Alema also appointed a special minister, ex-Premier Guiliano Amato, 
to push through reforms in Italy's electoral system, which is blamed 
for the country's ``revolving door'' governments. Prodi's center-left 
government, Italy's 55th since the war, fell on Oct. 9 when hard-line 
Communists withdrew their support in a dispute over the budget. The 
president then turned to D'Alema, leader of the largest party in Prodi's 
coalition, to form a new government.
