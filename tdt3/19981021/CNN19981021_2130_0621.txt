Meanwhile, Netscape released a new version of its browser this week 
with a Feature designed to get customers to choose Netscape over Microsoft. 
Ann Kellan has more in this edition of "tech trends." When Microsoft 
wove its web browser, Internet explorer, into its Windows 98 operating 
system, Netscape, with its competing browser, cried unfair and has 
been trying to get even with Microsoft not only in the courtroom but 
with a new version of its browser, Netscape communicator 4.5. They're 
delighted to see Microsoft in the hot seat. As far as the new version, 
I think it's better than Internet explorer. So yeah, they're getting 
even pushing ahead. If you load Microsoft's Windows 98 on your computer, 
odds are you'll end up trying Microsoft's web browser, but Netscape 
is trying to even the odds with Microsoft's Internet explorer and 
get you to use netscape as your primary browser. It happens automatically 
unless you uncheck these boxes when you load the new version of Netscape 
onto your computer. Netscape becomes your default browser. Any software 
program like this encyclopedia, will automatically link to the internet 
through the default browser. So is there a better browser? "Technology" 
editor Bill husted finds the new version of Netscape faster but -- 
It's almost like the difference between a Chevrolet and a Ford. There's 
not a great difference in the two products. It's more being familiar 
with one and just, you tend to stay with the same one you've used. 
Both, he says, are big and bulky. And Netscape could take an hour 
to install. Each product gets loaded with new features and most of 
us just want to cruise the dang web! Ironically, so as the competition 
wages on between the two browser giants, husted sings the praise of 
yet another browser, called opera, takes up half the space in your 
computer and runs twice as fast. Ann Kellan, "Headline News."
