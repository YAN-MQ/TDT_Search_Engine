White House attorneys are at odds with the house Judiciary committee. 
The two sides met today to discuss the upcoming impeachment inquiry 
of President Clinton. The White House is expressing frustration over 
the pace and parameters of the process. Panel members say they are 
following procedure. "The Washington Post" reports, Monica Lewinsky's 
attorneys may make a deal to keep the former White House intern from 
testifying before the Linda tripp grand jury. The grand jury is considering 
whether Tripp broke any laws when she taped phone conversations she 
had with Lewinsky.
