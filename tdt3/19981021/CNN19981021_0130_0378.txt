It's time for the medical community to catch up with other professions 
and get online. At least that's what Dr. Tom Ferguson wrote in this 
week's "journal of the american medical association." Ferguson says 
Internet-savvy patients would like greater digital access to their 
physicians. But he says only 1% or 2% of doctors offer the option. 
He says it's time for them to start, or they could soon find themselves 
at a disadvantage. There are many benefits for the patient. For one 
thing, it's convenient. So convenient that people can ask about things 
that they probably wouldn't bother to go to the doctor to ask about. 
Another advantage is that there's a complete record for the communication. 
So instead of having to rely on their memories for all the things 
the doctors had, all the names, dosages, times, directions for self 
care. It's all written down so you can refer to it, share it with 
family members. You can also forward copies of your doctors E-mail 
to friends, family members, other doctors if you want to. A Boston 
hospital has found computers can cure one widespread problem, doctor's 
unreadable handwriting. It found the number of serious medication 
errors dropped by more than half once doctors started typing their 
prescriptions into a computer. The computer also limited doses to 
appropriate amounts and double checked for other problems like drug 
allergies. The report is in this week's journal of the American medical 
association.
