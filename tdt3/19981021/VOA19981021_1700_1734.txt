Time to talk about frequencies, Tom. I'll get on with some business 
here. If you're listening to us in Oceania or the Pacific, you can 
consider switching over right now to 9.705 megahertz short wave, which 
we're now broadcasting on from 2100 to 00 hour universal time. We'd 
be happy to mail you a VOA frequency schedule, but you'll need to 
send us your name and address. Send it off to VOA NEWS NOW, Voice 
of America, Washington, D.C. 20547, USA. Or you can email us that 
information. Our email address is NEWSNOW@VOA.GOV. And in this case, 
NEWS NOW is one word. So stay with us as NEWS NOW continues. It's 
21 hours, 30 universal time and this is VOA NEWS NOW. At the Mideast 
summit, the U.S. is trying to get the two sides to settle their differences. 
Palestinian officials have carried out two series of arrests aimed 
at weakening the militant Palestinian group Hamas in Hebron. Dateline 
examines the debate over the international financial obligations of 
the U.S. All that and the latest on dinosaurs in Alaska. Sounds great, 
Tom. This is all coming up in our next half hour of VOA NEWS NOW. 
First a summary of the latest world news.
