HEBRON, West Bank (AP) - Palestinian security officials said Wednesday 
they have intercepted a letter from a Hamas leader in Jordan that 
contained information leading to the arrest of more than a dozen members 
of the group's military wing. The letter was written by Khalid Mashaal, 
a Hamas political leader in Jordan who was the target last year of 
a botched assassination attempt by Israel's Mossad spy agency. In 
his letter to Mohammed Natche, a Hamas activist in Hebron, Mashaal 
outlined the activities of the group's military wing, Izzedine al 
Qassam, and referred to Qassam members by their initials, said a Palestinian 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. As a result, 16 members 
of the Hamas military wing were arrested in the past two weeks. Arrests 
continued Tuesday when 15 Hamas members were rounded up because they 
apparently had ties to Salem Rajab Sarsour, a Hebron man who threw 
two hand grenades in the Israeli town of Beersheba on Monday, injuring 
64 people. The Mashaal letter was found in Natche's possessions. Natche 
was arrested by Palestinian police last month after a bomb factory 
was discovered in his home. Palestinian security officials also said 
they have begun following the Hamas money trail. Bank account numbers 
have been collected and the financial transactions are being watched, 
said a Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Israel has long demanded that the Palestinians crack down on Hamas 
by arresting and disarming militants and stopping the flow of money 
from Hamas leaders abroad to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
