Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his delegation has 
packed its bags and is prepared to lead the Middle East peace talks 
in Maryland. He said the draft agreement on security is not tough 
enough on the Palestinians. Steven Saccher reports from Y Mills in 
Maryland. Mr. Netanyahu released a statement saying "If there will 
be substantial progress, we will stay. If not, we will go." He set 
a local time deadline for the Israeli departure. Officials said bags 
were already being loaded onto an aircraft. The Israelis are unhappy 
with a draft document being prepared by the Americans. It does not, 
they say, require the Palestinians to meet their obligations. The 
Palestinians have accepted the U.S. draft agreement for now. The Americans 
say they don't want to even contemplate the consequences of this summit 
collapsing. Steven Saccher, BBS News, Y Mills, Maryland.
