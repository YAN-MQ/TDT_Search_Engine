Two bullet-riddled cars in which five ethnic Albanian guerrillas died 
and Milazim Krasniqi's black eye showed the state of security Saturday 
in the shattered Kosovo village of Opterusha. The guerrillas were 
ambushed Friday by Serb police, who routinely patrol the village and 
beat anyone trying to move back, Krasniqi said. He repeated the assertion 
of ethnic Albanian refugees everywhere in Kosovo: Until Serb police 
withdraw completely, ``There's no way I'm spending the night here.'' 
Violence in Kosovo is growing again despite an accord designed to 
end bloodshed in the turbulent Serbian province and set the stage 
for a political agreement between Serb authorities and the province's 
majority ethnic Albanians. Seven ethnic Albanians, all believed to 
be guerrilla fighters, have been killed since Thursday afternoon. 
The Serb Media Center, a mouthpiece for Serb officials, said the deaths 
occurred in a series of attacks by guerrillas on police. No police 
were reported killed or injured. Foreign observers say attacks by 
both Serb forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas have increased this 
week. Such violence violates the Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, reached 
under the threat of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslav and Serb forces in 
Kosovo. While Milosevic has complied with some aspects of the agreement, 
complaints of attacks by Serb police on some of the tens of thousands 
of refugees trying to return to their homes have continued. The rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army also has launched attacks, mostly on police 
targets. Milosevic stripped the majority Albanians of self-rule in 
1989 in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. 
That sparked protests and increased violence that led to his crackdown 
on ethnic Albanian separatists in February. The rebels have rejected 
any political agreement that stops short of full independence for 
Kosovo, although they grudgingly agreed to stop fighting if not attacked. 
Kosovo Serbs protested a possible political deal Saturday, saying 
it would result in Milosevic effectively handing Kosovo to the ethnic 
Albanians. A gathering of Serbs in Pristina, including Serb leaders, 
opposition politicians and Serbian Orthodox Church dignitaries, said 
they opposed having Milosevic's regime sign any agreement on Kosovo 
on their behalf. In a unanimously adopted charter, the Pan-Serb Convention 
warned the international community of a likely ``massive exodus of 
Serbs'' if ethnic Albanians come to power in Kosovo. Also Saturday, 
two blood-stained, bullet-riddled cars driven by the slain rebels 
sat on the roadside near Opterusha, 55 kilometers (35 miles) southwest 
of Pristina. Both cars appeared to have been shot at from head-on. 
The Serb Media Center report said the rebels fired on a police patrol 
first, but Krasniqi disagreed. ``The police ambushed them as they 
drove down the road,'' he said. ``There's no chance they could have 
survived.'' Krasniqi said police beat him and other residents when 
they tried to return to their homes this week. His right eye was bruised. 
``They beat me just because I'm Albanian,'' he said. ``Now everyone 
is staying away.''
