For many people, the body shop is the place to buy products to make 
them look good. But Hong Kong police are concerned some people could 
be using these products for other reasons. Mike Chinoy reports. Some 
people like to get high with a little help from their friends. But 
from their soap, or massage oil? Well, that's what's worrying Hong 
Kong police about a new range of products on sale at the cosmetics 
company the body shop -- products made out of hemp, the same plant 
from which marijuana is derived. The products have hemp in them. And 
they have a negligible amount of thc, which is the psychoactive drug 
that marijuana contains, but nearly -- not nearly enough to have any 
effects if one tried to smoke it or tried to extract the thc from 
our products. Still, the police aren't convinced. The narcotics squad 
has seized samples of the hemp-based oils, soaps and skin creams to 
test them for thc, to make sure Hong Kong drug laws aren't being violated. 
Fueling police suspicions was the press kit sent out by the body shop 
for local journalists, which included this packet of cannabis seeds, 
supposedly chemically sterilized, but with a warning that it would 
be illegal to try and grow them. Anyone convicted of cultivating or 
selling marijuana here could face up to 15 years in jail. But that 
hasn't deterred customers, who've been scooping up the hemp products 
in steadily growing numbers. I just heard the lady introduce me that 
-- this product, she said it's okay. It's not really the kind of Dama, 
the grass, that we usually associate with the drugs. In fact, even 
as the police investigation continues, body shop officials insist 
you'd have to smoke a cigarette of their marijuana seeds the size 
of a telephone pole to get even slightly high. Mike Chinoy, CNN, Hong 
Kong.
