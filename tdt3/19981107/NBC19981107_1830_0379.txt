The vacancy at the top of the house, the speaker's post, also means 
a Vacancy in Congress -- in this case, the seat from a suburban Atlanta 
district that has belonged to Newt Gingrich for 20 years. NBC's kenley 
Jones is in Georgia's sixth district tonight. There were a lot of 
glum faces at the bi-weekly breakfast meeting of Gingrich's supporters 
in his home district today. I don't know what to think. I'm astounded. 
They kept talking in the past tense. One thing's for sure, we wouldn't 
be sittin' here Talkin' about good things that have happened over 
the past four years if it weren't for Newt gingrich. And now they 
have to find a candidate to fill his seat in congress when he resigns. 
Well, it's going to be hard to fill his shoes. In fact, I don't know 
if anybody can really fill Newt Gingrich's shoes. Aside from the personal 
aspect of Gingrich's resignation, there is a Practical matter. As 
speaker he held a lot of clout. And in Congress, clout equals pork. 
Gingrich was able to keep military contracts coming to Lockheed aircraft, 
sometimes even when the Pentagon said it didn't need any more planes. 
In an era of base closings or other federal installations, they may 
very well go away and we may lose some of the jobs related to that, 
that a Speaker is in a position to help get. At a strategy meeting 
this morning, several GOP county chairman expressed bitterness that 
it is Gingrich who is leaving office rather than bill Clinton. I applaud 
Newt for saying I am not going to hold back my party, I am not going 
to hold back the people of this country like our president is doing. 
Gingrich's supporters say he may be down now, but not out for good. 
Already some of them are talking about backing him for a presidential 
run in the year 2000. Kenley Jones, NBC news, Marietta, Georgia.
