Former President Jimmy Carter says Honduras and Nicaragua may need 
more than a decade to recover from hurricane Mitch. Emergency supplies 
are pouring into the region, but the aid is not getting to the people 
who need it. Carter, who is in Nicaragua, is asking international 
lenders to forgive debts owed by the two countries hard-hit by the 
hurricane. Devastated roads and limited air transportation are causing 
many desperate survivors to wait for food and medicine. Hurricane 
Mitch is blamed for 10,000 deaths.
