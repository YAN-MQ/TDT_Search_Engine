Their reputation seems to have outrun them. Just a year ago the Jets' 
special teams were the toast of the club, arguably the most important 
units in a surprising franchise resurgence. Indeed, they were probably 
the best in the league with Leon Johnson returning punts, Aaron Glenn 
dashing back on kickoffs, players such as Chris Hayes tackling opposing 
kick-returners, and John Hall launching oval missiles into the end 
zone. But the special magic has not been there this season, even though 
the Jets are a better club. And that is probably the reason. When 
they take the field at the Meadowlands Sunday to start the season's 
second half against the Bills, the offense will be expected to score 
points, the defense will be expected to stuff the Bills, and the special 
teams ... well, they will try to improve in some areas that have simply 
become mediocre, and they will have to do it without their punt return 
specialist, Leon Johnson, and with a new punter, John Kidd. Johnson's 
injury is the latest to hit the special teams, where a domino effect 
has been at work all season. The biggest impact has been to the linebackers, 
a unit that lost Marvin Jones and the rookie Casey Dailey to injuries 
during the summer. As a result of those injuries, the Jets had to 
curtail the special teams play of two of their best players on kick 
coverage teams, Dwayne Gordon and Chad Cascadden because they became 
virtual starting linebackers. Those difficulties were further compounded 
when Cascadden was injured, knocking him out of action for three games. 
``The other teams have definitely been doubling up on Marcus Coleman 
and me,'' said Hayes, a proud man who looks at special-teams play 
as ``my chance as a starter.'' Cascadden returns Sunday, but with 
Johnson out with a sprained knee, the domino effect continues. Dedric 
Ward will take Johnson's place returning punts and Ward's place next 
to Glenn on the kickoff-return unit will be taken by Kevin Williams. 
With injuries serving as the great equalizer, the falloff of the special 
teams is evident in the statistics: _ Last year, the Jets had 3 returns 
for touchdowns. This year they have none. _ Last year Johnson's longest 
punt return was 66 yards. This year, 19. _ Last year Johnson's longest 
kickoff return was 101 yards. This year, 37. _ Last year no opponent 
had a return for a touchdown. This year, 1. _ The Jets' punting ranks 
29th in the league and the field-goal percentage is 26th at 64.7 percent. 
Perhaps the Jets' punt returns will improve in the colder weather 
that is sure to come. Coach Bill Parcells theorizes that return men 
are likely to break longer runs ``in bad weather, when players don't 
like making tackles.'' Parcells also claims that the Jets are victims 
of their success last season; he says that opposing teams are now 
kicking the ball straight up rather than risk a return. In fact, the 
Jets' opponents have had the lowest punting average against them of 
any team in the league _ 41. That indicates that the strategy has 
been to kick it high and force a fair catch or middling return. Thus, 
Johnson's average has sagged from 12.1 yards _ sixth-best in the league 
_ to 7.8 yards, well below the league leaders. Bills punter Chris 
Mohr is likely to use the same tactic despite the absence of Johnson. 
Mohr has been trained to get his punts high, allowing his coverage 
team to pounce on the receiver. ``You never know what a team will 
do week to week,'' Ward said. ``Just because the Bills have covered 
a certain way all season, it doesn't mean they won't change this time.'' 
The Jets have not fared any better punting the ball away either. Brian 
Hansen, the 38-year-old punter, was unloaded in favor of another veteran, 
John Kidd, after Hansen shanked punts in consecutive games for the 
first time in his career and his punting average skidded to 29th in 
the league. Kidd, who is 37, said his instructions are ``to do what's 
right for the situation _ if we're backed up to our goal-line, kick 
it far, if we're near the other goal-line, kick it high.'' Kidd has 
another valuable talent _ he is a good holder. Last year, when Hansen 
was out for parts of two games, quarterback Glenn Foley spotted the 
ball for Hall. Hall made only one of five field-goal attempts with 
Foley holding. ``I got John comfortable in a short time,'' Kidd said. 
``The first day of practice, John kicked 19 of 20, and that gave him 
confidence.'' Hall, who kicked the winning field goal in Kansas City 
last Sunday as time ran out, said he is feeling pretty good about 
himself. Yet his field-goal average is even lower than last year's 
so-so mark of 68 percent, and his kickoffs do not go into the end 
zone as consistently. He has 12 touchbacks this season, but last year 
at the halfway point had 22. Still, he said, ``I don't want to change 
anything.'' In fact, the Jets kickoff unit has remained a strength. 
Glenn came up with a critical return in the last game when he brought 
a kickoff back 62 yards to set up a critical touchdown in the Jets' 
victory at Kansas City. And the Jets are the only team in the league 
that ranks in the top five both in returning kicks and halting the 
opposition's kick returner. Now, with cold weather returning to the 
region, perhaps Parcells will be right and the rest of the special 
teams will find their stride. Hayes, for one, believes that will happen. 
``We'll see what happens the second half of the season,'' said Hayes. 
``They're going to need us to come up big at some point.''
