Checking the top stories -- house speaker Newt Gingrich has decided 
to resign from Congress. He announced his plans Friday in a conference 
call to fellow republicans. He told them he's putting the party ahead 
of his own ambitions. Possible successors already are lining up. Louisiana 
congressman Bob Livingston announced his candidacy for the speakership 
Friday, even before Gingrich's decision. Congressman Chris Cox of 
California also says he's in the running.
