"Saturday night live" alumnus Adam Sandler returns to the silver screen 
in "The waterboy." Bill Tush takes a look. Now that's what I call 
high quality h2o. You've heard of "dumb and dumber," here's a guy 
who looks like a Candidate for "dumbest." Look at me, I'm the waterboy. 
duh. But don't let Bobby Boucher's backward ways fool you. Bobby Boucher 
-- I don't see him as a dumb man. I see him as a man who was raised 
in a shack and not allowed to leave the house and not allowed to socialize. 
So he's just a little socially inept. Born from a "Saturday night 
live" character named canteen boy, adam Sandler's latest lovable zhlub 
learns how to tackle his fears after he meets a confused coach Klein, 
played by Henry winkler. This is good. This is much better than what 
I serve. My team has not won for five years in a row. And Adam comes 
along and I see the potential. One potential stumbling block is Bobby's 
mamma. You see, my boy is too delicate to be playing foosball and 
whatever you call it. When Kathy Bates isn't serving up swamp fixin's 
or chewing the scenery, she's chewing out Bobby's would-be girlfriend. 
Well, did he tell you about how much his feet smell? Mama! On set, 
"the waterboy" scored big with the bewitching Fairuza balk. I think 
he's hilarious. I think he's really talented. He's very dedicated. 
He's very professional. And he's really good to work with. His former 
nyu roommate, Frank corraci, who directed Sandler's hit film, "the 
wedding singer," directs this one as well. I got a cool -- I get to 
work with my buddies. And what could be cooler than working with fonzie? 
That is undeniable. There's nobody who goes, "no, I wasn't a fonzie 
fan." Everybody's like, "yes!" I grew up watching him in "happy days." 
So, it's amazing. You know, the fonz, the guy who can click and everything 
works. You know, "heyyy." It's like you -- everyone in the world wanted 
to be that cool, you know? And so what if Bobby Boucher isn't that 
cool. With a little help from his friends, he can still make a splash. 
Water boy water gives you strength. It's clean. It's cold. It's high 
quality H 2 O. It's cold and it's clean. It is imperative that you 
allow me to be your water boy. Bill Tush, "CNN Entertainment News," 
New York.
