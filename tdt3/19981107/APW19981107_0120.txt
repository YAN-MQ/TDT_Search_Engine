Kuwait has decided to buy U.S.-made howitzers, the U.S. ambassador 
announced Saturday, confirming a controversial deal for 48 cannons 
that many lawmakers say are unsuitable for the emirate's tiny army. 
Ambassador James Larocco said the Paladin M-109, 155mm self-propelled 
artillery pieces will be custom built for Kuwait by a U.S. firm, United 
Defense, over the next several years. He gave no details but the Pentagon 
had said previously that Kuwait was planning to buy 48 howitzers for 
about dlrs 496 million. The guns will have a 52-caliber barrel with 
a range of 40 kilometers (25 miles), and will employ the U.S. Army's 
most advanced fire control system, Larocco said in a statement. Howitzers 
are short cannons, larger than mortars, and fire shells in a high 
arc. The Paladin howitzers will be ``updated to respond to (Kuwait's) 
unique requirements,'' Larocco's statement said without elaborating. 
A number of lawmakers in Kuwait's 50-seat parliament believe the government 
has disregarded expert opinion that the guns were unsuitable for Kuwait's 
armed forces. It is not known what the experts have said about the 
guns and the lawmakers have not elaborated. Legislator Mubarak al-Duwailah, 
a Muslim fundamentalist, has also accused the defense ministry of 
wasting public money on the deal to please the United States, Kuwait's 
main Gulf War ally. Shortly after the 1991 war that ended a seven-month 
Iraqi occupation of this Gulf country, Kuwait signed a 10-year defense 
agreement with Washington. The pact calls for weapons purchases and 
continuous war games. Kuwait signed similar agreements with its other 
allies, Britain, France and Russia. It has been rebuilding its small 
armed forces that was shattered by the Iraqi occupation.
