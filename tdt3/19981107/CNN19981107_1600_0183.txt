Now that Gingrich is leaving, what does the future hold for the republican 
party? Kelli Arena reports. It's a party at a crossroads, facing a 
choice -- go the way of gOP governors who call for compassionate, 
practical conservatism, or follow those who are strict social and 
ideological conservatives. A party in search of a message and a messenger. 
Republicans had a very bad year. They had a very bad two or three 
years. We had a great 1995, and after the government shutdown, we 
have been in disarray ever since. Republican roots run deep -- tax 
cuts, smaller government, education reform, fixing social security. 
But the democrats have coopted some of these, and GOP factions fight 
over others. My sense is you're gonna have a very difficult two years 
under any circumstance. If the republicans are not united, we get 
blown away. Too many times, legislation has passed the republican 
house, only to fail in the republican Senate. The republican conference 
does have some ideological differences, but they also agree on about 
90% of the basic tenets. Move on those. Focus on those. Talk about 
those. Unite the party. And basically, unite the rest of the country 
around those issues, and then you have a winning formula for the year 
2000. Reconciliation will take time. The party needs a good salesman. 
As yet, no obvious candidate. One insider says it will be a dogfight. 
They're gonna be looking for people who can communicate, who can explain 
on shows like this why the republican agenda's superior. Senior GOP 
officials call it "conservatism with a smile." Just not this smile.
