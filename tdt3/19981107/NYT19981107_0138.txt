Ever since they flocked to a preview of the movie that has the same 
name as their hometown, Pleasantville's citizens have been self-consciously 
comparing notes on what about their village is the same as the movie's 
darkly comic locale and what is different. Sure, life in the cinematic 
Pleasantville is as pretty and trouble-free as it was in ``Father 
Knows Best.'' Dad returns from work shouting, ``Honey, I'm home!'' 
and inevitably sniffs a meatloaf baked by his prim, stay-at-home wife. 
The high school basketball players never miss a shot. But the film 
is an urban cynic's vision and clearly means to expose the sinister 
underside of idyllic places like the real Pleasantville. The two modern-day 
teen-agers thrust into the movie's black-and-white 1950s sitcom soon 
uncover the sexual and artistic longings that have been dampened to 
keep life tidy. When they challenge the prevailing order, they unleash 
the fascism lurking in the village's soul, setting off book burnings 
reminiscent of the Nazis'. The real Pleasantville's residents are 
tickled by the attention the movie is bringing them, but they say 
life here is not all black and white and bland, nor is it festering 
with unspoken tensions. ``At the soccer game the other day, a lot 
of women said they couldn't remember the last time they made a stack 
of pancakes for their kids like the mom does in the movie,'' said 
Carol Greenman, owner of the village's bookshop, which features a 
window display about the movie. Pleasantville women these days make 
the 50-minute commute to New York, where their jobs give them a regular 
dose of big-city rough and tumble. Rather than burning books, Pleasantville 
High School requires students to read ``The Catcher in the Rye.'' 
This village of 6,500 prides itself on its Quaker-nourished tolerance. 
It has two group homes for troubled children. The Jewish population 
here has grown large enough to open a synagogue. Only 126 blacks were 
counted in the 1990 census, but people blame the homogeneity on the 
high cost of housing. Mayor John Nonna said that if Pleasantville 
ever had a Panglossian mind-set, it was eroded by Vietnam, Watergate 
and the Internet. ``It's nice to have a perfect village, but as the 
movie points out, you can't be too perfect,'' he said. ``You've got 
to change and be open to new ideas.'' What may make Pleasantvillians 
uncomfortable is that the wholesomeness satirized in the movie is 
quite true of this close-knit village. Most children walk to school, 
allowing families to cross paths and get to know one another. When 
high school students mount their annual musical, 100 parents pitch 
in to hammer sets and sew costumes. When students graduate, the whole 
town shows up, dogs included. That neighborliness has a price, said 
Iliana Korin, a Brazil-bred psychologist, who cherishes her 18 years 
here. ``You can't be so open and allow much of the outside influences 
in,'' she said. ``You lose some diversity and intellectual stimulation.'' 
And Donald Antonecchia, the schools superintendent, said that such 
close ties mean that ``if a student is suspended, there's a good chance 
everyone knows about it at every dinner table.'' He was thankful for 
the town's geniality when his nephew, Richard Modica, a Princeton 
sophomore who had starred in high school musicals, was killed by a 
drunken driver in Florida, and residents gathered round to console 
his family. Three years ago, someone destroyed the downtown Hanukkah 
menorah and deposited it on the lawn of a Jewish village trustee. 
So as a point of civic principle, villagers arranged to get another 
menorah, and 200 people, Christians and Jews, turned out to see the 
eighth night's lighting. It's supposed to be sophisticated to see 
all this as saccharine _ as ``Leave it to Beaver.'' But many Pleasantville 
youngsters who thirst to escape find that when they grow up, they 
want to return to places like Pleasantville. ``The small, tight-knit 
community really grounds you,'' said Meaghan Harrigan, a 17-year-old 
senior. ``It's nice to know when I'll be coming back from college 
I'll see everybody and they'll know it's me.''
