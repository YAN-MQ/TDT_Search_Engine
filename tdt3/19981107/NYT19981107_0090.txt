Shortly before noon Friday, a visitor to Yankee Stadium did a double-take. 
Walking through the press gate in a Detroit Tigers' uniform, his spikes 
clacking on the sidewalk, was a familiar face. Kevin Costner. ``He's 
making a movie here,'' a Yankee employee explained. ``He's been here 
two weeks. He's got another four to go.'' Inside, several dozen people 
had gathered near cameras under an awning in deep left field. Others 
were on the grass near the pitcher's mound. Perched in some of the 
empty seats behind home plate were wooden cutouts of spectators. On 
the scoreboard, the Tigers were playing the Yankees. ``He's a Tigers' 
pitcher who's got a perfect game going,'' the Yankee employee said. 
But what, the visitor wanted to know, is the name of this movie that 
is being filmed in the House of the World Series champions? ``The 
movie,'' the Yankee employee said, ``is `For the Love of the Game.''' 
It must be a fictional movie, maybe a romantic comedy. With that title, 
it couldn't be a true story, especially if it's being filmed in November 
when baseball's free-agent auctions have begun, when negotiations 
are under way for millions of dollars. Not for the love of the game. 
Nowhere was the absence of the love of the game more obvious than 
in the office of Brian Cashman, the Yankee general manager. When a 
voice told Cashman that ``Mr. Steinbrenner is on the phone,'' he took 
the call. Instantly. It is doubtful that the love of the game was 
about to be discussed. Much more likely, the principal owner was talking 
about what to do about Bernie Williams, David Cone and Darryl Strawberry. 
Should the Yankees match what could be a seven-year, $100 million 
offer for their center fielder? Should they eliminate the 200-innings 
clause from their ace right-hander's next contract? Should they exercise 
the $2.5 million option for 1999 on the slugger recuperating from 
colon-cancer surgery? As a public service for the principal owner, 
the answers here would be: yes, yes and no. As expensive as Williams 
is expected to be, if the Yankees don't keep him, they can't replace 
him. He is not only their cleanup hitter and reigning American League 
batting champion, he not only has a smooth, serene personality that 
is comfortable in the New York scene, he is also their center fielder. 
Center fielders who can hit, run and throw are hard to find. And center 
fielders who are comfortable in a Yankee uniform might be even harder 
to find. Except for Ken Griffey Jr., Williams is baseball's best center 
fielder. If the Yankees lose him, sure, somebody else in a Yankee 
uniform will be playing center field next season, but that center 
fielder won't be hitting cleanup, that center fielder won't win the 
AL batting title. As expensive as $100 million over seven years for 
Williams sounds now, that price is merely the next step in the free-agent 
fiscal ladder now that the Mets gave Mike Piazza $91 million for seven 
years. If the Yankees were to pursue Griffey eventually, it would 
cost more than $100 million. In the long run, signing the 30-year-old 
Williams now would be a bargain. Cone apparently isn't arguing about 
money. In pitching more than 200 innings, he qualified for a $5.5 
million salary next season when he will be 36 years old; the Yankees 
reportedly have offered $7 million. But he doesn't want to have to 
pitch 200 innings to qualify for a contract in 2000. Cone isn't demanding 
extravagant money. In his two previous free-agent situations, Cone 
hit the lottery for $37.5 million over six years _ $18 million with 
Kansas City, $19.5 million with the Yankees. He doesn't need money; 
he needs a rested arm. As good as David Wells, Andy Pettitte and Orlando 
Hernandez are, Cone remains Joe Torre's favorite choice for a big 
game. That type of trustworthy pitcher is rare. Don't make Cone force 
himself to pitch 200 innings. All that does is put an added burden 
on an arm that should be nourished. Strawberry's future involves his 
health. He will not only be 37 when next season starts, he will also 
be coming off cancer surgery and chemotherapy treatments. Strawberry, 
who hit 24 homers last season in earning $750,000 in salary and $175,000 
in incentives, is hoping that Steinbrenner will pick up the option 
for a $2.5 million salary next year, as opposed to a $100,000 buyout. 
But the principal owner is reluctant, quite understandably. Who knows 
if Strawberry will play again? Or if he does play, how well he will 
play? Considering Strawberry's illness, that sounds harsh. But other 
than Steinbrenner's promise to always ``take care'' of Strawberry, 
the principal owner isn't responsible for Strawberry, especially not 
for his reported $2.5 million tax debt. He can ``take care'' of Strawberry 
other ways. In baseball now, especially in November, for the love 
of the game is just a movie.
