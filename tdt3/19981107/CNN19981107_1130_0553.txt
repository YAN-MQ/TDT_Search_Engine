Sad news for animal lovers. Ruby the painting elephant was euthanized 
during surgery yesterday at the phoenix zoo. Vets operated on her 
after a failed pregnancy and discovered she was suffering from a fatal 
infection. Hundreds of zoo visitors held a candlelight vigil for ruby. 
The elephant's abstract art raised about $500,000 for the zoo.
