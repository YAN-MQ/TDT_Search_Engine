Voters in Sao Tome and Principe go to the polls Sunday in a general 
election that has focused on the tiny West African island nation's 
deep economic woes. Eight political parties are taking part in the 
ballot for 55 parliamentary seats. Campaigning has been dominated 
by the two major parties, which are close to President Miguel Trovoada 
and former president Manuel Pinto da Costa, the twin-island nation's 
main political figures and serious rivals. The six smaller parties 
have little cash for campaigning, leaving the way clear for Pinto 
da Costa's governing Sao Tome and Principe Liberation Movement/Social 
Democratic Party and Trovoada's Independent Democratic Alliance. Both 
parties have campaigned on a centrist platform with pledges to relaunch 
stagnant economic growth in the impoverished country of 120,000 people. 
The government's inability to improve living conditions means the 
approximately 49,600 registered voters across seven districts are 
expected to favor the IDA. Final results are expected Monday. The 
unemployment rate hovers round 45 percent. The average salary is about 
dlrs 220 per year, while a pair of shoes costs dlrs 50. The economic 
troubles have sparked social unrest, including strikes by teachers, 
health workers and other state employees over the past year. An aborted 
military coup in August 1995 led to the formation four months later 
of a coalition government which has been in power since then. The 
economy relies largely on the export of tropical produce, particularly 
cocoa, but the discovery earlier this year of oil in the country's 
waters could remedy the economic ills and help pay off foreign debt 
estimated at some dlrs 300 million. Sao Tome and Principe lies in 
the Gulf of Guinea, about 150 miles (240 km) west of Gabon, which 
is one of the most active oil exploration areas in the African continent.
