Soon after dawn each day, the promenade that runs along the shore 
of the Caspian Sea fills with Americans and other expatriates out 
for a morning run. Many of them are Texas oilmen, and after dark they 
congregate at Margaritaville, a Tex-Mex restaurant that features tacos, 
enchiladas and refried beans. Gas executives from Louisiana prefer 
the jambalaya and gumbo at another favorite haunt, the Ragin' Cajun. 
Later, some join the newly rich Azerbaijanis who pack glittery local 
discos. Once a distant and sleepy outpost of the Soviet Union, Baku 
is a boom town where the scent of big money hangs in the air. Huge 
amounts of oil and gas are believed to lie beneath the Caspian, and 
three new nations that share its shoreline _ Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan 
and Turkmenistan _ stand to reap billions of dollars from what looks 
like the century's last big bonanza. Because the Caspian region is 
landlocked, however, pipelines must be built to carry its oil to world 
markets. Oil companies are soon to announce which route they prefer 
for their main export pipeline from Baku. Many nations, including 
the United States, believe the decision will have profound economic 
and geopolitical consequences, and are lobbying intensely for their 
favored routes. At stake is far more than the fate of the complex 
Caspian region itself. Rivalries being played out here will have a 
decisive impact in shaping the post-communist world, and in determining 
how much influence the United States will have over its development. 
``This is about America's energy security, which depends on diversifying 
our sources of oil and gas worldwide,'' said Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson, who has put Caspian issues among his key priorities. ``It's 
also about preventing strategic inroads by those who don't share our 
values.'' ``We're trying to move these newly independent countries 
toward the West,'' Richardson added. ``We would like to see them reliant 
on Western commercial and political interests rather than going another 
way. We've made a substantial political investment in the Caspian, 
and it's very important to us that both the pipeline map and the politics 
come out right.'' The Clinton administration is making a final effort 
to persuade oil companies that they should build their pipeline across 
Georgia and Turkey, a route that would promote U.S. interests in the 
region. Russia and Iran are pushing routes of their own, and urging 
the companies not to commit themselves to the U.S.-backed one. Oil 
executives must weigh pressure from Washington against a backdrop 
of low oil prices and the worldwide economic downturn. In this climate 
they are reluctant to commit themselves to multibillion-dollar investments 
_ especially, perhaps, the U.S.-backed proposal, which oil companies 
estimate will cost $4 billion. This is roughly double the estimate 
for the other plans, which involve shorter distances. Lands around 
the Caspian have been political and military battlegrounds almost 
since the dawn of history. The Persian, Russian, Ottoman and British 
empires sacrificed countless lives and enormous amounts of treasure 
to secure them. History's most ambitious conquerors, from Genghis 
Khan and Tamerlane to Peter the Great and Hitler, waged campaigns 
here. Early visitors to this region recorded their amazement at the 
gaseous ``pillars of fire'' that rose from many meadows, and at the 
black goo that spilled from the ground. The 13th-century adventurer 
Marco Polo wrote that the goo, which we now call crude oil, was inedible 
but ``good for burning.'' The very name Azerbaijan comes from an ancient 
Persian word meaning ``garden of fire.'' Azerbaijan has already lived 
through one oil boom. It reached its peak a century ago, led by pioneers 
with names like Nobel, Rothschild and Rockefeller. Many of the Azerbaijanis 
who made fortunes in that boom built elegant baroque and neoclassical 
mansions in downtown Baku, and they stand today as links to a fabled 
past. For most of this century, only two states bordered on the Caspian 
Sea: the Soviet Union and Iran. Both had vast energy reserves in other 
places, and neither paid much attention to those under and around 
the Caspian. In the early 1990s, however, the political geography 
of the region changed radically. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan 
emerged from the debris of the Soviet Union. All three have come to 
realize that they control enough oil and gas to make them fabulously 
rich. Hoping to share in that wealth, energy companies from nearly 
40 nations have descended on the Caspian. William Courtney, a senior 
State Department official and former ambassador to Kazakhstan and 
Georgia, has estimated that by 2010, foreign companies will invest 
as much as $50 billion in Caspian oil fields alone, not counting the 
billions they will spend to develop gas fields and build pipelines. 
The sight of well-dressed young Azerbaijanis stepping from shiny Mercedes 
sedans and nodding at their bodyguards as they whisper into cell phones 
no longer attracts attention here. Nor do reports that one or another 
local ``oil shark'' has bought or ordered a lavish estate and paid 
for it with suitcases full of hundred-dollar bills. Clever entrepreneurs 
have already made millions of dollars from the oil boom, and that 
is nothing compared to what may lie ahead. From their offices here, 
oil executives can gaze out at a sea dotted by oil platforms. But 
it is on the streets of Baku that the effect of the boom is most palpable. 
New restaurants and bars seem to open every week, some bearing names 
like Manhattan and Shangri-La. Bewildered pensioners, survivors from 
another age, wander past them begging for coins. ``It's not often 
that a whole region like this becomes available,'' said Igor Effimov, 
who directs Pennzoil's operation here from an office near the ancient 
city wall. ``Let's guess that the market price for oil stays where 
it is now, about $15 a barrel,'' Effimov said. ``Subtract about $5 
a barrel for operating costs, transportation and taxes,'' he added. 
``What you're left with, the amount of money that is going to hit 
this country could easily be $50 billion to $100 billion or more. 
You and I will both be dead by the time all that money finishes flowing 
in, but it is just a mind-boggling number.'' Before anyone can begin 
making these fortunes from Caspian oil, however, a decision must be 
made about where to lay the main export pipeline. Under a 1994 contract 
between Azerbaijan and 11 foreign oil companies _ among them Pennzoil, 
Exxon and Amoco _ the companies will recommend rather than dictate 
a pipeline location to the Azerbaijani government. But since they 
will pay for whatever pipeline is built, their recommendation carries 
great weight. The Clinton administration is fervently promoting a 
route that runs from Baku through Georgia and Turkey to the Mediterranean. 
At a port near the Turkish town of Ceyhan (pronounced JAY-han), the 
oil would be loaded onto tankers for shipment to European markets. 
This Baku-Ceyhan route fulfills every U.S. condition. It passes through 
only countries friendly to the United States _ Azerbaijan, Georgia 
and Turkey _ and avoids both Russia and Iran. It would also pull the 
Caspian region away from Russia's shadow and toward the West. Leaders 
of Caspian nations met in Turkey on Oct. 29 and signed a declaration 
favoring the U.S.-backed route. But they did not offer any financial 
support to reduce its $4 billion estimated cost. The Clinton administration 
has told oil companies that for political reasons it cannot give them 
large subsidies to build the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline. Instead it is pressing 
Turkey to do so. Turkish leaders are reportedly open to the idea because 
they badly want the pipeline, but have not yet produced a package 
of incentives. Clinton's special envoy to the Caspian countries, Richard 
Morningstar, is working to persuade Turkey to improve its offer, and 
says he believes Turkish officials are responding. For half the estimated 
cost of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, however, oil companies might build 
a line either southward through Iran to the Persian Gulf or northward 
to the Russian port of Novorossisk on the Black Sea. A route to Georgia's 
Black Sea port of Supsa is shorter and would be even cheaper. ``Pipelines 
are supposed to be built for commercial reasons, not political reasons,'' 
said Robert Ebel, an energy specialist at the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies in Washington. ``The plan to build through 
Turkey emerged as a way to help Turkey, and because our government 
doesn't want a pipeline through Iran. But that doesn't put the project 
on a paying basis.'' This attitude, which is widespread in the oil 
business, drives some U.S. officials to distraction. They are deeply 
convinced that building a pipeline from Baku to Ceyhan is vital to 
the United States' long-term security. Oil executives, however, stubbornly 
insist on their right to choose the cheapest alternative. Chevron 
Overseas Petroleum president Richard Matzke said the Baku-Ceyhan option 
favored by the United States ``probably isn't the most rational solution 
at the moment,'' and other oil executives agree. As a result, some 
administration officials have privately concluded that the Baku-Ceyhan 
line is not going to be built in the next few years. They believe 
the oil companies are preparing to announce that they will build a 
line only as far as Georgia, leaving open the possibility of a future 
extension to Ceyhan. The Clinton administration is preparing to portray 
the decision for Georgia as a victory, on the grounds that the pipeline 
will be built along an ``east-west axis'' rather than north through 
Russia or south through Iran. And Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott asserted recently that ``an obituary for the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline 
is at least premature and, we believe, wrong and inaccurate.'' If 
oil companies announce that they will only build a pipeline as far 
as Georgia's Black Sea coast, they must decide what to do with the 
oil once it reaches there. The only maritime route out of the Black 
Sea is through the Bosporus, which runs through the center of Istanbul 
and is already so crowded that the Turkish government has announced 
plans to limit its ship traffic. Officials in Bulgaria, Romania and 
Ukraine say they have the ideal alternative. They want to receive 
Caspian oil at ports on the western shore of the Black Sea, and then 
send it to European markets on barges or through existing pipelines. 
But U.S. officials scoff at these proposals. ``We don't see them as 
practical and we don't see who would finance them,'' said a White 
House aide. ``Baku-Ceyhan is the way to go.'' Estimates of how much 
oil and gas lie in the Caspian region vary widely, often according 
to results of the most recent test drillings. A few dry holes were 
hit last summer, and several tracts in the Azerbaijani sector turned 
out to contain gas instead of oil. That news, together with low oil 
prices and the Asian financial crisis, has calmed the frenzy in Baku 
a bit. ``There's a very interesting split of oil people on one hand 
and geopoliticians on the other,'' said Thane Gustafson, a Washington-based 
energy consultant. ``The geopoliticians are still breathing heavily, 
but for the oil people it's more like a sigh.'' For the new Caspian 
nations, the prospect of riches remains very real. Their energy reserves 
are valued in the hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. 
Without doubt they have more oil than Alaska, probably at least as 
much as the North Sea and possibly half as much as Saudi Arabia. ``Estimates 
range from 20 to 200 billion barrels,'' said Paul Millar, a British 
government official who monitors developments in the Caspian. ``The 
true figure is more likely somewhere in between, but it is a brave 
person that approaches their bank or shareholders for funding on a 
market estimate that could vary by plus or minus 90 percent.'' This 
uncertainty has made oil companies reluctant to support multibillion-dollar 
pipeline projects like the one Washington is backing. But even if 
the Caspian region turns out only to have as much oil as pessimists 
believe, its strategic importance is all but guaranteed. ``This is 
not really about oil,'' said Julia Nanay, a Washington-based consultant 
who works with oil companies active in the Caspian. ``It's about defense 
politics and world strategy. Whether you're talking about containing 
Russian influence or helping Turkey or containing Iran or building 
up new states in the region, oil is just a political cover.'' ``New 
oil is being found in Mexico, Venezuela, West Africa and other places,'' 
she added, ``but it isn't getting the same attention, because you 
don't have these huge strategic rivalries. There is no other place 
in the world where so many people and countries and companies are 
competing.''
