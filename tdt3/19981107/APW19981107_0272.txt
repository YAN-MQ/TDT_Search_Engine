Police searched a private American school in south Moravia on Friday, 
acting on suspicions that educational methods there are too harsh, 
the school's secretary said Saturday. Martina Krystofova said police 
searched the school's premises Friday afternoon and took some of the 
students out for interviews. More interviews will follow, she said. 
Nobody was immediately available for comment at police headquarters 
in Brno, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Prague. The regions 
of Bohemia and Moravia make up the territory of the Czech Republic. 
The police search came only three days after media reported that the 
Brno school in fact was a correction facility for American teenagers 
with behavior problems. Based on information from unnamed former employees 
of the school, media said that the children were being inadequately 
punished and were forbidden to leave the premises. Martin Pilka, the 
co-owner of Morava Academy agency that runs the school, told The Associated 
Press earlier this week that the school is a regular boarding school 
for American teenagers who at home were neglecting school and also 
had problems to get along with their families. He ruled out any harsh 
methods, saying the children were being regularly taken out for walks 
and excursions. Pilka said that the school has 60 students age 15-18. 
The first students arrived in Brno in March. The course takes 8 to 
10 months, he said. But he claimed the school is accepted in the United 
States as part of the U.S. educational system. Pilka explained it 
is part of a broader project including twelve similar institutions 
in different parts of the world. ``Mr. Atkin likes it here and wanted 
the children to get to know Europe, that's why he opted for the Czech 
Republic,'' Pilka said. Ralph Atkin from St. George, Utah, is the 
majority owner of Morava Academy, according to Pilka, who holds the 
minority share. According to private NOVA television, parents pay 
dlrs 80 per day for each kid. The U.S. Embassy in Prague said they 
are aware of the school's existence here but have no legal means to 
check a private institution. The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said Saturday 
that representatives of a non-governmental Fund for Children in Danger 
also visited the school but found no evidence for the allegations.
