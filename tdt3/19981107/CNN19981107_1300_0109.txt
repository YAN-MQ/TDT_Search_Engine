"The ultimate victory" for democrats and the White House. That's how 
one republican describes the decision by Newt Gingrich to step down 
as speaker of the house. He also plans to give up his congressional 
seat as well. In a statement released yesterday, Gingrich said -- 
And I think that the statesmanlike manner in which Newt Gingrich put 
the interests of the nation and his party ahead of his own personal 
interests is to be commended. You know, Newt Gingrich is the man that 
gave us the first balanced budget in 30 years, who changed welfare 
into workfair, who brought us the first tax relief package in 16 years. 
He's to be honored by the republican party, and by the American people 
for his service to the nation and for bringing us to the majority.
