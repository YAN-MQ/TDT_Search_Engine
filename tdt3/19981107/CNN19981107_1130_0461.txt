This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast." Later today, into Sunday evening an area of low pressure 
pushes through the plains states toward the Ohio river valley bringing 
some snow. In fact a few inches to Nebraska and Iowa. We'll see some 
showers and storms through the central and southern plains states. 
A mix of rain and snow, just light, across the Great Lakes. A big 
storm in the western U.S. will keep it wet and windy with some heavy 
accumulations of mountain snow. Highs today just 20s and 30s over 
the northern plains. We will see some 60s and 70s in the far south. 
Looking ahead to Monday, it looks like everybody sees rain or snow 
with the coldest air over the northern Rockies. Then on Tuesday, heaviest 
rain is across the Great Lakes, although it is warming up to the 40s 
and 50s. For Wednesday it will be wet on the east coast and in the 
northwest with some mountain snow. Temperatures will range from 30s 
north to 70s across the south. Didn't forget, you can find four day 
forecast for 7200 cities at CNN.com.
