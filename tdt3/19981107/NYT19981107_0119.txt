Their wish finally came true: Democrats helped topple House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich. But rather than celebrate, many of Gingrich's toughest 
foes are now lamenting the loss of the politician they most liked 
to demonize. ``We won't have Newt to kick around any more _ and we'll 
miss him,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a Democratic media consultant. ``In 
the way the Republican Party spent years using Ted Kennedy as their 
punching bag _ and made millions in direct mail off him _ I don't 
think we've ever had a better villain than Newt.'' Hours before Gingrich's 
decision to step aside was announced Friday, Saul Shorr, a Democratic 
commercial creator who featured the speaker in a recent advertisement 
in a House race in Seattle, said he told a colleague that he hoped 
Gingrich would survive. ``You only get to make a first impression 
once,'' Shorr said, ``and the first impression he made on the American 
public was entirely negative.'' Just as many Republicans did not want 
President Clinton to resign _ they preferred a wounded president over 
Vice President Al Gore in the top spot in the run-up to the 2000 campaign 
_ Democrats are ambivalent about Gingrich walking off the political 
stage. Not even Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the arch-enemy of liberals 
for decades, could generate as much vitriol _ or fund-raising dollars 
on either side _ as Gingrich. Told on Friday night of Gingrich's decision, 
Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Republican, described him as a leader 
who was ``either loved or hated.'' To many, it was more the latter. 
A New York Times/CBS News Poll taken several days before Tuesday's 
election found that the speaker's popularity was continuing to erode: 
His positive rating stood at 18 percent; his negative rating was 43 
percent. Gingrich was so popular among Democrats because all they 
had to do was flash his picture (usually in blurry black and white) 
in a television commercial or inject his name in a partisan speech 
or a fund-raising appeal, and it was instant shorthand for depicting 
Republicans as dangerous extremists. In the 1996 presidential campaign, 
the Democratic Party pumped millions of dollars into commercials tying 
Republican nominee Bob Dole to Gingrich. ``They really weren't even 
that creative,'' Ms. Grunwald said of the spots. They did not have 
to be. All the commercial creators needed was an image that people 
could grasp in a split second. It was enough to drive Dole campaign 
officials to complain publicly, as Scott Reed, his campaign manager, 
did two weeks before the 1996 election, saying, ``Bill Clinton has 
spent $45 million on misleading and false advertising linking Dole 
to Gingrich.'' Dan Carroll, who in the 1992 campaign was in charge 
of opposition research for the Democratic Party, said that until Gingrich 
led Republicans to retake Congress in 1994, Democrats never could 
find just the right villain. In fact, polls show that most other Republican 
leaders are virtual strangers to the public. ``It was hard for him 
to pretend to be a happy-faced conservative,'' Carroll said. Gingrich's 
swift emergence as an irresistible foe occurred because of a confluence 
of events: He became a household name because of his triumph leading 
the Republicans to seize the House in 1994, for the first time in 
40 years. But a year or two later, when Americans began souring on 
the new Congress, Gingrich was seen as the embodiment of the party. 
In interviews around the country, particularly in the 1996 campaign, 
ordinary voters would literally recoil at the mere mention of the 
speaker. ``He was easy to caricature,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican 
strategist in San Francisco. ``The same things that made him an effective 
leader made him an easy target: He was loud. He was outrageous. And 
he always pushed the envelope further than anyone thought he could 
_ or should _ push it.'' Andrei Cherny, a former senior speech writer 
for Gore, said the loss of Gingrich as a pinata was ``a sad day for 
Democrats.'' It was with relish, he said, that he would lace Gore's 
speeches with references to the speaker. ``Newt Gingrich was a two-word 
explanation for Republican intransigency and extremism and I took 
advantage of it,'' said Cherny, the editor of Blueprint, a new magazine 
about centrist Democrats. ``Every time he was the voice of the Republican 
agenda it made the Democratic arguments that much easier.'' This year, 
when many campaigns turned on local matters, Democrats were less enchanted 
with featuring the speaker. But in the closing weeks some Democrats 
again pulled out their not-so-secret weapon. In his last speech of 
the campaign, in Baltimore, Clinton urged Democrats to vote, declaring, 
``Your vote counts just as much as mine, just as much as Speaker Gingrich's.'' 
Shorr produced a commercial for Jay Inslee, a Democrat who ran for 
the House in California (and unseated Rep. Rick White) that criticized 
Republicans for prolonging the scandal. ``Rick White and Newt Gingrich 
shouldn't be dragging us through this,'' Inslee said in the 30-second 
commercial. And Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., broadcast a commercial 
in the closing days that linked her Republican rival, Matt Fong, to 
Gingrich, portraying both men as extreme opponents of abortion. She 
was re-elected. Some Democrats, however, who were daunted by Gingrich's 
political skills, said they were thrilled that he is quitting. With 
Gingrich no threat, many of these Democrats were more praiseworthy 
of the speaker's talents than some in his own party. ``I'm glad he's 
gone _ he was such a formidable adversary,'' said William Carrick, 
a Democratic consultant in Los Angeles. ``He's probably one of the 
best fund-raisers that's ever been involved in American electoral 
politics. He's the only one of them who had real strategic vision.'' 
Paul Begala, a senior White House official, said Gingrich had ``a 
rare intellectual gift for articulating his views.'' But he said Gingrich's 
successor, whomever that might be, could well end up just as disliked. 
He argued that the speaker's unpopularity was not personal but based 
on his agenda. ``I really believe that American politics is not a 
cult of personality,'' Begala said. ``People like us or dislike us 
based on our ideas or issues.'' Steve Elmendorf, chief of staff to 
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said he was not mourning the loss 
of a political foil. ``Turmoil is helpful to us,'' he said of the 
Republican's intramural fight. ``We have an agenda and we're ready 
to go. And unless they change their agenda direction, they'll have 
another Speaker who will become equally unpopular.'' But politicians 
who are as unpopular as Gingrich do not come around that often. ``They 
spent tens of millions of dollars demonizing Gingrich,'' Schnur said. 
``That's all money down the drain. Now they have to start over with 
the next guy.''
