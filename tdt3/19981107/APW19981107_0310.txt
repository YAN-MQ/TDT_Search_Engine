Ethiopia's prime minister arrived for peace talks Saturday with a 
warning that a six-month border feud with neighboring Eritrea will 
continue unless Eritrea withdraws from disputed territory. Prime Minister 
Meles Zenawi said Ethiopia was hoping for peace but prepared for a 
prolonged frontier squabble. ``I'm coming here seeking peace and justice. 
I wouldn't be here if I had no hope of it succeeding,'' Meles said. 
``But the underlying problem has not been resolved and that is Eritrea 
has invaded part of our territory and occupied it. Until it has been 
resolved, one cannot expect complete tranquility.'' Meles was scheduled 
Saturday to meet in Burkina Faso's capital with a mediation committee 
appointed by the Organization of African Unity. Eritrea's President 
Isaias Afwerki was also due to arrive later in the day for separate 
talks with the committee, which has developed a list of peace proposals. 
Direct meetings between the rivals have not been scheduled and Meles 
deflected questions of whether he was willing to speak face-to-face 
with his counterpart. Meetings are expected to continue on Sunday. 
The committee comprises Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore, Zimbabwean 
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Djibouti's President Hassan 
Ghouled Aptidon. OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim has also 
arrived for the meetings as has U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun. 
Mediation efforts so far have failed to resolve the dispute. Ethiopian 
officials have said they are committed to a U.S.-Rwanda peace proposal 
forwarded earlier this year, which requires that both sides withdraw 
to positions held before hostilities broke out in May. Eritrea, however, 
has rejected that proposal. Isaias, speaking Thursday before departing 
for the talks, said the only way to end the conflict was to declare 
a ceasefire and then demarcate the common border. After a lull in 
fighting between the two Horn of Africa nations, sporadic fighting 
erupted over the past two weeks. Earlier this week, two Ethiopian 
towns were reportedly shelled, with at least nine people killed in 
one of them. Several hundred people have been killed during the six 
months of the dispute. Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia 
and was granted independence in 1993, but the border between the two 
countries has never been officially demarcated.
