Newt Gingrich may have emerged the biggest loser in Tuesday's election, 
but Washington's political pundits are running a close second, many 
of them having predicted since late January that the American public 
would sooner or later turn on President Clinton. The analysts, commentators 
and reporter-prognosticators, who have become a ubiquitous feature 
of the news media landscape, almost without exception predicted wrongly 
that the Republicans would come through the election with a tighter 
grip on Congress (and, by implication, on Clinton's fate). ``We were 
all wrong, all the time,'' said George Stephanopoulos, the ABC commentator 
and former aide to Clinton. ``It's true and we probably ought to admit 
it.'' He said the commentators consistently misread ``the public feeling 
on the entire issue of Monica and impeachment.'' Tony Blankley, a 
former press secretary to Gingrich, said, ``The first thing that has 
to be understood is that pundits are remarkably better at autopsy 
than they are at prophecy. ``We're better at explaining Washington 
to the country than the country to Washington,'' said Blankley, who 
is now editor at large of George magazine and a broadcast pundit on 
shows including ``The McLaughlin Group.'' ``We don't have any greater 
standing than any other reasonably sentient human being on what 270 
million people are going to do about something.'' In interviews Wednesday 
and Thursday, before Gingrich announced that he would resign both 
the speaker's job and his seat in Congress, pundits and former pundits 
attributed the often startling degree of the miscalculations to a 
half-dozen factors including the genuinely surprising outcome of the 
election, the myopia of Washington insiders, and the vested interest 
of journalists in the story. Al Hunt, executive Washington editor 
of The Wall Street Journal and a regular on the CNN talk show ``Capital 
Gang,'' said many in the media failed to grasp the public's acceptance 
of Clinton in part because ``if that was going to be a permanent condition,'' 
then there might be no story to pursue. Stuart Rothenberg, editor 
of The Rothenberg Political Report and a political analyst for CNN, 
said journalists also ignored polls showing no clear evidence that 
the public was turning on Clinton. They did so in part, he said, because 
some themselves felt betrayed and offended by the president's lying. 
And William Kristol, the editor and publisher of The Weekly Standard, 
who had predicted in recent months that both Clinton and the Democrats 
were ``doomed,'' said ruefully, ``I think I'm not as smart as I thought 
I was, or at least as I pretended to think I was. ``Everything these 
days is so over-interpreted and over-explained, it's useful to be 
reminded that these things are hard to predict,'' Kristol said. ``The 
key thing now to remember is that just as one's facile predictions 
were wrong, one's facile explanations after the fact are as likely 
to be wrong.'' And what about the damage done to the pundit class, 
Stephanopoulos was asked. ``Hardy breed,'' he answered. To be sure, 
the pundits' opinions have not been uniform and have shifted over 
time, from the moment in January when Sam Donaldson of ABC News said 
he thought that if Clinton was not telling the truth about his relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky, his presidency would be ``numbered in days.'' 
Back then, pundits could be heard predicting a prolonged impeachment. 
Some said it was not a matter of whether but of when he would be driven 
out. Some forecast imminent resignation. Some said the Democrats wanted 
him out so they could regroup for the midterm elections. When Clinton's 
approval ratings then rose, the pundits regrouped but did not back 
down. ``A year from now, Clinton will be gone,'' Kristol wrote in 
May. When the public understands what Clinton has done, he wrote, 
``then the American people will desert Clinton. Indeed, they will 
turn on him.'' By late August, pundits were predicting disastrous 
results for the Democrats in the November election. In October, Kristol 
wrote, ``After the voting this Nov. 3, the Democrats are likely to 
be down to about 40 senators and fewer than 200 House members, their 
lowest total in 70 years. And the devastation will continue at the 
state and local levels.'' Though many of the pundits modified their 
forecasts late last month, there was nevertheless widespread agreement 
that the Republicans would end up winning seats in both the Senate 
and the House. Mark Shields, who appears on ``Capital Gang,'' was 
one of the relatively few commentators who came close to the truth. 
``There are going to be five or fewer,'' he said on Saturday night. 
``It may even be a wash. You heard it right here.'' ``I was very lucky,'' 
Shields said, sounding like a man who narrowly escaped a freak accident 
that had just swallowed up his friends. ``But I've been wrong enough 
times that I'm not sitting here as any sort of Delphic oracle.'' In 
their defense, pundits pointed out that they were in good company. 
Other people seemed not to have foreseen the outcome of the election 
either. The pundits said they had gotten many things right _ for example, 
the fact that the original charges against Clinton were serious and 
would not go away. They said pundits tended to use history as a guide 
in making predictions; historically, the party in the White House 
has lost an average of 27 seats in midterm elections. In addition, 
some said, they took into account the fact that the Republicans had 
raised far more money. There was, moreover, ``an overwhelming consensus 
amongst party professionals in both parties,'' Blankley said. When 
everyone is relying on data that the parties collect, pundits can 
either rely on that data, too, or go on their own hunches, if they 
have any, which most did not. ``To be fair to my miserable fellow 
pundits, whenever someone would say the Republicans were expecting 
to gain 40 seats in the House, there was usually a pundit to say, 
`Wait a minute,''' Blankley said. ``So there were some minor corrections 
to the more egregious misrepresentations made by others.'' Other pundits 
pointed to other reasons for the miscalculations. Hunt said the public 
long ago ``knew exactly what Clinton was and what he had done'' and 
made judgments that many journalists ``didn't get.'' The public concluded 
that while they might not like or trust Clinton, he was a pretty good 
president and they did not want to impeach him. But members of the 
media did not accept those conclusions. ``Because in a way it ended 
the story,'' Hunt said. ``And a whole lot of people who didn't have 
the advantage of covering Watergate thought this is going to be my 
one and I don't want it to end prematurely.'' Rothenberg said, ``I've 
thought for a while that the public's focus is much more exclusively 
on the state of the economy'' while ``among all members of the media 
there has been greater criticism of the president and a stronger sense 
that, `Gosh, sooner or later the public has got to turn on this guy.''' 
The polls never clearly showed that, Rothenberg said. And many in 
the media have now come to doubt that the public would turn. ``But, 
yeah, there was a sense that this guy had broken a cardinal rule of 
politics, lying to the American public with such intensity and false 
sincerity that sooner or later people were going to judge him on it.'' 
Few people interviewed seemed to think the business of punditry would 
be changed by the election. ``I suppose pundits fight the last war,'' 
said Michael Kinsley, a former Washington pundit who is now the editor 
of the online magazine Slate. ``So the next time one of these things 
comes along, they'll all predict that people will shrug it off. And 
that will be one that people take seriously.''
