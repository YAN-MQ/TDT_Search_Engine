News of the speaker's departure has set off a mad scramble for his 
job. Congressman Bob Livingston of Louisiana was first out of the 
block yesterday. He announced his candidacy several hours before Gingrich 
called it quits. Congressman Christopher Cox of California is also 
in the race. But he's considered a long-shot at this point. Two house 
members are also planning to start a "draft Henry Hyde" movement. 
They're hoping to persuade the Judiciary committee chairman to take 
the speakership. 70-year-old Bill Archer of Texas earlier considered 
running. Today, he announced a more definite political plan.
