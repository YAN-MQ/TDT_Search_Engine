Movie star Leonardo DiCaprio is attracting the wrong kind of attention 
in thailand where he'll be shooting a new movie. He has become the 
target of environmental protesters who say production of the movie, 
"the beach," will destroy the island of phi phi. The leader of the 
protest accuses the movie studio of trying to uproot about 100 previously 
protected coconut palm trees in the national park. "The beach" is 
scheduled to begin production early next year.
