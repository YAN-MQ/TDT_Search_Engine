John Glenn and the crew of the space shuttle "discovery" are preparing 
for their trip back to earth. They were awakened early this morning 
by the song "La cucaracha." It was dedicated to Pedro duque, the first 
Spaniard in space. The shuttle is scheduled to land in about two hours 
at Kennedy space center in Florida. Flight controllers will be paying 
close attention to "discovery's" drag chute. A panel covering the 
chute fell off during take-off last week. It's normally used on landing, 
but is not considered essential equipment.
