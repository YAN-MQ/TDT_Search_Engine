Matt Yallof "CNN Headline Sports." Michigan kept its rose bowl hopes 
alive. Tim Brady threw two TDs where D was stellar once again shutting 
down Penn state 27-0. The first time the nittany lions have been shut 
out since 1987. Talk about did defense, notre dame's line shut down 
in Boston college four times inside the five in the final minutes 
of the Irish' escape from chestnut hill with a win improving to 7-1. 
Wisconsin is 9-0 after beating Minnesota 26-7. Dayne is the first 
Badger with three straight 1,000 yard rushing seasons since 1975.
