Heeding warnings of epidemics of hepatitis, malaria and other diseases, 
Hondurans trying to put their lives back together lined up Saturday 
amid the debris left by Hurricane Mitch for vaccinations. Across flooded 
Central America, health authorities warned that outbreaks of water-related 
diseases such as malaria and cholera could emerge in the week to come. 
To stem a rampage of disease, international relief flights delivered 
the first water purification plants and needed medicines. Dozens of 
taxi drivers took a break from shoveling tons of debris in Tegucigalpa's 
devastated Comayaguela market district to line up for tetanus and 
malaria shots Saturday. Army troops stood watch nearby, wearing face 
masks to ward of the stench of the blocks of muck and garbage, where 
it was feared more bodies were still buried. ``They say there likely 
are more people in there,'' said Felicito Sorido, 51, who with hundreds 
of fellow drivers volunteered for the massive cleanup in hopes of 
reaching their cabs buried several blocks away. Juanita Aleman, 30, 
a health ministry nurse, filled syringes, rolled up the drivers' sleeves 
and administered shots from a small desk on a dusty sidewalk. ``The 
military first asked for these shots for their soldiers,'' she said. 
``Now the taxi drivers. Aside from conjunctivitis there's no epidemic 
yet but we expect it to come.'' Twenty-five case of cholera have been 
reported in Guatemala, the Public Health Ministry there reported Friday. 
The Guatemalan government has increased water-treatment efforts to 
prevent the disease from spreading. Throughout Central America, the 
storm killed an estimated 10,000. More than 6,000 people were killed 
in Honduras by the hurricane and hundreds of thousands were left homeless. 
Each day, dozens more bodies are found throughout the nation, including 
15 in the town of Kabor in western Intibuca province. U.S. Army Secretary 
Louis Caldera inspected storm damage in Honduras and met with President 
Carlos Flores Saturday. He said U.S. soldiers have saved more than 
700 lives in Honduras in rescue missions, using helicopters to pluck 
some victims from rising floodwaters. ``From day ... picks up 11th
