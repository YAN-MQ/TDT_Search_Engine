House republicans will usher in the 106th Congress with a new leader. 
Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich announced his resignation as house 
speaker, and he says he's leaving Congress altogether. Meanwhile, 
CNN has learned house ways and means committee chairman Bill archer 
is pulling himself out of the running for the speaker's post. In a 
conference call to colleagues, Gingrich said his departure is important 
to the future of the GOP. Bob Franken reports. Those who were on his 
conference calls say Gingrich said he began to consider pulling out 
Thursday night. He had been fighting to keep his speaker's job in 
the next Congress. Sources say he was not getting all the commitments 
for support he'd need. All day Friday, he worked the phones. At some 
point, Gingrich was told up to 30 of his fellow republicans would 
refuse to vote for him as speaker. By evening, he had made what he 
called his "difficult personal decision." He believes in the republican 
party, he believes in this country and the causes he believes in, 
that this was a matter of duty and he should step aside and allow 
them to go forward as a united front and keep fighting for those goals. 
Gingrich also told his colleagues he will be quitting Congress altogether. 
He was obviously very distressed, but he got right to the point. He 
didn't mince any words. Possible successors had already started lining 
up earlier in the day. His longtime friend, appropriations committee 
chairman Bob Livingston, went first with his intent to challenge Gingrich. 
Then Chris Cox made announcement on "the Larry king show." I haven't 
a hat, but if I did I'd take it off and toss it in. Republicans were 
full of praise for Gingrich, citing his "Incredible courage." He didn't 
fail us at all. He served us as a giant. I think he will go down as 
one of the most historic speakers in this century, if maybe in the 
history of the country. President Clinton also issued a statement 
-- from the house democratic leader, a more partisan comment -- The 
next speaker will replace a man republicans say united the party and 
led it to an historic victory. Four years later, Gingrich was shouldering 
the blame for a disappointing election and a badly divided republican 
party. Bob Franken, CNN, Washington.
