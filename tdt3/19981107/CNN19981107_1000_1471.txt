Sad news for animal and art lovers. Ruby, the painting pachyderm, 
was euthanized during surgery yesterday at the Phoenix zoo. Vets operated 
on her after a failed pregnancy and discovered she was suffering from 
a fatal infection. Hundreds of zoo visitors held a candlelight vigil 
for ruby. The elephant's abstract art raised about $500,000 for the 
zoo.
