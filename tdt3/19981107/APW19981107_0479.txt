Switzerland is helping Ukrainian authorities in their attempts to 
track down money allegedly stashed away in Swiss banks by a former 
premier and current opposition leader, an official said Saturday. 
Folco Galli, spokesman for the Federal Police Office, said since February 
1997 it had received 20 separate requests from Ukraine for legal aid 
in the case of Pavlo Lazarenko, who is accused of corruption. Switzerland 
had handed over some bank documents to Ukraine, Galli said. But he 
could not confirm a report by the respected Neue Zuercher Zeitung 
newspaper that about dlrs 40 million in accounts had been frozen. 
Most of the investigations in Switzerland concerned gathering evidence 
and questioning witnesses, he said. Lazarenko was prime minister in 
1996-97, when he was sacked by President Leonid Kuchma. He now leads 
the centrist opposition Hromoda party and has accused Kuchma and his 
allies of trying to blacken his name by the corruption charges. Last 
month he alleged that authorities were plotting to kill him. Ukraine's 
Justice Minister Suzanna Stanik visited Switzerland last week for 
talks with her Swiss counterpart Arnold Koller and Federal Prosecutor 
Carla del Ponte on legal assistance to the Kiev government. The Neue 
Zuercher Zeitung report said that several cantons (states) had frozen 
accounts linked to Lazarenko. Under Switzerland's decentralized legal 
system, individual cantons are responsible for investigating charges 
of money laundering.
