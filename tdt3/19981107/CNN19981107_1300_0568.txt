Several thousand people turned out across Russia today to Mark the 
81st anniversary of the bolshevik revolution. Demonstrations were 
held in 200 Russian cities and in other former Soviet republics. The 
turnout was lighter than many had predicted. Many of the protesters 
were angry with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. They blame him for 
the country's economic collapse. Yeltsin defended his reforms in a 
television address.
