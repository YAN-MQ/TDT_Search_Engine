An Islamic terrorist suspect was reported to have spent some time 
in the Czech Republic recently, showing interest in Radio Free Europe 
stationed in Prague, a leading newspaper said Saturday. The report 
in Lidove Noviny came only one week after the U.S.-funded radio started 
its broadcasts to Iraq and Iran from Czech territory. Czech government 
officials were not reachable on Saturday. The report did not say from 
what country the alleged terrorist was. The daily, which has been 
mostly reliable in the past, said the information, which apparently 
leaked from the Czech government, was confirmed by the Interior Ministry 
and the Czech intelligence service, BIS. ``The fact that this information 
leaked is awful,'' Lidove Noviny quoted Jaroslav Basta, minister without 
portfolio, who is in charge of secret services in the Czech Republic, 
as saying. Basta said not all the government was informed about the 
alleged terrorist's presence in the country but refused to say who 
of the ministers had the information. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty 
began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in 1951, spreading uncensored 
news to Soviet-controlled countries behind the Iron Curtain during 
the Cold War between the West and the Communist East. It moved its 
headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the collapse of communism 
six years earlier. Last month, the Czech government allowed broadcasts 
into Iraq, and the Farsi-language service into Iran was approved in 
August. The government, however, expressed serious concerns about 
possible security risks. Last Tuesday, Iran recalled its ambassador 
from Prague to protest the broadcasts. The BIS is worried that the 
leak can threaten its anti-terrorist operation which is carried out 
along with partner services from abroad, Lidove Noviny said. Basta 
denied allegations the leak was aimed at providing arguments for those 
who were opposing the broadcasts to Iran and Iraq, the daily said.
