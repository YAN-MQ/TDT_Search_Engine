Briton Mike Garside piloted Magellan Alpha into port 1 1-2 hours ahead 
of American Brad van Liew and his purple sloop Balance Bar on Saturday, 
taking second place in Class II of the of the Around Alone sailing 
regatta's first leg. Garside completed the 12,714-kilometer (6,865-nautical-mile) 
first leg from the American port of Charleston, South Carolina, or 
Cape Town in 41 days, 11 hours, 1 minute, 21 seconds, arriving at 
5:16 a.m. (0316 GMT). ``I had a blizzard about three days ago. The 
whole boat was covered in snow, Garside said. Van Liew sailed into 
port at 6:43 a.m., finishing third in the 15-meter (50-foot) class. 
Both followed Jean-Pierre Mouligne by nearly a day after the Frenchman 
steered Cray Valley across the line on Friday. The 18-meter (60-foot) 
Class I boats started arriving last Saturday, with Mike Golding of 
Britain breaking the speed record for the first leg. Golding's time 
was 34 days, 18 hours, 54 minutes and 44 seconds. He finished about 
2 1-2 hours ahead of Frenchwoman Isabelle Autissier. The 47,152-kilometer 
(25,460-nautical-mile) Around Alone race is divided into four legs. 
The solo racers will stop in Auckland, New Zealand, and Punta del 
Este, Uruguay, before returning to Charleston next spring. The race 
began in 1982 and is held once every four years. It was formerly called 
the BOC Challenge. The next leg to Auckland will begin on Dec. 5.
