Fly-half Diego Dominguez accounted for 13 points and Italy scored 
a try early in each half Saturday to build a big lead and then hold 
off favored Argentina for a 23-19 victory in a rugby union test match. 
Alessandro Moscardi scored a try off a scrum just three minutes into 
the match and Carlo Checcinato added another five points two minutes 
after halftime with a short burst following a series of nice exchanges 
up the left flank as the hosts built a 17-3 advantage before a crowd 
of about 8,000 at Garilli Stadium. The Argentine-born Dominguez, who 
is Italy's all-time leading scorer, connected on the two-point conversions 
after each try and added penalty kicks in the 23rd minute of the game 
and in the 23rd and 38th minutes of the second half. Argentina fly-half 
Gonzalo Quesada scored off three penalties, but also missed two kicks 
in a row in the second half _ six lost points that could have given 
the South Americans a victory. The visitors rallied late in the game 
as substitute Juan Fernandez Miranda hit a penalty with 14 minutes 
remaining, and the referee awarded Argentina a technical try in the 
closing minutes when Dominguez was whistled for obstruction. Italy, 
which last defeated Argentina in 1995, has put together a string of 
impressive outings in the build-up to when it joins the prestigious 
Five Nations tournament in 2000. The Italians were opening their new 
season ahead of qualifying rounds for the 1999 World Cup and earned 
a victory bonus of 5 million lire (dlrs 3,000) per player Saturday. 
Massimo Cuttitta entered the game for Italy as a substitute at the 
half-hour mark of the second half and tied the country's record for 
most appearances with his 60th. ___ The lineups: Italy _ Paolo Vaccari,
