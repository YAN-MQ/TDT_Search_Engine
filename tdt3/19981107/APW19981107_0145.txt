Canadian Lorie Kane posted her career-best score of 8-under-par 64 
Saturday and surged ahead for a one-shot lead going into the final 
round of the dlrs 800,000 Japan Classic golf tournament. Kane, starting 
five strokes off the pace, sank nine birdies, including four straight 
from No. 13, against a lone bogey, en route to a 10-under 134 total 
over the twisty 6,338-yard (5,768-meter), par-72 Musashigaoka Golf 
Club course near Tokyo. She had a previous low career round of 65 
in the third round of the 1997 State Farm Rail Classic. ``I was pleased 
with the round today,'' said Kane, seeking her first LPGA title since 
turning professional in 1993. ``I was putting well and I was hitting 
the ball right.'' Taiwanese Huang Yu-chen shot a 68 and kept her position 
in second place with a 135 total for the tournament, the next-to-last 
official U.S. LPGA event of the year. Japanese star Hiromi Kobayashi, 
winner of the Rainbow Foods LPGA Classic in August, fired her second 
straight 68 and was alone in third at 136. Lisa Walters and Helen 
Alfredsson each shot a 67 and tied for fourth at 138. LPGA Hall of 
Famer Betsy King also turned in a 67 and shared sixth at 139 with 
Kris Tschetter, Megumi Matsuo and overnight leader Tina Barrett. Tschetter 
and Matsuo went around in 69, while Barrett struggled to a 74. Defending 
champion Liselotte Neumann of Sweden shot her second straight 72 for 
a share of 27th at 144. Akiko Fukushima, Japan's top money winner 
in the last two seasons, fired a fat 76 for 149. She has just qualified 
for the U.S. tour. The Japan Classic is a limited-field event featuring 
45 of the top players from the U.S. LPGA Tour and 38 members of the 
Japan LPGA Tour. Of the field of 83, Janice Moodie and eight players 
from the Japan tour failed to qualify for the final round. It took 
a 149 to survive the cut. Annika Sorenstam, who leads the race for 
U.S. LPGA's Player of the Year points and the season money list, has 
skipped the tournament. So did rookie sensation Pak Se-ri, who has 
already clinched the 1998 Rolex Rookie of the Year honors. She was 
forced to withdraw due to illness and fatigue.
