Just days after winning his first term in the house, Greg Walden of 
Oregon delivered the republican radio address. He shared some lessons 
from the campaign trail. He said Americans want a strong economy, 
tax cuts for the middle class and improvements in education. He also 
made an appeal to President Clinton. Mr. president, I ask you to join 
us in rededicating the next two years not to partisanship or posturing, 
but to real, honest-to-goodness problem solving where we debate policies, 
not personalities. Where we recognize our differences in philosophy, 
but work together for solutions. House majority leader Dick Armey 
picked Walden for the address to introduce a fresh new face to a national 
audience.
