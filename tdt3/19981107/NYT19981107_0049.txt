There are times when Dr. Warren Hern feels more like a combat veteran 
than a physician. Here is what he says about a normal workday: ``I 
walk out of my office and the first thing I do is look at the parking 
garage that the hospital built two doors away and see if there is 
a sniper on the roof. I basically expect to be shot any day.'' Two 
of his close friends have been shot. ``My dear friend, Garson Romalis 
in Vancouver _ he was the first of the Canadian doctors to be shot. 
They almost shot off his leg. He nearly died on his kitchen floor.'' 
That was in the fall of 1994. Dr. George Tiller was another friend. 
He was shot in both arms in Wichita, Kan., in 1993. Other doctors 
have fallen. Dr. David Gunn was shot to death in Pensacola, Fla., 
in 1993, and Dr. John Britton was shot to death, also in Pensacola, 
in 1994. Dr. Barnett Slepian was shot to death in the Buffalo suburb 
of Amherst a little over two weeks ago. There are big headlines whenever 
a doctor who performs abortions is killed, but the relentless terror 
and gruesome violence that continue to plague abortion providers and 
the people who assist them take place below the level of consciousness 
of most Americans. Few people know about Robert Sanderson, the Birmingham, 
Ala., police officer moonlighting as a security guard whose body literally 
was blown to pieces in the bombing of a clinic last January. Or about 
the widely circulated ``Army of God'' manual that gives detailed information 
on the construction and use of bombs and other murderous devices, 
and recommends that if you don't kill doctors who perform abortions 
you should at least render their hands useless. ``It's a war zone,'' 
said Hern, who runs the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Boulder, Colo. 
``It's very frightening and it ruins your life.'' The terror frightens 
everyone. Hern said: ``We had this absolutely fantastic candidate 
for a front-desk job in my office. She was ready to accept, but because 
of the assassination of Slepian she decided not to work here. She 
talked to her friends and family and decided she could not live with 
that kind of fear. I didn't blame her. That has happened on numerous 
occasions. We've had people leave here because of the violence.'' 
What that means, said Hern, is that the violence and the terror are 
working. ``How do we provide these services to women,'' he asked, 
``if those who would help us are terrified?'' The anti-abortion terrorists 
get much aid and comfort _ sometimes openly, sometimes covertly _ 
from various right-wing political elements, including members of the 
Christian right, the militia movement and the white supremacy movement. 
The moral fervor of the right, so loudly proclaimed, is selective 
indeed. The feeling of many on the right is that if violence and terror 
result in the curtailment of abortion, so be it. Hern is the author 
of ``Abortion Services,'' the principal textbook on abortion for doctors 
in the U.S. and a number of other countries. He is also an associate 
clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University 
of Colorado. He lost count of the death threats against him many years 
ago. They started as soon as he began doing abortions back in the 
early 1970s. ``I slept with a rifle beside my bed,'' he said, ``because 
I lived up in the mountains and was afraid I would be attacked.'' 
He wears a bulletproof vest at some of his public appearances. In 
1988 someone fired five shots into his office. ``I had to install 
bulletproof windows,'' he said. He'd already hired private, armed 
security guards. The harassment, the demonstrations and the terror 
continued. The office at times was surrounded by 50 to 100 peace officers 
of one kind or another. ``It was,'' said Hern, ``a nightmare.'' Now 
the hard right has been dealt a setback. The extremists have faltered, 
at least momentarily. Newt Gingrich is packing his bags and the Republican 
Party is searching frantically for a friendlier demeanor. This can 
only help. ``It seems that the radical right lost a lot of ground 
in the election and that's very encouraging,'' said Hern. ``There 
clearly are Republicans out there who don't agree with that agenda 
and they should be running the party. Then people can get a little 
balance back.''
