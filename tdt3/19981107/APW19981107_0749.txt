Bob Tway shot a flawless 6-under 66 Saturday and took a one-stroke 
lead over fellow American Dudley Hart after the third round of the 
Sarazen World Open. Hart fired a tournament-record 62, including a 
28 on the front nine. Tway, who began the round two shots behind second-round 
leader English-born American resident Edward Fryatt, was at 14-under 
202 going into Sunday's final round for the dlrs 320,000 top prize. 
Hart, seven shots back starting Saturday's round, was at 203. His 
62 matched the record set last year by defending champion Mark Calcavecchia 
in the dlrs 2 million tournament at the par-72, 6,993-yard Legends 
at Chateau Elan course. Fryatt slumped to an 11-over 83 after consecutive 
67s, and was far back at 217. Ricardo Gonzalez of Argentina was third 
at 207 after a 70. Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain was another stroke 
back after a 67, which included nine birdies. He was tied with Greg 
Turner of New Zealand (68). Two-time U.S. Masters winner Bernhard 
Langer of Germany and American Bob Friend were at 209. Each shot 69. 
Tway, who has seven U.S. PGA Tour victories but hasn't won since the 
1995 MCI Classic at Hilton Head, South Carolina, had six birdies without 
a bogey. He was eighth last week in the U.S. Tour Championship and 
was 24th on the American PGA Tour money list with dlrs 1,073,447 in 
one of his best years since 1986 when he won four times, including 
the U.S. PGA Championship. Fryatt, 10-under entering the day, fell 
apart early. The five-time winner on the Asian tour shot opened with 
a double-bogey at No. 1, bogeyed the second, had another double-bogey 
at No. 5 and closed out his front nine with a triple-bogey for a 44. 
Hart, whose only victory was the 1996 Canadian Open, had a round that 
included nine birdies, an eagle, seven pars and a bogey at No. 18. 
He opened with birdies at the first two holes. He then parred the 
next two holes before going on a binge that began with an eagle at 
the par-5, fifth and was followed by six consecutive birdies. He added 
his final birdie at No. 16. Calcavecchia shot a 70 and was 14 back 
at 216 in the tournament that brings together the past two champions 
from open tourneys around the world, as well as several Sarazen selections. 
Two-time winner Frank Nobilo of New Zealand (1995-96) had a 78 and 
was at 226. Divots Sweden's Sven Struver had an ace at the par 3, 
185-yard (167-meter) third hole and a 71, but it still left him out 
of contention at 219.
