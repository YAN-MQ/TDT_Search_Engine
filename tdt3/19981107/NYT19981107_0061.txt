Jim Fassel knows what they are saying about him as his unraveling 
Giants lurch into the second half of their season. ``Sometimes I have 
to laugh,'' he said, standing beneath the Giants Stadium grandstand 
after Friday's practice. ``Last year, I'm the coach of the year. Half 
a season later, people are wondering if I have any clue what I'm doing. 
How did I get that dumb that fast?'' There are other things they are 
saying about Fassel. Why is his offense so conservative? Why can't 
he fix this mess of a Giants season? Has he, in his second year as 
the coach, lost control of his team? Or lost the magic that put a 
glow on last season? Is Fassel, like his Giants, having an off year? 
Fassel has heard those questions, too. He nods calmly when they are 
recited to him. And he has answers. ``I'm in control, I'm not a raving 
idiot, not out of sorts like I saw Ray Handley towards the end of 
his time here,'' Fassel said. ``I'm not any different this year, although 
my wife says I'm more intense than I was last year. It's natural when 
you lose, all kinds of things start to surface and people are going 
to analyze everything you do. ``It makes me more determined. I stand 
tall. I know what I want to do. I know where I want to go and nobody's 
going to change my course.'' It was a vexing week for Fassel, the 
first in his Giants' tenure in which adversity was so evident, with 
an ill mood enveloping everyone on the Giants as they prepared to 
take their 3-5 record to Dallas for Sunday's game with the Cowboys. 
Last Wednesday, Fassel responded disdainfully when a reporter questioned 
why he doesn't ``just open the offense up?'' ``Everybody thinks you 
just go back and throw the ball up in the air and guys make catches 
and all that stuff,'' Fassel answered. ``That's not the way it works. 
You've got to start by executing basic plays and build on that. End 
of conversation.'' On Thursday, he berated his players for their poor 
practice habits. ``We've got to be ready to fight,'' he said. And 
from the look on his face, he might have been ready to demonstrate 
what he meant. On Friday, Fassel, who is normally effusive around 
his players, spent some parts of practice aloof from them, quietly 
walking with his head down and his hands deep in his pockets. But 
afterward, Fassel insisted his grip on the Giants was no less firm 
and his personal vision for the team no less clear than it was a year 
ago. If he is suffering through a sophomore jinx as coach, he does 
not feel it. Fassel did acknowledge that despite his reputation as 
an offensive football guru, he has failed so far to repair the Giants' 
broken offense. ``I am embarrassed that we haven't been able to unlock 
that thing,'' he said of the offense, which is ranked 28th in the 
30-team National Football League. ``I feel bad about that.'' But in 
answer to a familiar question _ Why don't the Giants throw the football 
deep more often? _ Fassel was not as contrite. ``In the games, you 
see how many downfield passes are thrown,'' he said. ``Not how many 
are called.'' That answer is a variation on Fassel's reproach of quarterback 
Danny Kanell after the team's loss to Washington. He said then that 
Kanell was rushing his decision-making and ignoring open receivers 
down field. To Fassel, the Giants' season has been a misadventure 
with one reoccurring subplot _ his team is the youngest in the league. 
That was also true a year ago when the Giants were 10-5-1, but the 
1997 team seemed to listen better to their new coach, whom they regarded 
as a savior. That team, in retrospect, played well above its talent 
level. This season's team is playing as one would expect a young team 
to _ erratically because of inconsistent mental preparedness. One 
recent criticism of Fassel has been that he neglected to recognize 
that his players may have been taking their division-winning season 
of a year ago for granted, leading to an impassive approach to 1998. 
``Hindsight is 20-20,'' he said. ``I had no reason to believe we weren't 
mentally tough. Besides, in training camp, I'm trying to get leaders 
to stand up and assert themselves because we need them. If I ride 
them too hard, if I'm dominating everything again, I might step on 
those potential leaders. ``If I assumed they were going to be soft, 
that might not have worked either. We might be 1-7 now instead of 
3-5.'' Fassel has hardly given up trying to fix this season. A loss 
Sunday would all but mathematically eliminate the Giants from playoff 
contention. ``When I wake up in the morning, I don't think about what 
I'm going to wear or what I'm having for breakfast,'' he said. ``I 
think about what I could be doing to get this turned around. It's 
the last thing I think about before I go to bed.''
