Most new therapies for arthritis this year have produced mixed results. 
But doctors say a new super aspirin could be the best pain reliever 
yet. Rhonda Rowland reports. Anyone who suffers from chronic pain 
can probably relate to gloria baswell. To relieve her rheumatoid arthritis, 
she tried aspirin and many similar pain relievers known as nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs. They work, but -- I took them for at least 
nine years, and they really did a job on my stomach. To this day, 
I can't even take an aspirin. Now there's a new class of experimental 
medicines which may treat the pain without hurting the stomach. Okay. 
Have you experienced any adverse changes in the last eight weeks? 
Some already are calling them "super aspirin." To call them a super 
aspirin is probably not correct, in the sense, they're not stronger 
than the aspirins we have. They're equally good at pain relief. But 
what they are certainly super about is they're super safe. The new 
medicines are known as "Cox-2 inhibitors." They work like this -- 
an enzyme known as Cox-1 protects the stomach. Another enzyme, Cox-2, 
triggers pain and inflammation when you're hurt. Aspirin-like drugs 
block both Cox-1 and Cox-2, reducing pain, but also leading to side 
effects like ulcers. The new drugs block only Cox-2, providing pain 
relief without stomach trouble. Still, not all doctors are convinced 
the new Cox-2 inhibitors are better than the old aspirin-like drugs. 
It's a little bit premature to be declaring victory until we've had 
a large enough number of clinical trials and enough people treated 
for long periods of time to understand the risk to benefit ratio better. 
The first in the new class of drugs could be approved for use within 
months. Does it hurt? no. Other Cox-2 inhibitors are in final testing. 
One test subject likes the relief he gets. Two of the most painful 
things I experience is when I get into my car. Lifting my left leg 
up into the car, and it seems to be less painful. And using stairs 
is less painful. And at age 82, erwin shayne says he's thankful to 
move as much as he can. Rhonda Rowland, CNN.
