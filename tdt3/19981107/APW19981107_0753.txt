Sixteen seamen were missing on Saturday after their trawler capsized 
off the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa, an Air Force spokeswoman 
said. One survivor of Greek nationality was found on the beach and 
is being treated for mild injuries, Lt. Col. Laverne Machine said. 
The trawler, Daniela, registered to a Greek company in Durban, was 
travelling from Maputo, Mozambique to Durban when the accident happened 
on Friday. Search efforts on Saturday were called off as visibility 
faded, but would start again on Sunday, Machine said.
