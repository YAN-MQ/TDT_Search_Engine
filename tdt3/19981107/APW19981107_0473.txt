A new committee designed to give the public a greater say in decision-making 
in Gulf countries held its inaugural meeting on Saturday. The 30-member 
advisory panel was created almost a year ago at the December summit 
of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council in Kuwait. Kuwait is the 
only GCC state with an elected parliament but, as in the other member 
states, power is ultimately held by the ruling family. The other GCC 
members are Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi 
Arabia. Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, proposed the 
committee as a forum that would give opinions on issues referred by 
member governments. On Saturday, committee members elected Abdullah 
Bishara, a Kuwaiti and former secretary general of the GCC, as their 
chairman. In his acceptance speech, Bishara described the panel as 
expressing a ``renewal in thought and ... flexibility in the regimes,'' 
the Kuwait News Agency reported. A committee member from Qatar, Hamad 
bin Abdul-Aziz al-Kawwari, wrote in Saturday's edition of the independent 
Kuwaiti newspaper, Al-Qabas, that the forum's success would depend 
on what issues it reviews, its candor in dealing with them, and whether 
its recommendations are taken into consideration. Academics and opinion-makers 
have criticized the 17-year-old GCC, a loose political and economic 
alliance, for failing to improve the lives of its ordinary citizens. 
The committee consists of five men appointed as representatives of 
each member state. The Kuwaiti agency said 10 members are former or 
serving Cabinet ministers and four are former editors of newspapers 
or magazines.
