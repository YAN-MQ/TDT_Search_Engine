After nine days in orbit, John Glenn and the rest of the crew of the 
space shuttle "discovery" are back home. The shuttle landed smoothly 
today at the Kennedy space center in Florida. Much to NASA's relief, 
the shuttle's drag chute did not pop out of its compartment, which 
was damaged during liftoff. Glenn's wife and other family members 
joined hundreds of people at the landing strip. Commander Curtis brown 
thanked all those who helped make the mission possible. We had a very 
successful flight. We wanted to thank ksc for giving us a vehicle, 
"discovery," that had absolutely no problems, and we're very thrilled 
to bring it back to Kennedy today in the same condition that we left 
in. And I also would like to thank the Johnson space center and all 
the folks there who trained us, and all the payload folks who got 
it all organized, and mission control, who spent the long hours supporting 
the mission. 'cause as you know, we can't do this without a team. 
Glenn was the subject of ten experiments that studied space and age-related 
problems. The Ohio senator is the oldest person to ever go into orbit.
