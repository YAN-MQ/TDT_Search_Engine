Faced with their worst defeat in postwar German elections, the conservative 
Christian Democrats chose a new leader Saturday to guide them into 
a future without Helmut Kohl. Kohl gave up his grip on the party chairman's 
job in a tearful farewell, the last act of an era that ended when 
voters dumped him as chancellor on Sept. 27 after 16 years in power. 
Party delegates elected his hand-picked successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble, 
to the chairman's post that Kohl held for a quarter-century. Earlier, 
tears glistened on Kohl's jowls as a close aide, former Labor Minister 
Norbert Bluem, praised his greatest success _ German unification in 
1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Schaeuble, 56, faces the tough 
task of modernizing the party's image, something Kohl hindered. In 
his convention speech, he promised to marshal a strong opposition 
to the new center-left government of Social Democrats and environmentalist 
Greens, which won on a pledge to fight unemployment. He attacked election 
victor Gerhard Schroeder as ``the chancellor of randomness'' for leading 
Germany to the left despite a centrist platform, and he vowed to oppose 
government plans to ease citizenship rules to help integrate foreigners. 
But he also chipped away at the 68-year-old Kohl's legacy, making 
clear that the Christian Democrats had lost touch with voters during 
his overbearing reign. ``We must open up for new issues and thinking,'' 
he declared. ``The CDU must regain its ability to campaign.'' That 
could include reaching out to labor unions and ecology-minded voters, 
he said. A key task, he said, was regaining voters in economically 
struggling eastern Germany, the formerly communist area where the 
Christian Democrats were routed despite Kohl's image as ``father of 
German unity.'' Considered a pro-market reformer, Schaeuble was Germany's 
most popular politician in pre-election polls. A loyal Kohl protege 
who suppressed his own yearning for the chancellorship, he has been 
in a wheelchair since an apparently deranged man shot him during campaigning 
in 1990. Running unopposed, Schaeuble polled a strong 93 percent support 
among the nearly 1,000 delegates. He will also keep his job as the 
party's leader in parliament. The rejuvenated leadership includes 
Christian Wulff, part of a loose group of up-and-coming Kohl critics 
mostly in their 40s who are known as ``Wild Youth.'' Wulff, who recently 
charged that the party has ``wasted away,'' won a vice chairman's 
post. The party's new general secretary, Angela Merkel, is an eastern 
German. With the focus on installing fresh faces, the Christian Democrats 
barely began the debate on their future after their worst showing 
in national elections since 1949. Schaeuble said the party must defend 
its core values _ free enterprise, European unity, law and order, 
and a commitment to social justice rooted in Christianity. Kohl urged 
the party to unite in the fight to regain power. ``Let us not give 
in to pressure to run after changing trends of political fashion,'' 
he said. He smiled and waved from the podium as delegates gave him 
a final, five-minute standing ovation before electing him honorary 
chairman.
