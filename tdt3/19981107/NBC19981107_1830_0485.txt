The three terms of speaker Gingrich have seen soaring highs and plunging 
lows. NBC's Rick Davis takes us back to the days when congressman 
Gingrich was a Virtual unknown. In 1984, most Americans had never 
heard of Newt Gingrich. Then he charged democrats can do nothing right 
and named names. That Enraged speaker of the house tip O'Neil. You 
deliberately stood in that well before and empty house and challenged 
these people and challenged their americanism. And that's the lowest 
thing I've seen in my 32 years in the house. The house ruled that 
O'Neil was out of order. Newt Gingrich was no longer an unknown. By 
1989, minority whip Gingrich orchestrated the resignation of house 
speaker Jim Wright after an ethics probe. In the 1994 elections, Gingrich 
outlined the contract with America, less government welfare reform 
tax cuts. Republicans won big. Gingrich was elected speaker of the 
house. i do. In November, 1995, a budget dispute between republicans 
and the president led to a government shutdown for four weeks. And 
then a gaffe. Gig grich complained about not getting a good seat on 
air force one going to it's Zach Rabin's funeral. Comments greeted 
by scorn, even in usually friendly newspapers. In 1996, Bill Clinton 
won reelection. And Gingrich was blamed when republicans lost nine 
seats in the house. And ethics charges mounted -- about money taken 
for a book deal. About tax exempt funds for college course he taught. 
And about campaign finances. To whatever degree I brought controversy 
or inappropriate attention to the house, I apologize. Gingrich was 
ordered to pay a $300,000 fine. Later, there was an unsuccessful attempt 
to unseat him as speaker. Then, the 1998 elections, republicans expected 
to win big, but lost five seats in the house. I take responsibility. 
I led the republican team in the house. And to many in party Gingrich 
was the focus of the blame. His era ended. Rick Davis, NBC news, New 
York.
