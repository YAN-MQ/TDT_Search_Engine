A prominent businessman with close ties to President Daniel arap Moi's 
ruling party was arrested by fraud investigators. Banking Fraud Investigations 
Department refused to specify the reason for the arrest of Kamlesh 
Pattni on Friday. Pattni is involved in two lawsuits. In a trial that 
resumed in March, Pattni is charged with fraudulently obtaining 5.8 
billion Kenya shillings (dlrs 83 million at 1992-93 rates) from the 
Central Bank of Kenya as compensation for gold, diamonds and other 
jewels allegedly exported from Kenya by his firm, Goldenberg International. 
Kenya has no gold or diamond reserves. Impatient with the government's 
failure to prosecute the case, which has been on the books since late 
1993, and its reluctance to tackle graft in the top echelons of the 
government, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank last 
year stopped multimillion dollar loans to Kenya. Pattni also is involved 
in a court dispute over the ownership of duty-free shops at Jomo Kenyatta 
International Airport, Nairobi, and Moi International Airport, Mombasa. 
Nassir Ibrahim Alif, chairman of World Duty Free, alleges Pattni forged 
letters, signatures and company seals to fraudulently sell the shops.
