Researchers are developing a plane which could cut airline travel 
time down from hours to minutes. Don Knapp examines the hypersoar. 
One day, travelers may step on a plane like this in San Francisco 
and step off in New York just a half hour later. It's hypersoar, a 
hypersonic airplane, designed to fly at ten times the speed of sound 
on a roller coaster path. It flies in an unusual way. What it does 
is it pops out of the atmosphere, then skips on the atmosphere, turning 
its engines on every time it hits the atmosphere, keeping this skipping 
motion going. You skip across the atmosphere until you get to the 
designation you want to go to. Hypersoar might also serve as a launch 
platform for satellites. Right now, it's little more than an idea 
that's been brewing in Preston carter's head for ten years. But Lawrence 
Livermore national laboratory thought enough of it to fund initial 
research. And private aerospace companies already work on special 
hybrid engines that combine air-breathing jets and rocket motors. 
Hypersoar passengers would zoom from a runway to the edge of space 
in ten minutes. Once you get out of the atmosphere, everyone, passengers, 
crew, become weightless, just like the astronauts in orbit, for two 
minutes. And then you start hitting the atmosphere and everyone on 
board is experiencing up to 1 1/2 Gs. Carter says his hypersoar would 
be twice as efficient as a Boeing 747 and a dozen times faster. If 
engineers are able to solve the technical problems of getting a plane 
to bounce around the atmosphere of the world, who'd want to fly like 
that, alternately pulling 1 1/2 Gs, then being weightless every couple 
of minutes? We found a few folks who said they would. I would think 
I would have some fears, but I still, you know, I'd give it a try. 
This can get you anywhere in the world in less than two hours. That 
would be fantastic. I hope you do it before I die. Carter is still 
looking for the $2.5 billion he needs to build a Prototype. If it 
comes through, the plane could be skipping over the atmosphere within 
five years. Don Knapp, CNN, Livermore, California.
