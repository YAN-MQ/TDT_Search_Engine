On Saturday morning the Mohammeds of the Nile Delta were a happy family 
of five. By evening they were a family of two. The three children 
_ brothers Sayed Mustapha, 10, Ibrahim, 9, and Ahmed, 7 _ had drowned 
while taking a dip in a canal. On hearing of the tragedy, their mother 
lost her powers of speech and their father fainted, police officials 
said in Faqus, a town 90 kilometers (55 miles) northeast of Cairo. 
It is not known why the boys drowned while having a swim on their 
way home from school. Swimming in the canals that irrigate the Delta 
is a common pastime. Their bodies have been recovered, said the officials, 
who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
