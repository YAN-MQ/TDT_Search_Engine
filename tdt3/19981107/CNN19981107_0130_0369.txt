A team of 400 legal scholars has issued a report that concludes president 
clinton has done nothing worthy of impeachment. The author of the 
report says dangerous precedents are being set by the current impeachment 
inquiry. She says if Congress removes the president because it doesn't 
like his behavior, the system of checks and balances will break down 
and the president will have no independence from Congress. Another 
expert says Congress must distinguish between what is inappropriate 
and what is impeachable. That's why the constitution authorizes impeachment 
only for high crimes and misdemeanors. In plain English, lying about 
a sexual affair, serious though that may be, even potentially a violation 
of criminal statutes -- lying about a sexual affair just isn't enough 
under our constitution to justify the impeachment of an elected president 
of the United States. Republicans plan to dispute that contention 
at a hearing Monday. 19 scholars will tell a house subcommittee what 
they believe the founders meant when they defined "impeachable offenses." 
A republican witness is expected to say lying under oath does qualify. 
The hearing was requested by democrats.
