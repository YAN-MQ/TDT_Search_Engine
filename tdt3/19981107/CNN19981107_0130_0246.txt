John Glenn and the rest of the astronauts aboard the shuttle "discovery" 
are scheduled to return to earth Saturday. But NASA is again concerned 
with a piece of landing equipment aimed at bringing Glenn home. "Discovery's" 
drag chute door accidentally came off during liftoff. Oddly enough, 
36 years ago during Glenn's Mercury flight, the heat shield came loose. 
Mission managers say the missing chute on "discovery" should not pose 
a Problem. A lot of analysis has been done over the week. Thermal 
analysis. Hot gas ingestion. Aeroanalysis. Vibration, acoustics, all 
that. We think, of course, that it saw its worst environment during 
ascent, and the most damage that would be done back there in the aft 
compartment, and probably has been done. If the chute is still in 
the compartment, we think that there probably had been some melting. 
We think the chute will remain where it is in the same situation that 
it has been all through reentry and post-wheel stop. So we really 
don't expect any change there at all. Landing crews were sent out 
at Edwards air force base in California because of gathering clouds 
forecast over Florida.
