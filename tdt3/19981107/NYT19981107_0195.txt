A fact of co-op life is that a board of directors is responsible for 
the sometimes complicated business of running the building. Co-op 
bylaws guarantee that the board must be elected by the shareholders 
_ but provide no guarantee that the election process will be easy. 
``Voting in co-ops can get pretty messy,'' said Donald Klein, a Manhattan 
lawyer who specializes in co-op and condominium law. One reason, Klein 
said, is that co-op voting rules are often based on more complex formulas 
than the ``one-person, one-vote'' rules covering government elections. 
Co-ops use three types of voting procedures, he said _ straight voting, 
cumulative voting and ``one shareholder, one vote'' _ which is the 
simplest but also the least common. Arthur Gussaroff, a Manhattan 
lawyer who specializes in government-subsidized co-ops, said that 
in buildings that use the latter procedure _ most of which are government-subsidized 
_ every unit is allocated one vote, regardless of the size or value 
of the unit. Accordingly, when the time comes to vote, each unit owner 
is entitled to vote one share for each open seat on the board. ``The 
idea was that every shareholder would be equal,'' Gussaroff said. 
``They didn't want to create a situation whereby if you have a larger 
apartment, you have more votes.'' As it turns out, however, most co-ops 
created under New York state's Business Corporation Law _ which accounts 
for most of the co-ops in New York today _ take a different approach. 
``The `one-shareholder, one-vote' formula ignores the fact that shareholders 
with larger apartments pay a larger share of the maintenance and should 
therefore have a greater influence in the building's affairs,'' said 
Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer. Accordingly, Cholst said, 
in most co-ops, the number of shares allocated to an apartment is 
based primarily on the size and value of the apartment in relation 
to others in the building. And most co-ops, Cholst said, use what 
is known as a straight voting system to elect directors. With such 
a system, he said, unit owners are given a specific number of votes 
equal to their number of shares. Those votes can then be cast for 
a specific candidate for each board opening. ``With a straight voting 
system, the number of votes an individual unit owner can award to 
a particular candidate is limited by the number of votes the unit 
owner has,'' Cholst said. And while such a voting process may seem 
democratic, Cholst said, it nevertheless allows for some seemingly 
undemocratic results. For example, he said, if there are a small number 
of unit owners who own very large apartments that have been allocated 
great numbers of shares, it is possible for that small minority to 
control the building if the number of shares they collectively own 
gives them a majority of votes. At the same time, Cholst said, with 
a straight voting system, it is possible for a small number of individuals 
_ such as investors or a sponsor _ who own a large number of units 
to exercise control by pooling their votes. And finally, Cholst said, 
with a straight voting system, if one group of shareholders manages 
to put together enough votes to constitute a majority, that group 
will be able to elect its candidates to every seat on the board, preventing 
the minority from having any influence. There is a way, however, for 
minority shareholders to get a foothold on the board and have some 
influence _ if a building allows what is known as cumulative voting. 
``Cumulative voting is essentially a very democratic process,'' said 
Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer and vice president of the Council 
of New York Cooperatives. ``It helps assure that a minority group 
of shareholders can get proportionate representation on the board.'' 
With cumulative voting, as with straight voting, each unit owner is 
allocated a number of votes equal to the number of his shares. Unlike 
straight voting, however, Weinstein said, the votes are then multiplied 
by the number of seats on the board that are up for election. For 
example, he said, in a building with straight voting and seven open 
board seats, a unit owner with 200 shares will have 200 votes to cast 
for a particular candidate for each of the seven open seats. With 
cumulative voting, however, that same unit owner would have a total 
of 1,400 votes to cast any way he or she wishes. ``You can spread 
them out among several candidates for several seats or you can cast 
all 1,400 votes for one candidate for one seat,'' Weinstein said. 
``And therein lie the strategies possible with cumulative voting.'' 
Generally, he said, if there are opposing groups of shareholders vying 
for power, it is possible with cumulative voting for a well-organized 
minority to take control of the board from a less-well-organized majority. 
``The basic strategy is to gain control of the board,'' Weinstein 
said. ``So in a contested election for, say, seven board seats, a 
well-organized minority group of shareholders can throw all their 
votes to just four candidates while the less-organized majority spreads 
its votes among seven candidates for seven seats.'' Of course, Weinstein 
said, if the majority is as well-organized as the minority, it is 
possible for the more powerful group to undermine the minority's attempt 
to gain control by using the same four-candidates-only strategy. However, 
he said, even in that situation, cumulative voting can give minority 
shareholders the ability to gain at least a foothold on the board. 
``The minority group can bullet-ballot every one of their votes for 
just one or two candidates,'' Weinstein said, adding that while such 
a strategy would not give the minority control, the election of one 
or two friendly directors would give it the ability to influence actions 
of other board members. And if the majority tried to duplicate the 
minority's strategy, by voting for only one or two candidates, it 
would risk losing control of the other open seats. Cumulative voting, 
however, has one problem that co-op lawyers must constantly confront. 
``It's so darn complicated,'' said Stuart Saft, a Manhattan lawyer 
and chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives. In fact, Saft 
said, all the benefits of cumulative voting could be lost if a shareholder 
makes an arithmetic error when allocating votes among several candidates. 
``If you mess up,'' he said, ``your ballot is void.''
