Even with advertising rates going up and ratings going down, network 
executives and sponsors see sports programming as a winning investment. 
Jill Brooke reports. It used to be so easy to catch a guy, put him 
in front of a Sports event and like clockwork, the ratings would soar, 
making the advertisers and big networks very happy. But the success 
of sports has created new competition and new problems. People considered 
sports impervious to the erosion that's taken place in the rest of 
television. That's not true. There's a glut of sports out there. And 
the genie is out of the bottle. You're not going to get less sports. 
But it's simply not going to do as well as it used to. Ratings are 
down for all types of sporting events. And this couldn't come at a 
worse time. Just for football, the networks collectively spent $18 
billion. To offset these costs, the networks wanted as much as a 20% 
increase from advertisers. We drove a tough D-Al, because you can't 
expect advertisers to pay for all those increases and they're not 
going to. If they hear the advertisers complaining, okay, they've 
got themselves to blame. They're losing money, they've got themselves 
to blame. Nobody's held a gun to any network head to buy these sports. 
But the networks say sports is still a good buy. That is the only 
safe bet in any of the media today that you can guarantee that a large 
group of men is going to be watching. Even if the networks don't get 
as much revenue from ads, they get other benefits from attracting 
so much testosterone. I smell something questionable. CBS says that 
"everybody loves Raymond," heavily promoted in the games, is now up 
25%. One rating point per prime time show can mean as much as $100 
million in revenue. Since we got the NFL back, something like 13 or 
14 shows on our schedule are up in male demographics, significantly. 
So having sports, having the NFL -- A, it's has helped our prime time 
schedule, B, it's helped our owned and operated station. So there 
are a lot of other factors than just what is the cost of the sport 
and what are we getting in advertising revenue. According to an advertising 
study from tn media, male viewership is still very strong. In 1985, 
men watched 160 hours of sports programming. That figure has now climbed 
to as much as 193 hours. The only difference now is that the sports 
franchise is more expensive. The big ratings are no longer a slam 
dunk. Jill Brooke, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
