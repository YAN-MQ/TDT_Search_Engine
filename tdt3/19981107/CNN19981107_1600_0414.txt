No background check, no gun, no exceptions. President Clinton says 
that's how the Brady law ought to work. He's ordering the treasury 
and justice departments to close a loophole that allows dealers at 
gun shows to sell firearms with no questions asked. In his weekly 
radio address, Mr. Clinton also highlighted some upcoming changes 
in the law. At the end of this month, we will make the Brady law even 
stronger. For the first time ever we'll require background checks 
for the purchase of any firearm, whether purchased from a license 
gun dealer or a pawn shop. But under this new instacheck system, as 
it's called, we'll be able to run nearly twice as many background 
checks, and most of them in just a matter of minutes. The White House 
estimates the new instacheck system could triple the number of background 
checks conducted each year.
