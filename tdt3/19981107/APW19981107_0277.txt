Defense Secretary George Robertson insisted Saturday that the use 
of force must remain an option in the effort to make Saddam Hussein 
back down in his latest confrontation with the United Nations over 
weapons monitoring. Robertson, who goes to Kuwait on Sunday to see 
British troops, told BBC Radio that the time for military action had 
not yet come. ``But it is still an option there because Saddam has 
reneged on the agreement he came to in February of this year'' with 
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Iraq announced Oct. 31 
it was halting all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which 
oversees the destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons 
as well as long-range missiles. The U.N. Security Council remains 
divided on whether to authorize military strikes as favored by the 
United States and Britain. ``Force is not the preferred option, it's 
not the best option but it has to be an option because in many ways 
that is the only thing Saddam recognizes,'' Robertson said. ``The 
world community,'' he said, was ``absolutely united in telling him 
he must comply with the Security Council resolutions and we are absolutely 
determined to get over the message in the Gulf and elsewhere that 
this man represents a threat not just to his neighbors but to the 
stability of the world as a whole.'' He said, however, that the overthrow 
of Saddam Hussein was not a matter for the international community, 
but for the people of Iraq who he believed would oust Saddam eventually. 
``We assist the democratic alternatives to Saddam but it is not the 
function of this country or the U.N. to set about removing people 
from power,'' he said. ``That is not the function of international 
law. There is no basis for doing that.'' Ahmed Chalabi, president 
of the opposition Iraqi National Congress, based in London, told the 
BBC that any campaign to bomb Iraq would be counterproductive because 
there was no serious attempt to overthrow Saddam. There ``had only 
been futile attempts'' to fuel a palace coup against Saddam, he said. 
He welcomed the Iraq Liberation Act, legislation introduced last month 
by U.S. Republicans in Congress to provide nearly dlrs 100 million 
in military aid to Iraqi opposition groups trying to oust Saddam. 
Chalabi called for the Iraqi resistance to be given weapons and training 
to overthrow Saddam.
