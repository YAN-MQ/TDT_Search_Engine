The executive committee of the Palestine liberation organization has 
agreed to change the portion of its charter that calls for the destruction 
of israel. It's a first step toward compliance with the mideast peace 
agreement worked out last month. On the security front, Palestinian 
authorities have arrested several members of the militant group Islamic 
Jihad, in connection with yesterday's car bombing in Jerusalem. The 
two suspected bombers were killed and 21 Israelis injured when the 
device went off, apparently prematurely, at a crowded market. Following 
the explosion, Palestinian authority leader Yasser Arafat went on 
israeli television. He promised to do everything possible to capture 
and punish those who were responsible.
