Two staunch conservatives have emerged in the race to replace Gingrich 
as house speaker. Congressman Bob Livingston, from Louisiana, was 
the first to announce his bid as a contender. He had hinted Gingrich 
should resign after the republicans' poor showing in tuesday's election. 
Lesser-known California congressman Christopher Cox also plans to 
be a Candidate. But he's considered a long shot right now. House ways 
and means committee chairman Bill Archer of Texas took himself out 
of the running today. He says he'd rather focus on lowering taxes 
and reducing government. Archer did have some advice for Gingrich's 
successor. Our nation, I believe, seeks leaders who will put principles 
before politics and ideas before ambition. I say that in reference 
to the president of the United States, the speaker of the house and 
the minority leader of the house. I ask President Clinton, congressman 
Gephardt, and whoever our next speaker will be to make those six words 
the light that guides them in all of their deliberations.
