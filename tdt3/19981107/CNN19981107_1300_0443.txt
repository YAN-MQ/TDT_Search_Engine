No background check, no gun, no exceptions. President Clinton says 
that's how the Brady law ought to work. He's ordering the treasury 
and justice departments to close a loophole that allows dealers at 
gun shows to sell firearms with no questions asked. In his weekly 
radio address, Mr. Clinton also highlighted some upcoming changes 
in the law. At the end of this month, we will make the wraed law even 
stronger. For the first time ever, we'll require background checks 
for the purchase of any firearm. Whether purchased from a licensed 
gun dealer or a pawn shop. Under this new system as it's called, we'll 
be able to run nearly twice as many background checks and most of 
them in just a matter of minutes. The White House estimates the new 
"instacheck" system could triple the number of background checks conducted 
each year.
