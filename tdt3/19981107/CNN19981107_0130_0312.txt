Palestinian authority President Yasser Arafat made a rare appearance 
on israeli television to condemn Friday's suicide bombing in Jerusalem. 
Police say a car bomb exploded in front of a crowded outdoor market. 
The two suspected bombers were killed. 21 shoppers were hurt, 1 seriously. 
The Israeli justice minister is blaming Islamic Jihad extremists for 
the attack. Arafat is promising to make a 100% effort to track down 
those responsible. Other Palestinian officials are urging Israel not 
to let the bombing derail the Middle East peace process. Israeli prime 
minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet were discussing the new 
land-for-peace plan at the time of the blast. They suspended debate, 
and have not scheduled a date for ratification talks to resume. President 
Clinton says this attempt to derail the peace process should come 
as no surprise. A similar bombing last year at the same market killed 
16 people and 2 suicide bombers.
