Internet users can make long-distance phone calls at local prices. 
But telephone companies want to change that, and it's up to the FCC 
to find a middle ground. Rick Lockridge reports in this edition of 
"tech trends." Paul elia builds web sites. He works out of the basement 
of his home. He says his business will not grow unless the Internet 
does, too. So if the Internet access becomes more expensive, Internet 
traffic will go down. And that will definitely affect us. Right now, 
most Internet calls are billed as local, even when they connect to 
faraway computers. Long distance carriers have been squabbling for 
years over who should pay for those connections. If the FCC decides 
to define Internet phone calls as "interstate" instead of "local," 
the long distance carriers could charge for them accordingly. That 
could mean higher Internet access rates for many of us. I believe 
there would be a great outcry from the public. Cary howell is CEO 
of an Internet service provider. What we would have to do at that 
time is reevaluate whether or not we just increase the base per-month 
charge or if we increase it to an hourly or per-minute connect rate. 
The new charges might not happen. The FCC has a history of protecting 
Internet users from higher telephone fees. But even if the agency 
rules otherwise this time, the threat of competition from cable modems 
and other technologies might persuade telephone companies to keep 
their prices down. Still, in the short term, by-the-minute phone fees 
could take a toll -- particularly on schools and small businesses 
like Paul elia's. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to absorb the increased 
cost. What we're going to do is get smarter about the time we spend 
online. Congress recently passed a moratorium on new Internet taxes, 
feeling that such taxes could have a chilling effect on the Internet. 
Now the FCC will have to decide whether by-the-minute phone charges 
could have a similarly harmful effect. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Atlanta.
