At the opposite end of the globe, a team of adventure lovers is crossing 
the Antarctic. We get details from rn-TV in the Netherlands. Vonard 
nar, expedition leader, 43 years of age. Officially a mountaineer. 
He climbed mount Everest and k2, and now wants to cross Antarctica. 
So we will start at the part of the Antarctic that is opposite of 
south africa and we'll end at the other side, which is opposite to 
New Zealand. The expedition of three will start its journey of 2,000 
nautical miles early November. Hopefully, 85 days to cross the Antarctic. 
2,000 nautical miles in 85 days for a large part on foot. But they 
also will use polar winds what is the worst case scenario that you 
have in your mind? Well, the worst case is that one of us will break 
a leg while we're sailing. We'll cross the Antarctic with the help 
of big parasails with four different kinds of them with us. For every 
wind speed we have different sail until, before 6 to 7 we can sail. 
Well, you can gain quite a lot of speed, at least 30 to 40 kilometers 
an hour. So that might be risky. The team may encounter temperatures 
of minus 55 degrees Celsius. The windchill factor will be even worse. 
Well it's extremely cold. And the windchill can be -- Oh even below 
minus 100. But, of course, then it is so cold you have to stay in 
your tent. So why does he want to do this? Because it never has been 
done before. This point one. Besides that, I love Antarctic. I've 
been there now three times and in, well, I'm not rich enough to travel 
to the Moon. And then Antarctica is the next option. Completely different 
environment. The temperature, the cold, the pure atmosphere. It is 
incredible. They'll have a tight schedule. The 27th of January, 1999, 
the Russian cruise ship will be waiting for them. There's a ship with 
tourist and it will stay there maybe for a few hours, maybe for one 
day but not longer. And if they miss it, they'll have a grave problem 
getting off. It costs a lot -- a hell of a lot of money. How much? 
About $250,000, $300,000 a night. Be that high, yeah. Val de von durhorst, 
television, CNN world report.
