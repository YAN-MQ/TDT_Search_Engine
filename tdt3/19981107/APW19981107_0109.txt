Singapore workers should brace themselves for a 15 percent pay reduction 
as part of business cost cutting measures to be unveiled by the government 
soon, reported state-run television Saturday. The overall 15 reduction 
would include a proposed 50 percent cut in employer's mandatory contributions 
to the workers' pension fund, said National Trades Union Congress 
chief Lim Boon Heng late Friday. Lim, who is also a cabinet minister, 
said Singaporeans must reduce their financial expectations because 
of the country's economic slowdown, which has already led to a record 
level of lay offs and falling salaries. Singapore is one of the most 
affluent places in Asia, and in recent years, its average annual per 
capita income has placed it among the ten most prosperous countries 
in the world. But the regional crisis has led to a real threat of 
recession here after years of strong growth, rising salaries and low 
unemployment. Singapore just posted its first quarterly economic contraction 
in 13 years. The city-state relies largely on foreign demand for its 
goods and services, and since operating expenses have risen to levels 
much higher than its competitors, Singapore has targeted business 
costs. A government panel is due to release recommendations on November 
11 that are widely expected to focus on slashing labor costs, principally 
through lower salaries and pension payments. But employers ``must 
not only look at wage cuts to bring companies to a competitive level,'' 
said Lim. ``They must also look at other costs that they can trim'' 
in addition to government action to lower fees, levies and other charges.
