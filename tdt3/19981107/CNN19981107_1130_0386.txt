The United States reportedly is considering extraditing former Chilean 
dictator augusto Pinochet to answer questions about a terrorist attack 
in washington, D.C. 22 years ago. According to "the Miami Herald," 
federal authorities are checking to see if pinochet played a role 
in the 1976 car bombing that killed an exiled chilean leader and an 
American. Federal authorities are also reportedly looking into possible 
links between pinochet and the 1973 deaths of two Americans in Chile. 
Pinochet is currently being held in Britain.
