Talks Saturday between the Iranian foreign minister and his Saudi 
counterpart focused on Iran's wish to improve relations with Egypt 
and the Iraqi-U.N. standoff, Saudi officials said. The Saudi foreign 
minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, who was scheduled to travel to Egypt 
Sunday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak, told reporters he hoped 
Iran and Egypt would upgrade their relations. The two states broke 
ties after Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. ``There are no obstacles 
to high-level relations between the two sides,'' the prince said. 
Officials said the object of Prince Saud's trip to Cairo was ``to 
mediate and improve relations between Iran and Egypt.'' Iranian Foreign 
Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who flew home late Saturday at the end of 
his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, held separate meetings with King 
Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah, handing over letters from President 
Mohammad Khatami, Saudi officials said. They did not reveal the contents 
of the messages. In his comments to reporters, Kharrazi did not mention 
Egypt. He spoke about the Iraqi showdown with the United Nations, 
saying that a political solution should be sought. The Iranian ambassador 
to Riyadh, Mohammed Nouri Shahroudi, said Iran and Saudi Arabia were 
opposed to a military strike against Iraq _ as the United States has 
threatened _ but also believed that Baghdad should abide by U.N. resolutions 
on its disarmament. ``The two sides are in complete agreement,'' Shahroudi 
told The Associated Press. On Oct. 31, Iraq halted all work by the 
U.N. inspectors responsible for overseeing the elimination of its 
weapons of mass destruction, a process Baghdad must complete to obtain 
the lifting of the sanctions imposed after its forces invaded Kuwait 
in 1990. Although officials did not say oil was on the agenda, Kharrazi 
is expected to have discussed with the Saudis how to deal with falling 
oil prices. Oil is the main source of income for Iran and Saudi Arabia, 
but the two states disagree on how to resolve the problem. Iran has 
supported additional production cuts to boost the world price, while 
Saudi Arabia has called for an extension of previous cuts until the 
end of 1999. Saudi Arabia used to be extremely wary of Iran, owing 
to Tehran's stated policy of exporting its Islamic revolution. The 
kingdom, a Sunni Muslim state, also disapproved of citizens from Iran, 
a Shiite Muslim state, holding demonstrations during the annual pilgrimage 
to Mecca. But relations began to improve after President Khatami, 
a political moderate, took office last year. The ties received a boost 
in February when Iran's former president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, visited 
the kingdom. In May, the two countries signed a wide-ranging agreement 
on trade, exchanges of academics and students, and technological cooperation.
