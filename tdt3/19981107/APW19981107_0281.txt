An Iraqi Kurdish leader said Saturday a proposed Kurdish federation 
in northern Iraq could be formed only through dialogue with a free 
Iraqi government. In September, a U.S.-backed deal that sealed a cease-fire 
between the two Iraqi Kurdish factions that control northern Iraq 
referred to a future federal authority for Kurds. ``That is the wish 
of our people,'' Masoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic 
Party, told a news conference in Ankara. ``The Kurdish regional parliament 
in 1992 declared this principal vital.'' However, he said, ``this 
can only be implemented with the central government in Baghdad when 
there is free Iraq.'' The reference to a federal structure for Kurds 
had angered Turkey. Turkey opposes creation of a Kurdish state in 
northern Iraq, fearing it inspire Turkey's own Kurdish rebels in their 
fight for autonomy. But Turkish leaders declared themselves reassured 
the plan would not lead to creation of a Kurdish state after meeting 
with Barzani on Wednesday. ``We do not call for the establishment 
of an independent Kurdish state, nor have Americans encouraged us 
to do so, at all,'' Barzani said. ``We know that this is not a realistic 
objective and we know the consequences of calling for an independent 
Kurdish state in this region.'' Repeatedly throughout Kurdish history, 
Kurds rebellions were crushed by forces of states in which they have 
lived. At present, they are divided by five national borders. ``Therefore, 
really, we look for what is possible for our people under these circumstances,'' 
Barzani said. He made no direct reference to Saddam Hussein. Saddam 
rejected Kurds' 1992 call for a federal authority, saying Kurds should 
be satisfied with the limited autonomy he offered them in 1978. Deputy 
Premier Bulent Ecevit said Wednesday that Barzani agreed that ``any 
solution to northern Iraq has to be within the territorial integrity 
of Iraq.'' Under the September accord, Barzani and Jalal Talabani 
of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan agreed to share power and hold 
elections in the de facto autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Iraq, 
set up after 1991 Gulf War. Barzani said the elections were scheduled 
for July. Talabani is also due to arrive in Ankara later in the day. 
He is expected to meet with Barzani on Sunday. Barzani said they would 
discuss details of carrying out the accord.
