This was by news for the president. The speaker's resignation clears 
the way for more cooperation with congress. Others think Gingrich 
will be missed because his low ratings in the public opinion polls 
made him an easy target. Brian, good evening. Some here at the White 
House say the speaker's resignation clears the way for more cooperation 
with Congress. Others think Gingrich will be missed because his low 
ratings in the public opinion polls made him an easy target. President 
Clinton, who didn't speak to reporters as he headed to camp David 
today, expressed surprise last night about the speaker's decision. 
In a written statement, he called Gingrich a worthy adversary and 
said -- despite profound differences, he appreciated those times they 
were able to work together. House democratic leader Richard Gephardt, 
who frequently clashed with gingrich on and off the floor of the House 
of Representatives, was less charitable saying -- aides say the president 
had an uneven relationship with Gingrich. They enjoyed their intellectual 
debates over how best to tackle domestic problems and admired each 
other's command of the issues. Having your leaders chat rather than 
fight is a good thing. But often that congeniality dissolved into 
bitter public disputes. Democrats say Capitol Hill without Gingrich 
will be less partisan. Gingrich was one of the most partisan people 
in the 20th century, and there was no real trust and no real way for 
people to reach out to one another. I hope that new republican leadership 
will help to forge a bipartisan coalition with democrats that want 
to work with republicans. White House aides say Gingrich's departure 
will have little effect on the upcoming impeachment hearings. They 
say this will not have much effect, they say this will reinforce that 
the hearings need to be over as soon as possible. NBC's John Palmer 
at the White House, thank you.
