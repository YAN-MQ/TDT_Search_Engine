"CNN Headline Sports" is next. And still to come, Henry winkler and 
Adam Sandler team up on the Hollywood gridiron. What do I want? I 
want to know I'm headed in the right direction. I want to keep my 
options open. I...I do want to take care of my family. I want to give 
something back. I want to learn, find what's right for me, be ready 
for anything... make the right choices. I want to find the people 
who can get me there. American express financial advisors can help 
you decide what you want to do and how to get there. I want to say 
I made a difference. I want to do more. If you could accompany your 
data on its trip overseas the experience would be alarming. Local 
carriers handing it to national carriers over to cable carriers... 
till you don't know who has your data. Unless you send it through 
here. With the one and only company that owns the entire network-- 
local, national, and international. So you know who has your data. 
On-net. From MCI Worldcom.
