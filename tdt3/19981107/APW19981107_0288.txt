Violence in Kosovo is growing despite an accord meant to end bloodshed 
in the turbulent Serbian province and set the stage for a political 
agreement between Serb authorities and Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians. 
Five suspected ethnic Albanian guerrillas died Friday in a shootout 
with Serb police, according to a Serb media statement. The deaths 
raised the number of ethnic Albanians killed since Thursday afternoon 
to seven. Foreign observers say attacks by both Serb forces and Kosovo 
guerrillas have increased this week, as the United States and European 
nations try to push ahead with the Oct. 12 agreement with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. Each side blames the other for the latest 
violence. Nevertheless, plans for setting up a 2,000-member Kosovo 
Verification Mission went ahead Saturday. An advance team for 74 American 
observers, who have been in Belgrade this past week, was coming to 
Kosovo, Richard Huckaby, the spokesman for the U.S. sector of the 
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, said Saturday. Milosevic stripped 
the majority Albanians of self-rule in 1989 in Kosovo, a province 
of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. That sparked protests and 
increased violence that led to his crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists 
in February. The rebels have rejected any political agreement that 
stops short of full independence for Kosovo, although they have grudgingly 
agreed to stop fighting if not attacked. Huckaby, the U.S. spokesman, 
said in Pristina that Saturday fewer than 10 of the 74 American observers 
would come to the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission headquarters 
in Kosovo's capital. The new observers are from DynCorp, a U.S. company 
of military specialists. The KDOM mission, which started in July, 
eventually will be absorbed into the larger Kosovo verification mission. 
KDOM chief Shaun Byrnes met with Adem Demaci, the political spokesman 
for the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, at Demaci's headquarters 
in Pristina on Saturday. No details were immediately available. Byrnes 
has said that KDOM officials meet regularly with the ethnic Albanian 
guerrillas to explain the accord in which Milosevic agreed to the 
withdrawal of Serbian police and Yugoslav army troops, to the return 
of all refugees and negotiations toward a political settlement of 
the Kosovo conflict.
