Hollywood is sprucing up some classics for release on home video and 
dvd. Dennis Michael shows us what's new this week. You should be kissed 
and often. And by someone who knows how. The newly restored version 
of "gone with the wind" arrives in home video this week with sound 
clarified, picture cleared up, in fact, everything is much clearer 
except what Scarlett saw in Ashley wilkes in the first place. "Gone 
with the wind" also makes its debut on dvd with this release, a Milestone 
for the format. You unlock this door with the key of imagination. 
Beyond it is another dimension. Submitted for your approval, the treasures 
of "the twilight zone." Some of television's strangest and smartest 
half hours have been placed on dvd exclusively. The navigation screen 
here is something Rod serling would surely have enjoyed. Here, bite 
on this bullet let me see what I can do. Oh, I can see mama comin'. 
Mama! Freed from the monkee cage, Mike Nesmith turned video mogul 
in the 70s, creating the first really significant made-for-video release 
"Elephant parts." The seams really show here as well as the enormous 
energy that was invested in this little project. Nesmith also turns 
out to be a considerably more talented musician than those monkee 
albums would have you think. See you at the rental counter. Dennis 
Michael, CNN, Los Angeles.
