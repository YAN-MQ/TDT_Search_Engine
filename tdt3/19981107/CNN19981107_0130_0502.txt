I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"Headline News" forecast. Our first major winter storm of the season 
pushes ashore Saturday morning on the west coast, bringing lots of 
rain and snow to the western section of the country. In between that 
frontal system and a second frontal system in the plains states, we're 
going to see lovely weather, with high pressure over the area, and 
high pressure in the east, but a good bit of snow from Missouri to 
the Great Lakes through Sunday morning. High temperatures on Saturday, 
very chilly over the northern Rockies and the northern plains, we're 
talking 20s and 30s, and cool across most of the nation. Your extended 
forecast showing cool temperatures prevailing over the northern third 
of the country, with rain and snow in the west, a snow/rain mix in 
the western Great Lakes and the northern plains, with thunderstorms 
on Sunday along the gulf coast. Most of the nation seeing wet weather 
on Monday, with heavy snow over the rockies in the forecast. And on 
Tuesday, the rain pushes to the east, it's going to be windy, and 
we're going to see snow in the northern plains. And remember, you
