Elton John gave a helping hand to U.N. efforts to fight hepatitis 
B with a fundraising concert in Geneva on Saturday. The World Health 
Organization is guaranteed a minimum 100,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 73,500) 
from the concert, with further proceeds from ticket sales and a charity 
auction. Hepatitis B, a virus that attacks the liver, is spread through 
exchange of bodily fluids. It can be transmitted through blood, sexual 
contact or infected needles. The Geneva-based WHO's vaccination campaign 
is subscribed to by 100 countries. But some 25 to 30 nations are missing 
out because they can't afford the vaccine, according to Bjorn Melgaard, 
director of WHO's expanded program on immunization. The donation from 
Elton John will be targeted at the countries which have been unable 
to join the WHO program, many of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The vaccine costs between 50 and 60 cents per dose in developing countries. 
WHO says it helped prevent 2.4 million children worldwide from contracting 
the disease last year. Some 350 million people carry the virus, it 
says. U.N. health chief Gro Harlem Brundtland thanked the pop star 
``on behalf of the WHO and the children who will benefit from this 
donation.'' WHO ``cannot do this alone,'' she added.
