Iran's foreign minister met Saturday with Crown Prince Abdullah during 
a visit to the kingdom to discuss Iraq's latest crisis with the United 
Nations and the low global oil prices. Kamal Kharrazi relayed a message 
to Abdullah from President Mohammad Khatami, the official Saudi Press 
Agency reported without giving details of the talks. The meeting was 
attended by Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, and Iranian 
ambassador, Mohammed Nouri Shahroudi. Kharrazi is due to meet King 
Fahd later, Shahroudi told The Associated Press. He said Iran and 
Saudi Arabia are against any strikes on Iraq, as advocated by the 
United States and Britain to retaliate for Baghdad's refusal to cooperate 
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
