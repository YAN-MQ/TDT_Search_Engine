Police found a dilapidated freighter bearing about 400 illegal immigrants 
drifting off southeastern Italy on Saturday, abandoned by its crew. 
Six children and two women from the boat were taken to a hospital 
for examination. The first police to board the ship described the 
overall condition of the refugees, most of them Kurds, as ``distressing,'' 
Italy's ANSA news service said. The ship had been painted black to 
avoid detection. Italian police found it about 400 meters (1,300 feet) 
off the very tip of the Italian peninsula, its engines cut. It was 
unclear how many days the refugees had been adrift. Authorities said 
the refugees may have been trying to signal other boats at the time 
they were found. The immigrants were taken from the boat to a holding 
center. Police were questioning them to find out the country from 
which the boat left. Authorities said favorable conditions at sea 
made for an overnight influx of illegal refugees along the coast of 
Italy's poor Puglia region, across the Adriatic from Albania and Yugoslavia. 
Hundreds are believed to have come to shore; 200 or more of them were 
stopped. Interior Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino had gone to Albania 
on Oct. 28 to promise more Italian assistance stopping the flow of 
refugees. She expressed frustration Saturday, saying, ``We had wished 
and hoped that the phenomenon would in some way be contained and stopped.''
