Less than two years after Bermuda's first woman premier took power, 
another woman is trying to lead an opposition party to its first victory 
when Bermudans go to the polls Monday. Both the ruling United Bermuda 
Party and the opposition Progressive Labour Party say their polls 
show them winning by a slim margin. But a victory by Progressive leader 
Jennifer Smith would widely be considered an upset. The United Bermuda 
Party has been in power since 1968, with Pamela Gordon as premier 
since then-Premier David Saul retired from politics 18 months ago. 
In play in Monday's elections are the 40 seats in the British-style 
Parliament. The parties are split along racial lines. Seventeen of 
the Progressive Party's 18 members in Parliament are black. Meanwhile, 
the United Bermuda Party is generally seen as a closer ally of the 
minority whites and the islands' business interests, even though Gordon 
herself and most of her Cabinet members are black. Bermuda, a cluster 
of islands in the Atlantic about 650 miles (1,000 kilometers) off 
the coast of North Carolina, traditionally has had one of the world's 
highest standards of living and low crime rates. But tourism has declined 
and the success of Bermuda's offshore banking and insurance businesses 
has eroded in recent years, prompting many of Bermuda's 58,000 residents 
to worry about the future.
