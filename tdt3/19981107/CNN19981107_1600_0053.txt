"It will be an interesting weekend." That's the reaction from one 
White House aide as news gets around house speaker Newt Gingrich is 
calling it quits. Another adviser says there are mixed feelings about 
it in the White House, as throughout the country. Outside his home 
in Georgia today, Gingrich said he's happy with his decision to leave 
Congress. Gingrich says he's looking into the legalities of resigning 
and the impact of a special election to replace him in his district. 
He says it's best for the republican party. I think as a practical 
matter for me to stay in the house would make it impossible for a 
new leader to have a chance to grow, to learn, and to do what they 
need to do. I think there comes a time when you have to step out and 
let the new team take over, let a new team try to do the best they 
can keeping the majority, winning the presidency in 2000, doing the 
right things for America will take every ounce of effort that the 
house republicans and the Senate republicans can put together. And 
I don't want to -- I don't think anybody should be a distraction.
