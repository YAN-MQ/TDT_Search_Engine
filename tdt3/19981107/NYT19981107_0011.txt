In other places, perhaps, Newt Gingrich stands for other things, for 
fervid conservative political ideals that seem to exclude some Americans. 
But here in Roswell, where the suburban sprawl has etched itself deep 
into the mountains, Gingrich stood mostly for independence. A lot 
of the people here in his suburban Atlanta congressional district 
felt that Gingrich believed, as they did, in a person's paying his 
own way. Gingrich believed ``in giving people the responsibility for 
living their own lives,'' said Ray Uecker, a landscape consultant 
who lives in Roswell. ``People here don't look to the government for 
their well-being. That's the way it should be. Gingrich believed that. 
It works. It really does work.'' Throughout Gingrich's district, people 
_ many of them the mostly white, middle-class families and retirees 
who made up his power base _ reacted with disbelief and disappointment 
when they heard that the speaker had said he was stepping down. Gingrich 
was more than a political leader here. He took their philosophy of 
self-reliance and shook it in the face of people who had different 
political ideals. ``I was disappointed, but I don't blame him,'' said 
Uecker, 57. ``He always had a bum rap from the press, from day one. 
He was always attacked by the liberal Democrats. But he was just a 
smart man with some good ideas, and they were afraid of him.'' Uecker 
added: ``He spoke frankly. He didn't pander to the public.'' They 
had hoped that some day he would be the president. Now that possibility 
is almost certainly lost. Gingrich became synonymous with the subdivisions 
of nearly identical but neat suburban houses where people for decades 
have turned to get away from what many of them considered the urban 
blight of Atlanta. People here cannot understand what is wrong with 
enjoying the life that they worked for, with having a nice house, 
a nice car and schools a cut above the inner city, things that they 
believed Gingrich had helped create and protect. ``I just like him,'' 
said Jon Shamroe, 39, a salesman, as he gassed up his white Mercedes. 
Shamroe, who said he always votes straight Republican, said the news 
came unexpectedly. He knew Gingrich was under fire but hoped he would 
weather this crisis as he had weathered others. ``Things have been 
real good in Roswell,'' Shamroe said. ``I have a nice house. I have 
a good job.'' Gingrich, he added, stood for that kind of life. Outside 
a Chinese restaurant here, a young couple with two small children 
were having an enjoyable night out until they heard about their favorite 
politician. Paul Bishop, a computer programmer, and his wife, Cheryl, 
reacted with the same word: ``No.'' They regard Gingrich not just 
as a powerful Washington politician, but as the man who always rode 
in Roswell's Youth Parade. ``We missed him this year,'' Mrs. Bishop 
said. It might have been a sign of worse things to come for his supporters. 
While Bishop was just as surprised as everyone else, he did think 
that some changes in the Republican Party might come after the poor 
showing in Tuesday's elections. He said he believed that the party 
had to come out more strongly for issues that it supports, and not 
just issues that it is against. ``I think the Republican Party is 
just trying to find out what it is for,'' he said. ``They're pro-life, 
pro-family, for fiscal responsibility. Those are the things that he 
stood for.'' But like a lot of people in this district, they believe 
that someone's head had to roll after the elections, and they were 
saddened that it was their candidate, their champion. People here 
were stunned that in a time when President Clinton seemed to be hanging 
by the thinnest of threads, it was Gingrich who had been dropped, 
even if by his own hand, from the national political scene. That sickened 
people like Uecker. ``The president is getting a high percentage of 
support at the same time people think he is a liar and cheat,'' he 
said. ``That's not right.'' Gingrich's announcement left 24-year-old 
Claudia Gurra feeling hopeless. ``I can't believe this,'' said Ms. 
Gurra, who works for Nationsbank and lives in Roswell. ``This gives 
me no hope at all.'' Former U.S. Sen. Mack Mattingly, who described 
himself as having known Gingrich for more than 20 years, said that 
he was surprised by the timing of the announcement but that Gingrich 
had said he was ``tired,'' and also said ``being attacked consistently 
wears you down.'' ``I really feel badly for him, but he made his choice,'' 
Mattingly said. ``He also said Congress won't change. Congress doesn't 
define strategy; the party does. All this changes is who is at the 
helm.''
