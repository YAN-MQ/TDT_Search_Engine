Republicans began lining up to challenge Gingrich even before he announced 
he would resign. Louisiana congressman Bob Livingston announced his 
candidacy for the speaker's job. He emphasized Gingrich's time as 
a republican leader had passed. Our ideas have gotten lost. Perhaps 
our message has gotten lost in the haze of high rhetoric and miscast 
priorities, lost in a management style where process is subordinated 
to polls and self-initiated crises.
