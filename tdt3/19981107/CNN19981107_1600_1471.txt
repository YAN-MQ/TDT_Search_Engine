A Canadian ice breaker has finished its year-long mission in the Arctic 
icecap. Its purpose was to measure changes in ice, sea life and the 
Arctic atmosphere. Researchers found ten times more sea life than 
anyone thought. And the Arctic ice actually got thinner during the 
project. It was the most ambitious research expedition ever in the 
Arctic. The collected data will be used to create accurate models 
of Arctic climate.
