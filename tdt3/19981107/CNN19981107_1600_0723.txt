Sad news for animal lovers. Ruby, the painting elephant, was euthanized 
during surgery yesterday at the phoenix zoo. Veterinarians operated 
on her after a failed pregnancy and discovered she was suffering from 
a fatal infection. Hundreds of zoo visitors held a candlelight vigil 
for ruby. The elephant's abstract art raised half a million dollars 
for the zoo.
