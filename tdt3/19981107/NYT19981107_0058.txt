Britain may have passed for the moment on joining Europe's new currency, 
the Euro, but this doesn't mean Brits are immune to the winds of change. 
Even the Royal Family will feel the bite of progress this month when 
the monarchy loses its centuries-old right to all whale carcasses 
found on England's beaches. This little known provision of English 
law _ which further stipulates that the head goes to the king and 
the tail to the queen _ is but one of hundreds of obscure laws that 
will become null and void when Parliament passes The Statute Law Repeals 
Act of 1998, as it is expected to do in the next few weeks. For the 
first time since the Victorian era, Londoners should soon be free 
to fly kites, beat a rug in public or roll a cask on the sidewalks 
without risk of arrest. Ships in British waters will no longer flout 
an 1824 anti-slave-trade law when they carry ``cooking vessels of 
an unusual size.'' Even legislators will benefit, by finally eradicating 
the 14th century act that forbids them from showing up at Westminster 
in full suits of armor. Shoveling away what some call ``statutory 
sludge'' falls to John Saunders, who heads the British Law Commission's 
Statute Revision Team and describes himself as a ``legal refuse collector.'' 
Since the British legal system lacks a self-cleaning mechanism that 
automatically sweeps dusty laws off the books, the Law Commission 
periodically presents Parliament with a compendium of out-of-date 
statutes destined for the rubbish bin. Some have been hoary relics 
(such as the ban on fish frying on boats docked in the River Thames); 
others were only recently enacted. To track down quarry, Saunders 
and his three colleagues hunt through history books, transcripts of 
Parliamentary debates and yellowing legal treatises that are often 
written in Latin or Norman French. ``People think that all we do is 
laugh ourselves silly all day over legal oddities.'' Saunders said 
recently during an interview in his tidy, London office. ``That is 
not so.'' Scuppering useless laws is not unlike transporting nitroglycerin. 
``Laws which have been lying like a sleeping dog sometimes wake up 
and bite,'' noted Saunders, citing a long-forgotten law that London 
squatters resurrected in the 1970s to block landlords from repossessing 
their buildings. The Revision Team, much as it might like to, cannot 
cut and slash with abandon. Its charter imposes a time-consuming burden 
of consensus gathering that forces the lawbusters to seek permission 
from a bewildering array of interested parties _ from Scottish dog 
wardens to multinational corporations. And sticklers sometimes protest 
when they think, mistakenly, that revocation erases actions born during 
the law's tenure. (A grandfather clause prevents that from happening.) 
Saunders lamented that not all government officials share his sense 
of urgency when it comes to reining in the bulging British statute 
book, which dates back to the 13th century. ``It is quite difficult 
to persuade government departments to find time'' to look at the team's 
correspondence, he said, ``so we try to help them as much as possible, 
which means writing up a full research note on the specific law. We 
don't want to give government departments an excuse to procrastinate.'' 
In any event, there is no shortage of outdated laws awaiting Saunders' 
chopping block. ``We could be here for another 10 years,'' he suggested, 
seeming to relish that prospect. Scrapping some laws, he acknowledged 
with a proud smile, gives him great pleasure: ``I particularly enjoyed 
rescinding The Enticement To Mutiny Act of 1797,'' he reminisced wistfully. 
``The government of the day was in a panic to stop an outbreak of 
mutinies. So they passed draconian laws intended to stop not only 
mutinies, but anyone trying to incite someone to mutiny. It was a 
knee-jerk reaction with heavy penalties. Very much enjoyed that one.'' 
Saunders bristled at the mention of sentimental antiquarians who would 
preserve all quaint statutes as if they were priceless artifacts. 
``A statute that stays on the books past its usefulness _ no matter 
how charming _ is really telling a lie,'' he said. ``We have a duty 
to maintain the statute book by a regular pruning in the same way 
that someone has a duty to maintain a garden in good working order.'' 
Of course, there are limits, he conceded. ``There might be the occasional 
Act so steeped in history that it would be churlish to repeal it,'' 
he said. Asked for an example, Saunders paused reflectively and answered 
with a chuckle, ``I suppose one might be slow to repeal the Magna 
Carta.''
