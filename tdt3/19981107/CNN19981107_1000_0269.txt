15 United Nations weapons inspectors have left Iraq. It's the first 
stage of a U.N. reduction of inspection teams in Iraq following Baghdad's 
decision to stop cooperating with them. Defense secretary William 
Cohen has wrapped up a tour of the mideast and europe. The trip was 
an attempt to gauge Arab and European reaction to the latest iraqi 
move. Based on our conversations, we believe we will have all the 
support necessary if we feel we have to take any military action. 
That's a decision that will have to be made by the president of course. 
But I'm satisfied after my conversations that we can carry out the 
military option that would have to be necessary. The United States 
has been threatening military strikes since Baghdad cut off ties with 
the inspectors a week ago.
