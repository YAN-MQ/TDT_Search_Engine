A major department store chain, Edgars, has agreed to boost minimum 
monthly wage to 1,500 rand (dlrs 270) for its employees after a six-week 
strike. The wage boost _ about 100 rand (dlrs 17) a month for all 
workers _ was negotiated through the official Commission for Conciliation, 
Arbitration and Mediation, a spokesman said Friday. The strike followed 
an announcement in late September that Edgars would have to freeze 
wages because of a 28 percent slump in profits. The two unions involved 
initially demanded wage increases of 15 to 20 percent, which the company 
said would force it to cut back jobs. The number of total employees 
was not known.
