Azumah Nelson, Africa's most celebrated boxer, is hanging up his gloves 
to devote time to business interests and help develop young fighters, 
Nelson's spokesman said Saturday. Nelson, 38, a three-time world champion 
featherweight and super-featherweight who is often praised as Africa's 
greatest boxer of all time, leaves with a record of 39 wins, five 
losses and two draws. He plans to pursue his multi-million dollar 
real estate interests and other business pursuits in his hometown 
of Accra, the fighter's spokesman Sam Okaitey said. Nelson also hopes 
to get involved in youth development programs in Ghana and elsewhere, 
Okaitey said. Nelson began his career in 1978 and turned pro shortly 
after the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, where he did not compete because 
of the American-led boycott. He has held various titles for more than 
10 years and had a draw and a victory in bouts against another triple 
world champion, Australia's Jeff Fenech. He has also won several African 
and Commonwealth titles.
