American National Basketball Association club owners and players appeared 
in no hurry to end the league's four-month lockout as the two sides 
made no effort to resume negotiations Saturday. The 130th day of the 
lockout passed without either side making contact about when to resume 
stalled negotiations. It could be at least another week until owners 
and players return to the bargaining table, raising the specter that 
the season might not begin until 1999. ``The way it was left yesterday, 
there probably won't be any contact for at least a few more days,'' 
union spokesperson Dan Wasserman said. The owners ended the most recent 
talks on Friday after 1 1-2 hours when the union was unwilling to 
back off its proposal of keeping 60 percent of the revenue. Players 
received 57 percent of revenue last season, prompting the league to 
reopen its labor contract. The owners, who wanted to pay no more than 
51.8 percent last season, want the percentage scaled back to 50 percent. 
Union director Billy Hunter was angered Friday by the owners' move 
to contact players about the league's latest proposal in an attempt 
Hunter described as trying to divide the union. Hunter claimed efforts 
were under way in Boston, Cleveland, Miami and Milwaukee to get players 
to support the NBA's latest plan. The union will spend the next few 
days contacting players to keep them abreast of developments. The 
negotiating committee will probably meet this week to discuss making 
a new proposal to the league. The start of the season has already 
been pushed back to mid-December at the earliest. In the first regular-season 
work stoppage in NBA history, 11 more games were lost Saturday, increasing 
the total to 45. The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. 
Under American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a collective 
bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out _ players 
from working until a deal is reached. The collective bargaining agreement 
(CBA) is the ground rules which sets things like minimum salaries, 
pension and health insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary 
cap. The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence 
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a ``hard'' 
salary cap. The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, 
but the so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard 
the cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary 
cap an invisible ceiling.
