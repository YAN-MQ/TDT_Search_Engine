There was not a slot machine to be seen inside the National Bowling 
Stadium, a cathedral of 78 lanes built three years ago in the midst 
of this gambling town's aging avenues of neon. Nor are any planned 
for the swath of construction that is expected nearby in a depressed 
neighborhood of empty buildings straddling the Truckee River. Faced 
with increasing competition from gambling on riverboats and Indian 
reservations, Reno is trying to diversify the economic engine that 
made the city's name recognized across the world. By giving visitors 
and local residents more reasons to go downtown than just to win a 
jackpot, officials here hope that the city's center, now a bit tarnished, 
will regain its luster. ``Gambling is all over the place now,'' said 
Jeff Griffin, mayor of Reno, an otherwise prosperous city of 170,000 
at the toe of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Until the '50s, it was 
the nation's pre-eminent gambling destination, but it now ranks fifth. 
``If people want to just pull slot-machine handles,'' the mayor observed, 
``they don't need to come all the way to Reno. We had to reinvent 
ourselves to broaden our appeal. We had to make attractions that even 
our harshest critics _ our own citizens _ would like. We saw that 
downtown was deteriorating, so we had to move aggressively.'' One 
of the few projects so far to come to fruition _ and certainly the 
most ambitious _ is the National Bowling Stadium. With 78 lanes in 
a vast hall that stretches longer than a football field, merely calling 
the $55- million facility a bowling alley would be misleading. It 
features a four-story atrium entrance, a pro shop with its own alley, 
giant scoreboards and permanent stadium seating for 750 spectators 
overlooking the lanes. It also has a large-screen theater. ``We've 
been called the Taj Mahal of bowling,'' said Jack Cook, vice president 
of stadium operations. ``Bowling needed something that was spectacular. 
What we have here is unique.'' Though impressive, the stadium is not 
the world's largest bowling facility. That distinction belongs to 
the one in the Showboat casino in Las Vegas, which has 106 lanes. 
The Reno-Sparks Convention &AMP; Visitors Authority, a local government 
agency, built the stadium primarily to play host to the world's two 
largest bowling tournaments. It was more of an economic decision, 
financed by a 1 percent hotel room tax, than one inspired by the love 
of sport. The American Bowling Congress and the Women's International 
Bowling Congress _ both amateur events _ last five months each and 
bring at least 90,000 competitors a year to Reno for two out of every 
three years. Participants fill up hotel rooms, see shows _ and gamble. 
``Bowlers are moderately good spenders,'' said Bill Eadington, director 
of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at 
the University of Nevada at Reno. ``They're not high rollers, but 
they are in town with all of the right motivations. They often bring 
family and friends here for five or six days and they come during 
a relatively slack period of the year from February to June.'' In 
the past, the tournaments had occasionally been held in Reno. But 
by building the stadium, city officials made sure that the events 
would continue to come to Reno on a rotating basis. Contracts with 
the two tournament associations prohibit use of the alleys by local 
leagues and visitors off the street. But management is permitted to 
book corporate parties, professional tournaments and smaller amateur 
events. During certain periods the stadium is virtually empty. At 
other times there can be hundreds of competitors from across the nation 
throwing strikes and picking up spares, as was the case recently during 
a money tournament organized by the Amateur Bowlers Tour. Among the 
bowlers was Marc Stern, a computer consultant from Langhorne, Pa., 
who was visiting Reno for the second time. While waiting to take to 
the lanes, he said that the stadium seemed so impressive during his 
first trip to the city two years before that the prospect of playing 
there again made him want to return. ``You can't even compare this 
place to where I bowl at home,'' Stern said. But the stadium's presence 
does not completely overshadow the obvious blight elsewhere in downtown. 
To get a sense of it, visitors need look no further than the famous 
arch across Virginia Street that declares that Reno is the ``Biggest 
Little City in the World.'' On one side of the sign's arc is the vacant 
Harold's Club casino. The stagnation is at its worst along the banks 
of the Truckee River, a five-minute walk south of the city's tourist 
strip of newer hotels and souvenir shops. Pedestrians who pass this 
way get an eyeful of empty office buildings and casinos. It is here 
where the city has pinned its downtown recovery. The Reno Redevelopment 
Agency bought several deteriorating blocks along the Truckee River 
for $11 million and is trying to market the neighborhood as a future 
riverfront promenade of shops and restaurants. People who want to 
gamble will have to go elsewhere in town. ``What's happening in gaming 
generally is the emphasis on visitors who gamble, not gamblers who 
visit,'' said Eadington, of the University of Nevada. ``So there is 
a turn to creating other entertainment possibilities.''
