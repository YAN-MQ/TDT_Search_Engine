Computer technology is constantly evolving. As Bruce Francis reports, 
that could have an impact on the price tag. Personal computer prices 
are continuing their power dive. A year ago, PCs costing under $1,000 
made up less than a quarter of the retail market. Now they account 
for just under a half all those sold in stores. The difference? The 
big high volume players are no longer just dabbling in bargain PCs. 
Now the sub-1,000 volume is really starting to be more of the big 
vendors. So we're seeing that IBM, H-P, obviously Compaq, are really 
starting to make it the main part of the retail game. Sargent says 
that PCs costing under $1,000 should make up the majority of those 
sold at retail by January. That's quite a shift for a trend dismissed 
as a fluke just two years ago. But some analysts think consumers could 
shift back towards the high end when Internet access speeds up, and 
applications like high-end video become practical for the home user. 
You'll see this trend towards lower prices may be slow somewhat, as 
the higher bandwidth opens up new possibilities and we experience 
what in effect will be the next killer application -- high bandwidth 
Internet access opening up a whole new world of possibilities for 
streaming media on the Internet. But so far, the Internet is generating 
demand for low-cost PCs, and Internet companies are propping up low 
margins by paying manufacturers to promote their services. Bruce Francis,
