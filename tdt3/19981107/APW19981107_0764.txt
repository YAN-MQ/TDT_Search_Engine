Defending champion Gil Morgan, who stayed in the shadows the first 
two rounds, surged to the front Saturday in the U.S. Senior Tour Championship. 
Morgan's 68 gave him a three-round total of 8-under 208, a shot better 
than Hale Irwin, Jim Albus and Ray Floyd. Jay Sigel, the 1996 champion, 
was another stroke behind after a 66. Despite 12 victories and more 
than dlrs 4 million in earnings in two full years on the American 
Senior Tour, Morgan has often been lost behind Irwin's charisma. It 
looked that way again this week when Irwin's opening 66 put him four 
strokes ahead of Morgan. Even when Floyd muscled past Irwin for the 
halfway lead, Morgan was three shots down and in danger of falling 
from contention. But after seven pars _ and several missed birdie 
chances _ Morgan got going with a birdie on No. 8. Consecutive birdies 
on the 14th and 15th holes put him in front for the first time in 
the tournament. ``It was kind of a little depressing early, but finally 
I got the ball up there,'' Morgan said. He'll go off Sunday with Floyd, 
the 1994 champion who shot a 72, and Albus, who lost a five-hole playoff 
to Floyd that year. He carded a 71 Saturday. Right ahead of them are 
Irwin, after a 70, and Sigel. All have played well at The Dunes. ``I 
don't think you can ever be very comfortable in this situation,'' 
Morgan said. ``You're going to have to play to up to snuff, or you're 
going to get beat is the bottom line.'' Early on, of the leaderboard 
changed often. Floyd took bogey on the first and third holes, tying 
him with Albus and Irwin. Albus threw a sand wedge 15 centimeters 
(6 inches) from the cup at No. 7 to take the lead. Floyd tied Albus 
with an eighth-hole birdie. Albus went ahead again after Floyd's bogey 
on No. 11, then retied it two holes later. Meanwhile, Irwin fought 
back from a double bogey 7 on No. _ the wedge master flopped on two 
consecutive shots inside 90 yards (81 meters) _ to take a shot off 
the lead with consecutive birdies on the ninth and 10th holes. By 
that time, Morgan had rolled in a 1-meter (3-foot) birdie on No. 12, 
an 5-meter (18-foot) putt at No. 14 and a 4 1-2-meter (15-foot) try 
at No. 15 to move in front. ``It's the top dogs this year that are 
right there,'' Albus said. ``This week is new to me. It's been a while 
since I've been in the hunt.'' Morgan said he could have lost his 
round with his inconsistent play the first seven holes. He reached 
the par-5, 505-yard (455-meter) fourth hole in two and was thinking 
eagle or birdie. Instead, he three-putted. Then he stubbed an 2 1-2-meter 
(8-foot) birdie try on No. 5. When he skyed a 4-wood 27 meters (30 
yards) over the par-5 eight hole, Morgan thought he was going to lose 
another opportunity, but got within a meter (3 feet) for a birdie. 
``I thought if I make another par I'm really dragging,'' he said. 
``But that turned me around a little bit.''
