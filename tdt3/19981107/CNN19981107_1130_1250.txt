Devon white got a three-year deal with the Dodgers. The seven-time 
gold Glover hit 279 with 22 homers and 85 RBIs this past season for 
Arizona. He also stole 22 bases. So now, Arizona needs a center fielder, 
and Bernie Williams is available. Cnnsi learned that the D-backs were 
discussing a seven-year offer in the neighborhood of $100 million 
for the long-time Yankee, but Arizona GM Joe garagiola Jr. denies 
that report.
