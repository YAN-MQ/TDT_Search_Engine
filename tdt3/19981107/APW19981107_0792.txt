Imagine Shirley Temple as Dorothy, Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Woodsman, 
W.C. Fields as the Wizard. Would ``The Wizard of Oz'' still have become 
an enduring classic? Nobody knows, because those early castings did 
not pan out. Somehow MGM came up with the perfect ingredients to create 
one of the most beloved movies of all time. Most people have enjoyed 
``The Wizard of Oz'' only on television. Now they will be able to 
view it as it was meant to be seen: on big screens in theaters _ well 
bigger screens, anyway. Warner Bros., which acquired the film with 
its purchase of Ted Turner's MGM library, is betting that millions 
will want to experience the film on the big screen. A restored, enhanced 
version is expected to reach 1,800 theaters in the United States this 
month. That's an amazing figure for a 59-year-old movie. Oddly enough, 
``The Wizard of Oz'' didn't seem to have much of a future when it 
was released in August 1939. It had cost dlrs 2.8 million _ a whopping 
amount in Depression years. According to Aljean Harmetz's well-researched 
book, ``The Making of 'The Wizard of Oz,''' MGM suffered a million-dollar 
loss in the movie's first release. It didn't show a profit until it 
began appearing on television, more than 15 years later. The history 
of ``The Wizard of Oz'' goes back to 1899, when an actor, playwright 
and former chicken farmer named L. (for Lyman) Frank Baum wrote a 
children's fantasy called ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'' It proved 
an immediate success, and he turned it into a Broadway musical. Film 
versions appeared in 1910 and 1925, and by the 1930s, the rights belonged 
to independent producer Samuel Goldwyn. He sold them to MGM for dlrs 
50,000, a reasonable amount for a literary property at the time (David 
O. Selznick paid the same amount to Margaret Mitchell for ``Gone With 
the Wind,'' which also was released in 1939). MGM executives, especially 
Nicholas Schenck, president of the parent company, wanted Twentieth 
Century Fox star Shirley Temple for the role of Dorothy, reasoning 
that a top name was needed for marquee value. The film's producer, 
Mervyn LeRoy, and his associate, Arthur Freed, preferred a 16-year-old 
contract player with a loud voice, Judy Garland. The arguments went 
on for weeks but proved to be moot because Fox studio production boss 
Darryl Zanuck refused to lend Shirley _ his studio's greatest asset. 
Judy got the part, but other talent problems followed. Broadway and 
radio star Ed Wynn was first choice for the charlatan Wizard. He declined. 
W.C. Fields was sought for the role. Even at dlrs 5,000 a day, he 
refused such a small part. Another MGM contract player, Frank Morgan, 
was chosen. Two gangly hoofers had been selected for Dorothy's companions: 
Ray Bolger as the Tin Woodsman and Buddy Ebsen as the Scarecrow. But 
Bolger had his heart set on playing the Scarecrow, and his insistence 
prompted the studio to switch roles. Makeup artists painted Ebsen's 
face white and sprinkled him with aluminum dust. ``I worked in the 
picture about 10 days before I got sick'' from aluminum poisoning, 
Ebsen recalled in a 1985 interview. ``I think in some of the long 
shots that's me, because they didn't reshoot those.'' So Jack Haley 
inherited the Tin Woodsman role, and aluminum paste was used to avoid 
poisoning. The trio was completed with Broadway comic Bert Lahr as 
the Cowardly Lion. There were complications behind the camera, as 
well. Four directors worked on ``The Wizard of Oz.'' Richard Thorpe 
was fired after two weeks. George Cukor filled in for three days, 
then Victor Fleming directed for four months. When Fleming was summoned 
to replace George Cukor on ``Gone With the Wind,'' King Vidor agreed 
to complete the final 10 days. Filming was tough on the actors, especially 
Lahr, Haley and Bolger, who were covered with heavy makeup. The Technicolor 
film _ using a new, more vivid process for the time _ required huge 
banks of arc lamps to illuminate the big sets, quickly turning them 
into ovens. Judy Garland, who was paid dlrs 100 a week when she started 
her contract with MGM at 12, had risen to dlrs 500 a week by the time 
``The Wizard of Oz'' started filming on Oct. 12, 1938. She had been 
a vaudevillian herself, but she hadn't learned ``upstaging'' as had 
her companions on the Yellow Brick Road. ``I was supposed to be up 
front with the three of them,'' Garland was quoted as saying by her 
fifth husband, Mickey Deans, in his book, ``Weep No More, My Lady, 
``but I always trailed after them because they managed to push me 
in the back. ``I was too scared to complain. But Victor Fleming, sitting 
on the boom, yelled, 'Hey, you three dirty hams, let's have the little 
girl in there.''' The Munchkins _ 124 little people, mostly recruited 
from the vaudeville act Singer's Midgets _ proved to be a headache. 
They were housed in the Culver City Hotel, which became the site of 
sex orgies and drunken brawls. Almost nightly the police had to be 
called. Their shenanigans were depicted in a 1981 flop movie, ``Under 
the Rainbow,'' starring Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher.
