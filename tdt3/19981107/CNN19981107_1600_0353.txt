West Bank intelligence officials say Palestinian authorities have 
arrested several members of the Islamic Jihad in connection with yesterday's 
car bombing in Jerusalem. The two suspected bombers were killed and 
21 Israelis injured when the device went off, apparently prematurely, 
outside a crowded market. Following the explosion, Palestinian authority 
leader Yasser Arafat went on israeli television. He promised to do 
everything possible to capture and punish those who are responsible.
