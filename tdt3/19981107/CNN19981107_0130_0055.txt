Fallout from Tuesday's midterm elections has reached all the way to 
the upper echelons of the republican party. In a stunning announcement 
Friday, congressman Newt Gingrich said he will not only step down 
as speaker, he will resign from the house before the 106th Congress 
convenes in January. In a statement released by his office, Gingrich 
said -- fellow republican colleagues were notified of the decision 
in a conference call. Gingrich's press secretary says he did it for 
the party. He decided, as a matter of principle, to keep the party 
together for the things that he believed it. Because he believes in 
the republican party, he believes in this country and the causes. 
He believes in that this was a matter of duty and he should step aside 
and allow them to go forward as a united front and keep fighting for 
those goals. He did say that there was a lack of focus, that we were 
not as focused with the vision as we needed to be, and he accepted 
responsibility for that. And I think that today he recognized that 
there was that feeling that was pretty much across the board and made 
the right decision to step aside, remove himself as a lightning Rod 
for dissention, and hopefully we will emerge with someone who can 
bring us together. It's very critical that we do that now rather than 
put it off.
