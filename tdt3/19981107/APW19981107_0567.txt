Authorities ousted Istanbul's pro-Islamic mayor as a result of his 
conviction for inciting religious hatred, Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia 
news agency said Saturday. The ouster was made official after an administrative 
court upheld Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 10-month prison sentence on Thursday. 
Erdogan, elected in 1994 as the first Islamic-oriented mayor of Turkey's 
largest city, was sentenced in September following his conviction 
for reading aloud a stridently Islamic poem at a rally. The conviction 
barred him from ever again serving in public office. It ended the 
political career of a man many saw as a future leader of Turkey's 
Islamic political movement. The Islamic movement has been hit repeatedly 
by Turkey's secular establishment, which closed down a forerunner 
of Erdogan's Virtue Party earlier this year. The leader of that party, 
former Premier Necmettin Erbakan, was banned from politics for five 
years. Istanbul's city board is to elect a new mayor from among its 
members in the next 10 days. It's not clear when Erdogan would start 
serving his sentence. Turkish law would let him postpone it until 
after the holy month of Ramadan, which starts in mid-December.
