Napoleon met his Waterloo only once. But French rail travelers to 
London meet it every time they take the Eurostar train to Waterloo 
Station, the British terminus of the high-speed line under the English 
Channel. Florent Longuepee, a conservative French politician, said 
he had actually never made the journey himself. But he wrote to British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair last week asking him to call the station 
after anything but the Belgian village where the duke of Wellington 
defeated the French emperor in 1815. ``It is not a question of erasing 
this feat of arms, realized with the Prussians at the expense of the 
French, from the history of your country,'' wrote Longuepee, with 
just a twist of the knife (his name means ``long sword'' in French). 
``At a time when we are building Europe,'' he wrote, ``it seems appropriate 
that the British nation should agree to give this station a new name.'' 
If they didn't, he suggested, he would propose renaming the French 
terminus of the line, the Gare du Nord, and calling it the ``Gare 
de Fontenoy,'' after another Belgian village, where Louis XV's army 
beat the British in 1745 after chivalrously allowing them to fire 
the first shots. His threat was weakened, Ben Macintyre noted Friday 
on the front page of The Times of London, by the fact that few people 
in Britain have ever heard of Fontenoy, whereas every French schoolchild 
knows what Waterloo signified. That was precisely the point of Longuepee's 
letter, Macintyre said. ``The Channel Tunnel is a strong symbol, too, 
and I think that a big effort should be made to make it a positive 
contribution to the construction of Europe,'' he said. Waterloo Station 
predated the Channel Tunnel by more than a century, taking its name 
from Waterloo Bridge over the Thames when the South Western Railway 
extended the tracks to that point on the river in 1848. A new terminal 
on its north side, widely acclaimed on both sides of the Channel for 
its stunning steel-and-glass design, opened when the Channel Tunnel 
did in 1994. ``I haven't been to London in years, and the last time 
I went was before the tunnel was finished,'' said Longuepee, a member 
of the Ile-de-France Regional Council for greater Paris. ``It's the 
principle of the thing that I'm concerned about.'' The French could 
have renamed the Gare de l'Est, where trains from Germany terminate 
in Paris, the Gare de Verdun, after the French World War I victory, 
he observed, but they didn't. The Times of London, in an editorial 
on the subject, said, ``If the French really want to rename the Gare 
du Nord, they should choose a more celebrated Norman victory, say, 
Hastings.'' ``The French Metro stations,'' the editorial also pointed 
out, ``are a roll of battle honor for the French and disgrace for 
the losers: Sebastopol, Solferino, Stalingrad, Austerlitz. ...'' Blair 
has not responded to Longuepee's letter. But, as the prime minister 
chose the Waterloo terminal to announce his plans for Britain's six-month 
presidency of the European Union in the spring of 1997, it seemed 
unlikely that he would agree to a new name for the station.
