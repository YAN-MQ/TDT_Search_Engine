It was a wild week at the office for House Republicans, who, being 
Republicans, talked a lot after a bruising midterm election about 
re-evaluating their company's sudden loss of market share, ``looking 
at everyone from the CEO to the janitor,'' as Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., 
put it. But upon abruptly losing their boss, Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
on Friday, the same Republicans who had spent much of the year fighting 
_ scheduling votes and then postponing them, failing even to pass 
a budget _ seemed united, if for only a moment, in their relief. The 
worst seemed behind them now. And in a moment, said Rep. Marge Roukema, 
R-N.J., a moderate, the focus shifted to the immediate future and 
the enormous challenge of governing with a six-vote majority: ``Now,'' 
Mrs. Roukema said, ``we've got to roll up our sleeves and go to work.'' 
Republicans already seemed to have a few ideas about how to do that, 
saying they should focus on tax cuts and work through disagreements 
rather than run from them. ``Any family therapist will tell you the 
worst thing you can do is sweep your problems under the rug,'' said 
Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., one of the conservatives in the Class of 
'94 who have grown increasingly unhappy with Gingrich and who had 
been first to say that he planned to block Gingrich's re-election 
as speaker. The fight averted _ the battle Gingrich had been expected 
to wage to hold on to power _ may yet give way to the fight to succeed 
him. But for now, some of the candidates for leadership roles were 
trying to out-nice one another on CNN's Larry King Live, offering 
lavish tributes to Gingrich and to each another. There was still no 
agreement on where Republicans had gone wrong: Had their error been 
in betraying their core conservative beliefs or in being held hostage 
by them? But in the days since the election, there has been a surprising 
consensus among both conservative and more moderate House Republicans 
on both what agenda they should pursue and how they might push it 
more effectively in the next Congress. All manner of Republicans said 
that one of their most serious problems had been their leadership's 
apparent fear of a fight. ``There was no reason we put off looking 
at appropriations for seven or eight months, with one excuse after 
another, and then came up at the end of the session with this omnibus 
bill that had everything but the kitchen sink in it and busted the 
budget,'' Mrs. Roukema said. ``It was all because they didn't want 
to look as though they were giving in to the president, or forcing 
a shutdown, or showing divisions in the party. They didn't want to 
face any of it, but we should bring these things to the floor and 
that's it. We win or we don't.'' Mark Souder, R-Ind., who is more 
conservative, used almost identical language to describe his frustrations. 
``Sometimes you have to be willing to try something and lose,'' Souder 
said. ``But we're afraid the news media and the public will decide 
we're not effective.'' So instead of working through hard questions, 
he said, ``We hold, we hold, we hold.'' And at the end of the session, 
he said, with another potentially disastrous government shutdown looming, 
nothing is accomplished. Souder and others said that applying a few 
management principles from the business world would not hurt the party. 
Neither would a little discipline and organizational skill. ``Last 
year we came in and diddled around for two months,'' Souder said. 
``Why can't the budget committee be meeting in December? Ninety percent 
of this stuff can be done ahead of time, but we don't even get rolling 
until March.'' There is also a basic agreement, even among social 
conservatives, that economic issues have often been shortchanged, 
to the party's detriment. The next Congress, many said, should be 
tightly focused on tax cuts, education, health care and protecting 
Social Security. Those who oppose abortion rights said they should 
fight hard, vote to ban certain late-term abortions _ and when they 
are vetoed, put the onus on the president. And, they hope to learn 
to sell that agenda with better marketing and public relations, a 
softer approach and a nicer smile. ``We've got to get serious about 
outreach'' to minorities and others who have not traditionally been 
part of the Republican base, said Watts, who is black, adding: ``I've 
been beating my head against the wall on that for four years. We've 
got to get more market share. You can't just throw mud on the wall 
60 days before an election and pray some of it sticks. You have to 
have a plan that says, `Here's my view of the future, and it includes 
you.''' Anne Northup, R-Ky., said that without such a clear message, 
cleanly articulated, ``certain members that don't enjoy the popular 
support of the conference just take it upon themselves to articulate 
something'' that damages the image of the whole group. For example, 
she said, ``There are certain members that have homosexual issues 
very high on their agenda.'' Ms. Northup said that Republicans might 
agree that homosexuals should not be able to marry or adopt children, 
adding: ``But it's not at the top of our agenda. If that's what wakes 
you up in the morning, then people will think, well, maybe you are 
mean-spirited. And if you are mean-spirited about that, then maybe 
you're mean-spirited about our elderly or our handicapped.'' Ms. Northup 
advocates a brand of ``compassionate conservatism.'' But some of those 
who have been the public face of the party in the House, she said, 
``don't understand this in their core.'' ``People who represent districts 
where there is disregard for people who've struggled or who come at 
life from a different angle, leadership has had no concept,'' Ms. 
Northup said. ``They want somebody in some focus group to tell them 
better words to use, but they don't feel it in their hearts.'' She 
is also among those who find fault with both conservative purists 
and an older generation of Republican legislators she described as 
altogether too cozy with Democrats, with ``a holier-than-thou attitude 
towards the conservatives.'' And while a whole raft of issues, notably 
social issues, still divides the House Republicans, many feel the 
more serious problem is one of attitude. ``We've got a real comity 
crisis, and the public wants a more thoughtful process for resolving 
the issues with greater respect for various sides,'' said Rep. Jim 
Leach, R-Iowa, a moderate. There is the sense that as a group, House 
Republicans may never know what hit them on Nov. 3. Speaking of the 
Republicans' apparently misguided decision to sponsor campaign commercials 
reminding voters of the presidential sex scandal, Rep. John Linder, 
R-Ga., who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, 
said: ``It was Newt's consultant who said, `We've got to deal with 
this,' and I agreed with him. It brought together all we had argued 
against. Then we were accused of doing unfair things by bringing up 
Monica Lewinsky. I don't know. I do not know how Americans respond 
to this.'' With a deep sigh, Linder added, ``But then, we must just 
go on.'' There is also the sense that there is no more time to spend 
meditating on these mysteries a mere two years before the 2000 elections. 
``We've got a lot to do in two years,'' said Rep. Michael Forbes, 
R-N.Y., who has become increasingly moderate since his election in 
1994 and was the first to announce he would not support Gingrich for 
speaker two years ago. ``I think the fight's over, so it clears the 
path,'' Forbes said. ``Now we can do some of the things we've talked 
about.''
