Evgeniya Radanova of Bulgaria set a new world record over the 500 
meters track Saturday, with a time of 44.690 seconds, on the second 
day of the short-track World Cup tournament, organizers said. The 
previous world record was held by Canadian Isabelle Charest, with 
44.867 seconds, since March, 1997. This was Radanova's second world 
record at the tournament after the Bulgarian skater broke the 1,500 
meters best mark on Friday. In the men's competition, Italy's Fabio 
Carta won in 42.468 seconds.
