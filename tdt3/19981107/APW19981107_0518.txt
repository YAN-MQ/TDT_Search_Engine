graf LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf, surprising herself, reached 
the final of the Leipzig Open Saturday as her latest comeback from 
injury continued to gather steam. The former world No. 1 needed one 
hour and 52 minutes to struggle past Belgium's Dominique van Roost, 
6-1, 3-6, 6-0 at the dlrs 450,000 event in her first tournament in 
two months. Graf, seizing on 12 double faults by the world's 13th-ranked 
player, said she hadn't expected this good of results so early in 
her latest comeback bid. ``I'm surprised. None of these matches were 
easy, I wasn't handed any points,'' said Graf, who had a operation 
for a bone spur on her right hand following the U.S. Open in late 
August. ``I'm trying to get back to the top, but I've had a lot of 
injuries the past few months. But I keep overcoming them and coming 
back,'' added Graf, 29. Graf, now ranked 22nd, faces match between 
top-ranked Nathalie Tauziat of France in Sunday's final. The Wimbledon 
finalist ousted Romania's Irina Spirlea, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2. Van Roost 
double faulted away the last point in a match that was tougher for 
Graf than the outcome indicated. Van Roost often dictated play against 
a tentative if steady Graf, catching the German flatfooted by blasting 
winners into the open court. ``I notice then that if I had played 
more in the last two, years, I might be able to hit shots with more 
precision and pressure,'' said Graf, whose career has been curtailed 
by injuries in recent years. Van Roost hit three double faults to 
hand Graf a 2-0 first set lead, then added two more as she gave the 
German a key 2-0 break in the final set. Graf, who helped found the 
Leipzig tournament, now boasts a 24-0 record at the event, where she 
had claimed four of her 104 career titles. The victory pushed Graf's 
record total career earnings to dlrs 20,366,842. Her victory Friday 
against France's Anne-Gaelle Sidot vaulted her past Martina Navratilova's 
13-year-old earnings mark of 20,344,061. ``Such records do show what 
you've achieved but they are not all that important to me,'' said 
Graf.
