Helmut Kohl bid a teary-eyed farewell as leader of Germany's conservative 
Christian Democrats on Saturday after guiding the party to its worst 
showing in a national election in nearly a half-century. Kohl's sentimental 
speech to about 1,000 party delegates launched them into their new 
role as German opposition after the defeat in Sept. 27 elections that 
unseated the chancellor after a record 16 years in office. Later, 
the party was expected to elect Kohl's hand-picked successor, Wolfgang 
Schaeuble, as chairman, with the former chancellor giving up the post 
he held for 25 years. Tears glistened on Kohl's jowls as one of his 
closest aides, former Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, praised his greatest 
achievement _ seizing the chance for German unification in 1990 after 
the fall of the Berlin Wall. For his part, Kohl accused Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder's new government of hewing to the left despite campaigning 
on a centrist platform. Unapologetic, he blamed his defeat on Germans 
unsettled by ``the dynamism of global change'' who had voted for a 
stronger government role in the economy. ``These parties offer the 
easier, more comfortable way,'' he asserted. ``Our course will prove 
to be the right one, and we will fight to make the majority of voters 
recognize this.'' He urged his party to stay true to its principles, 
including the free market, a commitment to social justice rooted in 
Christianity, and European unity. ``Let us not give in to pressure 
to run after changing trends of political fashion,'' he said. ``We 
need a renewal that will bear new fruit _ not one that rips out the 
roots.'' Kohl smiled and waved from the podium as delegates gave him 
a final, five-minute standing ovation. The one-day meeting is part 
of the nation's farewell to its longest-serving chancellor this century, 
whose bulky presence defined German politics from Oct. 1, 1982 until 
his defeat by Schroeder, a Social Democrat, six weeks ago. Schaeuble, 
a Kohl protege, is the point man for rejuvenating and modernizing 
the party after its worst showing in a national election in 49 years. 
A series of state elections next year will test the party's chances 
of survival. ``One should not have any illusions about the enormity 
of the challenge,'' he said recently. Schaeuble, 56, has been in a 
wheelchair since being shot by an apparently deranged man while campaigning 
in 1990. With Kohl gone, the gates have been opened for a group of 
young dissenters who lay the party's election defeat at his feet, 
saying he lost touch with the national mood by pushing historic goals 
such as unification and a single European Union currency. Known as 
the ``Wild Youth,'' many in their 40s, they chafed under the 68-year-old 
Kohl's iron-fisted hold on the party and now want a piece of the leadership 
pie. One of them, the party chief in Lower Saxony, 39-year-old Christian 
Wulff, is expected to be elected to one of the four deputy chairmanships. 
Most other top leadership posts are also being cleared for fresher 
faces.
