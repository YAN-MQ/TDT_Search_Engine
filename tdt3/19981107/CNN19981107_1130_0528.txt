Several thousand people turned out across Russia today to Mark the 
81st anniversary of the bolshevik revolution. Demonstrations were 
held in more than 200 Russian cities and in other former Soviet republics. 
The turnout was lighter than predicted. Many protesters were angry 
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. They blame him for country's 
economic collapse. In a television address, Yeltsin defended his reforms.
