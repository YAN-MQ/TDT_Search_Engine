In the statistical rankings that determine the level of draft-choice 
compensation for free agents, three teams each had 15 players emerge 
as Type A players. One, the New York Yankees, won the World Series. 
Another, the Cleveland Indians, lost to the Yankees in the American 
League Championship Series. The third was the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
``I don't know if I can call it underachieving,'' Kevin Malone, the 
Dodgers' new general manager, said of the third-place team. ``There 
were some guys who didn't live up to the expectations of others. But 
that's all past.'' The Dodgers' present began Friday. Deciding they 
couldn't sign both Randy Johnson and Bernie Williams, the Dodgers 
recruited Devon White to play center field for them. Six years older 
and less productive offensively than Williams, White cost about one-eighth 
as much as Williams might have. Now Malone can turn his attention 
to Johnson, whose lanky 6-foot-10-inch body could be a prized ornament 
on anyone's pitching staff. ``We do have the financial support in 
Los Angeles, but we also have to be fiscally responsible,'' Malone 
said. ``I'm going to go after the best players and do the best we 
can. But I will be well aware of what the price will be.'' Although 
the Fox Group bought the Dodgers from the O'Malley family before last 
season, next year's team will be the first bearing the indelible Fox 
imprint. The purge of O'Malley era employees is complete. The people 
in charge of the product on the field are not Dodgers' lifers. If 
the newcomers are to bleed Dodger blue, they will have to get a transfusion. 
Malone, from Baltimore out of Montreal, hired a manager who had been 
hired and basically fired in New York, Cincinnati and Baltimore. Davey 
Johnson, whose 10 full seasons of managing in the major leagues have 
ended in first or second place, is the best manager who has the toughest 
time securing and holding a job. He often is portrayed as being difficult 
for the front office to handle. ``I don't know how I got that reputation,'' 
he said. ``But I'm going to work on it.'' While he works on adding 
to his first-place finishes. Johnson could be expected to anticipate 
with delight the addition of a front-line pitcher or position player. 
But his thoughts as winter approaches are on different areas. ``Anybody 
can write down eight names and stick them in the lineup,'' Johnson 
said. ``It's kind of clearcut who the regulars are going to be. But 
it's the use of the bullpen and the bench that makes the difference. 
If the bullpen and the bench aren't flexible, you have troubles. ``Those 
are the areas that count late in the game with matchups and versatility. 
That can be the difference between winning and losing. A lot of times 
clubs just fill those roles with a rookie here, a rookie there. But 
I think it's the most important part of your club.'' Johnson cited 
the Yankees of the last three years as a team that has benefited from 
a strong bullpen and a good bench. ``I've tried to create that versatility 
on any team that I've managed,'' he said. Malone, who was the Orioles' 
assistant general manager during Johnson's two years as their manager, 
readily agreed with Johnson's view of those often overlooked elements 
of a team. He plans to upgrade those areas at the same time he seeks 
to fortify the starting lineup. Malone wanted to improve the defense 
in center field, and he did with the signing of White. He wants to 
balance the lineup by adding left-hand hitting, presumably more than 
White, who is a switch-hitter. Although he didn't say so, Malone ideally 
would like to sign the left-handed slugger Mo Vaughn to play first 
base and trade the right-hand hitting Karros. He also wants to trade 
Bobby Bonilla as part of his salary-saving strategy because the salary-spending 
strategy centers on signing Johnson. ``We have quality starters,'' 
Malone said, referring to Chan Ho Park, Carlos Perez, Ismael Valdes 
and Darren Dreifort. ``If you could add a front-line starter, it would 
make us even better.'' Most important, Malone said, is putting together 
the best group of people. ``We've seen that having the best players 
on a team doesn't guarantee a championship,'' he said. ``There are 
a lot of factors besides pure statistical information. There are some 
intangibles involved. When you add players in this day and age, you 
have to consider their makeup.'' Malone knows whereof he speaks. He 
saw baseball's highest payroll self-destruct last season in Baltimore. 
``We had too many selfish, egotistical players,'' he said. ``We didn't 
have one common goal to win. Everybody was more concerned about their 
individual stats. Not everybody, but we had too many individual players 
and not enough team players.''
