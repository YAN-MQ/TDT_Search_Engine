Malaysia is holding talks with the World Bank to secure a dlrs 700 
million loan from the institution, Malaysia's junior finance minister 
said Saturday. Malaysia obtained dlrs 300 million in credit to finance 
rural development and social spending plans in July. But further disbursements 
have been delayed by the country's decision to impose some controls 
on the flow of capital in early September. Talks on releasing the 
remaining amount were held between Mustapa Mohamed, the junior finance 
minister, and visiting World Bank vice president Jean-Michael Severino. 
``There's been some progress,'' Mustapa told reporters. ``We're working 
on the details of this lending.'' He stressed that the World Bank 
hadn't stopped the loans, because there hadn't been a definite agreement 
made to get further credit from the World Bank. Mustapa also reiterated 
that Malaysia won't remove its capital controls until there is a significant 
commitment from the world's leading economies to curb destabilizing 
capital flows. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad imposed the capital 
controls as part of his strategy to pull Malaysia out of its worst 
recession in more than a decade. On Saturday Mahathir ruled out relaxing 
currency controls for fear that the move could expose Malaysia once 
again to speculative attacks by currency traders. ``As long as currency 
trading is not regulated by the international community and certain 
countries, there is no guarantee that currency traders would not return 
to stage another attack once they have overcome their present problems,'' 
he said.
