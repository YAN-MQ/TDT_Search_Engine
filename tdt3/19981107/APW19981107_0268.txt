Portuguese are to vote in a referendum Sunday on whether to create 
regional assemblies which would be responsible for administration, 
planning and development policy in their areas. The proposal, backed 
by the Socialist government and the Portuguese Communist Party, would 
devolve limited administrative powers to elected assemblies in eight 
regions. The assemblies would recommend policies to the central government 
_ which would have the final say _ and then carry them out in conjunction 
with local councils. In the 15-nation European Union, only Portugal 
and Greece have maintained a centralized model of government. Even 
so, the center-right Social Democrat Party and the rightist Popular 
Party oppose the move, saying there is no need to divide up a country 
of just 9.9 million people. They insist the move will increase public 
spending and bureaucratic red tape. Supporters of the proposal say 
the move will bring democracy closer to the people and that the cost 
will be minimal. Neither side has said exactly how much they think 
it will cost. An opinion poll published last week by daily Publico 
found that 37 percent of those questioned were against the proposal, 
while 23 percent favored it. Of the 13,000 people questioned in the 
national survey, 27 percent did not know how they would vote, 11 percent 
said they did not intend to vote, and just over 1 percent said they 
would leave their ballot blank. The poll had a margin of error of 
3 percentage points. The ballot is also seen as a test for the policy 
of holding referendums, which were introduced last year. Almost 70 
percent of the country's 8.4 million eligible voters stayed away from 
the first-ever referendum, on abortion, in June. A referendum's result 
is binding only if more than half of registered voters participate. 
Final results of Sunday's referendum were expected Monday.
