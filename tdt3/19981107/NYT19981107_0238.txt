Boston College had lost five straight games while yielding an average 
of 35.3 points, and it seemed likely that the Eagles would be overmatched 
Saturday against Notre Dame. After all, the Irish were No. 8 in the 
New York Times computer ranking and No. 13 in the Associated Press 
poll, and came to Alumni Stadium with a 6-1 record that included five 
consecutive victories. But Notre Dame, leading by 31-26 in the final 
minute, had to muster a resolute goal-line stand to stop tailback 
Mike Cloud on three straight carries inside the 2-yard line _ the 
last time from a foot out with 6 seconds left _ before it could prevail 
in a pulsating contest. A crushing, low tackle by Notre Dame free 
safety Deke Cooper, who burst through the right side of the Boston 
College line, stopped Cloud for a 1-yard loss on fourth down to preserve 
the Irish victory. ``That was as fine a goal-line stand as I have 
been around,'' said Bob Davie, Notre Dame's second-year coach. ``In 
the back of my mind, I thought they might run the boot with their 
quarterback, who we had trouble tackling all day. But I knew they 
were going to give it to Cloud or run the boot, and we decided to 
go all goal-line defense and challenge them to throw it.'' Describing 
the loss as a ``tough ending to a great effort,'' Boston College Coach 
Tom O'Brien said of Cooper's tackle: ``It was a blown assignment and 
the guy came free. Mike didn't have a chance to get in. I thought 
he was in on third down, but I guess he wasn't. But he's my best back 
and he's going to get the ball in that situation.'' The play dashed 
the hopes of the Eagles, and most of those among a capacity crowd 
of 44,500, that the home team might replicate its stunning last-second 
victory over an undefeated Notre Dame team five years ago in South 
Bend, Ind. After falling behind by 31-20 early in the final quarter, 
Boston College (3-6) drew within 5 points with 5 minutes 23 seconds 
left when split end Anthony DiCosmo caught his second touchdown pass 
from quarterback Scott Mutryn, from 6 yards out, to cap a 68-yard 
drive. Then after forcing the Irish to punt, the Eagles drove from 
their 23-yard line to the Notre Dame 4. Mutryn completed four passes 
in the drive, the last for 26 yards to Rob Tardio. Cloud, who gained 
141 yards on 28 carries to surpass 100 yards for the eighth time this 
season, then plowed to the 2, was stopped for no gain and then plunged 
to the 1-foot line before he was stopped by Cooper on the climactic 
play. Mutryn, who has had an erratic season, was outstanding in defeat. 
The senior completed 22 of 35 passes for 318 yards and the 2 touchdowns 
to DiCosmo, who caught 8 passes for 140 yards. Mutryn also gained 
24 yards on 8 carries. Notre Dame quarterback Jarious Jackson also 
threw for 2 touchdowns while completing 11 of 21 passes for 210 yards. 
Jackson's passing was complemented by the running of Autry Denson, 
who picked up 128 yards on 28 rushes and scored twice. Boston College, 
which held a 17-14 halftime lead, outgained the Irish in net yards, 
491 to 383. Boston College recorded 26 first downs to 19 by Notre 
Dame, which now holds an 8-2 edge in the series.
