Democrats weren't shy with their opinions of Gingrich's decision. 
House minority leader Richard Gephardt says Gingrich's decision to 
step down is a real opportunity for a new start in the house. President 
Clinton also released a statement. It said -- Mr. Clinton also called 
Gingrich a "worthy adversary." Other democrats were less generous. 
Gingrich represented a point of view that was too extreme for the 
average american, and I am hopeful with a new speaker there can be 
far more bipartisanship, more being accomplished, and less of just 
democrats and republicans yelling at each other all day long and not 
getting anything done.
