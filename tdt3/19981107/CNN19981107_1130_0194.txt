Space shuttle "discovery" is on its way home. It's to land at the 
Kennedy space center in Florida in about half an hour. John Glenn 
and his crew mates wrapped up almost all of their experiments yesterday, 
but the testing on Glenn isn't over. He will wear a device to monitor 
his heart and blood pressure during the landing, and will undergo 
more tests in the weeks ahead. "CNN Headline News" will bring you 
live coverage of the landing.
