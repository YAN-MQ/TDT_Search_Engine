Seven nobel peace prize laureates are calling on China to find a peaceful 
resolution to the disputed region of Tibet. At a two-day conference 
at the University of Virginia, the Dalai Lama said he's seeking autonomous 
self-rule for the region and not independence. The Tibetan religious 
leader has lived in exile since 1959, but he says his relationship 
with the Chinese government is improving. Earlier this year, Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin offered to enter into talks if the Dalai Lama 
recognized Tibet and Taiwan as inseparable parts of china. I think 
there is a possibility to develop some kind of mutual trust. I feel 
that meeting person-to-person, regularly, often, that way so that 
way we can, that's the best way to eliminate suspicion. One of the 
obstacles between me and the Chinese government is too much suspicion 
is my feeling. Some of the nobel laureates also criticized the United 
States for refusing to support the worldwide land mine ban, exporting 
arms to the third world and spending too heavily on defense.
