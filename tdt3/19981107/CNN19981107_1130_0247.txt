President Clinton says upcoming enhancements to the Brady gun control 
law will keep weapons out of the hands of more criminals, but he says 
there's a Nagging loophole concerning gun shows that needs to be closed. 
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton explained why he is ordering 
the justice and treasury departments to crack down on transactions 
at those events. Every year, an untold number of firearms are bought 
and sold at an estimated 5,000 gun shows around the country. I come 
from a state where these shows are very popular. I have visited and 
enjoyed them over the years. They're often the first place parents 
teach their children how to handle firearms safely. I know most gun 
dealers and owners are dedicated to promoting safe and legal gun use. 
But at too many gun shows a different, dangerous trend is emerging. 
Because the law permits some firearms to be sold without background 
checks, some have become arms bazaars for traffickers, looking to 
sell guns on a Cash and carry, no questions asked basis. Mr. Clinton 
says the law of the land should be, no background check, no gun, no 
exceptions.
