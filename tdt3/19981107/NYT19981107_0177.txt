Drug dealers used to ply their trade openly there. And homeless people 
took up residence. But thanks to a police crackdown, those problems 
have abated. Still, Madison Square Park, a 6.2-acre swath of land 
between 23rd and 26th Streets, stretching from Madison Avenue to Broadway 
in Manhattan, is a far cry from the verdant gem it was in the 19th 
century. Its asphalt is cracked. Its irrigation is poor. There are 
missing benches, broken fences and poor landscaping. There's more 
dirt than green even in warmer seasons. But all that may soon change. 
The City Parks Foundation, a nonprofit organization that raises private 
funds to restore parks and to run park programs, collected $2.5 million 
to restore the park. That amount was matched by the city, with $1 
million coming from the mayor's budget, $1 million from the City Council 
and $500,000 from the Manhattan borough president's office. ``We want 
to restore the park to its former majesty,'' said Timothy Marshall, 
the project manager for the renovation and the former deputy administrator 
of Central Park. As he and Debbie Landau, executive director of the 
City Parks Foundation, strolled through the park on Friday, they rattled 
off facts about it and the surrounding neighborhood: The park is 150 
years old. It was built by Frederick Law Olmsted's assistant, Ignatz 
Pilat. Before it was a park, it was home to an arsenal, barracks and 
potter's field. Named for President James Madison, it has one of the 
largest collections of public art _ eight monuments and statues _ 
of any park its size. The hand and torch of the Statue of Liberty 
were on display there in an effort to raise money for the base of 
the Statue. There are over 200 trees. The neighborhood was once one 
of the city's most vibrant areas, a home to major hotels. Lady's Mile 
was visible from the park. Madison Square Garden was located there 
until 1925. Today, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York Life 
(both corporate sponsors of the restoration) and major toy companies 
line the edges of the park. New York Life donated $420,000, and Met 
Life, $1,415,000. Robert Benmosche, chairman and chief executive officer 
of Met Life, said contributing to the park was not a difficult decision 
since the company's buildings are on the perimeter of the park. ``The 
key was getting our neighbors to do the same,'' he said. ``The park 
was gorgeous when Madison Square Garden was here. We want to make 
sure it looks beautiful because we have a large number of associates, 
customers and tenants coming into our buildings.'' In warm temperatures, 
employees from the toy and insurance companies use the park, as do 
neighborhood residents, particularly dog owners. ``It's one of the 
most used dog runs in the city,'' Marshall said. Danny Meyer, who 
co-owns the Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern, donated $60,000 
to the park's renovation. He recently opened a restaurant which overlooks 
Madison Square Park, and is about to open another. The restaurant, 
Eleven Madison Park, features photographs depicting the history of 
the park and the surrounding neighborhood. In two to three weeks, 
Meyer plans to open another restaurant, called Tabla. It, too, will 
have a park view. ``The whole reason for Eleven Madison Park is to 
rekindle the celebratory spirit and hospitality that the area had 
100 years ago,'' he said. ``The park is part of our decor, part of 
our ambience. I can't understand why any commercial or residential 
building would not want to invest in the park, since it's our front 
yard. We want to take a page out of the Bryant Park playbook.'' After 
that park in midtown was cleaned up and landscaped, he said, ``it 
became the heart of the community's revival.'' Marshall and Ms. Landau 
envision a European-style park, with ornate lampposts, decorative 
plantings, old-fashioned benches, new signs on the perimeter, a renovated 
fountain on the south end and perhaps a new fountain on the the north 
end. (``Water helps drown out urban noise,'' Marshall said.) The statues, 
including Augustus Saint-Gaudens' Admiral Farragut, will be cleaned 
and waxed. The maintenance station, currently an eyesore on the south 
end, will be moved underground. The corner of 23rd Street and Madison 
Avenue is expected to be transformed from a motorcycle parking lot 
into a formal entrance to the park, adding about a third of an acre 
of parkland, and squaring the corner. ``The park will be superior 
to nearby Gramercy Park,'' said Henry Stern, the city parks commissioner, 
referring to a private park open to residents of certain buildings. 
``And it will be open to the public. There are bright days ahead for 
Madison Square Park.'' The City Parks Foundation will embark on a 
campaign to raise $1 million dollars for maintenance of the park, 
as well as a $5-million endowment. ``We don't want to be in a position 
of build and decline, build and decline,'' Ms. Landau said.
