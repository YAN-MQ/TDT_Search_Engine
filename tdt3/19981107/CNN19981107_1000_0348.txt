The United States reportedly is considering extraditing former Chilean 
dictator augusto Pinochet to answer questions about the deaths of 
three americans. "The Miami Herald" reports, federal authorities are 
checking to see if pinochet is implicated in a 1976 Washington car 
bombing that killed a Chilean exile leader and an American. Federal 
authorities are also reportedly looking into possible links between 
pinochet and the 1973 deaths of two Americans in Chile. Pinochet is 
currently being held in Britain. Spanish authorities want to extradite 
him and try him on charges of human rights abuses.
