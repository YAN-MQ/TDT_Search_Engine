There's another sign things are getting a little more tense in Iraq. 
The United Nations has started pulling some of its weapons inspectors 
out of the country. Jane arraf reports. 15 inspectors left Baghdad, 
the first of about a quarter of the 120-member staff that will be 
withdrawn over the next few days. UNSCOM says they've been wasting 
their time since Iraq put a halt to weapons inspections last week. 
It's that ban that has the U.S. beating the war Drums. U.S. defense 
secretary William Cohen returned after touring the region to rally 
support for an attack if Baghdad doesn't back down. There's some question 
as to what a military strike on Baghdad would accomplish. Despite 
Baghdad's rejection of the latest idea, the fight for a diplomatic 
solution continues. The U.N.'s special envoy for Iraq, prakash Shah, 
has been meeting with deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz in an attempt 
to avert a military strike. The secretary general and I are pursuing 
that matter. The bottom line, diplomats say -- Iraq wants clear assurances 
that the U.S. won't block easing of sanctions if Iraq is seen to have 
complied with weapons resolutions. Without that, they won't even consider 
resuming cooperation, no matter what the consequences. A military 
strike is a strike that we have faced many times. We are not fearing 
of any military strike, and we are ready to confront any military 
strike. On the street, where political rhetoric is often betrayed 
by the price of flour, there seems to be confidence that Iraq would 
weather this storm. Wholesalers said unlike in previous times of crisis, 
there was little stockpiling, and prices were holding steady. Some 
things still thrive under sanctions, like these Iraqis doing their 
best to drown out the rumblings of war. Jane arraf, CNN, Baghdad.
