This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast," Saturday into Sunday. A wintry storm is moving across the 
rocky mountains and will move through the plains states, bringing 
some of the first snow of the season into parts of Iowa and on into 
the Great Lakes region. The east coast stays quiet and dry, but there 
is another front that'll move across the west with more wet and windy 
weather, and, of course, mountain snow. High temperatures today, 20s 
and 30s across the north central U.S. 30s over northern New England, 
but most of the rest of the east, except Florida, will see 40s and 
50s. It'll be pretty cool out across the west. Looking ahead to Monday 
-- it looks like a wet or snowy day across much of the nation. On 
Tuesday, wet weather, especially for the Great Lakes, although it 
does warm up a bit. We'll see rain in the northwest with mountain 
snow. And on Wednesday, 30s in the north, 60s and 70s in the south, 
and a wet day in the east and northwest. Don't forget, you can find 
four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities at cNN.com.
