Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet says he feels betrayed 
by Britain, in his first public statement since his arrest in a London 
hospital last month, a newspaper reported. ``I am saddened that the 
experience of my arrest has shaken my belief in Britain ... I did 
not believe that I would be the subject of spurious attempts by foreign 
prosecutors to convict me on unproven charges,'' early editions of 
The Sunday Times quoted Pinochet as saying in a four-page statement. 
The newspaper said it received the statement Saturday from a public 
relations company acting as an intermediary for the general. A copy 
of the statement was sent to The Associated Press. British police 
arrested Pinochet, 82, on Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish 
magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism 
and torture. Chile's secret police are accused of committing the crimes 
after Pinochet seized power in 1973, toppling President Salvador Allende, 
an elected Marxist. The Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could 
be broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared 
during his 17-year-rule. Pinochet's statement said that his arrest 
would undermine attempts to achieve reconciliation within Chile, and 
it compared the South American country's predicament with that in 
Northern Ireland and South Africa. ``Today, we understand that reconciliation 
is essential to peace. That is the lesson that we have learned from 
two world wars and from numerous other conflicts this century,'' the 
statement said. ``In challenging Chile's reconciliation, Spain ignores 
it own past,'' the statement said, referring to the 1939-1975 fascist 
regime of late Gen. Francisco Franco in Spain. ``Chile deserves the 
same rights as any other country,'' the statement said. Pinochet stepped 
down in 1990, but remained commander-in-chief of the army until March 
as part of compromises in Chile's transition to democracy. In the 
statement, Pinochet said that he would fight extradition to Spain 
``with all my spirit,'' adding, ``a show trial in a foreign land is 
not justice. It is certainly not British justice.'' Pinochet was recovering 
Oct. 9 from back surgery when his wife, Lucia Hiriart, explained to 
him the reasons for his arrest. ``She was in tears as she tried to 
speak. I was hurt, and bewildered,'' Pinochet's statement said. Pinochet's 
legal fate in the hands of Britain. The English High Court has ruled 
that Pinochet's arrest was illegal because he is entitled to immunity 
as a former head of state. A five-judge panel from Britain's House 
of Lords is hearing an appeal. The general remains under police guard 
in a north London hospital. Pablo Longueira, a right-wing Chilean 
congressman who visited Pinochet on Saturday, told Radio Cooperativa 
of Santiago by telephone that he found the former general to be ``in 
a much better mood ... but he is indeed worried about what comes next 
week.''
