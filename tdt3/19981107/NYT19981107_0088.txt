Russia's Communists went looking last week for someone to blame for 
the nation's economic morass, and after an extraordinary discourse 
freighted with memories of the Soviet past, they found a candidate: 
the Jews. For that they were swiftly condemned, most notably in a 
blunt statement by President Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin said he was ``indignant'' 
at what seemed a revival of Soviet anti-Semitism. ``Extremism will 
not take the upper hand in Russia,'' he stated. ``The course of the 
country toward conciliation remains unchanged.'' But in a debate in 
the lower house of Parliament, Communist legislators had pressed the 
argument that Jews in the government and the media were aligned with 
outsiders in a campaign to undermine Russian nationalism and sap the 
country's strength. Parliament took two days last week to decide whether 
to condemn anti-Semitic statements made last month by a Communist 
legislator, Albert Makashov. In Moscow and in the southwestern city 
of Samara, Makashov proclaimed that Russia's economic woes were the 
fault of the ``zhidy'' _ a slur for Jews _ and that certain of them 
should be found and jailed. Makashov later expressed regret, saying 
he should have used the term ``Zionists.'' But he also called for 
a debate, saying it would make clear who really controls Russia. Parliament 
wrangled over endorsing a resolution that deplored racism and called 
the remarks ``sharp and bordering on crudeness,'' but it failed to 
pass by a vote of 107-121. Only one Communist voted for it; 83 opposed 
it and the remaining 46 either abstained or did not vote. Hard-line 
nationalist factions also voted against the measure almost unanimously. 
Even the moderate party Our Russian Home mustered fewer than half 
its members in support of the statement. The Communist Party chairman, 
Gennady Zyuganov, said that Makashov had been censured privately and 
that only a task force was needed to examine ethnic tensions, but 
several of his legislators praised Makashov. One, Gennady Benov, called 
Zionism ``more frightening than fascism because it operates from the 
flanks, clandestinely and secretly.'' Other Communists took aim at 
journalists, saying they would bring charges against prominent television 
reporters for ``their active and deliberate support of the regime 
and its criminal activities.'' Zyuganov called for journalists to 
publicly apologize for their reporting. The resolution's backers, 
who had cast it as a referendum on racism, were bitter. ``It's distressing 
and dangerous when the Parliament of a multiethnic country opts for 
state anti-Semitism,'' one legislator, Stanislav Govorukhin, said 
later. Anti-Semitism is hardly new in Russia. Jews were widely persecuted 
and denied basic rights in czarist and Soviet times, and even in independent 
Russia there has been an undercurrent of resentment against Jews in 
powerful state and business positions. But until now it had remained 
in the background of national political debate. The targets were not 
named. But among the prominent national figures here who are either 
Jewish or of Jewish extraction are Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's former 
finance minister and an architect of free-market reforms; Sergei Kiriyenko 
and Yevgeny Primakov, the former and current prime ministers; Alexander 
Livshits, a former economic adviser, and several so-called oligarchs 
who dominate Russian industry. They include Boris Berezovsky, once 
a key Yeltsin supporter, and Vladimir Guzinsky, a prominent Jewish 
activist who owns television and newspaper empires in Israel and Russia. 
Yeltsin was not alone in his condemnation. Russia's highest-ranking 
Communist, Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, said Friday that 
the Parliament's decision not to condemn Makashov was ``a disgrace, 
simply a disgrace.'' One of the best-known television journalists, 
Yevgeny Kiselyov, lashed out at the Communists, saying the vote marked 
``their blackest day in history.''
