Days after winning his first term in the house, Greg Walden delivered 
the republican radio address. She shared lessons from the campaign 
trail. Americans want a strong economy, tax cuts for the middle class, 
and improvements in education. He also made an appeal to President 
Clinton. Mr. president, I ask you to join us in dedicated the next 
two years not to partisanship or posturing, but to real, honest to 
goodness problem solving, where we debate policies. We reference our 
differences in philosophy, but work together towards solutions. House 
majority leader Dick Armey picked Walden for the address to introduce 
a fresh new face to a national audience.
