Six days after divorcing his wife of 38 years, former President F.W. 
de Klerk on Saturday married his Greek-born sweetheart, a Johannesburg 
newspaper reported. De Klerk, who presided over the end of apartheid 
and shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, wed Elita 
Georgiades in a private Greek Orthodox ceremony near Hermanus on the 
south coast, according to an early edition of the Sunday Times. De 
Klerk, 62, confirmed his marriage to Georgiades, 46, the newspaper 
said. ``We had planned a very private place and we didn't want it 
public,'' De Klerk was quoted as saying. De Klerk announced earlier 
this year that he had been in love with Georgiades for many years. 
She was divorced in August. The former president has largely stepped 
back from politics, but last week successfully blocked the publication 
of negative findings about his role in apartheid-era human rights 
abuses. Through legal action, De Klerk forced the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission to excise references to the former president before releasing 
its historic report last month.
