The space shuttle "discovery" is back on earth after nine days in 
orbit. John Glenn and his six crewmates touched down a few minutes 
afternoon eastern time at the Kennedy space center in Florida. Moments 
after landing, Glenn said he feels fine and offered his thanks and 
appreciation to all those who made it a successful flight. We're now 
looking at live pictures at the Kennedy space center and waiting for 
the astronauts to disembark. Glenn will undergo more medical tests 
now that he's back on earth to see how his body held up during the 
flight. Mission control says the landing went smoothly. Main gear 
touchdown. There was no need to jettison the drag chute that NASA 
feared might accidentally deploy.
