It may seem an odd symbol for a political party to pin its hopes on, 
but the "Titanic" has found its way into Taiwan's general election. 
The democratic Progressive party held a "Titanic"-themed campaign 
rally yesterday where party leaders dressed up as captains of the 
ill-fated cruise ship. The dpp hopes to capitalize on Taiwan's enthusiasm 
for the movie, "Titanic" by using the buzzword "kitanic" as its campaign 
theme. The prefix "ki" means "gold" or "creativity" in Chinese.
