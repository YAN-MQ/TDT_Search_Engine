First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled the latest works of art 
for the White House sculpture garden Friday. The new exhibit is inspired 
by the work of rodin, whose famous figure "the thinker" is the centerpiece. 
Mrs. Clinton has a soft spot for sculpture. She says on her first 
date with the president, the pair got into the Yale university art 
gallery by offering to pick up garbage in the sculpture garden.
