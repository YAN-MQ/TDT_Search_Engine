David Stern authorized team officials to explain the owners' proposal 
to players last week, lifting a moratorium that began July 1. Depending 
on whose side you are on in the National Basketball Association's 
labor dispute, it was either a gesture on the league commissioner's 
part to educate the masses or a scheme to divide the players union. 
Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, retaliated by saying 
he would mail out the union's proposals to the league's general managers. 
``We'll have them attach to it the NBA's proposal, and they can judge 
for themselves which one is better,'' Hunter said. Election day has 
come and gone, but in the NBA the campaigning goes on and on. They 
are playing games in November, all right. With the regular season 
wiped out until at least until Dec. 8, the boardroom has become the 
focal point in a battle to sway the league's middle class. After a 
week of no progress on economic issues and with no clear date when 
talks will resume, Stern has become fond of calling recent negotiations 
``Groundhog Day,'' referring to the Bill Murray movie in which the 
main character wakes up to Feb. 2 day after day. It is one point he 
and Hunter agree on. ``It's not that we're going backward, we're just 
running in place,'' Hunter said. The stalemate has left both sides 
time to expound on their idea of what a good deal represents. For 
the league, which is proposing to limit the salaries of upper-echelon 
players, it means grabbing a bigger portion of revenues while claiming 
to raise the income of the league's journeymen. ``For the vast majority 
of players, and I mean like 80 or 90 percent, there is absolutely 
nothing in that deal that is not really good for that group of players,'' 
Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, said last week. ``Whether they 
would vote for it or not out of concern for the high-end salary players, 
I don't know. But for the vast majority of players, it would be hard 
for me to conceive of any reason why they would not endorse the deal 
at least as it would affect them over the next six years.'' For the 
union, which does not want to drastically alter a system that resulted 
in the players taking in more than 57 percent of basketball-related 
income last season, it means finding a way to appease the owners while 
not sacrificing too much. Proving that the NBA is indeed a league 
of haves and have-nots, Michael Jordan made $33 million last season, 
while the median salary hovered around $1.3 million. Nearly 30 percent 
of the players last season were paid the league minimum salary of 
$272,500. ``The deal they are currently proposing barely helps the 
middle class,'' Hunter said. ``Plain and simple, the concessions they 
want us to make would hurt everybody.'' Even the agent David Falk 
_ whose clients include Jordan and Patrick Ewing, the union president 
_ has begun campaigning. Singled out by Stern for sabotaging a potential 
deal last week, Falk has been characterized as having only his supernova 
clients' interests at stake. ``The problem the agents have with the 
escrow arrangement is, they are concerned about a real limit on salaries,'' 
a participant in the negotiations said. ``So if $15 million is the 
most, say, Tim Duncan can make, then why would a player pay an agent 
4 percent of his salary? Why wouldn't he just get a lawyer to look 
the contract over? The superstar agents are afraid this deal would 
make them less valuable in the marketplace.'' Falk responded: ``Honestly, 
I'm not worried about fees. We're going to make tons of money off 
our players on the marketing side. We're worried about a fair deal.'' 
Like Stern and Hunter, Falk is trying to make his case before the 
people, too. He said he is planning to stage his own all-star exhibition 
game in two to three weeks, a game that may include several members 
of the original Olympic Dream Team, including Jordan. A site has not 
yet been determined, but a charity has: NBA players. ``Just as the 
league has gotten a great cushion from television, we have to create 
cushions for the players in case this goes longer,'' he said. Without 
any budging at the bargaining table and the season held hostage at 
least until mid-December, it appears no tactic or convention is off 
limits anymore.
