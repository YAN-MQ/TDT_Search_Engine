Thousands of people opposed to the leftist government's proposal to 
give legal status to unmarried couples marched through Paris Saturday 
as opposition lawmakers waged a pitched parliamentary battle to kill 
the bill. The right has proposed more than 1,000 amendments to the 
bill -- known as the Civil Solidarity Pact, or PACS -- that the leftist 
government hopes to adopt Tuesday. But a barrage of delaying tactics, 
including marathon debates, stands in the way. Last Tuesday, centrist 
deputy Christine Boutin, one of the bill's most outspoken opponents 
in parliament, denounced the proposal in a speech that lasted more 
than five hours. Another planned five-hour speech Saturday was cut 
short by Speaker Laurent Fabius after just three hours. Meanwhile, 
opponents made themselves heard in the streets where thousands of 
people from around France marched against the bill. Opponents contend 
the measure strikes at the heart of French values and could lead to 
homosexual adoptions. Carrying signs reading ``PACS Attack'' and ``Love 
Doesn't PACS,'' demonstrators marched through the Left Bank to the 
esplanades of the Invalides, site of Napoleon's tombe. Police put 
the number of protesters at just over 7,000, while organizers said 
there were 130,000 people in the streets. The proposal was initially 
scuttled by rightist politicians Oct. 9. The government of Socialist 
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said it has made only minor changes to 
the bill. The revised bill would allow two unrelated people to conclude 
a union that would, among other things, allow them to file joint tax 
returns, gain inheritance benefits, and take part in the other's social 
security coverage. Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou on Friday called 
for an end to ``fantasies'' over the legislation. ``The real debate,'' 
she said, ``is that we must be able to recognize the rights of people 
who live together without being married, be they homosexual or heterosexual, 
or be they people without carnal ties.''
