Awesome Again lived up to his name while Skip Away failed to earn 
anything for a hard day's work at the Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs. 
Trainer Bob Baffert, winner of the last two Kentucky Derbies, scored 
a 1-2 finish with Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting in the Juvenile 
Fillies. But he had to settle for second with Silver Charm in Saturday's 
marquee race _ the dlrs 5.12 million Classic. It appeared Silver Charm 
was going to win, but Awesome Again shot between Charm and Coronado's 
Quest and nailed the dlrs 2,662,400 first-place price and remained 
unbeaten in six starts this year. Awesome Again and Silver Charm will 
return to the racing wars next year, but it was a sad farewell for 
the 5-year-old Skip Away and the 6-year-old Gentlemen. Skip Away staggered 
home sixth and failed to become the first American horse to earn dlrs 
10 million. Skippy leaves with dlrs 9,616,360, second to Cigar, the 
earning leader with dlrs 9,999,815. ``I knew 50 yards in the race 
I was in trouble,'' said Jerry Bailey, Skip Away's rider. ``He just 
could not handle this track.'' It was the first time in 27 races dating 
back to a 12th-place finish in the 1996 Kentucky Derby that Skip Away 
has finished worse than third. Gentlemen, whose owner R.D. Hubbard 
paid dlrs 800,000 to supplement because neither the horse nor his 
sire had been nominated, finished last in the 10-horse field. Awesome 
Again's victory, worth a winning mutuel of dlrs 11.40, was accomplished 
in 2 minutes, 2.16 seconds and was the 10th Breeders' Cup victory 
for Day, the most for any jockey. It was his third victory in the 
Classic. Bob Barnett, a former D. Wayne Lukas assistant, won the Juvenile 
with Answer Lively, his first starter in a Breeders' Cup race, while 
Lukas failed to get his sixth Juvenile victory with five starters. 
Answer Lively took the lead in the upper stretch and held on for a 
head victory over 70-1 shot Aly's Alley. The Lukas-trained Cat Thief 
was third in a 13-horse field. In a remarkable comeback, Da Hoss, 
who was racing for only the second time since winning the 1996 Mile 
because of injuries, won the Mile again in a breathtaking stretch 
duel with Hawksley Hill. Da Hoss, ridden by John Velazquez and trained 
by Britain's Michael W. Dickinson, got up in the final stride and 
won by a head in 1:35.27 on grass. Labeeb finished third in the 14-horse 
field. Favorite Trick, the 1997 Juvenile winner, finished eighth in 
a bid to become the first winner of two different Breeders' Cup races. 
Reraise won the Sprint, giving jockey Corey Nakatani his third straight 
win in the race. Escena won the Distaff and Buck's Boy won the Turf. 
Answer Lively, owned by John Franks, gave jockey Jerry Bailey his 
second Juvenile victory in a winning time of 1:44 over 1.7 kilometers 
(1 1-16 miles). Aly's Alley paid dlrs 40 to place on a dlrs 2 wager. 
The order of finish for Lukas' other starters was Tactical Cat (eighth), 
Mountain Range (ninth), Yes It's True (11th) and Time Bandit (13th). 
Reraise, a 3-year-old gelding, who was supplemented for dlrs 120,000, 
took charge with 800 meters (a half mile) to go and won the 1.2-kilometer 
(six-furlong) Sprint by two lengths over Grand Slam in 1:09.07. Buck's 
Boy, ridden by Shane Sellers, won the turf by 1 1-4 lengths over Yagli 
in a dawdling time of 2:28.74. Dushyantor finished third and defending 
champion Chief Bearheart was fourth in the 13-horse field. None of 
the six European-based horses in the race made a serious bid for victory. 
It was the third victory in four starts for Buck's Boy. The Distaff 
had a dlrs 2 million purse. The Sprint was worth dlrs 1.1 million; 
the Mile and the two 2-year-old races each were worth dlrs 1 million.
