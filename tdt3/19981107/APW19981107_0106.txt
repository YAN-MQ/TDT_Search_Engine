Government troops have encircled bands of rebel fighters in two northern 
outposts and appeared poised Saturday to put down the latest revolt 
in the restive Central Asian nation. More than 200 combatants and 
civilians have been killed since the rebels launched raids in the 
northern part of the country Wednesday, renewing concerns about the 
government's ability to maintain order. After suffering losses at 
the beginning of the fighting, the government forces have surrounded 
the rebels in the northern city of Khudzhand and the village of Aini, 
news reports said. In Khudzhand, the site of the first attack on Wednesday, 
about 40 rebels were holed up in an old fortress in the city center. 
Government troops have retaken the rest of the city, but have not 
attempted to storm the fortress because it is well fortified and the 
rebels were holding captured soldiers as hostages, official said. 
Khudzhand is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital 
Dushanbe. Meanwhile, government forces have surrounded a second group 
of rebels, numbering 200 to 300 in Aini, a village about 160 kilometers 
(100 miles) north of the capital, presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov 
was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies reported. The rebels 
are led by former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, who has demanded 
that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political prisoners and 
bring his supporters into the government. Rakhmonov firmly ruled out 
any talks with the rebels, saying the government will destroy or capture 
them all. Khudoberdyev claimed his guerrillas had mined the dam on 
the Kairakkhum reservoir, and threatened to set off explosions that 
would ``flood vast territories of Central Asia.'' The Kairakkhum reservoir 
is so large it is referred to locally as a ``sea.'' But the government 
said army forces were protecting the dam and it was not in danger 
of sabotage. A peace treaty signed last year formally ended five years 
of civil war between Rakhmonov's hardline, secular government and 
the mostly Muslim opposition. The main opposition groups are now participating 
in the government and the armed forces. However, a number of warlords 
have refused to recognize the peace deal and periodically launch small-scale 
rebellions. The war, which began shortly after the country received 
independence from the Soviet Union, has badly damaged the economy 
in the poor, mountainous nation.
