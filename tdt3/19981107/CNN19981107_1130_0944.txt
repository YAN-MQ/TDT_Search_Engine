There's an increasing chance your commercial airline flight could 
be interrupted by something as simple as an odor. Pilots are taking 
the smell of smoke in the cockpit much more seriously these days. 
Dan Ronan has today's edition of "working ahead." Pilots say smoke 
in the cockpit and being forced to make an unscheduled landing can 
be one of the scariest situations they'll deal with. Not only may 
the plane have a malfunction, but the pilot's visibility and ability 
to breathe can be hampered. All of the electrical connections come 
into the cockpit or come into a Compartment underneath the cockpit. 
So if there's an electrical short, you're going to get some kind of 
a Smell, just like if you get a short in the wiring in your house. 
It doesn't necessarily start a fire, but you'll have that -- that 
acrid smell. In the two months since the Swissair accident, there 
have been at least eight unscheduled landings because of smoke in 
the cockpit. That's twice as many as the FAA usually receives. Aviation 
experts say while the rules for landing a plane with smoke in the 
cockpit have not changed, because of the Swissair crash, pilots may 
be more conservative. When an accident, any kind of accident happens, 
people become more sensitive to those kinds of incidents. And smoke 
in the cockpit, of course, is one of the really scary things for a 
pilot. Adding to the equation, many say the mainstream media are more 
aggressive about reporting aviation issues. But the airlines we spoke 
to do confirm they're telling their pilots, "if there's smoke in the 
cockpit, don't take chances, land the plane." Dan Ronan, CNN, Atlanta.
