A new Cold War has broken out between Russia and the United States, 
this time over hot-rolled steel. More than just steel is at stake 
in the trade dispute, which is sure to drag in both governments before 
it is over. The case turns on jobs and profits, but also on politics 
as it tests the U.S. government's support for Russia's painful economic 
transition. Earlier this year, U.S. steel producers became alarmed 
about a surge in inexpensive steel imports. As imports rose to record 
levels, prices fell _ from $300 a ton, to $220 for the hot-rolled 
coils that make up 55 percent of the American steel market. On Sept. 
30, U.S. steelmakers brought an anti-dumping case in Washington against 
Russia, Japan and Brazil, contending that their foreign competitors 
are selling steel below cost in the United States, at grave damage 
to the domestic industry. Russia is not the biggest exporter of hot-rolled 
steel to the United States. Japan is. But squeezed by a drop in domestic 
demand and a collapse of their markets in Southeast Asia, Russian 
producers have significantly stepped up their shipments to the United 
States. Imports of Russian steel rose to 2.2 million tons in the first 
seven months of 1998 from 1.8 million tons in the corresponding period 
last year. Seen from Magnitogorsk _ often dubbed the Pittsburgh of 
Russia _ exports to the United States are a matter of survival, as 
hopes for reviving the domestic market have been dashed by the economy. 
Magnitogorsk now sells 60 percent of the steel it produces abroad, 
of which 49 percent goes to the United States. Nationally, Russian 
steelworkers have warned that losing the American market could cost 
them 100,000 jobs, and $1 billion a year in earnings. Seen from Pittsburgh, 
headquarters of USX-U.S. Steel Group, which in the last decade has 
gone through a painful transition of its own, the Russians' aggressive 
sales techniques amount to dumping. ``We have seen some horribly low 
prices that to our knowledge, are below the cost of producing a ton 
of steel,'' said Paul J. Wilhelm, president of USX-U.S. Steel. ``There 
is a tremendous surge in imports that is coming out of the hides of 
U.S. steelmakers, and U.S. steel workers.'' Russian steel producers 
insist they are not producing below cost, especially with the ruble 
devalued by 60 percent. ``To say there is no free market in Russia 
is absurd,'' said Mikhail Buryakov, director of Magnitogorsk Metal 
Works' finance and economics department. But Russia's economy is weighted 
down by barter transactions _ at this point, 40 percent of Magnitogorsk's 
domestic transactions are conducted in kind, not cash. So calculating 
production costs is no easy task. ``We cannot afford to sell for less 
than it costs to produce,'' said Serafim Afonin, president of the 
Russian Union of Metal Exporters. ``Exports are our only way of getting 
real money.'' In an effort to forestall heavy anti-dumping penalties, 
the Russian producers have offered to cut their exports to 1997 levels, 
which by their estimates would amount to a 30 percent cut from monthly 
volumes in the first half of this year. But U.S. steelmakers say they 
will oppose any quotas or any government-brokered deals. Mainly the 
Russians want their case to be set aside, and considered in light 
of their peculiar economic difficulties, which in their view resulted 
from reforms urged on them by the Americans. The case is now under 
review by the Commerce Department and a preliminary find is expected 
soon. ``Let us take a look at the transformations that have taken 
place, in the name of free, open market reforms,'' said Afonin. ``They 
said, open your markets, and we did. Now they want to hit us over 
the head. If the Americans want Russia's reforms to continue, they 
should understand.''
