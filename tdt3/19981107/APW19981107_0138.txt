The World Wide Fund for Nature has renewed its criticism of Japan's 
whaling, saying the purchase of a new multi-million dollar catcher 
boat proves it isn't just interested in scientific research. The Japanese 
fleet _ a factory ship with three catcher boats and one sighting boat 
_ has just departed for its annual hunt in the Antarctic region. Last 
season it caught 438 minke whales in the area. ``The launch of this 
new boat shows Japanese research whaling is becoming more aggressive,'' 
said WWF's Cassandra Phillips in a statement issued Friday. The International 
Whaling Commission has declared the Southern Ocean a whale sanctuary. 
It has condemned Japan for whaling under the guise of ``research programs.'' 
The whaling commission banned commercial whaling worldwide in 1986. 
The Japanese government and fishing industry argues it needs to continue 
the hunt for scientific purposes. Whale meat is popular in Japan.
