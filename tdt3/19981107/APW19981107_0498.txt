Greece's Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA _ or OTE _ won 
Saturday the right to buy a 35 percent stake in the state telecommunication 
operator RomTelecom, privatization authorities said. ``OTE offered 
the best price possible on the market at this moment,'' Communications 
Minister Sorin Pantis told private radio ProFM. OTE, Greece's state-owned 
company, offered for RomTelecom's stake dlrs 675 million, and the 
contract signed Saturday stipulates that OTE will invest another dlrs 
400 million over the next three years as needed to expand its activities. 
Romanian privatization authorities, represented by the Privatization 
Ministry and the State Ownership Fund, were to sign next week with 
OTE a first contract on the privatization deal. The remainder of RomTelecom 
will be sold in installments of 20 percent each year over the next 
three years. Only Italy's STET International and OTE competed for 
the stake in RomTelecom. ``STET's offer did not include a bank guarantee 
and did not specify any sum,'' Pantis said. RomTelecom's is considered 
Romania's biggest privatization deal to date. RomTelecom has 50,000 
employees and holds the communication monopoly in Romania. The company 
reported in 1997 a turnover of lei 6,130 billion (almost dlrs 645 
million) and a net profit of lei 706 billion (almost dlrs 74 million).
