When the assets of the National Herald go up for sale next week, among 
the momentos from the once illustrious newspaper will be a table and 
chair used by a noted reporter, Jawaharlal Nehru. A court has ordered 
the paper and its sister publications to sell off their stocks to 
pay three years of accumulated electricity and telephone bills, the 
salaries of 538 employees that have gone unpaid for 22 months, and 
other debts totaling 60 million rupees (dlrs 1.43 million). An auction 
was scheduled for Nov. 9. It's a sad end to a paper venerated by many 
Indians as a weapon in their independence fight against Britain, and 
which was the proud organ of the Congress Party when Nehru was the 
unchallenged leader of the party and the nation. The National Herald 
is the flagship of Associated Journals Ltd., which also owns a Hindi- 
and an Urdu-language daily. All three papers shut down in Lucknow 
two months ago, but the New Delhi edition of the English paper still 
prints about 500 copies daily. The group is run by a trust founded 
by Nehru and now controlled by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of Nehru's 
grandson Rajiv Gandhi and current head of the Congress Party. ``The 
newspapers' employees are starving and had approached the High Court, 
which ordered the state government of auction off the movable properties,'' 
said Shyama Charan Tiwari, an editor of the Hindi-language Navjeevan. 
An auction notice was posted on the imposing gates of the colonial-era 
four-story office of Associated Journals announcing the sale of furniture, 
rare books and manuscripts, as well as computers and laser printers. 
The National Herald was founded in Lucknow in 1938 by two prominent 
members of the Congress Party, which was the engine of India's independence 
movement. The headquarters shifted to New Delhi, 410 kilometers (255 
miles) to the west, in 1963. ``Whenever Nehru was in Lucknow, he would 
write out news reports on meetings held by Congress leaders or articles 
of India's freedom struggle in his own hand while sitting among other 
sub editors and reporters,'' said Gurcharan Rai, who at 71 is one 
of the paper's oldest employees. Although the paper had a pro-national 
line, it remained editorially independent until the early 1970's, 
when Nehru's daughter and political heir, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, 
used it for her own agenda. Circulation began to fall. The paper was 
threatened with closure once before. An auction was due to be held 
in 1987, but it was scheduled for the birthday of then-Prime Minister 
Rajiv Gandhi _Indira's son. As a birthday gift, Congress leaders collected 
the money to pay enough bills to keep the paper going.
