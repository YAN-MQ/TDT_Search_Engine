In the sea of red banners and angry faces that flowed through an overcast 
Moscow on Saturday to mark what used to be the premier feast of Soviet 
communism, Revolution Day, one of the few slogans with a constructive 
bent was the old chestnut from 1917: ``All Power to the Soviets.'' 
But after chanting the line a few times with her fist held high, an 
elderly woman wearing a frayed cloth coat with a red ribbon in the 
lapel was hard pressed to explain exactly what this meant in the current 
circumstances. President Boris Yeltsin had to go, she declared, along 
with the gang of thieves who had stolen her pension, and the West 
had to stop meddling, and it was time for people to get down to real 
work. The woman was among some 10,000 marchers who turned out for 
the main event of the Nov. 7 commemoration, a march organized by the 
Russian Communist Party from the statue of Lenin on October Square 
through the center of Moscow to the old KGB headquarters. By most 
accounts, the turnout was better than in recent years, evidently reflecting 
the impact of the latest economic crisis, which hit in August. In 
the Soviet days, Nov. 7 was marked with a military parade past Lenin's 
Mausoleum in Red Square with huge banners proclaiming Soviet achievement 
and might. This time, a special edition of Pravda _ or at least one 
of two competing papers using the name of the official organ of the 
Communist party _ did issue a list of ``basic slogans,'' but instead 
of the long lists of the past there were only seven, including one 
that read, ``Rid the mass media of the henchmen of the West.'' But 
several years ago, Yeltsin issued a decree renaming the holiday the 
``Day of National Reconciliation and Agreement.'' And to keep the 
Communists from rallying at Lenin's tomb, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov sealed 
off Red Square with thousands of police, backed by thousands more 
in riot gear. Even the backup meeting place of the past, the Manezh 
Square, was now a glittering park and underground mall, so the marchers 
were relegated to the square facing the KGB building _ now used by 
its successor, the Federal Security Service. If there was a theme 
to the day, it was anger, dismay and confusion. Slogans, chants and 
placards were a melange of nostalgia and grievance, in which ``Power 
to the Soviets'' was just another cry of rage, along with the banners 
demanding the ouster of Yeltsin, the imprisonment of his ``team,'' 
the return of power to the ``working man.'' Scattered among the more 
mundane protesters were groups carrying ultranationalist or anti-Semitic 
banners, which have become more pronounced as the economy has worsened. 
``Yeltsin surrendered Russia to be robbed by Zion,'' read one placard, 
while youths dressed all in black proclaimed themselves the ``Black 
Hundreds,'' a name for ultranationists in czarist times. By agreement 
with the main Communist party, most of the more rabid Communist groups 
were shunted off to Vasilievsky Hill, where several hundred followers 
of radical organizations with names like the National Bolshevik Party 
or Working Russia vented their fury. One speaker roused approving 
guffaws when he declared that even if Yeltsin died and were buried 
in Russia, he would dig up the body and throw to the West, ``where 
it belongs.'' The day's most curious event was outside the Russian 
government building, where several dozen monarchists gathered to pray 
for those killed by the Bolsheviks in 1917 and to demand freedom for 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, who was arrested 
in London. ``He freed the Chilean people of that international garbage, 
the Communists,'' explained a speaker, who then expressed sympathy 
for the people marching under Communist banners elsewhere in Moscow, 
who were ``led on the same road to the abyss, first by Communism and 
then by the liberalism of the West.'' Behind the seemingly contradictory 
mix of Communism, internationalism, Russian nationalism and religion 
at the various points, the unifying strand was the shared invocation 
of an idyllic past that never was, whether czarist Russia or Lenin's 
Soviet Union, and a frustration with a present from which these protesters 
had been excluded. According to a public opinion poll by the Russian 
Independent Institute for Social and National Issues, only 13 percent 
of Russians still hold to Communist ideology, and 77 percent of these 
are poor. But the poll also found that 40 percent of those questioned 
still believe that the Communists can return to power. In a message 
issued from his rest home in southern Russia, however, Yeltsin suggested 
that even if they do return, they would hardly be the same Communists. 
In their official platforms, he noted, ``They are not only promising 
a `bright future' and social equality, but also democracy, and private 
property, and free enterprise, and a financial market. And not a wordk 
about the old values _ the war on religion, the hegemony of the proletariat, 
world revolution.'' In addition to the thousands of irate old Communists 
marching through Moscow's center, many more millions were out in playgrounds 
and streets enjoying a day off, including several hundred Muscovites 
who queued up for an hour or more to view a new exhibit, ``Cezanne 
and the Russian Avant-Garde,'' at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts.
