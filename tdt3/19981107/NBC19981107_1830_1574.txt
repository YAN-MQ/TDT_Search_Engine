All day long this past Tuesday, all across the country, one by one 
they filed in, marked their ballots, pulled their levers and slowly 
across the country, by nightfall, the voters had spoken. "Newsweek" 
columnist and NBC news contributor Jonathan alter on the signal they 
sent. Election '98, it's history now. Voting machines back into cold 
storage. This year marked the first time since fdr that the party 
controlling the White House actually gained ground in the House of 
Representatives. The unofficial warm-up to campaign 2000, with vice 
President Al Gore's message playing well. We say, "let's heal our 
nation. They say more investigation. Meanwhile, Texas governor George 
W. bush was reelected in a Landslide giving him a leg up in the republican 
presidential sweepstakes. From victories and defeats last Tuesday, 
lessons to file away for use next time. Duty and service -- Whether 
their styles are traditional, or a little more colorful. We shocked 
the world! All of this year's winners adopted at least some of the 
following campaign tactics -- the winners mostly drove right down 
the middle of the road. Conservatives sounding less conservative. 
Four years ago we made a promise to protect New York's environment. 
Liberals less liberal. When I wrote the law to put thousands of cops 
on the streets. The winners kept their eyes on the kitchen table, 
not the bedroom window. What mattered most to voters? Education, the 
economy, taxes, and social security -- not Monica Lewinsky. A final 
lesson -- and the winners turned out their core supporters even though 
overall turnout fell. Democrats reversed the old adage that low overall 
turnout favors republicans by getting their labor and black voters 
to the polls. Republicans did well again in races for governor by 
reaching out. Gracias, por vener. But in the house, it was a close 
shave, the republicans barely held their majority. A difference of 
9,500 votes spread out over six congressional districts would have 
shifted those seats to the democrats and given them control of the 
house. Now all the Bare-knuckle campaigning moves off the TV screens 
and all but disappears, unless you live in New Hampshire. We got a 
T here. This is important. Jonathan alter, NBC news.
