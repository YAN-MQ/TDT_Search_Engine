The federal communications commission soon will make a decision that 
could prompt other companies to charge per-minute rates for using 
the Internet. Some consumer groups say that could slow down web surfing 
and hurt businesses. Don Knapp reports. The Internet magazine "salon" 
gets 90% of its revenues from advertising. We place advertisements 
throughout the page. On the bottom this is one for Jaguar. And 98% 
of those who visit the "salon" web site arrive on regular telephone 
line, so what happens if people who dial up find they have to pay 
more to stay on line? There may be a slowing down, but I think there 
is so much momentum now to use the Internet, it would be almost impossible 
to try to take it away from people. But if getting online gets more 
expensive, people may surf less and focus more. And that may mean 
smaller audiences for web advertisers. I think people are much more 
likely to reduce the time they spend on the web and make sure they're 
really using their time valuably, instead of just randomly searching. 
If you have fewer people cruising the necessary, what happens to your 
business? Revenues go down. And also the revenues of the companies 
we work with go down, significantly. Internet access is cheap in the 
United States, compared to europe. The average Internet user spends 
between $200 and $300 a month for Internet access, at home. And people 
at work don't use the Internet like they do here in the U.S. 50 million 
of us now log on to the Internet. E-commerce generates hundreds of 
millions, if not billions of dollars. The FCC's decision could reverberate 
throughout the world wide web. I think it would be dangerous to kill 
the golden goose, if you will and kill this Internet economy. The 
FCC has indicated its decision doesn't necessarily mean minute-by-minute 
charges for web use. But it'll be a couple of weeks before we know 
for sure. Don Knapp, CNN, San Francisco.
