Honduras and Nicaragua may need more than a decade to recover from 
hurricane Mitch. That assessment comes from former President Jimmy 
Carter, who is in nicaragua. He's asking international lenders to 
forgive debts owed by the two countries hard hit by the hurricane. 
Emergency supplies are pouring into the region, but the aid is not 
getting to the people who need it. Devastated roads and limited air 
transportation are forcing many desperate survivors to wait for food 
and medicine. Hurricane Mitch is blamed for at least 10,000 deaths.
