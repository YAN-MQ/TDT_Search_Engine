A five-story apartment building collapsed Saturday in southern India's 
Maharashtra state, killing at least five people, injuring 11 others 
and trapping about 40, news agencies reported. Press Trust of India 
said fire department officials put the toll at 13 dead, but that police 
and hospital sources could confirm only five deaths in the collapse 
at Thane, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Bombay, India's largest 
city. United News of India news agency added that workers were clearing 
the debris and looking for survivors and bodies. The structure, with 
about 60 apartments, was put up without obtaining building licenses 
and was erected in a water drainage area in violation of building 
codes, Maharashtra Labor Minister Shabbir Sheikh told PTI. Such violations 
are common in India, often resulting in fatal accidents.
