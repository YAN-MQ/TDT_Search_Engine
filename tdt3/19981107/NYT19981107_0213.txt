The Devils found themselves Saturday reveling in the new-found excitement 
of winning a scoring duel while wondering about their old calling 
card, defense. Perhaps Bobby Holik, the Devils' talented center, said 
it best: ``We got a great win, but we didn't play a great game.'' 
The Devils made up for several defensive lapses by defeating the Florida 
Panthers, 4-3, at National Car Rental Center. Asked about his team's 
season-high offensive production, Devils Coach Robbie Ftorek shrugged 
and said, ``It would have been nice if they didn't get the three against.'' 
The Devils' victory, their fourth straight and their second over Florida 
in a week, raised their record to 7-4. Moreover, they are now 4-1 
on the road with a game at Tampa Bay on Sunday. Left wing Jay Pandolfo 
provided the clincher at 10 minutes 49 seconds of the third period. 
With his back to the net, he accepted a pass from Brian Rolston, made 
a sudden half-turn right from eight feet out and beat goalie Sean 
Burke in the net's left corner. ``Brian was going to shoot it, but 
then he saw me and kind of took a shot-pass and I just tipped it,'' 
Pandolfo said. ``A redirection like that, the goalie doesn't know 
where the puck is going to go. It was a great pass by Rollie.'' Even 
defenseman Ken Daneyko scored Saturday. It was his first goal since 
last Feb. 20. ``We're more offensive under Robbie,'' he said. ``We're 
starting to believe we can win these 4-3 games as well as the 2-1's.'' 
The visitors also received a controversial goal from wing Dave Andreychuk. 
Petr Sykora's shot had been batted in the air and sailed toward Andreychuk, 
who guided it to the ice with his hand and slammed a 2-foot shot by 
Burke. According to a league rule, a player is not allowed to fold 
his fingers on the puck. Andreychuk admitted there was no way he could 
grab the puck from over his head and not clutch it with his hand. 
Yet there was no review. Asked whether he violated the rule, Andreychuk 
said sheepishly: ``Probably yes, I guess. They should have called 
it.'' He discussed the situation with the referee Bill McCreary afterward. 
``He said it was close, but because I wasn't skating or wasn't going 
by anybody, he decided not to call it,'' Andreychuk said. Besides 
the call that the referee did not make, Andreychuk admitted to some 
luck in registering his fifth goal of the season. ``It's a quick play 
and I don't know where the goalie is,'' he said. ``It's a lucky play.'' 
The Devils had opened the scoring on right wing Randy McKay's 15-footer 
just 6:09 into the game, following a perfect pass from Holik. Amid 
all this euphoria about scoring, the Devils allowed a season-high 
13 shots in the first period, made neutral-zone mistakes that drew 
the ire of Ftorek and in general played worse than the coach would 
have liked. ``We felt we did a very good job at times,'' Ftorek said. 
``Then we did some things that were out of the territory of our game 
plan, and we had some problems. In the defensive zone, we didn't attack 
like we're supposed to and we ran around instead of staying in position.'' 
Added goalie Martin Brodeur, talking about defense: ``This is not 
the type of game we should be playing. If it is, it's going to be 
a long year.'' Most of this game's scoring occurred in the first period, 
as if the teams took time to work out the kinks of an early-afternoon 
starting time.
