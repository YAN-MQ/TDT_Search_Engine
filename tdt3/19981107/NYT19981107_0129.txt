Tommy Flowers, a British civil servant with a genius for electronics 
whose pioneering Colossus computers enabled the Allies to decode top-level 
German military communications in World War II, died Oct. 28 at his 
home in London. He was 92. The Colossus machines were once described 
by Flowers as a ``string-and-sealing-wax affair.'' But they became 
the capstone of the intelligence operation known as Ultra, which outwitted 
the Germans and, in the words of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, ``saved 
thousands of British and American lives.'' Soon after Britain went 
to war with Germany in the summer of 1939, many of its leading mathematicians, 
cryptographers and technicians were assembled at Bletchley Park, a 
Victorian-era estate 55 miles north of London. It was there that the 
German military codes were broken. Flowers was named a Member of the 
British Empire, receiving a 1,000-pound award for the decoding of 
military messages from the German Enigma machines in the war's early 
years. But his major contribution came in 1944 and 1945, when the 
computers he designed tackled the codes produced by the more sophisticated 
German Lorenz machines. The deciphering of those messages, between 
Hitler's headquarters and his generals, gave the British and Americans 
insight into German defenses for the D-Day invasion and subsequent 
battles. Thomas Harold Flowers was born on Dec. 22, 1905, in London, 
where his father installed bakery machines. Early on, he showed a 
penchant for engineering. As his son Kenneth related, ``When he was 
age 5 he was told he'd just gotten a baby sister. He said, `I'd rather 
have a No. 5 Meccano,''' a construction kit. Flowers obtained a degree 
in engineering from the University of London and in the late 1930s 
experimented with electronic telephone transmissions for the research 
arm of the British Post Office, which oversaw the nation's communications. 
He was enlisted in the Bletchley Park effort in 1942, although he 
later developed his computer at the Post Office's Dollis Hill research 
station in London. The British deduced the principals behind the Lorenz 
codes, but had been frustrated in developing technology for quick 
decoding. The machine the British were using in 1943 was slow and 
unreliable, and sometimes caught fire. Over a period of nine months, 
working with several senior engineering aides and a few dozen technicians, 
Flowers developed the first large electronic-valve computer, overcoming 
the skepticism of Bletchley Park officials. Colossus measured 16 feet 
by 7 feet, weighed one ton and was put together partly with standard 
telephone-exchange parts, the ``string and sealing wax.'' Although 
primitive by today's standards, it quickly pinpointed the wheel settings 
used by the Germans' Lorenz machine operators for coded messages, 
an essential first step in deciphering. Another device then completed 
the decoding. ``As soon as they delivered the machine to Bletchley 
Park in December 1943, it was a sensation,'' said Professor Brian 
Randell of the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, an authority on 
the program. ``It was an incredibly revolutionary idea.'' Decades 
later, Flowers wrote how ``at the time I had no thought or knowledge 
of computers in the modern sense and had never heard the term used 
except to describe somebody who did calculations on a desk machine.'' 
Churchill's government wanted 10 Colossus devices delivered by early 
June 1944, for the D-Day invasion. At least 10 machines were in operation 
by the war's end, but only one more Colossus could be produced in 
time for the Allied invasion of Normandy, on June 6. That machine 
was, however, five times as fast as the first Colossus, which started 
work the previous December. After the war, British authorities dismantled 
most of the Colossus machines. The very existence of Bletchley Park 
and the Colossus computers remained secret until the 1970s. Flowers 
returned to his electronics research for the Post Office and remained 
there until 1964. He then worked for a division of International Telephone 
and Telegraph, before retiring in 1969. In addition to his son Kenneth, 
of Beverley, England, he is survived by his wife, Eileen; another 
son, John, of London, and three grandchildren. Randell remembered 
how Flowers was ``very quiet and modest'' when finally allowed by 
British authorities to reveal his accomplishments. ``He had to come 
to terms with the fact that he was now being encouraged to talk about 
something that he'd been very actively discouraged from almost thinking 
about for 30 years,'' Randell observed. Although recognized by the 
scientific community, Flowers remained largely unknown to the British 
public. Yet his work lives on at Bletchley Park, which is now a tourist 
attraction. Run by a historic trust, it displays the Germans' Enigma 
and Lorenz machines. But the centerpiece is a replica of the Colossus 
computer, which was switched on by the Duke of Kent _ in the presence 
of Flowers _ on June 6, 1996, the 52nd anniversary of the D-Day invasion, 
which marked the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany.
