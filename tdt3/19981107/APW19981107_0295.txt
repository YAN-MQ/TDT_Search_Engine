Fifteen U.N. weapons inspectors, including missile experts, left Baghdad 
on Saturday in the first stage of the U.N. reduction of its teams 
in Iraq. The withdrawal comes a week after Iraq said it was halting 
all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the 
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range 
missiles. In response, UNSCOM said Friday it will withdraw 26 people 
from its staff of about 130. Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told 
reporters that Iraq's position on halting cooperation ``still stands.'' 
He was the first Cabinet minister to comment publicly since a Security 
Council resolution Thursday called the Iraqi position a ``flagrant 
violation'' of previous U.N. resolutions and urged Iraq to allow the 
UNSCOM inspectors to do their work. Iraq says inspections can resume 
only if the council gives a timetable for the lifting of U.N. sanctions 
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But sanctions can't 
be lifted until UNSCOM certifies Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction. 
Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the 15 experts leaving 
Saturday included four based in Baghdad and 11 who were on a special 
assignment. The 11 included some six members of a missile team. ``A 
visiting missile team ... just happened to be here when Iraq made 
its announcement,'' she said. ``The support staff is staying in place,'' 
Ms. Cross said. ``They have the qualifications to resume work immediately 
should Iraq have a change of heart.'' The experts left from an air 
base outside Baghdad on at flight to Bahrain, the spokeswoman said. 
More inspectors will leave Monday and Wednesday, she said. The standoff 
has raised fears of a military strike by the United States and Britain. 
On Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen returned from a tour 
of Arab nations and Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United States 
would have adequate support from Arab allies to carry out military 
action. But other members of the Security Council oppose military 
strikes. Russia's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that 
armed actions are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences for 
peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a whole.'' 
Besides UNSCOM, experts from the Vienna-headquartered International 
Atomic Energy Agency are also in Iraq, dealing with its compliance 
on nuclear issues. IAEA monitors have not been banned by Iraq. Cross 
said a nuclear team went into the field to continue monitoring work 
Saturday. No details were available. Meanwhile, Prakash Shah, the 
envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad, said the Security 
Council has asked Annan to help resolve the standoff. Annan signed 
an agreement with Iraq on Feb. 23 to end a previous crisis over inspections 
of presidential palaces.
