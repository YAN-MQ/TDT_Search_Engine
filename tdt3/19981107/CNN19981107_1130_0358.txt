Palestinian authorities reportedly have arrested several members of 
the militant group Jihad in connection with yesterday's suicide bombing 
in jerusalem. Two suspected bombers were killed and 21 Israelis injured 
when the device went off, apparently prematurely, at a crowded market. 
Following the explosion, Palestinian authority leader Yasser Arafat 
went on israeli TV and promised to do everything possible to capture 
and punish those who were responsible.
