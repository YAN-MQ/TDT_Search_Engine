Former President Jimmy Carter says Honduras and Nicaragua may need 
more than a decade to recover from hurricane Mitch. Carter is in Nicaragua, 
asking international lenders to forgive debts owed by the two countries 
hard-hit by the hurricane. Emergency supplies are pouring into the 
region, but the aid is not getting to the people who need it. Devastated 
roads and limited air transportation are forcing many desperate survivors 
to wait for food and medicine. Hurricane Mitch is blamed for about 
10,000 deaths.
