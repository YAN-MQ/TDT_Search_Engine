Prince Charles, angered by a claim that he wanted his mother to abdicate, 
has issued a strong denial and an unusually personal statement of 
his respect for her. ``The queen will always have my abiding admiration 
and affection and any suggestion that I wish Her Majesty to abdicate 
is utterly ludicrous,'' the heir to throne said in response to a press 
release about a TV documentary to be broadcast Sunday. Prince Charles, 
who is traveling in Bulgaria, responded Friday evening to the publicity 
for London Weekend Television's documentary marking his 50th birthday 
Nov. 14. The producers stood by their report and said it was based 
on briefings by a senior palace aide. The prince's statement, issued 
through Buckingham Palace and his own St. James's Palace office, said 
he telephoned the queen to say how distressed he was about the report. 
Members of the royal family rarely speak publicly about each other 
in such personal terms. They also rarely issue statements in the first 
person, preferring to have a spokesman make comments on their behalf. 
Prince Charles rejected the suggestion by LWT that he would be privately 
``delighted if the queen were to abdicate.'' ``The claims made in 
LWT's press notice are not only deeply offensive but completely wrong. 
They in no way reflect my views,'' he said. ``I begin to tire of needing 
to issue denials of false stories about all manner of thoughts which 
I am alleged to be having,'' he said. ``Some stories are so preposterous 
that they barely warrant a denial. However, others are both so outrageous 
and hurtful to my family, to the monarchy and to me personally, that 
they demand a response,'' his statement said. ``This country and the 
Commonwealth are served by an outstanding monarch. There is no one 
with a greater sense of duty and loyalty than the queen. She is an 
example to us all and I find these comments such as these abhorrent.'' 
``This is yet another example of people trying to create divisions 
in my family where they do not exist. It may successfully boost viewing 
figures but it is wrong.'' Two weeks ago Prince Charles and his longtime 
love Camilla Parker Bowles jointly stated that they were not involved 
``in any way'' in a new book that criticizes Princess Diana and purports 
to be based on interviews with his friends, family and aides. A spokeswoman 
for LWT said the producers of the documentary stood by the program 
and that it was based on four briefings with a senior palace aide. 
``We specifically asked for information on the Prince of Wales's thinking 
on the future of the monarchy. ... The key points in the briefing 
were reiterated at least twice and were checked again as recently 
as this week,'' the unidentified spokeswoman said.
