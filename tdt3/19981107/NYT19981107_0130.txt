That wispy but stubborn ideal ``world peace'' attempted a comeback 
here on the cold asphalt outside a college football stadium. About 
600 University of Virginia students camped out all night Sunday in 
the frigid fall air for a chance to snag the hottest ticket in town 
_ not for a rock concert or championship bowl game but for an academic 
conference featuring some of the world's most famous peacemakers. 
``I can't believe I just shook the Dalai Lama's hand!'' Jocelyn Diaz, 
a 21-year-old senior, shouted at the close of the two-day conference 
on Friday. ``I feel changed by this. You get so caught up with your 
life and then you see these people who are making so much of a difference.'' 
In a rare joint appearance, seven winners of the Nobel Peace Prize 
descended on the campus here and preached forgiveness and a shared 
responsibility for ending suffering around the world. By bringing 
together the Nobel laureates, the university hoped to inspire its 
politically apathetic student body and others into turning their attention 
away from material concerns for more than a moment to the world's 
victims of war, genocide, ethnic conflict and starvation. Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu of South Africa, who received the 1984 Nobel Prize for 
his work against apartheid, delivered a rousing speech to a standing-room 
only crowd in a university auditorium, pleading for help ``in realizing 
my dream, my dream of a world that is more caring, a world that is 
more compassionate, a world where people matter more than profits.'' 
Jody Williams, the American who shared the 1997 prize for her efforts 
to rid the world of its millions of land mines, urged students to 
get involved in causes and help change the things they abhor. ``Don't 
sit back and worry and don't sit back and cry and don't sit back and 
wait for the other guy to do it,'' Ms. Williams said. ``Join in and 
make it better yourself.'' The Dalai Lama of Tibet, the 1989 laureate, 
wearing a maroon monk's robe, exhorted students to look within and 
find their generous spirit. ``Caring about others,'' he said softly, 
``is a great benefit for the self.'' The three were joined by former 
President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica (1987), Jose Ramos-Horta 
of East Timor (1996), Rigoberta Menchu Tum of Guatemala (1992), Betty 
Williams of Northern Ireland (1976) and Bobby Muller, an American 
who represented the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which 
shared the 1997 prize. Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar (1991) sent a surrogate 
because she is prevented by her government from traveling freely. 
Professors said they thought the presence of the laureates at the 
university would inspire students and others to think about the world 
beyond the country's borders. ``Much less time is spent on international 
issues than 10 or 15 years ago,'' said Melvyn Leffler, a professor 
of history. ``With the end of the Cold War, our focus has changed.'' 
At Virginia, as at many of the nation's college campuses, activism 
peaked in the late 1960s and early '70s with protests against the 
war in Vietnam. The last major protests here were in the late 1980s, 
when students erected shanties on campus to denounce the university's 
investments in South Africa. These days, the atmosphere is different. 
``Students are so apathetic here,'' said Rebecca Daugherty, a junior. 
``They just go to class and drink and never stop to think about what's 
happening in other places.'' Many students clearly were moved by the 
Nobel laureates, though. ``Attending a single event can have a consciousness-raising 
effect,'' said Cristina Bull, a 19-year-old junior, who pledged to 
help Betty Williams campaign to get computers to poor schools in South 
Africa. ``It just reminds you that there are people who care so much 
about causes,'' she added. ``It makes you want to get involved.''
