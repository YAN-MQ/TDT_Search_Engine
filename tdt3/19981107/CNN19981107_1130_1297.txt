$5.12 million on the line in the breeder's cup classic today at Churchill 
downs. A star-studded field, pardon the pun. A third place finish 
or better for last year's champ skip away will make the five-year-old 
Gray the first $10 million winning thoroughbred ever. But besides 
the large purse, it's the long-awaited meeting between skip away and 
silver charm, last year's Kentucky derby and preakness winner. It's 
almost like the McGwire/Sosa matchup. So they get to prove it on the 
racetrack. So that's what the breeder's cup is all about. Matt Yallof, 
"CNN Headline Sports."
