15 United Nations weapons inspectors have left Iraq, saying they are 
no longer being allowed to do their jobs. Defense secretary William 
Cohen says the United States would have adequate support from Arab 
allies if the latest standoff over inspections leads to military action. 
Cohen has wrapped up an 11-nation tour of the mideast and Europe. 
The United States has been threatening military strikes against Iraq 
since that country ended its cooperation with weapons inspectors a 
week ago.
