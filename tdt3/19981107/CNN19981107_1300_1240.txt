Rob Ticktin, "CNN Headline Sports." We kick things off with college 
football where a total of five top-25 teams are already well under 
way. Michigan has won six straight. Audrey densen scores from a yard 
out for the fighting Irish. A Missouri win would give them back-to-back 
seven-win seasons for the first time since 1980. And the kbhander 
in chief's trophy is up for grabs. Later today, a big one in the acc 
as Florida state plays host to Virginia. Both teams with one conference 
loss, but needing to win to keep pace with georgia tech. 202 passes 
have been thrown without getting picks off. This game means a lot 
to us for the acc title. And I think, you know, Virginia is one of 
those team that is wants to win the acc and, you know, they feel like 
they've got the ability and the players to come in here and beat us. 
So we need to be prepared to play a good football team.
