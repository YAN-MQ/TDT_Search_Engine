Some live in nursing homes, as you might expect of men who are pushing 
100 years old, and few can walk without help. But Saturday, on the 
80th anniversary of the end of World War I, a dozen or so surviving 
British veterans gathered here at a museum devoted to the memory of 
war to receive one of France's highest distinctions and to hear, in 
the most ringing tones, that they have not been forgotten. ``On the 
11th of November, 1918, at 11 a.m., the sound of bugles echoed from 
trench to trench, ending a war that had scarred that generation forever,'' 
said Daniel Bernard, France's ambassador to Britain, as he affixed 
the Chevalier Cross of the Legion of Honor onto the chest of each 
veteran in turn. ``British veterans of the Great War, France wants 
you to know that she remembers, and from the bottom of her heart says, 
`Thank you.''' Two years ago, France presented the medal to all French 
veterans of the First World War. But Saturday, well aware that this 
is the last time any significant number of World War I veterans is 
likely to be alive on such a significant anniversary, the country 
searched out veterans from around the world. It found about 200 in 
Britain. Many were too infirm to come to the ceremony. Those who did 
attend had clearly made the greatest of efforts to be there. ``It 
was, of course, a world war, and hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers 
made the supreme sacrifice on French soil,'' Bernard said. ``It is 
absolutely right to honor Allied veterans in the same way as their 
French comrades.'' As they sat stiffly in the grand atrium of the 
British War Museum, with airplanes from past wars suspended over their 
heads and dozens of proud relatives surrounding them, the men found 
their minds going back to that terrible time many years ago, when 
they were young and in the process of being irrevocably changed. Albert 
Marshall, 101 years old, remembered how he was shot in his right hand 
and, after returning to Britain for treatment, re-enlisted and went 
back to France to fight again. Percy Lorriman, a week shy of his 100th 
birthday, said that as much as he tried to forget the horrors of war, 
the memory of his lost friends and relatives kept flooding back. And 
Ernest Argall, 99, who worked as one of the world's first wartime 
wireless operators, thrilled as he recalled the best message that 
ever came across his radio: the message that the armistice ending 
the war had been signed. ``I was lucky in that I didn't have to fight 
in the trenches,'' Argall said. ``But you can't forget it. I lost 
dozens of school friends, no end of friends. Their lives were chucked 
away, and I came away with the overall impression that lives didn't 
matter. I was really sickened by it, disgusted with the whole thing.'' 
Lorriman said he was delighted to accept the award, presented with 
a Gallic double-kiss on the cheeks by the ambassador, on behalf of 
all his fellow soldiers. ``I appreciate that the French have decided 
to honor all the lads _ not just me,'' he said. ``What would have 
happened to them without us, I don't know.'' Many of the veterans 
said they had always been reluctant to talk about their experiences, 
which took place at a time when men were not supposed to complain, 
discuss their problems or weep for the past. ``You lost someone nearly 
every day, but you just met trouble as it came,'' said Marshall, who 
served in the cavalry and machine gun divisions and today sat proudly 
in his wheelchair in a tweed suit, his chest heavy with medals. ``The 
shells and the bombs and the machine guns and what you will. It was 
difficult to come back and start a new life.'' Marshall's 67-year-old 
son, John, said his father had a first-rate memory but had always 
been reticent about the war. ``He's seen such horrible things, that's 
the problem,'' said John Marshall. ``We've learned more about his 
experiences in the last few weeks, as today approached, then we'd 
ever learned before.'' The ceremony came during a weekend of remembrance, 
in which Britain commemorates those who survived its wars, and those 
who did not. In a nation that has seen two generations effectively 
wiped out by this century's two great conflicts, war has always been 
a part of life. But after 50 years of peace, the memories are fading 
rapidly. ``It's unimaginable for our generation,'' said Caroline Kenyon, 
sitting in the audience during the ceremony. ``This is particularly 
relevant for me, because my grandfather was in the trenches for four 
years during the war, and he never recovered. He had the most terrible 
shell-shock, the most terrible nightmares.'' Brenda Barratt, whose 
uncle, Clarence Luscombe, 99, fought in the war by lying about his 
age when he volunteered, looked on with affection as Luscombe stood 
tall and said ``Merci'' when he received his medal. Next to her was 
her mother, Lily Ochiltree, Luscombe's sister-in-law, for whom the 
ceremony brought on a double set of emotions: Mrs. Ochiltree was 17 
when a bomb fell on her house in London during World War II, killing 
her parents and sister. ``I think they need remembering,'' Mrs. Barratt 
said of the veterans. ``In France, as the ambassador said, it's a 
duty to remember. I think that's true of all of us.''
