Stan Wright, the track coach who took the blame for the disqualification 
of two American sprinters who showed up late for their races in the 
1972 Munich Olympics, died on Friday night at St. Luke's Episcopal 
Hospital in Houston. He was 78. ``His kidneys just shut down,'' said 
his daughter Toni Hartfield. ``He had had dialysis treatments four 
times since he was in the hospital.'' He had been hospitalized since 
Sunday. Wright had been ill for many years. About 12 years ago, he 
had a heart-bypass operation, Hartfield said. His death came only 
two days after the death of his cousin, Larry Ellis, coach of the 
1984 U.S. Olympic men's track and field team and a former president 
of USA Track &AMP; Field. For a third of a century, starting at a 
time when black coaches were excluded from high positions in the American 
track hierarchy, Wright was a highly respected coach and administrator. 
In 1966, he became the first black head coach of a U.S. national track 
team when he was named to handle the U.S. team for dual meets against 
Poland and the Soviet Union a week apart in Los Angeles. His athletes 
on those teams included Jim Ryun, Al Oerter and Ralph Boston. In 1972, 
he was the assistant coach in charge of sprinters for the U.S. Olympic 
team. His three men in the 100-meter dash were Eddie Hart, Rey Robinson 
and Robert Taylor, all potential medalists. In the first morning of 
the Olympics, they easily won their first-round heats and qualified 
for the quarterfinals later in the day. Wright's time schedule indicated 
they would not run again before 7 p.m. At 4:17 p.m., relaxing in the 
Olympic Village, they saw on television what appeared to be a replay 
of their morning races. When they realized it was really the quarterfinals, 
they rushed to the track, but Hart and Robinson arrived after their 
races had been run. Taylor got there less than a minute before his 
race, stretched twice and finished second, advancing to the semifinals. 
The next day, Valery Borzov of the Soviet Union won the gold medal 
and Taylor the silver. On the last day of track, Hart anchored the 
United States to the gold medal in the 4x100-meter relay, but the 
onus of the disqualification would not go away. In an interview with 
Wright, Howard Cosell of ABC television assailed the coach. Months 
later, Wright accused Cosell of ``an unfair and inaccurate portrayal 
of my part in the incident.'' ``In the interview,'' Wright said, ``I 
took the responsibility, but not as an admission of incompetence or 
negligence on my part. I took the responsibility to get the athletes 
off the hook because it wasn't their responsibility and they didn't 
act irresponsibly.'' Wright said he learned after the fact that the 
schedules team officials had given to him and the other American coaches 
a month before the Olympics were outdated. After the morning races, 
he said he had shown the schedule to German officials in the check-in 
area and asked if it was still correct. He said they told him it was. 
Although little was said about it publicly, athletes from other nations 
missed races in three other events because of time changes they were 
not told about. Hart, the Olympic favorite, felt Wright was a scapegoat. 
``As an athlete,'' Hart said, ``you don't even want to think about 
such things as schedules. It is perfect for someone else to handle 
this part of the situation. I don't think there was anything wrong 
or bad about the way Stan Wright handled us.'' In addition to Ms. 
Hartfield, Wright is survived by two children, Sandra Robinson and 
Tyran Wright; two sisters, Charlotte Eddings and Mary Whitehead; five 
grandchildren, and one great grandson. Wright's wife, Hazel, died 
in October 1997. Stanley Van Dorne Wright was a round-faced, soft-spoken 
man who seldom hid his feelings. He was born Aug. 1, 1921, in Englewood, 
N.J., and starred there in high school baseball and basketball. He 
received a bachelor's degree from Springfield College and a master's 
from Columbia. He was the head track coach at Texas Southern University 
(1950-67), Western Illinois (1967-69) and Sacramento State (1969-79). 
He was also the athletic director at Fairleigh Dickinson (1979-85). 
He was chairman of the men's track and field committee of the Amateur 
Athletic Union and its successor as the sport's national governing 
body, The Athletics Congress. In 1993, he was elected to the National 
Track and Field Hall of Fame. At the behest of the State Department, 
he coached the Singapore track team in the 1962 Asian Games and Malaysia 
in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. In 1968, he was assistant coach in charge 
of sprinters for the U.S. Olympic team, and there was controversy 
there, too, when Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two of his sprinters, 
gave a Black Power salute during a medals ceremony and bowed their 
heads during the playing of ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' ``I was 
shocked and upset,'' Wright said then. But he also understood their 
protest of racial inequities in the United States. ``I would never 
tell anyone to do this or that,'' Wright said. ``They are men, not 
babies, admittedly young men, and if they want to raise a clenched 
fist or raise hell or whatever and they are willing to take the consequences, 
that is their business.''
