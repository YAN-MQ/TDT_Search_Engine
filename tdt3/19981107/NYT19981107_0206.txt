Nick Martucci and Brian Wolovich, Lehigh's defensive ends, did not 
believe that Ryan Vena, Colgate's heralded quarterback, could walk 
on water. They chased him and chased him Saturday, and caught him 
often enough to contain the Red Raiders' high-octane offense in a 
stunning 41-22 victory for the Mountain Hawks before a crowd of 13,432 
at Goodman Stadium. It was the pivotal game in the Patriot League 
this season, one that probably decided the championship and the conference's 
automatic bid to the Division I-AA playoffs. Lehigh (9-0) continued 
unbeaten, matching its best record since 1950, and it is alone in 
first place with two games remaining, against Bucknell (5-4, 2-2 in 
the Patriot League) and Lafayette (3-6, 3-1). ``It sure felt good 
after last year,'' said Wolovich, who had two of the four sacks of 
Vena. Last year Colgate beat Lehigh, 61-28, on the way to the Patriot 
League title. Saturday's loss snapped a streak of nine straight league 
victories for the Red Raiders (6-3, 3-1). Vena was held to 161 yards 
passing and 43 yards rushing; he was averaging 319 yards a game in 
total offense, second in Division I-AA, and his team was averaging 
37.5 points. Colgate was favored, in part because it had played some 
stronger opponents. Lehigh had 471 total yards and 29 first downs 
to 280 and 16 for Colgate. Lehigh's offensive standout was receiver 
Deron Braswell, who caught two touchdown passes and threw one, too, 
on a play that fooled the Colgate secondary. The two he caught were 
good for 46 and 26 yards, and they came from Phil Stambaugh, the latest 
in a long line of outstanding Lehigh quarterbacks. Stambaugh completed 
26 of 40 passes for 273 yards and three touchdowns. But his third 
and seventh attempts were intercepted, resulting in touchdowns for 
Colgate, which led by 14-0 after nine minutes of play. Stambaugh was 
intercepted three times in all, but two came on deflections. One was 
returned 70 yards for a score by Jesse Boyd, the Colgate free safety. 
``After a start like that, something good had to happen,'' Stambaugh 
said. Much happened. Lehigh scored 35 unanswered points in the second 
and third periods. Six came when Stambaugh threw the ball out wide 
to Braswell, who in turn threw it 30 yards down the field to a wide-open 
Kody Fedorcha. Trailing by 35-22 early in the fourth quarter, Vena 
took the Red Raiders to the Lehigh 4-yard line. There, on fourth down, 
Martucci and some teammates pursued Vena close to the sideline, where 
the harried Colgate quarterback let go a wild incomplete pass into 
the end zone. Lehigh then marched 96 yards for its final, convincing 
touchdown, on Stambaugh's fourth-down, 26-yard pass to Braswell. Stopping 
Vena at the 4 was the game's key play, according to both coaches, 
Lehigh's Kevin Higgins and Dick Biddle of Colgate. ``If we score there, 
we're behind by only six points,'' Biddle said. ``We didn't make the 
play. They made the big plays. We got beat because they outplayed 
us.''
