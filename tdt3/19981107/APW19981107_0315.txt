The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions on Saturday called for its one 
million members to strike one day a week until the Zimbabwe government 
cancels a 67 percent fuel price hike. ``We have agreed to embark on 
a mass stay away every Wednesday until these issues are ironed out,'' 
said Morgan Tsvangirai, secretary general of the trade union group. 
The decision was made by the group's national council. A strike by 
private taxis and buses against the price hike kept most workers from 
reaching their work places on Wednesday in the capital of Zimbabwe, 
as the former Rhodesia is now known. Some workers were on the job 
later in the week as heavily armed government troops kept watch in 
outlying townships to prevent protests. Defense Minister Moven Mahachi 
said the army is preventing anarchy. Tsvangirai charged that President 
Robert Mugabe had violated an agreement made in September that the 
government would consult with unions and employers before instituting 
major economic changes, such as the fuel price hike. ``We cannot trust 
people who violate the very next day agreements they have entered 
into. That is a very serious betrayal,'' Tsvangirai said. Worsening 
economic hardships and civil unrest are seen as the biggest threat 
to Mugabe, who recently committed 6,000 troops to backing the Congolese 
government in a civil war.
