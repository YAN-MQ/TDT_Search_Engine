Battered by international sanctions that have put Pakistan on the 
brink of economic collapse, government officials welcomed the good 
news Saturday that Washington had decision to lift some restrictions. 
U.S. President Bill Clinton wrote Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif to tell him, according to a foreign ministry statement issued 
in the Pakistani capital. The government is hoping this will be a 
''harbinger of the elimination of all sanctions, which Pakistan has 
consistently maintained are unjustified and counterproductive,'' the 
ministry statement said. In his letter, Clinton assured Sharif that 
the U.S. administration would ''exercise its influence with the international 
financial institutions to meet Pakistan's economic difficulties,'' 
the statement said. This is good news for Pakistan, which is in the 
midst of troubled talks with the International Monetary Fund for a 
dlrs 5 billion bailout package, without which Islamabad will surely 
default on its dlrs 32 billion debt. Sanctions imposed on both Pakistan 
and India following underground nuclear tests in May hit this poor 
nation of 140 million particularly hard because of its heavy dependence 
on international borrowing. Neighboring India, which had foreign reserves 
in excess of dlrs 25 billion, was better able to weather the storm. 
Less dependent on international aid, the Indian economy has not been 
hit as hard, but Indian foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh called 
the reported U.S. step ``positive.'' In a statement released late 
Saturday, the Indian foreign ministry said all sanctions should go, 
particularly those affecting international lending agencies. The ministry, 
reflecting longstanding complaints from New Delhi that the United 
States favors Pakistan, noted with some bitterness that according 
to reports from Washington, the United States was lifting sanctions 
in large part to prevent economic collapse in Pakistan. ``India has 
nothing against economic assistance to Pakistan,'' the statement said. 
``The remarks attributed to U.S. officials, however, reveal a selective 
and discriminatory approach which we find hard to understand and reconcile.''
