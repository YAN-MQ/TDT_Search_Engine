An unidentified gunman Saturday fired at the car of a judge who has 
gained the ire of Muslim extremist groups by sentencing many militants 
to death, police said. The judge escaped unhurt. Ahmed Salaheddin 
Baddour, the head of the Supreme State Security Court, was driving 
out of the northern city of Alexandria toward the capital Cairo when 
a single shot slammed into his car, police said. Two armed body guards 
in the car returned fire in all directions but were unable to locate 
the sniper, said police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
They refused to give details. Baddour has been dubbed the ``death 
judge'' by the opposition media for handing harsh sentences on militants. 
He has received death threats in the past and lawyers representing 
the militants have often asked for his removal. More than 1,200 people 
have died since 1992 in a militant insurgency against the state aimed 
at installing a strict Islamic state. Eighty-one militants have been 
sentenced to death by various courts.
