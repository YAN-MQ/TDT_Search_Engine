There's a new spirit wafting through the land. Hey, baby, we're talking 
about love power. The voters have chosen the lovers over the haters. 
The meanies with the jangly names _ Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Lauch 
Faircloth, Fob James, ``B-1'' Bob Dornan _ are toast. So are the guys 
like Al D'Amato, who sneered and jeered and used ethnic and anatomical 
epithets. So are the Christian zealots. And obsessive special prosecutors. 
The Democratic lover boys, like Bill Clinton, and the Republican preachers 
of compassion, like the Bush boys, are being embraced. Jesse ``the 
Body'' Ventura may have been a body-slamming, pile-driving bad boy 
in the ring, but the big lug just seems so darn huggable when he says 
he will continue to be a volunteer high school football coach even 
after he starts work at the Minnesota statehouse. And you've got to 
figure a governor in a fringed jacket is not going to do anything 
too Draconian. The moral of the Gingrich fall is this: When politicians 
behave like wrestlers, caricature villains who are only out to destroy 
their opponents, then the voters might as well get the real thing. 
Even if Ventura makes a mess in Minnesota, he can't possibly rival 
the mess the GOP House leadership has made in Washington. On Friday, 
as he slipped the first shiv into the speaker's back, Bob Livingston 
tried to drape his palace coup in lacy doilies: ``I love him dearly. 
He's my friend.'' He sounded more like Rosie than Brutus. He called 
``his dear friend'' Newt ``a man of Churchillian proportions.'' Even 
at the moment he was threatening Gingrich, the bland Livingston did 
not seem very threatening. Steve Largent, the boyish Hall-of-Fame 
football player from Oklahoma who wants to topple Armey, said the 
Republicans had to recapture that twinkling, leading-man magic of 
Ronald Reagan. Far from throwing bombs and raving about impeachment, 
Largent promoted himself for the job of House majority leader by saying 
he shares a house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood with two Democratic 
congressmen. Unlike the nasty Armey, who ``slipped'' and called Barney 
Frank ``Barney Fag,'' Largent claimed he actually liked working with 
liberals and moderates _ and had met with Barney Frank, Gerry Studds 
and David Bonior in an effort to ``build the relationship and the 
bridge.'' Newt Gingrich and Ken Starr made a monumental mistake. They 
were not merely content with punishing the president for having an 
affair in the Oval Office with an intern. They wanted to kill off 
the lax moral spirit of the '60s and stomp on what Gingrich in 1994 
disdainfully called the ``Great Society, counterculture McGovernik'' 
legacy. Both men thought they could banish situational ethics and 
restore '50s black-and-white morality. But gray is the fashion this 
fall. While baby boomers are more conservative, sexually and politically, 
and more materialistic than they once were, they don't want to go 
back to McGuffey Readers and twin beds. And a lot of them remember 
the '60s fondly. Moderation is mod. The extremes are extremely out. 
The message of the election was more kisses and hugs, fewer vendettas 
and wired-up girlfriends. More terms of endearment, fewer articles 
of impeachment. The capital is in shock this weekend. It's hard to 
believe that we are already in the post-Newt era. With a brief statement 
issued on Friday night, the history professor was history. At the 
White House there is already galloping Newt nostalgia. The day after 
the election, West Wing strategists were salivating over the prospect 
of running Al Gore against Newt Gingrich and Ken Starr, no matter 
who won the GOP nomination. With the speaker dumped and Starr's feet 
sticking out from under the house like the Wicked Witch of the East 
after the tornado, Democrats may have gotten too much of what they 
wished for. Clinton has so far been blessed with the overreaching 
of his enemies. The spotlight will now shift away from the president's 
enemies to the president himself. It's a mad, mad world. Who would 
have ever thought that the man Monica would bring down would be Newt?
