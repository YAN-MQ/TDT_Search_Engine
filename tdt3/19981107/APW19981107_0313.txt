For the first time since the trial of ousted deputy prime minister 
Anwar Ibrahim began last week, Malaysians held an anti-government 
demonstration Saturday. A few hundred people gathered in the rain 
outside a mosque in central Kuala Lumpur, shouting slogans against 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. There were few policemen at the scene 
and no violence was reported. A small peaceful protest was held in 
the same area, called Kampong Baru, last Saturday. Wearing badges 
saying ``Justice for Anwar,'' supporters screamed ``Mahathir Resign'' 
and ``Reformasi,'' the Malay word for reforms. Passing cars honked 
in solidarity and some motorcycle riders let go their handlebars to 
hold aloft Anwar's portraits which were being handed out. Activists 
also made a bonfire of a pro-Mahathir banner that was taken down from 
a nearby street and burned copies of a pro-government Malay-language 
newspaper. On Oct. 24, the country's first violent protest in almost 
three decades broke out at the same site. Police fired tear gas shells 
and water cannons to disperse stone-pelting activists. Saturday's 
demonstration in Kampong Baru was the first one since Anwar's trial 
began in the High Court on Monday. Anwar faces 10 counts of corruption 
and illegal sex acts. Street protests erupted in Malaysia after Anwar 
was fired from his post and then arrested on Sept. 20. Demonstrators 
have demanded Mahathir's ouster and justice for Anwar. Hundreds of 
people had been detained during recent downtown rallies demanding 
justice for Anwar. Police have warned they will come down hard on 
participants in the banned protests.
