To central America tonight, where the death toll from hurricane Mitch 
tops 10,000 with a similar number missing. NBC's George Lewis reports 
on the relief effort in Nicaragua. The relief effort to help central 
America intensified this weekend. Supplies pouring in from around 
the world. But there's a problem getting the supplies to the places 
where they're needed. Roads are washed out and bridges are cut in 
the areas hit hardest by hurricane Mitch. And there simply aren't 
enough planes and helicopters to airlift the relief goods to the towns 
and villages that have been left isolated, cut off from the outside 
world. At the foot of the casita volcano, partially collapsed by the 
heavy rains -- The killing fields of Nicaragua. This desolate, mud-covered 
landscape once was the village of rolando rodriguez. Out of 2,000 
inhabitants, only 40 survived. The dead are buried beneath the mud 
and the government has declared this place a national cemetery. Some 
of the villagers worked on a coffee plantation owned by ariel teran 
and his father. The rain doesn't stop, and we don't want another catastrophe 
on the farm. Teran, a U.S.-educated engineer, knows that the ground 
in these hills is unstable, that more deadly mudslides could come 
at any time. One of the mudslide survives went on a 5-mail hike to 
find food for her family. People in the next village gave people in 
the next village gave her three eggs and a few tablespoons of cooking 
oil. There are six people in isabel's family -- six people and only 
three eggs. And there are many thousands of isabels starving tonight 
in central america. George Lewis, NBC news, managua, Nicaragua.
