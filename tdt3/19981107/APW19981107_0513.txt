Staying on course to retain his coveted No. 1 spot at year's end, 
Pete Sampras was in convincing form Saturday, beating fellow American 
Todd Martin 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) to reach the final of the dlrs 2.55 million 
Paris Open. The top-seeded American closed out the second-set tiebreaker 
with an ace, then skipped and pumped his fist in the air, clearly 
relieved to reach the final after a back injury earlier in the week 
threatened his chances. Sampras, the defending champion, will face 
Britain's hard-serving Greg Rusedski in Sunday's final. Rusedski beat 
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in a tough, seesaw match 
that had the crowd stomping their feet. Sampras has beaten Rusedski 
all six times they've played. Both Americans were in top form on Saturday, 
and Sampras recognized it. ``Today's tennis was just about as good 
as it gets,'' he said. After hurting his back Thursday during a match 
against France's Jerome Golmard, Sampras showed no sign of injury 
Saturday, slamming 11 aces and volleying with ease. ``It's amazing, 
the ups and downs I've gone through the last few days,'' he said. 
``My back felt just about as good as it could feel today.'' But Martin 
was not an easy opponent, hitting 13 aces himself and matching Sampras' 
power from all parts of the court. In the first set, the players held 
serve until 5-4, when Sampras broke Martin to take the set. In the 
second set, it was more of the same, with Martin saving a break point 
for 3-3 and then four break points in the exciting eighth game to 
even the set at 4-4. The players battled to 6-6, then played a hard-fought 
tiebreaker. Sampras screamed with relief when he got the mini-break 
at 6-4, but Martin answered right back with an ace for 6-5. Sampras 
closed out the match with an ace of his own. Sampras is looking to 
end the season as No. 1 for a sixth consecutive year, and that quest 
will take him to Hanover for the ATP World Championships, where he 
will be competing for the top spot against Chile's Marcelo Rios. But 
first, he plays next week in Stockholm _ all in an attempt to gain 
as many points as possible in his quest to stay No. 1. ``I need goals,'' 
Sampras said. ``I need something to work for.'' Martin, ranked No. 
26, had a great tournament in Paris, beating both Patrick Rafter and 
Andre Agassi on the way to his matchup with Sampras. ``It was thrilling,'' 
he said Saturday. ``I've had a great week.'' But he was still frustrated 
at the loss to Sampras. ``A player like me doesn't get an opportunity 
like this too often, and its disappointing that I couldn't make better 
of it,'' he said. Rusedski, whose game is based on his huge serve, 
raced to a 5-2 lead in the first set, and looked as if he was going 
to make short work of the sometimes erratic Kafelnikov, a former French 
Open champion. But Kafelnikov came back to win the second set 6-4. 
The most dramatic point of the match came in the third set at 4-3, 
Rusedski serving, when a Kafelnikov shot was called out. He argued 
bitterly and the crowd agreed, becoming so boisterous that for several 
moments Rusedski couldn't continue serving. But the Briton held on 
to go up 5-3, then closed out the match two games later. ``It's worked 
very well for me this week,'' he said later, addressing the Parisian 
crowd in French. ``Of course it will be a very tough match against 
Pete, I've never beaten him. But if the public supports me, maybe 
I can do it.''
