Amid doubts about rebel intentions, a government troop pullout went 
into effect Saturday in this and four other war-wracked southern towns 
where peace talks are set to begin by December. The concession by 
President Andres Pastrana, removing 2,000 soldiers and police from 
a region of foothills and savannahs the size of Switzerland, is the 
boldest ever in efforts to end a 34-year civil war. ``We're creating 
stage where there is no armed conflict,'' presidential peace envoy 
Victor G. Ricardo said in a ceremony in San Vicente on Saturday where 
children danced, a choral group sang and white doves were released 
into a steamy breeze. ``Our forces have been moved out, but the authority 
of the state remains,'' Ricardo said. The troops were redeployed along 
the perimeter of the 16,200-square-mile (42,000-square-kilometers) 
pullout zone. The region is a stronghold of the 15,000-member Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia, of FARC, who have been fighting since the 
1960s and hold the battlefield advantage over a dispirited military. 
With the soldiers gone, the rebels _ who already rule the surrounding 
countryside _ are expected to waltz into town centers across the demilitarized 
zone. The process is moving forward despite growing doubts _ fueled 
by recent rebel attacks_ about the guerrillas willingness to make 
peace. A week ago, the FARC overran a remote state capital in southeastern 
Colombia, raining homemade missiles on an outmanned police barracks 
and killing at least 57 people. The FARC may just be flexing muscle, 
hoping to strengthen its hand in the talks, ``but that's the most 
benign hypothesis, and there aren't many who agree with it,'' said 
former foreign minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo. Perhaps as a goodwill 
gesture, rebels on Saturday freed the mayor of Milan, a town 78 miles 
(125 kilometers) southwest of San Vicente, held since April to protest 
elections. At a Friday news conference, Ricardo said the pullout would 
not disrupt everyday life. The national cattlemans' association said, 
however, that rebels have already expropriated 8,000 steers from the 
area. Courts were closed and shifted to nearby towns, although banks, 
schools and hospitals and transportation would function normally, 
Ricardo said. Civilians are to be deputized as temporary police, but 
they will not carry arms. ``So far there's an apparent calm,'' said 
49-year San Vicente car wash owner Urbano Silva Rojas. ``We hope it 
continues that way.'' Ricardo said ... picks up 14th grf pvs
