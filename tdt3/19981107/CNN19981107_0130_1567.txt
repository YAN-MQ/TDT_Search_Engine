An art show in Washington is presenting a rare opportunity to see 
dozens of paintings by Vincent Van gogh. Gina London reports, art 
lovers are clamoring to get in. It's not an unusual sight for die-hard 
fans to brave the elements and line up for hours to get tickets to 
an event like a rock concert. I think I got up around 4:30. We had 
to pack a blanket, went the night before and bought a thermos. But 
this round-the-block queue is not for some musician, but for a long 
dead artist from Amsterdam named Vincent Van gogh. There's been an 
overwhelming demand, wonderful interest from people all over the country. 
The 72 paintings on exhibit here range from his landscapes outside 
Paris, to his bedroom at arles, painted just two years before his 
suicide, making this the largest collection of his life's work, outside 
amsterdam in more than 25 years. While the color and style of his 
paintings are bright and exciting, the national gallery notes the 
allure of Van gogh, the man, is also a big draw. The tragic romantic 
life that he had. The genius neglected in his own time, that he only 
sold one painting in his life and now they fetch huge sums of money. 
Critics may now agree on the importance of his work, but not everyone 
agrees on the pronunciation of his name. We say Van gogh. In Holland, 
they say Van gog. In France, they say Van gock. In England, they say 
Van gohh. And in Japan they say goho. However you say Van gogh, thousands 
of people every day are lining up to see his art. In Washington, Gina 
London, "CNN Headline News."
