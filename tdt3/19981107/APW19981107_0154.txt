Mobs have lynched eight people suspected of taking part in the murders 
of dozens of Muslim clerics and others accused of dabbling in black 
magic, official and news reports said Saturday. Police said three 
men were beaten to death Saturday by vigilantes in Pemalang, 350 kilometers 
(218 miles) east of Jakarta. The attackers allegedly believed the 
three were the mysterious serial killers. Two others, who managed 
to escape, were under police protection. Two villagers were arrested 
on suspicion of carrying out the attacks but were later released for 
``security reasons'' after a mob of hundreds, sympathetic to the alleged 
murderers, protested the arrests, said Lt. Col. Suyadi, chief of the 
local military. The mob gathered after the two other suspected serial 
killers escaped from the vigilantes, said a police officer. He added 
that the mob attacked a police station before being dispersed. Police 
fired warning shots and tear gas to disperse the protesters. ``Fortunately, 
I and (Islamic) preachers were able to persuade the mob, saying lootings 
and burnings are prohibited by Islamic teachings,'' said Suyadi. ``We 
told them that lootings and burning were prohibited in Islam.'' The 
killings brought to eight the number dead in revenge attacks by vigilantes 
in the province since Thursday. In other revenge attacks, vigilantes 
killed five people in three separate locations in Central Java, reported 
The Jakarta Post newspaper. Two men and one woman killed in the attacks 
were mentally ill, the report said. ``This has gone too far,'' said 
Col. Monang Manulang, police chief of Jepara district, 400 kilometers 
(250 miles) east of Jakarta, where two of the victims were killed. 
``People do need to secure their villages, but killing mentally ill 
people? Residents should not take the law into their own hands,'' 
he said. Vigilantes have taken to the streets on the main island of 
Java after the murders of more than 150 Muslim clerics. Fear prevails 
in many small towns, where mobs have lynched people suspected of carrying 
out the murders. In many areas, mentally ill people have become scapegoats. 
Muslim leaders have warned that they will deploy their own civilian 
security forces if the military is unable to restore order. News reports 
said the Central Java police have rounded up some 200 mentally ill 
and homeless people to prevent them from being lynched by mobs.
