An Iberia jet took off from Spain on Saturday to bring tons of medicine, 
food, water and other supplies to thousands of Central America's victims 
of Hurricane Mitch. In all, about 55 tons of supplies donated by the 
Spanish branch of the Red Cross were shipped to Managua. The Boeing 
747, the national airline's biggest plane, also carried members of 
Spanish humanitarian groups. ``There is a lack of everything there 
and a long task to rehabilitate the region,'' Leopoldo Gomez, secretary-general 
of Spain's Red Cross, said at Madrid's Barajas airport. The Spanish 
government approved 1.89 billion pesetas (dlrs 13.4 million) in emergency 
aid Friday to the four countries affected by the hurricane: Honduras, 
Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador, and it temporarily suspended 
the deportation of illegal immigrants from these countries. In less 
than a week, Spain's humanitarian groups have collected 4.5 billion 
pesetas (dlrs 31 million) for Central America. Hurricane Mitch has 
killed thousands and caused widespread damage in what were already 
some of the world's poorest countries. Scores more are missing and 
tens of thousands were left homeless.
