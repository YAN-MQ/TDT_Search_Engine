Spain's Carlos Sainz is in sight of the world championship following 
a blunder by rival and title holder Tommi Makinen in Rally Australia 
on Saturday. Makinen, seeking a third world title, made a costly mistake 
in the 2.2-kilometer (1.36-mile) 19th stage at Langley Park. The Finn, 
driving a Mitsubishi, was penalized 1 minute for jumping the start 
in the short stage and he tumbled from second to sixth, 1 minute, 
22 seconds behind Sainz. Sainz, driving a Toyota, took over the lead 
in an eventful day of racing. With only the RAC Rally in Britain to 
go, Sainz can wrap up the championship Sunday if he wins and Makinen 
finishes worse than fifth. Sainz went to the front when leader Richard 
Burns of England rolled his Mitsubishi in the 14th stage and lost 
his 1 minute, 20 second lead over the field. He managed to continue 
as he limped to the service park, but lost more time with a damaged 
turbocharger. Sainz inherited the lead from Burns as Frenchman Didier 
Auriol held down second spot in another Toyota. Makinen had to battle 
back after a penalty for a late service exit on Friday and had climbed 
into second before his mishap in the final stage Saturday. At the 
end of racing, Sainz held a strong 35.4-second lead over Auriol with 
Burns in third, Juha Kankkunen fourth and Colin McRae fifth.
