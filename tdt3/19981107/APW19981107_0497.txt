A Bulgarian parachutist was killed when his parachute failed to open 
properly at an international tournament, officials said Saturday. 
The dead man was part of a five-member display team attempting at 
synchronized night-time jump from 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) on to 
Locarno airfield late Friday. His main parachute failed to open properly 
and his reserve parachute got caught up, organizers said. He landed 
on a car and died of his injuries. The three day ``Day and Night'' 
international jumping event in southern Switzerland was scrapped as 
a result of the tragedy. The man was not identified.
