The question has unleashed a stream of constitutional experts, acid-tongued 
opinion makers and endless chatter from television pundits. What constitutes 
an ``impeachable offense?'' Now, after months of Democratic demands 
for a workable definition and calls to hold an in-depth debate, 19 
historians, professors of constitutional law and former Justice Department 
officials, including an attorney general, are expected to gather on 
Monday on Capitol Hill to offer their own interpretations and help 
Congress formulate an answer to the elusive question. They will testify 
before the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the constitution, 
chaired by Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. Ten of them will be Republican 
witnesses; eight Democratic. And, in a rare gesture of comity, one 
professor, Michael Gerhardt, who teaches law at the College of William 
and Mary in Virginia and who wrote a recent book on federal impeachment, 
will speak as a joint witness. But some Democrats on the committee 
are skeptical about Monday's hearing, saying that what is truly needed 
is a debate between members and some sort of threshold agreement on 
whether the evidence sent by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, 
rises to the level of impeachment. ``I believe we are omitting the 
essential task before us, which is to compare the allegations to the 
historical standards of other high crimes and misdemeanors,'' said 
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who served on the Democratic staff of 
the Judiciary Committee during Watergate. ``If we were to do that, 
there is a substantial possibility we may not need further proceedings. 
``We are now going to have 19 witnesses on one day, on a subcommittee. 
It's really a shoddy approach.'' The list of witnesses includes constitutional 
law experts, like William Van Alstyne, a professor at Duke University, 
and Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor; historians like Arthur 
Schlesinger and Jack Rakove, who won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for his 
book on the constitution; Griffin Bell, an attorney general under 
President Carter; and Gary McDowell, now the director of the Institute 
for U.S. Studies at the University of London and a well-known Reagan 
champion. Each witness will make a 10-minute presentation and then 
answer questions from members. The panel was put together with political 
considerations in mind. The Republican witnesses will argue, for the 
most part, that the framers of the Constitution would have considered 
perjury a ``high crime and misdemeanor,'' a position held by many 
Republican committee members. ``If the framers were the ones examining 
this, they would have impeached and removed the president,'' said 
Stephen Presser, a professor at Northwestern University's law school. 
``If what Starr says is true, and that's a big if, the president has 
turned the engines and law-enforcement mechanisms of government to 
his own advantage. If he has tried to frustrate the working of law, 
he has done everything the framers feared an unscrupulous official 
would do.'' Experts summoned by Democrats will argue that impeachment 
is an act of last resort, reserved only for flagrant acts that imperil 
the nation's public interest. On Friday, five of the eight Democratic 
panelists signed a letter, along with 395 other legal scholars, to 
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who later that day announced he was stepping 
down as speaker, and to the leaders of the Judiciary Committee, stating 
that Starr's accusations do not warrant impeachment under the Constitution. 
Two historians signed a similar letter. ``If certain crimes such as 
murder warrant removal of a president from office because of their 
unspeakable heinousness, the offenses alleged in the independent counsel's 
report or the investigative counsel's statement are not among them,'' 
the letter stated. ``Short of heinous criminality, impeachment demands 
convincing evidence of grossly derelict exercise of official authority.'' 
Rakove, who will testify Monday, said: ``There is a good reason for 
us to think or ask why we have only had two previous impeachment proceedings, 
all of them very different in their circumstances.'' Several panelists 
wondered whether their testimony would even be relevant in the coming 
weeks, believing as some of them do that the Democratic victory in 
last week's elections made impeachment increasingly unlikely. ``They 
are looking for an exit strategy,'' said the Rev. Robert Drinan, a 
Georgetown University law professor and former member of Congress 
who sat on the Judiciary Committee during the Watergate hearings. 
But Presser said he disagreed with that view. ``As I read the Constitution, 
Congress has no choice in this matter,'' he said. ``If the president 
has committed an impeachable offense, Congress has the duty to remove 
him. It's not Congress may. It's Congress shall. ``You are either 
impeachable or you are not. It doesn't shift with the duty of public 
opinion.''
