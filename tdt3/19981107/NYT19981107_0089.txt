Madison Hut, pinned just below the raw summits of Mount Adams and 
Mount Madison in the Presidential Range in New Hampshire, is a sublime 
place to be on a sunny day. The views there above the tree line, at 
an altitude of 4,825 feet, go around the compass and are stirring 
_ while man and his handiwork remain out of mind. Therefore, it was 
startling on a recent afternoon to hear a telephone conversation amid 
a small gathering scattered outside the hut. A white-haired woman 
was speaking into her white cellular telephone. ``Guess where I am?'' 
she said. A stranger beside me on the hut's stoop, reading a paperback, 
turned. Our eyes met, our eyebrows lifted. Had we not expended three 
hours climbing over rocks and roots to reach this enchanted spot and 
thus to escape the telephone? The stranger soon became a friend. He 
turned out to be Norman Sims, chairman of the journalism department 
at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and a member of the board 
of directors of the Appalachian Mountain Club, the latter the proprietor 
of Madison Hut since 1888. We happened to agree on any number of subjects 
beginning with the inappropriate possession and use of portable telephones, 
or any such electronic gadgets, in the woods _ or whatever may constitute 
wilderness in the late 20th century. We are hardly alone. But are 
we members of a majority soon to be a minority? More cellular phones 
are being stuffed into backpacks than ever before, one suspects. Outfitters 
like the Eastern Mountain Sports stores report that Global Positioning 
Systems, the relatively new navigational tools, are selling briskly. 
Beepers are becoming as common as trail mix. On a hike in the Adirondacks 
last summer a doctor in our party of purists had a beeper hooked to 
his belt. We looked at it suspiciously. OK to take a call from a patient, 
we admonished, but not from his wife asking what time he would be 
home for dinner. The issue is cloudy. Electronic communications can 
certainly be termed safety devices if they help in saving lives, if 
they quicken or eliminate rescue operations, and expose fewer people 
to dangers. But there is no way to limit, monitor or even define their 
use. ``If we don't take a stand,'' I told Sims, ``someday too soon 
there will be boom boxes up here.'' The technology is not yet perfected, 
thank goodness. The cellular telephones do not always work because 
of areas restricted by topography, as the organizers of the 1993 world 
orienteering championships found out. They had to install wire phone 
lines at considerable expense to their competition finish lines in 
Harriman State Park which is only 30 miles from New York City. Peter 
Fish, the renowned Forest Ranger of the High Peaks in the Adirondacks 
who has climbed Mount Marcy 499 times, says phones cannot reach out 
so well from all the places so their safety use is limited. ``You 
can call out from summits,'' he said in a recent interview. ``But 
problems don't happen on top. Problems happen down in the valleys 
on the way to and from the top, in which case the phone may or may 
not function. ``The only answer to that is to have your fittest member 
run all the way to the top to call for help.'' Fish, who this year 
at age 62 has begun a well-earned retirement, is ambivalent about 
the issue of safety or despoilment. But he is, he said, ``less than 
enthralled'' with the Global Positioning Systems. These hand-held 
instruments, that cost from $100 to $300, can position locations by 
reading signals from satellites and thus affix longitude and latitude 
numbers within about 300 feet. They are powered by four AA batteries. 
``If the power source fails,'' said Fish, ``and someone has put all 
their trust in them, they are really up the creek because they haven't 
a clue where they are.'' These systems are remarkable in that they 
will track a hiker's route from his automobile at the trail head into 
the woods and back out again with a line and arrows on a small screen. 
But they complement rather than replace traditional compass and map. 
A story I heard in both the Adirondacks and in the White Mountains 
this past summer is about a lost hiker who called for help on his 
cellular telephone. His GPS would no longer work, he said. The replying 
ranger said, ``Well, let's figure out where you are. Get out your 
map.'' ``What map?'' said the hiker. ``I don't have one.''
