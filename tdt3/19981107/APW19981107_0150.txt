After a tumultuous homecoming visit, LPGA rookie star Se Ri Pak left 
for the United States on Saturday to prepare for the Tour Championship 
tournament. The 21-year-old South Korean returned home to a hero's 
welcome on Oct. 27. But Pak came down with a flu and exhaustion and 
was hospitalized for four days after she was besieged by the media 
and an unending round of promotional events for her corporate sponsor 
Samsung. Pak was forced to skip this weekend's Japan Classic golf 
tournament. Instead she has rested at her parents' home in Seoul since 
Wednesday and spent time together with friends ``shopping and gossiping.'' 
``While in hospital bed, I thought much about what it is like to be 
a public figure,'' Pak told journalists before boarding a plane bound 
for Los Angles. ``My condition is not perfect but is fairly good. 
I will go into the last LPGA tournament with no big expectations, 
but I will do my best,'' she added. The Tour Championship is the last 
LPGA event of this year. Pak has only a slim chance of beating Annika 
Sorenstam in the Player of the Year points race. A victory at the 
Tour Championship is worth 60 points and Pak is about 40 points behind 
Sorenstam. On Friday, Pak received South Korea's second highest sports 
medal from President Kim Dae-jung. Pak rose to fame after winning 
four LPGA tournaments, including the U.S. Women's Open and the LPGA 
Championship, in the best LPGA rookie year since Nancy Lopez debuted 
in 1978.
