An Italian man confessed on-camera to killing his entire family in 
1989, calmly telling interviewers that ``it was an act of complete 
madness.'' In an interview broadcast on state TV Monday night, Ferdinando 
Carretta, 36, said he shot his father, mother and brother to death 
at the family apartment in the northern city of Parma. The family 
_ including Ferdinando _ vanished, apparently while on a camping trip. 
Their fate was one of Italy's most enduring mysteries until now. Ferdinando 
surfaced by accident in London when police stopped him on a routine 
traffic violation. A computer check showed he was listed as a missing 
person and Italian authorities were notified. On Sunday, he returned 
to Italy and was arrested at the airport on a warrant for triple homicide. 
Shortly afterward, he confessed to police. ``He couldn't wait to confess,'' 
an investigating magistrate, Vittorio Zanichelli, told the Italian 
news agency ANSA. It was not his first confession, as things turned 
out. A few days before his return, Carretta was interviewed in London 
by an Italian TV program about missing persons. The show's director 
accompanied him back to Italy. Parts of the interview were aired on 
the news Monday night. ``I shot my parents and my brother,'' he said. 
``It was an act of madness, an act of complete madness.'' ANSA said 
Carretta told his interviewers that he hated his father and killed 
his mother and brother because they were witnesses to his father's 
slaying. Carretta told, 12th graf pvs
