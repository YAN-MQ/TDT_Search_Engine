Some Arsenal fans are starting to lose patience with French manager 
Arsene Wenger. Wenger, criticized for his lack of big-name signings 
in the off-season, suggested after Sunday's 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough 
that fans were spoiled by last year's league and F.A. Cup double. 
``Perhaps we gave the fans too much last season,'' he said. ``If you 
eat caviar every day, sometimes it is difficult to come back to sausages 
and mash.'' That didn't go down well Monday with fans angry over the 
club's exit last week from the European Champions League and its fourth-place 
position in the Premier League, four points behind Aston Villa. ``It 
is an insult and it shows he doesn't understand the relationship between 
a manager and the fans,'' said Ian McPherson of the Independent Arsenal 
Supporters' Association. ``Even if he thinks that, he should never 
say it in public. He should be saying Arsenal fans deserve the best 
and we are trying to give it to them.'' ``People want some decent 
signings, not third-rate French kids,'' he added. McPherson said Arsenal 
should have bought Dion Dublin, who moved recently from Coventry to 
Aston Villa. ``The fans have been behind him (Wenger) because he won 
the double, but now they are beginning to wonder about some of the 
second-rate buys he has made _ there are a whole bunch of them at 
the club.'' French striker Nicolas Anelka, who replaced the popular 
Ian Wright up front after Wright moved to West Ham, has failed to 
win the Gunners fans' complete support. ``Wenger keeps going on about 
how great Nicolas Anelka is going to be in three years, but we want 
to see something now,'' McPherson said.
