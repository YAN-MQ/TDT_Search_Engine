A young bull got loose in Melbourne, Australia, today and went on 
a Three-hour rampage. The bull's endless energy and nimble footwork 
kept animal control officers and police officers on their toes for 
hours. The chase came to an end when they managed to steer the bull 
into a nearby practice field for cricket. They used a truck to block 
the bull's last route of escape.
