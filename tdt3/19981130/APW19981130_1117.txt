An ultralight aircraft crashed into trees near southeastern Humacao 
in Puerto Rico, injuring the pilot and one passenger, police reported 
Monday. The Quicksilver MXL III was flying over the Palmas del Mar 
resort at about 6 p.m. Sunday when the aircraft's engine failed, pilot 
Mike Stoughton told police. Stoughton landed the airplane but hit 
a line of trees in the Harvard View area of the resort, police reported. 
His collarbone was broken and his female passenger suffered cuts on 
her neck. Both were hospitalized and were in stable condition Monday.
