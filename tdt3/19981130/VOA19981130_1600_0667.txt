The alleged leader of a Russian organized crime group has gone on 
trial in Geneva amid unprecedented security. Lisa Shline reports Swiss 
authorities are increasingly concerned by what they consider to be 
the growing influence of Russian criminals in Switzerland. The Russian 
man, Sergei Mikhailov, is charged with being a member of a Moscow-based 
criminal organization and of breaking Swiss property laws. If convicted, 
he could face 7-1/2 years in prison. When. Mr. Mikhailov was arrested 
at Geneva's airport two years ago, he was accused of money laundering, 
but that charge was subsequently dropped because Swiss investigators 
found it impossible to gather evidence in Russia. Mr. Mikhailov has 
spent the past two years in Geneva's Chantalone prison from where 
Swiss officials say he has been running his organization's criminal 
activities. Mr. Mikhailov denies all charges and says he is just an 
ordinary businessman. The trial is supposed to last two weeks, but 
if the defendant's lawyers have their way, it will go on for a lot 
longer. Mr. Mikhailov arrived at the courthouse in a bullet proof 
limousine. He looked relaxed as his lawyers made the first of what 
is likely to be a series of procedural motions aimed at delaying the 
process. The lawyers asked the judge to postpone the trial on the 
grounds that their client's case was irrevocably damaged by bias media 
reporting and the unprecedented security measures. After a short adjournment, 
the judge denied the motion. As soon as the trial resumed, the defense 
attorneys lodged another appeal. They claim that the case against 
their client was invalid under European human rights law. This trial 
is seen as an important test case by Swiss authorities who fear the 
growing presence of Russian organized crime in the country. This is 
seen as the first major attempt by the Swiss to try to curb Russian 
criminal activities. More than 90 witnesses speaking six different 
languages are expected to be called to testify. They are under heavy 
police protection. In some cases, witnesses have been given bullet 
proof vests. One of the key witnesses will be a former Moscow police 
officer who has been granted political asylum in Switzerland. Lisa
