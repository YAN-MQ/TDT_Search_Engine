Royal Dutch/Shell Group announced Monday that it had broken off talks 
with Texaco about combining their refining and marketing businesses 
in Europe, because a joint venture would not produce the savings they 
had sought. The breakdown in that negotiation came as a source close 
to the merger talks between Exxon and Mobil said Monday that the two 
companies were still working to complete a deal that could be voted 
on by both boards and announced as early as Tuesday. Weakening oil 
prices, one of the forces driving many petroleum companies to combine 
operations, fell further Monday. The price of a barrel of oil for 
January delivery reached a 12-year low, falling 65 cents, or 5.4 percent, 
to $11.22. The decline in crude-oil prices had been expected after 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week took no 
action to extend the current level of cuts through 1999. In addition, 
warmer than normal weather in the United States has cut the demand 
for heating oil and natural gas. The step by Royal Dutch/Shell could 
slow the quick pace of realignment that has been reshaping the refining 
part of the oil business. It was quickened two years ago when British 
Petroleum and Mobil began to combine their refining and fuel sales 
in Europe, which they have said has led to savings of about $500 million 
a year. Paul Skinner, the president of Shell's European oil-products 
business, said that the company would continue to restructure its 
own refining in Europe. Shell is the largest refiner and seller of 
fuel in Europe, with close to 20 percent of the market. Texaco, which 
has about 3,800 gas stations in Europe, mostly in Britain, has about 
5 percent of the market. Skinner said the merging of Shell, Texaco 
and Saudi Aramco's refining and marketing in the West and Midwest 
of the United States, would continue. The prospect that crude-oil 
prices will remain low for a long time has put pressure on major oil 
companies such as Mobil and Exxon to find a fast way to cut costs 
and to cooperate on exploration, which has become very expensive. 
The two companies confirmed on Friday that they were engaged in merger 
talks, and although they cautioned that this might not lead to an 
agreement, sources close to the talks have said they were optimistic 
that a deal could be reached. If a merger is agreed on, it is expected 
to set off a scramble among other major oil companies to find partners.
