Closing arguments are under way today in the federal corruption trial 
of former agriculture secretary Mike Espy. He's charged with illegally 
accepting more than $35,000 worth of gifts from companies he was responsible 
for regulating, including some from chicken processing giant Tyson 
foods. Espy maintains he never did anything in return for the gifts, 
which included tickets to professional sporting events.
