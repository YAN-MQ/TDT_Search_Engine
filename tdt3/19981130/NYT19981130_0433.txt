The moment was right Monday for a crunch-time speech to the troops 
by Coach Bill Parcells. The Jets are tied for first place in the American 
Football Conference East with the Miami Dolphins at 8-4. Their first 
division title since 1969 is within their grasp. December is Bill 
Parcells' month. Still, a day after a 48-21 trouncing of the Carolina 
Panthers it was time to talk about paying attention to detail. ``Until 
you understand what makes you lose, you'll never understand how to 
win,'' Parcells is fond of saying. In his lexicon, not losing is winning. 
In the stretch run of four games in December (although he and every 
Jet know how miserable that month has been for all of the 1990s; the 
Jets have the National Football League's worst record this decade) 
Parcells said that he did talk about attention to detail and how the 
little things get magnified. ``The only thing I was talking to them 
about this morning was certain little things,'' Parcells said. ``As 
you see, some of these things that can become season-deciding events 
for teams, you see what seem like inconsequential plays affecting 
teams' seasons. You make the wrong mistake as an individual player 
at the wrong time, you send your team home, and that is when it is 
not all right.'' ``All right'' referred to a player being patted on 
the back after a mistake and being told, ``It's all right.'' The Oilers, 
he pointed out, were guilty of a roughing-the-passer penalty on the 
Seahawks' final drive Sunday. It allowed Seattle to kick the game-winning 
field goal. Those Seahawks (6-6) visit the Jets on Sunday. ``Basically, 
we've got 19 weeks of work in here, and it is coming down to the last 
27 days,'' Parcells said. ``For you, if you do the wrong thing at 
the wrong time, if you make a dumb play, you cost your team. It is 
not like Denver, or Minnesota _ they can afford to do that.'' Last 
season, the Jets were also 8-4, but wound up with a 9-7 record and 
missed the playoffs. That included a 1-2 record in December. Or it 
will be remembered that before Parcells took over in 1997, the Jets 
had lost 15 consecutive December games going back to 1993 under three 
different coaches _ Bruce Coslet, Pete Carroll, Rich Kotite. But none 
of those teams had the offensive firepower that can cut through the 
most miserable weather, or bail out an ineffective defense. And the 
offense is getting better. ``The offensive line came as close to a 
perfect game as any I've been in as long as I've ever played. I can 
say that by how I feel today. I never got touched, not even this much,'' 
said quarterback Vinny Testaverde, jabbing a finger lightly in a listener's 
biceps. ``The only thing that hit me all game was an elbow from Curtis 
Martin on a handoff. It got me as he turned for the ball.'' That was 
one of Martin's 21 carries that gained 110 yards on a day when everyone 
was blocking: the offensive line, the receivers, the running backs. 
Testaverde understands New York, however, and he knows the history 
of the Jets. He lived it as a child and as a fan. So Decembers past 
are fresh, but not necessarily significant any longer. ``It seems 
that at each stage of the season there's some past problem to look 
at, and yet we've overcome them,'' he said, reflecting on historical 
Jet difficulties. ``Last year there was our division record.'' It 
was 2-6. ``This year we've got a good division record,'' Testaverde 
said. It is 4-1. ``It's unfolding as well as anyone could have imagined 
it. The record doesn't stop here. It gets better.'' Certainly, the 
record of Parcells' teams in December is no fluke. In fact, his past 
teams' record in December is better than it is in September, October 
or November. Since Parcells became a head coach in 1983, his Giants, 
Patriots and Jets teams are .615 in December. Over that same span, 
the Jets are .235. Now, the Jets go into December facing a final four, 
each presenting an element of danger _ the Seahawks at Giants Stadium, 
at Miami and at Buffalo and then the regular-season finale at home 
against the Patriots. ``I think the players are looking forward to 
this,'' Parcells said. ``We've got a tough road. This isn't cruising 
here. If we get through these games, and win these games, we will 
have earned it.''
