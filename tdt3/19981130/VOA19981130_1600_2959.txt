Oh, the market stumbled badly today erasing all of last week's gains 
and then some. The Dow Jones closed 216 points down. That's a loss 
of 2.3 percent. Standard & Poor's was off 28 points, and NASDAQ lost 
66 points. That's down 3.3 percent, thanks mostly to the tumbling 
Internet stocks. Airlines, financials, and oil also dipped today. 
It was generally a broad sell off. Analysts don't seem especially 
concerned or alarmed. They believe that the market may have moved 
too far too fast, and it's over valued, over bought, maybe too large 
for its present time, and is simply pulling back. They say this could 
be a natural sort of phenomenon, the correction, and investors should 
stay put, don't panic. Anyway, the Dow Jones today went down 2.3 percent 
for a loss of 216 points. This is Elaine Johannsen. Thank you, Elaine.
