International Monetary Fund chief, Michelle Komdasu, flies to Moscow 
Tuesday for talks about the possible resumption of loans to Russia. 
VOA's Peter Heinline reports Russia's Cabinet postponed crucial budget 
talks on the eve of the visit. Mr. Komdasu is to hold talks with Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials about plans to tackle 
Russia's economic crisis. The IMF suspended a $22.6 billion loan package 
when the crisis hit in August. Fund officials say no further installments 
will be made until Russia adopts a realistic budget. Last Saturday, 
a clearly frustrated Mr. Primakov lashed out at what he called these 
young kids from the IMF dictating economic policy to Russia, but he 
admitted his government needs the fund's money to overcome its current 
financial turmoil. Mr. Primakov was to preside over a Cabinet meeting 
on budget matters Monday, but the session was postponed until after 
the Komdasu visit, a clear sign of the difficulty ministers are having 
in finding a way out of the worse economic crisis since independence.
