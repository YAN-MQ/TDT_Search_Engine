Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country's troops 
will stay in southern Lebanon until security guarantees are given. 
This, after two weeks of increasing fighting have seen mounting causalities. 
Walter Rodgers has more from Jerusalem. Across from the prime minister's 
office, a small but growing contingent, calling for a unilateral Israeli 
military withdrawal from south lebanon. I think a growing number of 
people in Israel are sick and tired of the bloodshed in Lebanon. We 
feel that the policy was a fair policy to begin with, and it's about 
time the government admitted it and brought our boys home. Prime minister 
Netanyahu approved limited air strikes against hezbollah guerrillas 
in Lebanon, retaliation for recent casualties. But he is under pressure 
from the United States not to escalate the war. Visiting the most 
recent casualties, Netanyahu signaled better protection for soldiers, 
not unilateral withdrawal, is his policy. I believe we can do more 
to change the circumstances on the ground in lebanon, so that our 
forces are less vulnerable. Israel occupies south Lebanon to keep 
Hezbollah guerrillas from attacking northern Israel. The guerrillas 
are trying to throw the Israelis out. Increasingly, even Israelis 
think this is a war they cannot win. Still, Israel's top security 
officials met Sunday and decided there will be no unilateral troop 
pullout. With Lebanon now on Israel's front burner, Palestinian issues 
now simmer on a back burner. But only temporarily. There have been 
more violent protests demanding Israel release more palestinian prisoners. 
Yasser Arafat is at the White House to enlist President Clinton's 
support on that issue. Against this backdrop, President Clinton arrives 
here in less than two weeks. Walter Rodgers, CNN, Jerusalem.
