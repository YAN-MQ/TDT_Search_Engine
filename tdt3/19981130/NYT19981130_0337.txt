Former Sen. George Mitchell, who was instrumental in arranging the 
Northern Ireland peace agreement in April, returned to the British 
province Monday to discuss the impasse that has stalled the peace 
effort. Officials and experts in Belfast, the northern capital, and 
Dublin, the capital of the Irish Republic, said Mitchell's discussions 
with Roman Catholic and Protestant leaders indicated that the Clinton 
administration was worried about the possible breakdown of the agreement. 
The accord has reached a standstill over several issues. They include 
disarming the Irish Republican Army and creating governmental structures 
that are to lead to more power for the northern Catholic minority 
and for the Catholic Irish Republic in the affairs of the predominantly 
Protestant British province of Ulster. On Sunday, Mitchell received 
two awards for his work as a peacemaker, then met at a hotel in Cork, 
south of Dublin, with Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland. Mitchell 
said he was on an ``entirely private'' visit and that although he 
was not officially representing the White House he would brief Samuel 
Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, or his assistant, 
Jim Steinberg, this week. ``I'm not surprised there are difficulties,'' 
Mitchell said in an interview. He added that he was ``encouraging 
all the people involved'' to end the impasse. ``It would be a huge 
tragedy if this were to fail because of inability to implement the 
agreement,'' he said. Mitchell, chairman of the talks until the agreement 
was reached on April 10, said he was not considering a formal return 
to the peace effort as a mediator. He is now a lawyer in the firm 
of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP; Hand in Washington. 
He talked with Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political 
wing of the IRA, and with the two leaders of the new Northern Ireland 
Assembly, which is to put the provisions of the peace accord into 
effect in 18 months. The two leaders, assembly First Minister David 
Trimble, a Protestant unionist, and his deputy, Seamus Mallon, a Catholic 
nationalist, are to visit Washington early in December and are expected 
to seek meetings with President Clinton. Mitchell also spoke with 
John Hume, head of the Catholic mainstream Democratic Labor Party, 
and David Ervine, head of the Progressive Unionist Party, which has 
ties to Protestant paramilitary groups. He did not talk with the Rev. 
Ian Paisley, head of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, which 
boycotted the peace talks. Paisley has attacked the agreement as treachery 
that will lead to the subsuming of the North into the Irish Republic. 
Adams said he had spoken to White House officials over the weekend, 
asking for their intervention. Adams and his party have been excluded 
from the new provisional government that is being formed in Belfast 
until the IRA agrees to start disarming. He pointed out that the April 
agreement stipulated only that disarmament occur by the spring of 
2000, when the agreement is to be fully enacted. Trimble insists that 
disarmament has to begin long before that. The IRA, which has held 
a cease-fire for 16 months, refuses to disarm until the peace agreement 
is fully enacted.
