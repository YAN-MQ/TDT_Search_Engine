Ian McEwan's new novel, ``Amsterdam,'' which won the Booker Prize 
in Britain this autumn, is a dark tour de force, a morality fable, 
disguised as a psychological thriller. A chilling little horror story, 
easily read in one enjoyable gulp, ``Amsterdam'' is by no means McEwan's 
finest work: It is less ambitious than ``Enduring Love'' (1998) and 
``Black Dogs'' (1992), and less resonant than ``The Innocent,'' his 
1990 masterpiece of Cold War suspense. One can only hope that this 
small, perfectly fashioned novel _ novella, really _ will send readers 
back to the rest of the talented McEwan's oeuvre. Like so many of 
the author's stories, ``Amsterdam'' concerns the sudden intrusion 
of violent, perverse events into his characters' mundane lives, events 
that cruelly expose the psychological fault lines running beneath 
the humdrum surface of their world. In ``The Comfort of Strangers,'' 
a pair of middle-class tourists fall prey to a Machiavellian sadist 
during a trip to Venice. In ``The Cement Garden,'' a group of children 
are orphaned and bury their mother in the basement. And in ``The Child 
in Time,'' a man's 3-year-old daughter is kidnapped during a trip 
to the supermarket. In the case of ``Amsterdam,'' two old friends 
_ one a famous composer named Clive, the other a mercenary newspaper 
editor named Vernon _ enter into a strange euthanasia pact that will 
determine both their fates and send shock waves through their privileged 
world. Now in their middle years, Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday 
have both achieved prosperity and influence. How lucky they were, 
Clive thinks, to have been ``nurtured in the postwar settlement with 
the state's own milk and juice, and then sustained by their parents' 
tentative, innocent prosperity, to come of age in full employment, 
new universities, bright paperback books, the Augustan age of rock 
and roll, affordable ideals.'' Clive, who regards himself as Vaughan 
Williams' heir, has been commissioned by the government to write a 
Millennial Symphony; in his more optimistic moments, he dares to think 
of himself as a genius, an artist worthy of comparison to Shakespeare. 
Vernon, who has become editor of a tabloid paper by default, is decidedly 
less confident: There are moments, alone in his office, when he wonders 
whether he even exists. All the exchanges in which ``he had decided, 
prioritized, delegated, chosen or offered an opinion'' made him feel 
he was ``infinitely diluted; he was simply the sum of all the people 
who had listened to him, and when he was alone, he was nothing at 
all.'' Back in their impoverished, bohemian youth, Clive and Vernon 
had been lovers of a ``restaurant critic, gorgeous wit and photographer'' 
named Molly, a daring, glamorous woman who also had an affair with 
Julian Garmony, a conservative, xenophobic politician who would go 
on to become Britain's foreign secretary. Molly would eventually marry 
a rich, stuffy publisher named George Lane, who detests (and is unanimously 
detested by) her former lovers. When a sudden illness leaves Molly 
delirious and incompetent, George seizes control of her life, forbidding 
her old friends to visit her sickbed. In the wake of her funeral, 
Clive and Vernon not only commiserate over her death but also make 
a pact with each other to avoid ever suffering such an undignified 
end: Should one of them become as sick and incoherent as Molly, the 
other will help him finish things off. Writing in his usual spare, 
evocative prose, McEwan deftly conjures up the glittering London world 
Clive and Vernon inhabit, and he also does a nimble job of depicting 
them at work, showing us how Vernon is trying to boost his paper's 
falling circulation with trendy, tasteless stories, how Clive is trying 
to create an ending for his symphony commensurate with his ambition 
to commemorate the millennium. Though there's a faint satiric edge 
to McEwan's portraits, he uses his psychological insight, as he's 
done so often before, to create sympathy for some decidedly unsavory 
people. Indeed, we find ourselves rooting for Clive and Vernon, even 
as it becomes clear that both of them _ much like James Penfield, 
the hero of ``The Ploughman's Lunch,'' a movie written by McEwan back 
in 1984 _ are conniving opportunists, willing to use virtually any 
means necessary to achieve their ends. Within days of each other, 
Clive and Vernon are both faced with moral dilemmas that will test 
just what sort of people they are. Clive must decide whether to put 
aside his beloved symphony to help a woman who may be in trouble, 
while Vernon must decide whether to publish some compromising photos 
of Julian Garmony that could end his political career. Their respective 
decisions will forever alter their careers, and imperil their decades-long 
friendship. For all the appeals to high-flown principles like art 
and freedom that Clive and Vernon make in coming to their decisions, 
their problems do not really open out into the sort of weighty philosophical 
debates that animated ``Black Dogs'' and ``Enduring Love.'' Nor, given 
the predictable outcome of the story, is there the sort of grisly 
narrative tension that made ``The Innocent'' so suspenseful to read. 
Instead, there are the simple pleasures of reading a writer in complete 
command of his craft, a writer who has managed to toss off this minor 
entertainment with such authority and aplomb that it has won him the 
recognition he has so long deserved. PUBLICATION NOTES: `AMSTERDAM'
