In floor florks, prosecutors charged the controversial church of scientology 
in the death of one of its members. The church pleaded not guilty 
to felony charges of practicing medicine without a license and abuse 
of a disabled adult. Here is ABC's Ron Claiborne. After being involved 
in a minor car accident, 36-year-old Lisa mcPherson began acting oddly, 
so she was taken to this hospital for psychiatric evaluation. A few 
hours later, eight fellow members of the church of scientology convinced 
doctors to release Lisa to their care. 17 days later, she was dead. 
Investigators say scientology members held Lisa against her will at 
this church-owned hotel, forcing her to undergo a regimen of herbs, 
vitamins and drugs to treat psychosis. Scientologists oppose conventional 
psychiatric treatment. Police say the day she died, scientologists 
took Lisa to this hospital 25 miles away, passing closer hospitals, 
because they knew a scientologist doctor who worked there. One investigator 
concluded -- An autopsy found that she was severely dehydrated and 
had lost 40 pounds. The cause of death was an embolism. Lisa, the 
last 17 days of her life, was put in the position to be treated in 
a certain manner according to their dogma, and that led to her death. 
The scientology church lawyer and officials declined to discuss today's 
not guilty plea, but a spokesperson for the church recently said they 
wanted to put this unfortunate incident behind them. Even if convicted 
of all charges, the maximum penalty would be a $15,000 fine. Ron Claiborne,
