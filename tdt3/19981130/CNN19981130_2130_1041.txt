Many business travelers can't afford to miss anything that goes on 
at the office. Kalin Thomas-Samuel looks at how hotels are accommodating 
them in our "Working ahead" report. Check in, and get plugged in. 
Hotels are giving you more tools to stay in touch. Hilton, sheraton 
and Hyatt have installed printers and fax machines in business-class 
rooms. Things that allow business professionals to work better in 
the rooms. In the swissotel cybercafe, guests attending seminars can 
surf the net or check E-mail during coffee breaks. Companies say Internet 
access can help boost productivity and attendance. It's very hard 
nowadays to get people to actually come out of their offices to attend 
a seminar when there is so much information available on the web. 
We skip across the hall. A computer is already set up for us, and 
we get a little bit of work done. Guests want online information, 
and concierge at swissotel have it at their fingertips. Baseball, 
pro football, college football, pro basketball, college basketball. 
We've ordered exotic animals for our guests. We've ordered exotic 
Flowers, we've even organized vacations for our guests. They really 
don't need to bring their laptop anymore. Coming soon at Hilton -- 
an electronic concierge in your room. You can order room service, 
you can order your on-screen movie. You can go into the virtual office 
and use productivity tools to word process or create a spreadsheet. 
You can go out to the virtual music store and listen to your favorite 
music. And if you liked it, you could buy it. On the horizon -- hotels 
offering wireless Internet access. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, Atlanta.
