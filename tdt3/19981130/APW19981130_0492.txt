A gay rights activist appeared in court Monday charged with ``indecent 
behavior in a church'' under a seldom-invoked law branded ``archaic 
and repressive'' by free-speech campaigners trying to get it repealed. 
Peter Tatchell, who heads the British gay rights group Outrage, was 
arrested under the 1860 Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act after 
he staged a three-minute protest beneath the pulpit as the Archbishop 
of Canterbury, Britain's top cleric, was about to deliver his Easter 
Sunday sermon April 12 at Canterbury Cathedral. He could face two 
months in jail for the interruption in which he criticized the archbishop's 
opposition to lowering the homosexual age of consent and the church 
ban on the ordination of gay clergy. He denies the charge of indecent 
behavior. ``A two month jail sentence is extraordinarily draconian 
and hugely harsh, given that you can assault people and get community 
service these days,'' said Keith Wood, general secretary of the National 
Secular Society, which is trying to get the law repealed. The law 
was last used in 1966 when two anti-war activists were arrested after 
protesting the Vietnam War in a Methodist church as then-Prime Minister 
Harold Wilson delivered a sermon. The protesters were jailed for two 
months in 1967 for the offense. ``This is an archaic remnant of church 
privilege designed to stifle dissent,'' Wood said. ``It clearly isn't 
needed, otherwise ti would have been used more frequently.'' Amnesty 
International has expressed concern that Tatchell will not have a 
fair trial because the courts have already refused him permission 
to call the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, as a witness at 
his two-day trial. ``Mr. Tatchell is not being prosecuted on account 
of any views that he may hold in regard to the matters that were the 
subject of his protests,'' prosecutor Montague told the court. ``It 
was inappropriate both as to time and place. It was unseemly. It was 
indecorous.'' Public figures such as playwright Harold Pinter called 
for the law to be abolished in a letter to The Times newspaper Monday, 
while other celebrities such as actor Ian McKellan and actress Vanessa 
Redgrave have also come to Tatchell's defense.
