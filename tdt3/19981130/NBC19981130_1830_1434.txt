I'll be right back with the story of a true hero, and the legacy he's 
left behind. The marvel of its aerodynamics. The sheer exhilaration 
of take-off. It's enough to make an aerospace engineer jealous. Chrysler 
Concorde. Ranked best premium midsize car in initial Qua lity by J.D. 
power and associates. Now lease a conc orde LX for $289 a month. Engineered 
to be great cars.
