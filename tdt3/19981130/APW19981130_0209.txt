At least seven shaven-headed monks were injured Monday when rival 
monks clashed anew in a leadership dispute in South Korea's largest 
Buddhist order. Hundreds of gray-robed monks, many of them wearing 
yellow helmets, exchanged punches and kicks as they tried to take 
control of Chogye Temple in central Seoul. It was the third violent 
clash at the temple since early this month, when dissident monks drove 
out mainstream rivals from the temple and took control of its administrative 
office. The latest clash occurred as an estimated 2,000 mainstream 
monks from throughout the country attempted to regain control of the 
temple, which has been occupied by dissident monks for three weeks. 
The temple grounds were strewn with smashed window panes, sticks, 
burned furniture and garbage. Police said the injured were hospitalized 
with minor head and other wounds. About 1,000 Buddhist followers, 
holding placards appealing for a peaceful solution, watched the battle 
as it continued for more than three hours until after nightfall. As 
a bulldozer moved into the temple grounds to clear piles of sticks, 
panels and other debris set up as barricades, hundreds of helmeted 
mainstream monks tried to move into the administrative building. About 
800 rival monks holed up inside the building repelled them by spraying 
fire extinguishers and water from hoses and hurling rocks and furniture, 
About 1,200 riot police stood by but did not intervene. Past police 
interventions in religious disputes have given the force a political 
black eye. The leadership dispute in Chogye, the largest Buddhist 
denomination in South Korea, erupted in November when Song Wol-ju 
announced his bid for a third four-year term. His opponents, including 
the order's spiritual leader, Wol Ha, 83, urged him to step down. 
A rule stating that the order's chief monk cannot serve more than 
two terms was enacted in 1994 in an attempt to prevent the office 
from wielding too much power. Song claims that the rule cannot be 
applied for his case, because he could not finish his first term in 
the early 1980s because of dispute with the then military government. 
Chogye, which emphasizes zen meditation, claims 8 million worshipers. 
South Korea has a population of 44 million.
