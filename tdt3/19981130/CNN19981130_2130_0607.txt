New Jersey has become the first state to get rid of car pool lanes 
without losing federal highway money. The action affects interstates 
80 and 287. A state study found hov lanes on those roads did not reduce 
congestion or increase the number of people who carpool. Environmentalists 
fear lifting the restrictions will increase pollution and traffic. 
Hov lanes will remain on the New Jersey turnpike.
