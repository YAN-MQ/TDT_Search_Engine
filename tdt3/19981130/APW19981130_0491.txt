Five days after one of the worst train accidents in India, officials 
were still trying to identify 10 bodies in a hospital mortuary in 
northern India. The bodies of all the other 201 victims have been 
claimed since Thursday's collision of the Sealdah Express and the 
Frontier Mail near Khanna town in the state of Punjab, railroad and 
police officials said Monday. ``It's very difficult to identify these 
disfigured bodies,'' said Dr. Manjit Singh, hospital superintendent 
of the Patiala Medical College, where the bodies have been kept. Authorities 
plan to either cremate the bodies later or use them for medical studies, 
he said. Officials have videotaped the bodies and the personal belongings 
found at the site of the accident, which occurred on a foggy morning 
when an express train plowed into derailed coaches of another train. 
State-run television has shown the videotapes repeatedly, hoping relatives 
and friends of the victims would help identify the bodies. Most people 
in India do not carry identification cards. Tickets of passengers 
traveling on unreserved coaches do not carry their names. On Monday, 
three families all claimed the body of a 21-year-old woman. Police 
settled the case in favor of one of them after a relative who had 
seen her off in Bombay identified the clothes. Police also scurried 
to stop a truck transporting the body of a woman after they realized 
that the claimants had misidentified her. Police realized that a body 
that had been claimed in the morning matched the description given 
by another frantic family, and radioed highway police to intercept 
the truck. The search ended on a happy note for two men who rushed 
to the mortuary when told that their brother _ for whom they had been 
searching for five days _ was among the dead. While going through 
the bodies, they got a phone call that their brother had returned 
home. He had been injured in the crash.
