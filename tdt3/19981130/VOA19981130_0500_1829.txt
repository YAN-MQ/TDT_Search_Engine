Israeli forces attack Hezbollah guerrilla positions in south Lebanon 
hitting suspected guerrilla targets, Sunday. Earlier, Hezbollah mortar 
shell Israeli positions along the entire front. Some Israeli cabinet 
ministers call for air strikes on power and water supply facilities 
for Beirut. Hezbollah says any Israeli attack on the city would bring 
the city a retaliation.
