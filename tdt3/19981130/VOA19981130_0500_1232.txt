Spanish Tennis Player Alex Carrachie fought back from a two set deficit 
to defeat countryman Carlos Moya at the ATP tour Championships in 
Hanover, Germany. John Meyers has details. This astonishing four hour 
fight set marathon could have been over in half the time, but for 
the most remarkable comeback from Alex Carrachie. He was trailing 
by two sets to love, with Moya showing the kind of form that has helped 
him brush aside Britain's Tim Henmon in the Semi-Finals. But then 
Carrachie rediscovered the resolve that saw him survive against all 
odds in his epic encounter with defending Champion Pete Sampras. He 
took the third set, 7-5 and the fourth, 6-3, before breaking Moya's 
serve in the 11th game of the decider and then holding his nerve and 
his serve to land the biggest win of his career. Alex Carrachie now 
clings to number three in the world's ranking and heads home to Barcelona 
with a check for 1,360,000 US dollars. In front of a capacity crowd 
of 13,000 people, Alex Carrachie has been crowned as the King of the 
ATP Tour World Championships, 1998. John Meyers for VOA Sports in 
Hanover, Germany.
