For every football player who limps or is carried off the field, there 
is a soccer player who gloats that soccer is the safer of the two 
sports. But a study published in the current issue of the British 
Journal of Sports Medicine reveals that the risk of injury in soccer 
may have been downplayed, at least at the professional level. Using 
videos from 171 domestic and international matches in Britain's professional 
soccer league, researchers at the Center for Hazard and Risk Management 
at Loughborough University found that players had a 12 percent risk 
of injury every game. More significantly, they reported that almost 
a third of professional players would suffer at least one injury this 
season. ``The injury rate, is about 1,000 times what you'd find in 
industry,'' said Dr. Colin Fuller, a lecturer of health and safety 
management at the center and director of the study. ``It works out 
to every employee having a reportable injury once every three weeks, 
which, of course, would be completely unacceptable.'' According to 
the Loughborough researchers, only a third of the injuries resulted 
from fouls. The rest involved legal contact between opposing players. 
Muscle strains were the most common injury, often resulting from improper 
warming up, Fuller said. Comparing soccer and football injuries is 
difficult. The National Football League does not keep track of injuries, 
although the NFL Players Association and Federal regulators are conducting 
a study to find ways to reduce the high number of concussions players 
suffer. Eight years ago researchers at Ball State University surveyed 
retired NFL players and discovered two out of every three players 
reported suffering serious injuries in their careers. These required 
surgery or caused them to miss a minimum of eight games. Especially 
at risk are the quarterbacks, who are generally smaller than the linemen 
they oppose. In the English soccer study, player position was of no 
consequence. ``Two percent of all (soccer) players end their careers 
prematurely because of injury,'' said Scott Drawer, who contributed 
to the study. ``And when there are 2,600 players in the English Leagues,'' 
he added, ``that is a lot.'' ``We didn't expect the injury risk to 
be this high,'' he said. ``But then some are playing 60 to 70 games 
a year.''
