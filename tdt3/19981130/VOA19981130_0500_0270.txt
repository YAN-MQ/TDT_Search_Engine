Italian and German legal experts meet today in Rome to discuss setting 
up an international court to try Turkish Kurd rebel leader Abdullah 
Urjullon for terrorism. Mr. Urjullon is under house arrest near Rome. 
One of his lawyers says Mr. Urjullon is willing to be tried by an 
international court that could decide if international law regarding 
war should apply in his case. Turkey considers Mr. Urjullon a terrorist, 
and supporters consider him a freedom fighter for Turkish Kurds seeking 
self-rule.
