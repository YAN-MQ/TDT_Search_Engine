Just ahead, providing care and covering up for Russia's rulers on 
PRI. This week on "This American Life," for the holidays it is our 
annual poultry slam, stories of turkeys, chickens, dugs, fowl of all 
kind and their mysterious hold of our imaginations. Last year, we 
brought you an opera about Chicken Little. This year, it is the story 
of a bird that's only eaten with a napkin over your head and how a 
roomful of chickens made one man realize he was not a socialist. That's 
this week on "This American Life" from Public Radio International. 
And that's Wednesday day night at on 91 FM. This is THE WORLD. I'm 
Lisa Mullins.
