China's central bank chief has warned that risks to the country's 
financial system ``can no longer be ignored'' and pledged tougher 
regulation of the shaky banking sector. In an article published Monday 
in the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, People's Bank of China 
governor Dai Xianglong cited rising debts among state banks, small 
financial firms and local government-run trust and investment houses. 
Dai said there were too many trust and investment companies _ which 
act as investment arms of local governments _ and many were putting 
short-term deposits into speculative property ventures. The People's 
Bank shut down the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp. 
in October because it couldn't pay dlrs 2 billion in debts. In the 
People's Daily article, Dai said ``several'' of the 240 local trust 
companies ``now face difficulties'' because of inadequate supervision. 
In addition, Dai noted the ``relatively high'' proportion of bad loans 
at state commercial banks and small and medium-size financial institutions. 
The People's Bank has said more than 20 percent of all state bank 
loans are non-performing, mainly those to inefficient state industries. 
``In our financial industry, there are some risks that can no longer 
be ignored,'' Dai wrote. He called it ``utterly essential'' to intensify 
regulation of companies trading in securities and the insurance industry. 
Aside from tighter banking regulations, Dai indicated little change 
in other financial policies. He said that for the medium to long term, 
monetary policies will remain ``appropriately tight'' to keep inflation 
at bay. Citing more than dlrs 140 billion in foreign reserves, Dai 
vowed to maintain the stability of China's currency, the yuan. The 
People's Daily article was written to commemorate the central bank's 
50th anniversary, and Dai, who became the bank's chief in 1995, lauded 
the institution's achievements.
