Claiming that Israel's occupation of south Lebanon is ``dictated by 
reality,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on Monday ruled out 
removing his soldiers despite mounting casualties in a guerrilla war 
there. Opposition to Israel's military presence in Lebanon has flared 
as seven Israeli solders died in the last two weeks. But Israeli leaders 
insisted that soldiers must remain to protect Israeli border villages 
from attacks by Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas. Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday he understood the protesters' 
concern. ``Our heart is with every mother and every person who has 
suffered'' because of Israel's military presence in Lebanon, he told 
Israel radio. However, he added that ``we have the responsibility 
to do the right thing for the state of Israel, not for the next newscast.'' 
Mordechai appeared Monday before parliament's Defense and Foreign 
Affairs committee. Afterwards, he said that keeping Israeli soldiers 
in Israel's self-declared ``security zone'' is the only option, and 
``this is the opinion of security officials after they examined all 
the possibilities.'' Opposition legislator Yossi Beilin, who advocates 
a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, stormed out of the committee 
session, slammed the door, and called Mordechai ``a liar.'' ``It's 
nonsense,'' fumed the normally soft-spoken Beilin, who holds a doctorate 
in political science. ``There are many (Israeli) generals who believe 
we must leave this area,'' he declared, ``and I'm sure the minister 
knows it.'' Beilin said the security zone was a ``death trap.'' Israel's 
security Cabinet met Sunday for four hours and heard briefings from 
military commanders about the escalating clashes between Israeli forces 
and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon. During the meeting, opponents 
of Israel's occupation demonstrated outside, chanting, ``Lebanon is 
a disaster.'' A front-page commentary in the Israeli newspaper Yediot 
Ahronot predicted that the fuss over Lebanon would die down after 
a few days without new Israeli casualties in Lebanon _ as it has before. 
Columnist Nahum Barnea said the special Cabinet debate on Lebanon 
was convened less to find answers than to appease the public. ``All 
eyes were not focused on the blood-drenched strip of land in Lebanon, 
but rather on the public opinion polls in Lebanon,'' Barnea wrote. 
Lebanon's government, demanding an unconditional Israeli pullout, 
says that if the Israelis leave, Hezbollah would have no reason to 
strike. Hezbollah refuses to give Israel any assurances. The Israelis 
have charged that Syria is behind the escalation of Hezbollah attacks 
against Israeli forces, as a way of pressuring Israel. Until recently, 
Israeli policy held that Israel could not withdraw its forces from 
Lebanon in the absence of a peace agreement involving Syria. But the 
Syrians have made it clear that the price for such an agreement is 
return of all of the Golan Heights, strategic highlands overlooking 
Israel's north and captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's 
government rejects that. Mordechai said that Israel is constantly 
looking for a political solution to the Lebanon conflict, but none 
is attainable now.
