The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 1: New York 
politicians are salivating over the $25 billion the state is expected 
to receive over the next 25 years as part of the proposed $206 billion 
multi-state settlement with the tobacco industry. But some hurdles 
still need to be cleared. State Supreme Court Justice Stephen Crane, 
who is overseeing the state's lawsuit, will have to approve the settlement. 
Many health experts, including former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, 
oppose the deal as being insufficient to reduce teen-age smoking. 
Some anti-smoking advocates are seeking to present their views in 
court before any deal is instituted. They should be afforded that 
opportunity, given the far-reaching impact of this settlement. If 
the deal is approved, the money should be dedicated to anti-smoking 
programs and other health uses. The deal itself contains no restrictions 
on how states spend the money. Attorney General Dennis Vacco has indicated 
only that the state will share the proceeds equally with New York's 
62 counties. Politicians will be tempted to siphon off the money for 
myriad uses that have nothing to do with tobacco control or health 
care. Senator-elect Charles Schumer has even suggested that half of 
the money be used for local property tax relief. That kind of mischief 
would make a settlement that is already weak on health measures even 
worse. The advertising restrictions have too many loopholes to prevent 
the industry from targeting the youth market. The new deal contains 
no ``look-back'' penalties for the industry if teen-age smoking continues 
to soar. It is therefore imperative that states use a good share of 
the money to counter the industry's marketing efforts. Congress and 
President Clinton have a significant role to play in this fight. They 
have leverage through a strong legal argument that the federal government 
has a right to part of the settlement since it provides about 50 percent 
of the Medicaid funds that state attorneys general were trying to 
recover. Indeed, a federal waiver by Congress may be required for 
the states to keep all the money. Clinton should work with Congress 
to set conditions on any waiver to insure that states use the money 
to improve health care, particularly for children, and to combat smoking. 
Allowing state legislatures complete control over the tobacco spoils 
could result in no public health benefit at all.
