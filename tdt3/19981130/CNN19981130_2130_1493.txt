When it comes to Hollywood profits, creating characters for the screen 
is only half the battle. A tie-in with toys can be just as profitable. 
Jim Moret looks at the latest offerings. The line started early to 
get one of this season's hottest holiday toys -- a limited-edition 
snowflake Pooh. People have lined up outside the store as early as 
4:00 in the morning to try to make sure that they got in line and 
make sure that they could get a Voucher so they could get their own, 
and they're only entitled to one. Had to have this for my collection. 
So it was worth it. It's very cute. Very holiday. They said it was 
going to be a holiday Bean bag. But Disney has much more than Bean 
bags, with hundreds of toys based on the new film, "A bug's life." 
These kids fall in love with the characters, and they want to take 
them with them. So we'll create apparel, and they can wear them to 
school, or we create luggage, and they get to take them on the road. 
So it's really creating products that will allow kids to relive scenes 
from the movie or play out new scenes that they create in their own 
minds. a huge cable hit and top box office draw, "rugrats" are also 
likely to top holiday wish lists. A walking, talking, interactive 
"babe" hits the toy stores just as the movie hits the theaters. For 
the tiny tots, there are teletubbies -- and tigger, too. "Blue's clues" 
makes her way from TV to the toy store. Dreamworks is hoping the video 
release of "small soldiers" will add some punch to its holiday toy 
lineup. We try to make sure that our toy lines reflect the fantasy 
in the movie. If the entertainment is delivering, and the fantasy 
is there, kids are just naturally going to want to bring those toys 
home. Adults can take home an erica kane doll from "all my children" 
or the dancing baby from "Ally McBeal." Ooga-chukka. Ooga-ooga-ooga-chukka. 
Ooga-ooga -- I-I-I'm hooked on a feeling It's one of those great classic 
toys that we think is going to be happy, make people happy of all 
different ages -- kids, parents, singles, just goes across the spectrum. 
It really makes you smile, makes you feel good. And for a toy, that's 
the bottom line. Jim Moret, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
