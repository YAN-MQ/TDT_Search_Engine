Only the Austrian women's team managed to deflect the spotlight from 
the men. While Stephan Eberharter won a super-G and Thomas Stangassinger 
a slalom in this Colorado resort, Austria's Renate Goetschl won two 
downhills and Alexandra Meissnitzer a super-G to give the unit nicknamed 
the ``Power Team'' five victories in three days and eight in 11 races 
this season. Stangassinger, at 33 the oldest racer on the men's tour, 
gave Austria its first slalom title of the season by holding off the 
second-run charge of France's Sebastian Amiez. The Frenchman, only 
22nd after Saturday's first run, outlasted all challengers until Stangassinger 
came down Aspen Mountain. ``I knew Amiez must have had a special run,'' 
Stangassinger said. ``I had to wait a very long time for my second 
run, and I knew the snow was getting softer. ``I tried to have an 
easy, good run. I tried to find a feeling and not be too fast through 
the first gates. My skiing style is to look for the cleanest line. 
It was enough.'' But Amiez was not so happy. ``My first run was no 
good,'' he said. ``It's the first time in my career I've been so slow. 
I was upset between runs and said to myself, `Let's go for it.''' 
Although he lost most of his 1.47-second lead over Amiez, Stangassinger 
prevailed by .26 seconds. Stangassinger's combined time for two runs 
was 1 minute, 27.32 seconds. Amiez was timed in 1:27.58 and Norway's 
Tom Stiansen claimed third in 1:27.69, .01 better than teammate Kjetil 
Andre Aamodt. Another Norwegian, Finn Christian Jagge, also made a 
big move in the afternoon, using the fastest second run to improve 
21 places to finish seventh. ``When I finished the second run in front 
of Jagge, I had a good feeling,'' Amiez said. ``I was starting to 
hope for a top-10 finish. Then, as each racer came down, I realized 
I could finish higher.'' Italian Angelo Weiss, who started 38th but 
placed ninth after the initial run, finished fifth in 1:27.82. Austrian 
Christian Mayer was sixth in 1:27.94. Austria had a chance to sweep 
the podium, but Mayer fell back after placing third in the morning 
and second-place Mario Reiter straddled a gate within sight of the 
finish line. Stangassinger, the 1994 Olympic champion, finished second 
in the slalom standings behind teammate Thomas Sykora in 1997 and 
1998 and then decided to retire. He changed his mind during the summer, 
however, saying he couldn't pass up the excitement of racing against 
the new skiers on the tour. And, he added, it was even better to beat 
them. After deciding to come back, Stangassinger's bid for bigger 
prizes got a major boost when Sykora went down with an injured patellar 
tendon. He's expected to miss at least six weeks, which makes Stangassinger 
the favorite for the slalom title and for the gold medal in the World 
Alpine Ski Championships at Vail, Colo., starting Jan. 31. Bode Miller 
of Franconia, N.H., was the top American in the race, but his time 
of 45.98 seconds for the first run wasn't enough to get him into the 
field of 30 for the second run. He was 34th.
