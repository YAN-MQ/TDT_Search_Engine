Russia's government has postponed crisis budget talks until after 
this week's visit by the head of the International Monetary Fund. 
Moscow correspondent Peter Heinline reports Russia's financial planner 
still hold out hope of continued IMF assistance. A Cabinet meeting 
on budget matters was to have been held Monday, but shortly before 
it was to begin, First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov rushed to 
reporters with a hasty announcement. He said, "We're not ready. We 
haven't finished calculating the final figures." Russia's media scoffed 
at one reporter called, "this flimsy excuse." News agencies said the 
delay was due to the impending visit of IMF managing director Michelle 
Komdasu. But a statement issued later said the meeting had been put 
off until at least December 10th to give time to consider a proposed 
tax cut. Mr. Komdasu arrives Tuesday for talks with Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov and other senior officials about plans to pull the 
country out of financial crisis. The IMF suspended a $22.6 billion 
loan package after the crisis erupted in August saying the Primakov 
government's recovery strategy was unrealistic. In a Saturday interview, 
Mr. Primakov expressed exasperation with what he described as these 
young kids from the IMF dictating economic policy to Russia. But the 
prime minister admitted his government needs the fund's money if it 
is to avoid what he called unpopular measures to pull the country 
out of crisis. He said if the IMF ultimately releases the money, it 
would be used to pay foreign debts and to pump desperately needed 
cash into Russia's sagging economy. In a separate interview, finance 
minister Mikhail Zadornov said IMF help is also essential if Russia 
is to persuade its creditors to reschedule or write off loans. Another 
official was quoted as saying the latest draft budget assumes that 
Russia will receive the $17.5 billion the IMF promised in July, but 
then froze when the crisis broke a month later. Peter Heinline, VOA
