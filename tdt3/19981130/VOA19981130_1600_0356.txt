United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan says in the event of a 
new weapons inspection crisis with Iraq, the United States and Britain 
would likely strike immediately and not seek negotiations. In an interview 
with French radio, Mr. Annan said the two countries have indicated 
they will act based on existing U.N. resolutions without waiting for 
another Security Council meeting. U.S. and British military strikes 
against Iraq were narrowly averted in mid November when Saddam Hussein, 
in a last minute decision, agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. 
arms inspections.
