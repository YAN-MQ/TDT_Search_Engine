A last-minute court order blocked the sale of Rio de Janeiro state's 
water utility on Monday, the Rio Stock Exchange said. A judge suspended 
the auction at the request of a labor union that contended the state 
had not met all the legal requirements for public hearings on the 
sale. The auction of the utility, known as Cedae, has been postponed 
several times this year. Opponents question the government's motives 
to sell the company barely a month before Gov. Marcello Alencar leaves 
office on Dec. 31. His successor, Anthony Garotinho, opposes the sale. 
Hundreds of riot police with horses and dogs stood guard at the Stock 
Exchange in downtown Rio, but there were no incidents with the protesters 
gathered outside. An explosion occurred Monday in the company's downtown 
headquarters, but police could not confirm that it was a bomb. The 
blast blew out a door, but no one was hurt. Two groups were signed 
up to bid for the company, which serves 10 million customers. The 
minimum bid price was set at 1 billion reals, or dlrs 833 million.
