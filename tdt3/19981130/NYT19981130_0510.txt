Vanderbilt University announced Monday that it had received stock 
currently valued at more than $300 million, which may be the largest 
private gift ever made to an American college or university. The gift 
was made by Martha Ingram, chairwoman of Ingram Industries Inc., a 
privately held wholesale distribution company based in Nashville, 
Tenn. Mrs. Ingram set the gift in motion by contributing 20 million 
shares of Ingram Micro Inc., a computer distribution company spun 
off by Ingram Industries two years ago, to the Ingram Charitable Fund, 
a family charity established in 1990. The fund's charter specifies 
that it must dedicate 40 percent of its income and assets to Vanderbilt. 
So at $42.50 a share, Monday's closing price for Ingram Micro, the 
gift would be worth $340 million to the university. Whether that is 
a record is a matter of conjecture. In 1994, Sir Harold Acton donated 
a 57-acre Italian estate, an art collection and other valuable assets 
to New York University. The value of that gift was estimated at as 
much as $500 million, but because so much of it was relatively illiquid, 
the estimates were regarded as tenuous. Beyond doubt, though, the 
gift to Vanderbilt is one of the largest ever, outstripping the $295 
million to Emory University in 1996 and the $240 million to the University 
of California at San Francisco earlier this year. Vanderbilt University, 
founded in 1873 by a $1 million gift from the railroad magnate Cornelius 
Vanderbilt, is a private research university in Nashville with about 
10,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students in 10 schools 
and colleges, a medical center and a wide range of research institutes. 
The largest previous gift to Vanderbilt was $41 million, from Harold 
Stirling Vanderbilt, a grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, in 1970. 
In an interview Monday, the university's chancellor, Joe Wyatt, said 
that there were no formal restrictions on the Ingram gift but that 
he could not specify what uses would be made of it until he had had 
further discussion with Mrs. Ingram and members of her family. The 
Ingram family has had a half-century's association with Vanderbilt. 
Mrs. Ingram's husband, Bronson Ingram, whom she succeeded as head 
of Ingram Industries, was a trustee of the university, and three of 
their four children graduated from it. In addition, Ingram's father, 
Orrin Henry Ingram, was a trustee from 1952 to 1963. Wyatt said that 
while he was surprised by the enormous size of the gift, he had been 
aware that a major contribution was being planned by the Ingram family. 
Wyatt said he had frequently discussed the prospect with Bronson Ingram, 
who was president of the trustees from 1991 until his death in 1995. 
``Bronson was one of those who talked to me in 1982 about coming down 
here to this job,'' said Wyatt, who at the time was vice president 
for administration at Harvard University. ``I worked on this with 
him, and he understood very well that in the long run resources have 
everything to do with what can be accomplished.'' While some educational 
institutions, like Harvard University, stockpile gifts in their endowments, 
a handful, like New York University, have spent much of the bounty 
of their successful fund-raising campaigns to hire top-flight faculty, 
build cutting-edge facilities and bolster financial-aid packages to 
attract superior students. Wyatt said he was well aware of the distinction 
and would expect that with the guidance of the Ingram family he would 
put ``a significant'' share of the gift into the university's endowment 
($1.5 billion before the gift, putting Vanderbilt among the 20 wealthiest 
institutions) and devote another amount to ``capital programs such 
as laboratories and facilities to enhance our education and research 
programs.''
