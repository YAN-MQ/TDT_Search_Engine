The only thing worse than being talked about, Oscar Wilde once said, 
is not being talked about. Well, almost a century after he shocked 
Victorian society with both his writings and his homosexuality, Wilde 
is once again the talk of the town in London. That's because the city 
that once cast stones at Wilde in a humiliating public trial has now 
cast him in stone instead. In the heart of London's theater district, 
Wilde's great grandson today unveiled "A Conversation with Oscar Wilde." 
It's a nine-foot long coffin-like slab of granite with a bronze likeness 
of Wilde's head and hand at one end. Sculptress Maggie Hanling says 
it's meant as an interactive work saying should the passerby choose 
to, he or she can sit on the coffin and have a conversation with Wilde, 
sort of. But British actor Nigel Hotherin says he would have preferred 
something a little less down to earth for the noted author. I think 
he's a sort of person that should been on a pedestal, because that's 
really how he saw himself. It would have been rather more appropriate 
I think. He was somebody that people looked up to. Regardless of what 
the statue looks like, many are happy that London is finally giving 
Oscar Wilde his due. Actor Steven Fye played Wilde in a recent movie. 
I think it's a wonderful memory in recognition of his views after 
William Shakespeare, the most published and read English language 
writer in Europe. And it's been something of an anomaly not to mention 
disgrace that he hasn't been memorialized here before. At the foot 
of the granite, a quote from Oscar Wilde reads, "We are all in the 
gutter but some of us are looking at the stars.
