Hundreds of Pakistanis and a handful of human rights demonstrators 
awaited Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the Norwegian capital 
Monday during a brief stop over on his way to meetings in Washington 
D.C. Sharif was in Oslo on an informal visit to open transmissions 
of Pakistani television programs to Europe via a Norwegian satellite. 
The opening ceremony at the Oslo Concert House was broadcast to 42 
countries in Asia and 18 European countries. Pakistani residents of 
Norway who packed the concert hall, repeatedly applauded the prime 
minister during his 45-minute, Urdu language speech. Sharif touched 
on Pakistan's first nuclear tests this year and the international 
sanctions that followed. Pakistan and India, which have fought three 
wars in the past 50, both tested nuclear devices in May, leading to 
fears of a nuclear arms race in South Asia. The United States and 
other Western countries imposed sanctions on Pakistan, which has been 
on the verge of economic collapse. In Oslo, demonstrators were more 
concerned with a 1985 law in overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan that allows 
the death penalty for anyone convicted of blasphemy against Islam. 
In May, Pakistani Roman Catholic Bishop John Joseph, 65, killed himself 
to protest a blasphemy death sentence imposed on a fellow Pakistani 
Christian, which lead to widespread protests. Outside the Oslo Concert 
Hall, about two dozen demonstrators chanted ``No, No, Blasphemy Law'' 
when Sharif left the building. The protesters, from Amnesty International, 
also carried banners saying ``Blasphemy Trials: A way to judicial 
murder.'' Sharif was bound for Washington D.C. in hopes of convincing 
president Clinton to lift sanctions against Pakistan. His stop in 
Norway was the first by any Pakistani prime minister.
