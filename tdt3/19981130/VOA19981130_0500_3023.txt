As for the US economy, Lawrence Kudlow, Chief Economist at American 
Scandia Life Insurance Corporation is very optimistic going forward. 
The big point is wages and salaries are growing a lot. And even adjusted 
for inflation they are up 5 percent year on year. That's a big number. 
And capital gains from the stock market have been very substantial. 
You know, after we held our breath this summer, it's been a great 
story. And I think that the job story, though slower, is still going 
to sustain it. So, my guess you've got a 3 percent growth in the 4th 
Quarter, and probably Christmas sales will be one of the backbones. 
Mr. Kudlow believes inflation will remain at or near zero next year 
with oil prices dipping into single digits per barrel. He expects 
the US Central Bank to continue cutting interest rates. The benchmark 
Dow Jones Industrial Average Index resumes trading at 9333 after a 
modest gain of 19 points, Friday.
