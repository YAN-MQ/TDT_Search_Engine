Israeli lawmakers, frustrated by mounting troop casualties in Lebanon, 
lashed out at one another Monday as the national debate over Israel's 
presence there widened. Yossi Beilin, from the opposition Labor party 
who advocates a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, said leaving troops 
there meant ``certain death,'' for young Israeli servicemen. He charged 
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai with ``gambling with their 
lives.'' Mordechai, a former army general, said Israel's occupation 
of south Lebanon is ``dictated by reality,'' and ruled out removing 
his soldiers despite the recent death toll in a guerrilla war there. 
``I am gambling with the lives of Israeli soldiers, I fought my whole 
life here,'' Mordechai said after the two men walked out of a heated 
session of Israel's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee devoted 
to discuss on Lebanon. Israel has patrolled a small strip of land 
in south Lebanon since 1985 in an effort to halt cross-border attacks 
by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas on Israel's northern communities. 
Opposition to Israel's military presence has intensified however since 
seven Israeli soldiers were killed there in the last two weeks. Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that soldiers must remain in 
their positions in order to protect Israeli border villages from Hezbollah. 
``Our heart is with every mother and every person who has suffered'' 
because of Israel's military presence in Lebanon, he told Israel radio. 
But ``we have the responsibility to do the right thing for the state 
of Israel, not for the next newscast,'' he said. Mordechai told reporters 
that keeping Israeli soldiers in Israel's self-declared ``security 
zone'' is the only option, and ``this is the opinion of security officials 
after they examined all the possibilities.'' Beilin stormed out of 
the committee session, slammed the door, and called Mordechai ``a 
liar.'' ``It's nonsense,'' fumed Beilin, normally a soft-spoken academic 
type with a doctorate in political science. ``There are many (Israeli) 
generals who believe we must leave this area,'' he declared, ``and 
I'm sure the minister knows it.'' Israel's security Cabinet met for 
four hours Sunday and heard briefings from military commanders about 
the escalating clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas 
in south Lebanon. During the meeting, opponents of Israel's occupation 
in south Lebanon demonstrated outside, chanting, ``Lebanon is a disaster.'' 
A front-page commentary in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot predicted 
that the fuss over Lebanon would die down after a few days without 
new Israeli casualties in Lebanon, as it has before. Columnist Nahum 
Barnea said the special Cabinet debate on Lebanon was convened not 
so much in hopes of finding answers, but to appease the public. ``All 
eyes were not focused on the blood-drenched strip of land in Lebanon, 
but rather on the public opinion polls in Lebanon,'' Barnea wrote. 
Lebanon's government, demanding an unconditional Israeli pullout, 
says that if the Israelis leave, Hezbollah would have no reason to 
strike. Hezbollah refuses to give Israel any assurances. The Israelis 
have charged that Syria is behind the escalation of Hezbollah attacks 
against Israeli forces, as a way of pressuring Israel. Until recently, 
Israeli policy held that Israel could not withdraw its forces from 
Lebanon in the absence of a peace agreement involving Syria. But the 
Syrians have made it clear that the price for such an agreement is 
return of all of the Golan Heights, strategic highlands overlooking 
Israel's north and captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's 
government rejects that. Mordechai said that Israel is constantly 
looking for a political solution to the Lebanon conflict, but none 
is attainable now.
