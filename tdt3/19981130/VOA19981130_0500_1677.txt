The captain of the Federation Starship Voyager is going to be spending 
a lot of time, not in outer space or cruising around between the galaxies, 
but in Cleveland, Ohio. Right, actress Kate Mulgrew, the star of the 
sci-fi television series, "Star Trek Voyager" is engaged to marry 
Tim Hagan, a politician from the Cleveland area. He is the Cuyahoga 
county commissioner. Now Cuyahoga county is the county that Cleveland's 
located in. The couple met five years ago through mutual friends at 
the US embassy in Ireland. Both Mr. Hagan and Ms. Mulgrew have been 
married, the actress has two sons. Now Kate Mulgrew is expected to 
live in Cleveland with her husband when she is not working on her 
TV show. The couple plans to get married next year during the springtime 
break in the filming of "Star Trek Voyager". The Groom-to-be joked 
about the story line on the TV series. He said he and Ms. Mulgrew 
will marry as soon as she gets back from Delta Quadrant. I've said 
that to my wife many times. Honey, we'll talk when you get back from 
space.
