As the Democratic leaders of the State Assembly proposed a 38 percent 
salary increase for the state's elected officials, Gov. George Pataki 
reiterated Monday that he did not think legislators deserved higher 
pay, but left open the possibility of a deal. Legislators are returning 
here this week, ostensibly for the business of electing their leaders 
for next year, but the question on most of their minds is whether 
they will be able to secure their first raise in 10 years. There is 
overwhelming support for it in both houses of the Legislature. Assembly 
Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, had a bill printed over 
the weekend that would raise the base salary for members of the Assembly 
and the Senate to $79,500 a year from $57,500, starting in January. 
With stipends for leadership and committee positions, legislators 
would earn more than $91,000 on average, making them the second-highest-paid 
state legislators, after California's. The same bill would increase 
the annual salaries for the lieutenant governor, the attorney general 
and the comptroller to $151,500 from $110,000. In a separate resolution, 
the Assembly Democrats proposed raising the governor's pay to $179,000 
from $130,000. Pataki has signaled for months that he did not favor 
a raise, but that he would allow one to become law if he got some 
legislation he valued in return. The most commonly mentioned candidate 
is a law allowing charter schools, specialized or privately run schools 
within the public school system. The majority Republicans in the Senate 
have not printed a bill, but they left no doubt today that they endorsed 
the Assembly proposal. Sen. Joseph Bruno of Brunswick, the majority 
leader, said Monday that the raises in the Assembly bill merely kept 
up with the level of inflation since the previous raise. ``They are 
a cost-of-living adjustment, not an increase in compensation,'' he 
said. ``Do I think a cost-of-living adjustment makes some sense? If 
we're going to vote on anything, then I think that would make some 
sense.'' Legislators' pay has not changed in 10 years. Salaries for 
statewide officeholders have not changed in 12 years. The Assembly 
bill would raise salaries for judges, whose pay last rose six years 
ago, by 21 percent. The pay for a justice of the Supreme Court, the 
state's principal trial court, would rise to $136,700, from $113,000. 
The bill would also give a 38 percent raise to the commissioners of 
state departments, many of whom now earn $90,000 to $105,000 and have 
not had a pay increase in 10 years. The salaries of the governor's 
own staff members are not set by statute and have been raised regularly, 
so that many of the aides now earn well over $100,000 a year. Pataki 
said he favored a pay increase for judges and commissioners but considered 
being a legislator a part-time job. Legislators protest that the work 
is full time, even if the Legislature is only in session six months 
a year, and that most of them do not have outside employment.
