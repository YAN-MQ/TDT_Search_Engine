In US College football, Tennessee remains atop the latest Associated 
Press rankings. Tennessee improved to 11-0 with a 41-0 trouncing of 
Vanderbilt on Saturday. Kansas State tops the weekly poll of coaches, 
even though the team was idle this week. The rest of the top five 
in both polls remains the same: UCLA is third, followed by Florida 
State and Ohio State.
