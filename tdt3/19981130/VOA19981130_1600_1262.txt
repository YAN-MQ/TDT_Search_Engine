The University of Connecticut has taken over the top spot in the Associated 
Press Men's College Basketball poll released Monday. The Huskies capitalized 
on Duke's loss in the championship game at the Great Alaska Shootout 
Saturday to move up one spot and replace the Blue Devils. Maryland 
moved up three spots to take over second place in the poll, garnering 
16 first place votes after winning the Puerto Rico shoot-out. North 
Carolina is third, followed by Duke, which fell to fourth after losing 
to Cincinnati and number five Stanford.
