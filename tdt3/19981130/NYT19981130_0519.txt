A white third-grade teacher said Monday that she feared for her safety 
and would not return to the Brooklyn school where black parents lashed 
out at her use of a book that they believed depicted blacks in a negative 
light. It was undecided where the teacher, Ruth Sherman, would be 
transferred, but it would not be within District 32 in Bushwick, where 
the incident occurred, said Robert Brasco, deputy superintendent. 
Ms. Sherman, 27, was temporarily transferred out of the school a week 
ago after at least two parents publicly threatened her over using 
a book titled ``Nappy Hair'' by Carolivia Herron, a black writer and 
scholar. The class Ms. Sherman taught at Public School 75 is composed 
largely of black and Hispanic students. The book, a coming-of-age 
story about a black girl, received a recommendation for classroom 
use from instructors at Teachers College at Columbia University. But 
some parents were offended by the book's colloquialisms and illustrations, 
which they construed as negative characterizations, officials said. 
The reaction was the opposite of what Ms. Sherman had hoped to achieve 
by reading the book, which was written to build self-esteem. ``My 
love and sympathy for my students remains, and their love and support 
has made my nightmare tolerable,'' Ms. Sherman said in a statement 
released Monday by the United Federation of Teachers, which is assisting 
her. ``But I have experienced abuse and tremendous fear brought on 
by an angry group, and I strongly feel that I am in danger.'' Ms. 
Sherman informed Felix Vazquez, the superintendent, of her decision 
not to return to the district during a 20-minute meeting Monday morning 
at district headquarters. ``It's over'' is all that Ms. Sherman said 
after the meeting as she dashed through the parking lot with her fiance 
and drove off. The conflict began on Nov. 23 at a community meeting 
called to discuss the hiring of an assistant principal. The meeting 
turned raucous when about 10 parents, waving photocopied excerpts 
of the book, complained that it was racially insensitive. At least 
two threatened ``to get'' Ms. Sherman, said Ron Davis, a spokesman 
for the teachers' union. Brasco said the parents could face criminal 
charges for threatening Ms. Sherman. Ms. Sherman was transferred to 
district offices while the superintendent conducted an investigation 
of the book, which was deemed appropriate.
