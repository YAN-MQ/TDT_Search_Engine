She's got big guns, and now she's got a title. A British government 
official said Monday he wants Lara Croft _ the scantily clad, heavily 
armed heroine of the popular ``Tomb Raider'' computer game _ to be 
an ``ambassador'' for the nation's science and technology. Science 
Minister Lord Sainsbury cited the British-created cyber character 
as he chided people for harking back too much to Britain's historical 
inventions. Britain needed to show it was the home of people like 
Professor Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge theoretical physicist who 
wrote ``A Brief History of Time,'' and vacuum cleaner pioneer Dyson, 
and discoveries including Dolly the cloned sheep and optical fibers, 
Sainsbury said in a speech at the Social Market Foundation in London. 
``I want Lara Croft to be an ambassador for British scientific excellence,'' 
he said. The Trade and Industry Department said Sainsbury was using 
the Croft character as an example of modern British innovations for 
which he wanted Britain to be known, in place of the traditional ``cream 
teas and steam engines'' picture.
