Next up, living history in a Brazilian community of the descendants 
of slaves on PRI. Hi, I'm Joe Pesudo Pamaco. WHYY is in the middle 
of a Campaign for Independence, a very important fund-raising drive 
which will give us the tools we need to keep public broadcasting strong 
into the next century. WHYY will not only be a great TV and radio 
station, but also an institution designed to support the educational, 
economic, and cultural affairs of our region. To bring you a wider 
range of digital radio, television, and information services, we're 
building a new broadcast facility and creating a program endowment. 
We've already raised more than $12.5 million toward the $15 million 
goal, including a challenge grant of $1 million from the Creskie Foundation, 
and we're asking you to consider making a $1,000 gift to the Campaign 
for Independence. We'll engrave your name in stone on our new members 
plaza, a special space on Independence Mall. Pledge now and pay for 
it over the course of three years. Call us at 1-800-413-7200 for the 
details. That's 1-800-413-7200. Thanks. This is THE WORLD. I'm Lisa 
Mullins.
