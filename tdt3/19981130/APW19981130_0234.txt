Former prime minister Paul Keating and his wife Annita on Monday announced 
the end of their 23-year marriage, but said their decision should 
not lend credibility to ``malicious'' rumors concerning his Keating's 
private life. The couple, who married in 1975 and who had four children, 
announced their separation in a joint statement. ``We have decided 
amicably to separate after 23 years of deeply fulfilling and for the 
most part happy marriage,'' they said. ``This has been a difficult 
and painful time for both of us, and for our children, and if only 
for their sakes we hope people will respect our privacy. ``The often 
malicious rumors that have been circulating for the past two or three 
years have not helped us to negotiate these difficult years, and we 
sincerely hope this announcement will not lend them credibility. ``It 
would be futile to attempt to publicly explain the reasons for this 
decision, and we are sure no reasonable person would feel that we 
are obliged to try.'' Unfounded rumors about Keating surfaced publicly 
recently when former governor-general Bill Hayden aired them in a 
defamation case in Canberra unrelated to the Keatings. Hayden, like 
Keating a former federal Labor leader, told a court about baseless 
stories that Keating had had an extramarital affair with a prominent 
woman, and that he had a predilection for young men. Hayden said he 
was simply attempting to show the damage that sex smears could do 
to politicians' reputations.
