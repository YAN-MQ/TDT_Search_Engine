Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has ruled out the 
possibility of a unilateral withdrawal from Southern Lebanon. NPR's 
Eric Winer reports from Jerusalem. Netanyahu made the announcement 
after meeting with his top security advisers. He says Israel will 
only withdraw its soldiers if the Lebanese Army guarantees security 
along Israel's northern border. But Lebanese officials and their Syrian 
backers refuse to provide such guarantees. They insist Israel must 
withdraw unconditionally. A growing number of Israelis, 40 percent, 
according to one poll, believe their government should do just that. 
One leading opposition figure called the so-called security zone in 
Southern Lebanon a death trap. In the past two weeks, seven Israeli 
soldiers have been killed by Hezbollah guerrillas. But Israel's top 
Army generals oppose a unilateral withdrawal. They fear it will lead 
Israel's northern most towns vulnerable to attack. This is Eric Winer, 
NPR News, Jerusalem.
