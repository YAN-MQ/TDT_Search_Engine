Jim Turner, the pitching coach for nine Yankee pennant-winning teams 
in the Casey Stengel era and a pitcher for the Braves, Reds and Yankees 
in a baseball career spanning 51 consecutive seasons, died Sunday 
in his hometown of Nashville. He was 95 and the oldest former Yankee. 
In the 1950s, a familiar cast was on hand in pinstripes every March 
at spring training and most Octobers at Yankee Stadium: Manager Stengel 
in the dugout, Turner running the pitching staff, Bill Dickey coaching 
at first base and Frank Crosetti on the lines at third. Turner guided 
staffs led by Allie Reynolds, Vic Raschi, Eddie Lopat and Whitey Ford, 
noting his pitchers' every move in his little black book. ``He knew 
if one of them changed a blade in their razors,'' Phil Rizzuto once 
said. In his first tenure as a Yankee coach _ 1949 to 1959, through 
all but the final season of the Stengel years _ Turner took home seven 
World Series-winning paychecks. After being replaced by Lopat, he 
managed in the minor leagues for one year, then served as a pitching 
coach for Cincinnati's 1961 pennant winner. He remained with the Reds 
for four more seasons, then returned to the Yankees as pitching coach 
from 1966 to 1973 under Manager Ralph Houk. A native of Antioch, Tenn., 
who was known as Milkman Jim for having worked in his family's dairy 
business during the off seasons, Turner spent 14 years in the minors 
before making his major league debut with the 1937 Boston Braves at 
age 33. He was 20-11 for a fifth-place team, leading the National 
League in earned run average at 2.38 and complete games with 24 and 
tying for the lead in shutouts with five. He went 14-11 and made the 
All-Star team in 1938, when Stengel became the Braves' manager, and 
had a 14-7 record for the pennant-winning 1940 Reds. A right-hander, 
Turner pitched for the Yankees in relief from 1942 to 1945 and led 
the American League in saves with 10 in his final season. He had a 
69-60 record over nine years in the majors. He became the Yankees' 
pitching coach in October 1948, one day after Stengel was hired as 
manager. While managing at Portland in the Pacific Coast League while 
Stengel managed Oakland, Turner had shown Raschi how to throw a slow 
curve to go with his fastball, and by the time Turner arrived with 
the Yanks, Raschi was becoming a star with them. When Ford was a rookie 
in 1950, Turner discovered why he was tipping off his pitches. ``Turner 
had me throwing in the bullpen and we found out I was twisting my 
elbow whenever I cranked up for a curveball,'' Ford remembered. Meanwhile, 
Turner wanted to make sure that Ford measured up to the Yankees' standards 
of decorum, Reynolds recalled. ``Turner asked me to room with Whitey, 
who had just come up from the minors,'' Reynolds said. ```Give him 
some class,' Turner said.'' Later in the 1950s, Turner helped Don 
Larsen and Bob Turley gain control of their pitches through no-windup 
deliveries. Johnny Sain, who pitched for the Yankees under Turner, 
regarded him so highly that he emulated Turner's meticulous record-keeping 
when he became the Yankees' pitching coach in 1961. Turner is survived 
by two daughters, Jacquelyn Turner and Dr. Dorothy Turner, and two 
sisters, Alice Turner Smith and Marguerite Turner King, all of Nashville. 
In 1988, Turner looked back with gratitude, designing bronze plaques 
as gifts for Reynolds, Raschi and Lopat. ``I got a letter from Jim,'' 
Lopat recalled. ``He said we had made him rich, did so much for him, 
made him famous, changed his life.'' An old-school type who once remarked 
how ``baseball is not a tea party,'' Turner sought to regulate his 
pitchers' activities off the field, too. He did not want them to do 
any swimming during the afternoon if they were to pitch at night. 
When Bobby Shantz, a Yankee left-hander of the 1950s, did some diving 
at a country club, he asked, ``Am I getting sunburned?'' He feared 
that Turner would notice he had defied his edict. But there were times 
when Turner was not so controlling. Stengel once sent him out to talk 
with Raschi when the pitcher was about to face the strapping Red Sox 
first baseman Walt Dropo. Raschi scowled, and Turner quickly returned 
to the dugout. ``I asked him how he was going to pitch to Dropo,'' 
Turner told Stengel. ``And what did he answer?'' Stengel inquired. 
``Hard,'' said Turner.
