Chile's foreign minister has left London for Madrid, as he continues 
his mission to lobby for the release of former Chilean leader Augusto 
Pinochet. Britain is considering Spain's request for Mr. Pinochet's 
extradition to face charges of genocide and toture. VOA correspondent 
Laurie Kassman reports from London the Chilean foreign minister did 
not have much success in Britain. Chile's foreign minister, Jose Miguel 
Insulsa, met with Britain's defense secretary on Monday before heading 
off to Madrid. The British official gave Mr. Insulsa the same response 
as the foreign secretary last Friday. Britain's government says it 
is keeping its hands off the Pinochet case on the grounds that it 
is a legal not a political issue. Mr. Insulsa has argued that the 
83-year-old former general should be released on humanitarian grounds. 
He also argued that General Pinochet could stand trial back home where 
there are more than one dozen cases pending against him. But that 
appears unlikely because the former general enjoys immunity there 
as a senator for life. For now, it is up to Britain's home secretary, 
Jack Straw, to decide whether to approve Spain's extradition request 
for the former Chilean leader. He refused to meet the Chilean diplomat. 
A leading British daily says that U.S. diplomats also have quietly 
urged Britain to drop the extradition case and let Mr. Pinochet go 
home. The newspaper, "The Guardian," says the CIA does not want the 
case to dredge up its links to the 1973 coup that brought Mr. Pinochet 
to power in Chile. The British home secretary has until December 11th 
to announce his decision. Mr. Pinochet will have to appear in court 
on that date to hear it. The former general's wife describes his as 
depressed. His lawyers have hinted they will argue Mr. Pinochet is 
mentally and physically unfit to stand trial. Mr. Pinochet has been 
under police guard at a private London clinic since his arrest last 
month. He is recuperating from back surgery, but he is expected to 
move this week to a private suite at a London airport hotel and then 
on to a private villa in the countryside while his lawyers continue 
to fight for his release. Laurie Kassman, VOA News, London.
