The Philippine Navy has arrested 20 Chinese fisherman on board six 
fishing vessels near a south China Sea reef claimed by both Manila 
and Beijing. As Ruth Youngblood reports from Manila, the arrests are 
expected to anger China. The Philippines armed forces western command 
reported Monday the fishermen were intercepted five nautical miles 
from Mischief Reef in the Spratley Islands, and brought to a Navy 
detachment in Parawan. Officials say charges of illegal fishing and 
entry would be filed against the Chinese, arrested within the Philippines' 
322 kilometer exclusive economic zone. The intrusion came just as 
tensions between China and the Philippines were easing over China's 
recent activities on Mischief Reef. Tension flared last month, when 
Manila accused Beijing of sending armed naval vessels to the area 
to build what the Philippines said looked like concrete structures 
for military use. Beijing contended the facilities were only shelters 
for fisherman and needed renovation. Acknowledging the Philippines 
outdated military is no match for China's might, President Joseph 
Astrada agreed to China's offer that Filipino fisherman share the 
Mischief Reef shelters. Mischief reef is part of a cluster of small 
islands and outcrops claimed totally or in part by China, the Philippines, 
Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei. The area is believed to be 
rich in oil and gas. China does not recognize the Philippine's economic 
zone under the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea. And 
claims all of the Spratleys are historically Chinese territory. Manila's 
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado had accused China of launching a 
creeping invasion. A 1995 diplomatic battle over Chinese boats on 
the reef concluded in the signing of a code of conduct aimed at preventing 
armed confrontation in the tense area. Officials say its fisherman 
detained Sunday will be interrogated by representatives of the Provincial 
Bureau of Food and Drugs. They say fish, for cyanide fishing, nets, 
boats, etchings, and two dead and endangered tortoises were seized 
from the boats. Ruth Youngblood for VOA News, Manila.
