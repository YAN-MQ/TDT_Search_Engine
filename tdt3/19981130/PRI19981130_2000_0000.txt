This is THE WORLD, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It's Monday, November 30th. I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston. 
Today, President Clinton pledges more U.S. aid for the West Bank in 
Gaza. Familiar faces take their places in Cambodia's new government, 
and a four season end to the antagonisms infecting Canadian political 
discourse. I think ten years from now, Quebec will probably be an 
independent country. And I think everybody will respect each other 
maybe a little bit more. Also today, Chileans disagree over what to 
do about Augusto Pinochet. And a Russian doctor takes care of the 
mighty, the sick, and the mighty sick. First, this news. From National 
Public Radio News in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff.
