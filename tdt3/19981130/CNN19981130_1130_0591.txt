Law enforcement officials in Texas say they are confident they will 
recapture a man who escaped from death row at the state prison. Charles 
Zewe has more on the manhunt. It's a waiting game now. Texas prison 
guards and packs of bloodhounds are waiting for escaped death row 
inmate Martin gurule to make a move. It's been nearly 100 hours since 
the 29-year-old convicted killer got out of the Ellis unit, the place 
where Texas keeps its 454 death row inmates. I hope he is out there, 
72 hours, hungry, chewed up by mosquitos and constantly listening 
to those packs of dogs roaming somewhere near him and knowing it's 
not going to let up. Through the night Sunday, a small army of prison 
guards and state troopers scoured the 17,000 acres around the prison 
where gurule is still believed to be hiding. They checked vehicles 
and went house in the rural area 80 miles north of houston. I couldn't 
believe it. I could not believe it like, how could that have happened? 
Prison officials, meanwhile, are investigating how gurule managed 
to scale two razor wire fences and get away. While he got away six 
other death row inmates, who tried to get out too, surrendered after 
prison guards opened fire. No one was hit. Texas prison officials 
say gurule is the first death row inmate in 64 years to escape. Their 
investigating how he did that in hopes they can prevent it from happening 
again. Charles Zewe, Huntsville, Texas.
