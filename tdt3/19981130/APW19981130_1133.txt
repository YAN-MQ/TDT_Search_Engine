A former paratrooper in the Israeli army accused of killing a British 
tourist and wounding the victim's girlfriend, entered a guilty plea 
to the murder charge Monday in a bargain to reduce a second charge 
against him. Daniel Okev, 45, is charged in the August 1997 shooting 
death of Jeffrey Hunter, 22, and the wounding of Charlotte Gibb. Okev 
gave the British couple a ride in southern Israel and later stopped 
at an isolated spot in the desert and shot them. Okev's lawyer, David 
Yiftach, offered the plea bargain Monday at a session of the Beersheva 
District Court. Okev pleaded guilty to murdering Hunter and the prosecution 
reduced the charge from attempted murder of Gibb to severe attack, 
Yiftach said. Okev claimed that he was suffering from flashbacks at 
the time of the shootings and was severely traumatized by service 
in an army special forces squad which hunted down and executed suspected 
Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip in the early 1970s. Yiftach 
said the military experience coupled with a brain condition Okev probably 
developed after a car accident 15 years ago could have been behind 
his actions. ``The fact that he had a problem in his brain, together 
with the fact that he was brought up to kill people in this special 
unit, this is what the psychiatrists say brought him to do what he 
did,'' Yiftach said. The judges are to decide Jan. 18 whether Okev 
would be eligible for a reduced sentence because of his mental condition. 
He faces a life sentence if found guilty for the murder. Yiftach said 
he had wanted to bring Gibb for questioniung but the young British 
woman wrote in a letter to the court that it would be too traumatic 
for her to face Okev.
