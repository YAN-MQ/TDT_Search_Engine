The tape's contents may have been incendiary, but its impact was muted. 
District prosecutors in the southern city of Kaohsiung said Monday 
they discovered signs of editing on a tape purporting to be mayor 
Wu Den-yih whispering sweet nothings to a mistress. Their findings 
raised questions about the tape's authenticity, offering Wu some relief 
at the height of a re-election campaign in which he has been accused 
of infidelity and lying. Surrounded by cheering supporters at the 
courthouse in Kaohsiung, Wu instantly went on the offensive by offering 
a 2 million Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 62,000) reward for the original 
tape from which he says the copy was pieced together. ``I'm grateful 
that this report has finally returned my innocence. ... We're going 
to find who is behind this,'' Wu told reporters. Kaoshiung, 300 kilometers 
(186 miles) south of Taipei, is Taiwan's second largest city. Wu still 
leads in opinion surveys for the elections Saturday, when the mayor 
of Taipei and the 225-seat national legislature will also be chosen. 
But he has faced a tougher than expected challenge in his bid for 
a third eight-year term from the Democratic Progressive Party's Frank 
Hsieh, whose party has already won the neighboring counties away from 
Wu's Nationalists. Chen Chun-sheng, the DPP city council candidate 
who released the tape, rejected the prosecutor's report, saying other 
independent analyses _ including one performed in the United States 
_ had shown the tape to be credible. Whether the tape actually contained 
Wu's voice, possibly edited to form new sentences, remained unclear. 
Wu has labeled the tape a crude smear attack, and suggested that Hsieh 
was behind it, a claim Hsieh has denied. Wu is not the only incumbent 
who has faced attacks on his sexual morals this year. Taipei Mayor 
Chen Shui-bian of the DPP was forced to deny accusations by a former 
ally that he had slipped into the Portuguese enclave of Macau numerous 
times to gamble and visit prostitutes. Chen's accuser has been unable 
to present direct evidence proving his claims.
