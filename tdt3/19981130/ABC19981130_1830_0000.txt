On "World News Tonight" this Monday -- big changes in the country's 
gun-control laws. As of today, an immediate background check for anyone 
who wants to buy any gun from a licensed dealer. Two of the country's 
economic giants, Ford and General Motors. Did they really collaborate

by a foreign firm. Are Americans worried anymore? And trying to record 
the Asian Tiger on film, when his enemy showed up.
