The house Judiciary committee is hearing testimony today from several 
witnesses as it continues its impeachment inquiry. The committee questioned 
democratic donor Nathan Landow this morning. It's also expected to 
hear today from President Clinton's attorney Robert bennett and deputy 
White House counsel Bruce Lindsey. Additional testimony will come 
tomorrow from convicted perjurers and federal judges. The public hearing 
will detail the consequences of perjury, which many republicans contend 
is the central issue. Some democrats say there is no proof the president 
perjured himself and no legal basis for equating perjury with impeachment.
