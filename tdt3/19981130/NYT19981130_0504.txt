The acrimonious negotiations are over. Cablevision and Time Warner 
have put up the money. On March 13, Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis 
will step into the ring at Madison Square Garden to determine the 
undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. It will be the first 
heavyweight championship bout at the Garden since 1993, when Riddick 
Bowe retained his title against Michael Dokes. And the winner will 
be the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Bowe defeated Holyfield 
on Nov. 13, 1992. Madison Square Garden is hoping to re-establish 
itself as a historical monument to some of the world's greatest fights. 
Although the bout would have difficulty matching the Muhammad Ali-Joe 
Frazier fight in 1971, a card featuring two best heavyweights in the 
world will go a long way toward erasing some of the inglorious moments 
the Garden has suffered. Lewis (34-1) is the World Boxing Council 
champion, and Holyfield (36-3) holds the World Boxing Association 
and International Boxing Federation titles. After a bout between Bowe 
and Andrew Golota in 1996, a riot broke out inside and outside the 
ring when Bowe's manager, Rock Newman, and members of Bowe's entourage 
threw punches at members of Golota's corner. And this past June, a 
bout between Holyfield and Henry Akinwande was canceled when Akinwande 
tested positive for hepatitis B and a female boxer on the card turned 
out to be 21 weeks pregnant. Unless something equally bizarre happens 
this time around, the Holyfield-Lewis card could be the kind of signature 
event that puts the Garden back on the big-time boxing map. ``Frankly, 
we're tired of hearing everyone say that the last time we had big 
fight here was 1971,'' Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, 
said. ``This fight puts the Garden back in the fight business in a 
big way. Whenever there's a fight that's compelling, you have to think 
of the Garden.'' Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, which 
owns the arena, the Knicks and Rangers, put up just over $8 million 
to stage the fight at Madison Square Garden. That bid went beyond 
anything that Las Vegas or Atlantic City would come up with. ``No 
one thought we would be able to capture this event,'' Dolan said. 
``This setting is unlike any venue in the world. We like to think 
that the name of the Garden went a long way to attracting this fight 
on March 13, 1999.'' With around 19,000 seats and tickets priced from 
$1,500 for ringside to a minimum of $100, Checketts said he hoped 
that the fight would be a sellout and earn a gate of $10 million. 
Time Warner and HBO Sports guaranteed Holyfield $20 million to gain 
his commitment. They hope the fight will have more than a million 
pay-per-view orders to prevent a loss. It's a risk considering that 
Lewis has never come close to producing a million pay-per-view orders. 
Holyfield has gone over a million in bouts against Mike Tyson, George 
Foreman and Bowe. ``I don't believe we're going to lose money on this 
fight,'' said Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner and HBO Sports. 
``We have a substantial guarantee upfront on this fight. But we pride 
ourselves on putting on the best fights in boxing. My boss didn't 
ask me if we were going to make money or lose money when I first told 
him about this fight. He asked me if it was a good fight. I believe 
it is.'' The fight would not have happened without the promoter Don 
King. King pulled the fight together by getting Lewis to agree to 
a $9.5 million purse, and then mended his relationship with Abraham. 
The two men were partners in boxing events for HBO Sports 13 years 
ago, before a bitter split in their business relationship drove a 
wedge between them. Their acrimony got in the way of the original 
negotiation, which fell apart because Lewis' exclusive deal with HBO 
did not allow King to shop the fight to Showtime, which was apparently 
willing to offer more than the $16 million HBO had been offering. 
``Sharing a boxing podium with Don King must be like dating your ex-wife,'' 
Abraham said. ``You think it's the best thing, but only time and another 
date will tell.'' As for the two boxers, they were just pleased that 
the fight had finally been made. Lewis said he was playing golf when 
he heard the news, but that it didn't send him jumping up and down 
on the links. Lewis said Holyfield had been ducking him and that the 
pressure from outside influences finally made Holyfield step up to 
take the fight.
