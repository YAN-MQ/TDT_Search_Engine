It's 21 hours 18 universal time. Here's the hour's top stories. President 
Clinton is urging increased financial support for the Palestinians 
to keep the peace process with Israel strong. We'll have more on that 
and the rest of this hour's top news in our next summary 12 minutes 
from now. It's time now for sports, and here once again is Parke Brewer. 
Thank you very much, Tony.
