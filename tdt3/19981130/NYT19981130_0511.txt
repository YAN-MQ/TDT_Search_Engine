Dennis Vacco all but conceded defeat Monday in his bid for re-election 
as New York's attorney general. His campaign dropped its challenge 
of thousands of uncounted ballots from the Nov. 3 election and said 
it accepted state tallies showing Eliot Spitzer in the lead. Vacco, 
the Republican incumbent, had fought for weeks to delay the opening 
of paper ballots that had been challenged by the two sides. As a result, 
more than 20,000 ballots remain to be counted _ a number roughly equal 
to Spitzer's lead _ out of 4.2 million cast. But on Monday, Thomas 
Spargo, Vacco's lawyer, acknowledged what Spitzer's campaign had long 
contended: that the disputed ballots were likely only to increase 
Spitzer's margin of victory. Most of the challenges came from the 
Vacco campaign, and they involved ballots cast in largely black and 
Hispanic areas in New York City and other heavily Democratic areas. 
``It's not reasonable to expect that, when you open the paper ballots 
that are set aside around this state, the outcome of the election 
will be different than it is now,'' Spargo said after a hearing in 
state Supreme Court, a trial court, in Manhattan. State election officials 
said they would tally the remaining ballots this week and declare 
the final results on Monday. On Nov. 19, Spitzer, saying that it was 
mathematically impossible for Vacco to win, declared victory and began 
assembling a transition team, although Vacco declined to concede or 
to cooperate with any transition efforts. In the end, Vacco's lawyer 
said, ``There was not a mathematical basis on the information I have 
today to overturn the election.'' Still, he added, ``That doesn't 
mean that this week and next week that I will not be reviewing all 
the data I have accumulated to examine whether or not there is another 
area that may have an impact significant enough to affect a 20,000- 
or 25,000-vote margin.'' ``Now that the Republican lawyers have all 
but conceded, Vacco's choice is obvious,'' said Steven Goldstein, 
press secretary to Spitzer's campaign. ``He can now cooperate in the 
transition, or have his name forever accompanied by an asterisk denoting 
the most graceless exit in state political history.'' In the last 
few weeks, Vacco's lawyers have made several charges of election irregularities. 
They first said that 37,000 votes had appeared without explanation 
after the unofficial Election Day tally by the Board of Elections. 
Later, Vacco's lawyers said they had found a 7,000-vote error in the 
results in Queens. And last week, Spargo said that the Vacco campaign 
had obtained material indicating that 1,000 people had voted in the 
names of people for whom death benefits were being paid by the Social 
Security Administration. But at the court hearing Monday, Spargo said 
the campaign was satisfied that the count had been accurate so far 
and that the Vacco campaign accepted the results as compiled by the 
State Board of Elections, indicating that Spitzer had a lead of 21,415 
votes. Of the claims that ballots had been cast in the names of dead 
voters, Spargo said that the Vacco campaign had found ``a significant 
number of irregularities.'' But he added that ``in certain cases, 
because of a lack of a date of birth in the Board of Elections records 
and people being in the same household with the same name, we didn't 
always have the most accurate information.'' With each of Vacco's 
accusations, Democratic leaders have in turn accused the Republican 
attorney general of engaging in tactics intended to stall the outcome 
of the election. They have harshly criticized Vacco, all but accusing 
the state's top lawyer of participating in hoaxes to delay the final 
count from being tabulated. Martin Connor, the minority leader of 
the state Senate and a lawyer for Spitzer's campaign, said it was 
time for Vacco to formally concede. ``It's time for Attorney General 
Vacco and the leadership of the Republican State Party to take off 
the earmuffs and listen to that stout lady singing,'' Connor said. 
``Because she's singing right now.'' At the same time, Connor denounced 
Vacco's accusations of voter irregularities. ``In this court case, 
neither the attorneys for Spitzer nor the court has been presented 
with one specific name by the Republican lawyers of a dead person 
who voted,'' Connor said. ``They've never submitted a list of particulars. 
What dead people?''
