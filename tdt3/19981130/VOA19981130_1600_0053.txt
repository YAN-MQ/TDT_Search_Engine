President Clinton is urging increased financial support for the Palestinians 
to keep the peace process with Israel alive. He spoke to a meeting 
of 45 donor nations in Washington. Mr. Clinton said he hopes the conference 
will send a clear signal that the peace accords are more than a peace 
of paper. We must look at Gaza and the West Bank in a new light, not 
as battle grounds but as energetic places at the crossroads of the 
Middle East, endowed with well-educated populations, strongly supported 
by the Palestinian community around the world, ripe for further development 
once investors see that the peace agreement truly is taking hold. 
Before the conference, President Clinton met Palestinian leader Yasir 
Arafat at the White House to review the status of the Wye River interim 
accord signed in October.
