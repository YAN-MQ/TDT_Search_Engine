The Russian government canceled plans Monday to discuss the 1999 budget, 
once again delaying efforts to come up with plans to tackle the country's 
economic crisis. A government spokesman said the Cabinet meeting on 
the budget had been rescheduled for Thursday, but gave no details. 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government has yet to produce firm 
plans to tackle the financial crisis since Russia effectively defaulted 
on some debts in August and devalued the currency. Primakov's government 
has requested more aid from the International Monetary Fund, warning 
Russia faces serious problems unless it gets more funding. But the 
IMF and Western governments say they won't provide any act until Russia 
adopts a realistic budget. Primakov will hold a series of meetings 
this week in Moscow with visiting IMF chief Michel Camdessus, who 
will be in Russia to discuss the government's efforts to deal with 
the economic situation. Russia's finance minister repeated pleas Sunday 
for IMF assistance. ``Money is not the main thing we need from the 
IMF, although we need that too,'' Mikhail Zadornov said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. ``We, above all, expect understanding 
from the IMF, and a program to relieve Russia's debt _ that is, dlrs 
17.5 billion.'' Russia has been hoping the IMF would release the next 
installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package that was frozen in 
August after the crisis erupted. Zadornov said he hoped the IMF would 
not only release the next loan installment, but help Russia restructure 
its foreign debt _ and perhaps persuade some creditors to let Russia 
off the hook. ``Without the consent of the IMF, creditors won't agree 
to defer, or possibly partly write off, Russia's external debt,'' 
Zadornov said. Another government financial officer, Alexander Pochinok, 
was quoted as saying Sunday that a 1999 draft budget assumes that 
Russia will receive the remaining dlrs 17.5 billion in loans from 
the IMF, World Bank and Japan.
