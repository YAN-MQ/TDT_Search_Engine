Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." Trying to become a contender 
in only their second year of existence, the arizona diamondbacks have 
made Randy Johnson one of the richest men in baseball, giving the 
prized free-agent pitcher a four-year deal worth $53 million. The 
diamondbacks now have six veteran starters in Johnson, Andy benes, 
Todd stottlemyre, Brian Anderson, Omar daal and armando reynoso. This 
pitching rotation, our starting rotation is as formidable as anyone 
out there. And it may be as -- in the top two or three staffs in baseball 
today.
