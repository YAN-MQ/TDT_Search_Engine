There are four big companies in the news today, two very much concerned 
with the future and two being forced to confront the past. First, 
the past. America's two biggest carmakers, General Motors and Ford, 
today denied new accusations that they collaborated with the Nazis 
during the war. Here's ABC's John Martin. Reporte in a class action 
lawsuit which includes Elsa iwanowa, a Russian woman who says she 
was kidnapped in 1942 by German troops. She was separated from her 
family and she was put to work in this Ford plant the rest of the 
war. We were treated as animals. We had no names, only numbers. We 
were starving and it was freezing. Well before world war II began, 
say historians, General Motors and Ford officials, including Henry 
Ford, ingratiated themselves with hitler and Nazi Germany. The lawsuit 
says Ford retained control of and profits from its plant in cologne, 
even while it was making thousands of German army trucks. Ford's plant 
manager worked for two masters, Ford and Hitler. His effort was at 
the same time to make profits for the company and to serve war ends. 
But Ford denies that, insisting Nazis took complete control of the 
plant. They dictated what was going to be made, how it was going to 
be made, what the labor force looked like, the working conditions. 
Likewise today, General Motors emphatically denied helping Nazis. 
It said its Opel plant was "expropriated by the third reich and operated 
by the reich." Economic historian Simon reich, who lost family in 
the Holocaust and studied the German war industry, says there is no 
evidence of Ford control. Although Ford, like GM, tried everything 
it could to collaborate, it was not able to maintain control of its 
assets. Would you would you worries that her lawsuit will be rebuffed. 
They did not even want to talk to us. They gave us nothing, nothing 
except this pin, a pin for three years hard labor and starvation.
