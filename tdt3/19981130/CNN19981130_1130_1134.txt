That's "Dollars & Sense." We'll be back with more bhis headlines in 
30 minutes. "Headline Sports" is next. Good boy, Simon. When your 
dog is the star of a syndicated comic strip, you get lots of fan mail. 
OK, Simon gets most of it. When we ran the strip where Simon snubs 
his food, people sent all kinds of dog food. I read the labels, and 
in every bag of Purina one brand beef and rice formula, beef is the 
number one ingredient. In lots of designer dog foods, it's corn. So 
I let Simon try Purina one. I'd say it went over pretty well. Purina 
one.
