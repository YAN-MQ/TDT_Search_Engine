A Japanese court has rejected a lawsuit seeking compensation for Dutch 
prisoners of war who were maltreated by Japanese troops during the 
second World War. The suit was a class action filed by eight people 
who claimed they were forced into slavery in Japanese prison camps 
in the former Dutch East Indies. The Tokyo district court ruled that 
individuals may not sue governments in wartime compensation cases, 
but it did acknowledge Japanese soldiers had violated human rights.
