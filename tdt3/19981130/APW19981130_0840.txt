Former England coach Terry Venables was cleared of any wrongdoing 
Monday in the signing of three Australian players at English first 
division side Portsmouth. Police said they found no evidence of dishonesty 
or corrupt behavior in the transfers that took place when Venables 
was in charge at Portsmouth. An investigation had been launched into 
the purchase of three Australians _ reported to be Robert Enes, Hamilton 
Thorpe and Craig Foster _ who had played under Venables when he was 
coach of the Australian national team. A police statement said, ``Hampshire 
Constabulary's fraud squad has completed its evaluation of paperwork 
and information concerning the transfer of three Australian players 
to Portsmouth Football Club last season. ``We have found no evidence 
of dishonest or corrupt practice of any person involved in those transfers 
and that investigation is now closed.'' Police, however, said they 
were continuing to investigate other allegations of ``bad business 
practice'' by the new board of directors at the club. Venables bought 
Portsmouth in August, 1996. He moved to another First Division club, 
Crystal Palace, this year.
