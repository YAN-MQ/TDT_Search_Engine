Djibouti's President Hassan Gouled Aptidon flew to Libya Monday for 
talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Libyan radio reported. Aptidon's 
arrival in Libya follows visits by the presidents of Gambia and Congo 
and by Louis Farrakhan, head of the U.S. Nation of Islam. All three 
flew into Libya, apparently breaking a U.N. flight ban on the north 
African state. A U.N. flight permission is required to fly to Libya 
and it was not clear if any of the four men had obtained them. Aptidon 
flew into Libya's coastal city of Sirte from Paris where he attended 
a French-African summit, said the radio report which was monitored 
by the British Broadcasting Corp. Libya was not invited to the summit 
because of the 1992 U.N. embargo. The embargo was imposed to force 
Libya hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing 
of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people. 
African countries voted in June to ignore the flight ban on Libya. 
Since then, several African leaders have defied the ban and flown 
to Libya. On Sunday, Congolese President Laurent Kabila arrived in 
Sirte from Paris to brief Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on the Paris 
summit, Libyan radio said. Also Sunday, Gadhafi awarded Gambian President 
Yahya Jammeh the Bravery medal for ignoring the sanctions. Gadhafi 
praised the African leaders for what he called an ``honorable'' stand 
for breaking the sanctions. He chided Arab leaders for not following 
suit.
