When Spinning first reached health clubs a few years ago, it was an 
instant hit with gym-goers. The International Health Racquet and Sportsclub 
Association estimates that nearly 46 percent of gyms now offer group 
cycling classes. The success of Spinning has spawned a new concept 
in exercise: Group classes are moving out of the aerobics studio and 
onto the cardiovascular machines found on the gym floor. Treadmill 
classes in particular are beginning to appear on aerobics schedules 
all across the country. Ellen Abbott, director of walking and running 
programs at the Boston Athletic Club, started ``Treading'' classes 
three years ago in response to members' comments about the tedium 
of working out alone on the treadmill. (She has since trademarked 
the concept.) In these classes, 25 or more people gather for guided 
jaunts in one area of the gym floor. Workouts involve climbing up 
inclines and sprinting toward imaginary finish lines while Ms. Abbott 
barks out instructions and encouragement. Nancy Marchal, a private 
investor who is one of Ms. Abbott's students, sees Treading as a great 
equalizer. ``A world class runner can be beside a beginning walker 
following the same basic program but working at different speeds'' 
she said, noting that this inspires students to push each other _ 
and themselves _ harder. When Ms. Abbott presented Treading at the 
recent World International Dance Exercise Association conference in 
Anaheim, Calif., it caused a sensation among exercise instructors. 
Other similar programs soon followed. StarTrac Treadmill's Trekking 
program was rolled out, as was High Energy Aerobic Training, which 
licenses programs to health clubs. Manufacturers of stair climbers, 
recumbent cycles and other types of cardiovascular machines are now 
considering the possibility of creating group programming centered 
around their equipment. Concept II, a company that sells stationary 
rowing machines, recently started Boat House, an organized rowing 
class, which is an evolution of the worldwide indoor rowing regattas 
held for years. Maeve McCaffery, of the sportsclub association, said 
these classes offer the camaraderie and energy of an aerobics class 
minus the confusing choreography. ``They appeal to people who would 
never set foot in low-impact aerobics because they would have to think 
too much,'' she said. ``They also generate a lot of buzz by adding 
pizazz to the same old activity.'' Although Julie McNeney, of the 
dance-exercise association, sees equipment-driven classes as an exciting 
new wave in fitness, she cautions that it translates better with some 
machines than with others. ``The skill level that is required to row 
properly is higher than what you need to walk on a treadmill or pedal 
a studio cycle,'' she said. ``Therefore, exercisers may get hurt before 
the learning curve kicks in.'' Some experts believe there is a tendency 
for students to push harder than usual, which may cause frequent participants 
to burn out and develop overuse injuries. They caution exercisers 
to start slowly with no more than one or two classes a week. Although 
some health clubs in New York City feature equipment classes beyond 
Spinning, they are less popular than in other areas because the clubs 
often do not have enough room for this space-gobbling activity. Some 
limit the number of students or schedule classes only during off hours. 
``Our treadmill classes sometimes interfere with people who don't 
want to join in,'' said Terry Certain, who manages a corporate fitness 
center for Scholastic Inc. in Manhattan. ``But they are very popular.''
