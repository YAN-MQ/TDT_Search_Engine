Partners at two prominent New York law firms _ White &AMP; Case and 
Brown &AMP; Wood _ are discussing merging their practices to create 
a law firm that would be among the nation's 10 largest. Duane Wall, 
a partner at White &AMP; Case who serves on the firm's management 
committee, confirmed that the firms were talking, but he called the 
discussions ``preliminary.'' Partners at Brown &AMP; Wood could not 
immediately be reached for comment. If a merger is ultimately approved, 
the two firms would become the largest to combine at a time when many 
have been scrambling to find partners. Firms say they need to be larger 
and have offices in cities throughout the world to better serve their 
multinational clients, who are merging themselves. ``If Citibank is 
not big enough to compete in the global economy, it's hard to see 
how a law firm of 200 or 300 lawyers can have positive long-term prospects,'' 
said Jonathan Lindsey, a recruiter in Manhattan for the legal search 
firm Major, Hagen &AMP; Africa. According to a recent survey by The 
National Law Journal, White &AMP; Case is the nation's seventh-largest 
firm, with 848 lawyers, while Brown &AMP; Wood ranked 71st, with 366 
lawyers. And according to The American Lawyer magazine, the average 
compensation for each partner at White &AMP; Case in 1997 was $605,000. 
In comparison, the average partner at Brown &AMP; Wood earned $490,000. 
Talk of a possible merger has spawned discussions in Manhattan's legal 
circles of new names for the combination. ``I suggested the name could 
be ``Beige &AMP; Wood'' or ``Tan &AMP; Wood,'' Lindsey said, ``but 
it doesn't seem to have caught on.''
