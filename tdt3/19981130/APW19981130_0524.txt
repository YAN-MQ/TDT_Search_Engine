The Russian government canceled plans Monday to discuss the 1999 budget, 
once again delaying efforts to come up with plans to tackle the country's 
economic crisis. A government spokesman said the Cabinet meeting on 
the budget had been rescheduled for Thursday, but gave no details. 
Several hours after that, officials said the government would only 
consider it after 10 days. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government 
has yet to produce firm plans to tackle the financial crisis since 
Russia effectively defaulted on some debts in August and devalued 
the currency. Primakov's government has requested more aid from the 
International Monetary Fund, warning Russia faces serious problems 
unless it gets more funding. But the IMF and Western governments say 
they won't provide any cash until Russia adopts a realistic budget. 
Primakov will hold a series of meetings this week in Moscow with visiting 
IMF chief Michel Camdessus, who is coming to Russia to discuss the 
government's efforts to deal with the economic situation. Russia's 
finance minister repeated pleas Sunday for IMF assistance. ``Money 
is not the main thing we need from the IMF, although we need that 
too,'' Mikhail Zadornov said, according to the Interfax news agency. 
``We, above all, expect understanding from the IMF, and a program 
to relieve Russia's debt _ that is, dlrs 17.5 billion.'' Russia has 
been hoping the IMF would release the next installment of a dlrs 22.6 
billion loan package that was frozen in August after the crisis erupted. 
Zadornov said he hoped the IMF would not only release the next loan 
installment, but help Russia restructure its foreign debt _ and perhaps 
persuade some creditors to let Russia off the hook. ``Without the 
consent of the IMF, creditors won't agree to defer, or possibly partly 
write off, Russia's external debt,'' Zadornov said. Another government 
financial officer, Alexander Pochinok, was quoted as saying Sunday 
that a 1999 draft budget assumes that Russia will receive the remaining 
dlrs 17.5 billion from the 22.6 billion bailout package from the IMF, 
World Bank and Japan _ logic criticized by the IMF mission that visited 
Moscow earlier this month. The IMF assailed the 1999 budget revenue 
forecast as too optimistic and criticized the government's plan to 
lower some taxes and offer support to ailing industries. First Deputy 
Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov told reporters Monday that the government 
would need several days to finalize tax changes and therefore couldn't 
complete the new draft this week. Maslyukov said the Cabinet would 
likely debate the budget Dec. 10, the Interfax reported. Meanwhile, 
the Agriculture Ministry said on Monday that this year's grain harvest 
of 51.5 million metric tons _ the worst in 45 years _ has left Russia's 
grain reserves 7 million tons short of this year's demand of 79.6 
million tons.
