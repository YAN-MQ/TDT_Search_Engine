This is how confident the Denver Broncos are. Cornerback Darrien Gordon 
was San Diego's No. 1 draft pick in 1993 and spent four years with 
the Chargers before signing with the Broncos as a free agent. He came 
home on Sunday, and in one of the best single-game performances by 
a defensive back this season, he had three tackles, two interceptions, 
three passes knocked down and one fumble recovery. Most players would 
take the shy role after the game, playing down their performance, 
not wanting to attract attention to themselves. Gordon did the opposite, 
maybe because, deep down, he knows this team is unstoppable and it 
really does not matter what he says. ``This is my house,'' Gordon 
said, pointing to the Chargers' Qualcomm Stadium. ``I built this house.'' 
Coach Mike Shanahan usually scripts Denver's opening 12 to 15 offensive 
plays. On the Broncos' first possession in their 31-16 bashing of 
the Chargers, quarterback John Elway fumbled the snap. The turnover 
was converted into a San Diego field goal. The Chargers had momentum. 
The record crowd of 66,523 was on its feet. The stomach of most coaches 
might tighten up in a knot and those scripted plays would be tossed 
into the garbage. But Shanahan kept his cool. He stuck to the script. 
Next possession, Ed McCaffrey had a 15-yard touchdown catch. The possession 
after that, McCaffrey had a 37-yard touchdown catch. Denver took back 
control of the game. ``Mike never loses his head,'' Broncos defensive 
end Neil Smith said. ``That's the biggest reason why we're 12-0.'' 
Twelve victories, no losses and, with four regular-season games to 
play, history is knocking at the door. But if Denver goes on to win 
all its remaining games, will the Chargers game, one of the ugliest 
of the year, hurt the Broncos' chances for being considered the greatest 
team ever? One view is that the Broncos are so good, they were able 
to overcome a first half in which Elway threw three interceptions 
and the Chargers outgained the Broncos in total offense, 194 yards 
to 152. ``Did you see every game the Dolphins played?'' Pat Bowlen, 
the Broncos owner, asked, referring to the 1972 Miami team that went 
undefeated. ``If at the end of the year we're 19-0, there's no reason 
you wouldn't consider this team one of the better teams in history, 
if not the greatest. You can't take a game like we played tonight 
and hold that up as evidence that they're not. All great teams have 
bad games, but they find a way to win.'' Chargers Coach June Jones 
said: ``I believe they are a very good football team. Maybe as good 
as I've looked at offensively in the 20 years I've been around the 
league.'' The other view is that professional football has become 
so diluted, with 31 teams, that any potential Denver claim to being 
the best will be weakened. The Chargers, who missed at least six starters 
because of injuries, are composed of some players who only months 
ago were playing football in Europe. They started a quarterback in 
Craig Whelihan who was 0-7 as a starter last season, and they still 
outgained Denver, 367 yards to 322, and limited running back Terrell 
Davis to 74 yards on 24 carries. ``They're beatable,'' said Whelihan, 
whose five interceptions were the most by a Chargers quarterback since 
Dan Fouts threw five in 1986 against the Giants. ``They're definitely 
beatable. I wish we played them again.'' The Chargers may have had 
the best chance to knock off Denver because the Broncos were not at 
their best. ``This was the night to beat them,'' Chargers General 
Manager Bobby Beathard said. Denver has games at home against Kansas 
City, at the Giants, at Miami and at home against Seattle. The only 
team with a winning record remaining on the Broncos' schedule are 
the 8-4 Dolphins. None of those teams have the offensive firepower 
to keep up with the Broncos, who have outscored opponents in the first 
quarter, 131-23, and have a variety of weapons. If Elway is having 
a bad day, he can hand the ball off to Davis. If Davis is slowed, 
Elway can look for tight end Shannon Sharpe. If Sharpe is covered, 
there are wide receivers McCaffrey and Rod Smith, two Pro Bowl players. 
``The Broncos were very good,'' Chargers defensive back Charles Dimry 
said. ``I think they'll go 16-0 to close out the regular season.''
