Spurred by competition from the Continent, about 50 of the 1,500 traders 
on London's futures markets hung up their bright-colored blazers Monday 
and turned to computer screens, abandoning open-outcry trading in 
favor of electronic dealing. For the London International Financial 
Futures Exchange, the switch came as an acknowledgment that it had 
fallen behind electronic rivals, particularly in Frankfurt, who captured 
the benchmark German bond contract this year, displacing London as 
the unchallenged leader of Europe's derivatives markets. Caroline 
Denton, a spokeswoman for the exchange, said the intention was to 
transfer the bulk of the exchange's business to electronic screen 
trading by next July. About 1,500 people work in the exchange's open-outcry 
pits, but more than 200 of them have been retrained to operate trading 
screens in the offices of the exchange's 212 members. Ms. Denton said 
47 member companies took part in trading 75 equity options Monday, 
and 11,600 contracts were traded. Some traders said the real test 
would come with busier trading. Ms. Denton said the volume Monday 
was average for equity options and that the changeover had worked 
well. The challenge to the London exchange is driven by the planned 
introduction of Europe's single currency, the euro, on Jan. 1. The 
currency change has galvanized European financial markets into cross-border 
deals to strengthen their positions and compete for business in the 
11-nation euro zone. This year, the futures markets in Frankfurt and 
Zurich set up a joint exchange called Eurex in direct opposition to 
the London exchange, just as the stock markets in London and Frankfurt 
formed what they called a ``strategic alliance'' as the core of a 
putative pan-European equities market. In a further acknowledgment 
that the insurgents are gaining ground, the London exchange also announced 
Monday that starting this month it would use two competing euro interest 
rates as a reference for euro futures contracts _ the Euribor, which 
is calculated by 57 mostly European banks, and the euro Libor, which 
is based on daily quotes from 16 international banks. Traders said 
it was unclear which rate would be most commonly used and how much 
they would differ from each other.
