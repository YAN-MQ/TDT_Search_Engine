Starting today, gun purchases won't take as long, but they may be 
more complicated. A new national system provides instant background 
checks on all gun purchases, including rifles and shotguns. That means 
the usual number of checks will double to an estimated 12.4 million 
per year. On average, that many firearms are sold each year in the 
U.S. Sarah Brady, who helped implement the five-day waiting period 
that this system replaces, says the new method has its faults. Mental 
health records, for many of the states, are not going to be on the 
national system. Restraining orders, misdemeanors involving domestic 
abuse -- those folks are prohibited from purchasing a gun. They're 
going to fall through the cracks, and this is not a time when we have 
seen such a wonderful reduction in violence with guns to be able to 
allow these loopholes to continue. We must tighten up these loopholes. 
Officials say they may have problems implementing the system, because 
december is the busiest month of the year for gun sales.
