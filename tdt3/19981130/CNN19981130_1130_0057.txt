Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's trip to the U.S. has already been 
financially successful. Palestinians will see a $400 million increase 
in U.S. aid, pending congressional approval. The announcement came 
just before Arafat's meeting with President Clinton this morning. 
Arafat is in Washington for a one-day conference designed to boost 
economic assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. The increase in U.S. 
aid is expected to prod contributions from the 40 other nations at 
the conference. The president said the aid will help stabilize the 
region and encourage peace. Today our purpose is to send a clear signal, 
that this peace is more than a Piece of paper, that the promise imagined 
at Oslo can become a concrete reality. A true peace, a growing peace, 
good for Palestinians, good for Israelis, good for the region and 
the world. Arafat has claimed he will declare Palestinian statehood 
next year. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised he'll 
walk away from the Middle East peace process if Arafat follows with 
the declaration.
