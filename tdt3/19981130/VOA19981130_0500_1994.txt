Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat has arrived in Washington seeking 
economic aid. And he says he intends to go ahead with plans to declare 
an independent Palestinian state next May, with East Jerusalem as 
its capitol. But as VOA's Chalice McGunnah reports, Mr. Arafat promises 
not to divide the city which Israel also claims as its historic capitol. 
Palestinian authority, President Yasir Arafat has once again said 
he wants to declare a Palestinian state when its five year interim 
period of self-government ends next year. The five-year period began 
under terms of the 1993 Oslo Peace Agreement between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. On the fourth of May, 1999, the 
interim period will end, and we should, by that time be prepared to 
declare our independent Palestinian state. And its capitol, Jerusalem, 
the Holy City. The Palestinian leader said Israel could have its capitol 
in West Jerusalem, a statement apparently aimed at stemming Israeli 
anger over his claim to the disputed city. He said, East Jerusalem 
would respect all of the religions that consider the city holy. We're 
not going to erect a Berlin Wall between the two parts of Jerusalem. 
Based on the principles of peace, and the spirit of peace, the two 
parts of Jerusalem ought to be open to each other. Mr. Arafat has 
long vowed to declare a Palestinian state when the interim period 
is over, whether there is progress in the peace process with Israel 
or not. But last week tensions grew after Israel accused the Palestinian 
leader of calling for renewed violence if Israel delays implementing 
a new peace agreement. At the same time, Israeli settlers have sparked 
Palestinian protests by grabbing more land in the West Bank. The settlers 
are responding to a call by Israel Foreign Minister Ariel Sharron 
to expand Israeli territory before it can be claimed by the Palestinians. 
Mr. Arafat also urged the audience to join in him for a yearlong celebration 
in Bethlehem to ring in the new Millennium. He says he looks forward 
to a new Middle East, in which all children could live together in 
peace, freedom, safety and security. Chalice McGunnah, VOA News, Washington. 
Mr. Arafat, incidentally, meets later today with President Clinton 
at the White House.
