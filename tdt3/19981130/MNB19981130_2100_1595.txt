We go to meteorologist Janice huff of WNBC-TV in New York City. There 
were prediction ths would be one of the worst years on record. And 
possibly next hurricane season could be just as bad as this one or 
worse. Me will tell. In the meantime, Nicole tirns to spin, now moving 
toward the group of islands be longing to Portugal. That's the only 
place it is threatening. It is expected to weaken. Winds of 75 miles 
per hour on this last day of the hurricane season. We still have activity 
in the atlantic. In the meantime, on the 48 states, we see a storm 
system rolling through the Great Lakes of the Ohio valley with rain 
over Michigan, thunderstorms through Ohio and Kentucky. It is snowing 
once again over the Sierra and parts of Oregon and Washington due 
to another powerful storm system. It's 56 degrees in San Francisco. 
They're seeing rain there. Temperatures remain warm across the gulf 
coast states into Florida tonight. Chilly in New England. Chilly near 
the Canadian border. Minnesota and North Dakota and 20's over the 
mountain regions. Tomorrow high temperatures, not that bad at all 
for this time of year. Coldest spot across Minnesota. 70's and 80's 
across the southern states. Plains warmer than usual once again. Denver, 
63 tomorrow. Chicago, 52. Minneapolis 47. Rain for Los Angeles. Sunshine 
in Miami with 80. 62 in Boston. Mild weather continues from New York 
City tomorrow all the way across the south back into Texas. That will 
continue into Thursday. No major changes except for rain moving into 
the central plains and more storms for the northwest and northern 
Rockies. That's the weather around the nation, Brian. Back to you.
