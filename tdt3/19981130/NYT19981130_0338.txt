Two pointed, moving new documentaries share one inarguable premise: 
No one on the outside can know what it's like to live with HIV, the 
AIDS virus. So these programs shrewdly allow people with HIV to tell 
their stories without narrative interference. That the speakers are 
children and young adults, fitting no one's stereotype of a person 
with AIDS, makes their comments all the more enlightening. ``Friends 
for Life: Living With AIDS'' is the Disney Channel's lucid program 
about children with HIV. Directed by Barbara Kopple (who made the 
classic ``Harlan County U.S.A.'' and the recent ``Wild Man Blues'' 
about a Woody Allen jazz tour), it means to spur discussion between 
parents and children. ``It Could Be You,'' Tuesday's episode of MTV's 
``True Life'' series, is made by two women in their 20s who got the 
virus while in their teens. Being shown on World AIDS Day, these unrelated 
programs have other stirring elements in common. Both are effective 
as personal drama rather than raw information. The people profiled 
are thoughtful, healthy and average-looking, though they depend on 
more medications than a viewer can count. And the programs' tone is 
not tear-jerking but reflects the toughness that coping with AIDS 
requires day after day. ``Friends for Life'' may seem an unusual project 
for the cheery Disney Channel, but its positive approach is familiar, 
showing that children with HIV are just as playful and hopeful as 
their schoolmates, with an even more extreme need for friends. Much 
of the program focuses on Chris Edwards. An 11-year-old with a baseball 
cap on backward, he climbs a jungle gym and stops to tell the camera: 
``I enjoy climbing and dirt-bike riding and wrestling. I like just 
doing what a regular kid would like.'' To other children, this makes 
the point that he can be a friend; to an adult, his assumption that 
he is not ``a regular kid'' is among the heart-wrenching details. 
These children often parrot adults and sound too old for their years, 
with a sad mix of adult cares and childish emotions. ``I was born 
with HIV,'' Chris says. ``I want to keep it a secret because I'm afraid 
if I tell everybody, they'll turn against me and be mad.'' There are 
scenes of boys and girls white-water rafting, and at a camp for children 
with HIV. (The program rarely distinguishes between those carrying 
the HIV virus and those who actually have AIDS.) Throughout, their 
major theme is the isolation of living with a condition that often 
makes them outcasts. Though the emphasis is on living, the program 
can't avoid the subject of death. Stephanie, 12, says that when she 
gets depressed, she reminds herself she's still alive. When Chris 
gives a talk at a school, he is asked by another child, ``What's the 
scariest part about having AIDS?'' He ticks off his answers: ``Let's 
see. Dying, afraid someone's going to bomb your house if you tell, 
and losing friends.'' The program's weakness is that it includes so 
little information about what HIV is and how it is transmitted, largely 
throwing parents back on their own resources. But then its purpose 
is to start a conversation between parents and children who are ready 
to deal with the issue, not be a substitute for one. MTV's program 
has a more cautionary and harrowing tone. For its teen-agers and young 
adults, the determination to have long lives coexists with the harsh 
knowledge of what they're up against. Most of the people profiled 
by the filmmakers, Jennifer Jako and Rebecca Guberman, were also infected 
as teen-agers, often through a blase attitude about sex and drugs. 
They do not beat themselves up about it here, but go on to explain 
how their lives have changed forever. With a more stylized approach, 
``It Could Be You'' occasionally flashes statistics about HIV on screen 
against a red background of blood seen under a microscope. ``Every 
hour, two Americans under the age of 20 become infected with HIV,'' 
is one, reflecting the young men and women's sense of astonishment 
that this has happened to them. ``I thought HIV only happened to gay 
men and people who used drugs,'' says Ms. Jako, who got the virus 
from unprotected sex. A woman named Jasmine, who got the virus from 
her only sexual partner when she was 13, five years ago, still finds 
her situation hard to accept. One especially alarming statistic notes: 
``A recent survey of HIV-infected people says 40 percent had not told 
their status to their sexual partners.'' Despite their more mature 
attitude, the people on the MTV special echo the emotional themes 
of the children on the Disney Channel. They are saddened by people 
who are afraid to touch them, and fear never finding anyone who will 
love them. Neither of these half-hour specials says what percentage 
of people with HIV are children or young adults. Focusing instead 
on the need to tell their stories, these programs constitute eloquent 
pleas for understanding. PRODUCTION NOTES: `FRIENDS FOR LIFE' Living
