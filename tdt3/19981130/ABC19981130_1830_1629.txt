Confirming the conservationists worst suspicions. In several countries 
of the far east, they are trying to determine the status of the Asian 
Tiger. In Thailand, they put cameras in the tigers' jungle habitat, 
designed to record their movement. The cameras are programmed to photograph 
anything that trips these infrared beams of light. We don't have to 
watch the tigers. We do not have to disturb them. We don't have to 
disturb their habitats. But guess what showed up? When the survey 
was over, there were more poachers than tigers on film. Poachers who 
take them alive for zoos and others who kill them for their skins 
and their organs. Aphrodisiacs, you know. We've found that there are 
far fewer tigers than we'd ever thought out there in those forests 
and that's an alarm bell for us. It means the tigers are on their 
way out. The Asian Tiger population has declined by 95% in the last 
100 years. In Thailand, this survey found only six.
