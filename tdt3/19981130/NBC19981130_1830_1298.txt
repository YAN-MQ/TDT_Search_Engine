Now "living better" and a medical problem that everyone should be 
aware of, oes owe pro sis, bone loss that can cause all kinds of problems. 
The study out tonight raises new questions about treatment of this 
preventable disease. We get more now from Robert Bazell. Women seldom 
feel the first stages of the potentially devastating bone loss called 
osteoporosis. And the study out today finds that an alarming number 
are not even talking to their doctor about it. Osteoporosis is called 
"the silent disease" because the process of bone loss occurs without 
any symptoms at all. According to the latest study from UCLA, almost 
40% of women over 45 never discuss osteoporosis with their physician, 
and fully 2% do not know that collapsing bones in the spine, called 
compression fractures, are the most common consequence. In fact, osteoporosis 
leads to 700,000 spinal fractures, 300,000 hip fractures and 200,000 
wrist fractures every year. How many of you know about osteoporosis? 
Dr. saralyn Mark is on a crusade to prevent osteoporosis. She sends 
her message not just to older women but to younger groups, like college 
students. What I've tried to do is educate young women and girls that 
they have the tools to make healthy life choices. Like taking 1,200 
milligrams of calcium a day, exercising and avoiding smoking. Choices 
saralyn made only when her own mother was diagnosed with osteoporosis 
after breaking her back and suffering terrible pain. It brought tears 
to my eyes when I would have to sit. Experts say women of all ages 
should be taking calcium and exercising if possible. For older women, 
new drugs can now treat osteoporosis. New guidelines say that all 
women should get bone density tests at age 65, even younger if they 
have a family history of osteoporosis. If a woman's bones are thinning, 
she can take several drugs to stop and even reverse the process. Osteoporosis, 
once thought to be an inevitable consequence of growing old, can now 
prevented if woman start paying attention in their early years and 
treated when it strikes in later life. Robert Bazell, NBC news, New
