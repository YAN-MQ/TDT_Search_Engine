night, time for our regular first of the week look at the three big 
newsweeklies. There is a trend forming. "U.S. news" shows Santa shopping 
on the web. "Newsweek," Martha Stewart, Christmas goes on-line. Have 
you tried stores? They're amazing. They have merchandise inside of 
them. "Time," 100 builders and titans. A lot of controversy over their 
decision on the 100 people who shaped the century. It is a thoroughly 
American century as Harry Evans pointed out. Inside "U.S. news" -- 
Inside "Newsweek" -- Inside "time" -- That wraps up our look at the 
newsweeklies this Monday night. More ahead as we continue in our next 
half-hour, including the casualties of the Clinton-star battle from 
"Dateline" NBC tonight. One person's account of what it was like to 
be caught in this cross fire. Plus, what it's like to be on the fast 
track. A huge loss in the pacific northwest, a major city has lost 
a major figure in its fight to educate its own. Nobody loves cars 
more than I do. Each one is a work of art. So when the maker of all 
of these chose a new antifreeze, it got my attention. General Motors 
now uses the dex-cool technology of havoline extended life antifreeze 
in virtually all its new vehicles. The same patented formula you can 
use in your car, for 5 years or 150,000 miles. So do what GM did, 
switch to havoline. I use it in my car. I only wish this were it. 
a thought for those of you married to your job. Every once in a while, 
have a fling... with your wife. Royal Caribbean. Like no vacation 
on earth.
