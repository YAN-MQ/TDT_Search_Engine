Lincoln Center's American Songbook, a new series that aspires to be 
the popular song equivalent of the successful Jazz at Lincoln Center 
series, has announced its opening programs. On Feb. 5 and 6, it will 
make its debut at Alice Tully Hall with ``I Gotta Right to Sing the 
Blues,'' a salute to Harold Arlen, the composer of the standards ``Stormy 
Weather'' and ``Come Rain or Come Shine'' as well the scores of the 
movies ``The Wizard of Oz'' and the 1954 ``Star Is Born.'' A month 
later, on March 5 and 6, the series will showcase the music of Richard 
Rodgers in a program called ``With a Song in My Heart.'' American 
Songbook, produced by Ira Weitzman and financed by Chivas Regal and 
the Irene Diamond Fund, is to continue in the fall of 1999 and spring 
of 2000 with four more programs. Each concert will be semi-staged 
with theatrical lighting, slide projections and full orchestral accompaniment. 
The disk jockey Jonathan Schwartz, the program's artistic director, 
will be the concerts' master of ceremonies. Like the jazz series, 
Lincoln Center's American Songbook will also include educational programs 
and workshops to introduce the music to younger audiences. Performers 
who are to participate in the Arlen program include Barbara Cook, 
Diana Krall, Jay Leonhart, Audra McDonald, Maureen McGovern, Richard 
Muenz, Ken Page and Mike Renzi. The Rodgers program is to feature 
Harolyn Blackwell, Ann Hampton Callaway, Michael Feinstein, Maria 
Friedman, Mary Cleere Haran, Leonhart, Mark Murphy, Faith Prince, 
Renzi and Wesla Whitfield. These performers belong to the series' 
informal repertory company that is also to include Jackie Cain, Rosemary 
Clooney, Vic Damone, Vinnie Falcone, Roy Kral, Andrea Marcovicci, 
Susannah McCorkle, Mandy Patinkin, John Pizzarelli, Linda Ronstadt 
Carol Sloane and Margaret Whiting. Each program will include symposiums 
built on each concert event, film presentation and other educational 
events. The first will be a documentary, ``Over the Rainbow: The Life 
and Music of Harold Arlen,'' directed by Don McGlynn, who has made 
many films profiling jazz legends. The movie features performances 
by singers closely related to Arlen, including Judy Garland (``Over 
the Rainbow''') and Lena Horne (``Stormy Weather'') along with clips 
of Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Mel Torme. The film will be shown 
in association with the Film Society of Lincoln Center at the Walter 
Reade Theater on Feb. 3 at 8:30 p.m. A free three-hour symposium featuring 
a panel of Arlen specialists and performers will be held at Walter 
Reade Theater on Feb. 6 at 10 a.m. ``In the same way that jazz found 
a home here at Lincoln Center through our series of Classical Jazz 
concerts, which grew into Jazz at Lincoln Center, so, too, shall America's 
greatest songwriters have a home at Lincoln Center with this new series,'' 
said Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center for the Performing 
Arts.
