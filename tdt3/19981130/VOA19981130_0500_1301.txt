The surging Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League skated 
to their 6th win in seven games thanks in large part to John McClare, 
and Eric Lindroff. McClare scored four goals, and Lindroff collected 
four assists to spark the Flyers to a 6-2 win over the Vancouver Kanuks. 
Tampa Bay lost its 8th straight game. This time a 6-3 loss to the 
Buffalo Sabers. Others in the win column: The New York Rangers, Detroit, 
Carolina, and Chicago.
