Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a short break. We however will be back with you in a couple of minutes 
for more of News Now. Today is Monday, November 30th is the date. 
1998 is the year. A couple of historical notes to bring up for things 
that occurred on this date. It was in 1835 that Samuel Langhorn Clemens 
was born. Of course we know Sam Clemens as Mark Twain, one of America's 
greatest humorists and writers, most notably you remember "Tom Sawyer" 
and "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn". Also on November 30th, in 
1782 the United States and Britain agreed on peace terms to end the 
American War for Independence. The draft treaty recognized the independence 
of the United States from England, and established the new nation's 
boundary with British Canada. The treaty also secured Americans' fisherman's 
rights of access to the Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland. 
And for its part, the United States agreed to use its power to end 
the persecution of loyalists by state and local governments here in 
the United States. It is coming up on 11 hours Universal Time. We 
are now going to say goodbye to listeners in the Americas until midnight 
Universal Time when VOA News Now resumes on 59.95, 613, 7405, 9455,9775, 
11695 and 13.74 megahertz. In East Asia VOA continues on 5985, 611,
