President Clinton met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the 
White House this morning. He announced the U.S. will increase aid 
to Palestinians by $400 million, pending congressional approval. Arafat 
is in Washington to attend a one-day conference designed to garner 
economic assistance for the West Bank and Gaza. The increase in U.S. 
aid is expected to prod contributions from the 40 other nations at 
the conference. The president says every step toward development in 
the disputed territories is a step towards peace and security. There 
must be greater investment of private resources in Gaza and the West 
Bank. Each vote of confidence makes the infrastructure a little stronger. 
Each investment makes previous investments more likely to succeed. 
It is good economic policy, and it's the right thing to do. Arafat 
has claimed he will declare Palestinian statehood next year. Israeli 
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised he'll walk away from the 
peace process if Arafat follows through.
