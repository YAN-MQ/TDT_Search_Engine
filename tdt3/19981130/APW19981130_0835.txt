Pilots of Lebanon's national airline said Monday they will delay flight 
departures from Beirut airport for three hours Tuesday to press demands 
for higher salaries and other benefits, a union statement said. The 
decision taken by the 170 pilots of the state-owned Middle East Airlines 
will affect six departing flights between midnight (2200GMT) Monday 
and midday (1000GMT) Tuesday. However, incoming MEA flights as well 
as flights of foreign airlines to and from Beirut International Airport 
will not be affected. The pilots are demanding among other things 
a salary increase of 2.5 percent that was awarded in 1996 but never 
paid and financial compensation for overtime. An MEA pilot earns an 
average of about dlrs 3,000 a month. MEA, which employs about 3,400 
people, is Lebanon's second biggest employer after the public sector. 
It has a fleet of nine aircraft. MEA incurred dlrs 100 million losses 
in the last few years, continuing a slide begun during the 1975-90 
civil war. The government bought a 99 percent stake in the company 
after debts owed to the Central Bank were converted into shares.
