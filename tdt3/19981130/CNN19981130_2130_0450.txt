This time, the IRS got the audit. The general accounting office released 
a study today involving visits to several IRS service centers nationwide 
during the peak filing period in april. Investigators found problems 
such as using unarmed bicycle couriers to deliver millions of dollars 
in taxpayer checks, and the hiring of some employees before background 
checks were complete. While the IRS commissioner "generally agreed" 
with the results. He says the agency already is working to stop security 
weaknesses.
