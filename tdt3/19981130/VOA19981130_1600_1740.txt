In Evanston, Illinois, Northwestern University has a problem with 
the artistic efforts of a student named Ryan Duval. The sophomore 
from Northern California has attempted to recreate Michelangelo's 
Sistine Chapel painting on the ceiling of his dormitory room at Northwestern. 
But University officials say the painting violates dormitory rules. 
Mr. Duval says since he's paying $6400 for room and board, he should 
be able to decorate his room the way he wants to. He was inspired 
by the real Sistine Chapel which he visited earlier this year.
