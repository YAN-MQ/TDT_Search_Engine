The waiting period is over for would-be gun owners. But they may face 
some new obstacles. Under the Brady law, prospective buyers had to 
wait five days to make their purchase. State and local police used 
that time to make background checks on people seeking to buy handguns. 
Now, a new national system of instant background checks takes over. 
But the system is expected to double the number of checks because 
it requires approval for the purchase of rifles and shotguns, not 
just handguns. Authorities expect some problems as they break in the 
new system. They say December is the busiest month for gun sales because 
hunting seasons coincide with holiday shopping.
