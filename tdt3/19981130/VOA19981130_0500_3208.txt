Well, if John Glenn can go back into space, why can't the Rolling 
Stones go out on tour, again. The Rolling Stones have announced the 
beginning of their 1999 tour to promote their latest live album "No 
Security". This will be the band's first arena tour in two decades. 
And it comes on the heals of the Stones just completed, "Bridges to 
Babylon" Tour. What's an arena tour? Well it means that the Stones 
will be playing arenas which seat about 10,000 people instead of those 
huge stadiums that they have been selling out for the past 20 years. 
The 1999 tour will open on January 25th in Oakland California. The 
first leg will wrap up on April 10th in Oklahoma City.
