Police fought an hour-long gun battle with drug smugglers in central 
Sudan, killing two and confiscating 1.5 tons of hashish, state television 
reported Sunday night. Police, acting on a tip, cornered seven smugglers 
near the town of Ed-Dueim, which is 190 kilometers (miles 120) south 
of the capital Khartoum, the television said. Two of the men were 
killed in the gun battle, but five fled and were being sought, it 
said. A police statement said the 1.5 tons of hashish _ the country's 
largest single drug seizure _ had a street value of more than a billion 
Sudanese pounds (about dlrs 500,000) and was destined for Khartoum 
for sale. It said police acted after receiving a tip about the drug 
shipment, which apparently originated in western Darfur state. ``This 
is one of our greatest achievements that came as a result of coordination 
among the various police departments,'' the police statement said.
