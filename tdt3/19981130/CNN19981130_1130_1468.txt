broke records in its first weekend of wide release, bringing in $46.5 
million over the five-day period. It's the biggest Thanksgiving movie 
ever for Disney. Coming in second was "the rugrats movie." The film 
with the characters from the nickelodeon TV show earned almost $28 
million. The rest of the top five included the will Smith thriller 
"enemy of the state," which came in third. The Adam Sandler comedy 
"the waterboy" took fourth. And opening in fifth place was "babe: 
pig in the city."
