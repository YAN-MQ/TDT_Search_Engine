Former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet has been told to 
leave the London hospital where he's been recovering from an operation. 
The clinic said he no longer requires their specialist's care. Meanwhile, 
Chile's foreign minister, Jose Miguel Insulsa, is in Madrid pressing 
his government's case to have the general tried in Chile. Daniel Shweinler 
has the details. The Chilean foreign minister, Jose Miguel Insulsa, 
has been trying to convince Spanish politicians that Chile and not 
Spain should be trying Augusto Pinochet for crimes committed during 
his 17 years as head of state. He said he understood the wishes of 
the victims to see justice done, but that Spain should not be interfering 
in the democratic process in Chile. Spanish politicians will tell 
Mr. Insulsa that this is a matter for the courts in which they will 
not interfere. This is Daniel Schweinler for the BBC in Madrid. The 
U.S. has spoken out for the first time about the Pinochet affair. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has suggested it should be up 
to Chileans to decide his fate. She said it was very difficult to 
balance justice with reconciliation for past abuses.
