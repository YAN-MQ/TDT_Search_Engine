A federal appeals court arrived at a Solomonic solution Monday in 
a legal challenge to the Giuliani administration's virtual shutdown 
of public access to City Hall, ruling that hundreds of demonstrators 
could hold a rally Tuesday in the parking area in front of City Hall 
but could not set foot on the building's 11 steps. The decision, by 
a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, 
left both sides publicly declaring partial victory. City officials 
said that the panel had largely ruled in their favor by reversing 
several aspects of a decision last week by a District Court judge 
and by not impinging on their right to assess the security needs for 
City Hall. ``They can come in the plaza but not go on the steps,'' 
Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said. ``And that's a 
major victory for the city.'' But spokesmen for Housing Works, an 
AIDS service organization that had sued the city over access to City 
Hall, said that by winning the right to step beyond the concrete barriers 
that surround the building, they had won. ``Our whole point was to 
be at City Hall to make this statement,'' Charles King, the group's 
co-director, said. ``If I'm standing one step in front of the steps, 
I'm going to consider this a victory.'' In its ruling, the court left 
unanswered its reasons for barring the demonstrators from City Hall's 
steps. Norman Siegel, the director of the New York Civil Liberties 
Union, which had argued the case for Housing Works, said he was disappointed 
with that part of the ruling. Siegel and representatives from Housing 
Works met Monday with city and police officials to work out the details 
for the rally, which will begin with a parade down Broadway from Houston 
Street and end with a news conference in the parking area, which is 
called City Hall Plaza. About 550 people are expected to attend. It 
marks the first event staged in front of City Hall by anyone other 
than the city since mid-August, when the Police Department launched 
Operation Bravo, a plan to tighten security in lower Manhattan.
