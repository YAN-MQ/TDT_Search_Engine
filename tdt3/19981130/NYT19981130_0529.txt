A day after ratifying a new three-year contract, teachers returned 
to work Monday at the city's 39 schools, with classes returning to 
normal after a five-day strike that had paralyzed the school system 
of 32,000 students. About 90 percent of the students were in class 
Monday, according to school officials, a notable difference from the 
30 percent or so who attended during the strike. High schools had 
been closed for four days, and elementary schools were in session 
only half days. A Superior Court judge had ordered the teachers back 
to work by Monday at the risk of losing their jobs. On Monday, teachers 
and administrators tried to get back to the business of education 
in a district that has been under state control for nine years because 
of poor performance. Administrators and teachers also said they had 
to begin the work of healing relations after a bitter dispute that 
pitted the teachers mostly against Richard DiPatri, the state-appointed 
superintendent. Teachers and students said that Monday was spent catching 
up on what was missed during the strike. Joanne Kenny, DiPatri's executive 
assistant, said the school year would probably not be extended to 
make up for the strike days. Several students said that they were 
glad to get back to classes, and that they had become bored sitting 
at home watching television or talking on the telephone. ``I missed 
my chemistry class because we were starting something real interesting, 
the periodic table,'' said Shante Brown, 16, who is in the 11th grade. 
At Public School 12 down the street, children said they were again 
working on real lessons, and not just sitting around coloring or playing 
on computers or watching videos as a handful of substitute teachers 
watched over them. At several schools, teachers reported that their 
principals brought in cakes and other pastries to welcome the teachers 
back, and others broadcast their welcome over the public address system. 
``Our principal told the students that they only had to remember what 
last week was like to see how important it was that we were there,'' 
said Janet Fegely, who teaches math at Public School 15.
