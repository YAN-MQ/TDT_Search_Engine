WASHINGTON _ ``No accused,'' President Clinton's lawyers wrote in 
September in response to perjury accusations leveled by Kenneth Starr, 
``has an obligation to help his accuser.'' That creed has guided Clinton 
this troublesome year as he has dodged questions from Paula Jones' 
lawyers, from Starr's prosecutors, and, now, from the House Judiciary 
Committee. The White House on Monday said that Clinton will decline 
the Judiciary Committee's invitation to appear before it to answer 
additional questions and to defend his actions. The president is under 
no obligation to help those who are trying to do him in, said Joe 
Lockhart, the White House press secretary. ``The president has answered 
the questions of the committee, he sat and answered the questions 
from the independent counsel. So I don't expect that you'll see the 
president any time in the near future talking to members of the committee,'' 
Lockhart said, explaining Clinton's refusal to appear. Clinton's written 
replies to the committee's 81 questions, delivered late Friday, were 
of a piece with the approach he has taken all year to the allegations 
in the Monica Lewinsky matter _ concede nothing, recall little, attack 
the accusers, play for time and use contrition as both a shield and 
a spear. All these tactics were on display in the president's 24-page 
response to the Judiciary Committee's questions and in White House 
comments on it. Clinton's advisers say that the panel was not looking 
for facts in the detailed questionnaire. Rather, they say, the Republican 
majority on the committee had handed Clinton a loaded gun and asked 
him to put it to his own head. The president and his lawyers said 
no dice. Except for matters of incontrovertible fact _ the dates of 
meetings, the times of telephone calls _ Clinton contested every allegation 
and disputed every witness against him. He would not even give a simple 
answer to the question of whether he was the nation's chief law enforcement 
officer, the committee's very first query. ``The President is frequently 
referred to as the chief law-enforcement officer, although nothing 
in the Constitution specifically designates the President as such,'' 
Clinton replied. ``Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution 
states that `[t)he executive power shall be vested in a President 
of the United States of America,' and the law-enforcement function 
is a component of the executive power.'' The answers to the remaining 
questions were similar in tone. There was no perjury, no witness tampering, 
no obstruction of justice, no abuse of power, Clinton repeatedly asserted. 
If the committee wanted to impeach him, he said, it should expect 
no help from him. And if Starr or his successors as independent counsel 
should chose to indict Clinton after he leaves office, they, too, 
can expect no cooperation. ``Literally true statements cannot be the 
basis for a perjury prosecution, even if a witness intends to mislead 
the questioner,'' Clinton's lawyers wrote in response to Starr's allegations 
of perjury in his impeachment referral to Congress in September. A 
senior White House aide said that Clinton was responding in the same 
spirit as the questions that were put to him all year. ``If you subject 
a president to a legal process,'' the aide said, ``no one should be 
surprised that you get legalistic answers.'' White House officials 
and the president's lawyers said that Clinton was not being obstructionist. 
They say they firmly believe that whatever else Clinton may be guilty 
of _ and they readily concede caddish behavior and misleading statements 
_ he is not guilty of impeachable or indictable offenses. They are 
far too sophisticated to fall into the Judiciary Committee's perjury 
trap, after having faced the same sorts of questions from Ms. Jones' 
lawyers in January and Starr's interrogators in August. So rather 
than devising new answers to old questions, they fell back on the 
old answers. The document submitted to the Judiciary Committee repeatedly 
refers back to responses given by the president in his August grand 
jury testimony and in his January deposition in the Jones lawsuit. 
And the president repeats, mantra-like, ``That testimony was not false 
or misleading.'' To concede otherwise would be to plead guilty to 
crimes with which the president has yet to be formally charged. Although 
Clinton refrains from imputing partisan motives to his questioners 
on the committee, his aides do not shy from doing so. ``They were 
determined to use this against us, no matter what the answers were,'' 
said one member of the president's legal team. ``Their game plan is 
to avoid the larger reality, which is they are lacking public support 
and lacking the proper standards for impeachment. Exercises such as 
this are part of their partisan plan.'' The president gave his Democratic 
defenders on the committee at least a little ammunition with which 
to defend him. He says repeatedly in his responses that he misled 
his aides and the nation about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky 
and that he has publicly apologized for it. But his contrition is 
a weapon as well, designed to remind the public of the private nature 
of his offenses and to bring shame upon his accusers for dragging 
him _ and the country _ through the muck. ``For me, this long ago 
ceased to be primarily a legal or political issue, and became instead 
a painful personal one,'' the president wrote in an introduction to 
his replies to the committee. ``I hope these answers will contribute 
to a speedy and fair resolution of this matter.''
