Many of us dread the trip to the dentist's office. But new advances 
in technology could make dentistry less painful and scary for children 
and adults. Dr. Steve Salvatore reports. Dentists now have new treatments 
for two major dental problems, tooth loss and cavities. These developments 
may make your next trip to the dentist a little easier. The leading 
cause of tooth loss in the United States is periodontal disease. It's 
an inflammation and destruction of tissues that surround and support 
the teeth, caused by bacteria and plaque that accumulate above and 
below the gum line. But now, a new medication, called periostat, can 
help fight this disease. When we use this drug in addition to scaling 
and root plaining, we show a 50% improvement in the outcome. We also 
have shown that we can prevent the progression of the disease in patients 
who are on the drug versus those who are on placebo. Studies show 
periodontal disease starts in early childhood and increases as we 
age. And there are a number of risk factors, like smoking, diabetes, 
diet, stress, genetic factors and poor oral hygiene. And poor hygiene 
can also lead to cavities. For many people, there's nothing worse 
than the pain of a dentist's drill. But now, there's a new laser that 
offers a pain-free solution for 98% of patients, and you won't hear 
this anymore. Just ask 12-year-old Rachel Owens. She had the laser 
procedure with no anesthesia. It just felt like tapping, and that 
was it. The new laser uses hydrokinetic technology. Where the power 
of the laser is mixed with a high precision water spray. Dr. Ed Romano 
uses the new laser in his practice. It causes the water to actually 
do the cutting. The laser does a little bit, but about 85% of it is 
done with regular water. The laser can be used on children and adults. 
And has some other benefits. It produces a sterile field as it cuts, 
which decreases tooth sensitivity. And creates a stronger bond than 
a traditional filling. And here's the best part -- My hope is that 
we will literally raise a generation of people who aren't afraid to 
go to the dentist. Because there's no needle and there's no drill. 
And that gives us all something to smile about. Dr. Steve Salvatore, 
CNN, New York.
