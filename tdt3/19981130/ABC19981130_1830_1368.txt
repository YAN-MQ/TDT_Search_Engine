The White House said today President Clinton is likely to turn down 
an invitation to testify before the committee next week. Chairman 
Henry Hyde blasted Mr. Clinton today for those 81 questions or rather 
for the president's answers to those 81 questions put to the president 
in the hope that he would clarify his position on the Monica lewinsky 
case. Mr. Hyde said instead of shedding new light on the key facts, 
the president chose to evade them. So how does this all affect the 
impeachment process? Here's ABC's Linda Douglass. The president's 
answers did not change any minds on the house judiciary committee, 
where members are dug in in partisan camps. Republicans called Mr. 
Clinton an unrepentant liar, while democrats argued there is still 
no proof that he has done anything impeachable. But in the house at 
large, some members are struggling to make up their minds about impeachment. 
When the house returns to vote later this month, just a handful of 
members may determine the outcome. One democrat says Mr. Clinton's 
legalistic answers are not making his own decision any easier. He 
just seemed incapable of answering the question by giving a straight 
answer to a reasonable question. Congressman Moran says he is deeply 
disappointed in the president, but not quite ready to see him impeached. 
Congressman Peter king, one of several republicans who plan to vote 
against impeachment, says the president's answers won't change his 
mind. "I'm disappointed, but not surprised. It is what we have come 
to expect." Democratic leaders now are crafting a tough censure resolution 
hoping to appeal to fence-sitting republicans and to democrats that 
don't want to let the president off the hook. They may not let to 
come to the floor for a vote, leaving members just one choice, to 
impeach or not. Linda Douglass, Capitol Hill.
