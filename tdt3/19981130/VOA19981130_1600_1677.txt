Well, it's that time of year again, and an American consumer group 
has issued its annual list of warnings about dangerous toys. This 
is a busy season for toy sales, as you might imagine, because of holiday 
gift giving. And the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, as it calls 
itself, wants the public to know about the hazards of what might seem 
at first to be harmless toys. First on its warning list is balloons. 
Consumer advocate Ed Merzwinsky explains that the group put balloons 
on the list because they can cause choking. He also warns against 
soft plastic toys made of poly vinyl chloride or PVC. He says tests 
show that they contain chemicals that can cause liver and kidney damage 
and possible cancer. Finally, Mr. Merzwinsky points out that if toys 
are too noisy, they can cause hearing loss. On this point, the Public 
Interest Research Group passes along a suggestion from the American 
Speech Language Hearing Association. If you hold a toy near your ear 
and the noise it makes hurts that ear, well, don't buy the toy.
