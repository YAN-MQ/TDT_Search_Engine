Well you know, for some people sleep walking is just about as good 
as a trip out into space. And over the years I've heard of a number 
of things that have happened to people when they were in that vulnerable 
state. Well, retiree James Curren has got a story that really takes 
the cake. He's from Palm Harbor Florida, and he wandered outside one 
night. He ended up in the pond in the back of his home, got stuck 
in the mud and the water, about a meter of it. And then some alligators 
noted. So, he had to beat the alligators off with his cane and it 
got to be a pretty sticky situation. He started yelling for help, 
and then the neighbors child ultimately called the police. But what 
I really want to know is, at what point in this ordeal did he exactly 
wake up?
