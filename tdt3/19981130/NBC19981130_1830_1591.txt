For some time now here on "NBC nightly news," we've been telling you 
about a remarkable man in Seattle, John Stanford, a retired general 
who decided his next battle would be reviving that city's public schools. 
Then, another unexpected battle for his life. He suffered from leukemia, 
but he would not give up. John Stanford died over the weekend, but 
as NBC's Mike Boettcher tells us, his life lives on in the city he 
loved. They came with Flowers. Children. Parents. Teachers. All for 
John Stanford, the former army general turned Seattle school superintendent. 
According to friends, a man who challenged them like a preacher challenges 
sinners to do good again. An incredibly great man. One of a kind. 
Cancer killed him at age 60. For seven months, he fought it with the 
same vigor he displayed in turning around Seattle's public schools. 
Six weeks ago when we visited him, it seemed that an experimental 
treatment was beating his leukemia. I never considered that I would 
not live. But as was his nature, he wouldn't talk much about himself. 
He wanted to talk about his kids -- the students. Children don't learn 
from people who do not love them. Seattle took a risk three years 
ago when it hired Stanford, a man with no education experience. But 
this former general came ready to wage war -- against apathetic teachers, 
underachieving students, complacent parents and an indifferent community. 
Test scores soon rose. Seattle was becoming proud of its schools again. 
Stanford's message, love 'em and lead 'em, even played on the national 
stage of the '96 democratic convention. I am here as a crusader for 
America's children. But this year, Stanford would use his cancer to 
benefit Seattle's schools. Instead of Flowers, he wanted the money 
to be used to buy new school books for every child. Remembering me 
is not as important as what we have built in every individual child. 
That's what's key to me. He got those books, but against his wishes, 
Seattle still honors him with Flowers. The only order general John 
Stanford's troops, his students and their families, ever disobeyed. 
Mike Boettcher, NBC news, Seattle. Who says there are no battles yet 
to be won and people who will show us how to win them.
