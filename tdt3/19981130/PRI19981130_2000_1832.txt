More than $3 billion has been raised at today's donor conference in 
Washington for the Palestinians. Almost half the money is coming from 
the U.S. and the European Union. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
says the pledges send out a message of hope and will bring concrete 
benefits to the people of the West Bank and Gaza. Our pledges today 
are evidence of the international community's firm commitment to help 
the Palestinian people build lives that are better, freer, and safer, 
and to do our part in laying the foundations for a secure and prosperous 
Middle East. At the start of the conference, President Clinton announced 
he is doubling America's aid to the Palestinians.
