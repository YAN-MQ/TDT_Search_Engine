Near Huntsville Texas tonight, the search continues for the first 
inmate to escape from death row in Texas since the 1930 rz. Martin 
gurule has been on the run for four days now. Today, police showed 
us exactly where the escape took place. Here's ABC's Steve Osunsami. 
This is the watchtower 29-year-old Martin gurule ran past, avoiding 
18 to 20 rounds of gunfire. He cleared these razor-top fences. And 
when he made his Thanksgiving night escape from this maximum securityion 
for the Texas prison system. Bloodhounds lost his trail off a highway, 
and as the search entered its fourth evening, police admit their man 
could be long gone. We're going to still concentrate in this immediate 
area, until we find out otherwise. Gurule was on death row for the 
1992 murder of a corpus Christi restaurant owner. Six other death 
row inmates joined him in the escape, but were captured. Investigators 
who questioned say they don't believe gurule had help on the outside. 
The inmate has not had any visitors since July of this year. So we're 
not getting any signal out of correspondence that he had any outside 
help. Some 500 prison guards are stationed all across Huntsville, 
and residents, most of whom work for one of the seven local prisons, 
are also on high alert. Thank you, MA'am, be careful. Tips are now 
pouring in, including a report of a stolen car over the weekend. Police 
won't say if a lead is promising, and point out that most of the evidence 
suggests that gurule is still here. Steve Osunsami, ABC News, Huntsville, 
Texas.
