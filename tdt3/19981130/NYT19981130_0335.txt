Casey Silver, the chairman of troubled Universal Pictures, was ousted 
Monday after the dismal box-office results of the studio's most recent 
big-budget films, ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City.'' 
Silver, a low-key and popular figure at Universal, will be replaced 
by his boss, Ron Meyer, who is president and chief operating officer 
of Universal Studios. Meyer told Silver of his removal Sunday night 
after Meyer consulted with Edgar Bronfman Jr., the president and chief 
executive of Seagram, which owns the studio. ``It was time to change 
the dynamic,'' Meyer said. ``It's not about one movie or two movies. 
It's about the direction we've been in. It's time to change the course 
a bit.'' He added, ``We haven't had the success some of our films 
deserved.'' ``The movie business is about good product, luck, timing, 
minimizing your losses and being as financially responsible as you 
can possibly be,'' Meyer said. Silver, who has worked as a top executive 
at Universal for 12 years and has run Universal Pictures for the last 
three of those years, will become a producer there. ``I would have 
preferred to finish the job I started,'' Silver said. ``We're coming 
off a disappointing year. It's management's prerogative to change 
the team, and I respect that.'' He predicted that the company's two 
forthcoming films, ``Psycho,'' a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic, 
and ``Patch Adams,'' a comedy-drama with Robin Williams, would prove 
successful. ``There's a really deep program of movies coming up over 
the next couple of years, which is a testament to the entire team 
here,'' he said. Meyer, a former talent agent and founder of the Creative 
Artists Agency, is on the firing line for the first time as a studio 
chief with direct responsibility for the production and marketing 
of 20 or so films a year. Only two weeks ago, Meyer took over the 
responsibilities of his boss, Frank Biondi Jr., the chief executive 
of Universal Studios, who was dismissed by Bronfman. Biondi, who left 
with a settlement of about $30 million, oversaw films, theme parks 
and television. Across Hollywood, talent agents and producers said 
they doubted that Meyer would assume the long-term responsibilities 
of running the studio day to day as well as do his other jobs. Several 
executives at rival companies have been mentioned as replacements 
for Silver, notably Mike De Luca, president of production at New Line 
Cinema. The announcement Monday also named Stacey Snider, a Universal 
executive, as president of production and Kevin Misher as co-president 
of production. Misher will report to Ms. Snider. Both will work with 
Meyer and are expected to play an increased role at the studio. Meyer 
said the decision to oust Silver had little to do with the weekend's 
disastrous box-office revenues for ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' the 
sequel to ``Babe,'' a 1995 children's fable about a talking pig. The 
newer film, which cost at least $90 million to produce, took in only 
$8.5 million over the five-day Thanksgiving holiday and was overwhelmed 
by three family films: ``A Bug's Life,'' made by Pixar and Disney, 
which took in a record $46.5 million during the five-day Thanksgiving 
holiday; ``The Rugrats Movie,'' based on the television series, and 
``The Waterboy,'' the Adam Sandler comedy. At the same time, ``Meet 
Joe Black,'' a romantic drama starring Brad Pitt, which also cost 
at least $90 million to produce and $25 million to $30 million to 
market, has grossed only $36 million since it opened on Nov. 13. The 
film's box-office revenue was a bitter disappointment to Universal 
executives. Beyond the ``Babe'' sequel and ``Meet Joe Black,'' Universal 
stumbled at the box office with critically acclaimed films like ``Primary 
Colors,'' ``One True Thing'' and ``Out of Sight,'' as well as duds 
like ``Mercury Rising,'' ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' and ``Blues 
Brothers 2000.'' Universal has two more films scheduled for release 
before the end of the year. One, ``Patch Adams,'' is about a real-life 
doctor who uses humor to help treat patients. More problematic is 
a remake of ``Psycho,'' which opens Friday. The new version, directed 
by Gus Van Sant, is a scene-by-scene replica of the Hitchcock classic. 
Van Sant and the producer, Brian Grazer, have taken the unusual step 
of not showing the film to critics or journalists before its opening. 
This is often a sign of a poor movie, but Grazer insists that this 
is not the case in this instance. ``We made this choice before even 
preproduction when we met with Patricia Hitchcock,'' said Grazer, 
referring to Hitchcock's daughter and heir. ``Hitchcock didn't have 
a premiere, he didn't have sneak previews or have the press see the 
movie early. He made the movie for $1 million. We made it for $20 
million, which is exactly the same amount based on inflation. He made 
it in six weeks, we made it in six weeks. We made the decision early 
on to do everything the same.'' Universal and Seagram have been in 
turmoil over the last year or two, with a revolving door of executives 
and some high-level dismissals. Aside from Biondi, two other top executives, 
Howard L. Weitzman and Sanford R. Climan, have been forced out, together 
with the movie studio's president of production, Marc Platt, and its 
marketing chiefs, Buffy Shutt and Kathy Jones.
