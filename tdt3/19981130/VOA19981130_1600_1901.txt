Israel's defense minister has ruled out an Israeli troop withdrawal 
from Southern Lebanon in spite of mounting Israeli killings by Hezbollah 
guerrillas there. In a heated meeting in parliament, Yitzhak Mordecai 
said Israeli generals agree that keeping the buffer zone as the only 
way to fend off Hezbollah raids. Labor Party lawmakers, Yosi Vylin, 
called the statement a lie, saying many support a full withdrawal. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants Beirut to guarantee Hezbollah 
will not attack Israel. Lebanon and Syria say the Israeli pull out 
must be unconditional.
