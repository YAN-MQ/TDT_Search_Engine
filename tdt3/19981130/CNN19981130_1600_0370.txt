The year 2000 census is the focus of a legal dispute before the Supreme 
Court. The census bureau estimates 4 million people were not counted 
in 1990. The Clinton administration wants to use statistical sampling 
to fill in the gaps. House republicans oppose that, saying the constitution 
requires a head count, not an estimate. The Supreme Court's decision 
is expected to affect billions of dollars in federal aid, as well 
as the shape of election districts nationwide.
