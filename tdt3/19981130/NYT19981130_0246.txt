LOS ANGELES _ ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' is a big hit. But can an ``N.Y.Ph.D. 
Blue'' be one too? David Milch, the executive producer of the ``N.Y.P.D. 
Blue'' television series, is working on a pilot for a similar dramatic 
series about scientists. But compared with cops, he said at a recent 
conference of scientists and filmmakers, scientists are a tough sell. 
``Frankenstein gets a lot of business, `Nova' doesn't,'' he said. 
``Science is out of reach as perceived by the vast, vast, vast majority 
of people. There are deep misgivings in the public consciousness about 
the devil's bargain science has made.'' Apparently many in Hollywood 
agree. From Dr. Frankenstein to Dr. Strangelove, from the grave robbers 
of yesteryear to the cloners of today, scientists in movies are almost 
invariably mad, evil, antisocial, clumsy or eccentric. And science 
and technology themselves are usually seen as forces of destruction 
rather than of good. In television dramas, scientists barely appear 
at all, unless one counts ``The X Files.'' Only 2 percent of the characters 
in prime-time dramas from 1994 to 1997 were scientists, well behind 
businessmen, entertainers, police officers, doctors and lawyers, according 
to a survey directed by George Gerbner at Temple University. Some 
scientists think Hollywood is guilty of poor casting. ``Very few scientists 
I know are anywhere close to being loony bins,'' said Dr. James D. 
Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize in 1962 for discovering the structure 
of DNA. ``A lot of us are more like Michael Douglas _ slightly evil, 
highly competitive,'' he added, referring to roles often played by 
the actor. Indeed, Hollywood's treatment of scientists is out of sync 
with that of the press, which generally presents scientists as articulate 
people making important discoveries. Silicon Valley engineers have 
become role models in the new economy and cover boys for national 
magazines. And surveys by the National Science Foundation show that 
Americans on the whole are more optimistic about science and technology 
than people in other developed countries. So now, a few efforts are 
being mounted to get Hollywood to portray scientists in a more realistic 
light, as people with more complex drives and emotions. These efforts 
also aim at getting Hollywood to portray the process of scientific 
inquiry itself. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has spent $2 million 
so far on a program to encourage more thoughtful treatment of science. 
It gave a grant to Milch, for example, to develop his pilot. To influence 
the next generation of filmmakers, the foundation, which is based 
in New York, is also offering prizes of up to $25,000 to students 
at six film schools who make movies about science or engineering. 
``There's a basis for the stereotype but there's more than the stereotype,'' 
said Doron Weber, an author and former scriptwriter who heads the 
Sloan project. ``Science and technology offer a potential gold mine 
for screenwriters and filmmakers _ wonderful, diverse characters and 
great stories that have largely gone untold.'' A group of scientists 
affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science 
has also been trying to sell the networks on a science drama. And 
the American Institute of Engineers, a small group that aims to improve 
the image of its profession, is hoping to interest networks in creating 
an annual black-tie awards show for technology and a series called 
``L.A. Engineer.'' ```L.A. Law' did marvelous things for the legal 
profession,'' said Martin Gottlieb, president of the engineering group. 
``It revealed the humanness behind the scenes.'' More than just a 
desire to feel appreciated, however, is behind such efforts. A better 
image of scientists and engineers could lead to more people entering 
those fields and to greater public support for projects ranging from 
space exploration to particle accelerators. ``To raise the level of 
public understanding of science is the work of the Lord,'' said the 
scientist who is spearheading the Advancement of Science effort, Dr. 
Leon M. Lederman, director emeritus of the Fermilab National Accelerator 
Laboratory. Society needs to make complex decisions about technology 
rationally, Lederman said, adding, ``Somebody raises an issue like 
radiation and the fear takes over.'' But the cultural gap between 
scientists and entertainers remains wide. This became clear when the 
Sloan Foundation brought some eminent scientists here two weeks ago 
for a series of panel discussions with Hollywood directors and producers. 
One of the discussions degenerated into a raucous name-calling exchange. 
``I don't meet as many scientists who can meet my eyes in conversation 
as I do people who pump gas,'' Milch said. Watson shot back that Milch 
was a ``misfit from the Yale English department'' who was afraid of 
science. Milch, who was also the co-creator of ``Hill Street Blues,'' 
said it would be a challenge to get viewers to sympathize with scientists. 
The drama he is working on will do that by using a ``surrogate villain,'' 
like a research administrator who treats scientists badly. Another 
challenge, he said, is that the scientific method, with its emphasis 
on repetition of experiments, might by its very nature be ``antithetical 
to the art of story-telling.'' The best stories, he and other Hollywood 
types said, involve human emotions. The top-rated drama ``E.R.'' has 
lots of medical content in its emergency rooms but is really about 
the doctors, nurses and patients involved. But some of the scientists 
did not see it that way. ``The natural world is fascinating in its 
own right,'' said Dr. Richard Dawkins, an Oxford University biologist 
and author of ``The Selfish Gene'' and other books. ``It really doesn't 
need human drama to be fascinating.'' In an interview after the meeting, 
Dawkins wondered why ``Jurassic Park'' had to have any people in it 
at all when it had dinosaurs. Carolyn Porco, a professor of planetary 
sciences at the University of Arizona, said that too many movies with 
science themes were about space battles in the future. ``It's always 
the physical confrontation that TV and movies seem to harp on, when 
science is the confrontation of ideas,'' she said. ``There's drama 
just in the quest for the truth.'' Dr. Porco was an adviser on the 
movie ``Contact,'' which starred Jodie Foster as Ellie Arroway, an 
astronomer searching for life on other planets. Dr. Porco said the 
movie presented a fairly realistic portrait of a scientist, but she 
wondered why the scriptwriters insisted Ellie have a love affair. 
She said an early version of the script had Ellie sleeping with her 
thesis adviser. ``I know no one who has done that who is a successful 
female scientist,'' she said. The panelists seemed to agree that some 
movies combined scientific inquiry with emotion. One example was ``The 
Race for the Double Helix,'' the story of Dr. Watson and Francis Crick's 
competition with other scientists to decipher the structure of DNA. 
Starring Jeff Goldblum as the young James Watson, it was shown on 
cable television in the United States. But such examples are rare. 
Anne Eisenberg, former dean of humanities at Polytechnic University 
in Brooklyn, surveyed 100 science-related movies made between 1984 
and 1994 and found almost none that portrayed scientists and their 
accomplishments in a positive light. The most positive, she said, 
was ``Awakenings,'' in which Robin Williams played a neurological 
researcher who helped revive nearly catatonic patients. Steven L. 
Goldman, a professor of philosophy at Lehigh University, found overwhelmingly 
negative depictions of science and technology in 100 films made before 
the mid-1980s, starting with Fritz Lang's ``Metropolis'' in 1926 and 
Charlie Chaplin's ``Modern Times'' in 1936. Even ``Star Wars,'' which 
is full of gee-whiz technology, ends with Luke Skywalker defeating 
the Death Star by turning off his computers and trusting the spiritual 
``Force,'' Goldman said. One of the most common themes, in movies 
from ``Frankenstein'' to ``Jurassic Park,'' is that of scientists 
trying to play God or technology running amok, with deadly consequences. 
In ``The Mosquito Coast,'' Harrison Ford plays an engineer who tries 
to impose ``straight lines and right angles'' on unruly nature, only 
to have all he created destroyed in the end. The premise of the ``Terminator'' 
movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger is that three billion human 
beings are destroyed in the future by the computers created using 
a powerful microprocessor. In other movies there are heartless scientists, 
like the ones that wanted to dissect E.T. There are pawns of big corporations, 
like those in ``The China Syndrome.'' There are demented criminals, 
like Freeze and Poison Ivy in ``Batman and Robin.'' And there are 
absent-minded or clumsy nerds, as in ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' 
and ``Back to the Future,'' not to mention all those films featuring 
awkward computer whizzes who can't get a date. Even some laudatory 
movies show scientists as somewhat emotionally detached. In ``Madame 
Curie,'' made in 1943, the famous scientist does not react when her 
husband is killed. ``We know from a letter that when they brought 
her husband's corpse in she hurled herself at it and kissed it and 
cried,'' said Spencer Weart, director of the Center for History of 
Physics at the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Md. 
To some extent scientists are mistrusted as witches once were, as 
people possessing secret knowledge or power, Weart said. But the negative 
portrayals also reflect more concrete fears of the possible consequences 
of science, particularly the atom bomb. ``It was perceived in pop 
culture that science let the atom out of the box and it was a scary 
thing,'' said John Copeland, the producer of the television series 
``Babylon 5.'' But Copeland said he thought the portrayal of scientists 
was becoming somewhat more favorable. ``We grew up watching the space 
program,'' he said. ``We grew up inspired by a type of science.'' 
Next year the Fox network will broadcast ``Killer App,'' the pilot 
for a series about Silicon Valley created by the Doonesbury cartoonist 
Garry Trudeau and the filmmaker Robert Altman. But other efforts still 
have a long way to go. Lederman, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics 
in 1988 for his work with Fermilab, was able to gain audiences with 
the heads of some television networks a few years ago, but his project 
has gone virtually nowhere since. ``We're ready to track down the 
first cousin of Steven Spielberg's cleaning lady,'' he said. The American 
Institute of Engineers sent a proposal to David Geffen, the Hollywood 
mogul, that was returned unopened, Gottlieb said. The Sloan Foundation 
hopes to have a script for the pilot within a year, but Milch is still 
not sure he will be able to produce a workable one. And of the first 
three student films awarded prizes by Sloan, two portrayed tormented, 
antisocial scientists, the very stereotype the foundation is trying 
to fight. The third film was not about science at all. The original 
scientific content, the student director said, was removed from the 
screenplay to make the picture more interesting.
