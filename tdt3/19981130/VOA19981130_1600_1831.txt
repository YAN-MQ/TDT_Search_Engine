President Clinton has called for $400 million in additional U.S. aid 
to the Palestinians as part of an international effort to support 
the Middle East peace process. From the State Department, VOA's Kyle 
King reports. Speaking to delegates at the start of an international 
donors conference at the State Department, Mr. Clinton called for 
greater private investment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Each investment 
makes previous investments more likely to succeed. It is good economic 
policy and it's the right thing to do. Mr. Clinton said he would work 
with the U.S. Congress to boost aid to the Palestinians by $400 million. 
That would be in addition to the $100 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians 
already pledged for next year. More than 45 countries and international 
organizations are attending the donors conference in Washington. The 
conference will try to raise more than $3 billion in economic development 
funds in an effort to reinforce the peace process. Kyle King, VOA 
News, the State Department.
