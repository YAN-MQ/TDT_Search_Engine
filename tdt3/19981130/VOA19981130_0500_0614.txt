China's President Jhang Zhe Minh is on his way back to Beijing ending 
the first official visit of a Chinese head of state to Japan. President 
Jhang wrapped up the six-day visit with stops in Sindai and Soporo 
where he was greeted by hundreds of Japanese and Chinese exchange 
students waving flags. Mr. Jhang's trip ended without securing a written 
apology for Japanese wartime atrocities in China.
