The Romanian president urged people to be optimistic about their future 
Monday, amid criticism of extravagance for spending an estimated dlrs 
300,000 on festivities marking the country's national day. Romania's 
national day marks the country's reunion with Transylvania, on Dec. 
1, 1918 and is supposed to celebrate unity among its 23 million people. 
But this year political leaders have been riven by disagreement. ``Although 
the country is on the brink of despair, enormous amounts of money 
are being spent,'' Ticu Dumitrescu, a lawmaker was quoted as saying 
in daily Evenimentul Zilei on Monday. ``What's more, all the festivities 
are being held in (former dictator Nicolae) Ceausescu's palace... 
hardly a citadel of democracy.'' The government is to stage a huge 
military parade in front of Ceausescu's palace Tuesday, which will 
cost the country 3 billion lei (dlrs 300,000) _ more than 30 percent 
of the annual military budget _ daily Jurnal National reported. For 
the past week, tanks have rolled past the giant palace, which now 
houses Romania's parliament. Military planes and helicopters have 
flown low over Bucharest and hundreds of soldiers have marched outside 
its gates for days, rehearsing for the festivities. Speaking from 
the Transylvanian city of Alba Iulia to mark 80 years since Romania 
was reunited with Transylvania President Emil Constantinescu said 
Monday: ``The country is in winter, blanketed by snow and fog ... 
but we must go on.'' Former King Michael, who was in Romania over 
the weekend to officially mark the celebrations, quit the country 
ahead of the festivities to avoid getting embroiled in the discord. 
Thanks to his grandmother Queen Marie, Transylvania returned to Romania 
in 1918 as part of the spoils of WWI.
