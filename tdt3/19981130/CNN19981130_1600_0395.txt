The Supreme Court has let stand a lower court ruling, which upheld 
the boy scouts' right to suspend the gay leader of one of its programs 
for young adults. In 1992, the Scouts claimed Charles merino's homosexuality 
violated the scout oath, which requires members to be morally straight. 
Merino argued his suspension violated a California anti-discrimination 
law. A state appeals court decided the law did not apply to the boy 
Scouts. The Supreme Court declined to review the case.
