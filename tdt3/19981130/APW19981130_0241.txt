Shares in the oil and petrochemical company Petrofina SA, a giant 
in Belgian business, were suspended Monday following a report it will 
likely be sold to a leading European oil group in the next few days. 
Monday's edition of La Libre Belgique newspaper said negotiators from 
an unidentified potential buyer had reached a breakthrough over the 
weekend with Petrofina's leading shareholder Albert Frere, agreeing 
to the terms of a buyout. The company refused to comment Monday. Instead, 
Petrofina announced a press conference for early Tuesday. Petrofina 
stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors that the company 
was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA. Other companies rumored 
to be interested were France's Total SA and Italy's ENI SpA. Petrofina, 
which employs some 15,000 people worldwide is one of Belgium's biggest 
industrial companies. Its interests in other enterprises forced the 
suspension in trading of other shares too, including energy company 
Electrabel, utilities company Tractebel SA, holding companies Companie 
National a Portefeuille, Sidro, Sofina SA, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert 
SA and Electrafina SA.
