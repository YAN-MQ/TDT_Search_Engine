it looks like Michael Jackson may be following in David Bowie's footsteps. 
His record sales have been slipping. Could it be that Michael is looking 
to raise some quick cash? Newsweek Magazine reports that the King 
of Pop is thinking about a bond sale that would raise $100 million 
or so. The magazine says that Jackson would follow the highly profitable 
example of David Bowie who took in $55 million last year by selling 
so-called Bowie Bonds on anticipated royalties. Jackson would be doing 
the same thing, basically borrowing money on future profits from his 
past hits, and the 250 Beatles tunes that he owns.
