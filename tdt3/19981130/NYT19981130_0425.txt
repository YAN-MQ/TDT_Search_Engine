As Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. reorganizes so that it can issue 
stock, the big winners are likely to be the company's executives. 
The 12 million policyholders _ who are formally the owners of the 
mutual company _ are to share a one-time payout of $14 billion in 
accumulated profits when Met Life, as the company is called, converts. 
But the executives will be perpetually in line for stock options, 
bonuses and generally higher salaries. ``Historically, the income 
of executives in companies converting from mutual to stock ownership 
has increased substantially,'' said James Corcoran, a former New York 
insurance commissioner who is now a partner in the Manhattan law firm 
of Winston &AMP; Strawn. That may prove to be a powerful understatement. 
Graef Crystal, an executive compensation specialist in San Diego, 
said that judging from the rewards of senior executives at other major 
U.S. corporations, the top people at Met Life might well take home 
``tens of millions of dollars'' in stock options in the coming decade. 
``And for the chief executive,'' he said, ``it might easily be more 
than $100 million.'' In a study of 279 of the top 500 companies, for 
example, Crystal found that chief executives last year received stock 
options with an average current value of $5 million. ``Since Metropolitan 
is much bigger than the average company in the survey,'' Crystal said, 
``I would expect the CEO there to get 6, 7, 8 million dollars in options.'' 
As a mutual company owned by policyholders, Met Life had, by definition, 
no publicly traded stock with which to reward executives. So executives' 
pay tended to trail that of their counterparts at stock companies. 
That, many analysts said, sharply reduced the pool of executives from 
which mutual companies could recruit. ``You can't be a player if you're 
a company without stock options,'' said Crystal. Kevin Foley, a spokesman 
for Met Life, said that the company's decision to move toward reorganization, 
which was announced on Sunday, was not motivated by the prospect of 
increased compensation for Robert Benmosche, the chief executive, 
and others in the executive suite. ``We have given no thought to this 
issue,'' he said. ``It just isn't part of our planning at this time. 
Our first priority is to make sure that policyholders get 100 percent 
of the value of the company. And there are no plans to reward management 
until that takes place.'' While acknowledging the potential for significant 
increases in compensation, Foley said the reward for management would 
not be automatic. ``The results have to dictate the reward,'' he said. 
Benmosche, who became chief executive of Met Life in July, is expected 
to be paid $2.5 million this year, Foley said, $500,000 in salary 
and the rest in bonuses. His pay is likely to be higher next year, 
reflecting his first full year as the top executive, but Foley said 
he had no idea what Benmosche's income would be once Met Life became 
a stock company. Benmosche said on Sunday that Met Life wanted to 
issue stock to be able to raise capital for expansion and to have 
shares that could also be used as currency to buy other companies. 
Analysts say that has been the driving force behind reorganizations 
planned at Prudential Life Insurance Co. of America, John Hancock 
Life Insurance Co. and others. A natural byproduct of the change, 
they say, is much higher compensation for management. ``These guys 
are going to make out like bandits,'' said Wayne Roberts, a longtime 
agent and a founding member of the Life Insurance Committee for Social 
Responsibility. ``But that is the nature of big business. My primary 
concern was to see that the policyholders got a fair shake, and I 
think that's been achieved.'' Alexander Grannis, the Manhattan Democrat 
who is chairman of the state Assembly's Insurance Committee, defeated 
an attempt by Met Life and others earlier this year to create a hybrid 
form of stock company that would have permitted reorganization without 
sharing accumulated profits with policyholders. Grannis said Monday 
he believed the company was now on a course that would protect policyholders' 
interests. He added, ``I don't think this is a grab for riches by 
the management.'' The reorganization will be governed by a 1988 law 
that does not describe how shares might be allocated to management 
or detail how a stock-option plan is to be set up. But Corcoran, who 
was insurance commissioner when the law was enacted, said that such 
details must be explained in a public plan for reorganization and 
must be approved by policyholders and the insurance commissioner. 
``The issue here is full disclosure,'' he said. Industry specialists 
said that executives moving into the turbulent world of publicly traded 
companies should expect to receive sharp increases in pay as they 
give up job security, face previously nonexistent pressures from shareholders 
and work against performance measures that are much more defined than 
in mutual organizations. ``Obviously you want to reward executives 
of a company that goes forward and does better,'' Corcoran said. ``There's 
nothing wrong with that.'' Under the hybrid structure that Met Life 
had lobbied for, with the support of Gov. George Pataki, company executives 
could have received as much as 18 percent of the shares of a reorganized 
mutual company, Corcoran said. While there is some room for interpretation, 
Corcoran said that current law suggests that management will be limited 
to owning no more than 5 percent of the company's stock. ``The bottom 
line,'' said Grannis, ``is that if the officers and directors get 
greedy, it may have an impact on their stock value. They've got to 
sell their stock to willing buyers looking at overhead and profitability 
and making judgments on whether it's a good buy. The combination of 
Met's traditional conservative management history, the oversight from 
the Insurance Department and the discipline of the marketplace would 
seem to temper any effort to reward executives out of proportion to 
their contributions.''
