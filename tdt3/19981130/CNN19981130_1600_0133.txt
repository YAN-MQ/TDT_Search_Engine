Attorney general Janet Reno has asked a three-judge federal appeals 
court for an extension to decide if she should seek the appointment 
of her eighth independent counsel. Reno now has 60 days to decide 
if the investigation of former White House aide Harold Ickes warrants 
an independent counsel. The justice department has been looking into 
allegations Ickes lied to a Senate committee about whether the Clinton 
administration attempted to intervene in a teamsters union labor dispute. 
Ickes has denied any wrongdoing.
