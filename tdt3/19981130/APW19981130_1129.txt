Confirming what human rights organizations and Palestinian detainees 
have long contended, an Israeli security interrogator has admitted 
in court testimony that he used physical pressure to extract information 
from a Palestinian suspect. Said Zoarub, accused of membership in 
Hamas and assisting in a 1995 suicide bombing, has since retracted 
the confession he gave to the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security 
agency, claiming it was made under duress. In a special Israeli military 
court hearing held Oct. 20 to discuss the validity of the confession, 
the interrogator, identified in court transcripts only as ``N,'' said 
he and others tied, twisted and kept Zoarub hooded for several hours 
at a time. On six separate occasions over three days in April 1997, 
Zoarub was forced to stand, arms stretched above his head and handcuffed 
to an anchor above him, for as long as three hours. ``This method 
is intended to further the revelation of the essential information 
which the subject does not wish to divulge,'' N said in his testimony. 
Transcripts of the hearing were made available to The Associated Press 
Monday. During the interrogations, Zoarub confessed to involvement 
in Hamas activities. His trial is still in progress and it was unclear 
how the court would rule regarding the validity of the confession. 
At other points during the 21 days Zoarub spent at an unnamed Shin 
Bet facility, N said Zoarub was seated on a low chair slanted forward, 
with his hands tied behind his back. N said interrogators would tighten 
``the handcuffs as far as possible around the defendant's wrists.'' 
He also said that investigators put a hood over Zoarub, forced him 
to crouch on the ground for hour-long stretches and blasted loud music 
at him. Zoarub's attorney Leah Tsemel said in court that interrogators 
hung Zoarub from the ceiling, deprived him of sleep, put a foul-smelling 
hood over his head that cut off his air supply, and pulled on the 
handcuffs hard enough to cut off blood circulation. N denied the charges. 
The government does not deny that the Shin Bet, whose operations are 
largely secret, uses force to extract information, but court records 
of its methods are rarely open to public view. Israel's Supreme Court 
has ruled the Shin Bet may use ``moderate physical force,'' in questioning 
Palestinians believed to have information vital to preventing a terrorist 
attack. However, human rights groups claim that the vague wording 
allows for torture and has appealed to the Supreme Court and to the 
Israeli Parliament to end widely reported mistreatment of Palestinian 
detainees.
