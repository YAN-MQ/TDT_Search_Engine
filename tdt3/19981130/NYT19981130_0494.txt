In front of the lowered scoreboard with ``Holyfield'' and ``Lewis'' 
in lights, the Madison Square Garden boxing ring was set up about 
where the Eighth Avenue basket would be if the Knicks had a game. 
One by one, Evander Holyfield, in a black suit, and Lennox Lewis, 
in a tan suit, appeared in a spray of fireworks, leaned through the 
burgundy velvet ropes and now stood side by side in the ring, their 
arms crossed defiantly. When the gladiators were introduced to maybe 
300 assembled notebooks, microphones, cameras and various celebrities 
of cafeteria society who had stopped by for the free lunch of sandwiches 
and salads, a larger spray of fireworks suddenly lighted the darkened 
arena. It was a rare moment Monday, one of the few when the cackling 
voice of Don King, who modestly describes himself as ``the world's 
greatest promoter,'' belonged surely to the world's loudest promoter. 
He was in full cry to announce that Holyfield and Lewis would return 
to the Garden ring on March 13 to unify the three world heavyweight 
titles. ``The Garden is the mecca and we are sitting in the temple 
of the mecca,'' King intoned. ``And in the temple, we must be honest.'' 
At first, he was honest, describing himself as ``coming off the mat 
from the Seventh District of New York,'' a reference to his acquittal 
in Federal court last summer on charges of insurance fraud. But he 
left himself open to be indicted for marquee fraud. ``This is going 
to be a fight,'' King screeched, ``of the ilk of Muhammad Ali and 
Joe Frazier.'' Hardly, but it is the Garden's biggest fight since 
Frazier flattened Ali in earning a unanimous 15-round decision on 
March 8, 1971. Ringside tickets that night were an unprecedented $150, 
with each fighter collecting a flat $2.5 million. This time the top 
Garden ticket will be $1,500, the cheapest $100. Holyfield is assured 
$20 million, Lewis $9.5 million. For the Garden, which has put up 
more than $8 million, a sellout of 20,000 would add up to ``north 
of $10 million,'' said Dave Checketts, the Garden president. But there's 
no assurance of a Garden sellout, not with that ticket scale and not 
with TVKO pay-per-view available. So Monday's soiree turned into more 
of a big sell than a big debate over who would win: Holyfield, who 
holds the World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation 
belts, or Lewis, the World Boxing Council champion. ``This fight will 
be called `Kings' Crowning Glory,''' King blared. Presumably, he meant 
``Kings''' as in the two heavyweight kings. But if anybody wants to 
spell it ``King's,'' he won't ask for a correction. Alluding to Lewis' 
English heritage, King even invoked Paul Revere. ``Up in arms! Up 
in arms! The British are coming!'' he shouted. ``Get your tickets 
now because this is going to be an American experience.'' But the 
more King talked Monday, the more it sounded like a business experience. 
``We will sell the Garden out,'' King barked. ``We will do two million 
pay-per-view buys.'' By ``we,'' King meant Don King Promotions, Panix 
Promotions, Home Box Office (which owns TVKO) and Cablevision (which 
owns the Garden). Among those on the dais was Charles F. Dolan, the 
Cablevision impresario who, in his brief remarks, mentioned that King 
is from Cleveland. So, of course, is a certain Yankee principal owner 
whose deal with Dolan is snagged. ``I have noticed,'' Dolan said, 
``that negotiations with sports promoters from Cleveland can require 
a lot of endurance.'' Just listening to King introduce everybody but 
the hot-dog vendors outside the Garden can require even more endurance. 
And after he hogged the microphone for about 90 minutes, the gladiators 
got to speak. ``I'll be stepping out of the ring,'' the 33-year-old 
Lewis said, his dreadlocks dangling, ``with all three belts.'' ``I'll 
tell you now,'' the 36-year-old Holyfield said, his bald head glistening, 
``I will be the undisputed champion.'' Not merely undisputed, as King 
said, ``but also unmitigated and undeniable.'' But not necessarily 
unmotivated. For more than a year Holyfield has been saying that if 
he unified the title, he would retire from boxing. But when he was 
asked about that Monday, he shrugged. ``I'm not going to retire yet,'' 
he said. Yes, in the temple, we must be honest.
