The United States is seeking the extradition of some 30 Nigerians 
implicated in drug-related crimes in the U.S., a visiting congressman 
from California told reporters on Monday. Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif. 
made the comments after meeting Monday with Nigerian presidential 
advisor Emeka Eze during a visit which he said was to help build relations 
between the two countries in the wake of recent Nigerian political 
reforms. ``We would like to use the change of government to resolve 
some of the issues which have undermined relations between Nigeria 
and the United States,'' Campbell said. He did not name the Nigerians 
or specify the crimes for which they are being sought. Eze said the 
Nigerian Foreign Ministry was studying the extradition request and 
planned to ``do something about it.'' However, he expressed Nigeria's 
dissatisfaction that it remained on a list of ``decertified'' countries 
to which the U.S. has blocked development aid because of their poor 
record in fighting drug trafficking. He said that if Nigeria became 
certified, it would ``surely encourage us to do a lot more.'' Since 
taking power following the death of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha 
in June, Nigerian military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has promised 
sweeping reforms including elections and a handover of power to a 
civilian government next year. Nigeria and the U.S. do not have an 
extradition agreement although officials from the two countries have 
recently discussed plans to cooperate fighting drug trafficking.
