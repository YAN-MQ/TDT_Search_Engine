In Boston, our team is always living it up. It includes Connie Blasick, 
Patrick Cox, Catherine Griffin, Valerie Gunderson, Anu Pollin, Steven 
Snyder, William Troop, and Chris Wolfe. Our London team, which has 
also been known to do some lively living includes Mary Louise Kelly, 
Alajandro Martins, Rosie Bartlen, and Kim Tourney. From Boston, I'm 
Lisa Mullins inviting you to join us anytime online at www.theworld.org. 
We'll be back tomorrow with another spin of the world. THE WORLD is 
co-production of the BBC World Service, Public Radio International, 
and WGBH Boston, and is made possible in part by the PRI Program Fund, 
whose contributors include the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Katherine 
T. MacArthur Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and 
the David and Lucille Packard Foundation. PRI, Public Radio International.
