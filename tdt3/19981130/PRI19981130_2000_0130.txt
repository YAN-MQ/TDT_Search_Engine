A London hospital has advised General Augusto Pinochet that he must 
find another place to stay saying the former Chilean dictator no longer 
needs medical treatment. The 83-year-old general has been held under 
police guard at the private hospital while he awaits a decision from 
Britain's Home Secretary on whether he'll be extradited to Spain. 
The hospital statement appears to undermine the arguments of Pinochet's 
lawyers who have said he's too ill to stand trial. Pinochet underwent 
back surgery at the hospital in early October. A Spanish judge wants 
to try him for genocide, torture, and other human rights abuses committed 
during his 17-year regime.
