Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Monday walk away from 
the Mideast peace agreements if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally 
declares statehood in May. Netanyahu's warning came a day after Arafat 
said in Washington that ``I hope that this (coming) year will be the 
year of the independent Palestinian state.'' The new acrimony came 
just a little over a week after the implementation of stage one of 
the land-for-security agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. 
Under the plan, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West 
Bank by the end of January, in exchange for Palestinian measures against 
Islamic militants. As part of the accord, Israel also agreed to free 
750 Palestinian prisoners. In the first stage, Israel released 250, 
most of them criminals, prompting Palestinian complaints that the 
agreement was breached. The Palestinians demand that Israel free political 
activists and those jailed for anti-Israeli activities. The chief 
Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, flew to Washington on Monday 
to raise the issue with Clinton administration officials. ``This is 
a crisis situation and we have asked for American intervention,'' 
Erekat said Sunday. Implementation of the peace accord would be difficult 
to continue under the present circumstances, Erekat said. However, 
Netanyahu said he would not compromise. ``I do not free murderers. 
I do not release people with blood on their hands,'' he told Israel 
radio. Israel holds about 2,500 prisoners. Popular pressure on Arafat 
has grown, with prisoners' relatives demonstrating daily against the 
Palestinian Authority and accusing it of abandoning the prisoners. 
Netanyahu, meanwhile, described Arafat's latest remarks concerning 
statehood as a ``a gross violation'' of the Oslo accords. Netanyahu's 
office issued a statement saying that if Arafat declares a state ``this 
will mean the collapse of the Oslo agreements.'' The five-year period 
of Palestinian autonomy expires in May 1999. At this time, the two 
sides are to have negotiated a permanent peace agreement, but it seems 
highly unlikely the deadline can be met. Arafat has said that once 
the autonomy period is over, he has the right to declare a state without 
waiting for a peace agreement with Israel. Netanyahu has warned that 
he would respond by annexing parts of the West Bank. On Monday, Netanyahu 
did not make specific threats, saying only that ``we can do a great 
deal.'' He said he would raise the issue when his Cabinet meets again 
to consider the next stage of the Wye River peace accord. In another 
possible point of contention, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon 
appointed low-level officials to negotiate an additional Israeli troop 
pullback with the Palestinians. Israel's Cabinet has already decided 
that it would only hand over an additional 1 percent of the West Bank 
in an upcoming troop withdrawal. By naming junior officials without 
a mandate, Israel apparently was sending a message to the Palestinians 
that they would not receive more than the 1 percent already decided 
on. The Palestinian team is headed by Erekat.
