Two men were hanged under Islamic law in Tehran Monday, one for corruption 
and the other for an acid attack on two schoolgirls, Iran's official 
news agency reported. Hossein Dolatkhahan was executed for fraud and 
abuse of public funds, the Islamic Republic News Agency said. Hamid 
Reza Khoshnevis was hanged for throwing acid in the faces of two school 
girls near a motorway in Tehran in early 1997, the agency said. It 
did not mention any motive for the attack. It said the death sentences 
were endorsed by the Supreme Court.
