Voters in Switzerland went to the polls on Sunday, and they just said 
no to drugs. Celicia Sline reports from Geneva. The votes turned down 
the legalization of narcotics by a three to one margin. Despite all 
the debate which preceded the vote, Switzerland decided it was not 
ready to become the only country in the world to legalize drugs. Voters 
believed opposition claims that passage of the measure would fuel 
addiction and make Switzerland a pariah in international law circles. 
The controversial measure was resoundingly defeated by a three to 
one majority. Had it passed, people over the age of 18 would have 
been able to buy the recreational drug of their choice from state 
run shops or pharmacies, after getting a prescription from a doctor. 
The vote makes it clear that the Swiss are satisfied with the status 
quo. Not a single Can ton even the ones that are most liberal in their 
drug policies approved the measure. 75 percent of the voters said 
no. Switzerland already has one of the most liberal drug policies 
in Europe. Last year voters approved a measure allowing the state 
to give heroin to a limited number of hard-core addicts under strict 
medical supervision. A Swiss government official who opposed the drug 
initiative said he was extremely satisfied that Swiss voters had rejected 
the initiative so massively. He said it was inconceivable that the 
Swiss Federal Government should become a super drug dealer. If the 
initiative had passed, the official said, Switzerland's image in Europe 
would have become catastrophic. One of the backers of the initiative 
said she was not surprised that the measure went down to defeat. But 
she added that she didn't expect it would be rejected by so large 
a margin. However, she observed that 25% of the Swiss voted for legalizing 
recreational drugs, and this she said encouraged her to try again.
