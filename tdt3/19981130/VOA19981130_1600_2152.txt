Although traditionally described as the weaker of the human species, 
women have steadily been gaining more power around the world. For 
example, four of the winners of this year's Nobel Peace Prize were 
women. Whether as heads of state or heads of their local communities, 
women are more and more seen as agents for change. The power of women 
is the topic of today's Dateline. Here's Carolyn Weaver. Sometimes 
a heroine or a Nobel Laureate is created in an instant. That was the 
case with Betty Williams, a native of Belfast, Ireland whose immediate 
and intuitive response to horrific acts of violence was to create 
the Northern Ireland Peace Movement. The moment came in 1976 when 
she saw two children hit and killed by an out-of-control getaway car 
carrying a fleeing gunman of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. Ms. 
Williams, the mother of two children herself, said the decision to 
act was easy. I really didn't want my babies to be brought up in a 
society that was destroying children. And so the movement for peace 
in Northern Ireland was began by women. And I believe that women have 
a huge role to play in creating a just, nonviolent, and peaceful world. 
Betty Williams traveled to Virginia earlier this month along with 
several other Nobel laureates to speak about their peacemaking efforts. 
The other women included Ricoberta Manchu of Guatemala and Jodie Williams, 
the American champion of banning land mines. Burmese dissident Ong 
San Suji was invited to the conference but was not permitted by her 
government to attend.
