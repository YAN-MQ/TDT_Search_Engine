The United States on Monday pledged an extra $400 million in aid to 
the Palestinians, which is expected to nearly double the amount of 
their economic assistance from the United States over the next five 
years. The announcement was made by President Clinton at the start 
of a one-day international donor conference sponsored by the State 
Department, which brought an estimated total of more than $3 billion 
in new pledges of aid for the Palestinians. In a speech to open the 
conference here, Clinton said the United States had decided to increase 
aid in hopes of convincing the Palestinians to stick to the peace 
accord with Israel. ``We must convince those who have invested so 
much in this process that it was a sound investment,'' he said. ``For 
too long, too many young people have turned to terrorism and old hatreds 
partly because they had nothing better to do. We must give them a 
different future to believe in.'' Appealing for generous contributions 
from other wealthy nations, he said that the peace efforts had so 
far brought ``too little tangible improvement in the life of the Palestinian 
people.'' At the last major international donors conference in October 
1993, shortly after completion of the Oslo peace agreement between 
the Palestinians and Israel, the United States made a five-year pledge 
to the Palestinians of $500 million. Clinton administration officials 
said that before the announcement on Monday, the United States had 
expected to continue to provide about $100 million a year in aid to 
the Palestinians. But with Clinton's addition of $400 million, the 
total package of American economic assistance should total about $900 
million over the next five years. The additional aid reflects a promise 
made by Clinton to pay for steps needed to carry out the latest land-for-peace 
deal between the Palestinians and the Israelis, which was hammered 
out in a summit meeting in October in Wye, Md., with Yasser Arafat, 
the Palestinian leader, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. 
Clinton said that despite large aid grants in the past, the Palestinian 
economy had continued to falter. ``Per capita income is down, unemployment 
is too high, living conditions are extremely difficult,'' he said. 
``An honest assessment would lead us to the conclusion that we have 
not realized all our intentions.'' The United States is particularly 
eager to see improvement in the Palestinian economy to help Arafat 
blunt the influence of the militant Islamic group Hamas, which has 
sought public support through sponsorship of medical clinics, schools 
and sports clubs in the West Bank and Gaza. After meeting with Clinton 
in the White House, Arafat appeared at the conference to make a plea 
for pledges, warning that ``the Palestinian economy has witnessed 
a continuous decline.'' He accused Israel of undermining the Palestinian 
economy through its repeated closing of the border between Israel 
and the Palestinian territories in response to what Israel has described 
as terrorist threats. ``The Israeli closure policy is the primary 
and direct cause for the dangerous decline in the performance of the 
Palestinian economy over the past five years,'' he said. At a news 
conference to announce the results of the donors' conference, Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright said: ``We do not have exact pledges, 
but it appears that delegations pledged more than $3 billion today, 
well above the $2.3 billion pledged at the 1993 donor conference, 
and that by itself is a substantial achievement.'' She said the pledges 
``are evidence of the international community's firm commitment to 
help the Palestinian people build lives that are better, freer and 
safer, and to do our part in laying the foundations for a secure and 
prosperous Middle East.'' American officials said that other large 
donations of aid had been pledged by the European Union, $480 million; 
Japan, $200 million; Norway, which organized the secret talks that 
led to the 1993 Oslo peace accords, $175 million; Saudi Arabia, $100 
million; Kuwait, $80 million, and Canada, $30 million. American officials 
and Arafat brushed aside questions on Monday about news reports last 
weekend suggesting that millions of dollars in British aid earmarked 
for housing projects in the West Bank and Gaza had been diverted to 
build luxury apartments for key deputies to Arafat. ``That's an issue 
for the British,'' said a senior American official, noting that the 
U.S. aid to the Palestinians goes directly to contractors and private 
groups involved in development projects, not to Arafat's Palestinian 
Authority. ``This is not an issue for the United States.'' Ms. Albright 
said at her news conference that in the distribution of American aid 
to the Palestinians, ``every dollar is accounted for and it's completely 
transparent.''
