Last week, the Georgia Supreme Court did for its state what the U.S. 
Supreme Court would not do for the nation _ it tossed law enforcement 
officials out of the bedroom. Back in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court 
in Bowers vs. Hardwick upheld the constitutionality of Georgia's law 
criminalizing sodomy _ under the high court's interpretation of the 
U.S. Constitution. It was a 5-4 decision that revealed an unsettling 
peek at the homophobia of some of the members of the court. A police 
officer had entered Michael Hardwick's Atlanta apartment, looked into 
the bedroom and found Hardwick having sex with another male. Hardwick 
was arrested and charged under the state's sodomy statute. The law 
reads, in part: ``a person commits the offense of sodomy when he performs 
or submits to any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person 
and the mouth and anus of another.'' When the charge was dropped, 
Hardwick filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the 
law in federal court _ hoping the U.S. Constitution would protect 
his right of privacy in his own bedroom. The law, itself, makes no 
distinction on whether an act of sodomy is committed by homosexuals 
or heterosexuals; it's still a felony. Presumably, a husband and wife 
could have been charged under the law. The nation's high court, in 
a decision written by Justice Byron White, states that no right of 
privacy found in the U.S. Constitution includes ``a fundamental right 
to engage in homosexual sodomy.'' Notice that the court's focus is 
only on homosexual sodomy. The court makes it clear in a footnote 
to the decision that the justices were not ruling on the constitutionality 
of the Georgia law as it applies to heterosexual sodomy. Chief Justice 
Warren Burger, in his concurring opinion, adds: ``To hold that the 
act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right 
would be to case aside millennia of moral teaching.'' Of course, the 
federal Constitution does not explicitly grant a fundamental right 
to engage in sodomy _ or any other sex act. The question that the 
court should have answered, the real issue behind the set of facts 
in that case: Does the federal Constitution recognize the right of 
privacy surrounding the most intimate of human activity, sex between 
consenting adults? U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell wrote a 
lukewarm concurring opinion that he would later regret. He provided 
the crucial fifth vote to uphold the sodomy law. After Powell retired, 
he publicly declared that the Hardwick decision was a mistake. Twelve 
years later, on Nov. 23, the Supreme Court of Georgia in Powell vs. 
The State corrected the mistake _ for Georgians, anyway. Anthony San 
Juan Powell was charged with rape and aggravated sodomy in regard 
to sexual conduct involving him and his wife's niece. Powell testified 
that he had sex with the young woman including cunnilingus _ with 
her consent. After Powell's admission, the judge added the charge 
of sodomy. The jury acquitted Powell of rape and aggravated sodomy, 
believing that the woman had given her consent, but found him guilty 
of sodomy. In the sodomy law, consent doesn't matter. Powell appealed 
to the state's highest court _ contending that the law criminalizes 
acts of sodomy committed by consenting adults in private and thereby 
violates the right of privacy guaranteed to all Georgia citizens by 
their state constitution. The Georgia high court agreed. In a strongly 
worded 6-1 decision, the court struck down the state's sodomy law. 
The decision was written by Chief Justice Robert Benham. He notes 
that ``the right of privacy has a long and distinguished history in 
Georgia.'' In 1905, the state's highest court recognized that Georgia 
citizens have a ``liberty of privacy'' guaranteed by Georgia's Bill 
of Rights. The Georgia Supreme Court, in fact, recognized privacy 
rights long before any other state appellate courts or the U.S. Supreme 
Court did. And now, according to Benham, Georgia recognizes that the 
right of privacy has ``a value so essential to individual liberty 
in our society that its infringement merits careful scrutiny by the 
courts.'' In a footnote, Benham adds: ``Privacy rights protected by 
the U.S. Constitution are not at issue in this case.'' And thus, he 
points out, Bowers vs. Hardwick is not applicable to the discussion. 
In the 1905 Georgia case, Pavesich vs. New England Life Insurance, 
the court found ``the right of privacy to be `ancient law,' with `its 
foundations in the instincts of nature ... making it immutable and 
absolute.''' This liberty includes ``the right to live as one will, 
so long as that will does not interfere with the rights of another 
or of the public.'' Benham strikes the key issue in the Powell case: 
``We cannot think of any other activity that reasonable persons would 
rank as more private and more deserving of protection from governmental 
interference than consensual, private, adult sexual activity.'' He 
closes his argument: ``The only possible purpose for the ((sodomy)) 
statute is to regulate the private conduct of consenting adults, the 
public gains no benefit, and the individual is unduly oppressed by 
the invasion of the right to privacy. Consequently, we must conclude 
that the legislation exceeds the permissible bounds of the police 
power.'' In the mid-1970s, U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, 
dismayed at how the nation's highest court had begun to renege on 
individual rights in its reading of the federal Constitution, called 
on state courts to ``step into the breach'' and interpret their own 
state constitutions more expansively in the service of liberty. The 
Georgia high court has righted a grievous wrong. Other state courts 
should follow its lead _ in the service of freedom.
