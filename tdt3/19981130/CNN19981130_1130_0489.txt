Health and human services secretary Donna Shalala is going back to 
her ancestral Homeland as a U.S. envoy. She'll represent President 
Clinton in talks with newly-installed Lebanese president. Sources 
say sending Shalala, the administration's top-ranking arab-American, 
demonstrates Washington's desire to strengthen ties with the mideastern 
state. She will also visit Israel and the West Bank during her visit.
