Quentin Crewe, who fell down so much as a child and bounced back with 
such good cheer that he grew up to challenge prevailing stereotypes 
as an iconoclastic journalist, an innovative restaurant critic, a 
high-spirited social lion, a high-minded gossip columnist, a globe-trotting 
adventurer, a prolific author and an even more prolific lover, died 
in his home in Oxfordshire, England, on Nov. 14. It was the 72nd birthday 
of a man who had not so much suffered from, as gloried in, a lifelong 
affliction with muscular dystrophy. The son of a career diplomat and 
the grandson of a titled government official, Crewe stumbled resolutely 
through his first six years. Then he was examined by a doctor who 
told his mother that he had muscular dystrophy and would be dead by 
age 16. She, in turn, told young Quentin that he would be fine at 
16, which might explain why Crewe continued to stumble on with such 
heightened optimism. By the time he turned 16 and realized that his 
condition would only worsen, picking himself up had become so ingrained 
that he masked his disappointment by reveling in challenges for the 
rest of his life. Confronted, for instance, with a body so weakened 
that he could lift one hand only with the help of the other, his response 
was to peck out 11 books, several of them accounts of world travels 
undertaken specifically to demonstrate that his disability was not 
disabling. It was hardly a coincidence that the most strenuous of 
his travels, including a grueling trek through the uncharted wastes 
of the so-called empty quarter of Saudi Arabia in 1966 and an even 
more grueling two-year trek through the Sahara in the early 1980s, 
came after he was forced, at age 29, to start using a wheelchair. 
If he could not have accomplished his feats without assistance, Crewe, 
a man of captivating charm, never lacked for volunteers eager to push 
his wheelchair and to share his high-living company. During the heady 
1960s, for instance, when friends like Dudley Moore, Peter Sellers 
and Kenneth Tynan helped make his Belgravia apartment party central 
for Britain's smartest smart set, Princess Margaret once flew out 
by helicopter to help strip wallpaper in his country house and her 
husband, Lord Snowdon, made modifications to his wheelchair. An incurable 
romantic who claimed that he could fall in love over the course of 
a weekend and was forever doing just that, Crewe was married and divorced 
three times, always maintaining cordial relations with his former 
wives. He fathered six children, five of whom survive. A major theme 
of his life was established at Eton when he copied a fire door key 
and escaped for a rollicking day in London, an escapade that led to 
his expulsion. With the help of tutors he made it into Cambridge, 
but spent so much time partying that he was expelled for indolence, 
qualifying him for the life of a journalist. After a series of menial 
jobs, he broke into journalism in 1952 by writing reviews for The 
Times Literary Supplement, then won a free-lance assignment from The 
Evening Standard of London to investigate rumors that Aristotle Onassis 
was taking over Monaco. Typically, Crewe turned the assignment on 
its head, discounting the rumors but filing a humorous article that 
won him a full-time job. During a later journalistic stint, when he 
was sent to South Africa to report how conditions for blacks were 
improving, he wrote a series of articles on how they were actually 
getting worse. Although Crewe was proudest of his South Africa reports, 
his most significant contribution to journalism came while he was 
working for the magazine Queen in the 1960s. When the young woman 
assigned to compile the magazine's regular list of restaurants with 
one-line descriptions got sick, Crewe, who was on his way to lunch 
at a posh restaurant called Wilton's, volunteered to fill the space. 
His resulting review, suggesting that nursery food was served to aristocrats 
by waitresses dressed as nannies, created such a sensation that it 
has been credited with inventing modern British restaurant criticism. 
Later, as a gossip columnist for The Daily Mail, Crewe shunned items 
dealing with divorce, adultery, family disputes and the like, but 
failed to set a trend. His sense of decorum was reflected in his 1991 
autobiography, ``Well, I Forget the Rest,'' which noted that friends, 
marveling at his romantic conquests, were forever pestering him to 
give details of how a man in a wheelchair managed to perform. In a 
passage that can only seem mercifully reticent in an era of salacious 
excess, he wrote: ``I had no intention of enlightening them, then 
or now.''
