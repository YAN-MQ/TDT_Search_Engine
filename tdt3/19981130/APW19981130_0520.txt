India will put an advanced version of its nuclear-capable Prithvi 
missile on board fighting ships by next month, domestic news agencies 
reported Monday. United News of India and Press Trust of India quoted 
Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat as setting Jan. 26 as 
the deadline for arming an unspecified number of ships with the missiles. 
Jan. 26 is the national holiday on which India celebrates the day 
in 1950 when its constitution came into effect. India and neighbor 
and rival Pakistan both set off underground nuclear test explosions 
in May and declared themselves nuclear weapons powers. Analysts say 
the next step will be developing delivery systems for their weapons. 
India's two nuclear-capable missiles, the medium-range Prithvi and 
the long-range Agni, are expected to be the mainstay of its nuclear 
delivery system, according to Jane's Intelligence Review, a magazine 
that specializes in defense analysis. While the Agni is still in the 
development stage, India's Prithvi force is considered to be in the 
range of 20 to 50 missiles, Jane's says. India's Defense Research 
and Development Organization is also working on a submarine-launched 
missile called Sagarika, which could become operational by 2010, Jane's 
says. But Admiral Bhagwat was quoted by UNI Monday as saying India 
had no such project.
