Fifteen people drowned when they tried to cross a river to a gold 
mining site in central Vietnam, local police said Monday. The incident 
occurred last week when a boat and a makeshift craft carrying about 
30 illegal gold miners capsized in Quang Nam province, a police officer 
of Phuoc Son district said. In another incident, seven illegal gold 
miners died in Phuoc Son last week when their tunnels collapsed, the 
officer said. The army has been deployed to crack down on illegal 
gold mining in the district, but he said hundreds of miners still 
operate at the jungle site. Until last week, Quang Nam was suffering 
from its worst floods in more than 30 years, with 47 people dead and 
145 billion dong (dlrs 10.4 million) in damage, a huge amount for 
the poor province.
