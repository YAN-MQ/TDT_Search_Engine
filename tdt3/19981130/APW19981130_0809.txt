A parliamentary commission seeking to impeach Boris Yeltsin debated 
Monday whether the president, as commander-in-chief, was responsible 
for the stunning decay of Russia's once-mighty military. The president 
himself remained in a government hospital for the ninth straight day, 
receiving treatment for pneumonia _ the latest in a string of illnesses. 
Yeltsin received his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital, 
and the president's office said the 67-year-old Yeltsin was ``getting 
better.'' But he was still expected to stay in the hospital for several 
days. Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin, dressed 
in a white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pallid, listening intently 
to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin 
released in recent weeks, Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of 
the president speaking. Meanwhile, a parliamentary impeachment panel 
debated charges against Yeltsin but failed to reach a conclusion. 
Several lawmakers accused Yeltsin of neglecting the armed forces, 
but said it would be hard to prove it was a premeditated action, and 
therefore an impeachable offense. The panel set up last summer has 
already accused Yeltsin on three offenses they say are grounds for 
impeachment: instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, using 
force against lawmakers holed up in parliament in 1993, and launching 
the botched war in separatist Chechnya in 1994. Several previous impeachment 
attempts have failed and this one also appears to have little chance 
of forcing Yeltsin from office. But the Communists and their hard-line 
allies have been able to use the panel to keep up pressure on Yeltsin 
at a time when he has not been able to effectively govern. If a motion 
to impeach is put on the parliament's agenda, it would need a two-thirds 
majority approval in each of the two legislative chambers and an endorsement 
by both the Constitutional and Supreme Courts. Yeltsin's repeated 
illnesses and his infrequent appearances in the Kremlin have raised 
concerns about his ability to lead the country _ now mired in its 
worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse _ through the 
end of his term in mid-2000. Russian media has begun openly speculating 
on what would happen if Yeltsin does not last that long. ``What will 
happen if Yeltsin dies?'' the popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets 
asked Monday in a headline to a front-page analysis. It proceeded 
with gloomy predictions including a coup, secession by Russia's regions, 
and election victory by Communists and a return to the Soviet prison-camp 
system and an Iron Curtain. The Russian Constitution says that if 
the president dies or is incapacitated, the prime minister takes over 
for three months, at which point a new election must be held. But 
many believe the process would not be so smooth. ``We would have few 
chances to preserve our form of existence. Which way (the changes) 
would go is unclear, because that would already be beyond the threshold, 
on the other side, past the edge of the precipice _ and there is only 
pitch darkness there,'' Moskovsky Komsomolets said.
