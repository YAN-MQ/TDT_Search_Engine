Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom is likely to post losses of 
40 billion to 60 billion rubles (dlrs 2.7 billion to 3.3 billion) 
this year because of Russia's financial crisis, its chairman said 
Monday. Debts by gas customers, including thousands of state-run facilities, 
have soared since Russia's troubles came to a head in August. Cash 
collections by the world's largest gas company are as low as ``around 
20 percent,'' chairman Rem Vyakhirev told journalists. In September, 
the virtual collapse of the banking system brought all payments to 
Gazprom to a halt. The company, which is 40 percent owned by Russia's 
government, has also been hit by a sharp drop in world oil prices. 
Gazprom is Russia's largest company and accounts for as much as 8 
percent of the country's gross domestic product. Gazprom expects to 
produce 552 billion cubic meters (19.3 trillion cubic feet) of gas 
this year. Vyakhirev said its output would likely start falling next 
year because of the mountain of non-payments and the government's 
financial problems. In 1997, Gazprom posted a net profit of 38.7 billion 
rubles (dlrs 6.4 billion at January's exchange rate), though the results 
were based on Russian accounting standards, which differ significantly 
from international standards.
