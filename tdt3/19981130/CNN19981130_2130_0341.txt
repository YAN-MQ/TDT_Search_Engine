A new revelation about Iraq and the weapons program it isn't supposed 
to have. CNN has learned Baghdad has continued trying to build a better 
long-range missile, in violation of U.N. resolutions. Sources tell 
CNN a team of Iraqi missile engineers traveled to Romania in may to 
try to procure advanced missile guidance systems. Former U.N. weapons 
inspector Scott Ritter says intelligence agencies of three countries 
were watching the meeting. The covert surveillance was dubbed "operation 
teacup." The United Nations won't acknowledge the existence of the 
operation and the iraqi government has not commented.
