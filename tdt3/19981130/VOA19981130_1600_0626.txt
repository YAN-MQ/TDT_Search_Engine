Traffic flowed freely today near a check point of a NATO-led peacekeepers 
in Southern Bosnia after protesters removed road blocks overnight 
they had put up on Sunday. A crowd blocked the road at a check point 
at Massleen near Stolac Sunday to protest the detention of a Bosnian-Croat 
man by the peacekeeping force for carrying unauthorized ammunition. 
A statement from the peacekeepers said the local people removed their 
vehicles from the road near the check point as agreed, following a 
meeting with local authorities and the stabilization force. The area 
has been tense since fighting between Croats and Muslims during the 
1992 through '95 Bosnian war.
