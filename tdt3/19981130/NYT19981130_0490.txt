Coats with hems at the knee or slightly above are far and away the 
most popular this winter, probably because they look good with pants 
or skirts of so many lengths. Neiman Marcus has a high-collared coat 
in brown alpaca and wool by Searle ($895) and a zip-front hooded style 
in camel's hair and wool by Calvin Klein ($795). Barneys New York 
has three styles by Chaiken &AMP; Capone in black, camel or gray ($530 
to $580); a gray wool coat with white embroidery at the hem by Marc 
O'Neil ($635), and a double-breasted sueded gray wool by Jil Sander 
($2,500). Barneys Private Label offers three-quarter coats in black 
or camel cashmere ($1,250) or in red alpaca and wool ($875). Saks 
Fifth Avenue has a light blue double-breasted wool coat by Philosophy 
di Alberta Ferretti ($700) and styles in navy mohair and wool by Moschino 
Cheap and Chic ($1,000); black leather by Helmut Lang ($2,855), and 
beige shearling by Gucci ($3,315).
