A new U.N. report concludes that South Africa is suffering from one 
of the world's highest rates of new infection with the virus that 
causes AIDS. The study released Monday in Johannesburg says just South 
Africa alone accounts for more than half the new infections this year 
in Southern Africa, the world's worst area hit by the deadly disease. 
The head of the U.N. AIDS program says Southern Africa is facing an 
unprecedented catastrophe worst than apartheid, colonialism, or any 
natural disasters that have befallen that region.
