I'm Ladasta Hoke. It's now 2149 universal time. Here's the major story 
we're following this hour. President Clinton is urging increased financial 
aid for the Palestinians to support the peace process with Israel. 
We'll have an update on that story in about 11 minutes at 22 hours 
universal time. Right now, it's time for business news, and VOA's 
Elaine Johannsen has the latest from Wall Street.
