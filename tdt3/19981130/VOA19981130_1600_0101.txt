There is angry political debate in Israel over what the country should 
do in the face of increasing guerrilla attacks against troops in its 
South Lebanon security zone. But as correspondent David Gullis reports 
from Jerusalem, there are no signs of change in Israeli policy. A 
debate on Lebanon and Israel's inner Cabinet began Sunday night and 
will resume Wednesday, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says 
not one member is recommending a unilateral pull out despite Hezbollah 
guerrilla attacks that have killed seven Israeli soldiers in the last 
two weeks. Defense minister Yitzhak Mordecai says keeping the security 
zone is the only real option Israel has to fend off attacks from Hezbollah. 
We know that the Lebanon and Iran supporting Hezbollah and encouraging 
Hezbollah to continue to attack and to continue to damage any peaceful 
stability in the Middle East. But the defense chief came under attack 
from opposition Labor Party Knesset member Yosi Baylin who accused 
him of lying when he said there is a consensus among top generals 
to remain in Lebanon. David Gullis, VOA News, Jerusalem.
