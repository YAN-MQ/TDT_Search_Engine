Trying to deflect public criticism as casualties mount, Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday he sympathizes with the mother 
of every Israeli soldier but will not pull out of Lebanon without 
security guarantees. Israel's security cabinet met for four hours 
Sunday and heard briefings from military commanders about the escalating 
clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon. 
Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks while 
patrolling Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' inside Lebanon. 
As the security committee met at Netanyahu's office, opponents of 
Israel's occupation of south Lebanon demonstrated outside, chanting, 
``Lebanon is a disaster.'' Netanyahu said Monday he understood the 
protesters' concern. ``Our heart is with every mother and every person 
who has suffered'' because of Israel's military presence in Lebanon, 
he told Israel radio. However, he added that ``we have the responsibility 
to do the right thing for the state of Israel, not for the next newscast.'' 
Rejecting an unconditional pullout, Netanyahu said: ``I didn't hear 
a single minister say we should just tuck our tail and get out.'' 
He said his first priority is protecting the Israeli villages along 
the border with Lebanon. Other goals include reducing casualties among 
Israeli soldiers and to ``protect our allies,'' a reference to the 
South Lebanese Army, an Israel-sponsored militia that patrols the 
security zone alongside the Israelis. Opponents of an Israeli pullout 
warn that without Israeli patrols engaging Hezbollah inside Lebanon, 
the guerrillas would be free to attack Israeli border villages. Lebanon's 
government, demanding an unconditional Israeli pullout, says that 
if the Israelis leave, Hezbollah would have no reason to strike. Hezbollah 
refuses to give Israel any assurances. Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel 
Sharon has proposed that Israel pull its soldiers out of Lebanon gradually, 
while threatening to destroy Lebanese infrastructure if Hezbollah 
guerrillas continue their attacks. Public Security Minister Avigdor 
Kahalani agreed. ``Let Beirut wake up one morning without water and 
electricity and then, believe me, they (the Lebanese) will send forces 
(to restrain Hezbollah), and so will the Syrians,'' Kahalani said. 
In the Israel radio interview, Netanyahu did not refer specifically 
to Sharon's proposal, but observed, ``We have great power. We also 
have great wisdom. We should use our power wisely.'' The Israelis 
have charged that Syria is behind the escalation of Hezbollah attacks 
against Israeli forces, as a way of pressuring Israel. Until recently, 
Israeli policy held that Israel could not withdraw its forces from 
Lebanon in the absence of a peace agreement involving Syria. But the 
Syrians have made it clear that the price for such an agreement is 
return of all of the Golan Heights, strategic highlands overlooking 
Israel's north and captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's 
government rejects that.
