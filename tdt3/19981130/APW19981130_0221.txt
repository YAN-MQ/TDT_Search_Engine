The formation of a commission to look into corruption allegations 
against ex-President Suharto has been postponed because not enough 
people have agreed to join it, a senior Indonesian official said Monday. 
President B.J. Habibie had been scheduled to announce the commission's 
composition Monday. State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said 30 people had 
been invited to sit on the panel. ``But not all have replied,'' he 
told reporters at the presidential palace, adding that an announcement 
might be made in one or two days. Meanwhile, Suharto's legal adviser 
has warned that the government could be threatened if the former autocrat 
is made to face court charges for corruption. ``If Suharto does go 
to court, it could drag down the government, bringing senior incumbent 
and former officials _ as well as all the cronies suspected of accruing 
ill-gotten wealth _ into messy litigation,'' The Jakarta Post quoted 
Yohanes Yacob as saying. On Monday, about 200 students demanded that 
Suharto be put on trial. They marched toward Suharto's house in an 
affluent Jakarta suburb but were stopped by troops. Police and soldiers 
heavily guard his residence and have blocked protesters from marching 
there several times recently. The delay comes amid growing skepticism 
about the effectiveness of the inquiry, which the government has said 
will be conducted by a group of ``credible'' individuals. Akbar said 
the commission would have the power to examine Suharto's records over 
a three-month period so as to establish whether he had acted corruptly 
during 32 years in power. But it would not be authorized to search 
for money that Suharto allegedly stashed overseas. This would be done 
by police and the attorney general's office, Akbar said. Suharto, 
77, who had ruled the would's fourth most populous country with an 
iron hand since 1966, resigned in May amid widespread student protests 
and riots that claimed about 1,200 lives. Critics have since accused 
him of siphoning off state wealth to benefit his family's massive 
business empires. Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth 
at dlrs 4 billion. Some opponents claim it is many times that. Suharto 
has denied any wrongdoing and has stated that he will cooperate with 
any investigation into his affairs. He has also denied that he has 
hidden away a fortune in foreign banks. Habibie ordered the commission 
set up after an earlier investigation by Attorney General Andi Mohamad 
Ghalib failed to find any evidence against Suharto. Many rejected 
it as a whitewash. On Monday The Indonesian Observer newspaper quoted 
a former Suharto Cabinet minister as doubting the new investigation 
would uncover much. Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, an ex-environment minister 
who is now a vocal government critic, questioned the resolve of officials 
to investigate allegations against Suharto. He said many members of 
the government had ties with Suharto. ``How could these people possibly 
carry out an investigation? Be realistic,'' Sarwono was quoted as 
saying. ``It cannot be denied that there is a special link between 
the leadership of President Habibie and his predecessor,'' he said. 
Habibie is a longtime friend and former loyal subordinate of Suharto. 
He has repeatedly said that while his old boss should be investigated, 
any inquiry must be conducted in accordance with Indonesian law and 
be based on the presumption of innocence.
