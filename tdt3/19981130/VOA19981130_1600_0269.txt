A Russian businessman suspected of having a Moscow organized crime 
gang has gone on trial in Geneva amid unprecedented security. Sergei 
Mikhailov faces up to 7-1/2 years in prison if he's found guilty of 
belonging to a Moscow based criminal organization and of breaking 
Swiss property laws. The burly Russian arrived at the courthouse in 
Geneva in an armored Mercedes wearing a bullet-proof vest. The court 
was under camera surveillance and filled with police.
