On Dec. 13, Roger Berlind will put on a tuxedo for his 33d opening 
night in the 22 years since he left investment banking and became 
a producer, then he will take his aisle seat for ``The Blue Room,'' 
starring Nicole Kidman, which he helped import from London. It isn't 
excitement or nervousness Berlind feels in those moments when the 
lights dim and the curtain rises. It is relief. He knows there is 
nothing more he can do. ``I don't get carried away with opening night 
magic,'' he said. ``This is a business.'' As businesses go, producing 
on Broadway is increasingly risky. Shows are more expensive than ever 
to mount _ musicals can cost as much as $10 million _ and rarely do 
investors recoup, much less make a profit. Berlind is just one of 
many who risk fortunes on shows that are statistically more likely 
to fail than succeed. Theatrical producers come and go, particularly 
after confronting the reality of a show's punishing losses. Yet Berlind, 
68, has hung in there year after year, taking chances on plays because 
he believes in them and because he can afford to lose as often as 
he wins. And these days on Broadway, with the influx of large corporations 
like Disney and Livent transforming the business, that kind of individual 
risk-taking is increasingly rare. ``I don't think you're going to 
see the money that was lost by a Roger Berlind in the future,'' said 
John F. Breglio, an entertainment attorney and chairman of the Theater 
Development Fund. ``Who is going to lose the big money and really 
throw the dice?'' Monday the McCarter Theater Center for the Performing 
Arts and Princeton University announced construction of the Roger 
S. Berlind Theater, a 350-seat expansion of the McCarter made possible 
with a $3.5 million gift from Berlind. ``I'm doing this because I 
enjoy it,'' he said in a recent interview. ``There is not an activity 
I can think of that wouldn't be more remunerative. I know it's not 
worth it economically, but I love theater. It is addictive.'' With 
labor costs and ad rates increasing faster than inflation and ticket 
prices, Berlind said, as well as rising costs of theater rentals and 
lighting and sound equipment, the prospect of producing has become 
considerably more daunting. While Berlind's first show, the Richard 
Rodgers musical ``Rex,'' cost $800,000 in 1976, the producer said 
it would cost $10 million today. ``It's dicier and dicier,'' Berlind 
said. ``I think we really need to address the fundamental cost structure 
in a way that incorporates unions and guilds and makes everybody realize 
this is a golden age that's turning rotten.'' Berlind is a wealthy 
man but he would have been far wealthier had he not altered his course 
so drastically 23 years ago. He was one of the founders of the brokerage 
firm Carter, Berlind, Potoma &AMP; Weill, which eventually became 
Lehman Brothers Inc. Among his former partners are Sanford I. Weill, 
now the co-chairman of Citigroup; Arthur L. Carter, owner of The New 
York Observer; and Marshall S. Cogan, a businessman and art collector 
who once owned the restaurant ``21.'' On June 24, 1975, everything 
changed. Berlind went to the airport with his 2-year-old son to pick 
up the rest of his family _ his wife and three other children _ and 
the plane crashed, killing all of them. Berlind felt he had no choice 
but to start over. ``The whole idea of building a business and making 
money didn't make sense anymore,'' he said. ``There was no more economic 
motivation.'' Since then Berlind's many projects have included hits 
_ ``Amadeus,'' ``City of Angels,'' the revival of ``Guys and Dolls'' 
_ and about as many misses: ``Precious Sons,'' ``Getting Away With 
Murder,'' ``Elliot Loves.'' Berlind's co-producers often include Scott 
Rudin, the Shubert Organization, Robert Fox and ABC, although sometimes, 
as in the case of ``Getting Away With Murder'' by Stephen Sondheim, 
he goes it alone. ``If it's unlikely to be a success, I won't raise 
money,'' Berlind said. ``It's too much of a fiduciary obligation.'' 
Last year two big musicals he took to Broadway failed to recoup: ``The 
Life,'' which ran for just over a year, and ``Steel Pier,'' which 
closed after about three months, including previews. To trawl for 
material, Berlind sees about 100 shows a year in New York, in London 
and around the country. He goes to backer auditions for investors, 
meets with other producers, reads scripts. Sometimes he just writes 
a check, but he prefers a more active role, helping writers shape 
the material and directors come up with a concept and taking part 
in the mechanics like advertising and ticket sales. ``It's not as 
much fun when you have your nose pressed against the pane,'' Berlind 
said, ``and all the fun is happening on the other side.'' Others, 
like the late Jerome Robbins _ Berlind produced ``Jerome Robbins' 
Broadway'' in 1989 _ apparently found him more intrusive. ``Jerome 
Robbins, when you hired him, you knew your involvement would be minimal,'' 
Berlind said. ``He was hard to talk to and didn't take suggestions 
well.'' Berlind said he finally wrote Robbins a seven-page, single-spaced 
typed letter containing all his ideas for the show, and Robbins wrote 
him back saying simply: ``Thank you for your thoughts. I will take 
them into consideration.'' Berlind, who remarried 19 years ago, seems 
well liked in the theater world. People often refer to him as a gentleman 
and describe him as kind. They're also grateful that he has been willing 
to gamble so much of his own fortune on producing. ``Roger is an example 
of someone who came from another industry and didn't carpetbag on 
the theater,'' said Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the 
Nederlander Organization. ``He came and he stayed.'' Berlind's choice 
in plays, however, is not universally respected. Because his background 
is in finance and not the arts, some theater veterans say, Berlind 
does not have as reliable a gut feeling as, say, producers with more 
theatrical flair, like Cameron Mackintosh. They also say Berlind plays 
it safe by importing shows from London and does not take chances on 
new work. Berlind seems confident in his instinct but acknowledges 
some major mistakes. ``When I fall in love,'' he said, ``sometimes 
I let my judgment suffer.'' Despite his buttoned-down appearance and 
banker's reserve, he describes producing with passion. ``It's like 
life or death,'' he said. ``You're with a group of people so intensely 
that you tend to lose sight of what's important to the world. Everything 
comes down to making this show work. That's what makes it an amazing 
experience, and it's also what allows you to get in serious trouble. 
It's a very emotional product. You wouldn't feel that way if you were 
manufacturing shoes.'' At the same time, Berlind is no philanthropist. 
He is in this to make money, and the bottom line is his top priority. 
``Each production is designed to return a profit,'' he said. ``I never 
do anything when I think, `I'm only doing this for love.''' Plays, 
particularly musicals, can be years in the making, Berlind said. First 
he obtains the production rights, which can entail long negotiations. 
Then he hires his creative team: director, designers, choreographer. 
Finally, he moves on to auditions. ``At each of these steps you have 
to mentally _ in fact, rather specifically _ determine the cost factor: 
how is it going to impact your production budget as well as your operating 
budget,'' Berlind said. ``And the hope is that you can break even 
at a low enough number so that what you earn above that is sufficient 
to pay back the cost of a production and be running long enough after 
that to give a profit to the investors.'' It is the lack of this kind 
of watchfulness, Berlind said, that led to the trouble facing Livent 
Inc., the public production company founded by Garth H. Drabinsky, 
which is now in bankruptcy. ``I think it's a good case study in the 
need to control costs,'' Berlind said. ``While I admire Garth Drabinsky's 
creativity and passion very much, I think he didn't pay sufficient 
attention to the production costs and the operating costs.'' When 
he raises money from other sources _ people, Berlind said, ``in a 
position to lose 100 percent of their investment'' _ he always keeps 
those investors in mind. But ultimately, he said, because of the subjective, 
mysterious quality of what makes a hit, the result is out of his hands. 
``It's a little bit like wildcatting for oil: you can always hit a 
gusher and then not get paid for six dry holes,'' he said. ``Gushers 
are harder and harder to come by because the economics of the business 
have deteriorated so much.'' Even Tony Awards do not guarantee financial 
success, said Berlind, who has won nine of them. Last spring, for 
example, ``A View From the Bridge,'' for which he was a co-producer, 
won the Tony for best revival but never made its money back and closed 
after five months. ``It should have worked,'' Berlind said. ``There 
is no explanation for that.'' While he often sees the logic of the 
critics, Berlind said, there are some shows whose failure continues 
to mystify him, like ``Steel Pier,'' which he nurtured from the beginning. 
In a review in The New York Times, Ben Brantley said of the show, 
set in the world of marathon dancing in Atlantic City in 1933, ``The 
entire effort feels soft at the edges, and it never really finds its 
motor.'' Berlind continued: ``There was a miscalculation which we 
still can't identify _ why it didn't work. So you put a lot of your 
emotions into a project like that over a two-year or longer period 
and it all comes down to opening night, which makes it absurd.'' More 
and more, the absurdity of producing on Broadway makes Berlind ask 
how long he'll stick with it. ``It's something I ask myself all the 
time,'' he said. ``How joyous is it and is there any objective reason 
to continue doing this as being an independent producer becomes less 
and less rewarding?'' But ultimately, Berlind says, his heart wins 
out over his head. So his schedule remains full. This spring he is 
taking two consecutive plays to Broadway from London, Patrick Marber's 
``Closer'' and David Hare's ``Amy's View.'' And next season he plans 
to produce two musicals, a revival of ``Kiss Me Kate'' and the new 
Stephen Sondheim musical, ``Wise Guys.'' ``I've been saying for 10 
years, `This is it,''' Berlind said. ``And then I get seduced by a 
script or a production I see. And I want to do it.''
