However slowly or quickly the FBI and the registered gun dealers work 
out the Kinks in this new system, whatever loopholes get closed or 
stay open, the concern about violence using guns does not diminish. 
In Richmond, Virginia, they are embracing one set of federal gun laws. 
ABC's Barry Serafin tonight on "project exile." For years, Richmond 
has had an unsavory distinction. Its per-capita murder rate has been 
among the top five in American cities, but not any more. We see in 
Richmond a huge drop in the homicide rate overall and an even bigger 
drop in the gun homicide rate. Officials here have used a simple and 
effective tactic. Instead of using local laws, they are using federal 
firearms laws, federal prosecutors and federal courts because that 
makes it easier to crack down on criminals caught with guns. It is 
called "project exile." The process is swift, and the guidelines are 
tough. Most defendants, three out of four, are denied bail. And if 
convicted, they face stiff mandatory sentences in federal prison. 
They are, in effect, exiled from the community. Case in point -- darrick 
Holmes. Police found a small amount of marijuana and a loaded semiautomatic 
pistol in his car. His lawyer Peter eliades says, in state court, 
Holmes would have faced a Light sentence. Probably be looking at a 
period of probation and even a possible dismissal. But, under "project 
exile" -- You're looking at, in this case, a sentencing range of two 
to two and a Half years in a federal penitentiary. Since February 
of last year, more than 240 armed criminals have been removed from 
the community. The average sentence -- 55 months in prison. More than 
400 guns like these have been seized, and the annual murder rate is 
down more than 40%. To make sure that the message about "project exile" 
gets out, local businesses are paying for billboards and signs on 
a city bus. Criminals are getting the point. I've got the stuff. It's 
in his pocket. Now, police say, when making arrests, in this case 
-- a suspect with a pocketful of money and crack cocaine. They are 
finding fewer guns. Because lawbreakers know if they get caught with 
guns, they face a long stretch in prison. Barry Serafin, ABC News, 
Richmond. Other cities are expressing interest in the program and 
one, Rochester, New York, has already adopted "project exile."
