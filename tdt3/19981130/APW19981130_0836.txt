A century after Oscar Wilde was disgraced and jailed for a homosexual 
affair, Britain honored the eminent playwright Monday with the unveiling 
of a statue in central London _ depicting him with head in hands holding 
a cigarette. ``I think it is wonderful, a wonderful monument for the 
people of London and of England,'' said actor Stephen Fry, who played 
the central character in the film ``Wilde.'' ``Showing him smoking 
is yet again a big finger shoved in the face of society,'' Fry added. 
The statue near Traflagar Square is the first significant monument 
in the capital to Wilde, whose works, including ``The Important Of 
Being Earnest,'' still draw huge audiences. While hundreds of passersby 
stopped to listen, actors Dame Judi Dench and Nigel Hawthorne read 
an extract from Wilde's ``A Woman Of No Importance.'' Culture Secretary 
Chris Smith said Wilde ``challenged prejudice, he took on the Establishment 
and its perceptions.'' ``It's due to Oscar Wilde in many ways that 
we today can celebrate a society that generally appreciates diversity,'' 
added Smith, one of two openly homosexual members of Prime Minister 
Tony Blair's 22-strong Cabinet. Wilde was sentenced to two years jail 
in 1895 for homosexual practices revealed during a libel action against 
the Marquis of Queensbury, who had objected to Wilde's association 
with his son, Lord Alfred Douglas. Wilde died in exile in France in 
1900. The statue by sculptor Maggi Hambling is titled ``A Conversation 
With Oscar Wilde 1854-1900.'' It is inscribed with a Wilde quotation, 
``We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.'' 
Wilde's grandson, Merlin Holland, said he felt there was still some 
``discomfort'' in England about Wilde's homosexuality. ``But I think 
we're reaching a point where I hope ... we will regard him as a writer 
and his sexuality as his own affair,'' added Holland.
