Chile's foreign minister arrived in Madrid on Monday to press his 
case for having former dictator Augusto Pinochet face justice in Chile 
instead of Spain. ``The political climate in Spain is not favorable 
to Sen. Pinochet and that carries weight in the judicial process even 
beyond the will of the judges to be impartial,'' Jose Miguel Insulza 
told reporters after meeting with Federico Trillo, speaker of the 
lower house of Parliament. Upon arrival at the airport from London, 
Insulza said he didn't have ``any expectations'' from his two-day 
visit to Spain other than to gain information. Insulza spent four 
days in Britain trying to persuade Britain's Labor Party government 
not to extradite Pinochet to Spain to face charges of murder, torture 
and genocide during his 1973-1990 rule. Insulza maintained Pinochet 
may be tried in Chile if he is allowed to go home. On Tuesday, he 
meets with Foreign Minister Abel Matutes and Prime Minister Jose Maria 
Aznar. Aznar, speaking from Portugal, said Monday that his government 
will maintain its position of not interfering with the judicial process. 
``If the British government decides not to take into consideration 
Gen. Pinochet's extradition, the Spanish government will accept it. 
And if Britain extradites him, Spanish justice (the judicial system) 
has to deal with the case,'' Aznar said. British Home Secretary Jack 
Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to permit extradition proceedings 
to begin.
