When we come back, NBC news "in depth." Deadly impact. A season of 
killer hurricanes comes to an end. What does it mean for the winter 
forecast? You know, the last I looked, the average workday lasts more 
than a few hours, right? Right. But average pain relievers may work 
for a few hours then quit. Well, now there's aleve. Aleve's the one 
with the strength... to work on arthritis pain all day long with just 
two pills. It would take eight Tylenol to do that. So, if your pain 
reliever isn't putting in a full day's work-- fire it. Fire it. And 
take aleve. Two pills, all day relief. Works for me. Party of the 
first part did not intend-- I shoulda used preparation H. if you had, 
you wouldn't be suffering now. Preparation H helps stop itch and further 
irritation... with a soothing layer of protection. I shoulda used 
preparation H. The northstar system... performance and technology 
that set Cadillac apart from every other luxury car in the world. 
Now experience the difference during the Cadillac performance drive. 
With the 1999 Seville with the power and control of the northstar 
system, for just $549 a month. A powerful way, to set yourself apart
