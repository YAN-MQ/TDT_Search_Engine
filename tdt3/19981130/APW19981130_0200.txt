An outspoken human rights activist was arrested Monday, only minutes 
after he walked out of court after posting bail on another charge. 
Tian Chua, chairman of the opposition Coalition of People's Democracy, 
was picked up 10 days ago by plainclothes officers after police had 
dispersed an anti-government demonstration. The protesters were voicing 
support for ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, currently 
on trial on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct. Members of 
Tian's coalition, which is composed of 20 human rights and opposition 
political groups, have protested that he was beaten while in police 
custody. Tian was charged in court Monday with illegal assembly. His 
sister posted the 2,000 ringgit (dlrs 526) bail. As soon as he walked 
out of the courthouse, however, police placed him in handcuffs and 
put him into a waiting van. ``Continue the struggle!'' Tian shouted 
from the police van, his clenched fist held high. ``Long live the 
struggle!'' The police who arrested him Monday were from his Kuala 
Lumpur neighborhood of Petaling Jaya. Tian's attorney, Sivarasa Rasiah, 
said no reason was given for his arrest. He believes it may be related 
to documents taken from Tian's house when it was searched by police 
after his first arrest. ``What happened to him is an abuse of the 
police process,'' said Elizabeth Wong, coordinator of Malaysia's leading 
human rights group, SUARAM, a member of Tian's coalition. ``By re-arresting 
him, they are punishing him as well as prolonging his detention.'' 
Supporters who have held nightly vigils in front of the Campbell Police 
Station, where he was held until his arraignment Monday, said they 
would now stand vigil in front of the Petaling Jaya police station. 
Police have arrested more than 300 people at street rallies sparked 
by the Sept. 20 arrest of Anwar. Protesters have demanded political 
reforms and an end to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
