Some people are able to have a small glass of wine if they drink anything 
at all, and be satisfied with that. Others can consume large amounts 
of alcohol well into the night and hardly seem effected. Science Correspondent 
Jessica Berman reports on a study that appears in a recent issue of 
the journal nature, and it offers a tantalizing clue about why some 
individuals may become alcoholics. Researchers at the University of 
Washington in Seattle, focus their attention on a brain chemical called 
neuropeptide Y or NPY for short. NPY is one of a number of so-called 
neurochemicals that helps brain cells communicate with each others. 
It had been thought that NPY helps influence a person's tolerance 
to beer, wine, and spirits, whether they become a so-called tea totler 
or a veracious alcoholic. To find out, the researchers bred two groups 
of mice, those that produced a lot of NPY, and those that produced 
none of the brain chemical at all. Todd Thiel led the research team. 
And we found that when you eliminate NPY in these transjenic knockout 
mice, mice without any NPY drink significant more alcohol than a normal 
mice. These mice are also less effected by the sedative or sleep inducing 
effects of alcohol. Investigators observed an opposite effect in mice 
with high levels of NPY. It didn't take much alcohol to get them drunk, 
and the rodents took much longer to recover after a bout of drinking. 
Mr. Thiel says it's too soon to know whether varying amounts of NPY 
cause similar behavior in people. Now if this is true, that abnormal 
levels of NPY are in fact related to alcoholism in humans, then feasibly 
one could consider that it's possible that NPY compounds in the future 
may be useful for treating alcoholism. But again, a lot of research 
is necessary before we can really be safe in concluding that NPY might 
be useful in treating alcoholism. Mr. Thiel says future research on 
NPY might focus on specific brain regions where the neurochemical 
is most active. And he says that Scientists want to know why low levels 
of NPY lead to increased alcohol intake, while levels of the brain 
chemical appear to dampen the desire for alcohol.
