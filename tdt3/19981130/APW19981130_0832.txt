Randy Johnson, the most accomplished pitcher among this year's free 
agents in Major League Baseball, agreed Monday to a dlrs 53 million, 
four-year contract with the nascent Arizona Diamondbacks, The Associated 
Press has learned. Johnson, a left-hander who causes so much fear 
among some left-handed hitters that they take themselves out of games 
he pitches, also had been considering offers from three other North 
American teams, the Anaheim Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and Texas 
Rangers. While there was no immediate announcement of the deal, it 
was confirmed to the AP by a source familiar with the negotiations 
who spoke on the condition he not be identified. The Diamondbacks, 
a new team which will be in its second year next season, planned to 
announce the deal later Monday, the source said. By signing with Arizona, 
Johnson will be able to commute to half his games each season. He 
lives in Glendale, a comfortable driving distance from Bank One Ballpark 
in Phoenix. ``For us, it's obvious there are family issues, and he's 
pleased to spend his life in the Valley for hopefully the rest of 
his baseball life,'' Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, told radio station 
KMVP in Phoenix. ``But also from the top, we have a commitment that 
the Diamondbacks are going to do what it takes to get to the World 
Series and we believe that.'' The average annual value of his new 
contract is dlrs 13.25 million, the second-highest in baseball behind 
the dlrs 13.33 million Mo Vaughn will get under the dlrs 80 million, 
six-year contract he agreed to Wednesday with Anaheim. Johnson, 35, 
was 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA and 116 strikeouts in 84 1-3 innings this 
year for the Houston Astros, who acquired him from Seattle on July 
31. Unhappy with the Mariners after they refused to give him a contract 
extension after the 1997 season, Johnson had asked for a trade. When 
Seattle refused, he was grumpy all through spring training and the 
first half of the season, going 9-10 with a 4.33 ERA before Seattle 
dealt him just minutes before the trade deadline. In all, he struck 
out 329 this season, leading the major leagues. Johnson has a 143-79 
career record, striking out 2,329 in 1,978 1-3 innings. He joins an 
Arizona team that hopes to improve drastically from 1998, when the 
Diamondbacks went 65-97 in their initial season, finishing last in 
the NL West, 33 games behind the division-winning San Diego Padres.
