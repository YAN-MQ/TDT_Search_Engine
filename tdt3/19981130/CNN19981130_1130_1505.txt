Extravagant fabrics and lush patterns rule the runway in designer 
Han feng's latest collection. Elsa Klensch has a look. a love affair 
between a trader in fabrics and a young girl, traveling together along 
the ancient silk road to China. That's the fantasy theme in the fall/winter 
collection from New York designer Han feng. Feng says she's always 
been fascinated with the life of silk traders whose caravans connected 
the east with the west. Feng lines her runway with carpets to create 
the exotic feeling of the route. Started in Italy originally, and 
come to end all in China. So from Italy, Europe, to Spain, to Morocco, 
to north Africa, and then to india, then to China. So you feel everything. 
And so you got patterns in silk from Italy, from Morocco? Yes, from 
everywhere, so you can only feel it. You can feel this exotic woman 
and have mixed culture, but you don't know exactly. It's a little 
bit of everything, kind of. And everything's in silk? Most. Wool. 
A lot of wool, a lot of silk, a lot of lined in silk. Beautiful color. 
And the idea is a silk merchant traveled to different countries to 
have this romance, so young beautiful girl try to -- overdone a little 
bit with the jewelry, with beautiful fabric. They are looking forwards 
for life. And the clothes are also staged to everyday wear. The idea 
I want to make is normal people, basic people can see from runways 
and say, "I can wear it, I can understand it, too." Is evening important? 
Evenings are very important. The idea is how to make an everyday woman, 
the clothes, like a drawer, so beautiful. Make a career woman feel 
good about themselves. They should also look beautiful, too. That's 
Han feng with her fall/winter collection. Elsa Klensch, CNN, New York.
