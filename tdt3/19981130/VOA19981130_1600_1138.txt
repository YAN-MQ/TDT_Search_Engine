Also Sunday, the Superbowl champion Denver Broncos took another big 
stride in their march towards perfection. Quarterback John Elway tossed 
a season high four touchdown passes in the Bronco's 31 to 16 triumph 
over San Diego. The victory also gave Denver the AFC West Division 
title. The Broncos are the fourth team in NFL history to start the 
season with 12 straight wins. Elway says the pressure to go undefeated 
is building. There's no question the more you talk about it, the more 
the pressure builds. But, you know, I've thought about this. I think 
what was our goal when we came in this year and that was to win the 
Superbowl. So the bottom line is if we're to lost a football game, 
it better be in the regular season and not in the playoffs. The 1972 
Miami Dolphins are the only team to win the league title without a 
loss the entire season.
