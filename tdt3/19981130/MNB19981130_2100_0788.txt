Big national development we told but at the top of the broadcast. 
As of today, the federal Brady law requiring background checks takes 
a Whole new form. In its place is a new system that covers more kinds 
of guns. The F.B.I. hopes it will be faster, do a better job of stopping 
illegal gun sales. But as Pete Williams reports, on its first day, 
it's showing potential serious problems on both sides of the retail 
counter. Starting today for the first time, anyone wanting to buy 
a rival or shotgun must first undergo a background check. The new 
system poses a loophole because the old one covered only hand gns, 
but not long guns, which counted for half of the roughly three million 
new firearms sold each year. We hope to keep guns, both handguns and 
long barrel weapons out of the hands of persons who are not qualified 
to possess those weapons. Starting now, gun sales in pawn shops will 
also be covered. It's part of the new national instant check system 
for gun buyers. Computer checks of state and fefrl records done by 
the F.B.I. unless the state already has its own system. Half the states 
have opted to let the F.B.I. do all the checks in those states today, 
the system sometimes seemed anything but instant. Hello, how may I 
help you? It took gun dealer Mack Woods in Texas 2 1/2 hours this 
morning just to get through. It's busy, too In long island, New York, 
getting through was only half the problem. We're sorry, this is temporary 
out of service. Please try your call again later. While some dealers 
and buyers were complaining the law goes too far, others say it doesn't 
go far enough, since some states don't report all records of gun conviction, 
mental violence -- domestic violence or mental hospital convictions. 
Others say there ought be to a waiting period. Too many people purchase 
a gun in a moment of anger or despair, then use that gun to kill themselves 
or someone else. The F.B.I. acknowledges some start-up glitches. The 
federal law required it to start today in the middle of the hunting 
and christmas season. Pete Williams, NBC news, Washington.
