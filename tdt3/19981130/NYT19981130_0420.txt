Gen. Charles Krulak, the commandant of the Marine Corps, had just 
finished a long speech on ``moral courage'' at the Naval War College 
in Newport, R.I., when the inevitable question arose. What are the 
nation's military officers supposed to think, a young officer in the 
audience asked, when the commander in chief has acknowledged behavior 
_ an ``inappropriate relationship'' with a subordinate _ that would 
in all likelihood ruin their careers? Krulak's answer boiled down 
to this: The same Uniform Code of Military Justice that prohibits 
adultery, fraternization and lying about either also prohibits officers 
from using ``contemptuous words'' against the president. And every 
man and woman in uniform swears an oath to that effect, even if it 
means giving up the right to speak freely. ``You either obey your 
oath,'' he said, ``or you have the courage to resign.'' On Tuesday, 
Republicans leading the House's impeachment inquiry plan to call two 
retired officers to testify about what they say is the corrosive effect 
on military discipline of having a commander in chief who has admitted 
misleading the nation. But in his remarks in Newport and in an interview, 
Krulak suggested that the scandal had far less impact on the armed 
forces than Clinton's critics would have it. Marines, he said, have 
focused on their jobs, as they should, and not on any political process 
in Washington. Only a few Marines have spoken out on the presidential 
scandal. ``That is not to say we in the corps are naive enough to 
think people aren't talking about this,'' he said. ``Let me tell you, 
they talk about everything. I mean it's no different than any other 
place. The question is, Do they act on what they talk about? The question 
is, Does it undermine good order and discipline?'' To that, he emphatically 
answered no. ``I don't see that,'' he said. There are some in the 
Pentagon who think that if any officer was going to resign over Clinton's 
affair with Monica Lewinsky, it would have been Krulak, a decorated 
34-year veteran who has served as commandant since 1995. He is an 
outspoken defender of the military's values in general and the Marine 
Corps' values in particular, a conservative Christian who said he 
would quit if the Pentagon ever eased its unequivocal prohibition 
on adultery as some officials proposed earlier this year. ``Just about 
everything he says has a moral dimension,'' said one of his Marine 
colleagues, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, the commander of all American forces 
in Central and South America. But Krulak has neither spoken out on 
the scandal nor criticized the president, even as he preaches about 
the necessity of moral leadership in the armed services and warns 
against efforts by the civilian world to impose its values on the 
military. Instead, he draws a distinction between Clinton and the 
office he holds. It is the sort of ambivalence that officers in the 
Marine Corps and the other services often express when asked to comment 
on Clinton's personal lapses. ``When we raise our hand,'' he said, 
``we swear allegiance to the Constitution, not to a person, not to 
an institution, but to the Constitution.'' In Krulak's view, those 
officers who openly denounce the president demonstrate ``a remarkable 
weakness'' by violating Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice, which prohibits officers from publicly criticizing the president 
and other civilian leaders of the military. He said officers could 
no more decide which articles to abide by than soldiers in combat 
could decide which orders to follow. ``To sit there and try to have 
it both ways is a lack of moral courage,'' he said. ``If you have 
such strong feelings that you cannot obey your oath, then it is incumbent 
on you to get out of the military. Then you can say all you want. 
As long as you're in the military, you need to stick by your oath, 
because that is part of the Constitution and your willingness to pay 
allegiance to the Constitution is in fact the foundation of our military.'' 
There have been no mass resignations, but in the last month a small 
wave of public criticism of Clinton, mostly in articles and letters 
in magazines and newspapers, threatened to turn into a tidal wave. 
Krulak's deputy, Gen. Terrence Dake, took the extraordinary step of 
sending a memorandum to all of the Marine Corps' generals ordering 
them to remind their officers of the rule against ``contemptuous words.'' 
Earlier this month, one officer, Maj. Shane Sellers, received the 
military equivalent of a stern lecture _ though nothing more severe 
_ for writing a column in The Navy Times in which he referred to the 
president as an ``adulterous liar.'' Krulak said it was not clear 
to him that the column necessarily met the definition of ``contemptuous 
words.'' Of course, the armed services have had their share of embarrassing 
sex scandals, including the Navy's case last week against an admiral 
who was charged with steering $150,000 worth of contracts to a woman 
with whom he was having an adulterous affair. But some in Washington 
have darkly warned that the accusations against the president have 
somehow underscored a growing and dangerous gap between the unbending 
values of the military and the more tolerant views of society in general. 
Krulak said that gap had always existed, necessarily and beneficially. 
Whatever happens in the House's impeachment process, he warned that 
it would invite disaster to do anything to impose the civilian world's 
values on the military. ``There is a sense that, `look, society is 
changing and since you represent society, there's a great danger if 
you don't change with it,''' he said. ``I will only say that my sense 
of society is that society seeks institutions with standards. And 
the last thing society wants is the institution of the military to 
go down a slippery slope.''
