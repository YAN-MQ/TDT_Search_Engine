The defensive back, naturally, could not believe the call. ``You go 
back and get all the Hail Marys on tape, and I'll bet you my next 
paycheck that you would be hard pressed to find two with no shoving 
on it,'' said the Jets' nickel back Corwin Brown. ``There's shoving 
on every one of them. Give me a break, man.'' The quarterback, not 
surprisingly, argued that a pass into the end zone from the 26-yard 
line is no Hail Mary, and it was about time the man on offense got 
a last-second break. ``If it's pass interference, it's pass interference,'' 
Vinny Testaverde said. ``There's always a lot of bumping, and I always 
thought the refs ought to make that call.'' Get the picture? It is 
always a tossup as to which side of the official's judgment we are 
going to wind up on. Heads, we win. Tails, we whine. ``Don't get me 
into that one,'' Bill Parcells said, with no one around to call the 
Jets' coach for delay of opinion. ``I have never filed an official's 
report since 1983, and that's all I'm going to say about it. When 
I'm retired from the league, I'll have something to say about the 
officials.'' The rest of the country was not about to wait, after 
a long, contentious holiday weekend that produced several episodes 
of ref rage, and Monday's historic rule change that will now require 
an official to raise the existential question _ heads or tails? _ 
and receive an answer before he tosses his coin. The comically botched 
pre-overtime toss in Detroit last Thursday was the prelude to stunning 
end-game calls missed and made Sunday in New England, which helped 
keep the soon-to-be Foxboro ex-Pats in their divisional chase. While 
no one yet knows if this was good for the Jets, Keith Byars, the veteran 
fullback, said he couldn't remember a last-second call that bad. ``I 
would hope,'' he said, ``for instant replay.'' According to the replay, 
the Patriots' Shawn Jefferson was out of bounds for the 10-yard pass 
he caught at the Bills' 26 from Drew Bledsoe on fourth-and-9, with 
six seconds left and the Patriots trailing by 4 points. Bledsoe then 
somehow hit Terry Glenn in the chest, in the end zone, in a crowd. 
Glenn dropped the ball, but an official dropped a flag. The interference 
call against the Bills' Henry Jones set up Bledsoe's 1-yard touchdown 
pass to Ben Coates, and produced renewed calls for impeachment hearings 
against those enterprising souls who depart the conventional work 
force each weekend to become the National Football League's adjunct 
officials. ``These guys do a good job, mainly, but they're not involved, 
they're not there every day,'' Byars said. ``I said a few years ago 
I would like for us to have full-time officials. We're the only sport 
that doesn't have them.'' An excellent point, except for this: Did 
we not just finish a major league baseball season in which the unionized, 
full-salaried umpires were vilified as the worst plague on the pastime 
since the Black Sox scandal? And please tell me when anyone stood 
up recently and applauded the work of those abused arbiters of basketball, 
hockey, tennis, figure skating and any other sport whose winners and 
losers are often determined by educated guesswork. Brutal, gut-wrenching 
calls have always been part of sports, which have become more difficult 
than ever to officiate, with X-Ray Cam waiting to freeze-frame every 
painful miscall. Granted, some of these grandfatherly gents hanging 
on as N.F.L. officials can't dodge their own flipped coin, much less 
a snorting nose tackle. But then, a reasonable man in his prime can 
see that half the job is making the calls; the other half is avoiding 
one's death. In the era of performance enhancement, these players 
are increasingly pumped up by weights and dietary supplements and 
who knows what else? They hit harder, move faster and, as Parcells 
said, an entire season could come down to inches, split seconds, millions 
of dollars potentially risked on a single play. The intolerance for 
those who officiate is going beyond the point of being unfair. It 
is beginning to sound absurd. Couldn't the Bills have stopped the 
Patriots from the 1-yard line Sunday? Couldn't Pittsburgh have kicked 
off to Detroit and held its ground? The N.F.L. can go ahead and bring 
back instant replay, stretch out a game already too long. There will 
still be human error, which the best teams will continue to find ways 
to survive. ``Someone sees one thing and someone sees another,'' a 
shrugging Keyshawn Johnson said. ``There's good plays and bad, good 
calls and bad. Everyone's human.'' Amen.
