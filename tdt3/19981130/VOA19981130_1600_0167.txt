A Bosnian-Serb who calls him the Serb Adolf has gone on trial for 
genocide before the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. 
Guran Yelosich insists he is innocent of genocide because he says 
he had no intention of taking part in the systematic plan to eliminate 
the Bosnian-Muslim population. Lauren Comadeaux reports from the Hague. 
Just one month ago, Guran Yelosich stood before judges and a shocked 
public gallery admitting his guilt saying he wanted to save his soul. 
The 30-year-old Bosnian Serb pled guilty to 31 charges, including 
12 murders, four beatings, and stealing money from Muslims. The crimes 
took place in 1992 where hundreds of Muslims were held in the Serb-run 
Luka camps outside the Bosnian town of Birchco. Prosecutors say Yelosich 
held a position there, and they say he told his victims he came to 
Birchco to kill Muslims, bragging about the number he killed. But 
whether that adds up to genocide is another story. Yelosich may have 
pled guilty to specific murders, but he pled not guilty to genocide. 
That's the most serious charge against him, the charge that means 
he systematically killed Muslims with the intention of destroying 
a significant part of their community. Lauren Comadeaux for VOA News, 
the Hague.
