WORLD. Remember to join us anytime online at www.theworld.org. You're

Comcast supports 91 FM, WHYY. I'm Lisa Mullins. Still to come on THE 
WORLD, as London weighs the fate of Augusto Pinochet, one Chilean 
politician says her country has higher priorities. Many Chileans here

First, this news. For THE WORLD, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC 
News in London.
