The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 1: A new national 
computerized system for conducting instant background checks of prospective 
gun purchasers went into effect yesterday. The rules for the new ``instant 
check'' system call for the FBI to conduct background checks before 
the sales of all firearms, not just of handguns, the previous focus 
of concern. This broadened coverage is potentially a big advance for 
public safety. But gun control advocates are correctly worried that 
the mandatory ``cooling off'' period previously required before a 
purchaser could take possession of a gun is expiring with the beginning 
of the federal background checks. The new system has limitations that 
could allow convicted criminals, the mentally ill or other prohibited 
purchasers to walk out of a store with a weapon. Some states will 
continue to check their own files. But for now, at least, the more 
than 500 people hired by the FBI to field calls from the nation's 
gun dealers and pawnshop owners lack immediate access to some critical 
state and local records, including involuntary admissions to mental 
hospitals, domestic violence misdemeanors and arrests too recent to 
be in the computer. A minimum three-day waiting period makes sense 
to give local police time to participate in the background search 
and to defuse impulse crimes of violence. Congress, which eliminated 
the waiting period as a gift to the gun lobby, ought to promptly reinstate 
it.
