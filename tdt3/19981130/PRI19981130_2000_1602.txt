Two banking unveiled details of a merger today. Germany's Deutsche 
Bank will pay $10.1 billion to buy Bankers Trust of New York, the 
eighth largest bank in the United States. Liz George has details now 
from our business desk in New York. The takeover by Germany's Deutsche 
Bank will create the world's largest bank, but it will also lead to 
job losses in the U.S. and Europe. The cuts will hit in areas in which 
the banks overlap, particularly in the trading rooms dealing in bonds 
and shares and among information technology staff. It's expected that 
around 5,500 jobs will go. Sean Ryan, the associate director of Basterns. 
Well, they've announced job cuts, but don't appear terribly heavy 
and don't appear too out of line with what you would expect. You know, 
with Bankers Trust headquartered here in New York, obviously there's 
not an enormous amount of overlap. Clearly there's going to be some 
back office consolidations. You expect some cuts there. And then also 
in selected business lines, you know, you would expect here in the 
U.S. where Bankers Trust has more heft, there might be some layoffs 
in Deutsche's executive ranks. And conversely in Europe, where Deutsche's 
is the larger entity, you might see the layoffs coming from the Bankers 
Trust side of things. The takeover enables Deutsche Bank to fulfill 
its dream of a sizable presence in the United States. The world's 
biggest and most innovative market for capital, and it comes at a 
time when many U.S. banking shares are bargain basement prices. Sean 
Ryan again. A lot of U.S. banks were pummeled from July through October. 
While a lot of them have bounced back, a lot haven't. And so both 
money centers and regional banks, you have a lot of them at bargain 
basement prices, and then you have a lot of others that have bounced 
back. So it's interesting. You have this bifurcation of bank valuations, 
many at the high end of the valuation ranges, many at the low end 
of their valuation ranges. And so that's the circumstance that you 
might expect would lead to another state of bank mergers. The acquisition 
is still subject to a vote by Bankers Trust shareholders, as well 
as having to meet regulatory approval in the U.S., Europe, and Germany.
