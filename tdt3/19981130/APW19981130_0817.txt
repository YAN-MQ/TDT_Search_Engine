Israel and the Palestinians accused each other of gravely violating 
the latest Mideast peace accord Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu warning he could walk away from agreements altogether. Netanyahu 
said statements by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on his plans for 
independence next May were ``serious and insufferable.'' Palestinian 
negotiators dismissed Netanyahu's threats and said continued Jewish 
settlement activity with Israeli government support, was destroying 
chances for peace. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative 
Council said at the end of a special session of parliament Monday 
that the council would ``confront settlement activity by all possible 
means.'' ``We cannot continue to say that there is a peace process 
while settlement expansion exists,'' Qureia told reporters. He suggested 
the Palestinians would not participate in negotiations for a final 
peace treaty unless Israel stops expanding Jewish settlements in the 
West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War 
and the Palestinians want for a future state. Netanyahu opposes Palestinian 
statehood and has warned that he would counter any statehood moves 
by annexing large chunks of West Bank land still under his control. 
As part of the land-for-peace agreement signed by Netanyahu and Arafat 
in Washington in October, Israel has begun withdrawing troops from 
13 percent more of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security 
measures against terror groups. Monday, the militant Palestinian group 
Islamic Jihad announced that one of its leaders, thought to have masterminded 
a car bombing last month, had been arrested by Palestinian intelligence. 
The Palestinians say the peace agreements do not prevent Arafat from 
declaring statehood on May 4, 1999, the day the five-year period of 
Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip ends. Palestinian 
negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians are paying no heed 
to Netanyahu's threats. ``Let him shout as much as he pleases,'' Asfour 
said of the Israeli leader. Sunday, Arafat said in Washington that 
``I hope that this (coming) year will be the year of the independent 
Palestinian state.'' Such a move would lead to the ``collapse,'' of 
the peace accords, Netanyahu's office said in a statement. A dispute 
over the release of Palestinian prisoners is also plaguing relations 
between the sides. As part of the accord, Israel agreed to free 750 
Palestinian prisoners. In the first stage, Israel released 250, most 
of them criminals, prompting Palestinian complaints that the agreement 
was breached. The Palestinians demand that Israel free Palestinians 
jailed for political and militant activity. Chief Palestinian negotiator 
Saeb Erekat said the prisoner issue had led to a crisis situation 
and he flew Monday to Washington to raise the issue with U.S. administration 
officials. Implementation of the peace accord would be difficult to 
continue under the present circumstances, Erekat said. However, Netanyahu 
said he would not compromise. ``I do not free murderers. I do not 
release people with blood on their hands,'' he told Israel radio. 
In another possible point of contention, Israeli Foreign Minister 
Ariel Sharon appointed low-level officials to negotiate an additional 
Israeli troop pullback with the Palestinians. However, Israel's Cabinet 
has already decided that it would hand over no more than 1 percent 
of the West Bank in an upcoming troop withdrawal. The junior appointments 
are ``just another example of Israel's lack of seriousness in implementing 
the agreement,'' said Asfour.
