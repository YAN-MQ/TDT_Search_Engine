In the wake of suggestions of widespread drug use in rugby union, 
the head of next year's World Cup on Monday promised tough measures 
to combat doping. ``The IRB (International Rugby Board) is due to 
review procedures for drug testing early next year and rugby World 
Cup will implement the procedures set down,'' said Paul Thorburn, 
head of next fall's championship. ``Rugby World Cup is conducting 
quite an in-depth doping control program during the qualifying tournaments 
and the competition itself.'' In the Sunday Times newspaper, former 
Wales and British Lions star J.P.R. Williams said drug abuse was common 
in the sport. ``It is fairly well recognized that certain players 
have been on anabolic steroids and haven't been tested,'' Williams 
was quoted as saying. The newspaper, citing lax drug-testing, said 
250,000 players turned out last season for English club games and 
that only 65 drug tests were given. ``In all sports, there are some 
people who are prepared to take the risk but we hope that rugby players 
will be sufficiently warned off so as not to take drugs,'' Thorburn 
said. ``But there's always going to be a problem, especially when 
there's money involved in the sport.'' The World Cup will be held 
Oct. 1-Nov. 6 in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and France.
