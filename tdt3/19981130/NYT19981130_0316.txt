Dr. Carl Sagan's legacy lives on in the popularization of science 
as well as in the practice of it. For instance, Bill Nye, ``the science 
guy'' who is the host of popular science television programs for children, 
took an astronomy course from Sagan at Cornell University and consulted 
with him after graduation on how to shape a science-communications 
career. ``He used to come into class with astonishing pictures from 
Mars,'' Nye recalled. ``He made quite an impression on me.'' The Planetary 
Society, a group in Pasadena, Calif., that promotes space exploration 
and publishes a bimonthly magazine, The Planetary Report, was founded 
in 1980 by Sagan and two other scientists, Bruce Murray and Louis 
Friedman, who are still advancing the cause. ``He had an enormous 
influence,'' said Murray, a planetary scientist at the California 
Institute of Technology. ``He was such an extraordinary communicator 
and popularizer.'' Many writers claim to have been touched by Sagan, 
including his son, Dorion, a science journalist and the co-author, 
with Lynn Margulis, of ``Microcosmos'' (Summit, 1986), ``Garden of 
Microbial Delights'' (Kendall-Hunt, 1995), ``What is Life?'' (Simon 
&AMP; Schuster, 1995) and ``What Is Sex?'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 
1997). Ms. Margulis is a biologist at the University of Massachusetts, 
Sagan's first wife and Dorion Sagan's mother. Sagan's closest literary 
collaborator was his third wife, Ann Druyan, a novelist who worked 
with him on ``Contact'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1985) and wrote with 
him ``Comet'' (Random House, 1985), an overview of what science knows 
about these icy visitors from outer space, and ``Shadows of Forgotten 
Ancestors,'' (Random House, 1992), a look at human origins. Ms. Druyan 
said she is working on several science films and television shows. 
She also gives talks and advises charitable groups. On Nov. 17, she 
spoke at Washington National Cathedral on what science knows about 
the cosmos. ``Among the things he gave me was a deeper respect for 
truth,'' she said in an interview. ``You have to have rigor and discipline, 
and he helped me develop that. I absolutely maintain that the closer 
you got to Carl, the more impressive he was, unlike some public figures. 
Knowing him was the signal honor of my life.''
