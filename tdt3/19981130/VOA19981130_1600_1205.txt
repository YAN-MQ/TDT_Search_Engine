In the other kind of football, that is what we call soccer, the Italian 
club, InterMilan has fired head coach Luigi Simone. The news came 
hours after Simone was named coach of the year by the Italian Soccer 
Federation. Club officials could not be reached immediately for comment, 
but the Italian news agency quoted Simone as saying he is very disappointed 
and did not at all expect this move. Simone took over InterMilan in 
mid-1997 from Englishman Roy Hodgson. He led the club to the UAFA 
cup title, but Inter is currently tied for sixth place in the 18th 
team Italian league. After a second place the league finished last 
season, club owner Massimo Marate made it clear he would settle for 
nothing less than the franchise's first league title since 1989. He 
has spent millions of dollars to sign such stars as Brazil's Reynaldo, 
Italian Roberto Baggio, France's Yori Jorkov, and Argentina's Diego 
Simeone.
