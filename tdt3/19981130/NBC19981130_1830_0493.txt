Wall Street investors return from the Thanksgiving weekend still hungry 
for some profits. That sent stocks down today. The Dow dropped 216.5 
points, erasing last weeks big gains. The NASDAQ took a big hit in 
a sell-off of technology stocks, down nearly 67 points. Joining me 
once again for some perspective on all this, CNBC's Ron Insana. Ron, 
what happened today? As you said the profit taking was one of the 
reasons the stock prices pulled back. We also saw some of the big 
winners of the recent move, the technology issues take a beating. 
But it was the Internet stocks that came, not crashes, but falling 
back to earth today. Some of them decimated. Amazon.com, one of the 
biggest winners down sharply today. Fallowed by Yahoo. That one was 
down hard. Ebay, this is a stock that went public two months ago, 
traveled to heights and pulled back sharply. You had to that a company 
called onsale that sells computer merchandise took a pounding. To 
give you an illustration on what took place, one company that we profiled, 
didax, a company that sells Christian music on the web, traveled to 
a high of 40 in early minutes of trading and then pulled back to 14 
3/4. Ron, how do these stocks get so high? A couple of reasons. Our 
players are trying to get a piece of the future of American business. 
They've been willing to pay any price to do it. What Les has been 
going on is that some investors borrow their money from the brokerage 
houses that they do business with to buy Internet stocks, basically 
taking out a credit line. Today, as my colleague reported, some of 
the big houses are cutting the credit lines to those speculating in 
Internet stocks. That's like having a Las Vegas casino cut your winnings. 
Thanks very much. Ron Insana with an aangie of what was going on in 
the stock market today.
