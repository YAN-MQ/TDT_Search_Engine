An immigrant from the Dominican Republic who has quietly run a Bronx 
liquor store for the last few years has been indicted on charges that 
he carried out a politically motivated killing of a journalist in 
his native country 23 years ago, federal authorities said Monday. 
The man, Mariano Cabrera Duran, 49, was arrested Saturday evening 
at his store, M &AMP; N Wines and Liquors, by federal marshals and 
New York police officers at the request of the Dominican authorities. 
According to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court on Nov. 28, 
the Dominican authorities said Cabrera was ``one of the persons that 
shot and killed'' Luis Orlando Martinez Howley in Santo Domingo on 
March 17, 1975. Martinez was a journalist who wrote articles critical 
of President Joaquin Balaguer, now 92, who left office in 1996 following 
international pressure and allegations of vote fraud in his 1994 election 
victory. Balaguer was long accused of human rights abuses and corruption, 
and three lawsuits in November 1996 charged that he misappropriated 
at least $740 million in government funds and ordered the killing 
of two opponents, including Martinez. The federal complaint said Cabrera 
was implicated as long ago as Oct. 29, 1975, when he admitted participation 
in the killing to a military board of inquiry. Later that year, three 
other men _ Joaquin Antonio Pou Castro, Rafael Alfredo Lluveres Ricart 
and Luis Emilio de la Rosa Beras _ also accused Cabrera, but he was 
allowed to immigrate to the United States in 1983. The bullet that 
killed Martinez was traced by the Dominican authorities to a .38-caliber 
revolver assigned to Cabrera while he served in the Dominican Air 
Force, the federal complaint said. Cabrera retired with the rank of 
sergeant in 1983. Cabrera's lawyer, Antonio Martinez of Manhattan, 
said Monday night that the federal complaint, which outlines the Dominican 
authorities' grounds for extradition, was ``not very specific.'' He 
said his that client has a wife in the United States and four children, 
three of whom are in the Dominican Republic, and that Cabrera has 
never been arrested in the United States or the Dominican Republic. 
Cabrera has legal residence in the United States and has traveled 
without restriction to the Dominican Republic, Martinez said. ``Based 
on what he has told me, my client is innocent,'' Martinez said. `` 
Cabrera has no motive in this affair. Whatever he did, he would have 
to do under orders from the military.'' Martinez said he was not acknowledging 
any role of his client's in the killing. On Monday night, a woman 
at the liquor store at 550 East 180th Street, who residents said they 
thought was Cabrera's wife, hung up when reached by telephone and 
ordered a reporter who later went to the store to leave. Ramon Rojas, 
44, the manager of the grocery store next door, said he did not know 
Cabrera well, but said to his knowledge, ``He's never been in trouble.'' 
He added that when federal marshals and police officers burst into 
Cabrera's store on Saturday, ``I thought it was city permits or immigration 
or something. I don't know.'' ``My client is the victim of a political 
show,'' said the lawyer, Martinez. He noted that Balaguer was succeeded 
by Leonel Fernandez Reyna, who is critical of Balaguer. ``My man is 
a very little fish in this political struggle in the Dominican Republic.'' 
Cabrera is being held without bail by federal authorities. A hearing 
has not been scheduled, Martinez said. Last month in Santo Domingo, 
Balaguer was called to testify at the trial of former military officers 
accused of killing Martinez, the journalist. In an autobiography in 
1988, Balaguer said he knew more about the Martinez killing, but he 
inserted a blank page at that point. He said he had left the relevant 
information with a friend, ``who has been instructed by me to make 
it public some years after my death.''
