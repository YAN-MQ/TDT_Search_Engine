The question on almost every trader's mind after Deutsche Bank AG 
announced its $10.1 billion acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp. on 
Monday was ``Who's next?'' The stock market was already rife with 
rumors last week about which companies were candidates. On Friday, 
shares in Dresdner Bank AG of Germany climbed 7.2 percent to a 12-week 
high, fueled by speculation that it was in talks with Credit Suisse 
Group about a possible combination. Executives from Credit Suisse 
declined to comment Monday. Traders were speculating, too, that something 
was up at ABN-Amro of the Netherlands, which analysts said has been 
shopping for a partner in the United States. And on Friday, Martin 
Taylor, chief executive of Barclays PLC of Britain, resigned, which 
some analysts said left the banking concern vulnerable to a takeover. 
But the key to any successful merger going forward, analysts agree, 
is banks combining asset management, commercial banking and corporate 
advising under one roof. The Deutsche Bank acquisition of Bankers 
Trust, in particular, said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill 
Lynch, ``forces a whole range of strategic rethinking in Europe.'' 
In Europe, commercial banks have been slow to move into asset management 
and investment banking, unlike their U.S. counterparts, and analysts 
expect more European banks to search for partners in those areas. 
But cultural conflicts and varying tax and accounting rules make any 
intra-Europe mergers challenging at best. Besides, many European concerns 
are looking to the lucrative U.S. market to expand their businesses. 
``The key is to have size, scale and a wide range of products,'' said 
Michael Mayo, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. That 
is so they can better serve their clients, which themselves are going 
global. Over the long term, the trend is to be a global adviser ``so 
you can better serve multinational corporations,'' Mayo said. Several 
U.S. banks and brokerage houses have long been considered acquisition 
targets. J.P. Morgan, for one, is thought to have rebuffed Deutsche 
Bank. ``But it is not immune,'' Kraushaar said. ``J.P. Morgan is stuck 
between smaller companies'' and larger firms. Earlier this year, the 
company embarked on a cost-containment effort to save money. And J.P. 
Morgan has been an active adviser to merger candidates themselves, 
most recently to Exxon Corp., which has been in talks to acquire Mobil 
Corp. Several other companies' names were rumored to be interesting 
candidates, including Lehman Brothers and the brokerage firms Donaldson, 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Paine Webber Inc. And Chase Manhattan Corp., 
which approached Merrill Lynch at one point, is thought to still be 
looking. ``A lot of it is hype, but it's not completely wacky,'' said 
an investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``You 
wander around the marketplace and you look at all the options. Now 
people are playing the matching-the-name game.''
