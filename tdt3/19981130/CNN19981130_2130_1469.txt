The head of universal pictures is calling it quits. Chairman and CEO 
Casey silver resigned today becoming the second high-ranking casualty 
at the company in two weeks. The move follows a disappointing debut 
of universal's newest film "babe: pig in the city." The movie wasn't 
finished in time which forced universal to cancel some important publicity 
events. The studio hasn't had a strong hit in about a year.
