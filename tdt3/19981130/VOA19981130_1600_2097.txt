The countdown is underway for the U.S. space agency's first launch 
for the international space station. The Space Shuttle Endeavour is 
due to lift off early Thursday morning from Cape Canaveral, Florida 
with five U.S. astronauts and one Russian Cosmonaut. The crew in a 
series of complicated maneuvers and space walks will attach the U.S.-built 
unity module to a Russian-built component that was launched ten days 
ago. Over the next five years, U.S. shuttles and Russian rockets will 
carry out 45 missions to assemble the station, an outpost for research 
and platform for space exploration.
