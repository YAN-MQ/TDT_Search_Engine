"CNN Headline News " I'm Lynne Russell. We begin with several important 
developments in the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton. 
CNN has learned the house Judiciary committee is expanding its inquiry 
to include allegations of campaign finance violations by the administration. 
Sources say the republicans plan to subpoena documents relating to 
the justice department investigation. Tomorrow, the committee is scheduled 
to vote on whether to subpoena attorney general Janet Reno, FBI director 
Louis freeh, and justice department prosecutor Charles LaBella. Reno 
did not follow freeh and LaBella's recommendation to appoint an independent 
counsel to investigate the allegations. In another development, White 
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said President Clinton probably 
won't accept an invitation to testify at the impeachment hearings. 
That sparked criticism from the chairman of the committee. Henry Hyde 
has indicated he is not pleased with the answers the president gave 
to 81 questions sent to him by the committee. Hyde says Mr. Clinton 
"has made it very clear he is going to stick with his reliance on 
bizarre technical definitions and legalistic defenses." The committee 
also wasn't able to get more information from democratic fund-raiser 
Nathan Landow today. Sources say he invoked his fifth amendment right 
against self-incrimination when he was asked about Kathleen Willey. 
Investigators suspect Landow may have tried to persuade Willey not 
to testify against the president in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
