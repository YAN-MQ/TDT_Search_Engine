The Baltimore Ravens fought back from a 10-point deficit in the 4th 
Quarter to beat the visiting Indianapolis Colts 38-31. The game had 
special significance for the Baltimore fans. It was the first time 
the Colts have returned to Baltimore since the Franchise deserted 
the city in 1984 and became the Indianapolis Colts. Raven's Quarterback 
Jim Harball who used to play for Indianapolis says Ravens' fans don't 
hate the Colts. It's not that the Baltimore fans hate Indianapolis, 
or hate the Colts. They were hurt that their team left but they have 
another team now. And hopefully they can be proud of us, and give 
them something to be proud of. And hopefully today was a step towards 
that.
