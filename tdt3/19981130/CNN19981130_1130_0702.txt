Every year, more than 1.5 million Americans suffer a traumatic brain 
injury. Half of those injuries are caused by vehicle crashes. Sports, 
falls and domestic or street violence are also responsible. Brain 
injuries range from severe, to so mild, they go unnoticed. But eventually, 
most victims experience symptoms, including disorientation, headaches, 
memory loss and personality changes. Experts say physical therapy, 
computerized memory exercises and other devices help. For example, 
if a person has very significant memory problems, then we try to help 
them figure out ways to take or use other reminder strategies. The 
goal is to boost self-confidence, and ultimately, enable people with 
brain injuries to return to work. For the latest health news online,
