Get ready for some serious snooping. Today's geography quiz takes 
us on the trail of one of the most beloved comic strip characters 
in all of Europe. Actually, we're looking for the birthplace of Tin-Tin, 
that intrepid reporter famous for his trademark cowlick and his faithful 
sidekick, his dog, Meloo. Although Tin-Tin and Meloo have traveled 
from Mongolia to Moscow to Mexico on their adventures, their creator, 
George Ramiyor Erjay, as he is popularly known, got his start in this 
European capital. The city is officially bilingual. You could speak 
either French or Flemish here, but you probably have more luck if 
you stick to the French. It's home to many national and multi-national 
corporations, the European Union, and NATO. So where are we and why 
all the fuss about Tin-Tin today? We'll have both answers coming up 
in just a few minutes.
