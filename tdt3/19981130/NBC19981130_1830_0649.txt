But when it comes to your tax the Internal Revenue Service is under 
fire for being too cavalier. Despite claims that the agency is becoming 
more user friendly, you may be shocked at how "your money" is being 
handled and just who is doing the handling. Here's NBC's Lisa Myers. 
How to move hundreds of millions of tax dollars. An armored truck? 
Or a bicycle messenger? Believe it or not, the IRS gave your checks 
to the messenger. They had a bicycle courier coming to a district 
office and that courier took deposits anywhere from $1 million a day 
to a $100 million a day to the depository institution on a bicycle. 
Surprised? So were investigators for Congress' general accounting 
office, who expected to find armored cars pulling up to IRS offices. 
Instead, they found unarmed couriers delivering hundreds of millions 
of dollars in checks. One actually left $200 million in checks in 
his unlocked car. And that's just one reason a new Gao report concludes 
that IRS internal controls still are "not adequate to sufficiently 
ensure that cash and checks were properly credited to taxpayer accounts 
and deposited to the treasury." This is an agency that is still is 
not paying attention to the interests of the people who do the work 
and pay the taxes in this country. For example, it turns out that 
some of the 20,000 seasonal workers hired last spring to process your 
tax returns and your hard-earned checks and cash had criminal records. 
How could that happen? Because the IRS put them in sensitive positions 
before background and fingerprint checks were done. During one recent 
period, 15% of thefts investigated by the IRS were committed by temporary 
employees whose criminal records weren't known before they were hired. 
One IRS worker reportedly stole almost $5 million in checks and tax 
returns, which went to an organized crime ring, which, duplicated 
the checks and stole the taxpayers' identities to commit more fraud. 
No one knows just how much gets stolen every year. The IRS says it's 
working hard to correct problems. I'd like to assure the taxpaying 
public that the IRS is serious on protecting their information and 
the receipts they submit to the IRS. But for now, critics say, the 
IRS seems more concerned with getting "your money" than protecting 
it. Lisa Myers, NBC news, Washington.
