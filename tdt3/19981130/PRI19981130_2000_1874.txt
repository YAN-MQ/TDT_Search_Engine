Turkey's powerful Army has sent a warning to the country's politicians: 
Quit speculating and form a government. The comments are though to 
be aimed at a Turkish Islamic leader who claims to have the Army's 
backing in his attempt to become prime minister. With more, here's 
Chris Morris. The brief statement issued by the general's staff said 
politicians must act with great care during negotiations to form a 
new government. They should avoid statements, it said, which could 
get the armed forces involved in politics. The statement said the 
military does not favor one party over another. It is common knowledge, 
however, that the high command distrusts the Islamist movement and 
sees itself as the guardian of Turkey's strict secular system. Chris 
Morris, BBC News, Ancora.
