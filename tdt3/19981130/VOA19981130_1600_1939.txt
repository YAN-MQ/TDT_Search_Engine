The genocide trial of Bosnian Serb suspect, Geran Yelsitch has opened 
before the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. The 30-year-old 
defendant is charged with killing numerous Bosnian Muslims and Croats 
in 1992. He has confessed to 12 murders but says he is innocent of 
genocide. However, prosecutor Terry Bauers told the three-judge tribunal 
the defendant once boasted that he had to kill 20 Muslims before drinking 
his morning cup of coffee.
