Yielding to a stream of complaints from patients who say they were 
illegally denied emergency care, the Clinton administration told hospitals 
Monday that they must examine and stabilize patients without any delays 
to ask about insurance coverage. A 1986 law prohibits hospitals from 
rejecting or ``dumping'' patients who request care in emergency rooms. 
But consumer advocates say the law was not aggressively enforced until 
two years ago, after Congress provided more money to the Department 
of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department to investigate 
complaints. In the last two years, the government has obtained settlements 
in 67 dumping cases and has collected $2.3 million in penalties _ 
more than in the previous 10 years combined. In one case, a West Virginia 
doctor was fined $100,000 for rejecting two patients who had been 
severely injured in an auto accident. The government says the patients 
were transferred in unstable condition to another hospital, traveling 
80 miles in an ambulance on winding mountain roads in poor weather. 
One patient died. In announcing the new policy statement, June Gibbs 
Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, 
said that hospitals must provide emergency care to all patients who 
need it and may not delay services while they seek approval from a 
health maintenance organization or other insurer. No HMO contract 
``can excuse a hospital from providing needed emergency medical screening 
and stabilizing care,'' even if the contract requires the patient 
or the hospital to get prior authorization, Ms. Brown said. The policy 
statement, reported by USA Today, will be issued by the government 
as a special advisory bulletin. The public will have 30 days to comment 
on it before it becomes final. Doctors and hospitals had asked the 
government to clarify its interpretation of the 1986 law, the Emergency 
Medical Treatment and Labor Act. Under the law, if a person seeks 
care at an emergency room, the hospital must provide ``an appropriate 
medical screening examination'' and ``such treatment as may be required 
to stabilize the medical condition'' of patient. The inspector general 
receives 200 complaints a year from patients who say they have been 
denied emergency care. Ms. Brown said her investigations of complaints 
showed that ``managed care patients are more likely to be victims 
of dumping than other patients.'' HMOs challenge this contention, 
and the government is not issuing detailed data to show the number 
of complaints from patients with different types of insurance coverage. 
Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health 
Plans, a trade group for HMOs, said she had no reason to believe that 
HMO patients were more likely to be denied treatment. ``We have seen 
no data to support that statement,'' Ms. Ignagni said. ``If the inspector 
general has such statistics, we would certainly like to see them and 
will work with the administration to address any problems that may 
exist.'' Moreover, Ms. Ignagni said: ``If people feel they need to 
go to an emergency room, they should go. They will be covered. They 
won't be denied coverage if they believe that they have an emergency. 
That's part of our code of conduct, endorsed by 1,000 health plans.'' 
In recent years, many patients, doctors and hospitals have become 
embroiled in disputes with HMOs over payment for emergency room services. 
Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research 
Group, a consumer organization, said: ``There has been a dangerous 
lack of enforcement of the anti-dumping law. One of every 10 hospitals 
in the United States has been caught violating the law at least once. 
We believe the number of violators is much larger. Until two years 
ago, few of the hospitals that violated the law were fined.'' In its 
policy statement, the government suggests ``best practices'' that 
hospitals should follow to avoid violating the law. These recommendations 
are not legally binding. But if followed, they would profoundly alter 
current practice. For they say that a hospital should not even ask 
a patient or an HMO about insurance coverage or financial liability 
until the patient's condition has been evaluated and stabilized. Under 
the 1986 law, a hospital stabilizes a patient's condition by providing 
whatever treatment is needed to assure that there will be ``no material 
deterioration'' of the patient's condition when the person is discharged 
or transferred from the hospital. The American College of Emergency 
Physicians, which represents nearly 20,000 doctors, applauded the 
efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services. ``These guidelines 
will be helpful to patients, doctors and nurses,'' said Dr. Charlotte 
S. Yeh, chairwoman of the college's government affairs committee. 
``Many HMOs want hospitals or emergency room employees to contact 
them before we provide screening and stabilization services _ before 
we even determine the full scope of a patient's problems. They give 
us a hard time if we don't ask for prior authorization, and HMOs sometimes 
deny payment after the fact, saying the situation was not a true emergency. 
``As emergency department personnel, we feel obligated to examine 
and stabilize patients regardless of their ability to pay. That's 
what the law says. Morally and ethically, we believe that's the right 
thing to do,'' she said. In May, President Clinton reprimanded Ravenswood 
Hospital in Chicago, saying it had allowed a 15-year-old boy to die 
of gunshot wounds outside its doors. ``No one should be left untreated 
just footsteps from a hospital entrance,'' Clinton said then, and 
he vowed to prevent any recurrence of ``this inexplicable tragedy.''
