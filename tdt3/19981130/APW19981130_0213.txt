Motorists filled their tanks and apartment managers rushed for heating 
oil Monday fearing shortages in expectation of a strike by customs 
officers which could lead off a week of crippling strikes. Railway 
workers and doctors at state-run hospitals also began strikes Monday. 
Others expected later in the week include trolley and bus drivers, 
tax officials and school teachers. The strikes are part of growing 
labor union opposition to government fiscal reforms aimed at gaining 
Greece a spot in the European Union's single currency club by 2001. 
Teachers and others also are resisting changes seeking to bring Greek 
education and business practices more in line with the rest of the 
EU. Customs union officials called the five-day strike to protest 
government plans to unify pension funds from various agencies. Greeks 
worry about shortages of gasoline and heating oil as tankers and trucks 
are left stranded. The Socialist government is seeking a court injunction 
ordering the workers back to their posts. Greece is the only country 
of the 15-member EU that failed to qualify for the first round of 
the single currency. Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.
