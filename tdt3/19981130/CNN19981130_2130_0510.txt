This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News" weather 
forecast for Tuesday. A storm is moving into the west with more rain, 
more mountain snow and very windy conditions. As we go through the 
day on Tuesday, a second system will drop into the northwest, so the 
wet weather in that region will continue. Could be a couple feet of 
snow in some of the higher elevations of the mountains out west. Meanwhile, 
a cold front pushes rapidly across the east with showers and even 
possibly some thunderstorms in the south, but could be an icy mix 
over some northern sections of New England. Tuesday's highs, a little 
cooler around the Great Lakes, the mid-atlantic, 40s and 50s. But 
it'll still be plenty warm in the south. We look for 60s and 70s. 
Looking ahead to Wednesday, rain and wind continue in the northwest, 
with some showers through the southwest. On Thursday, those showers 
are moving across the plains toward the mississippi river. And temperatures 
are still mild in the plains and in the southeastern U.S. friday, 
look for scattered showers around the Great Lakes. Still a bit on 
the mild side with the coolest air in the northwest with showers and 
snow, as well. Don't forget, four-day forecasts, 7,200 cities, CNN.com.
