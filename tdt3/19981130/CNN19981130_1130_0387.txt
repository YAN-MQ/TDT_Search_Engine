Attorney general Janet Reno must decide today whether to recommend 
another independent counsel investigation of the Clinton administration. 
It would focus on former deputy White House chief of staff Harold 
Ickes. The independent counsel would investigate charges that Ickes 
lied to a Senate committee about whether the Clinton administration 
tried to intervene in a teamsters union dispute in exchange for campaign 
donations. By next week, Reno also must make a decision on a possible 
independent counsel investigation of President Clinton. This one concerns 
democratic national committee campaign commercials.
