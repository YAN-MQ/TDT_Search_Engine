Effective today, gun purchases shouldn't take as long, but they may 
be more complicated. A new national system provides instant background 
checks on all gun purchases, including rifles and shotguns. That means 
the usual number of computer records checks by the FBI and state authorities 
will double to an estimated 12.4 million per year. On average, that 
many firearms are sold each year in the United States. Officials say 
they may have problems implementing the system because december is 
the busiest month of the year for gun sales.
