Commodity prices, led by a plunge in oil and natural gas, dropped 
sharply Monday, pushing one key index to a 26-year low. The persistent 
weakness of commodity prices continues to hobble many emerging-market 
countries _ from Russia and Indonesia to Mexico and Chile _ that depend 
on such exports for economic growth and government financing. Many 
analysts say they doubt there will be a turnaround in commodity prices 
until sometime in mid-1999, which means prices are likely to fall 
further. The turnaround, analysts say, is contingent on a revival 
of the Asian economies that were hit hard by the financial crisis 
that began in Thailand in July 1997. The plunge Monday came as commodity 
prices had been experiencing a slight rebound from the low set at 
the end of August when the stock market was falling sharply. Since 
then there had been a rally in some agricultural commodity prices, 
including wheat, corn, sugar and coffee. But prices for industrial 
materials remained weak. ``We had a rally that was not steeped in 
industrial commodities,'' said William O'Neill, director of futures 
research at Merrill Lynch. The Journal of Commerce index of 17 industrial 
commodities is down 5.5 percent since the end of August. But now some 
of the agricultural price gains are slipping, and the price of oil 
is plunging. By contrast, at the August low in commodity indexes, 
oil prices were rising. On Monday, the price of oil for January delivery 
dropped 65 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $11.22 a barrel, its lowest in 
12 years. During the day the price fell as low as $10.82 a barrel 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The plunge came after last week's 
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties failed 
to extend the group's earlier agreement to cut production. ``The meeting 
had the worst possible result,'' O'Neill said. ``They didn't even 
roll over the agreement, and they left people concerned about OPEC 
in general.'' Natural gas prices, which have suffered because of warm 
late-autumn weather in the Northeast, dropped 22 cents, or 10 percent, 
to $1.976 for 1,000 cubic feet. The price has dropped 23 percent in 
just over two weeks. Prices also fell for home heating oil. Prices 
for cocoa, silver, gold, live cattle, orange juice, coffee and cotton 
also slipped. Copper dropped to an 11{-year low. The Goldman Sachs 
index of 22 commodities fell 3.97 points, to 133.55, its lowest in 
26 years. The Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities, 
which is more heavily weighted to agricultural products, dropped 1.57 
points, to 195.42, just above its 21-year low close on Aug. 28. As 
in August, the weakness in commodity prices is a reflection of the 
decline in demand for oil, copper and other commodities since Asian 
countries fell into recession after the devaluation of currencies 
in 1997. But O'Neill said an additional factor was the prospect of 
slower growth in the United States and in Europe next year. ``I see 
evidence, in talking to domestic copper refiners, that their order 
books are good but are starting to slow down,'' he said. And while 
demand is the core problem, oversupply of many commodities also plays 
a role. The breakdown of the OPEC agreement to curb production probably 
means that supplies will be more than plentiful. And in copper, Chile, 
which is a major producer, has not curtailed its effort to raise production 
despite the fall in price, which is down 42 percent since June 1997.
