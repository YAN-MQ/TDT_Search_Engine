Will Deutsche Bank's $10.1 billion acquisition of Bankers Trust be 
the big banking merger that actually melds vastly different cultures, 
titanic egos and far-flung businesses? Luckily for Bankers Trust shareholders, 
they need not wait around to find out. Because the deal is for cash 
rather than shares of Deutsche Bank, Bankers Trust shareholders can 
take the money and run. And it is a tidy sum. According to the terms 
of the deal announced Monday, shareholders in Bankers Trust will receive 
$93 a share in cash for a stock that was trading at about $62 a share 
two weeks ago. When the market swooned in early October, the shares 
had fallen to $49.1875 from the April high of $136.4375. Deutsche 
Bank's price for Bankers Trust is equivalent to 2.3 times the book 
value of Bankers Trust and 15.8 times consensus earnings estimates 
for 1999 of $5.90 a share. The premium to book value is in line with 
the average price to book value _ 2.4 times _ that investors are now 
paying for shares of five big U.S. investment firms. In early summer, 
however, when all was still well with most of the world, such a deal 
would have been considered a bargain. As of June 15, the average price 
to acquire an investment bank, according to the Friedman, Billings, 
Ramsey brokerage firm, was 3.5 times book value. But all is not right 
with the world, and the price Deutsche Bank is willing to pay for 
Bankers Trust is nobody's idea of cheap. When compared with Bankers 
Trust's third-quarter loss of $4.98 a share, it gets expensive indeed. 
``Given the volatility of the markets, it's a full price,'' said Carla 
D'Arista, managing director at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. ``But given 
the potential upside, it's an attractive price.'' What is the potential 
for what will be the world's largest financial company? Even as they 
announced their big purchase, Deutsche Bank executives were uncharacteristically 
cautious Monday. Often when announcing mergers, managements contend 
that the deal will produce an almost immediate benefit to the combined 
companies' net income. Not in this deal. Analysts were told that the 
acquisition would not increase earnings at the merged companies until 
2001. Then, if the forecasts are correct, the deal will push earnings 
up by just 10 percent to 15 percent. The executives did state that 
cutting costs _ reducing the work force by 5.7 percent, for starters 
_ would produce savings of $1 billion. The deal is expected to close 
in April followed by the issuance of American depository receipt shares 
next summer. Many analysts assume that Deutsche Bank is buying Bankers 
Trust to penetrate the lucrative U.S. market for managing assets and 
advising on mergers and acquisitions. But one analyst said the deal's 
silver lining might be that it allowed the German bank to position 
itself for the wave of corporate consolidation across Europe that 
is expected after the euro, the single currency, is established, starting 
Jan. 1. ``Most of the U.S.'s major banks have been talking about reallocating 
resources to Continental Europe,'' said Charles Peabody, a bank analyst 
at Mitchell Securities in New York. ``They're expecting merger mania 
and leveraged buyouts to balloon as Western Europe consolidates. Deutsche 
Bank is buying Bankers Trust's expertise in leveraged lending and 
M &AMP; A advisory so they can import it into the frenzy.'' Another 
benefit to the combination may come in the area of money management. 
Tom Burnett, managing director at Merger Insight in New York, said: 
``As more German companies go public, a lot of those corporate executives 
are going to be moving to new wealth levels. They'll be candidates 
for investment management.'' Even those companies that remain private 
will be open to Bankers Trust-style asset management, Burnett said. 
Still, the timing and size of the deal left some analysts breathless. 
Diane Glossman, a bank analyst at Lehman Brothers, said: ``Bankers 
Trust shareholders are lucky to have seen this kind of price so quickly 
after the losses of the third quarter. Over time it's possible that 
management would have worked to resurrect profitability and price 
improvement, but you wouldn't have seen it this fast.'' The transaction 
is also a big bet by Deutsche Bank that there will not be a global 
recession next year. Never mind that economic growth in Europe is 
slowing. Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics 
in Valhalla, said, ``I really am surprised from an economic perspective 
that the eagerness to take risk is there at this point in the cycle.''
