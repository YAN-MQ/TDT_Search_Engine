That just about ends this hour of VOA News Now. Please stay tuned 
as we can continue. And news roundup is coming up at the top of the 
hour. It's 21 hours 30 universal time, and this is VOA News Now. President 
Clinton is urging increased financial aid for the Palestinians to 
support the peace process with Israel. Israel's defense minister has 
ruled out an Israeli troop withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, and Dateline 
looks at how women around the world are gaining more power as agents 
for change in our next half hour of VOA News Now. First, a summary 
of world news. I'm Robert Burns, VOA News.
