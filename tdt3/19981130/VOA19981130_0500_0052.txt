Israeli officials say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's inner cabinet 
will continue on Wednesday a debate over how to respond to the upsurge 
of guerrilla attacks against Israeli troop in southern Lebanon. VOA's 
David Gulles reports from Jerusalem. An initial meeting of the inner 
cabinet ended inconclusively Sunday evening. But Israel radio says 
there is a consensus among top Netanyahu advisors against a unilateral 
withdrawal from Lebanon in the face of attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas 
that have killed seven Israeli soldiers in the last two weeks. Despite 
public pressure for a pullout, military chiefs fear that if Israel 
abandons its self-declared security zone in Lebanon, Hezbollah would 
pull up to the border and shell northern Israeli towns. They are also 
reluctant to hand a victory to Syria, which they say has encouraged 
the Hezbollah offensive as a way of pressuring Israel to resume talks 
on returning the Golan Heights. Late Sunday, Israeli troops shelled 
suspected Hezbollah targets north of the security zone and Israeli 
rockets at a hilltop position southeast of the Lebanese port city 
of Tyre. David Gulles, VOA News, Jerusalem.
