the House Judiciary Committee is expanding its impeachment probe. 
Today, committee Republicans - Or tomorrow, committee Republicans 
plan to issue five subpoenas for information about the fund-raising 
for President Clinton's 1996 reelection. NPR's Peter Overby reports. 
Sparking the subpoenas is information obtained by the committee that 
President Clinton was accused of criminal wrongdoing in an internal 
Justice Department memo. The memo was written last summer to Attorney 
General Janet Reno by Charles LaBella, who was leaving as head of 
the department's campaign financing task force. Reno has refused to 
let other congressional committees see the document. She says it contains 
too much grand jury information, but a Justice Department official 
told NPR Monday night that the department has been trying hard to 
get the memo to the Judiciary Committee. Two of the subpoenas are 
for depositions from LaBella and FBI Director Louis Freeh, who wrote 
Reno a similar memo. The committee wants documents from Reno and it 
wants the president to tell Reno to comply promptly. But a committee 
spokesman says there will not be an extended campaign finance probe.
