Just over one week ago, the world lost another peace activist and 
potential leader with the assassination of Russian lawmaker Galena 
Staravoitova. Lynn Hinckel of the Chicago-based group, Women of the 
World, says she's not surprised by the outpouring of grief in Russia. 
She compares the slaying to that of U.S. civil rights leader Martin 
Luther King in 1968. She has been such a voice for people who were 
disenfranchised and who really didn't have a voice in the system. 
And she represented ethnic minorities. She was fearless in the face 
of extremism most recently when Jews were being attacked in the parliament. 
Lynn Hinckel says Ms. Staravoitova was a board member of Women of 
the World, and she says she hopes other Russian women will step into 
her shoes.
