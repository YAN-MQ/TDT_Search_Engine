The Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos have taken another big stride 
in their march towards perfection. Quarterback John Elway tossed the 
season high four touchdown passes in the Broncos 31-16 triumph Sunday 
night over the San Diego Chargers. The Broncos are the fourth team 
in National Football League history to open the season with 12 straight 
wins. The Broncos began the game as AFC West Champions, after Oakland 
lost earlier to Washington, 29-19. Atlanta joined the Broncos in the 
playoff field.
