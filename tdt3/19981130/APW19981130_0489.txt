Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif left Monday for a two-day visit to the 
United States promising to highlight the disputed Kashmir region -- 
the flash point of two wars on the newly nuclear Asian subcontinent. 
``I will underscore the need for greater world attention in resolving 
the (Kashmir) dispute, the root cause of tension and instability in 
South Asia,'' Sharif said in his departure statement. Pakistan and 
India fought two wars in 1948 and again in 1965 over the remote Himalayan 
region of Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947. They fought 
a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh or what was then East Pakistan. 
Kashmir, the only Muslim majority state in Hindu-dominated India, 
is divided between Pakistan and India and each country lays claim 
to a united Kashmir. Sharif said Pakistan's security concerns and 
nonproliferation issues will be high on his agenda during talks with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. The United States is expected to press 
Pakistan to sign the global nuclear test ban treaty, but Islamabad 
says it wants lifting of economic sanctions first. The sanctions were 
imposed on Pakistan and India last May following their tit-for-tat 
nuclear tests. Earlier this month Washington eased some sanctions. 
``Talks with the United States on nuclear issues always tend to test 
Pakistan's diplomacy to its limits,'' Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's former 
ambassador to the United States, said in an editorial Monday in the 
leading English-language daily newspaper, The News. ``Clinton's invitation 
to Sharif to visit the U.S. reflects Washington's assumption that 
more progress is possible with Pakistan on the nonproliferation,'' 
she said. ``No such invitation to Indian prime minister is indicative 
of Delhi's greater reticence on the Washington sponsored road-map 
of nuclear restraint.'' Sharif said he wants to restore close economic 
and defense ties between the two countries. Sharif will stop briefly 
in Norway en route to the United States where he will inaugurate a 
Pakistan Television network aimed at the Pakistani community living 
in Europe.
