The year 2000 census is the focus of a legal dispute before the Supreme 
Court today. The census bureau estimates four million people were 
not counted in 1990. The Clinton administration wants to use statistical 
sampling to fill in the gaps. The house opposes that, saying the constitution 
requires an exact count, not an estimate. The Supreme Court's decision 
is expected to affect billions of dollars in federal aid, as well 
as the shape of election districts nationwide.
