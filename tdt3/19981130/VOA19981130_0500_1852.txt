Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's inner cabinet debated how to respond 
to the recent Hezbollah attacks, but apparently reached no conclusion. 
VOA's David Gulles in Jerusalem reports that the debate will continue 
on Wednesday. An initial meeting of the 12-member inner cabinet ended 
inconclusively, Sunday evening. But Israeli radio says there is a 
consensus among top Netanyahu advisors against any unilateral withdrawal 
in the face of attacks that have killed seven Israeli soldiers in 
the last two weeks. Grieving relatives of those killed protested outside 
the residents of Israeli President Azer Vizman, Sunday night. And 
newspaper polls suggest nearly half the Israeli public would favor 
abandoning the security zone Israel set up in south Lebanon in 1985. 
However, Prime Minister Netanyahu told reporters, no one in the 12-member 
inner cabinet of security officials suggested that Israel get up and 
leave. Mr. Netanyahu also said his heart is with every family that 
has suffered because of the casualties, but that the cabinet has the 
responsibility to do what is right for Israel and not react to newspaper 
headlines. Military chiefs fear that if Israel abandons the roughly 
15 kilometer wide security zone in Lebanon, Hezbollah would pull up 
to the border and shell northern Israeli towns. They are also reluctant 
to hand a victory to Syria, which they say has encouraged the Hezbollah 
offensive as a way of pressuring Israel to resume talks on returning 
the Golan Heights. Late Sunday, Israeli troops responded to a Hezbollah 
mortar attack on pro-Israeli militiamen in the security zone, by heavily 
shelling suspected guerrilla targets beyond the buffer strip. Israeli 
aircraft also fired rockets at a hilltop position southeast of the 
Lebanese port city of Tyre. Israeli planes have been in action almost 
every day since Hezbollah began the wave of roadside ambushes of Israeli 
patrols. David Gulles, VOA News, Jerusalem. And the Israeli cabinet 
has scheduled a tour of northern Israel to better understand the security 
situation. Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in south Lebanon 
over the past two weeks, prompting demonstrations by some Israelis 
against keeping soldiers there. Washington is urging restraint on 
both sides.
