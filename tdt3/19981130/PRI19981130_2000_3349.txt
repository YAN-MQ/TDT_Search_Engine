At first listen, the sextet Real Time might sound like yet another 
group playing the kind of Irish music popularized by River Dance. 
No surprise there. Three of Real Time's members also perform in European 
and American productions of the hit show. But Real Time doesn't confine 
itself to traditional Irish jigs and reels. Sometimes Real Time sounds 
more country than Celtic. Remember Nashville Cats? Well, that's "Nashville 
Brats" by the Irish group, Real Time. It's from their latest CD, "Live 
it Up."
