Dominique Moceanu, the 17-year-old Olympic gymnast, received a temporary 
protective order Monday against her father, whom she accused of stalking 
and harassing her since she won emancipation from her parents a month 
ago. She said in an interview Monday night that her father had hired 
a private investigator to trail her, had waited outside her high school 
as she arrived and left, and had tried to follow her. Dominique Moceanu 
also said she believed her father had tapped her phone. Her allegations 
come barely a month after she was granted adult status by a Houston 
judge. That Oct. 28 ruling apparently resolved a lawsuit in which 
she accused her parents of squandering the earnings from her gymnastics 
career, which reached its zenith with a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics 
in Atlanta. In the interview Monday night and in court papers, Moceanu 
said Houston police detectives told her on Nov. 13 that they were 
investigating allegations that her father, Dimitru Moceanu, was trying 
to hire someone to kill one of her friends and her gymnastics coach. 
The Houston police said Monday that its homicide division had investigated 
threats allegedly made in the case, but that the matter was inconclusive, 
no charges were filed and no arrests were made. ``The case is now 
closed,'' said Robert Hurst, a Houston police spokesman. Katherine 
Scardino, the Houston lawyer representing Dimitru Moceanu, said Monday 
night that she had spoken with Sgt. Hal Kennedy of the Houston police 
about a tape-recorded conversation during which threats were allegedly 
made by Moceanu against a 32-year-old friend of the gymnast, but that 
police felt there was insufficient evidence to make a case. Scardino 
said she told Dimitru Moceanu that his daughter was an adult and that 
it was time to ``back off and leave her alone.'' Ellen Yarrell, Dominique 
Moceanu's lawyer, said from Houston, ``This is a story about a father 
stalking and threatening his daughter.'' Dominique Moceanu left her 
family's home in October and moved to an apartment in the Houston 
area. However, she has not lived in the apartment for the past two 
and a half weeks, she said, because she fears for her safety. She 
has stopped attending Northland Christian School in Houston and may 
hire security personnel to protect her, she said. ``I'm scared,'' 
Dominique Moceanu said Monday night. ``You just don't know what's 
possible. This has been tough on my mental and physical health. I'm 
really stressed out. He's trying to control me and my life. He's been 
following me and knows my every move.'' On Nov. 13, Moceanu said, 
three homicide detectives came to her apartment and said that her 
father was under investigation for allegedly trying to have the friend 
and her gymnastics coach, Luminita Miscenco, killed. ``If this has 
no merit, why did three officers do this?'' Yarrell said. ``These 
are not trumped-up issues that this lady heard a rumor. She had a 
visit.'' Dimitru Moceanu may want to ``get his hands around'' the 
neck of his daughter's friend, Scardino said, but he does not want 
him killed. ``She's still 17 years old and running around with people 
who obviously messed her up so bad,'' Scardino said. ``It's difficult 
for a parent to back off and let her make all these mistakes.'' Scardino 
said that ``it goes beyond the realm of realism'' to think that Dimitru 
Moceanu would harm his daughter. She also said that she was growing 
tired of Dominique Moceanu's ``whining'' about an abusive childhood 
and blamed the gymnast for not appreciating the sacrifices her parents 
had made for her career. In an affidavit filed Monday in the 309th 
Judicial District in Harris County, Texas, however, Dominique Moceanu 
said that she was ``terrified that my father will soon be successful 
in harming me or one of my friends or associates.'' Her affidavit 
added, ``I believe that all of my father's actions are intended to 
result in physical harm, bodily injury or assault to me or my friends.'' 
She was granted a temporary protective order preventing her father 
from communicating with her or going near her residence or school. 
Another hearing is set for Dec. 9. ``They've had a great life living 
on my earnings and got greedy over the years,'' Dominique Moceanu 
said in an interview. ``It tore the family apart. It's sad that money 
does this to people. I was hoping to get back together with them. 
I guess it's not possible.''
