United States Secretary of Commerce William Daley on Monday began 
his third trip to Africa this year, telling reporters in Cape Town 
that intellectual property rights was a major issue for trade with 
South Africa. Daley and a 16-member trade delegation will also travel 
to Nigeria, Kenya and the Ivory Coast, completing a trip originally 
planned for September. That trip was postponed because of destruction 
by the August bombing of the U.S. embassy that destroyed much of Nairobi, 
Kenya. Daley congratulated the South African government on its ``unwavering 
commitment to its macroeconomic strategy''. After apartheid ended 
with the first all-race elections in 1994, the African National Congress 
surprised economic analysts by adopting free-market economic policies 
instead of a more controlled, socialist approach to the market. ``This 
visit is about the forging of productive partnerships between U.S. 
and South African companies,'' Daley said in a prepared statement. 
Tax and tariff issues will also be on the agenda for talks between 
Daley and his South African counterpart Alec Erwin. The U.S. delegation 
includes senior executives from large companies, including Coca Cola, 
Chevron, DuPont, Enron, Eastman Kodak and Pfizer, a pharmaceutical 
company. On a trip to South Africa earlier this year, Daley met with 
South Africa's health minister to discuss controversial laws aimed 
at reducing the price of prescription drugs in South Africa. U.S. 
pharmaceutical officials have charged that the law violates intellectual 
property rights by requiring doctors to write prescriptions only for 
generic drugs _ medicines where patent rights have expired. Daley 
and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on Tuesday are to address a high 
profile investment conference that will include European Commissioner 
Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Botswana President Festus Mogae and Namibian 
Prime Minister Hage Geingob. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was 
expected to attend but cancelled. U.S. President Bill Clinton continues 
to champion Africa trade legislation that would require the president 
to start free-trade negotiations with African countries and increase 
funding to back U.S. investments in the continent's 48 countries. 
The bill passed the House of Representatives but died in the Senate 
before Congress recessed in October. The bill will be considered anew 
next year. Despite its population of 800 million, Africa accounts 
for only 1 percent of U.S. trade worldwide. U.S.-South African trade 
now stands at over dlrs 5.5 billion and the U.S. invested over dlrs 
2 billion in South Africa in 1997, Daley said.
