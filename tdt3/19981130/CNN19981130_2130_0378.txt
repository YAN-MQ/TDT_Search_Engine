Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip are getting a big boost 
to help develop their economy. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright 
says a donors' conference in washington today raised more than $3 
billion for the cause. More than 40 countries contributed. President 
Clinton says the United States alone will increase aid to the palestinians 
by $400 million. He met with Palestinian authority President Yasser 
Arafat at the White House today. Mr. Clinton says lasting peace will 
take hold only if it improves the lives of the people. By building 
prosperity in Gaza and in the West Bank, by promoting regional economic 
cooperation, by giving young Palestinians a chance to channel their 
dreams into positive opportunities, you lay the groundwork for a Peace 
that will last not for a year or a lifetime, but for generations to 
come. At the conference, Arafat accused Israel of undermining the 
Palestinian authority. He says the Israeli policy of closing the borders 
of the Gaza strip and the West Bank as a security measure has kept 
thousands of Palestinian from holding jobs in the Jewish state.
