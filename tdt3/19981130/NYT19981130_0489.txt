The explosion in the world's poorest countries of AIDS, or of infection 
with the virus that causes it, is turning back half a century of progress 
in making life healthier for children, the director of the U.N. children's 
fund says. ``The implications are quite extraordinary,'' said Carol 
Bellamy, executive director of the agency, UNICEF. ``In 23 countries, 
largely in sub-Saharan Africa, we already see HIV-AIDS virtually reversing 
the gains that have been made in child survival. ``More children are 
dying and they're dying sooner, even though your immunization programs 
might be more successful,'' she said. ``The fact is that improvements 
that were being made are being reversed. Not just stalled. Reversed.'' 
What U.N. experts now call an AIDS pandemic, coupled with the increasing 
vulnerability of millions of families to the disruption and violence 
of civil wars, is forcing agencies dealing with children to rethink 
priorities and to introduce new programs, officials say. ``This pandemic 
is hitting most harshly, at this point, in southern Africa and eastern 
Africa,'' Ms. Bellamy said last week before leaving for a news conference 
in London, in advance of U.N. AIDS Day on Tuesday. In London, new 
AIDS figures were made public by the World Health Organization and 
the joint program called U.N.AIDS, in which UNICEF takes part. ``Botswana, 
for example, is losing 20 years in life expectancy in just abut a 
five-year period of time,'' Ms. Bellamy said. ``It's not a country 
in conflict, or a country at war. It's stable.'' At the news conference, 
AIDS experts announced that the number of cases worldwide of people 
living with the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, had 
grown by 10 percent in a year, to 33.4 million. For UNICEF, the AIDS 
crisis poses a range of problems. The number of orphans is soaring, 
Ms. Bellamy said. ``It is expected to grow _ and these are guestimates 
_ to 40 million by the year 2020.'' In eight sub-Saharan countries, 
more than 25 percent of children under 15 have already lost at least 
one parent, she said. These children are more likely than others to 
drop out of school and are less likely to be brought to clinics for 
vaccinations. ``Even in the least developed countries, much of the 
work of development organizations is premised on there being a primary 
care giver,'' Ms. Bellamy said. ``The immunization system assumes 
that a mother _ as sick as she may be and no matter how many other 
kids she has _ will take the child to be immunized.'' Because AIDS 
strikes hardest at the 10-to-24 age group, UNICEF, which is identified 
mostly with programs for early childhood, will have to concentrate 
more on adolescent sex education, she said, something that is not 
always a popular cause among donors. ``In contrast to five years ago, 
we find ourselves in parts of the world more involved with adolescents 
than we have been in the past,'' Ms. Bellamy said. The fear of transmission 
of the AIDS virus from mother to child is also forcing UNICEF to modify, 
to some extent, its strong preference for breast-feeding. ``We are 
not reopening the discussion about breast-feeding being the best thing 
you can do for your child _ except, yes, you specifically open it 
around the subject of mother-to-child transmission,'' Ms. Bellamy 
said. ``In fact, we are very actively engaged with U.N.AIDS and with 
others in programs for women, negotiating with the baby food companies 
for contributions of generic materials.'' Ms. Bellamy said that because 
half of the 7,000 new cases daily are among young people, the best 
hope of stopping the rapid spread of the disease lies in creating 
intensive education programs and in encouraging peer-group projects. 
``This is one ray of hope,'' she said. ``The future does lie in adolescents' 
hands and if there could be more effort, really very concentrated 
advocacy, information and services programs focused on adolescents, 
there is some potential for getting control of this pandemic.''
