JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ AIDS has rapidly crept up on South 
Africa and poses a tragedy worse than apartheid, the top U.N. AIDS 
official said Monday. ``We are faced with an unprecedented crisis,'' 
Dr. Peter Piot, head of the U.N. AIDS program told reporters. The 
scourge is greater than the system of white minority rule or natural 
tragedies like drought: ``None of them will claim so many victims,'' 
he said. Piot traveled from his Geneva headquarters to emphasize the 
latest global AIDS figures, which were released last week and show 
the crisis still burns hottest in Africa, particularly the southern 
part. About two-thirds of the 33 million people infected with the 
AIDS virus, HIV, live south of the Sahara. Two million people will 
die of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa this year, four times the 
total for the rest of the world. Piot said it was ``striking and shocking'' 
how young girls on the continent were particularly affected -- because 
of their vulnerability. In South Africa, 9.5 percent of pregnant under-15s 
were HIV positive. Adult HIV infection rates in Botswana, Namibia, 
Swaziland and Zimbabwe -- South African neighbors -- hover between 
20 percent and 25 percent, the United Nations said. Apartheid, which 
ended in 1994, helped isolate South Africa and made it a latecomer 
to the AIDS epidemic. But it is fast catching up with its neighbors, 
with 3.2 million South Africans HIV positive, or about 12 to 14 percent 
of adults. South Africa accounts for more than half of the region's 
new infections this year, with 1,500 infections occurring every day, 
UNAIDS said Monday. More than 1 million South Africans will have died 
of AIDS by 2001, bringing the life expectancy from 68 years to 48 
within the first decade of the new millennium, the U.N. Development 
Program said. According to other reports released Monday by South 
African health authorities and UNDP, the causes for the fast spread 
here are: poverty, greater mobility in a country with good transportation, 
the apartheid legacy of migrant workers, the low status of women which 
makes it difficult for them to protect themselves and resistance to 
condom use. With its relative wealth and sophisticated business community, 
South Africa could face pronounced damage to its economy as the disease 
kills off educated and skilled workers. David Whaley, the U.N. coordinator 
for South Africa, said the country had ``significantly less success 
than other developing countries'' in using its resources to fight 
poverty, which development officials blame for helping spread the 
disease. South Africa launched a ``partnership'' program in October 
with industries, unions and other groups to mobilize the country in 
education and prevention. Geraldine Fraser-Moloketi, the welfare minister, 
acknowledged the African National Congress government was ``a little 
bit late'' in responding.
