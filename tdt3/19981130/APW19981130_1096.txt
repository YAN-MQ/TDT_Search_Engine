Hundreds of Pakistanis and a handful of human rights demonstrators 
greeted Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the Norwegian capital 
Monday during a brief stopover on his way to meetings in Washington, 
D.C. Sharif was in Oslo on an informal visit to inaugurate transmissions 
of Pakistani television programs to Europe via a Norwegian satellite. 
The opening ceremony at the Oslo Concert House was broadcast to 42 
countries in Asia and 18 European countries. Pakistani residents of 
Norway packed the concert hall and repeatedly applauded the prime 
minister during his 45-minute speech in Urdu. Sharif mentioned Pakistan's 
first tests of nuclear devices this year and the international sanctions 
that followed. Pakistan and India, which have fought three wars in 
the past 50 years, both tested nuclear devices last May, leading to 
worldwide fears of a nuclear arms race in South Asia. The United States 
and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Pakistan, which has 
been on the verge of economic collapse. In Oslo, demonstrators were 
more concerned with a 1985 law in overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan that 
allows the death penalty for anyone convicted of blasphemy against 
Islam. In May, Pakistani Roman Catholic Bishop John Joseph, 65, killed 
himself to protest a blasphemy death sentence imposed on a fellow 
Pakistani Christian, which lead to widespread protests. Outside the 
Oslo Concert Hall, about two dozen demonstrators chanted ``No, No, 
Blasphemy Law'' when Sharif left the building. The protesters, from 
Amnesty International, also carried banners saying ``Blasphemy Trials: 
A way to judicial murder.'' Sharif was bound for Washington D.C. in 
hopes of convincing President Clinton to lift sanctions against Pakistan. 
His stop in Norway was the first by any Pakistani prime minister.
