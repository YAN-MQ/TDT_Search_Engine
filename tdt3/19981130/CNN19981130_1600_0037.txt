From Atlanta, this is "CNN Headline News." I'm Chuck Roberts. I am 
as I speak writing down the Dow's closing numbers. It's our lead story. 
Blue chips took a dive on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones industrial 
average saw its first triple-digit loss in two months. Again the preliminary 
figures show the Dow off 207.52. only Monday a week ago today, the 
Dow set a closing high of 9374. We'll have more at 16 past the hour, 
in our "Dollars & Sense" report.
