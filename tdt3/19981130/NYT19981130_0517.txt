The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 1: President 
Clinton's call yesterday for a new multibillion-dollar international 
aid package for the Palestinians is a necessary complement to the 
peace agreement he helped put together in Maryland earlier this fall. 
That diplomatic deal remains wobbly. It can be reinforced by showing 
that peace delivers tangible economic and social gains to ordinary 
Palestinians. But outside financial assistance will be effective only 
if the Palestinians can curtail corrupt practices in administering 
the aid. The additional $400 million in American aid that Clinton 
endorsed can also be a means of dissuading Yasser Arafat from following 
through on his threats to proclaim an independent Palestinian state 
when the original timetable of the Oslo peace agreement expires next 
May. About $2 billion in international aid has been provided to the 
Palestinians since 1993. Most has gone into specific projects, supervised 
and monitored by the donor nations. The $500 million already provided 
by Washington has been used to produce better water access for Palestinian 
towns, loans for local businesses and financing for Palestinian elections. 
Clinton now wants Congress to supply additional money for the industrial 
zones, airport and seaport agreed to in Maryland. Through careful 
supervision, Washington and other donor nations can minimize the improper 
diversion of this assistance. But corruption poses a potentially serious 
problem in other areas. For example, the Palestinian Authority needs 
outside funding for community social welfare projects to keep up with 
those now offered by organizations like Hamas. But such money, much 
of it flowing through the hands of Palestinian political appointees, 
is especially vulnerable to misuse by corrupt officials. An internal 
Palestinian audit last summer found instances of serious fraud and 
mismanagement within the Palestinian Authority. Arafat has not addressed 
the problem. That cannot be the end of the issue. Palestinian legislators 
and aid-giving nations must insist that he crack down on corruption. 
The Palestinian Authority will forfeit both domestic legitimacy and 
world respect unless it deals firmly with those who steal money meant 
to improve the lot of the Palestinian people.
