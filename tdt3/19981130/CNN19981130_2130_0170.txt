The Supreme Court has accepted a case that will determine how the 
2000 census will be conducted. Charles Bierbauer has that story. The 
census is taken by mail and on foot. The object is to count every 
school kid in Baltimore, Maryland -- as much as every suburbanite 
in Marietta, Georgia. Experience, though, shows that doesn't quite 
work. I've been there. I've done that. And I know you can't get them 
all by enumeration. So the Clinton administration is asking the Supreme 
Court to allow statistical sampling to categorize the 10% that's hard 
to find. Chief justice rehnquist was skeptical, quizzing solicitor 
general Seth waxman on the sampling technique. "How do you know what 
the true number is?" Waxman -- "demographers and statisticians have 
the means." Rehnquist -- "why do we need a census then?" Waxman -- 
"there's a constitutional requirement." The constitution calls for 
an actual enumeration for apportioning congressional seats. The republican 
majority in Congress argues that rules out sampling. Historically, 
though, a direct count has led to an undercount of urban and rural 
poor and minorities. Justice Stevens imagined an apartment building 
teeming with immigrants wary of being counted. Attorney Maureen Mahoney, 
arguing for the republicans, "your honor, they can't guess." Stevens 
-- "you'd put down 'zero' then?" Mahoney -- "that's right." There 
are high stakes involved beyond congressional seats. Federal funds 
are tied to population -- $640 a year for each school kid in baltimore, 
where officials say 11,000 were missed in the 1990 census. What was 
astonishing to me was that the republican arguers stated that they 
did not care about accuracy. What the administration wants to do is 
put off the decision till after the census is conducted. Then what 
do you do? We throw out a $4 billion census? a wary justice Scalia 
warned -- Congress has kept the census bureau on a limited budget, 
awaiting the Supreme Court's decision, expected by spring. That will 
give the census folks a scant year to prepare for whatever form census 
2000 takes. Charles Bierbauer, CNN, Washington.
