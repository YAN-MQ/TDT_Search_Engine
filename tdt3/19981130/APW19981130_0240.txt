Iraq leader Saddam Hussein's oldest son, Odai, has been awarded a 
doctorate in political science with distinction by Baghdad University, 
all of Iraq's state-run dailies reported Monday on their front pages. 
The awarding of the degree follows the printing and free distribution 
by the government of thousands of copies of Odai's dissertation, ``The 
Post-Cold War World,'' in which he predicted the moral and economic 
decline of the United States. The newspapers said that after receiving 
the degree Sunday, Odai presented it to his father. On the cover of 
the government version of the thesis, Saddam was depicted riding a 
white stallion and spearing a snake _ presumably representing the 
United States. In addition to his academic success, Odai, 34, runs 
the daily newspaper Babil and a state-run television station and is 
head of Iraq's Olympic committee. He also commands the Fedayeen Saddam, 
or ``Saddam's Martyrs,'' a paramilitary force of 40,000 who wear black 
masks on duty and are often shown on television butchering cats, dogs 
and wolves and then eating the raw meat to demonstrate their ferocity.
