Turning to the tennis ranking Spanish tennis player, Alex Corraces' 
season ending victory at the ATP championships helped shake up the 
men's world rankings released Monday. Pete Sampras of course maintains 
the number one spot as we've been telling you all weekend, but Marcella 
Rios also held number two, but it was Corraces jumping three spots 
to number three. Now that's his highest ranking ever. Australian Patrick 
Rafter dropped a notch to number four, while Spaniard Carlos Moyo 
held steady at number five.
