The weekly Monday night National Football League game features the 
San Francisco 49ers hosting the New York Giants. This is a battle 
of division winners from last season. Neither is currently on top. 
The Giants are really struggling with four wins against seven losses. 
San Francisco is 8 and 3 and needs a win to stay one game behind the 
Atlanta Falcons in their division. 49ers defensive tackle Brian Young 
says despite New York's record, the Giants still must be respected. 
We can't take those guys for granted, you know. We had a couple of 
teams that we played in season where they haven't had such a good 
record but they seem to play pretty well. So we've just got to go 
in and play this game as if they were on top of the league. San Francisco 
trails first place Atlanta which beat St. Louis on Sunday, 21 to 10. 
The Falcons are now 10 and 2 on the season and clinched a playoff 
berth.
