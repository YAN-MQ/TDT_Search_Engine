A Tokyo court on Monday rejected a compensation lawsuit by Dutch POWs 
from World War II, but the group called the ruling a partial victory 
and said it could win an appeal. ``The door is now slightly open,'' 
said Gerard Jungslager, a legal counselor. ``We have strong grounds 
for appeal.'' The class-action lawsuit was filed by eight people who 
were forced into slave labor by Japanese soldiers in countries now 
known as Indonesia, Singapore and Myanmar. The plaintiffs demanded 
a total of dlrs 176,000 from the Japanese government to compensate 
for physical abuses suffered in prison camps in the former Dutch East 
Indies, which Japan invaded in the 1940s. The only woman among the 
plaintiffs sued for being forced into sexual slavery by Japanese troops. 
The suit was filed in January 1994 on behalf of more than 35,000 Dutch 
people who claim they were victimized by Japanese forces in Asia during 
the war. On Monday, the Tokyo District Court acknowledged that Japanese 
soldiers had violated human rights protected by the 1907 Hague conventions, 
but ruled that the international law does not permit individuals to 
sue the government in wartime compensation cases. It was that admission 
of wrongdoing, and a difference of opinion over the kind of lawsuits 
that former Dutch POWs are permitted to file, that left Jungslager 
optimistic about their chances of winning the appeal before Japan's 
High Court. During the war, Japan forced many POWs to work in shipyards, 
mines and jungles in violation of international law. They were also 
beaten and some were executed. Thousands of women across Asia were 
forced into brothels for Japanese troops. Worse still, the POW death 
rate at the Japanese camps was 27 percent, compared to a 4 percent 
rate at Allied camps. After World War II, Allied nations used the 
1951 San Francisco peace treaty to forge bilateral treaties with Japan 
that resolved the issue of compensation for POWs from their countries. 
For instance, Japan paid the Netherlands about dlrs 1 million. Japanese 
courts often use those treaties to reject compensation claims by ex-prisoners, 
as the Tokyo District Court did last week in a case by seven plaintiffs 
on behalf of 20,000 ex-POWs from Britain, the United States, Australia 
and New Zealand. In Monday's ruling, Jungslager said, the court pointed 
out that the Hague conventions don't permit Dutch individuals to file 
such lawsuits, only their own governments on their behalf. But he 
said that when Japan and the Netherlands signed their Stikker Yoshida 
protocol in 1956, as part of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, his country 
agreed to maintain Dutch rights to file individual suits. ``We are 
convinced that Dutch individuals can bring forward a claim for compensation 
for the wrongdoings of the Japanese military in the former Dutch East 
Indies,'' said Jungslager.
