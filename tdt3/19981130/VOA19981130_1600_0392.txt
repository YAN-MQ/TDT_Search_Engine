Today, the secretary general is focusing on the dispute over Western 
Sahara. As we hear from our Middle East correspondent Scott Bob, Mr. 
Annan flew to Southwestern Algeria Monday to meet with Poldasario 
guerrillas. Mr. Annan met Monday in Chindu, Southwestern Algeria with 
leaders of the Poldasario front, which for 23 years has been fighting 
Morocco for control over the Western Sahara. He is to meet Tuesday 
and Wednesday with senior Algerian officials in Algiers before going 
to Tunisia later in the week. The trip is aimed at bringing about 
a referendum on the future of the Western Sahara. The Poldasario backed 
by Algeria wants independence for the former Spanish colony, while 
Morocco says it is a historical part of the Moroccan kingdom. The 
United Nations for nearly ten years has been trying to organize a 
referendum in the territory, but the poll has been postponed repeatedly 
because of disputes over voter lists. One-hundred-forty-thousand eligible 
voters have been identified and accepted, but Morocco and the Poldasario 
do not agree on whether another 60,000 people living in the region 
are eligible. Mr. Annan began his trip to North Africa in early November 
with visits to Mauritania and Morocco, but he broke it off after one 
week because of the crisis over Iraqi weapons inspections. U.N. officials 
say during this trip, the secretary general might also meet Libyan 
officials if Libya is prepared to accept proposals aimed at bringing 
to trial the two Libyan suspects in the plane bombing over Lockerbie, 
Scotland. He is then scheduled to go to Abu Dhabi for a meeting next 
week of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Scott Bob, VOA News, Middle 
East bureau.
