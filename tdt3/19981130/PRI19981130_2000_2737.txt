We're about to end the debate on today's geography quiz. We were looking 
for a European capital, a city where both French and Flemish are spoken, 
but most important for comic strip lovers everywhere, this city is 
the birthplace of the intrepid reporter Tin-Tin. Today's answer is 
Brussels, the capital of Belgium. It's actually in another French 
speaking capital, Paris, where Tin-Tin, a cross between Jimmy Olson 
and the Hardy Boys, continues to make news. A Paris auction house 
put Tin-Tin books and memorabilia on the block today, and they fetched 
over $300,000. Auction organizer Eric LaGua wasn't at all surprised 
of the affection bidders showed for Tin-Tin, or as they call him, 
Ta-Ta. It's very clever because you're working all around the world. 
You know he doesn't have money, no sex, no, nobody. So it's you, it's 
me, so you travel in the adventures. And you will have some clues, 
and everything. So it's magic. And it's also politics. In the controversy 
reminiscent of the debate over the morality of fictional TV reporter 
"Murphy Brown," the French parliament is now actually holding hearings 
to determine whether the fictional newspaper reporter, Tin-Tin, is 
liberal or conservative. Philippe Chatonay, foreign editor of "Love 
and Montajudi" magazine explains that Tin-Tin started out a bit to 
the right. The author of the Ta-Ta series called Erujay was suspected 
of having some sympathies in the direction of the Belgium Nazi movement 
before the war. And indeed, the first ever Ta-Ta comics book was called 
"Ta-Ta Vists the Land of the Soviets." And it certainly was not an 
advertisement for Communist Russia. But Chatonay says Tin-Tin or Ta-Ta 
had a political change of heart over the years. In one of the latest 
of his adventures, he turns out to be the best friend of a guerrilla 
movement in a Central America country. And I think that probably Mr. 
Erujay decided as he throughout his career to sort of lean a little 
bit more to the left perhaps to stay in tune with the modern French 
society. While Frankaphone comic book readers the world over will 
be waiting with baited breath to find out where Tin-Tin's political 
sympathies lie, there's been no word yet on whether his sidekick, 
the dog wonder, Meloo, will also come under scrutiny.
