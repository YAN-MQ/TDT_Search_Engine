A second top executive at Universal Studios has resigned less than 
a month after the head of the struggling film company quit. NPR's 
Andy Bauers reports. Universal Pictures head Casey Silver has offered 
his resignation following what has been a dismal year for the studio. 
Universal's last two films, "Babe, Pig in the City," and "Meet Joe 
Black" with Brad Pitt have both performed poorly at the box office. 
The sequel to the children's hit, "Babe," struggled over the holiday 
weekend after weeks of production delays and strong competition from 
Disney's "A Bug's Life" and Paramount's "The Rugrats Movie." Silver's 
resignation comes two weeks after Universal's parent company, Seagram, 
ousted the studio's CEO, Frank Biondi. Universal president Ron Meyer 
will absorb Silver's responsibilities, but it now seems clear that 
Seagram chief, Edgar Broffman, will take over more of the day-to-day 
running of the studio. Seagram, which once focused mostly on beverages, 
is now one of the leading players in the entertainment industry controlling 
a music company and several theme parks in addition to Universal Pictures.
