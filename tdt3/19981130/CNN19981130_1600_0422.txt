Texas prison officials say they're confident they'll recapture death 
row inmate Martin gurule. The convicted killer, along with six other 
inmates, escaped Thursday night from the state prison in Huntsville 
by cutting a fence with a hacksaw. The other six were caught by early 
Friday. Authorities are concentrating the search on an area near the 
prison. We still believe he's within seven mile area southeast of 
the prison. We have no reason to believe he has left this area. Overnight, 
we had several calls from residents thinking they had sighted him. 
We checked those out, those proved to be false leads and we are back 
to the original plan of searching this area about seven miles in circumference 
just southeast of the unit. Heavy rain they say is hampering the search. 
It's also very densely wooded.
