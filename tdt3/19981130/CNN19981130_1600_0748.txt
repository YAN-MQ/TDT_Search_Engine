Top stories are coming up in two minutes. Then, an update of Wall 
Street in "Dollars & Sense." Still ahead -- the voices behind the 
bugs in the nation's number one movie. Now for "diskette world" travel 
news -- notebook computers are traveling lighter with built-in superdisk 
drives. Only the superdisk drive works with both regular floppies 
and 120-megabyte superdisk diskettes. Floppies everywhere are thrilled

9999are on the way out. We can save a little. superdisk can save a 
lot. Together, we can save the world. Get it in Hewlett Packard notebooks.

between you and your next meal. Nothing. But today, there are materials 
that help lock out harmful contaminants and reduce spoilage. Keeping 
us safe and the food we eat fresh. Plastics make it possible. So now,
