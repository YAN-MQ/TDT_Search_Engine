Thousands of Iranians mourning the stabbing to death of a dissident 
and his wife took to the streets Monday calling for the release of 
political prisoners. Some 10,000 mourners who had gathered at the 
Fakhr Mosque in central Tehran to pray for Dariush Foruhar and his 
wife, whose murdered bodies were discovered in their home more than 
a week ago, poured into the streets chanting pro-democracy slogans. 
``Release all political prisoners,'' the protesters demanded. ``Freedom, 
security _ that is what we want,'' the crowd chanted in unison. Iranian 
officials say there are no political prisoners in Iran, but international 
human rights organizations accuse Iran of arbitrary arrest and detention 
and unfair trials. Police closed off the streets around the mosque 
and ordered the crowd to disperse. The protest ended without violence. 
President Mohammad Khatami has ordered an investigation into the murders, 
and police say they have several suspects. But no information has 
been made public. Over the past year, vigilantes who oppose Khatami's 
liberal reform program, have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers 
and even a reformist Cabinet minister. Foruhar, 70, was the leader 
of the Iran Nation Party, a small opposition group that is tolerated 
by the government. He served as minister of labor and social affairs 
in the provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately 
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the monarchy. His wife, 
Parvaneh, was in her mid-50s.
