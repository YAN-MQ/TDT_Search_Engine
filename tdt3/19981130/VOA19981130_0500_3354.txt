Hootie and the Blowfish have announced plans to visit US military 
bases for a week starting on December 3rd. Hootie and the Blowfish 
will be bringing some holiday cheer to US troops stationed overseas 
next month. It's the first time that the South Carolina quartet will 
take part in the annual USO Christmas Tour. The group's been busy 
shooting a video for their new single, "Only Lonely" and get ready 
to hear plenty of "Only Lonely". It's also featured on the soundtrack 
of the Kevin Costner, Paul Newman film, "Message in a Bottle" that 
is due out in theaters early next year. I'm Catherine Cole.
