Millions of people are exposed to dangerously high levels of Mercury 
from industrial waste each year. Now researchers may have found a 
way to clean up Mercury-polluted areas. Ann Kellan explains, in this 
edition of "tech trends." This little boy can barely walk a straight 
line. This woman suffers uncontrollable shaking. They are victims 
of Mercury poisoning. The famous thing that woke everyone was in the 
late '50s. The minimata bay poisoning of large numbers of people in 
Japan. Over 1,000 people died, and 10,000 people had permanent neurological 
damage. These pictures were taken almost 50 years ago, but the problem 
persists even today. Mercury-contaminated sites are so messed up. 
They're not going to go away on their own. Mercury pollution can be 
found almost everywhere, from the Amazon in Brazil to this site in 
Brunswick, Georgia. Dumped by industry, then ingested by fish, the 
toxic Mercury quickly moves up the food chain, poisoning other creatures, 
including humans. Researchers at the University of Georgia say they 
may have a way to get rid of poisonous Mercury by genetically altering 
plants to absorb toxic Mercury through their roots and release a less 
toxic form through their leaves. First, researchers shot a Mercury-eating 
Gene into plant cells. The cells were cultured and grew into plants. 
Some of the seeds from these plants not only survived in a Mercury-contaminated 
solution, they successfully absorbed Mercury from the soil. So are 
you excited? Yeah, we're very excited. It's taken years. And now, 
it works! It just doesn't work well, it works spectacularly well! 
Scientists say this technique can be used on any plant, including 
those that grow along Mercury-polluted rivers and marshes. The Georgia 
researchers believe these Mercury-eating plants have the potential 
to restore contaminated areas to natural habitat within a few years.
