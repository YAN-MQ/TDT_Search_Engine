Expanding into a lucrative corner of the cardiovascular device market, 
Medtronic Inc., the big pacemaker manufacturer, announced Monday that 
it would buy Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc., for $54 a share, 
or $3.7 billion, in Medtronic stock. The announcement was a windfall 
for Arterial Vascular shareholders, including dozens of company employees, 
pumping the share price to a 52-week high of $50 before it slipped 
to $48.875 in Nasdaq trading, up $16.50 for the day. Medtronic shares 
fell $2.375, to $67.625. It was the second big expansion in less than 
a month for Medtronic, which announced a $3.6 billion purchase, also 
financed with Medtronic stock, of the Sofamor Danek Group on Nov. 
2. Sofamor Danek makes rods and screws used in back surgery and imaging 
devices for brain surgery. Arterial Vascular makes tiny flexible tubes 
called stents that are inserted to prop open clogged arteries. William 
George, chief executive of Minneapolis-based Medtronic, said that 
by acquiring Arterial Vascular, Medtronic would have the ``best-in-class 
products'' in several important types of cardiological devices. Teams 
of Medtronic and Arterial Vascular sales people would jointly promote 
the products to specialized physicians at big hospitals, who are eager 
to try the newest and presumably most effective devices. Many Arterial 
Vascular employees will become instant multimillionaires if, as expected, 
the deal is completed early next year. Medtronic is well acquainted 
with the Arterial Vascular management, headed by Scott Solano, a former 
Medtronic vice president who resigned in 1995 and joined Arterial 
Vascular as chief executive two years ago. Solano will stay on as 
head of the stent business, based in Santa Rosa, Calif., and will 
report to Art Collins, president of Medtronic. Analysts said a downside 
lurked in the possibility that important executives and researchers 
might be overcompensated and thus undermotivated to stay on board. 
``The risk in any acquisition like this is, does the R and D talent 
stay?'' said Vivian Wohl, a senior research analyst at Merrill Lynch. 
Advanced Vascular Engineering, an 8-year-old technology company, helped 
blast Johnson &AMP; Johnson out of market leadership for stents last 
year by improving the design. Kurt Kruger, a health technology analyst 
at Nations Banc Montgomery, said the U.S. stent market is dominated 
by Advanced Vascular, the Guidant Corp., based in Indianapolis, and 
Boston Scientific Corp., based in Natick, Mass. He said Advanced Vascular's 
research pipeline contains ``a proliferation of new products.'' ``Research 
and development are absolutely everything in a marketplace where every 
three to six months you have brand-new generation stents,'' Ms. Wohl 
said. But she said that Guidant and Boston Scientific had a potential 
advantage based on cross-licensing of patents for a guide-wire device 
that is easier to use for delivering the stent through an artery to 
the proper spot. Boston Scientific, however, is distracted by accounting 
problems on two fronts. Its shares plummeted from above $81 in August 
to $40.25 by early November following revelations that its sales in 
Japan had been overstated by tens of millions of dollars. The company 
is also struggling to comply with an SEC ruling affecting companies 
that take big one-time writeoffs in mergers. Boston Scientific had 
planned to do just that in its $2.1 billion purchase last June of 
a medical device unit from Pfizer Inc. ``Advanced Cardiovascular is 
a really good company,'' said Gene Gargiulo, an independent analyst 
who specializes in medical device stocks. But he sees last month's 
big Medtronic merger as primarily driven by financial goals that could 
be compromised. ``Can they digest all this all at once?'' he asked.
