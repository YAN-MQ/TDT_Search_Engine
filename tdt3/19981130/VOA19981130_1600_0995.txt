The U.S. Supreme Court has heard arguments in a case that could affect 
the shape of congressional election districts nationwide and billions 
of dollars in federal financial aid. The Clinton administration asks 
the court to allow statistical sampling in the year 2000 census. The 
administration says statistical sampling will provide a more accurate 
count of minorities and inner city residents who allegedly were under 
counted in the 1990 census. This is VOA News Now from Washington.
