This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather 
forecast" for Tuesday. A cold front will move rapidly off the east 
coast with a little rain or icy mix across northern New England. Showers 
and storms farther to the south. Meanwhile, a front moving into the 
west will bring rain and mountain snow and very strong winds from 
California, Oregon, Washington, across the great basin toward the 
rocky mountains. More wet and windy weather will move into the northwest 
with the second system as well. Highs on Tuesday, 30s and 40s in the 
extreme north and across sections of the great basin, but the south 
remains rather warm. It will cool off a bit in the mid-atlantic region. 
Looking ahead to Wednesday, it's still wet and windy in the northwest. 
On Thursday, some showers will move through the plains toward the 
mississippi river valley while the rain and snow continue in the northwest. 
And then on Friday, scattered showers around the Great Lakes and Ohio 
valley, still wet and snowy with windy conditions in the northwest. 
Don't forget, you can find four-day forecasts for more than 7,200
