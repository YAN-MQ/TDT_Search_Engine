But that's not the big Stones story of the week. The big news is that 
Mick Jagger and his wife Jerry Hall have split again and they may 
divorce. Although there is some confusion as to whether the trouble 
this time is an old one, the singer's other women, or it's a new problem. 
He's reportedly angry that their 14 year-old daughter Elizabeth is 
already following in her mother's footsteps and working as a model. 
We will keep you posted of course.
