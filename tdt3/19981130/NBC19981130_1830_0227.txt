While that was going on in Texas, a new phase of the Brady gun control 
law went into effect across the nation today, instantly expanding 
the kinds of guns covered. The FBI hopes the new system will stop 
illegal gun sales. But as NBC's Pete Williams reports tonight, the 
first day was a stop-and-go effort. Starting today, for the first 
time, anyone wanting to buy a rifle or a shotgun must first undergo 
a background check. Supporters say the new system closes a loophole, 
because the old one covered only handguns, but not long guns, which 
account for half of the roughly 3 million new firearms sold each year. 
We hope to keep guns, both handguns and long guns, long-barreled weapons, 
out of the hands of persons who are not qualified to possess those 
weapons. And starting now, gun sales in pawnshops will also be covered. 
It's all part of the new national instant check system for gun buyers, 
computer checks of state and federal records done by the FBI, unless 
a State already has its own system. And half the states have opted 
to let the FBI do all the checks. In those states today, the system 
sometimes seemed anything but instant. Hello, this is the nics program 
office. May I help you? It took a gun dealer in Tyler, Texas, 2 1/2 
hours this morning just to get through. Ha, ha, it's busy, too. And 
in long island, New York, getting through was only half the problem. 
We're sorry but nics is temporarily out of serice. Please try your 
call again later. But while some were complaining, advocates say the 
new rules don't go far enough since the records don't report everything. 
All of them are reasons to deny gun sales. And the advocates of the 
original Brady law say no matter how the checks are done, there ought 
to be a waiting period. Too many people purchased a gun in a moment 
of anger or despair and then used that gun to kill themselves or someone 
else. The FBI acknowledges there were some start-up glitches. But 
federal law required the new system to start today, in the middle 
of the hunting and Christmas seasons. Pete Williams, NBC news, Washington.
