Opposition lawmakers in India have disrupted the opening of the winter 
session of Parliament, forcing it to adjourn for several hours. The 
adjournment was called as a number of members shouted for the government 
to resign in the face of last week's defeat at the poles. The session 
was the first since the ruling Beretia Janita Party or BJP of Prime 
Minister Atobohari Bajtahi was routed in four state elections.
