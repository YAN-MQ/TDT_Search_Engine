There's a disturbing new report about Iraq. CNN has learned, Iraq 
has continued its efforts to build a better long-range missile, in 
violation of U.N. resolutions. Sources tell CNN, a team of Iraqi missile 
engineers traveled to Romania last may in an attempt to procure advanced 
missile guidance systems. According to Scott Ritter, a former U.N. 
weapons inspector, intelligence agencies of three countries were watching 
the meeting. The covert surveillance was reportedly dubbed operation 
teacup. The U.N. will not acknowledge the existence of the operation, 
and the Iraqi government has said it would not comment until seeing 
the story, which aired last night on CNN.
