Congolese President Luran Kabila is in Libya to brief leader Moamar 
Kadafi on the four-month-old rebellion in Congo Kinshasa. Mr. Kabila 
arrived in Libya from Paris one day after Congolese rebels dismissed 
a cease-fire accord brokered at the Franco-African Summit in Paris. 
Rebel Wanbadiya Wanba said Sunday, that no Congolese cease-fire is 
possible until Mr. Kabila negotiates directly with his rebel movement. 
So far, the President has refused to do so.
