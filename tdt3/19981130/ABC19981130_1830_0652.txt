"On the money" tonight -- the biggest takeover of a U.S. investment 
bank by a foreign bank. Germany's Deutsche bank is buying banker's 
trust for $10.1 billion. The new company will be the world's largest 
financial services firm. The deal is proof that when it comes to foreign 
ownership of U.S. companies, attitudes have changed. Here's ABC's 
Betsy Stark. The takeover of a major American financial institution 
by a German banking giant just a decade ago might have aroused suspicion 
about the dangers of foreign ownership, the fear many Americans felt 
when the japanese bought Rockefeller center. But nowadays, whether 
it's Deutschebank taking over bankers trust, British petroleum buying 
Amoco, or Daimler-Benz merging with Chrysler, most americans seem 
to take foreign ownership in stride. Today, we are the fastest growing 
and the strongest economy in the world. We have some of the most competitive 
companies in the world. And I think that people subconsciously see 
foreigners' desire to invest in the United States as an affirmation 
that America has won the competitive battle. In the last several years, 
Americans have come to see not only the risks but the benefits of 
an increasingly global economy right in their own backyards. Toyota, 
for instance, has brought a lot of jobs to Kentucky and California. 
BMW is one of South Carolina's biggest employers. More and more Americans 
work for foreign companies. More an more Americans make products that 
are sold to foreign companies. People are aware of that in some subtle 
and very important ways. Only a decade after Americans worried about 
Asians taking over their prime real estate, it is Asia that is worried 
about Americans buying up theirs. Just as Japan once took advantage 
of American economic weakness, American companies are now looking 
to take advantage of theirs. Betsy Stark, ABC News, New York.
