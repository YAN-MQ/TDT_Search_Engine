Voters in Switzerland have overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to 
legalize all drugs. The proposal's backers said the plan would get 
rid of organized crime groups who traffic in narcotics. But opponents 
said the measure would turn the country into a haven for drug dealers 
and addicts. Switzerland already has one of the most liberal drug 
policies in Europe. The government supplies heroin to a limited number 
of addicts as a means of reducing crime and encouraging medical treatment.
