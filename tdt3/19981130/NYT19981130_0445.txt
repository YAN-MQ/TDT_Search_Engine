In the past five days, game officials in the National Football League 
have come under attack as much as any time in recent history. Anyone 
wearing stripes had better duck for cover. The scrutiny is a result 
of disputed calls by officials in two games, and the furor has got 
so hot that two owners interviewed Monday said the league should address 
the situation at the owners' meetings next spring. The owners, speaking 
on the condition of anonymity, said the officiating system is good 
but needs to be great, and they suggested the NFL should seriously 
consider hiring full-time game officials. Currently, officials hold 
other jobs too. ``We have, and I truly believe this, the best officials 
in sports,'' one of the owners said, ``but these blown calls are bad 
for the league's image. It's killing us. All I'm saying is maybe we 
can improve things. If we can't, so be it.'' Said another owner: ``What's 
happened in the last few days has been an embarrassment to the league. 
This needs to be fixed.'' The league office moved Monday to address 
one of the issues, the disputed coin toss in last Thursday's Detroit-Pittsburgh 
game. As a result of the Steelers' claim that the coin toss was a 
critical factor in their loss to the Lions, the league revised its 
coin-toss procedure. From now on, the captain of the visiting team 
will be asked to call heads or tails before the coin is tossed, instead 
of during the toss. And two additional game officials, the back judge 
and the field judge, will be present for the toss along with the referee. 
The league did not address the other game that drew unwanted attention 
to the referees, Buffalo's last-second loss to New England on Sunday. 
But George Young, the league vice president who oversees officials, 
stood solidly behind the officials, saying they are the best in sports. 
``What sport would you say has better officials than we do?'' Young 
asked. ``I would say none. We have the most diligent officials in 
sports.'' Nevertheless, the recent spate of controversial rulings 
has again raised the issue of instant replay and has some teams fuming. 
The incident in Detroit came at the beginning of overtime. Replays 
clearly showed Steelers running back Jerome Bettis calling ``tails'' 
for the coin toss in overtime. But Referee Phil Luckett said he first 
heard ``heads'' and awarded the ball to Detroit. The Lions then drove 
for the game-winning 42-yard field goal. In announcing the procedural 
change Monday, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the conflicting accounts 
of the incident ``do not resolve the matter'' and added that ``our 
new procedure should make certain that the Thanksgiving Day incident 
is not repeated.'' The farce led to joking during opening coin tosses 
over the weekend. In St. Louis, Atlanta linebacker Jessie Tuggle showed 
up with a placard that said ``heads'' so that Referee Ron Winter would 
not be confused. In Oakland, Referee Ron Blum asked Washington's Darrell 
Green to call the toss. Green said ``heads,'' and Blum asked, ``Are 
you sure?'' But what happened in Buffalo was no laughing matter, particularly 
to the Bills. Their game against New England was crucial because if 
they had won, they could have kept pace in the American Football Conference 
East and pushed the Patriots further behind in the playoff race. Buffalo 
led, 21-17, late in the game, and two crucial calls helped the Patriots 
eventually win, 25-21. First, officials ruled that wide receiver Shawn 
Jefferson was in bounds on a 10-yard fourth-down catch, which gave 
the Patriots a first down at the Buffalo 26 with six seconds left. 
The Bills say Jefferson was clearly out of bounds. Then the Bills 
were furious about an end zone pass-interference call against safety 
Henry Jones on wide receiver Terry Glenn, which gave New England the 
ball at the 1-yard line with no time on the clock. Tight end Ben Coates 
scored on the next play. ``He wasn't playing the ball, but he did 
make contact with the receiver,'' Referee Walt Coleman said. ``That's 
pass interference.'' As a form of protest, the Bills walked off the 
field as the Patriots lined up for the extra point. They refused to 
return, and the Patriots' place-kicker, Adam Vinatieri, ran for a 
2-point conversion. ``Well, they gave them the game,'' Buffalo Coach 
Wade Phillips said, referring to the officials, ``they might as well 
give them the extra point.'' Said Jones: ``We were robbed. Terry Glenn 
jumped for the ball, but no one even grabbed him.'' The league had 
no comment on the two calls. But Ralph Wilson, the normally stoic 
Bills owner, did. He blasted the officiating, calling it the worst 
he has ever seen and adding that he did not care if he was fined by 
the league for his comments _ which he might be. Some team officials 
say that only instant replay can improve the system. But Young, who 
has long been an opponent of it, said instant replay might not have 
applied to either call in the Bills game, especially the play in which 
Jefferson was ruled in. ``It was a pretty tight call,'' Young said. 
``Suppose we had instant replay _would it change that call? I don't 
know. I don't know if the replay was that clear.'' Does Young think 
the league will go to full-time officials, like professional baseball, 
basketball and hockey? ``Our system works well the way it is,'' Young 
said. ``We have a great system.''
