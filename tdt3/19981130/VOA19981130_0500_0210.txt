Cambodia's Parliament has given an overwhelming vote of confidence 
to Prime Minister Hun Seng's new coalition government. 99 members 
in the 122-seat legislature voted in favor of the conference motion. 
The parties of Hun Seng and his coalition partner Prince Norodam Ronoreid 
control a large majority of the seats in Parliament. The Prince, under 
the terms of the coalition deal was named President of the National 
Assembly last week.
