A star-studded album recorded to raise money for victims of the Aug. 
15 Omagh bombing, Northern Ireland's worst terrorist attack, went 
on sale Monday in Britain. The album, ``Across The Bridge Of Hope,'' 
features stars such as U2, Van Morrison, Sinead O'Connor and Boyzone, 
and includes a reading by actor Liam Neeson of a poem written by 12-year-old 
Shaun McLaughlin, who was killed in the attack. The boy's poem about 
peace in Northern Ireland inspired the title of the album. The car 
bomb planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents killed 29 people 
and injured 370. Another 2,000 people _ many of them suffering from 
mental trauma _ have visited their doctors since the attack, say administrators 
of the fund established to help survivors and dependents of those 
killed. The fund is expected to reach about 5 million pounds (dlrs 
8.3 million). It has received 850,000 pounds (dlrs 1.4 million) so 
far, and several groups have pledged more.
