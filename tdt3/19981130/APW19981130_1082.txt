The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man in waters off Haiti after his twin 
engine aircraft lost power and crashed into the ocean. Emmanual G. 
Ducheine, a Haitian citizen, was rescued 25 miles (40 kilometers) 
northwest of Isle de la Tortue, Haiti. Ducheine, 45, lives in Miami. 
The Coast Guard was notified Sunday morning after Ducheine called 
in a distress signal to another aircraft saying that he had experienced 
simultaneous fuel pump failure in both engines. Ducheine left from 
North Perry Airport in Pembroke Pines. He planned to make stops in 
Great Inagua, Bahamas, and Cap-Haitien, Haiti, according to records. 
A C-130 airplane, an HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter and an HU-25 Falcon 
jet were involved in the search. The C-130 found Ducheine floating 
in a life raft late Sunday afternoon. Ducheine was then transported 
by helicopter to Grat Ingua, Bahamas, where he was in good condition, 
said Petty Officer Gibran Soto. The plane had not been recovered Monday 
afternoon. ``They knew where he went down, which helped a lot,'' Soto 
said.
