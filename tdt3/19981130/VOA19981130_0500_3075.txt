The Washington Post reports that historians and lawyers researching 
class action suits for former prisoners of war have found evidence 
that major US automakers collaborated with Nazi Germany. One Washington 
attorney says legal action is pending against Ford Motor Company and 
General Motors. The paper sites a 1945 US Army report saying that 
Ford's German affiliate served as an arsenal of Nazism in supplying 
military vehicles with the consent of Detroit-based Ford. The Post 
says a book due out next year will accuse GM of playing a key role 
in Hitler's invasion of Poland and the Soviet Union. Both automakers 
strongly deny the allegations.
