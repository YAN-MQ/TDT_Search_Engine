There was a wacky ending to New England's wild 25-21 win over Buffalo. 
The bills had the game locked up, until a 25-yard pass interference 
call gave the Patriots the ball at the Buffalo one with no time left. 
Since a game can't end on a defensive penalty, drew Bledsoe used the 
extra play to loft a game-winning td pass to Ben coates.
