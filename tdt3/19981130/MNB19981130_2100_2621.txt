Three years ago when the Seattle public school board was looking for 
a new superintendent, they hired a man roundly described as remarkable. 
John Stanford, a retired military general who decided his next battle 
would be reviving the city's public school, then came an unexpected 
battle for his life. He was diagnosed with leukemia, fought it until 
the end came this weakness. Mike Boettcher reports on the sadness 
felt in Seattle. They came with Flowers and candle, children, parents 
and teachers, all for john Stanford. According to friends, a man who 
challenged them like a preacher challenges sinners to do good again. 
An incredibly great man. One-of-A-kind. Cancer killed him at age 60. 
For seven months, he fought it with the same vigor he displayed in 
turning around seattles public schools. Six weeks ago when we visited 
him, it seemed an experimental treatment was beating his leukemia. 
I never considered that I would not live. As was his nature, he wouldn't 
talk much about himself. He wanted to talk about his kids, the students. 
Children don't learn from people who do not love them. Seattle took 
a risk three years ago when it hired Stanford, a man with no education 
experience this former general came ready to wage war against apathy, 
underachieving students, complacent parents and an indifferent community. 
Test scores soon rose. Seattle was becoming proud of its schools again. 
Stanford's message, love them and lead them played on the national 
stage of the democratic convention. I am a crusader for American's 
children. He would use canser to benefit Seattle's schools. He used 
the money to buy school books for the children. Remembering me is 
not as important as what we have built in every individual child. 
That's what's key to me. He got those books. Against his wishes, Seattle 
still honors him with Flowers, the only order his troops, students 
and family ever disobeyed. Mike Boettcher, NBC news, Seattle.
