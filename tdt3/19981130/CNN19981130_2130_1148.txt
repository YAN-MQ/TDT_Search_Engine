"Headline Sports" is next. Later toying around with some of Hollywood's 
recent hits. Hi, I'm expecting a fax. Room 212 wants the ammunition 
to deal with her toughest clients. Nothing? Davies, 212. I called 
earlier. Right, fax. It hasn't come yet. I need it for a meeting. 
Excuse me, miss Davies? It just came in. Thank you, so much. Good 
morning, everyone. Business services by Marriott. The day we started 
business, we had over 30 years experience as the world leader in satellite 
services and systems. We are the world leader in digital satellite 
television. And, the world's leading provider of private business 
networks. Introducing Hughes, a familiar name with a brand new focus. 
When you need the best in satellite and wireless communications. We 
make it happen.
