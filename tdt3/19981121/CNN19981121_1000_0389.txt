An enormous tobacco settlement with 46 states could leave some gaps 
the federal government might try to fill. California senator Dianne 
Feinstein says she already has asked the Senate judiciary committee 
to consider drafting legislation, to address national policy issues 
not covered by the settlement. Under the state deal, tobacco companies 
will pay $206 billion and give up advertisements on billboards, public 
transportation, and apparel. And they will cover the health costs 
of treating smokers and help fund anti-smoking education programs. 
The tobacco industry says it will sign the deal Monday. It is warning 
the price of cigarettes may rise 40 cents a pack to help pay for the 
settlement.
