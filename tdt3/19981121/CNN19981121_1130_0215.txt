President Clinton says he does not want to overreact to Iraq's latest 
dispute with U.N. weapons inspectors. Inspectors are still on the 
job today, a week after Iraq's promise to cooperate. But Iraqi officials 
are refusing to comply with chief weapons inspector richard Butler's 
request for several documents. Iraq calls the request "provocative 
rather than professional" and continues to insist on a comprehensive 
review of its weapons. U.S. national security adviser Sandy Berger 
says the United States remains ready to take military action if Iraq 
doesn't cooperate.
