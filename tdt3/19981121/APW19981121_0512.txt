In the latest tangle in the land-for-security accord, the Palestinians 
said Saturday that they did not consider 150 criminals released by 
Israel as part of those detainees to be freed under the agreement. 
The Palestinians said they protested to the United States over ``a 
violation of the accord'' since Israel released on Friday mostly car 
thieves and drug dealers and only 100 prisoners accused in the struggle 
against Israeli occupation. Palestinian police continued on Saturday 
to move into the 9.1 percent of the West Bank they received a day 
earlier but the latest disagreement threatened to jeopardize the release 
of 500 more Palestinian prisoners. Under the U.S.-brokered Wye Memorandum 
signed last month, Israel is slated to withdraw from a total of 13 
percent of the West Bank by the end of January in tandem with Palestinian 
steps against anti-Israeli activity. The pullbacks in three phases 
will grant the Palestinians partial or total control over 40 percent 
of the area. ``We didn't go to Wye River to use the services of (U.S. 
President Bill) Clinton to release car thieves,'' said Ahmed Tibi, 
a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. ``This is not fair 
and shows bad intentions.'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 
office said in response that the peace accord did not stipulate that 
Israel free prisoners with Jewish ``blood on their hands.'' In completing 
the transfer of the territory, Palestinian police entered on Saturday 
seven of the 36 villages located between the cities of Jenin and Nablus. 
Only a smattering of residents in the farming communities showed up 
to welcome the police who had already operated unofficially in much 
of the area. But in the village of Tubas, the police jeeps were escorted 
by scout troops playing drums and onlookers waving red, green, white 
and black Palestinian flags. The withdrawal isolated several Jewish 
settlements and Israeli troops began reinforcing them. In Ganim, a 
community of 51 families, many were thinking about leaving. ``If this 
place turns into an armed camp, it's not the way we wanted to live,'' 
said Ilan Amar, who sells car paint in the Israeli port city of Haifa. 
The Palestinian Cabinet called on Israel in a meeting overnight to 
abide by the Wye Memorandum and cease Jewish settlement activity in 
the West Bank. Israeli settlers, who oppose the land-for-peace deal 
with the Palestinians, have been trying to take as many West Bank 
hilltops to prevent them from being handed-over in the future. A statement 
from the Palestinian Cabinet said ``settlements would destroy the 
peace process, stability and security.'' Israeli soldiers were slated 
Saturday night and Sunday to complete the demarcation of the borders 
of those areas transferred to the Palestinian Authority, Israeli media 
reported. Arafat told reporters in Gaza Saturday that the withdrawal 
was ``a good beginning in the implementation of what was agreed upon.'' 
The Palestinian leader sent congratulations on Friday to those residents 
now under his authority and asked that they ``raise the Palestinian 
flag.'' By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more pullbacks 
under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or sole jurisdiction 
over 920 square miles (2,382 square kilometers). Israel captured the 
West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. Apparently as part 
of a Palestinian crack down on anti-Israeli extremists, Palestinian 
police arrested on Saturday Ismail Haniya, a leader in the Islamic 
radical group, Hamas, relatives said. Since the signing of the accord, 
Palestinian police have arrested hundreds of members of Hamas, which 
opposes the peace process and has taken responsibility for several 
deadly attacks on Israelis.
