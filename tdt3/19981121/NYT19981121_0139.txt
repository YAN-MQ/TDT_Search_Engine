The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 22: New York 
Gov. George Pataki took an important stand by proposing new state 
legislation to protect women and doctors against violence at abortion 
clinics. The Democratic-controlled state Assembly has passed similar 
legislation every year since 1993, but it has repeatedly died in the 
Republican-controlled Senate. The governor has voiced support for 
such legislation in the past. Now he must demand that the Senate take 
up and approve this measure. Pataki's proposed bill will be patterned 
on the 1994 federal law that makes it a crime to block access to medical 
facilities. It will provide penalties of up to four years in prison 
for anyone who ``intentionally injures, intimidates or interferes 
with'' anyone entering a clinic. It will also allow private individuals 
and local district attorneys to bring civil lawsuits for damages against 
those who unlawfully obstruct clinic access. In addition, the governor 
will create a task force of law enforcement officials, clinic administrators 
and advocacy groups to coordinate efforts to ensure greater safety. 
The murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian, who had been threatened and harassed 
at the clinic in Buffalo where he performed abortions before he was 
shot in his home, might not have been prevented by a new law. But 
the battle against anti-abortion extremists must take place on several 
fronts. Political condemnation of violence is just as important as 
creating new legal penalties. Some might say Pataki's move is intended 
to burnish his credentials as a moderate as he positions himself for 
a possible national campaign. But those urges show that he is sensitive 
to the importance of the abortion issue to women and moderate voters. 
His attention to this issue sends a powerful message that New York 
will not tolerate terrorism. The response from some anti-choice advocates 
is disturbing. Michael Long, chairman of the state's Conservative 
Party, characterized Pataki's announcement as ``pandering to the worst 
abortion extremists.'' But it is not extreme to protect women and 
doctors from threats and actual injury. Anti-abortion protesters are 
free to voice their views, but they cannot be allowed to prevent others 
from exercising their constitutionally protected rights.
