A Southern African Development Community official on Saturday blasted 
Congolese rebels for childish conduct at peace negotiations, saying 
they had demanded their country be divided with two separate governments. 
The outburst from Kaire Mbuende, executive secretary of SADC, came 
on the second day of the latest in a series of attempts to settle 
a nearly four-month-old civil war in Congo. Mbuende spoke as foreign 
ministers from South Africa, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia and Botswana 
waited for the rebel delegation's hour-late arrival, the South African 
Press Association reported. The gathering reached agreement on a draft 
cease-fire agreement on Friday, although any agreement is unlikely 
to carry much weight until Congo President Laurent Kabila's government 
meets face to face with the rebels. Kabila has refused to do so. Last 
minute changes proposed by the rebels on Saturday were not made public, 
but Mbuende's comments indicated talks ended abruptly on Friday after 
the rebels demanded their country be partitioned. ``We think that 
this behavior is tantamount to that of bandits and not statesmen,'' 
Mbuende said Saturday. ``They behave like spoilt children and they 
think we owe them something and we have to run after them.'' Despite 
the seeming disparity between the rebels and the negotiators, Rebel 
leader Bizima Karaha told journalists on Saturday that his movement 
would now ``seriously embark on the peace process''. Karaha on Friday 
said insurgents have enough weapons to keep fighting until the government 
is toppled. Countries that are backing Kabila with weapons and troops 
_ Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola _ did not attend the negotiations. 
Kabila came to power last year after leading a rebellion that overthrew 
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He now is confronted by a rebel force composed 
of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and opposition 
politicians. Kabila blames Rwanda and Uganda, who are backing the 
rebels, for the war.
