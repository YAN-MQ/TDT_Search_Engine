If you were looking for pro basketball on television but couldn't 
find it, this was day 144 of the NBA lockout. And though they've agreed 
to meet again next week, there's no settlement in sight. NBC's Jim 
Avila reports from the home court of the NBA's defending champs. The 
greatest show on earth in Chicago -- The greatest show on earth is 
normally Michael Jordan's NBA champion Bulls. But these days, it's 
the ringling brothers circus that fills the united center. No Bulls,but 
plenty of tigers elephants and horses. And the eight-footer in the 
house doesn't play the game. I'm glad the circus is here, but I think 
it's a shame that they haven't resolved their differences, because 
we need to see some basketball here in chicago. Friday's talks between 
players and owners in New York City showed some progress, but hopes 
are fading for a settlement in time to have games before Christmas. 
You know I guess there's a slogan -- "the sight of guillotine improves 
your hearing," and I guess maybe we're hearing each other a little 
better, because the guillotine is being sharpened. We as players definitely 
don't want the season to be canceled. And I think the owners don't 
want the season canceled. Some players have been working out on their 
own scrimmaging amongst themselves. I don't care about the owners. 
I feel bad for the players, number one, and the fans, number two. 
We're not gonna sign a bad deal just to appease the fans. Restaurants 
like this one down the street from the Bulls Arena also miss the fans. 
We're getting hurt. I know we're getting hurt. So is the cafe across 
the street from Madison square garden in New York. We lose money. 
We lose business. We lose customers. He figures the lockout is cutting 
profits up to 30%. And even nonprofit businesses are hurting. Charities 
say NBA fund-raisers are missed. It hurts us to the tune of thousands 
of dollars. One of the few bright spots, less competition for women's 
basketball. The American basketball league says attendance is up. 
Former NBA coach Jim cleamons enjoyed a sellout at the condors opening 
home game. Normally these fans may or may not be going to a Bulls 
game, but it certainly gives us an opportunity to capture them and 
let them know what we're trying to do. But for now, the only basketball 
Chicago fans can see on the bulls home court is a power game. Jim 
Avila, NBC news, Chicago.
