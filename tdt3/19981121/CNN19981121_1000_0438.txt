A strong area of low pressure continues moving across the western 
United States with showers and rain from the coast of Washington and 
Oregon, spreading inland to Idaho and Montana. A second area of low 
pressure heads towards James bay, so portions of ontario and Quebec 
could see heavy snow as we go through the weekend. A cold front moves 
into southern Florida and becomes stationary. Look for showers and 
a few thunderstorms from lake okeechobee southward and from near New 
Orleans into the gulf of Mexico. High temperatures will be in the 
30s, 40s and 50s for the eastern U.S. with 40s and 50s for the Rockies. 
60s and 70s are expected for the southern tier as far northward as 
western nebraska. You'll see 80s across the Florida keys. The extended 
forecast includes heavy rain on the northwest coast, with rain and 
thunderstorms through the Mississippi valley and the Great Lakes. 
On Tuesday, showers continue spreading eastward into portions of Utah 
and nevada, with the rain in the northeast headed into New England. 
Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms are possible in the Mississippi 
valley by Wednesday. The extended forecast for more than 7,000 cities
