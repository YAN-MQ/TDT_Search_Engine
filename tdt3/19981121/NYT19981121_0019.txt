Fearing that the season was in jeopardy, National Basketball Association 
players and owners resumed negotiations Friday for the first time 
since Oct. 28. In their longest bargaining session during the nearly 
five-month-old labor impasse, both sides made compromises. The concessions 
were made over the proposed implementation of an escrow arrangement. 
The talks, which began at 10:30 a.m. at a Manhattan hotel and continued 
until 10:45 p.m., struck a chord of optimism unseen in the NBA's labor 
dispute since late last month. ``I would say there's been some movement 
on both sides,'' NBA Commissioner David Stern said Friday night. When 
told of Stern's assessment, Danny Schayes, the vice president of the 
National Basketball Players Association, said: ``That sounds about 
right. There have been compromises.'' No plans were made Friday night 
for full bargaining teams to meet again over the weekend, but there 
was the possibility that the chief negotiators on both sides would 
speak. The players who attended Friday's sessions planned to update 
their teammates Saturday on the progress made. The feeling was that 
both the players and the owners wanted to digest the new proposals 
before meeting again in a full session. ``No one is against some new 
ideas, but there is some serious fundamental differences of the way 
the two sides view the issues and approach them,'' Stern said. ``I'm 
optimistic that there'll be a deal, but the question is, after how 
much more damage to our prospects?'' As to whether an agreement could 
be struck by next week, Stern replied, ``I don't think so.'' Still, 
the atmosphere surrounding the negotiations was more congenial than 
in the past. Patrick Ewing, the union's president, joked with owners 
between sessions, and neither the owners nor the players engaged in 
the rhetoric and posturing that had characterized recent sessions. 
Whether the progress will eventually amount to the league ending the 
lockout, now in its 143rd day, remains to be seen. But any softening 
of stances on either side was seen as productive toward bridging the 
vast economic chasm. Implementing the escrow arrangement is considered 
one of the biggest stumbling blocks in negotiations, along with limiting 
high-end salaries. The escrow plan would take effect in the second 
or third year of the proposed deal and would entail the players putting 
aside a set amount of their salaries at the beginning of the season. 
Once a percentage of salaries paid out to players had been exceeded 
_ somewhere between 50 percent and 60 percent of the league's $2 billion 
annual revenue _ the money would be used to pay the owners back. The 
union had previously proposed putting 10 percent of the salaries of 
all players except those making the minimum into an escrow fund at 
the beginning of the season. Once a revenue split is determined, the 
owners want the players to pay back all the money over that figure. 
Participants in the meeting on each side said they had moved a couple 
of percentage points off their desired revenue split, but it was unclear 
what those numbers were. The owners had been asking for a 50-50 share 
of total revenue, while the players wanted to make as much as 60 percent. 
The owners also agreed to accept, with several conditions, the idea 
of a limit on the amount of escrow tax that could be withheld from 
players' paychecks in the fourth, fifth and sixth years of a proposed 
seven-year deal. ``On a couple of items, the parties reached out to 
each other on some previously hardened positions,'' Stern said. ``We 
also discussed a wide range of issues that somehow hadn't been fully 
discussed before _ and that have to be discussed _ in order for us 
to bust our way through to a deal.'' Yet even with progress, the feeling 
was that the season would not start until the first week of January 
at the earliest.
