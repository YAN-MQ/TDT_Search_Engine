As the FBI marks its 90th anniversary, the agency is opening its doors 
to more women and minorities. Pierre Thomas has the story. The FBI 
of old, as depicted in the 1960s television series. Agents, all white 
males, make the arrest. Backseat, I see you! 1998. A female agent 
in training fires at a would-be suspect. The face of the nation's 
best-known law enforcement agency is undergoing a Cultural transformation. 
Turn around, slowly, turn around. More women and minorities are joining 
the FBI than ever before. Keep your head turned this way, okay? Don't 
move. Prior to 1973, there were no women agents. But the ranks of 
female agents has more than doubled in the last decade, and today, 
over 1,800 of the FBI's 11,000-member force are women. Come out with 
your hands up, we have a warrant for your arrest. The number of Hispanic 
agents has also jumped, from 145 to 807 from 1977 to today. Stand 
up. And the number of black agents has grown -- from just 135 to 646 
over the same period. Progress, yes. But how much? What they're not 
doing is promoting after they get in. David Shaffer represents 500 
African-American agents in a class action lawsuit against the FBI. 
The charge? Racial discrimination. We brought these concerns to the 
bureau in 1991, they agreed to fix them. Here it is, 1998, and nothing 
has changed. I don't agree that nothing has changed. I think the statistical 
record -- which is not by itself dispositive -- really beliesthe conclusion 
that nothing has changed. We are still overhauling our promotional 
system, and I'm committed to ensuring all those obligations are undertaken. 
While some skeptics remain, many minority and female recruits believe 
the bureau wants them to succeed. The FBI says there's now diversity 
at the highest ranks. And they say with an expanding global mission, 
diversity is now a Necessity. Pierre Thomas, CNN, Washington.
