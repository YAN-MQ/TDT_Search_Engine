Malaysians angry over U.S. Vice-President Al Gore's comments praising 
anti-government activists can now call in to register their protest. 
Calls to two phone numbers published in the government-backed New 
Straits Times daily Saturday are answered by operators who are compiling 
a list of all those offended by the remarks. An operator who answered 
a call said the service was not run by the government. He said he 
was under orders not to divulge the name of the person providing the 
service or to identify himself. The list of the callers' names will 
be published in a local newspaper, the operator said. In a speech 
this week, Gore expressed support for Malaysia's political reform 
movement started by jailed former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. 
There was an international outcry when Anwar appeared at his arraignment 
in September with a black eye and bruises, the result of an apparent 
beating while in police custody. While Anwar is being tried for abuse 
of power and illegal sex acts _ charges that he denies _ the government 
has arrested several hundred of his supporters for participating in 
rallies calling for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation. 
Anwar's trial resumes Monday after a weeklong recess to avoid clashing 
with the summit of leaders from members of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum. Gore was in Kuala Lumpur to stand in for President 
Clinton during the APEC meeting. On Friday, U.S. Ambassador John Malott 
defended Gore, saying he had only called for democracy and was not 
inciting people to violence, as some Malaysians have accused him of 
doing. Malott said Malaysia could not be called a democracy just because 
it held elections. Mahathir, now Asia's longest-serving leader, has 
been in power for 17 years. ``Democracy is not simply having elections,'' 
Malott said. ``Stalin held elections. Even Hitler held elections. 
Democracy is a process of allowing all views to be heard, of allowing 
the competition of ideas.'' Meanwhile, the head of the Malaysian Islamic 
Youth Movement, Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman, said in a statement issued 
Saturday that Malaysians do not need any interference from abroad, 
especially by the U.S.
