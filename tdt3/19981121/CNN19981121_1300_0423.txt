Experts predict a smoldering Mexican volcano will erupt with less 
intensity than previously feared. Researchers have spotted lava slowly 
flowing from the Colima volcano. If it continues, a nearby village 
is at risk. All 140 residents have been evacuated and will have to 
wait before being allowed back home. An eruption in 1913 shattered 
windows and spewed ash for several miles.
