A week after Iraq agreed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors, 
there are signs another tug-of-war is erupting. Iraqi officials have 
sent the chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler a Letter that 
says his request for documents is provocative, rather than professional. 
Weapons inspections are continuing though, and tensions in Iraq are 
lessening. Jane arraf reports. After two weeks of mounting tension, 
relief. Iraqis living in perilous times enjoyed a day off free from 
crisis -- the first since their government agreed to resume cooperation 
with UNSCOM and the U.S. called off a threatened strike. All the people 
in Iraq is now happy. So you're happy? Yes, sir, I'm happy. Why are 
you happy? I'm happy because there is no -- no weapons, anything. 
At U.N. headquarters, weapons inspectors tried to make up for lost 
time. Teams of monitors, who were sidelined for the past two weeks 
while Iraq banned inspections, went out to inspect potential weapons 
sites. Baghdad, in the past, has complained that inspections should 
take a rest on fridays along with the rest of this Muslim country. 
But Iraq says it's been going out of its way to be accommodating. 
In New York, the U.N.'s chief weapons inspector said it could take 
a month before he could certify that Iraq has carried out its promise 
to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM. I have given them a list of 
what's required. It's a relatively short list in the missile and chemical 
area. Biology is a bigger problem. Everyone knows that. But, you know, 
they can't complain of lack of clarity. Sanctions-hit Iraq is complaining 
that Butler is dragging out the process of determining that Iraq has 
destroyed its banned weapons -- a job that was supposed to last six 
months but has taken more than seven years. Iraqis say it's a U.S. 
plot to keep the trade ban in place. "There are no weapons left here. 
Sanctions have to end," said ubla um firas. She was looking for bargains 
at the Friday used book market, which has boomed since sanctions. 
It's been only three days since the inspectors got back to work -- 
too soon to tell whether the latest agreement will hold. But Iraqis 
at least are hoping for a few more peaceful fridays. Jane arraf, CNN, 
Baghdad.
