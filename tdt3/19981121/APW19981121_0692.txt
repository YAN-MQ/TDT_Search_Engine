After a controversial weeks-long delay apparently caused by political 
concerns, the first teams of Cuban doctors arrived in Nicaragua on 
Saturday to help treat victims of Hurricane Mitch. The conservative 
government of President Arnoldo Aleman had accepted only food and 
medicine from Cuba, saying it couldn't transport doctors to the areas 
affected by the storm. But the government _ whose relief efforts have 
been sharply criticized _ accepted the help of doctors from other 
countries. On Friday, the government said it would accept health teams 
Cuba had offered earlier this month. Cuba's Vice Minister of Health, 
Abelardo Rodriguez, accompanied the 22 doctors organized in six medical 
brigades as they landed at Managua's international airport. The teams 
were met by Maria Angeles Arguello, Rodriguez' Nicaraguan counterpart, 
who said they would help in ``prevention and control of diseases'' 
in hard-hit northern provinces of Chinandega, Nueva Segovia and Esteli. 
The rejection of Cuban doctors appeared to stem from the bad relations 
since Aleman was elected president last year. Cuba was a strong ally 
of Nicaragua's Sandinista government of the 1980s, which Aleman had 
opposed and which had imprisoned him. Aleman has maintained tight 
relations with the Cuban exile community in Miami, which strongly 
opposes Fidel Castro. The rejection of the Cuban doctors was sharply 
criticized by Nicaraguans, some of whom noted that even the staunchly 
anti-communist Somoza regime permitted Cuban doctors to help after 
a 1972 earthquake struck Managua, killing 10,000 people. Nicaragua's 
Health Ministry said it asked Cuba for help this week, after some 
of the transportation difficulties were resolved. Nicaragua has had 
outbreaks of diarrhea, dengue, cholera and other diseases, many stemming 
from the river contamination caused by the hurricane.
