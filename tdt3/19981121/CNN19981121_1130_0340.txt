Republicans want President Clinton to come up with a concrete plan 
to reform social security. Representative Bill Archer of Texas called 
for White House action in the weekly GOP radio address. He said it 
would be much hearter to reform the retirement safety net without 
a specific plan from the Clinton administration. Today, I call on 
President Clinton to submit to Congress a specific plan to save social 
security. Without a specific plan from the president, this very difficult 
job will become much harder -- some might say it could be impossible. 
If President Clinton believes he can get this done without his leadership 
in submitting a specific plan, he may be making the biggest miscalculation 
of his presidency. The White House hasn't yet said whether it will 
try to come up with a type of plan the GOP is seeking.
