Jeremy Mayfield outraced rising star Jeff Gordon Saturday to set a 
track record and win the pole position for the dlrs 1 million NASCAR 
Thunder Special Coca-Cola 500, a season-ending exhibition race in 
Japan. Mayfield, ranked seventh on the Winston Cup driver standings 
of the year, posted the fastest qualifying lap of 35.116 seconds, 
or 158.799 mph, at the 1.5-mile Twin Ring Motegi in a Mobil 1 Ford. 
He also was fastest at 35.692 seconds, the old record, in Friday's 
practice session. It will be the second pole start this year for the 
29-year-old Mayfield, of Owensboro, Kentucky, who last won the Pocono 
500 at Brooklyn, Michigan, in June. Gordon, at age 27 the youngest 
driver ever to win three Winston Cup championships, had the second-fastest 
lap with a time of 35.122 seconds, or 158.772 mph, in a DuPond Automotive 
Finishes Chevrolet. The resident of Pittsboro, Indiana, has tied Richard 
Petty's modern-era record of 13 victories in a season. The record 
had stood for more than two decades. In the race scheduled for Sunday, 
which offers a top prize of dlrs 105,000, no championship points will 
be awarded. Third-fastest at 35.162 seconds, or 158,592 mph, was Mike 
Skinner, winner of the event last year at the 1.54-mile Suzuka Circuitland. 
He drove a Lowe's Home Improvement Chevrolet. The exhibition race 
this year is the third and final in a three-year contract the NASCAR 
has with the Japanese to promote the race worldwide. Japanese auto 
racing officials said negotiations were underway at Motegi for the 
Winston Cup West to stage a championship series event in Japan starting 
from next season. ``Yeah, we've had a great year,'' said Gordon, who 
almost won his eighth pole of the year and is seeking a 14th win. 
``There's just no word to describe a year like we had. ``Second today 
is great. I didn't think we had a shot at the top three to be sitting 
here. A second is just great. I just wish that Jeremy would've beaten 
me by a little bit more ... not to hurt my feeling.'' ``We sure are 
happy to come around and see No. 12 (his car number) on top of No. 
24 for a change,'' said a jubilant Mayfield. He added that he hopes 
to be ahead of Gordon in the race Sunday. ``I know it's not so easy. 
But that's what we are thinking any way.'' ``So far, there only have 
been two winners in Japan,'' said Skinner, of Susanville, California. 
``I like to win here. It would be pretty neat.'' Skinner was the Winston 
Cup's 40-year-old rookie of the year when he drove to his first victory 
in high-level competition at Suzuka last year. At that time, he started 
in the fourth spot and made a late charge to the front in his Chevrolet 
Monte Carlo. Winston Cup 1997 champion Jeff Gordon missed the Suzuka 
race after he underwent surgery on his vocal chords. In the first-ever 
NASCAR race in Japan _ also at Suzuka _ in 1996, Rusty Wallace was 
the winner. In the race last year, he dropped out on the ninth lap 
after his Ford Thunderbird developed engine trouble. On Saturday, 
Wallace was eighth at 35.503 seconds, or 157.068 mph.
