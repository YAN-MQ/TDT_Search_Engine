In a letter that some City University of New York officials criticized 
as an effort that could curb free speech, the chairwoman of the CUNY 
board rebuked the president of Brooklyn College for remarks he made 
at the June commencement. In the sharply worded letter dated Thursday, 
CUNY Chairwoman Anne Paolucci said she had recently read the commencement 
speech, and she chided Brooklyn College President Vernon Lattin for 
criticizing the board's policies on remedial education in it. ``To 
be honest, I was alarmed by a certain lack of perspective and by your 
open challenge to policies enacted by this Board of Trustees,'' she 
wrote in the letter, which was sent to CUNY's trustees, presidents 
and administrators, as well as to Lattin and his staff. She added, 
``As the president of a CUNY college, I expect you to understand this 
policy and its rationale, to publicly support it and to work to insure 
that it succeeds.'' Copies of the letter were provided to The New 
York Times by people who were concerned by it. Several trustees said 
Friday that they saw the letter as inappropriate. ``It has to put 
the fear of God in the presidents,'' said Edith Everett, a CUNY trustee, 
who said she was writing a response to Ms. Paolucci. ``They're already 
fearful. I feel like this is a police state.'' Herman Badillo, vice 
chairman of the CUNY board, said he was surprised by the scolding 
letter _ and by its wide circulation. ``It looks like you are trying 
to undermine the guy,'' he said. ``If you have a problem, you just 
call him in.'' Other CUNY presidents also expressed reservations, 
saying they feared that the letter would be one more disincentive 
to public discussion. ``I can understand her being upset if she thinks 
a president is not following policy,'' said one president, who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity. ``But for us not to be able to comment 
is very chilling on academic freedom.'' Lattin said Friday that he 
had just received the letter in the mail and had not had time to think 
much about it yet. ``I'm sorry the chairwoman did not like my speech 
and made her opposition so public,'' he said, adding that the speech 
``speaks for itself'' and that he had no other comment. In the speech, 
``A Crisis in American Education,'' Lattin did not refer to City University 
trustees specifically. But he said that politicians wanted to restrict 
access to the university and that ``policy makers are developing specific 
policies that restrict access and reduce equity.'' In May, the trustees 
had voted to bar students who could not pass placement tests in reading, 
writing and mathematics from entering their four-year colleges. The 
decision was widely debated by CUNY's students, faculty and by educators 
outside the university, and is on hold pending a lawsuit over the 
state's open meetings law and the trustees' compliance. In his speech 
the next month, Lattin also said that the state and the country were 
``disinvesting in higher education'' and that ``the great public education 
you received at Brooklyn College _ and could have received at SUNY, 
or the University of Wisconsin or the University of California _ may 
not be available to your children and grandchildren.'' Asked Saturday 
about the criticisms of her letter, Ms. Paolucci said, ``He made public 
comments, and I thought I should remind him that we were addressing 
these things.'' She said she had no further comment. In her letter, 
she said the new remedial education policy ``will permit instruction 
to begin on a higher plane and end on a higher plane, and it will 
move basic skills course work to where it belongs _ at the entry-level 
campuses.''
