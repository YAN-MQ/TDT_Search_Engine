A Kurdish rebel leader was freed in Rome Saturday amid a new barrage 
of protests from Turkey, which wants him handed over as a terrorist. 
Abdullah Ocalan left the hospital where he'd been in custody since 
his Nov. 12 arrival in Italy for a private residence on Saturday morning. 
He told the thousands of Kurds from throughout Europe who are in Rome 
a show of support to return home. ``Go back to your towns and your 
jobs and continue supporting the Kurdish cause,'' he said in a statement. 
Ocalan was freed by a court decision a day earlier that rejected a 
Turkish warrant for his arrest because Italian law forbids extradition 
to countries where someone faces the death penalty. The court said 
Ocalan had to stay in Rome, but that order could be lifted next month. 
Turkey, which is trying him in absentia on capital crimes, was outraged 
and warned Italy once again against granting Ocalan political asylum. 
Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If it does, Turkey will not leave 
this unanswered,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz threatened in Ankara. 
``Italy's biggest error would be to open its arms to the bloodiest 
terrorist in the world,'' he said. Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers 
Party, or PKK, which has fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy 
in southeastern Turkey that has claimed 37,000 lives. The Turkish 
newspaper Hurriyet said Saturday that Libya might offer him refuge 
if he has to leave Italy. Turkey is applying economic as well as diplomatic 
pressure on Italy, its second-largest trading partner. Turkish businesses 
are boycotting Italian products and there were reports the government 
would cancel the purchase of five Italian Agusta helicopters. The 
United States is also pressuring Rome to extradite Ocalan. Italy got 
some welcome backing Saturday in its standoff with Turkey. The European 
Union expressed ``full solidarity with Italy in her determination 
to fully implement her laws and treaty obligations'' and in Washington, 
Human Rights Watch also gave Italy its support. At the same time, 
both condemned PKK violence and Human Rights Watch said Ocalan should 
be ``held accountable for atrocities committed under his leadership.'' 
Germany, home to 500,000 Kurdish exiles, issued a warrant for Ocalan 
in 1990, but said Friday it wouldn't seek his extradition. On Saturday, 
the federal prosecutor issued a new warrant, but said it didn't necessarily 
change Germany's stance. The new warrant accuses Ocalan of murdering 
PKK dissidents and a series of arson attacks in Germany. Anti-Italian 
sentiment was again running high in Turkey and the Italian Foreign 
Ministry on Saturday advised Italians to put off trips to Turkey as 
a precaution. Outraged Turks in Ankara laid black wreaths in front 
of the Italian Embassy Saturday and honked their horns; graffiti denouncing 
the PKK defaced the walls. ``No to terrorism, today and forever'' 
read a banner hung across the boulevard in front of the embassy. In 
an interview with a Turkish newspaper, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema 
warned Ankara that it risks distancing itself from the rest of Europe 
with its harshness toward Italy. Italy had been Turkey's staunch ally 
in its bid for EU membership, a bid that has been unsuccessful, partly 
because Turkey's human rights record is marred by its treatment of 
its 12 to 15 million Kurds.
