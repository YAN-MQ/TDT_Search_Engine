One day after receiving control over more West Bank land, the Palestinian 
Cabinet called on Israel to cease Jewish settlement activity in the 
West Bank and move ahead with the latest Mideast peace accord. An 
Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank went smoothly on Friday, 
giving the Palestinians control over an additional 2 percent of the 
territory and upgrading their authority in 7 percent of the land. 
Israeli settlers, who opposes the U.S.-brokered land-for-peace deal 
with the Palestinians, have been trying to take as many West Bank 
hilltops to prevent them from being handed-over in the future. A statement 
from the Palestinian Cabinet issued early Saturday morning after an 
all-night session in the West Bank city of Hebron said ``settlements 
would destroy the peace process, stability and security.'' The Cabinet 
welcomed the first of three Israeli troop pullbacks but was critical 
of Israel's handling of a Palestinian prisoner release. Israel set 
free 250 Palestinian prisoners Friday, including 150 criminals. Arafat 
had demanded freedom for Palestinians who fought Israeli occupation. 
Friday, Palestinian policemen in the village of Qabatieh leaned out 
of jeep windows and fired their rifles into the air to celebrate their 
takeover of this West Bank farming town after Israel's troop pullback. 
``At last the sun of freedom rises,'' declared a banner at the entrance 
to Qabatieh greeting the convoy of powder-blue jeeps. Arafat told 
reporters late Friday that the withdrawal had ``gone well and according 
to plan.'' The Palestinian leader sent congratulations to those residents 
now under his authority. In a call for unity, Arafat asked that they 
``raise the Palestinian flag.'' By late January, Israel is to have 
carried out two more pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding 
Arafat joint or sole jurisdiction over 40 percent of the West Bank, 
or 920 square miles (2,382 square kilometers). Israel captured the 
West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. Friday's pullback from 
36 small towns and villages earned praise for Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, yet it made his government more fragile than ever. 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright applauded the withdrawal 
and said it showed that the two sides both want to carry out their 
parts in the peace accord signed last month in Washington. However, 
support for the agreement signed last month in Washington is slipping 
in Netanyahu's hard-line government, and Israeli media said Friday 
the prime minister might call early elections in the spring, more 
than a year ahead of schedule. In the month since the signing of the 
accord Israel and the Palestinians have incessantly argued about each 
others' obligations, and Friday's pullback was four days behind schedule 
because of Israeli delays in ratifying the accord.
