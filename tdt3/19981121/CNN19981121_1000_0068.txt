Division over the house impeachment hearings has reached into the 
office of the independent counsel. Ken Starr's ethics adviser, former 
Senate Watergate counsel Sam dash, resigned in protest yesterday. 
Dash says Starr "unlawfully intruded" on house impeachment proceedings 
by serving as an advocate for the inquiry during his testimony Thursday. 
The house Judiciary committee's chairman is defending Starr, saying 
if starr had refused to testify he would have been subpoenaed. In 
south Korea today, President Clinton said he wants to leave the matter 
to the house. My only concern, as I said, is that we get this behind 
us and go on with the business of the country. But I think that the 
less I say about what should happen to me at this point, the better. 
To me, it's, I need to focus on the work I came here to do and others 
need to make that decision. Whether the committee approves articles 
of impeachment or not, two house republicans say anywhere 40 to 50 
of their house GOP colleagues may vote against the motion.
