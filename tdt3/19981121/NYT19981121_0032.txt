When general managers gather each November a couple of weeks after 
the World Series, they spend several days in meeting discussing issues 
that affect their game and their teams. The post-season often is on 
their agenda of topics. ``There are eight clubs that are talking about 
post-season rosters,'' Doug Melvin of the Texas Rangers related, ``and 
the other clubs are saying, `What should I have to worry about that 
for?''' Melvin exaggerated but only slightly. More than eight teams 
had a shot at the playoffs this year, but the number didn't include 
teams that had payrolls below $48 million. As the disparity in payrolls 
grows, that threshold number grows, too. Such a premium is placed 
on the price of winning that relative paupers need not apply for post-season 
spots. This year the Houston Astros were the playoff team with the 
lowest payroll, $48.3 million. Last year the Astros made it with a 
payroll of $34.2 million, the San Francisco Giants with $44.1 million, 
the Seattle Mariners with $45.6 million. In 1996 San Diego got there 
with a $33.4 million payroll, Los Angeles with $37.3 million, St. 
Louis with $37.6 million and Texas with $41.3 million. And as the 
price of winning escalates, the reality of losing sends payrolls plummeting. 
``Not only are payrolls going up, but they're also going down,'' said 
Sandy Alderson, a long-time Oakland Athletics executive who recently 
became Major League Baseball's vice president for baseball operations. 
``We lose sight of the fact that there are some clubs that are giving 
up. ``There are those at $20 million and say to themselves going to 
$30 million doesn't appreciably change their chances, and there are 
those at $30 million who say we're no better off at 30 than at 20, 
so they go down. What you end up with is the extruding of the list 
so that you have some at this end, a lot at this end and no one in 
the middle.'' This year's payrolls ranged from Baltimore's $71.9 million 
to Montreal's $8.3 million. The Orioles, with the only losing record 
among the 13 teams that had payrolls of more than $48 million, clearly 
underachieved, but the Expos didn't have a chance. ``Payroll disparity 
results from revenue disparity and leads to competitive disparity,'' 
Alderson said. Owners and club officials see disparity as the No. 
1 problem facing baseball today. ``One can't help but be concerned,'' 
commissioner Bud Selig said Friday. ``I've heard the competitive balance 
thing for a lot of years, and for a long time it didn't play, but 
as stakes get higher and disparity grows, everyone ought to have concerns.'' 
In the labor agreement that emerged from the 1994-95 players strike, 
the owners and players adopted a revenue sharing plan under which 
the large-revenue teams would pay money into a pool from which the 
smaller-revenue teams would receive money. The aim of the plan was 
to reduce revenue differences. This year the Yankees are expected 
to pay the most, a little more than $11 million, while the Expos will 
receive the most, about $12.5 million. But those payments won't make 
much of a dent on what one baseball official said was a $135 million 
difference between the teams' revenues. Jim Beattie, the Expos' general 
manager, acknowledged that his team probably receives more money than 
anyone else. Without it, he added, ``We might have ended up losing 
money.'' But the fact that the Expos did make some money might rankle 
the clubs that make deposits into the revenue-sharing pool. ``They 
don't like giving us money,'' Beattie said, ``and then we cut back 
and maybe make some money. We're not operating for the good of the 
game right now. We don't want to operate that way. We've been in a 
survival mode. We can't move from that position until we get some 
assurance that we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot all 
the time.'' Donald Fehr, head of the players union, said it would 
be premature to judge the revenue sharing plan before it reaches full-scale 
implementation, which won't happen until the 2000 season. The plan 
was 80 percent operational this season. ``We are not far enough along 
so that we can meaningfully judge what is going to happen,'' Fehr 
said. ``Until we are, we can have our opinions, but they don't mean 
very much.'' Nevertheless, Braves General Manager John Schuerholz 
did not see the current economic system as a solution. ``The economic 
reality,'' he said, ``is that teams that operate in large markets 
and have more income, generate more revenue, sell more tickets, sell 
more sky boxes, sell more executive suites and get better support 
from corporate sponsors are going to have more money to spend. Teams 
that operate in the bulk of our markets, the mediocre size markets 
or small markets, aren't going to have that revenue.'' A new park, 
Jacobs Field, transformed the Cleveland Indians from a low-revenue 
team into a high-revenue team, a potential payee into a payor under 
the revenue-sharing plan. Teams like Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Montreal 
desperately hope new stadiums can work that kind of economic magic 
for them. But the Rangers' Melvin said another general manager put 
the new stadium-as-panacea issue in perspective: ``He said that is 
a short-term solution, but in the long term you'll just be losing 
in a prettier ball park.'' John Hart of Cleveland basically echoed 
that view when he was asked what it would mean for teams with new 
parks if the Yankees got one, too. ``If the Yankees get a new stadium 
and enhanced revenues, it's going to be almost impossible,'' he said. 
``You should see the Yankees every year in the playoffs and that's 
not good for the game.'' Jim Bowden of Cincinnati said low-revenue 
teams don't have the right to expect to be able to spend like high-revenue 
clubs. ``That's not realistic,'' he said. But, he added, ``We have 
to make sure that the difference isn't as large as it is now.'' At 
some point, Bowden said: ``The Players Association has to come forward 
and say `It's a problem for us, too. We're not maximizing the dollars.''' 
Alderson said the union would most likely become involved in trying 
to find a solution to the problem when it becomes in the best interest 
of its membership. ``If they find that 80 percent of their players 
feel they're out of the pennant race even before the season starts, 
then it's an issue that is common to both of us,'' he said. Alderson 
said it may become necessary to allow some teams to move to alter 
their part of the disparity or to change the method of sharing national 
television revenue so that needier teams gain a larger share than 
wealthier teams. Some general managers noted the larger-scale revenue 
sharing the National Football League operates. ``In the NFL,'' Herk 
Robinson of Kansas City said, ``when they pass the pie plate, you 
can close your eyes and take a piece, and it's all the same. Ours 
go from slivers to half pies.'' But Cam Bonifay of Pittsburgh said 
the revenue disparity is ``capitalism in its purest form'' and will 
never be eradicated. ``You have to do your job as well as you can 
through player development and scouting, then get yourself in position 
where you make good baseball decisions,'' he said. ``You might have 
a two- or three-year period where you have this group of players you 
can count on and then add to them and be very competitive for a championship.'' 
Alderson said if the problem can't be solved in a purely economic 
way, it may become necessary to attack the matter from another direction, 
seeking ways to make teams more competitive, for example. Perhaps, 
he said, teams on the wrong end of the competitively imbalanced scale 
could get more players from the amateur ranks or a way could be figured 
out to enable them to keep their salary arbitration-eligible players 
without affecting the arbitration process. Attacking the problem from 
the competitive direction, Gord Ash of Toronto suggested the possibility 
of expanded playoffs. ``It would give more clubs opportunities in 
the post-season,'' he said. ``I think North American fans have grown 
to appreciate playoff situations.'' He admitted the idea in baseball 
bordered on heresy, but he went bravely on. ``I don't see why you 
couldn't go to at least five teams initially,'' he said, meaning the 
addition of one team in each league. ``This year you'd have given 
the Yankees a bye and let the other four knock themselves out. Then 
let the three teams remaining have a round-robin.'' Ash said the playoffs 
could even be expanded up to eight teams in each league but conceded, 
``That's probably too many.'' Bowden proposed his own radical plan 
to make races more competitive. Establish divisions by revenue, not 
geography, he suggested. ``Put Cincinnati in with Pittsburgh and Montreal 
and Florida,'' the Reds' general manager said, ``and let those teams 
have a pennant race. They may win 60 or 70 games, but at least the 
fans know they're in a pennant race. That's not good for baseball, 
but it would be a better solution than clubs being eliminated on May 
20.''
