Brad Pitt gets distracted from an earthly mission in his latest film, 
"meet joe black." It's in movie theaters right now. Bill Tush reports. 
I'm sorry, this is Joe. When media mogul William Parrish introduces 
Joe black, nobody in the film knows what to make of their relationship. 
But the audience is in on it. Joe is an Angel. Unfortunately, the 
Angel of death who has come to take the big guy with him. I have this 
weak feeling in my knees. Superhunk Brad Pitt takes on the guise of 
Joe black. Even though Pitt is a self-proclaimed wise guy, the story 
of "meet Joe black" even got to him. Listen, I can be a cynic a times, 
but, at the end of the day, I was just -- these beautiful thoughts 
on love and family that I actually hold high. It's all in the movie, 
I don't want to make too much of it. But it's all in the movie. Well, 
we'll give a little of the plot away. Joe loves it on earth. And, 
in fact, falls in love with Parrish's beautiful daughter, Susan. I'm 
in love with a man, but I don't know who he is. a relative newcomer 
to big-budget films with big stars, Claire forlani plays Susan. Here 
you are reading with the guy that's supposed to be the hottest guy 
on film. is he? I snuck in there, I snuck that in there. Yeah, you 
did, didn't you? He's pretty great. I was nervous about the whole 
thing. 'cause I just loved the story, you know, and the plot was so 
great. So I kind of found myself jogging around central park burning 
off nervous energy. The total opposite of that is ultracool Oscar 
winner Anthony hopkins. He, of course, is the billionaire father, 
and he is nothing like the guy he plays. He's a man who is on a power 
drive, I think. He's a good man, but I don't have that in my nature 
anymore. I used to. But I don't think I have it anymore. On working 
with Brad Pitt, he's done it before in a film called "Legends of the 
fall." It was nice to see him again after all these years. "How you 
doing, Brad?" He said, "hey, man, Tony." Nice, easygoing lad. As for 
"meet Joe black's" subject matter, leave it to Hopkins to sum it up 
best. My father used to have a saying. He said, if anyone died, he 
said, "well, he learned the big secret." And when I stood at my father's 
deathbed I said, "yeah, you too, dickie boy, you've learned it now, 
and one day I shall as well." Bill Tush, "CNN Entertainment News,"
