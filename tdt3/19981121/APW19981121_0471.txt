A group of hackers broke into an education ministry site on the Internet 
to protest against education reforms, a newspaper said Saturday. A 
group calling itself Net Struggle demanded that Education Minister 
Gerasimos Arsenis negotiate with student groups before imposing the 
reforms, the afternoon daily Ethnos said. Earlier this week, a student 
splashed Arsenis with a glass of water while he was at a restaurant. 
The education reforms, introduced in September, have changed course 
structures at high schools and universities. Students have staged 
occupations and street rallies against the measures, while teachers 
have threatened strikes.
