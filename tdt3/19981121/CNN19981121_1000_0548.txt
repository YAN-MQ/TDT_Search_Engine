Where are many of the nation's dads this weekend? They may be attending 
a convention for stay-at-home dads, part of a growing trend. Patty 
Davis reports. Like thousands of moms every day, Lori Miller reszel 
is heading off to her big corporate job. See you later, alligator. 
Dad, on the other hand, is staying home. It's pretty much of a total 
role reversal of what our generation grew up with. Barry reszel is 
a stay-at-home dad. While mom climbs the corporate ladder at Hewitt 
associates near Chicago, dad climbs the stairs of the family home 
with 21-month-old Christina and 4-year-old Bradford. Life is nothing 
like the 1980s movie "Mr. Mom," where everything goes wrong. Not a 
bit. Reszel has things under control. There are kids to feed. Dishes 
to wash, beds to make. up we go. And diapers to change. Reszel gave 
up his job as a marketing manager four years ago, along with 40% of 
their family income, to care for newborn Bradford. My wife enjoyed 
the corporate life more than I did. She liked her company, her job. 
It was really a decision of we wanted one of us to be home and raise 
the children. Lori is the sole breadwinner. There's a lot of pressure. 
It means you can't just quit. Not that I want to quit, but that means 
that's just not an option. There are now more stay-at-home dads than 
ever before. Experts say as many as 2 million men choose to be at 
home with their children. At-home dad Robert Frank is heading up the 
third annual convention for at-home dads this weekend near Chicago. 
I get an E-mail every day from another father across the country saying, 
"Hey, I didn't know there was another stay-at-home dad out there." 
Reszel is speaking at the convention about his experiences. He plans 
to stay home until the kids finish high school. Just who has the tougher 
job? i do! His wife agrees. But reszel says he wouldn't give up his 
career at home for anything. Patty Davis, CNN, libertyville, Illinois.
