A goal by defender Ichiei Muroi on Saturday gave the Kashima Antlers 
a 2-1 win over Jubilo Iwata in the first of two games for the J-League 
season championship. Defending champion Jubilo's forward Masashi Nakayama 
_ J-League's top scorer for the season _ made the first goal on a 
penalty kick in the seventh minute of the game. The Antlers, the league's 
second-stage winners, tied it in the second half when Kashima's Jorginho 
sent up a pass to team forward Atsushi Yanagisawa on the right side 
of the field. Yanagisawa then kicked the ball in the direction of 
striker Yoshiyuki Hasegawa, who headed in a goal to tie the game at 
1-1. ``I was responsible for the opening goal by Iwata and was waiting 
for a chance to make up for it throughout the game,'' Muroi told Kyodo 
News service. Muroi had been called for a handball violation which 
gave Jubilo the scoring penalty kick. But he netted the winning goal 
20 minutes into extra time, after a ball kicked by teammate Jorginho 
was warded off by goalkeeper Tomoaki Ogami. The Antlers' win at the 
National Stadium in Tokyo before a crowd of 40,263 put the 1996 champions 
two points ahead as both teams prepare for the next game at Kashima 
stadium set for next Saturday.
