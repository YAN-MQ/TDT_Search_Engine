Miss Universe Wendy Fitzwilliam visited with youths at a home for 
neglected and abused children on St. Croix Saturday as part of a five-day 
tour of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The native of Trinidad and Tobago 
was greeted by tourism officials and hundreds of people from around 
the Caribbean who cheered her arrival. Fitzwilliam was the guest of 
honor for Caribbean Unity Week activities that began Monday. The highlight 
of the celebration was to be a Caribbean Unity Ball Saturday night 
at Marriott's Frenchman's Reef Beach Resort hosted by humorist and 
author Paul Keens-Douglas, a fellow Trinidadian. At the Queen Louise 
Home on Saturday, she met briefly with officials and then chatted 
with children and signed autographs. Fitzwilliam met with students 
on St. John and St. Thomas earlier in the week and was scheduled to 
visit the British Virgin Islands before returning to Trinidad on Monday.
