A new name on Wall Street and welcome news from the fed. That's just 
some of what happened in the business world this week. David Daniel 
reports. Daimler-Chrysler made its big board debut this week, the 
new company formed by the merger of the motown mainstay Chrysler and 
Germany's daimler-Benz, maker of Mercedes-Benz. The new auto giant 
reportedly will build a beefier full-size pick-up truck to compete 
with the likes of Ford's F-series super duty line. No word on when 
those might hit the streets.
