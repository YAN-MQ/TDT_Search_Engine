On the last leg of her six-nation tour of hurricane-ravaged Central 
America and the Caribbean, U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton is expected 
in Haiti Saturday for a two-day inspection of U.S.-funded health facilities. 
Aside from the effects of Hurricane Georges, which killed at least 
221 people in Haiti, Mrs. Clinton will see a country that is not only 
the Western Hemisphere's poorest, but also its least healthy. ``The 
future of democracy depends on the capacity of people to live, work, 
and reproduce in good health,'' said Michelle Pierre-Louis, executive 
director of the Haitian Knowledge and Freedom Foundation, which is 
funded by financier-philanthropist George Soros. ``But in Haiti two 
out of three farmers are always sick.'' Forty percent of the estimated 
8 million population _ of which two thirds is rural _ have no access 
to health care and 75 percent have no access to family planning services, 
a recent U.S. Agency for International Development report stated. 
One child of eight does not live to the age of 5, the highest mortality 
rate in the Western Hemisphere, and one of three is chronically malnourished, 
the USAID report stated. Sunday, Mrs. Clinton will visit two U.S.-funded 
health facilities. Bienfaisance Hospital in Pignon, about 60 miles 
(100 kilometers) northeast of the capital, provides curative and preventive 
health care to over 125,000 people as well as training in maternal 
care, literacy, and family planning. The Foundation for Family and 
Reproductive Health, a capital family planning clinic, is a model 
for reducing adolescent pregnancy. The father of computer software 
tycoon Bill Gates, William H. Gates Sr., will accompany Mrs. Clinton 
on her tour. The William Gates Foundation has made a three-year, dlrs 
1.25 million grant to the Family and Reproductive Health clinic and 
a three-year, dlrs 1.5 million grant to Management and Resources for 
Community Health, a suburban Petionville organization which assists 
women of child-bearing age. More than one third of girls and young 
women give birth before the age of 20. Mrs. Clinton will also visit 
the Soros-funded Basil Moreau nursery and primary school in suburban 
Bizoton. The 450 children are given hot lunches and health care and 
their parents benefit from family planning instruction. The United 
States is Haiti's largest international health donor, providing dlrs 
16.7 million in fiscal 1997. Hurricane Georges, which hit Haiti on 
Sept. 22, worsened the country's chronic health problems and poverty. 
Mrs. Clinton has also visited Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and 
Guatemala, hit by Hurricane Mitch, and the Dominican Republic, which 
shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti and also suffered from 
Georges.
