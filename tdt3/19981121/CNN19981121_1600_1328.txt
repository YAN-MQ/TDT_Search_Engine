Well NBA talks broke off early Saturday morning. And for the first 
time during this 143-day lockout, perhaps some progress. Both sides 
moved a little close other to an agreement but still remain far apart 
on a deal. This is a slogan, the side of the guillotine improves your 
hearing. And I guess maybe we're hearing each other a little better 
because the guillotine is being sharpened. The necks that are going 
to be there are going to be the necks of the season.
