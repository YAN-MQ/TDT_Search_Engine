President Clinton is taking a cautious Tone over Iraq's latest refusal 
to cooperate, saying he does not want to overreact. He says he hopes 
Iraq will soon comply with weapons inspectors, because then the lifting 
of U.N. sanctions might come quicker. If they have some independent 
grounds for objecting to some of this information -- that is, if they 
think it's some effort to find out something having nothing to do 
with matters covered by the U.N. resolutions -- They ought to say 
that, and then we should immediately resolve it. But if you -- if 
they want the sanctions lifted because they've complied with all the 
U.N. resolutions on weapons, they have to give the information on 
the documents. And the longer they take to come up with the information 
on the documents and get to the bottom of this, the harder it's going 
to be to convince everyone else that they should get what they want.
