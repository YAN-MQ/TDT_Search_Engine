The belief that Brian Jordan will sign with the Atlanta Braves and 
become their right fielder is erroneous, his agent said Saturday, 
leaving open the possibility that Jordan could still sign with the 
Mets or the Yankees. Jim Turner, the St. Louis-based agent, said the 
race for Jordan remained wide open, though it would not necessarily 
be so for long. ``We will do something by Wednesday,'' he said in 
a telephone interview. The Braves, he emphasized, do not have Jordan, 
an Atlanta resident, wrapped up. ``I don't know where anyone would 
get that opinion,'' Turner said. ``I've refuted it everywhere I've 
gone. Brian was taken aback by it. It clearly is not the case.'' As 
he spoke, Turner awaited a call from Steve Phillips, the Mets' general 
manager. He said he spoke with Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general 
manager, Friday night. He had not received an offer from either. The 
Braves and the Baltimore Orioles had made offers, he said, neither 
for five years. ``We don't have five years yet,'' Turner said. ``The 
fifth year is really important to us. We told the Mets if you give 
us something we haven't received from anybody else, he may be your 
right fielder.'' He could also become the Yankees' center fielder 
if they end negotiations with Bernie Williams and decide not to bring 
Albert Belle into their harmonious clubhouse. ''The impression I got 
from Brian,'' Turner said, ``was he'll know more after they have an 
internal situation over the weekend. He knows what my time-frame is. 
If they haven't reconciled it by next week, it won't include us anyway. 
I'm comfortable with where we are. I know we're going to be done by 
Wednesday.'' Jordan is viewed as a free agent who is on the level 
below Belle, Williams and Mo Vaughn. He is expected to command around 
$8 million to $9 million a year.
