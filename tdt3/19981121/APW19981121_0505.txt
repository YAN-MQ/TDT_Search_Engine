President Nelson Mandela on Saturday took his party's election campaign 
into the last stronghold of apartheid's architect, seeking to undermine 
the National Party's only provincial power base. Speaking to African 
National Congress party contributors, religious leaders and other 
groups at three stops during the day, Mandela sought to reassure non-blacks 
that they had a role to play in the new South Africa. His ANC won 
more than 60 percent of the vote in the first democratic elections 
in 1994 that ended decades of white minority rule. But the National 
Party that ruled during apartheid won the local provincial elections 
in 1994, hanging on to its traditional power base in the Western Cape 
with the support of many mixed-race _ or colored _ voters. The ANC 
rules in seven other provinces, with the Zulu nationalist Inkatha 
Freedom Party ruling KwaZulu-Natal. The 1999 election date has not 
yet been set, but Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is expected to succeed 
Mandela as president. Mandela is stepping down. Mandela wore a T-shirt 
with Mbeki's picture at his separate campaign stops in black and mixed 
race neighborhoods. On Sunday he is to meet with white voters at the 
waterfront. ``We in the ANC have no minorities. We have human beings,'' 
Mandela said. He said the government did not intend to marginalize 
coloreds, Asians and whites, who should stop thinking of themselves 
as minority groups. At one of his stops, Mandela lashed out at vigilante 
groups that use religion to justify their attacks on alleged drug 
dealers _ a thinly veiled reference to People Against Gangsterism 
and Drugs (PAGAD). With large support in the Muslim community, PAGAD 
has targeted alleged drug dealers with bombings and violence, police 
have said. ``They violently assume the role of the law and harass 
and inflict violence against innocent members of their communities,'' 
he said. Mandela vowed that the government would intensify its fight 
against crime. Soaring violence has plagued South Africa since the 
early '90s, as apartheid started being dismantled.
