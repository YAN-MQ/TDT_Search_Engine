Big tobacco companies are scheduled to sign a $206 billion deal Monday 
that settles the health claims of 46 states. It's the biggest civil 
suit payout ever in the U.S. the money will be used to cover the costs 
incurred by state health agencies in treating smoking-related illnesses. 
The deal also calls for an end to companies sign on billboard advertising 
of tobacco products. The price of a pack of cigarettes will probably 
increase 35 to 40 cents, as a result.
