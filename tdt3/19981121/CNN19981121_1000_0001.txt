President Clinton is warning north Korea to allow inspection of a 
suspected nuclear site. & he says further development of north Korea's 
nuclear and missile programs would threaten progress toward better 
relations with the United States. On the first day of a two-day visit 
to south Korea, Mr. Clinton and south korea's president held a joint 
news conference. Mr. Clinton acknowledged U.S. intelligence officials 
are not certain an underground construction project in north Korea 
is part of its nuclear program. The south Korean president added his 
support to the call for inspection. We, the two heads of state, we 
made it clear that we will not tolerate any possible attempt of north 
Korea to proliferate nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of 
mass destruction. And decided to closely coordinate in talking with 
the north on a wide range of pending issues. During his visit to south 
Korea, President Clinton will also meet with business leaders to discuss 
efforts to improve the nation's economy.
