PARIS (AP) - Alexei Yagudin beat Michael Weiss in a quad faceoff to 
take the men's title at the Lalique Trophy figure skating competition 
Saturday with Russians and French sharing the victories. Maria Butyrskaya 
rallied from third to beat Nicole Bobek to take the women's event 
in another Russian win over an American. For France, Sarah Abitbol 
and Stephane Benardis won the pairs program and Ice dancers Marina 
Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat also won. Yagudin landed another clean 
quad jump for the second competition in a row in his impressive routine 
to ``Lawrence of Arabia'' that had him pumping his fists at the end. 
He had seven triples and was superb in choreography the program for 
his fifth victory in five weeks. Landing another quad excited him. 
``You don't know how fanstistic a feeling it is to land one,'' Yagudin 
said. ``With triples I can do from different positions. You go into 
a quad and if your technique is a bit off, you don't do it.'' ``After 
my opening jumps, I try to keep my energy for the quad. You go into 
it and don't think about being artistic,'' Yagudin said. With marks 
of 5.8 and 5.9 throughout, it was perhaps his best routine of a season 
filled with good routines, such as when he landed nine triples at 
Skate America. Weiss, who led after the short program, couldn't match 
the fireworks of Yagudin although he tried. He tried his quad and 
two-footed it slightly according to his coach Audrey Weisiger. Weiss 
has been just missing the quad for the past two years. He fell out 
of a triple axel and had a spill in the middle of steps but had six 
triples. ``I did a good program but the level is incredibly high now,'' 
said Weiss. ``The competition is becoming so strong.'' He ended with 
notes from 5.5 to 5.7 to the music from the Disney movie ``Mulan.'' 
Third went to Canadian Emmanuel Sandhu who moved up from fifth. In 
the women's event, Bobek wanted to rebound with her first international 
victory since 1995 when she won the U.S. title. Since then she has 
had a lot of downs, which culminated with a 17th at the Olympic Games. 
She has since gone back to train with Richard Callaghan, with whom 
she won the national crown. Callaghan coached Tara Lipinski to the 
Olympic gold medal. ``Definitely I think it is a new start. I think 
we accomplished a lot in this competiton and the other competition,'' 
Bobek said. She showed potential in taking the short program on Friday 
but couldn't hold on to the lead in Saturday's free program. Although 
Butyrskaya fell once while Bobek stayed up, the Russian did the more 
difficult jumps and was rewarded with her second Grand Prix victory 
of the season. She won also at Skate America. Bobek's music to ``Evita'' 
was inspiring, her skating was not. Bobek started well with a triple 
lutz-double toe loop combination. Then she proceeded to scale down 
three triple jumps to doubles in her next four attempts. She ended 
with just three triples and was disappointed and wiped tears from 
her eyes while waiting for her marks. ``Of course the emotions came 
out, '' Bobek said. She scored technical marks between 5.0 to 5,4 
and only a little better in the presentation marks. Butyrskaya skated 
well enough to win. Finishing with only four triples, she still scored 
more than two-tenths better than Bobek on nearly every mark to win 
easily. Although Butyrskaya, the European champion and third at the 
world championships, went down on one triple jump and had to put a 
hand down on another, the overall quality and quantity of the jumps 
gave her the win. ``I.m happy with the result, the win but I am not 
happy with the way I skated. I didn't do the things I can do in practice 
or last year at Europeans,'' Butyskaya said. ``But this is my sixth 
competition of the year and I am very tired.'' Third went to Vanessa 
Gusmeroli of France, overtaking Elena Liashenko of Ukraine. Anissina, 
a former Russian, and Peizerat, had a dramatic routine to music from 
``The Man in the Iron Mask '' featuring an unusual move where she 
lifts him off the ice for a long distance down the ice. The world 
runners-up gained marks of 5.7 up to 5.9 for presentation in a performance 
that appeared to be better than their victory in Skate America. Second 
were Italians Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio. Abitbol and 
Bernadis took the pairs event making the fewer mistakes of the top 
couples. To the music of `Acropolis' they were off in individual jumps 
but had some unusual lifts to maintain first. Americans Kyoko Ina 
and John Zimmerman moved from fourth to second although he had trouble 
with jumps. Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event 
is the Cup of Russia in Moscow. The series culminates with the March 
final in Russia, two weeks before the world championships in Finland.
