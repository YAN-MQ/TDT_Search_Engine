Some environmental groups that are fighting to protect California's 
redwoods have targeted the clothing company the gap. They're urging 
members to boycott gap, banana republic and old Navy stores in northern 
California beginning on the busy shopping day after thanksgiving. 
All of those stores are owned by gap, incorporated. The activists 
say the family who owns the gap has refused to ban clear cutting, 
herbicide spraying and logging of areas of old-growth timber on its 
property.
