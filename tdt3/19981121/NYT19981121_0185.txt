Twenty-nine people were arrested early Saturday in a police raid on 
a midtown bar long cited by neighbors as a haven for prostitution. 
Police said the raid on Club Edelweiss, on 11th Avenue near 43rd Street, 
followed a monthlong investigation into drug sales there. Of those 
arrested, 15 were charged with prostitution, two with soliciting prostitutes 
and six with permitting prostitution in the club, said Detective Joseph 
Pentangelo, a police spokesman. Six others were charged with selling 
drugs, he said. Workers at the club were also given summonses for 
the illegal sale of alcohol to minors and for failing to display a 
liquor license, he said. The arrests followed repeated complaints 
by neighbors that many of the transvestite prostitutes in the area 
had worked out of the club since it opened five years ago. It has 
been closed twice before, once after prostitution arrests there in 
1997 and again when the state Liquor Authority temporarily suspended 
its liquor license this year. Barbara Feldt, a community leader who 
lives nearby, said she hoped the arrests would stop the prostitution 
activity. ``But I'm a little jaded by now,'' she said. ``When the 
club was reopened about eight months ago, it was like spotlights were 
put out saying `Come back prostitutes,''' she added. Police officials 
said they intended to go to court to have the club padlocked. Officers 
began looking into activity at the club again after an informant reported 
drug sales there in September. Undercover officers then began to patronize 
the club, making 12 drug purchases from six men between Sept. 12 and 
Nov. 13.
