The presence of one actor puts a powerful spin on another new version 
of an alfred hitchcock classic. Sherry Sylvester reports it's one 
of several specials on television this week. I need to dial 911, I 
need to report a domestic altercation. Christopher reeve makes a remarkable 
comeback in the television remake of Alfred hitchcock's "rear window." 
Reeve plays a severely disabled man who witnesses a crime in progress. 
Next time do us all a favor and don't call 911. I think he killed 
her last night. The only reason to make it was to show what a seriously 
disabled person can do. Otherwise there's no point. It's to send a 
message to the public about the ability within the disability. Daryl 
Hannah and Robert Forster also star. "Rear window" airs on ABC. Happy 
Thanksgiving, everyone! "Disney's one Saturday morning" offers three 
reasons to say thank you. My dad said we'd love to have Thanksgiving 
with your family. Woo-hoo! Join "Disney's Doug," "pepper Ann" and 
the kids of "recess" for two hours of thankful cartoons. Good food, 
good meat, good gravy, let's eat. "Disney's one Saturday morning" 
kicks off on ABC, as well. Good evening Mr. and Mrs. America, and 
all the ships at sea. Dots and dashes and lots of flashes from border 
to border and coast-to-coast. Stanley tucci stars as one of the most 
powerful journalists in history in "winchell." By revealing the secrets 
of the rich and famous, the gossip columnist and radio man had an 
unprecedented role in society. I got an exclusive on fdr, a would-be 
assassin. A what? Assassin. When he had a political agenda, or any 
agenda, he put that forth, and nothing would stop him. "winchell" 
tells all on HBO. Mom, dad, I want you to meet Lucy Anne dean. Meet 
the bedloe family of "St. Maybe," as played by Thomas McCarthy, Blythe 
Danner and Mary-Louise Parker. A family tragedy tests their faith. 
I can't take care of a bunch of kids. I am 19 years old, what kind 
of cock-eyed reg is this? It's the religion on atonement. Anne Tyler's 
"St. Maybe" airs on CBS. Sherri Sylvester, "CNN Entertainment News." 
Hollywood.
