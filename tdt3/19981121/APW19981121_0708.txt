In the latest tangle in the land-for-security accord, Palestinians 
charged Saturday that Israel violated the U.S.-brokered Mideast peace 
deal by releasing 150 common criminals instead of detainees who fought 
Israeli occupation. The Palestinians said they protested to the United 
States over ``a violation of the accord'' since only 100 of the 250 
prisoners released on Friday were accused in the struggle against 
Israel. Palestinian police continued on Saturday to move into the 
9.1 percent of the West Bank they received a day earlier but the latest 
disagreement threatened to jeopardize the release of 500 more Palestinian 
prisoners. Under the U.S.-brokered Wye Memorandum signed last month, 
Israel is slated to withdraw from a total of 13 percent of the West 
Bank by the end of January in tandem with Palestinian steps against 
anti-Israeli activity. The pullbacks in three phases will grant the 
Palestinians partial or total control over 40 percent of the area. 
``We didn't go to Wye River to use the services of (U.S. President 
Bill) Clinton to release car thieves,'' said Ahmed Tibi, a senior 
aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. ``This is not fair and shows 
bad intentions.'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 
response that the peace accord did not stipulate that Israel free 
prisoners with Jewish ``blood on their hands.'' ``There is no way 
that I will free murderers,'' Netanyahu said in a statement. ``I said 
at Wye that I won't free terrorists with blood on their hands, not 
murderers and not Hamas members.''
