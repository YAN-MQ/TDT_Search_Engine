Duane Walker, "CNN Headline Sports." First up is in the NBA, where 
the NBA players and owner representatives met for the first time in 
3 1/2 weeks. The two sides met for over 12 hours Friday. Some progress 
was made as these talks marked the longest in this 143-day lockout. 
I don't want to go into specifics of what was discussed, but you know, 
I can say that I think the atmosphere or the idea of compromise is 
in the atmosphere. We wrestled around a lot, we made progress. We 
probed, explored, talked about the issues. And we've gone just about 
as far as we can go. It's not any one person. I think it was aollective 
effort, and it was actually a good effort.
