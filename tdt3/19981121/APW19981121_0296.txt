Spain's unions Saturday announced they will stage some 50 rallies 
in towns and cities across Spain on Dec. 3 to demand a 35-hour working 
week and greater financial assistance for the unemployed. In a press 
conference, Workers Commission leader Antonio Gutierrez said workers' 
meetings would also be staged at large- and medium-sized business 
and factories so that employers are made aware of the union demands. 
Candido Mendez, leader of Spain's other principal labor group, the 
General Workers Union, said he hoped that after Dec. 3 the conservative 
government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar would show itself to 
be flexible and thus avert more serious action by the unions. Gutierrez 
said that Spain's 1999 state budget would lead to cutbacks in payments 
to the jobless. He warned that Aznar's government also planned cutbacks 
in health and education. Backing a reduction from a 40-hour to a 35-hour 
working week, Gutierrez said that Spain's buoyant economy should ``lead 
to the creation of more jobs and this calls for reorganization and 
a cut in the working day.'' Despite continuous strong economic growth 
and low inflation in recent years, Spain, at nearly 19 percent, still 
has one of the highest unemployment rates in the 15-nation European 
Union.
