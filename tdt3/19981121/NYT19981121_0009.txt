Mayor Rudolph Giuliani warned Friday that the likely loss of the New 
England Patriots by Massachusetts should stand as an object lesson 
for New York City in its dealings with the Yankees and the Mets over 
proposals for new stadiums in the city. ``Take a look at what happened 
in Boston,'' the mayor said, expounding on the issue during his weekly 
radio program on WABC-AM and again during a news conference at City 
Hall. ``That could happen here. Not only could it happen here, it 
has happened here.'' Referring to efforts to keep the Yankees in the 
Bronx, Giuliani said that ``the silly political pandering that's been 
going on by the politicians in this city'' could force the teams out 
of New York. ``You're going to lose the teams the way Boston and Massachusetts 
have now lost the original Boston Patriots, now the New England Patriots 
_ the way my predecessors lost the Brooklyn Dodgers, for which this 
city should be ashamed, and the way they lost the football Giants 
and the Jets,'' he said. The Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team moved 
to Los Angeles in 1958 and the Giants and the Jets of the National 
Football League now share a stadium in the Meadowlands of New Jersey, 
although both clubs still call themselves New York teams. Giuliani 
said a similar fate could easily befall the city over the Yankees 
or Mets. ``It happens because politicians are unwilling to stand up 
to people that are just knee-jerking about this,'' he said. ``They're 
unwilling to, like, take a look at the future and say, yes, it's worth 
spending some public money if we can keep this economic engine in 
our city. If you don't do that, somebody else takes them away from 
you. That's what happened in Boston. And now you have precisely the 
day-after reaction, all the people that were, like, criticizing all 
of these politicians for the possibility of using public money, they're 
going to come down on them, big time.'' Giuliani said that Massachusetts 
lost the Patriots because the speaker of its House of Representatives 
``decided to call the owner of the team a whiny billionaire'' and 
refused to spend money for a new stadium, and because in Boston ``the 
Mayor had a deal with a community group that didn't want the Patriots 
in their little community in Boston, so he wasn't willing to deal 
with that.'' ``If you don't care about the teams, fine, let them go,'' 
Giuliani said. ``Now that's a choice you can make. It's one that I 
think would be a terrible mistake for New York. So I wish people would 
look at the Boston thing and maybe step back and reflect on this.''
