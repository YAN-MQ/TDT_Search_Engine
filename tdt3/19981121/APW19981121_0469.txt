IGLS, Austria (AP) _ the United States doubles luge team of Christian 
Niccum and Matt McClain emerged from the considerable shadow of their 
Olympic medal-winning teammates Saturday by winning the season's opening 
World Cup race. Niccum, of Woodinville, Washington, and McClain of 
Lake Placid, New York, four-time world junior champions, were in a 
dead tie to the thousandth of a second with Nagano bronze medalists 
and defending World Cup overall winners Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin 
after the first of two runs. But a brilliant second heat gave the 
20-year-olds a .072 victory margin. ``All I cared about was seeing 
the U.S. flag fly at the awards ceremony and hearing the anthem,'' 
said McClain. ``We're not really used to that. it was like a silly 
dream.'' The winners posted times of 50.197 and 40.224 seconds for 
a cumulative 1 minute, 20.421 seconds. Grimmettee, of Muskegon, Michigan, 
and Martin of Palo Alto, California, began their defense of the World 
Cup crown with a second-place clocking of 1:20.493. Italians Gerhard 
Plankensteiner and Oswald Haselrieder were third in 1:20.675. Olympic 
silver medal winners Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer finished fourth 
for the third consecutive luge race dating back to 1995 on this former 
Olympic course. Thorpe, of Marquette, Michigan, and Sheer, of Croton, 
New York, recorded a time of 1:20.818. Germany dominated the women's 
event when Sylke Otto, who failed to qualify for the 1998 Olympic 
team, also overcame two Nagano medalists en route to victory, Otto's 
times of 40.100 and 40.288 totaled 1:20.388. Teammate and Olumpic 
silver medalist Barbara Niederhuber placed second in 1:20.884. Austrian 
Angelike Neuner, bronze winner in Nagano, finished third in 1:20.954.
