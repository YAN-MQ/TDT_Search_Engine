The longest-held foreign hostage in Beirut, U.S. journalist Terry 
Anderson, took part in a conference on press freedom in the city Saturday. 
``I'm very happy to be back and I look forward to seeing the progress 
the country has made,'' Anderson told The Associated Press. It was 
Anderson's second visit to Lebanon since his release in 1991 after 
2,455 days in the custody of Muslim extremists. He arrived Friday 
and was expected to stay several days. Anderson said he was representing 
the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based organization 
of which he is the vice president, at a forum organized by the World 
Press Freedoms Committee. Anderson, 50, was chief Middle East correspondent 
for The Associated Press when his kidnappers seized him on March 16, 
1985 at the height of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. His ordeal made 
him the longest-held of 92 foreigners who were abducted during the 
war. Most were freed. Eleven are believed to have been killed by their 
captors or died in captivity. Anderson made his first return to Lebanon 
in 1996 to film a documentary for Cable News Network about the country's 
recovery from the civil war.
