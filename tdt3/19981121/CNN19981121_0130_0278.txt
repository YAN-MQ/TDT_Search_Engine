Independent counsel Ken Starr says reasonable minds can differ, and 
he's standing by his decision to testify before the house Judiciary 
committee. But it has cost him a close adviser. Friday, Sam dash, 
Starr's ethics adviser, resigned in a letter to the independent counsel. 
Dash said his decision to leave had nothing to do with attacks on 
Starr's conduct. In fact, he said Starr and his staff conducted themselves 
with integrity and professionalism, but he, personally, disagreed 
with what he called starr's aggressive role. An independent counsel 
cannot let himself get caught up in a political process, particularly 
as an advocate for the evidence on impeachment. And I believe that's 
a matter of principle, a matter of law, a matter of separation of 
powers, and that I felt strongly enough and let him know that beforehand, 
that if he didn't take that advice, I would resign. We really are, 
as I tried to say yesterday, in uncharted waters. This is the first 
time, unhappily for the country, that under the independent counsel 
law, a referral has been made to Congress. And I think that referral 
was proper, it was lawful. I was obligated to do it under the statute. 
And I lived up to my duty as I saw it.
