Authorities evacuated thousands of fishermen from a remote island 
Saturday as a cyclone with winds up to 115 kph (70 mph) was expected 
to hit the coast early Sunday. The cyclone could whip up high tidal 
waves and inundate low-lying areas along stretches of the country's 
400-kilometer (250-mile) coastline, the meteorological department 
said. The cyclone, spawning from a depression in the Bay of Bengal 
on Thursday, intensified into a ``sever cyclone'' on Saturday. Moving 
southwest with a speed of 20 kph (12 mph), it was located 500 kilometers 
(310 miles) south and southwest of Khulna district. More than 5,000 
fishermen on Dublarchar island in the Bay of Bengal have moved to 
safe areas, Wahud Ahmed, a Bangladesh Red Crescent official, said 
in Dhaka. Dublarchar is 135 kilometers (85 miles) southwest of Dhaka, 
the Bangladesh capital. The Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of 
the Red Cross, has posted nearly 33,000 volunteers along the coast 
where at least 10 million people live. The region has more than 1,200 
shelters for the residents. ``Using loud speakers, our volunteers 
are alerting people to move to shelters at short notice,'' Ahmed said. 
Even though the core of the cyclone headed southwest, officials at 
Chittagong, the southeastern port city, were taking no chances. Authorities 
at the country's largest Chittagong Port have advised 19 anchored 
ships to take precautions. State-run radio and television were broadcasting 
cyclone warnings. Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation, is buffeted 
by tropical cyclones that kill hundreds of people every year. A menacing 
cyclone killed 138,000 people along the coast in 1991.
