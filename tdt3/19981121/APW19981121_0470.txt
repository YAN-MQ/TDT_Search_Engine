The Cypriot president rejected Saturday the resignation of his interior 
minister, who has been accused of corruption by a parliamentary committee. 
President Glafcos Clerides announced his decision in a statement issued 
after a five-hour Cabinet meeting called to discuss the attorney-general's 
report into the accusations against the minister, Dinos Michaelides. 
The statement said the attorney general had found 11 corruption charges 
against Michaelides to be baseless. The accusations stemmed from the 
chairman of the parliamentary Watchdog Committee. But the Cabinet 
accepted the attorney-general's recommendation that the police investigate 
two other allegations against the minister, whose department issues 
building permits and residence visas. The two allegations say Michaelides 
benefited personally from alterations in town planning zones and from 
the irregular granting of residence permits to aliens. Clerides said 
he would not accept Michaelides' resignation because an investigation 
itself ``does not constitute guilt, and no person is considered guilty 
because there are charges against him.'' Earlier Michaelides had walked 
out of the Cabinet meeting, telling reporters he had submitted his 
resignation because of the attorney-general's recommendation that 
two charges be pursued. Later Michaelides was summoned to the Presidential 
Palace to be told that his resignation had been rejected. On leaving, 
Michaelides told journalists he was fully satisfied with the development 
and had withdrawn his resignation. Opposition parties have criticized 
Clerides for not insisting that Michaelides step down while the investigation 
is conducted. During the presidential elections in February, Michaelides 
broke ranks with his party to endorse Clerides.
