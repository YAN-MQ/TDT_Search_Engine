Top government officials tried and failed Saturday to come to terms 
on a 1999 budget that is intended to set the country on the road out 
of economic crisis. ``More work is needed,'' Economics Minister Andrei 
Shapovalyants said after a four-hour meeting of key government ministers. 
The ministers considered three alternative plans, but ultimately rejected 
them all and called for more revisions, including changes on external 
debt servicing and tax reform. After the meeting, Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov met with a delegation of International Monetary Fund officials 
to discuss the country's economic situation, the Interfax news agency 
said. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov had said earlier 
that Russia would ask the IMF for new terms on repaying the dlrs 4.6 
billion due to the lending organization next year. New IMF loans to 
Russia have been on hold since August. The IMF has insisted it will 
not release any more money until the government comes up with a comprehensive 
plan to combat the economic crisis and starts implementing it. But 
government officials said they might not be able to adopt a budget 
until they determine whether foreign creditors can be persuaded to 
restructure at least a portion of dlrs 17 billion in debt payments 
due in 1999. ``Only when we know how much we will have to pay on our 
external debts will we be able to set our fiscal policy,'' Shapovalyants 
said. The government hopes to complete drafting its 1999 budget by 
Dec. 1, but it will require more details on the planned tax reform 
for next year, Shapovalyants said. ``We have to finalize volumes of 
(expected) tax collections and set new tax brackets,'' he said. The 
three versions put the disparity between revenues and spending at 
either 150 billion rubles (dlrs 9 billion), 280 billion rubles (dlrs 
16 billion), or 360 billion rubles (dlrs 21 billion), according to 
one senior government official, who spoke Friday on the condition 
of anonymity. Shapovalyants was quoted Saturday as saying the government 
intended to use the most optimistic scenario, which also projects 
a 3 percent drop in productivity and an inflation rate of 30 percent.
