Now to the Korean peninsula. The president's visit there has highlighted 
an area of great tension. The south is accusing the north of looking 
for trouble. NBC's Bob Kur is traveling with the president. What President 
Clinton called "deep concern" about recent actions by north Korea 
dominated his talks with south Korea's President Kim Dae jung. First, 
stepped-up missile production and a new threat. NBC news has learned 
that soon, the CIA expects north Korea to test a Missile capable of 
reaching Alaska and the Hawaiian islands, a missile the U.S. suspects 
north Korea will sell to Iran, Iraq and Pakistan. Second, what could 
be a new underground nuclear facility and north Korea's refusal this 
week to allow inspectors to see whether it violates an agreement north 
Korea made with the U.S. barring construction of such facilities. 
No one yet knows for sure, at least in our camp, what the facility 
is and what its purpose is. But it raises a strong suspicion. We will 
not tolerate an possible attempt of north Korea to proliferate nuclear 
weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction. a tense De-militarized 
zone still separates the two Koreas where a cease-fire ended a war 
45 years ago. The north still considers the U.S. an enemy and 37,000 
American troops remain on duty in the area. Earlier this year, a submarine 
from the north was captured in southern waters, and other attempts 
at infiltration are suspected. Recently, a new policy of engagement 
between the Koreas led to shiploads of south Koreans getting a rare 
chance to visit the north. Today, the president warned that further 
progress on engagement is in jeopardy. I hope that the north Koreans 
will not do anything to force us to change policy. Mr. Clinton has 
asked former defense secretary William Perry to review and coordinate 
policy on north Korea a job Perry is set to begin on monday. On Sunday, 
Mr. Clinton plans to visit a training center to inspect weapons near 
the De-militarized zone. He'll also stop at an air base which houses 
the spy planes that keep an eye on north Korea. Bob Kur, NBC news, 
with the president in Seoul.
