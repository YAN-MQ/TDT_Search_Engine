Standing in lines that snake through government offices, South Africans 
are fighting red tape for the right to vote next year. At the main 
office here, several have lost the battle with bureaucracy and have 
been sent home because they lacked the proper documents or the correct 
number of photos. The government's plan is to create the first national 
voters roll by registering 25 million people in three days, beginning 
Friday. To register, people must use bar-coded identification books 
introduced in 1986 to gradually replace the older versions. But millions 
of voters lack the documents. Given the long lines and confusion about 
the process, it is unlikely that many of them will have the proper 
identification, or a special receipt saying they applied for one in 
time. The problems with bar-coded identification books could have 
political consequences. Fewer whites, the bulwark support of opposition 
parties, have the proper documents than blacks, which could mean a 
boon for the governing African National Congress. During 1994's all-race 
elections, which ended apartheid, voters only needed to show up on 
election day with any identification and at any polling place. Registration 
was scrapped to reduce tension before the historic vote. Requiring 
the bar-coded identification to register was the brainchild of the 
Independent Electoral Commission, which since has tried to reverse 
the plan after learning about the backlogs. But the ANC government 
believes the backlogs are not that bad and has stuck by the idea, 
inviting criticism that it wants to exclude white voters. More than 
80 percent of blacks have the bar-coded documents, compared with 65 
percent of whites. It was more in the interest of blacks to obtain 
them. As apartheid was ending, many rushed to obtain the bar-coded 
identification to replace their apartheid-era documents. Now, record 
numbers of people are lining up for new identification documents, 
up 60 percent over last year, said Home Affairs spokesman Manafe Makewla. 
That doesn't mean they get them. A dejected Edwin Rasekwere, 40, who 
is black, was told at the Home Affairs window he needed a birth certificate 
from a magistrate's court. ``Maybe I'm going to spend the whole day 
there,'' he said. Gary Gilmore, 46, a white South African, was turned 
away because he didn't have enough photographs. ``So now I have to 
decide if I want to come back into this'' line, he said. ``And that 
will depend on my workload next week.''
