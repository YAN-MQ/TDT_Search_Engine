Austrian police have taken all precautions for the protection of U.S. 
facilities in Austria after a reported terrorist warning, a police 
official said Saturday. The U.S. State Department said Friday that 
the U.S. Embassy in Vienna had received credible information concerning 
the possibility of a terrorist act in the near future against American-affiliated 
facilities in Austria. It noted that a worldwide statement issued 
last week urged Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance. However, 
the police official who did not give his name said that Austrian police 
had ``no concrete indications'' of anti-U.S. plans in Austria. Nevertheless, 
the street on which the U.S. Embassy is located, has been permanently 
closed to traffic since Nov. 19, the official confirmed. He did not 
elaborate on other security measures taken except to refer to ``heightened 
surveillance'' of the embassy area.
