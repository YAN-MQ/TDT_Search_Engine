When Tina Barrett was an LPGA rookie in 1989, she won a tournament, 
and she took winning for granted. ``I was very, very green,'' said 
Barrett, now a 32-year-old tour veteran. ``I thought when you played 
well, you won. That was really the only week I played well. I won, 
so I thought that's how that worked. I've since learned that it doesn't 
always happen like that.'' Did she ever learn. Barrett has not won 
on the LPGA tour since that victory, a nine-year drought that has 
been both character-building and frustrating. Barrett's long quest 
for victory, however, could be fulfilled this weekend at the Pagenet 
Tour Championship, the season-ending event that is limited to the 
year's top 30 money-winners and is one of the four major tournaments 
in women's golf. Barrett entered play Saturday in second place (seven 
under par) at the Desert Inn Golf Club, four strokes behind Laura 
Davies, the leader at 11 under par (133). Karrie Webb, at five under, 
was in third place. For Barrett, winning a prestigious tournament 
after such a long wait would make the accomplishment even more gratifying. 
``I kind of feel like I'm due,'' said Barrett, who came close two 
weeks ago when she lost on the third hole of a sudden-death playoff 
to Hiromi Kobayashi in the Japan Classic. ``I am so much better than 
I was in 1989. I have experience, I hit the ball better, I'm a better 
putter, I'm a better chipper. But I know how hard it is to win. ``It 
was nice to be naive,'' she added. ``But I've had situations where 
I've played well and not won. I've had situations where I've kind 
of choked. I've had other situations where someone just played better. 
I just have to keep plugging along.'' At least by finishing among 
the top 30 money winners each year since 1996, Barrett has put herself 
into position to win the championship for three straight years. Not 
a long hitter at 5 feet 4 1/2 inches, Barrett relies on her accuracy 
and putting. Davies is the LPGA's longest hitter, capable of drives 
in the 300-yard range. Barrett knew that on many holes, Davies would 
outdrive her by 50 yards or more. ``I've said I'm going to be reincarnated 
as a long hitter,'' Barrett said. ``But you can't do anything about 
it. I have to play the way I play.'' If Barrett were to win this weekend, 
ending her long drought might give her the confidence to reach even 
greater heights. On Thursday, Davies lamented her 24th-place standing 
on the money list, saying she was used to being ranked higher. Barrett 
would like to have that kind of assurance herself. ``I aspire to be 
at that level,'' she said. ``But 20th on the money list is a good 
year. There's an A level and an A-plus level, and Laura really is 
in the A-plus category. I haven't been there yet. I don't have the 
length, but then you have someone like Rosie Jones, who has made a 
whole bunch of Solheim Cup teams, and she hits it like I do. But it 
seems like the top of our tour has a little bit better ball strikers, 
and they hit it just a little bit farther.'' Davies used her power 
to build her lead at the halfway point, shooting 11 under par (three 
eagles, five birdies) on the par-5 holes. ``The long hitters will 
tell you that our courses are too short,'' Barrett said on Friday. 
``I could see it today. Karrie was hitting wedges into some holes 
when I was hitting 6-irons. I don't complain when the courses are 
too long, but a lot of the long hitters complain when the courses 
are too short. A lot of them might think this course is too short. 
I don't think it is. But it seems like on the men's tour, the par 
5's are reachable in two shots by 85 percent of the players, while 
here it might be 50 percent.'' Barrett, though, did not care how far 
Davies might hit the ball this weekend, as long as Barrett wins the 
first-place check of $215,000. ``I've improved my season tremendously 
in the last few weeks,'' she said. ``Before that, I was 40th on the 
money list and playing OK. But I've made a mediocre season a lot better.''
