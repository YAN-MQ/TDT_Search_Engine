President Clinton and south Korean President Kim Dae-Jung are calling 
on north Korea to give the U.S. full access to suspected nuclear sites. 
Mr. Clinton is in Seoul as part of a two-day visit to south Korea. 
During a state dinner, Kim said despite the tension, both countries 
on the korean peninsula are increasing cooperation. But President 
Clinton warns that could be in jeopardy. John king reports. The two 
leaders joined hands to warn north Korea that the standoff over a 
suspected nuclear site puts a recent thawing of relations at risk. 
Could missile launches without notification, the construction of suspect 
facilities, other provocations, undermine the policy we are pursuing? 
Of course it could. This week's historic vacation cruise to the north 
is a reflection of south Korean President Kim Dae-Jung's risky policy 
of limited engagement with his communist neighbor. But nervous isolation 
is the far more familiar picture of the Korean peninsula, and these 
two allies say it will change only if the north cooperates and allows 
access to the suspicious underground site at kumchangli. Given our 
defense partnership here, nothing could ever be put in that hole in 
the ground that would give the north Koreans as much advantage, as 
much power, as much wealth, as much happiness as more of those ships 
going up there full of people from here. Sources tell CNN the two 
leaders also discussed U.S. intelligence on north Korea's plans for 
new missile tests -- and its export of missile technology to Iran, 
Pakistan and others. President Kim condemned the north's military 
programs but also made clear he favors diplomacy over confrontation. 
If the north responds in a cooperative fashion to our requirements 
in these regards, then of course we can respond with positive incentives, 
favorable responses. But Mr. Clinton warns the north needs to show 
good faith soon or lose U.S. funding for the 1994 agreement in which 
north Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear program in return for outside 
help with its energy needs, including two light-water nuclear reactors. 
Security concerns dominated the day, but the two leaders also took 
time to discuss the Asian economic crisis. Mr. Clinton held out south 
Korea as a model to Japan and others the United States wishes would 
act more quickly and boldly to adopt economic reforms. John king,
