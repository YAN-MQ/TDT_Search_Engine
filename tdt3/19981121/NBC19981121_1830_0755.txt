To a major health concern now in this country -- arthritis, endured 
by one in six Americans. Tonight, the government is calling for a 
new and comprehensive public health approach to fighting it. NBC's 
Stan Bernard has our report. Let me check the joints in the fingers. 
Judy Rosen is a 44-year-old mother of two and has had lupus since 
she was 14. Lupus is one of a hundred or more arthritis-related conditions 
crippling nearly 43 million Americans. There is now hope for more 
effective treatment. These are exciting times, because research is 
quickly moving from the bench to the bedside. Today in Atlanta, the 
center for disease control and the arthritis foundation, launched 
a campaign to inform Americans how the work in the laboratory can 
help them to prevent and to decrease the painful and costly impact 
of arthritis and related diseases. The approach to treatment is undergoing 
a fundamental change. Arthritis is not something where we thought 
of prevention, but now we have the ability with medicines, with early 
treatment, and even with other approaches to prevent arthritis and 
its complications. Under the new approach patients should ask themselves 
if their pain is chronic. Exercise is also part of the prevention 
program. The campaign is filled with hope not to conjure up some fountain 
of youth but to more effectively treat all who suffer from arthritis 
pain and to lessen the impact on the aging baby boomer generation.
