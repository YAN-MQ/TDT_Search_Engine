Egypt's foreign minister Saturday described as ``a positive step'' 
Israel's withdrawal from parts of the West Bank and said he hoped 
the Jewish state would implement the rest of the Wye River Accord. 
Amr Moussa was speaking to reporters on his arrival in Muscat, capital 
of the Gulf sultanate of Oman, to deliver a letter from Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak to Sultan Qaboos, the Omani ruler. The official Omani 
News Agency, which reported Moussa's arrival and remarks, did not 
say what the letter was about. During his one-day visit, Moussa will 
discuss regional developments and bilateral ties with Sultan Qaboos 
and Foreign Minister Youssef bin Alawi, he said. The Wye River accord, 
signed in Washington on Oct. 23, stipulates an Israeli withdrawal 
from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security 
guarantees. Israel withdrew from parts of the West Bank Friday, giving 
the Palestinians control over an additional 2 percent of the territory 
and upgrading their authority in 7 percent of the land. Under the 
agreement, Israel is to carry out two more pullbacks by late January, 
awarding Palestinians joint or sole jurisdiction over 40 percent of 
the West Bank. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 
Middle east war.
