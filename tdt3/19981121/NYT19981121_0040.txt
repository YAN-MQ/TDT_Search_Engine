This is the difficult position the New York Jets find themselves in, 
and they are not alone: they are in a stretch run, and yet for the 
race to remain on a level course, they need a victory here against 
the Tennessee Oilers. So the Jets are focusing on Sunday, but some 
part of them is thinking ahead. They are 6-4, the Oilers are 6-4. 
In fact, it seems that most teams in the American Conference are close 
to that record with six games remaining. ``My mama said take one day 
at a time,'' said defensive lineman Bobby Hamilton. But the Jets' 
surrogate father, Bill Parcells, went out of his way last week to 
look ahead and explain to the players the significance of this game 
in the context of the season. ``Here's the bottom line,'' he told 
them. ``There are six games to go. No team's schedule is any more 
favorable than ours.'' The Jets' final six games come against teams 
with a combined won-lost record of 30-30. The Dolphins, 7-3, and in 
first place, will face teams with a 41-19 record. The Bills, tied 
with the Jets at 6-4, will meet teams with a combined mark of 27-33. 
The 5-5 Patriots will battle teams with a 35-25 mark. First up for 
the Jets are the Oilers, whose Eddie George is averaging more than 
120 yards rushing a game since October, and whose defense held the 
Steelers' Jerome Bettis to a total of 55 yards in two games. Thus, 
the Oilers show strength in the two categories that every club depends 
on to win in the NFL: running, and stopping the run. The Jets counter 
with Curtis Martin, who will be trying to churn it out on the ground 
after coming off a 100-yard effort at Indianapolis, his fifth of the 
season. The Jets' defense has also has had impressive games, halting 
Marshall Faulk, Karim Abdul-Jabbar and Jamal Anderson. This time it 
will be attempting to stop George. And what about the rest of the 
game plan? The week before the season opened, Parcells noted what 
he thought were unsettled areas. How well the Jets have addressed 
these areas will be pivotal against the Oilers: _New punter Nick Gallery 
holding for place-kicker John Hall. Last year it was the experienced 
Brian Hansen. Result: Neither Gallery nor Hansen lasted, and now John 
Kidd will be punting to one of the league's poorer return units. It 
averages only 6.9 yards. _Establishing a perimeter passing game; that 
is, getting the wide receivers into the action. Result: Keyshawn Johnson, 
Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward form one of the most dangerous threesomes 
in the NFL. Chrebet and Johnson have 15-yard averages. _Getting Glenn 
Foley ready for his first season as a starter. Result: Foley is now 
on the bench, and Vinny Testaverde has proved to be one of the most 
effective quarterbacks of the season. In the Oilers, he meets a defense 
that allows 63 percent of opponents' passes to be completed. That 
unit has failed to distress quarterbacks by producing only eight interceptions 
and the fewest sacks in the league. _Open-field tackling by defense; 
halting big plays. Result: Tackling could continue to plague the Jets. 
The misses against the Colts were crucial in the 1-point loss last 
Sunday. _Production from tight ends Kyle Brady and Fred Baxter. Result: 
Brady's best season includes four touchdowns. With their committed 
running game, the Oilers have a better possession time than the Jets 
(by one second) and have also been able to halt third-down plays almost 
two-thirds of the time in the last month. Of course, much of that 
has to do with getting early big leads. There is an outside chance 
that Sunday's game could ultimately decide a wild-card berth between 
the clubs. Their head-to-head result would only matter if they had 
the same record. The Jets, however, will try to wrest the division 
title outright (something they have never done since the American 
Football League and National Football League merger of 1970). ``We've 
got four teams in our division in contention,'' said Parcells, ``and 
maybe nine or 10 for playoff spots. I told the players, `Did you think 
it was going to be easy? Five of our six games left are with playoff 
contenders.''' Parcells also said, ``I'm not bringing in the big picture 
yet, other than to mention Denver and Jacksonville as clubs that seem 
to be above everyone else.'' ``The big picture,'' said center Kevin 
Mawae, ``has a lot of little parts to it. Of course I know the standings 
and the schedule, but you learn never to look beyond this week. If 
you're looking beyond it, it's too far.'' Hamilton, still listening 
to his mother, admitted, ``At this point, you have to think about 
the rest of the schedule, but you have no control.'' He said that 
since his high school days, he has never looked at a schedule once 
the season began. ``I know we're playing the Oilers now,'' he says. 
``Who's after that? Carolina?''
