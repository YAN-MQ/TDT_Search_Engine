Dogged by intensely-publicized sleaze charges, the Interior Minister 
of Cyprus said Saturday that he had submitted his resignation to President 
Glafcos Clerides. Dinos Michaelides said his action followed a recommendation 
by the attorney-general that a criminal investigation be launched 
into allegations of corruption leveled against him. He made the announcement 
as he left an extraordinary Cabinet meeting. The cabinet began to 
debate whether to accept the attorney general's recommendation after 
Michaelides left. The minister has repeatedly denied the allegations, 
first made by the head of Parliament's Watchdog Committee in a detailed 
report listing more than 30 cases of corruption and improper action 
resulting in the minister's enrichment.
