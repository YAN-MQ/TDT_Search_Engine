A new Justice Department study challenges conventional wisdom about 
gangs, saying that those who join gangs for protection from neighborhood 
violence often suffer serious brutality in the assaults that are part 
of their initiation rites. ``Many youths are under the mistaken impression 
that they will be safer by joining a gang, while this report shows 
the exact opposite,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement. 
``Our challenge is to educate young people so they realize that staying 
away from gangs is the safest course.'' The study also found that 
gang members were more likely to commit crimes involving drugs, auto 
theft and shootings than their non-gang peers. Gang members are also 
more likely to possess weapons. ``Kids who join gangs for status or 
protection usually end up getting in more trouble,'' said Irving Spergel, 
a professor at the University of Chicago and head of the Gang Research 
and Technical Assistance Group. ``Kids who manage to avoid gangs have 
found their self-esteem elsewhere.'' The report, sponsored by two 
Justice Department offices, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention and the National Institute of Justice, examines criminal 
behavior of gang members and of those susceptible to gang membership 
in Denver and Aurora, Colo., and in Broward County, Fla. Those communities 
were chosen for their diverse populations and emerging gang problems. 
Researchers discovered a pattern of gang involvement. The median age 
at which youths began hanging out with gangs was 13; they tended to 
join gangs at 14 and experienced their first arrest within a year. 
``The single best predictor of kids avoiding or getting out of gangs 
is finding legitimate employment,'' Spergel said. The report's author, 
C. Ronald Huff, said the study underscored the need for effective 
programs to help youths resist gang membership.
