Asia's economic collapse will depress oil and gasoline prices for 
nearly a decade, saving motorists in the United States about 13 cents 
a gallon in 2000 alone, the Energy Department said last week. While 
the Asian crisis has already helped to lower energy costs, the report 
offers by far the strongest evidence that the effects will be deep 
and long-lasting. In the United States, continued low energy prices 
are likely to limit inflation, economists say. Weak Asian demand and 
heavy global production also reduce the nation's vulnerability to 
any sudden disruption of oil imports, which account for about half 
of U.S. demand. But the low oil and gasoline prices also hamper the 
fight against global warming. With oil at $13 or $15 a barrel, there 
are few economic incentives for saving energy or using renewable energy 
sources to reduce pollution that is blamed for global warming. The 
oil glut has also resulted from falling production costs and the opening 
of new regions. The Energy Department expects higher production from 
the Caspian Sea, the North Sea and the waters off West Africa, as 
well as from Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. While some oil companies 
are trimming their investments, many are too far along on projects 
to turn back, said Jay Hakes, chief of the department's Energy Information 
Administration, which issued the report. ``You can't just turn the 
spigot off on a well that's already producing,'' he said. The 13-cent-a-gallon 
savings in the year 2000 are from the prices forecast if there had 
been no Asian crisis. Analysts at the Energy Department and the oil 
companies doubt that oil prices will necessarily remain at the present 
levels of less than $13 a barrel. The partial resumption of Iraqi 
output, to pay for food, has recently forced prices down, leaving 
unleaded regular gasoline at less than $1 a gallon throughout much 
of the nation. The Energy Department, relying on economic forecasts 
by DRI/McGraw Hill, sees Asia recovering so slowly that the average 
oil price in the year 2000, adjusted for inflation, will still be 
less than $14 a barrel. That price is about $5.50 a barrel less than 
the $19.50 the department predicted last year, before the scale of 
Asia's problems became evident. ``Last year we were sort of seeing 
this like Mexico,'' said Hakes, referring to that country's crisis 
four years ago. ``Where there were economic problems, they bounced 
back pretty quickly. This year we are seeing it as more sustained.'' 
He cautions that it is unclear how quickly Asia will recapture foreign 
investment. But even if energy demand there soars once again, he says, 
global production can keep up. Not until about 2007 does his agency 
see oil prices returning to about where they would have been apart 
from Asia's woes. Joseph Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy 
Research Associates, agreed that Asia's situation had reshaped the 
oil market. ``The upward moving balloon of demand has been pierced 
by the Asian crisis,'' he said. Oil companies, already trying to cut 
their staffs and economize, have been pessimistic about prices for 
the next few years. Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell, 
the world's largest oil company, recently predicted prices of $12 
to $16 a barrel over the next two to three years. While oil producers 
like Mexico and Russia might suffer, low oil prices are a boon for 
the United States, reducing not only inflation but also the trade 
deficit. Continued low prices and rising consumption of fossil fuels, 
including coal, will raise carbon emissions in about the year 2010 
by 33 percent over the 1990 level, the agency predicts. To comply 
with the Kyoto agreement to slow global warming, the United States 
has pledged to reduce emissions over this period by 10 percent from 
the 1990 level. Foes of the accord, which the administration signed 
earlier this month but has not submitted to the Senate, have already 
cited the agency's forecasts as evidence that compliance would be 
prohibitively expensive. Administration officials say that the United 
States, by paying other countries to reduce emissions and encouraging 
technological progress, can reduce emissions much more cheaply than 
the agency expects.
