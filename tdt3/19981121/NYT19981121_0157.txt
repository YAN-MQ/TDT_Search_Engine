The closing of the Concord Resort Hotel leaves only a handful of the 
famous Catskills resorts. Earlier this year, the acknowledged queen 
of the hotels, Grossinger's, closed after steadily declining for years, 
said John Conway, an expert on Sullivan County history. So did the 
Pines, which was in South Fallsburg and, like many of the hotels, 
became prominent in the 1930s. Other names from the past have been 
closed for much longer. The Flagler closed in the early 1970s and 
is now the Crystal Run School for developmentally disabled children. 
Four hotels _ the Brickman, the Windsor, the Gilberts and the Nemerson 
_ have also been closed since the early 1970s and are now part of 
a collection of private religious centers operated by the followers 
of an Indian guru, Conway said. The Stevensville closed in the early 
1980s, Conway said. But its new owners plan to reopen it in early 
1999 as the Swan Lake Golf and Tennis Resort Center, said Jonathan 
Drapkin, the Sullivan County manager. It will join Kutsher's _ whose 
patriarch, Milton Kutsher, died last week _ and the Raleigh as the 
only vestiges of the region's storied past.
