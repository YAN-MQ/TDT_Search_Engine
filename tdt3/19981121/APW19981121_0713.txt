Emma Carrick-Anderson gave Britain's skiing a boost Saturday, finishing 
14th in the opening run a women's World Cup slalom and for the first 
time in her career cracking the top 30 to qualify for a second run. 
``I'm so excited. I can't hardly believe it,'' the red-haired, freckle-faced 
Scotswoman said. ``It felt quite good. I've been skiing well in training 
and this didn't feel any different. ``I had a second run in the world 
champs two years ago but never in World Cup so it's real exciting.'' 
Even though she came up empty after falling in the afternoon run, 
just getting to ski for World Cup points was an immediate payback 
for the career change Carrick-Anderson made after last season. Following 
two seasons on her own with a coach, she was allowed to join the Finnish 
team for training. ``It's so brilliant to have other people to compare 
with _ and to laugh with, and everything else, too,'' she said. ``I 
just need other people around me. ``I could do timing (in 1997 and 
1998) but I had nobody to push me, whereas the girls this year are 
very good and I've had to go every run.'' Bouyed by her Finnish training 
regimen, Carrick-Anderson took a large leap forward from a 60th starting 
position. ``This year, I decided I'd had enough starts in the back,'' 
she said. ``I'd just had enough of that.'' And yet, making it into 
the top 15 for the second run didn't seem all that difficult after 
she'd done it. ``At the start today, I was really relaxed, unlike 
last year when I was really tense and felt I had to do it. This year, 
I didn't feel I had to do it. I love the skiing and if I do it, that's 
great. I'm surprised. My run felt good but it didn't feel anything 
special and I always thought to get into the top 30 you had to do 
something really special.''
