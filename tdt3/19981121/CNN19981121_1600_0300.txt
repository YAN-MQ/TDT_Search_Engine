Independent counsel Ken Starr is again defending his investigation 
of President Clinton. He's come under renewed scrutiny following the 
departure of longtime ethical adviser Sam dash. Dash was upset with 
Starr's testimony before the house Judiciary committee, saying Starr 
wrongly became an "aggressive advocate" for impeachment. Starr maintains 
the disagreement with dash is very limited. His bottom line, not withstanding 
this narrow area of disagreement over the role that everyone has now 
seen, I mean this is all out there in the public eye, and the public 
of course can judge for itself, and determine what the law should 
provide for in terms of the role of the independent council, but what 
he has concluded throughout our investigation, is that we've conducted 
ourselves properly and ethically and professionally. Even if the house 
Judiciary committee approves articles of impeachment, don't expect 
it to easily pass Congress. Two republican house members -- Peter 
king of New York and John Edward porter of Illinois -- say dozens 
of their colleagues would oppose president clinton's removal from 
office.
