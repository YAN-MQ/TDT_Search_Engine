Angered by recent brutal murders of taxi drivers, hundreds of cabs 
drove through Poland's cities Saturday to demand restoration of the 
death penalty. ``The death penalty deters criminals,'' said Kazimierz 
Dobrowolski, 60, a driver from the Plus taxi company, which organized 
a protest in Warsaw. In line with laws in western Europe, Poland's 
new penal code, introduced in September, abolished capital punishment, 
making life imprisonment the country's toughest sentence. A defendant 
can apply for a conditional release after 25 years. ``I don't know 
if a criminal will really spend his lifetime in jail. And if he is 
released after 25 years, he will be even more depraved,'' said Dobrowolski. 
He does not drive his cab in the evenings because he fears an attack. 
Some 1,000 cabs took part in the protest in the central city of Lodz 
where two cab drivers and a parking attendant were shot last month, 
PAP news agency reported. During the protest, the drivers gathered 
signatures to petition for reintroduction of the death penalty that 
is to be given to parliament on December 2. Under Poland's constitution, 
a group of 100,000 citizens can submit a motion to parliament. The 
drivers are also demanding more police patrols and setting up a hotline 
with police.
