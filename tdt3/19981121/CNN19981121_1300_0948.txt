A rise in sales in October has retailers hopeful about the holidays. 
But for that momentum to continue, they need to have plenty of sales 
people. Susan Lisovicz reports that may be a problem. The shelves 
are full at this Kay-bee toy store. The staffing situation is anything 
but. We're pretty rough on it, because we have a lot of minors coming 
in, and they really do want to work. But there's no older people who

limited is increasing its employee discounts. Sears offers referral 
bonuses and recruits from welfare-to-work applicants. Macy's needs 
up to an additional 12,000 seasonal workers. This year we've also 
introduced a sign-on bonus, where depending on the region -- for example, 
our New England region, hiring has been very difficult, and we're 
offering a $300 sign-on bonus in that region, as well as the New York 
metropolitan area and our New Jersey stores. Susan Lisovicz, "CNN 
Financial News," New York.
