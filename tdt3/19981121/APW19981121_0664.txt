TURICEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) - The charred remains of what was once 
a village pokes through the blanket of snow into the slate gray sky, 
a white desert seemingly empty of life in the silent Kosovo countryside. 
Then a movement. A man in a blue jacket moves slowly up the hill toward 
an almost indiscernable wisp of smoke curling from a makeshift chimney. 
A second movement catches the eye. A boy this time. On closer observation, 
there are people in this devastated countryside, now covered with 
the first snowfall of the winter. They do live here. In a way. An 
awful way. A cold, hungry way. Jakup Syla greets a visitor. He is 
able to smile even as he indicates his wrecked, roofless, windowless 
home, burned to the brick frame. He and his family have made a home 
in the basement since coming back a month ago. The room is cold and 
damp. Stalactites of seepage drip from the ceiling as Syla's wife 
flattens the dough for bread. Outside, a few chickens scratch and 
a mangy yellow dog looks for warmth. The Serbs devastated this ethnic 
Albanian village 50 kilometers (30) miles west of Pristina during 
their final offensive in September. ``You want to see a house with 
30 people living on one room?'' asks a neighbor who has come to see 
what all the excitement is about in Syla's house. A short walk next 
door. A tractor with three wheels leans against the wall of an unfinished 
home. In fact, 32 people from seven families live in one room of Avdi 
Syla's house. Twenty-six of them have come here from other villages 
to seek shelter with family and friends. ``We are going to spend the 
winter together here,'' says Avdi Syla, a 66-year-old grandfather 
in a worn jacket and dirty white conical Albanian hat. The longer 
the visitor stays, the more people turn up. Villagers estimate about 
30 percent of the original 200 families have returned in the past 
month, though most of the houses are uninhabitable. ``We don't have 
anything,'' says Avdi Syla. ``If somebody helps us, good. Otherwise 
we will try to survive somehow.'' These families have not received 
any humanitarian aid at all, they say, and are living mostly on potatoes. 
Diplomatic observers came here once, villagers said. They said they 
would come back with aid. But they never did. ``You have to take notes,'' 
Syla told a reporter. ``Tell the world what is happening to us.''
