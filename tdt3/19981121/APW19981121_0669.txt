Lindsay Davenport got her revenge, beating Steffi Graf 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 
on Saturday to advance to the title match of the dlrs 2 million Chase 
Championships. The victory comes six days after Graf upset Davenport, 
the top-ranked player, in the final of a tournament in Philadelphia. 
Davenport ended Graf's match winning streak at 12, handing the German 
her first loss since having wrist surgery in September. Graf was seeking 
her third consecutive tournament title since rejoining the WTA Tour. 
In Sunday's championship match, Davenport will face the winner of 
Saturday's second semifinal between No. 2 Martina Hingis of Switzerland 
and Irina Spirlea of Romania. Hingis is seeking her second trip to 
the final in her three trips to New York City's Madison Square Garden. 
In her debut in 1996, she lost in five sets to Graf. Sunday's title 
match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time women play more than 
three sets. The winner will collect dlrs 500,000, with dlrs 250,000 
going to the losing finalist. Davenport is top-seeded in this season-ending, 
16-player tournament. Graf, a five-time winner of the Championships, 
was unseeded in the Madison Square Garden event for the first time 
in 13 appearances, having never been ranked lower than No. 3. Their 
semifinal was a battle of wills as much as forehands, and Davenport 
proved just as tough in both. She played mostly to Graf's backhand, 
daring her opponent to come up with a winning solution. Graf was the 
crowd favorite until nearly the last game of the match. It made no 
difference to the U.S. Open champion, who finally won them over with 
her gutsy play and big strokes. Whenever Graf seemed to gain the upper 
hand, Davenport came back with yet another winner. She finally got 
the crowd cheering for her on the second point of the final game when, 
after making several off-balance shots to stay in the point, she won 
with a sharply angled crosscourt forehand. That made it 15-all, and 
Graf won only one more point in the match. Davenport advanced to the 
semifinals Friday night by easily defeating eighth-seeded Nathalie 
Tauziat of France 6-0, 6-3. Hingis clinched a berth with a 7-6 (7-4), 
6-4 victory over No. 6 Mary Pierce of France.
