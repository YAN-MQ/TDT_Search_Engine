39 first-time members of Congress took part in a lottery this morning 
to determine which offices they'll occupy on Capitol Hill. Not all 
the offices are alike, so there was a lot riding on it. Republican 
congressman Tom Reynolds of New York drew the number one pick. Another 
New York republican, John Sweeney, got the last one. The members then 
toured the available offices and made their choices.
