The seven rounds of nuclear talks between India and the United States 
have not much to show in terms of results, United News of India quoted 
the Indian defense minister as saying on Saturday. ``The talks have 
shown that the United States has an agenda for India which is not 
acceptable,'' said George Fernandes in his speech on ``Defense strategy, 
then and now,'' in New Delhi. He did not give details. ``The United 
States should understand India's security concerns and reconcile itself 
to the obvious. India is too big and potentially a very powerful country 
to be subjected to a carrot and stick treatment,'' UNI quoted the 
defense minister as saying. India has fought three wars against Pakistan 
and one against China during the past 50 years over territorial disputes, 
and its two neighbours are nuclear weapon states. Fernandes spoke 
about the lack of progress in the Indo-U.S. dialogue a day after U.S. 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Indian negotiator Jaswant 
Singh ended their latest round of talks in Rome aimed at nudging New 
Delhi to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The talks began after 
India tested five nuclear devices in May, provoking rival tests by 
Pakistan. A joint statement Friday acknowledged that differences remained 
and Talbott and Singh agreed to meet again in New Delhi in January. 
India wants to be recognized as a nuclear weapons power, a demand 
rejected by the United States and other nuclear states. But New Delhi 
has accepted the essence of the treaty by offering a unilateral moratorium 
on nuclear testing. The U.S. wants both India and Pakistan to sign 
the treaty and take steps toward ending 50 years of hostility. The 
test ban treaty must be signed and ratified by 44 countries before 
it can go into effect.
