Frequent transfers of officials, often for political reasons, has 
affected education in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and 
one with low literacy. Education officers posted in the 83 districts 
of Uttar Pradesh average less than 10 weeks on the job, according 
to a state government study released on Saturday. Uttar Pradesh has 
a literacy rate of about 41 percent compared to the national average 
of 53 percent. State officials transferred away from their assignments 
to improve literacy were mostly from Uttar Pradesh districts with 
the lowest literacy. One official in the study was transferred early 
this year after barely two weeks at her post. She was not given a 
reason. The study said frequent transfers and short tenures have directly 
affected the success of literacy programs in the district. It said 
officials had barely settled down before they were transferred so 
lower level officials ``lack a sense of direction'' and suffered from 
low morale. ``There seems to be a lot of wastage of resources because 
of the transfers. There is no proper evaluation or supervision of 
the money spent in the literacy programs,'' said the study, conducted 
by the state's administrative reforms department. State Education 
Minister Ravinder Shukla said the transfers were for ``administrative 
exigencies.'' He refused to elaborate. Officials say privately that 
the transfers are usually for political reasons. Politicians wield 
enormous clout in Utter Pradesh and often transfer officials to remote 
or inhospitable areas if they refuse to comply with their numerous 
requests, most of them illegal.
