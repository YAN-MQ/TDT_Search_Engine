Armed police on Saturday arrested five members of an ethnic party, 
hours after the prime minister suspended civil rights in Sindh province 
and ordered the army to curb violence in Karachi, its troubled main 
city, police said. In an overnight raid, police surrounded a hostel 
run by the ethnic Muttahida Qami Movement (MQM) in Karachi's Azizabad 
neighborhood and arrested five of its members, including two lawmakers 
of the Sindh provincial assembly for keeping illegal weapons. Police 
seized five Kalashnikov rifles and three automatic pistols during 
the raid, a police official said on condition of anonymity. Keeping 
weapons is a non-bailable offense. The accused, including lawmakers 
Shoaib Bukhari and Wakil Ahmed Jamali, will be tried soon by a military 
court, he said. The raid came just hours after Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif ordered the army to help curb violence in the southern province 
and set up of military courts in Karachi to try ``terrorists and criminals'' 
_ a move the MQM says is targeting only its own ethnic group. The 
MQM, a former ally of Sharif, speaks for the political and economic 
rights of Urdu speakers who migrated from India at independence from 
Britain in 1947 and their descendants. The party, formerly known as 
the Mohajir Qami Movement, has controlled the city for more than a 
decade. More than 1,000 people have died in political and religious 
violence in Pakistan's financial and commercial center. The MQM said 
police were violent during the raid. ``They (police) barraged into 
the hostel late in the night and started beating our people,'' Hasan 
Musana, a MQM spokesman, told The Associated Press. Last month Sharif 
dismissed the elected Sindh provincial government of which the MQM 
was a major coalition partner and instituted direct federal rule in 
an attempt to stop violence in Karachi. Sharif has blamed the MQM 
of most of the bloodletting, and for the murder of former governor 
Hakim Said. The MQM denies the charge and blames Sharif for ``state-sponsored 
violence'' against its members. The MQM is fighting with its splinter 
faction, the MQM Haqiqi. Hundreds of people have died in killings 
between these two groups in recent months. Human rights groups and 
opposition parties on Friday criticized the decision to suspend civil 
rights and call the army to help the government. ``It is a mini-martial 
law. The government has no justification of taking such a harsh step,'' 
said Senator Iqbal Haider of the opposition Pakistan Peoples' Party. 
But Sharif said the move is in the interest of the city and the country. 
``We want to get Karachi out of this hell,'' he said. He said military 
courts are needed in Sindh because ``the terrorists threatened witnesses, 
judges and their families'' and have paralyzed the justice system. 
Sharif said military courts reach decisions much more quickly than 
civilian courts, in ``days, not weeks and months.'' In civilian courts, 
the government says criminals easily get bail. The decision of a military 
court cannot be challenged in a civilian court.
