More than two months have passed since Swissair flight 111 crashed 
off novia Scotia, killing all 229 people aboard. For the families 
and for investigators, finding the cause has been painfully slow. 
NBC's Suzanne Malveaux with an update tonight. They work daily, weather 
permitting, doing surveys or collecting debris 190 feet below the 
surface hoping something they bring up will be the key to solving 
the mystery. Now investigators are getting some high-tech help, a 
device called a Laser-line scanner has been installed on a coast guard 
ship. Very few of these systems in the world, very high technology. 
It uses a blue-green laser that's shot out through a reflecting mirror 
bouncing off the sea floor to give us an image about 14 meters wide. 
Under water work began shortly after the crash. 80% of the plane has 
now been recovered, but that includes only about 40% of the cockpit 
section. That wreckage is of particular interest to investigators, 
because before the plane lost power, the crew reported smoke in the 
cockpit. Heat damage patterns could provide important clues about 
the source. Investigators had a cockpit frame made so they could do 
a reconstruction. But none of the wreckage recovered so far has answered 
the key question -- "Did a wiring problem cause a fire which disabled 
the aircraft?" Progress is slow. We have to recognize that we're in 
for a long-term project here. Tons of debris, some of it small enough 
to fit in one hand, will be closely examined in the months ahead.
