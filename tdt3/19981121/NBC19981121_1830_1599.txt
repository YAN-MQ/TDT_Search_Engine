Finally tonight -- bad news for fans of tradition in England. The 
seat of government in London is no longer a place for powdered wigs 
and men in tights. From London, here's NBC's donatella lorch. The 
lord chancellor is tired of wearing tights. Nor is lord Irvine fond 
of his buckled slippers or his horsehair wig which he says weighs 
a ton. For several months the head of Britain's Judiciary has been 
pushing for an end to this 17th-century costume. I feel that for male 
adults of sound mind like myself, I hope I am, the days of breeches, 
tights and buckled shoes should go. Finally, he's gotten his way. 
The house of lords has voted 145 to 115 in favor of allowing lord 
Irvine to dress down, part of an effort to modernize British government. 
That's the way we're going. We're out with tradition and in with the 
new. From now on, for most occasions, lord Irvine may wear a business 
suit. Slowly, Britain is letting go of some of the archaic customs 
which, many say, make the country seem more like a theme park than 
a modern nation. Until three months ago, lord Irvine had to walk backwards 
in front of the queen at the opening of parliament. And someone known 
as the silver stick in waiting used to be part of the ceremony. But 
many traditionalists are worried that lord Irvine's tights are just 
the tip of the iceberg and that the very essence of Britain is being 
attacked. It's like a salami slicing, next year we will have something 
else. Yes, today the tights, tomorrow the queen. But for the moment, 
many of the old traditions remain. As one person put it, "that's the 
way we do things here." But for how long? Who knows? Donatella lorch, 
NBC news, London.
