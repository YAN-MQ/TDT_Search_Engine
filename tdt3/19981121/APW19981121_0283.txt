The Russian government Saturday failed to approve any of three proposed 
versions of a draft budget for 1999 and called for more revisions, 
including changes on external debt servicing and tax reform. ``The 
government's presidium didn't accept any of the proposed plans on 
the 1999 budget,'' Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said after 
a four-hour meeting of key government ministers. ``More work is needed,'' 
he said. The government has been trying to persuade foreign creditors 
to restructure at least a portion of some dlrs 17 billion payments 
due in 1999. ``Only when we know how much we will have to pay on our 
external debts (next year), we will be able to set our fiscal policy,'' 
Shapovalyants said. The government hopes to complete drafting its 
1999 budget by Dec. 1, but it will require more details on the planned 
tax reform for next year, Shapovalyants said. ``We have to finalize 
volumes of (expected) tax collections and set new tax brackets,'' 
he said. The three versions put the disparity between revenues and 
spending at either 150 billion rubles (dlrs 9 billion), 280 billion 
rubles (dlrs 16 billion), or 360 billion rubles (dlrs 21 billion), 
according to one senior government official, who spoke Friday on the 
condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov met Saturday 
with an International Monetary Fund delegation after the meeting to 
discuss the country's economic situation, the Interfax news agency 
said. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said on Friday that 
Russia will ask the IMF for new terms on repaying the dlrs 4.6 billion 
due to the lending organization next year. New IMF loans to Russia 
have been on hold since August. The IMF has insisted it will not release 
any more money until the government comes up with a comprehensive 
plan to combat the economic crisis and starts implementing it.
