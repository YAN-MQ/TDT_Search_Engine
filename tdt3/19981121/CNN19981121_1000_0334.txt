Palestinians are calling on Israel to halt Jewish settlement activity 
in the West Bank. Israel has begun withdrawing its troops from parts 
of the northern West Bank as called for in the new Middle East interim 
accord. But some Jewish settlers who oppose the peace deal are taking 
over West Bank hilltops to prevent them from someday being handed 
over to the palestinians.
