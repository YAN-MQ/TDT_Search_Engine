People who invest in real estate typically do so secure in the knowledge 
that their little patch of land can be theirs _ or their heirs' _ 
forever. Even those who buy co-op or condominium apartments generally 
take comfort in owning a home _ indirectly in the case of a co-op, 
where they own shares in the building _ that they can pass on to their 
children when they die. But there is another form of real estate investment, 
known as a ground-lease co-op, that falls somewhere between renting 
and owning a home. And, depending on whom you talk to, the purchase 
of an apartment in a ground-lease co-op can be a great deal, a situation 
with unpredictable risks or something in between. ``Owning a co-op 
with a ground lease is like having a chronic rash,'' said Alan Kucker, 
a Manhattan co-op lawyer. ``It's not going to kill you, but it's always 
there and it sure can be irritating.'' Kucker explained that a relatively 
small number of New York co-ops are on land that the co-op corporation 
itself does not own. In such cases, he said, the co-op typically leases 
the ground from the owner of the property _ frequently, the co-op's 
original sponsor. Generally, he said, the lease provides for rent 
to be paid on the land over a fairly long term, often up to 99 years, 
and contain provisions for extending the lease and increasing the 
rent at specific intervals. There is, however, another consideration: 
``At the end of the lease, the building usually reverts to the owner 
of the property,'' Kucker said. ``That's where things start to get 
hairy.'' For example, he said, when an ordinary co-op needs to borrow 
money for capital improvements, the co-op corporation can go to a 
lender and take out a new mortgage. A ground-lease co-op, however, 
would not be able to do that _ at least not easily _ because a lender 
usually wants the mortgage secured by both the structure and the land. 
And if the co-op doesn't own the land, it can't provide the lender 
with the security it requires. Even if the co-op could persuade a 
lender to take only the building as collateral, Kucker said, some 
ground leases require the co-op to get the property owner's permission 
to do so. ``We had one ground-lease co-op that had a restriction in 
the lease that said the co-op couldn't borrow money without the permission 
of the property owner,'' he said. ``Every time we would go to the 
owner to get his permission, he would hassle us.'' Notwithstanding 
such problems, however, there doesn't appear to be any shortage of 
buyers for co-op units in buildings with ground leases. ``Today's 
buyers are more educated than ever before,'' said Rhea Stein, a sales 
agent for the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage. ``And once they 
understand how these buildings work they become much more open to 
them because they realize that the lease can work in their favor.'' 
For example, Ms. Stein said, she recently sold a two-bedroom, two-bath 
co-op unit in a ground-lease building in Tudor City for $350,000. 
``That's at least $50,000 less than it would have commanded in a non-land-leased 
building,'' she said. In fact, Ms. Stein said, in the last year alone 
she has sold six apartments in the same 300-plus-unit building _ 2 
Tudor City Place, which is the only building in the seven-building 
midtown complex that has a ground lease. Ms. Stein's employer, Barbara 
Corcoran, is herself an owner of a ground-lease co-op on the Upper 
East Side. ``Another advantage to purchasing in a land-lease property 
is that the owners typically keep them in excellent physical and fiscal 
condition to woo buyers with value and quality,'' Ms. Corcoran said. 
William Greenberg, a Manhattan accountant who specializes in co-op 
and condominium finances, has somewhat different feelings about co-ops 
with ground leases. ``If you're in one, you can be faced with some 
serious problems,'' Greenberg said. ``I've seen some absolutely unbelievable 
increases in ground rents.'' He said that in some leases, the rent 
paid by the co-op to the property owner is calculated as a percentage 
of the appraised value of the property. In addition, most leases contain 
clauses that provide for an increase in rent after a certain time, 
often 10 years or so. Accordingly, Greenberg said, an appreciable 
increase in the value of the property from one rent adjustment to 
another can result in a big increase in rent that will be reflected 
in each shareholder's monthly maintenance fees. Moreover, he said, 
since the property owner and the co-op frequently obtain widely different 
appraisals, the matter must often be resolved by arbitration. ``That 
can end up being an expensive procedure for everyone concerned,'' 
he said. Another disadvantage of owing a co-op in a building with 
a ground lease, he said, is that the portion of maintenance charges 
used to pay the ground rent is not deductible on shareholders' tax 
returns. If the co-op owned the property subject to an underlying 
mortgage, on the other hand, the portion of maintenance attributable 
to interest on the loan would be deductible. ``That's why I try to 
persuade the buildings I work for to do everything possible to try 
and buy the property from the owner,'' Greenberg said. ``But the one 
big problem is to get the landowner to agree.'' Kucker, the co-op 
lawyer, has had some experience in that regard. ``We had a small building 
in Brooklyn that was paying $500 a year in ground rent to the owner,'' 
Kucker said. ``We went to him and said, `We'll give you $50,000 to 
buy you out,' and he said `No.' We ended up paying him $100,000 just 
to be free of the hassle.'' Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer and 
vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said that 
those thinking of buying into a building with a ground lease should 
make sure they have sufficient information to make an informed decision. 
``You want to know both the term of the lease and whether it provides 
for any extensions,'' Weinstein said, explaining that while a lease 
with 40 years left on an initial term of 99 years might have been 
a safe investment 59 years ago, it is less so now and will be a dubious 
investment 20 years in the future. ``You also need to know how rent 
increases are going to be calculated,'' he said. ``If the lease contains 
a regular escalation clause, that's not a problem. But if the increases 
are tied to market value appraisals, that can be a real killer.'' 
On the other hand, Weinstein said, it is certainly possible for buyers 
to get more apartment for their money when purchasing in a ground-lease 
co-op. Benjamin Klapper, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who recently 
bought a three-bedroom apartment in a ground-lease co-op on the Upper 
East Side, agreed. ``Of course I would prefer not to have a ground 
lease on the building,'' Klapper said. ``But I ended up getting an 
apartment I couldn't have gotten under other circumstances. And eventually 
we'll have to sit down with the owner and try to buy the land from 
him. But I think that's something every board in a ground-lease co-op 
should ultimately consider.''
