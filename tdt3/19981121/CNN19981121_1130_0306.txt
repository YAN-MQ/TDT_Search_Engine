Federal officials say they've indicted 31 people in a smuggling ring 
that brought in about 12,000 illegal immigrants to the United States. 
The immigration and naturalization service says it's the largest illegal 
immigrant operation ever uncovered. The ring charged about $20,000 
per person and made over $200 million in three years. Most of the 
aliens came from India. Others were from Afghanistan, Pakistan and 
Syria. Attorney general Janet Reno says the crackdown is a warning 
to those who flout U.S. immigration laws. .
