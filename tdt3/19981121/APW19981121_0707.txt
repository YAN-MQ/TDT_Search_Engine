Urska Hrovat of Slovenia lost most of a huge first-run margin but 
still held off Sabine Egger of Austria by .38 seconds to win a women's 
World Cup slalom Saturday. Croatian teen-ager Janca Kostelic, predicted 
to reach greatness in the future, showed some on Saturday by taking 
third, giving her a podium finish in only her fifth World Cup start. 
Hrovat dominated the morning run, leading by 1.1 seconds, and that 
margin paid off in victory in the afternoon. Egger, fifth after the 
first run but 1.48 seconds back, skied brilliantly in carving more 
than a second off the leader's time. Hrovat's winning aggregate was 
1 minute, 36.91 seconds. Egger finished in 1:37.29 for second with 
Kostelic in 1:37.60. Hrovat got her fifth career victory with a solid 
if unspectacular run. She made use of her huge lead, keeping her skis 
away from danger after Egger and Kostelic had skied on the edge in 
an effort to catch up. ``After the first run, I just really felt safe,'' 
Hrovat said. ``I said, `OK, for the second run, you must come down, 
you don't need to attack so much,' because I was so much ahead of 
the others. ``I just said keep it going and it will be enough,'' she 
added. ``Just push but use your head.'' Until Egger came along, it 
looked as if the 16-year-old Croatian, who started 53rd and placed 
12th in the morning run, might write an improbable chapter in World 
Cup history. Her time of 46.12 seconds was the fastest of the afternoon 
and vaulted her nine spots in the standings. Egger almost matched 
it with a 46.14-second effort while Hrovat, safely ahead the entire 
way, needed only a 47.24 to climb the top step of the podium. Kostelic 
appeared cool amid the uproar over her performance. ``I wasn't nervous,'' 
she insisted. ``The first run in Cortina last year I was nervous,'' 
since it was her first World Cup event. ``I didn't think I'd do so 
well,'' she admitted. ``I though if I could get into the second run, 
I'd be very happy. this is like a dream.'' It was a disappointing 
for defending champion Ylva Nowen of Sweden, who had to rally just 
to take 10th, 1.36 seconds behind. And defending race champion Zali 
Steggall of Australia was unable to keep pace after sitting second 
in the mornng, slipping back to seventh in the final rendering. While 
Kostelic gave Croatia its first-ever World Cup podium, Vicky Grau 
gave tiny Andorra its first points, placing 19th.
