Friday's enormous tobacco settlement with 46 states could leave some 
gaps the federal government might try to fill. California senator 
Dianne Feinstein says she already has asked the Senate judiciary committee 
to consider drafting legislation, to address national policy issues 
not covered by the settlement. Under the state deal, tobacco companies 
will pay $206 billion and give up advertisements on billboards, public 
transportation and apparel. And they will cover the health costs of 
treating smokers, and help fund anti-smoking education programs. This 
is a good deal for the state of Indiana. Our responsibility in weighing 
the options that we have right now is to do what is best, first of 
all for the children of Indiana, and secondly, what is best for the 
tax payers. As in all public affairs, no solution is perfect. But 
I am convinced to a moral certainty that I must execute this settlement 
about which I have been speaking for and on behave of the people of 
the state of Michigan. The tobacco industry says it will sign the 
deal Monday. It is warning the price of cigarettes may rise $0.40 
a pack to help pay for the settlement.
