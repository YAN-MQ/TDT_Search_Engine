President Clinton saw a familiar face in Seoul, south Korea, today. 
His younger brother, Roger, was the headline act in a local variety 
show. The president watched his brother's band play some songs. Then 
Roger Clinton announced there was a "very special person" in the crowd, 
and the president walked out on stage. The crowd of 3,900 people gave 
Mr. Clinton a warm ovation. The show will be televised in Korea.
