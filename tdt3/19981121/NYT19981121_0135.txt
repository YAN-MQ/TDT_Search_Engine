In his most extensive remarks in weeks about the scandal shadowing 
his presidency, President Clinton said with a sad smile Saturday that 
he is still suffering privately over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, 
but that his political punishment was strictly up to Congress. ``For 
me, this long ago ceased to be a political issue or a legal issue 
and became a personal one,'' Clinton said. ``And every day I do my 
best to put it right, personally.'' He spoke in answer to a question 
about whether Congress should punish his behavior, during an appearance 
before reporters with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung. Clinton 
smiled at first and suggested that he felt plenty punished already. 
``There has been a lot of suffering,'' he said. ``That is different 
from punishment, although it's hard to see the difference sometimes 
as you're going through it.'' But the smile faded and Clinton began 
to stare down toward the white carpet as he said that it was ``not 
appropriate at this time'' for him to express an opinion on how Congress 
should act. The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings 
last week into charges that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed 
justice in hiding his affair. ``I trust the American people,'' the 
president said, ``and I hope Congress will do the right thing in a 
nonpolitical way, if you will, to get beyond the partisanship and 
go on.'' The White House has argued that Clinton should not be impeached 
for the offenses spelled out in a report to Congress by independent 
counsel Kenneth Starr. Joe Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman, said that 
the president interpreted the question Saturday to refer not to impeachment 
but to some intermediate measure, such as censure. Lockhart said that 
while it was proper for the White House to resist impeachment, it 
would be wrong for it ``to be in a position of trying to prescribe'' 
a punishment short of that. White House aides are anxious about seeming 
overconfident or offending members of Congress by publicly suggesting 
that they should short-circuit the impeachment process and offer a 
deal. Some Democrats and moderate Republicans have floated the notion 
of censure, but Lockhart said, ``I don't believe there is anything 
at this point that is specific or concrete that has been brought to 
our attention.'' Clinton did not bristle at Saturday's question, which 
he fielded in a formal appearance in the Blue House, site of the Korean 
president's office and residence. Standing to Clinton's left, Kim, 
for decades a dissident campaigning for democracy here, remained impassive. 
Clinton has seemed increasingly confident recently about his political 
position. On Friday night in Tokyo, he practically sought out reporters 
to assure them he was paying little attention to the hearings back 
in Washington. ``I've been here working on these economic and security 
issues,'' he said. On a five-day trip to Japan, Korea and Guam, Clinton 
is scheduled to return to Washington on Monday night. Saturday, Clinton 
noted for the first time that Starr had testified to Congress last 
week that he had not found any impeachable offenses in his investigations 
of the Whitewater real estate deal, the dismissal of the staff of 
the White House travel office or in the administration's improper 
gathering of hundreds of FBI files on former Republican officials. 
Clinton called that development a ``long-awaited acknowledgment.''
