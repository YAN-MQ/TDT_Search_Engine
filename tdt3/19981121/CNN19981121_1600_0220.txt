President Clinton is continuing his Asian tour by visiting south Korea. 
He says north Korea should seize a historic opportunity for peace 
with south Korea and stay away from nuclear weapons. But U.S. military 
officials tell CNN north Korea may be preparing to conduct another 
ballistic missile test like it did in August. South Korean President 
Kim Dae-Jung says he won't tolerate any attempts to build weapons 
of mass destruction north of his border.
