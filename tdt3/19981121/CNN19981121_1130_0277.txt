Big tobacco companies are scheduled to sign a $206 billion deal Monday 
that settles the health claims of 46 states. It's the biggest payout 
ever in an American civil suit. The money will be used to cover the 
costs incurred by state health agencies in treating smoking-related 
illnesses. The deal also calls for an end to billboard advertising 
of tobacco products. The price of a pack of cigarettes will probably 
increase 35 to 40 cents as a result of the settlement.
