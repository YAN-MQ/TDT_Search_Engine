FedEx and its pilots' union say there will be no strike over the busy 
holidays. Friday the pilots' union agreed to go back to the bargaining 
table to negotiate its first worker contract. Talks broke off last 
month over pay raises. By agreeing to resume talks, both sides enter 
into a 60-day cooling off period in which the pilots can't strike. 
FedEx says there will be no delay in package and cargo shipments.
