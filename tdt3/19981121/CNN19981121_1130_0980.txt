The recent downturn in international economic growth has some businesses 
scaling back costs. Lori Waffenschmidt looks at the resulting effect 
on business travel in this edition of "working ahead." Some businesses 
are scaling back corporate trips, but for most companies it's travel 
as usual. In fact, many travel experts say the bookings will remain 
strong well into next year. I have talked to several cruise lines 
and travel agents, while there is talk and fear that a recession is 
coming, the reality is there has been very little dropoff in bookings. 
We haven't seen a decline in the business travel, if anything we have 
seen an increase in the leisure business coming to our hotels. Tourists 
will still find hotels expensive and seats on airlines hard to get, 
especially during the holidays. You're probably still going to pay 
a lot for a hotel on Wednesday nights. Airfare sales are going to 
happen very, very soon. There is not going to be room for anybody, 
for free let alone a paying passenger. Which means booking ahead and 
getting their early.
