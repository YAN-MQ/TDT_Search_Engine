Almost 40 years ago, an Alfred hitchcock film called "psycho" turned 
showering into a terrifying experience. Judging from the reaction 
in Boston, it may do so again. The Massachusetts bay transportation 
authority, which runs the city's subway system, is removing posters 
promoting a remake of the movie after more than a dozen patrons complained 
they were too graphic. The posters show a woman behind a shower door, 
standing in a pool of blood.
