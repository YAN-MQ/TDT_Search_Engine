For most people, traffic tickets are as welcome as dental work. But 
this is Hollywood, and Jeremiah Gerbracht and his dog, Lady Harley, 
think of them as tickets to fame. In the three years since Gerbracht, 
58, got the Siberian husky, with eyes the color of ice, he has been 
ticketed five times for riding his Harley-Davidson with the dog hunched 
on the gas tank. He has gone to court in the first three cases, championing 
his right to ride with his dog aboard. Each time, he has won partly 
because the language of the vehicle code, which prohibits unsafe riding 
by people, does not apply to animals. ``There is absolutely no law 
that prevents animals from riding on a motorcycle,'' Gerbracht says. 
And, he insists, he has a civil right to take the dog with him, because 
Harley is a hearing dog, and Gerbracht has impaired hearing. But behind 
Gerbracht's quixotic court fight is the fact that with each traffic 
citation and each quirky news account that follows, he is writing 
his own ticket to membership in the small but visible fraternity of 
eccentric icons in Los Angeles _ no small feat in a city where everyone, 
it seems, is vying for attention. Hollywood is dotted with billboards 
advertising the buxom Angelyne, whose business is being famous for 
her fame. Harry Perry, the roller-skating, electric-guitar-playing 
Sikh, is a fixture of the Venice Beach boardwalk. And there is Dennis 
Woodruff, whose self-publicized struggle to become an actor led him 
to arrange his own surname atop his car in the fashion of the Hollywood 
sign, W-O-O-D-R-U-F-F. To that list add Gerbracht and Lady Harley. 
``I think that there's a kind of mentality out here that people come 
out here to be stars, and to get noticed and to do their thing,'' 
said Ajay Sahgal, a Los Angeles author whose novel ``Pool'' dealt 
with the perils of fame. ``Some of these people live on the fringe, 
but they get noticed.'' Gerbracht moved west from Phoenix, N.Y., in 
1966 and soon gained recognition for having a dog, Jenny, that could 
climb trees. There were near misses getting the dog on ``The Bionic 
Woman'' program and ``The Tonight Show'' in the 1970s. The lure of 
Hollywood brought him south to Los Angeles permanently in 1977, and 
he built up a healthy packet of press clippings about his dog. Jenny 
died in 1987, but Gerbracht was drawn to Harley in 1995 by the feeling 
that she was the reincarnation of his previous dog. They were soon 
going for rides on the motorcycle together _ another thing Jenny enjoyed 
_ and getting traffic tickets. The first two, under the code that 
prohibits people from riding on something not designed for passengers 
and from interfering with the driver, were thrown out because they 
did not apply to an animal. Gerbracht was found not guilty last week 
on his third ticket, for unsafe operation of a vehicle. He has not 
yet gone to court on the others. Gerbracht's court battles have been 
well documented by the media, thanks in part to his promotional efforts, 
and he sees his story as an antidote to stories about war, famine 
and politics. All of which, true to Hollywood's essence, Gerbracht 
thinks would make a good movie. Or better yet, three. The first, he 
says, would deal with Jenny's rise to fame for climbing trees, and 
would end, after Jenny's death, with Gerbracht meeting Lady Harley. 
In the second, tentatively titled ``Once Upon a Ride,'' Harley strives 
for world fame on behalf of Jenny by riding on motorcycles. In the 
third movie, ``Once Upon a Ride Again!'' Harley and Gerbracht take 
off on a worldwide trip, their fame and popularity growing as they 
ride, culminating with a hero's welcome in Los Angeles. ``Wouldn't 
it be wonderful,'' Gerbracht said, ``going into the new millennium 
with stories like a new Benji, Lassie, Rin Tin Tin type stories, rather 
than the heavy-duty garbage?''
