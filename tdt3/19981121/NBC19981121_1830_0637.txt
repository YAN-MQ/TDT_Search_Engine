From Russia tonight -- outrage over the murder of a leading liberal 
lawmaker, one of the most prominent women in parliament and a potential 
candidate for president. Galina staro voitova was found shot to death 
last night in her apartment building. An aide was also wounded. Hundreds 
of supporters are in mourning. President Yeltsin has ordered an investigation. 
The motive, so far, is unclear.
