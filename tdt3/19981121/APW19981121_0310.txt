President Omar el-Bashir Saturday warned opposition groups based in 
neighboring Eritrea and Ethiopia that Sudan was about to mend fences 
with the two Horn of Africa nations. Relations between Sudan and its 
two neighbors have been fraught with tension for several years. Ethiopia 
and Eritrea accuse Sudan of supporting groups opposed to their governments. 
Khartoum levels a similar charge against the two. If it materializes, 
a rapprochement between Khartoum and the two countries would greatly 
undermine the Sudanese opposition, possibly ending its freedom to 
use their territories to launch attacks against government forces 
in the east and southeast of Sudan. Bashir, who seized power in Sudan 
in a 1989 military coup, said an agreement ending hostilities with 
Ethiopia and Eritrea would be signed soon and that opposition politicians 
based there would either have to return home or become refugees. ``We 
want peace and we want to develop our country,'' said Bashir, speaking 
in the state of Gedarif near the Ethiopian border. ``They (opposition) 
will have only two options: either return home and find out that we 
have opened the door to political association and they can organize 
themselves to lead opposition groups, or they can go to refugee camps.'' 
Bashir also claimed that Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi had 
turned down a request for arms from Sudanese opposition groups, who 
also demanded a halt to overtures by Addis Ababa toward Khartoum. 
``But Zenawi told them no such thing was going to happen anymore. 
There will be no border war with Sudan, and no incursions anymore,'' 
Bashir said.
