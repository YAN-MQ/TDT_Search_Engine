A cold front moving across the eastern U.S. will stall near lake okeechobee, 
Florida. Look for scattered showers and thunderstorms to remain in 
your southern florida forecast and in the gulf generally south of 
New Orleans. A strong cold front system in the north will mean snow 
showers for the james bay, Quebec and Ontario. And continuing rain 
for the west coast with snow, some of it heavy inland across Idaho, 
Montana and into Wyoming. High temperatures will be in the 60s and 
70s for the most of the southwestern deserts, 60s from Texas northward 
into Nebraska. You'll see 70s and 80s for central and southern Florida 
while the north remains in the grip of cold temperatures. Most of 
New England and the western lakes will see the 30s and 40s for saturday. 
The extended forecast includes a warm-up across the north but heavy 
rainfall in the northwest coast, with heavy showers and a few thunderstorms 
in the east. Rain moves eastward on Tuesday, with scattered thunderstorms 
remaining over the gulf coast, heavy rain and showers stay in your 
pacific northwest forecast through Wednesday. The extended forecast 
for more than 7,000 cities is at CNN.com.
