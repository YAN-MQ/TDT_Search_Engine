The world wide web is helping children find solutions in a world full 
of problems. Bruce Francis explains. Not everyone has access to Internet, 
right? Yeah. Yeah. This is the junior summit, a project of M.I.T.'s 
media lab. 100 kids from around the world are gathering at the famed 
institution, sharing very adult ideas on how to attack the world's 
problems. For months before the conference began, they hashed it out 
on the web in virtual discussion groups -- how to heal the environment, 
end child labor or improve education -- talk tinged with media savvy. 
If they would sponsor us, that would be excellent. Many of the kids 
who were selected based on essays come from countries where the Internet 
is almost the exclusive domain of the wealthy. I don't think that 
money should determine the education that you get, or the opportunities 
you have, which it does, which is sad. But Internet access is something 
that we correct and we can improve the educational system. What do 
you guys think of proposing kid representatives in the U.N.? And the 
kids are doing much more than just talking. We've started a petition 
actually, we have, and I've got -- we've got about, more than 1,000 
signatures already. So we plan to give it to the companies which use 
child labor, hoping that they will stop exploiting the kids. The kids 
may be deeply involved with technology, but here at the m.I.T. media 
lab, where the cutting edge is honed, the kids have relatively little 
interest in the fastest chips and the latest software. A group of 
children met with me to tell me that they were sick and tired of computer 
bloat. They thought all of these fast processors, all of these were 
unnecessary. They wanted affordable computing for them and their countries. 
I don't think there's an adult that understands that. Bruce Francis, 
"CNN Financial News," Cambridge, Massachusetts.
