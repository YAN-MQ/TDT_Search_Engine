In what would be the biggest takeover of an American financial institution 
by a foreign bank, Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, is on 
the verge of signing an agreement to buy Bankers Trust Corp., the 
eighth-largest American bank, according to executives involved in 
the talks. The deal, for $7.5 billion to $8 billion, could be announced 
as early as this week and its price could go higher as details are 
negotiated, they said. The current price represents only a small premium 
to the total value of Bankers Trust's shares in the stock market. 
The planned deal is another reminder of the scale and the reach of 
some of the huge international mergers already witnessed this year. 
Corporations have shown an increasing willingness to merge regardless 
of where they are based. Even so, such large deals are never simple 
to carry out, especially when the corporation created by a megamerger 
spans the globe. In that regard, Deutsche Bank, a commercial banking 
powerhouse that has already had difficulties with recent forays into 
the investment banking world, will face an enormous challenge in making 
the planned acquisition of Bankers Trust a success. Bankers Trust, 
having survived a series of financial scandals that tarnished its 
reputation and hurt its bottom line, has been refashioning itself 
as investment banker to the world's smaller, faster-growing companies. 
It has also carved out a niche underwriting and trading high-yield 
debt, so-called junk bonds. But Bankers Trust has lacked the heft 
needed to compete with powerful Wall Street competitors. Deutsche 
Bank has openly sought an acquisition in the United States to make 
a breakthrough into investment banking. Its planned acquisition of 
Bankers Trust will certainly raise Deutsche Bank's visibility on Wall 
Street, but it does not immediately grant it a commanding presence 
in the investment banking market. Bankers Trust is not a leader in 
overall stock and bond underwriting, nor is it in the top ranks of 
companies that provide advice on mergers and acquisitions, activities 
that provide some of the biggest profits on Wall Street.
