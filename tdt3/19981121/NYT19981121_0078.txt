It was not the first time in the history of solo yacht racing that 
computer technology saved the life of a sailor in distress. But e-mail 
assistance provided recently by a physician in Boston reached out 
as never before to an ailing yachtsman at sea. ``Can you imagine?'' 
asked Viktor Yazykov, the 50-year-old Russian competing in the Around 
Alone race, during a telephone interview Tuesday from Cape Town. ``I 
was 1,000 miles out in the ocean, alone in my sailboat with a little 
lake of blood on the floor around me, and with the boat rolling from 
side to side. I think to myself, `I am going to die.' '' Help, however, 
was never farther away than the blip of his on-board computer screen. 
E-mail advice was delivered by the Comsat-C satellite network from 
Dr. Dan Carlin, an emergency medicine specialist at New England Medical 
Center in Boston. It was the next best thing to a house call considering 
that Yazykov was under sail in the South Atlantic. The episode began 
benignly enough. Yazykov had bruised his elbow before setting out 
last Oct. 2 from Charleston, S.C., in the around-the-world sailboat 
competition. He was six days late for the start; 15 solo skippers 
had left before him on a 6,865-mile voyage to Cape Town, the race's 
first stopover. Already the leading boat had a 1,000-mile jump on 
him. Another competitor, Sebastian Reidl of Canada, would drop out 
with gear problems along the way. But Yazykov, a former Russian paratrooper 
and disaster worker in Chernobyl, had dealt with adversity before. 
To pull away from the dock aboard his 40-foot sloop, Wind of Change, 
was tantamount to a fresh beginning at the upside of a hard life. 
As chief executive officer of World Clinic, a global medical practice, 
Carlin responded Nov. 10 to Yazykov's e-mail query about what to do 
for a painful and swollen elbow. Exacerbated by a language barrier 
and a dwindling power supply to Yazykov's laptop, the Russian's troubles 
got worse before they improved. Using the on-board medical kit that 
Carlin provided each race skipper at the outset, Yazykov had single-handedly 
_ and without anesthetic _ opened his wound and cleaned it under Carlin's 
directions. Only later did Carlin find out that Yazykov had been taking 
large amounts of aspirin before seeking help. The blood-thinning property 
of aspirin was causing Yazykov's inch-long incision to bleed profusely. 
In panic, and without consulting Carlin, Yazykov tied two shock cords 
around the limb to stop the blood flow. Then he strapped his arm to 
the boat's overhead handrail in an effort to keep it suspended. The 
tourniquet cut off circulation, and left his arm numb after two hours. 
In the last e-mail of the evening, Yazykov explained what was happening. 
Carlin messaged him to cut the arm free immediately, and to apply 
gentle compression. ``His limb was clearly in jeopardy,'' Carlin said 
from Boston. ``This was a solo sailor in a moderate gale. He was despairing. 
There was blood all over the boat, and his arm was completely lifeless. 
Imagine what it must have been like.'' Tired and weak from the effort, 
Yazykov fell asleep for the night. In a cryptic e-mail message to 
race officials before arriving in Cape Town on Monday, Yazykov said: 
``I could manage few words e-mail to Carlin asking what to do now, 
not to elbow, but to save arm. Remembered red wine helps to make new 
blood, drink half a bottle and eat chocolate. Deadly tired, fell asleep. 
``Awaked in morning. The sun gave life to the battery. Check the e-mail 
_ 10 messages from the race office. `Viktor, how are you?' '' The 
response made Carlin's day. It also reaffirmed his conviction that 
telemedicine has a future. ``For every Viktor Yazykov, there's a village 
in China,'' he said later. When Yazykov arrived in Cape Town on Monday, 
life was coming back into his arm. He was also energized by news that 
he had set a race record to Cape Town for 40-foot boats. Although 
he was ahead of four other competitors in his class, an 11-hour race 
penalty for being late at the start has put him at the back. Still, 
he is eager to point Wind of Change into a new breeze. On Dec. 5, 
the second stage of the Around Alone begins with a 6,884-mile voyage 
to New Zealand. ``I have seen death a few times in my life,'' Yazykov 
said. ``It has been pretty tough life. But I like it.''
