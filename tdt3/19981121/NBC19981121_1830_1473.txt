When "NBC nightly news" continues in a moment -- the move to remove 
some of the starch in Great Britain. MA, if you have trouble sleeping, 
take a unisom. It helped last time, didn't it? Didn't you feel better 
after a good night's sleep? It's O.K. the doctor said it's not habit 
forming. That's right. Unisom. MA, there's nothing wrong with helping 
yourself get a good night's sleep. All right? I love you, too. We 
were on vacation in New Orleans. Great city, but every night I got 
this awful heartburn. A woman in our tour group said "here, try Zantac 
75." "Oh, thank you," I said, "you're a Saint." She said, "no, actually, 
I'm a doctor." The medicine in Zantac 75 is the #1 doctor-prescribed 
acid reducer. It relieves even your toughest heartburn controlling 
acid for up to 12 hours. Maybe a doctor and a Saint. Zantac 75.
