Terry Nichols has asked the federal appeals court in Denver for a 
new trial in the Oklahoma City bombing, contending that the federal 
judge who presided over his case erred at both his trial and his sentencing. 
Last December, a federal court jury in Denver convicted Nichols, 43, 
a military-surplus dealer, of conspiring with his former Army buddy, 
Timothy McVeigh, to bomb the Oklahoma City federal building, where 
168 people died on April 19, 1995. Nichols was also convicted on eight 
counts of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of the eight federal 
law-enforcement agents killed in the bombing. In June, Judge Richard 
Matsch of U.S. District Court in Denver sentenced Nichols to life 
in prison and ordered him to pay the General Services Administration, 
which manages federal properties, $14.5 million in restitution for 
the destruction of the building. Nichols' lawyers, Michael Tigar, 
Susan Foreman and Adam Thurschwell, filed their brief in the appeals 
court on Thursday. They contended that Matsch erred in the instructions 
he gave the jurors, in the testimony he permitted and in his interpretation 
of federal sentencing guidelines. The judge erred, they contended, 
when he told the jury that Nichols' responsibility for the deaths 
of people killed as a result of the bombing conspiracy did not depend 
on proof that he intended to kill anyone. An intent to kill, Nichols' 
lawyers argued, is a necessary element in the offense. The jurors 
who convicted Nichols of conspiracy acquitted him of blowing up the 
building and of first- or second-degree murder in the deaths of the 
officers. Nichols' lawyers also contended that Nichols should have 
been sentenced under federal guidelines for arson and property damage, 
not first-degree murder, and that the order for restitution was punitive 
and ignored Nichols' inability to pay.
