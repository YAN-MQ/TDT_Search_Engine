Republicans are challenging President Clinton to take the lead on 
a plan to reform social security. In the GOP's radio address, house 
ways and means committee chairman Bill archer said the plan should 
treat current and future retirees equally, it should not increase 
taxes and it should provide a safety net for the disabled. Archer 
would also like new retirement options for younger workers. Saving 
social security will require presidential leadership. It will require 
specifics. It will require something only President Clinton can provide. 
I urge him to make this the finest hour of his presidency. Just as 
only a republican president could go to China, democratic president 
bill Clinton has a chance to change the course of social security. 
Lift up our nation, Mr. president. Put principles before politics 
and ideas before ambition. If you lead, together, we can be successful. 
Archer says if the president does not submit a plan, it will make 
it more difficult, if not impossible, to save social security.
