Australians are celebrating the great blue yonder and the open road 
this weekend. The aviex '98 air show is blazing over the skies of 
Sydney. The red barons of the Australian air force kicked off the 
two-day event with some death-defying stunts. 200 civilian and military 
aircraft are on display. Australia also is marking the 50th anniversary 
of its legendary motor car, the original fx Holden.
