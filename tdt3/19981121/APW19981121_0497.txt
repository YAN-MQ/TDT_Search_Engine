PARIS (AP) - Russian Maria Butyrskaya rallied from third to beat American 
Nicole Bobek to take the women's event at the Lalique Trophy figure 
skating competition Saturday. Sarah Abitbol and Stephane Benardis 
of France won the pairs program for their major international victory. 
Although Butyrskaya fell once while Bobek stayed up, the Russian did 
the more difficult jumps and was rewarded with her second Grand Prix 
victory of the season. She won also at Skate America. Leading after 
the short program, Bobek was looking for her first major victory since 
the 1995 U.S. title. It was not to be. Although Bobek's music to ``Evita'' 
was inspiring, her skating was not. Bobek started well with a triple 
lutz-double toe loop combination. Then she proceeded to scale down 
three triple jumps to doubles in her next four attempts. She ended 
with just three triples and was disappointed and wiped tears from 
her eyes while waiting for her marks. She scored technical marks between 
5.0 to 5,4 and only a little better in the presentation marks. Butyrskaya 
skated well enough to win. Opening with a good triple lutz and adding 
three more triples, she scored more than two-tenths better than Bobek 
on nearly every mark to win easily. Although Butyrskaya went down 
on one triple jump and had to put a hand down on another, the overall 
quality and quantity of the jumps gave her the win. Third went to 
Vanessa Gusmeroli of France, overtaking Elena Liashenko of Ukraine 
who had mistakes on nearly every jump including falling twice. Abitbol 
and Bernadis took the pairs event making the fewer mistakes of the 
top couples. In the short program there was little to distinguish 
them because all skated clean. In the free program to the music of 
`Acropolis' they were off in individual jumps but had some unusual 
lifts to maintain first. Americans Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman moved 
from fourth to second with a program to the music from ``Phantom of 
the Opera.'' They scaled down a few triple moves and only had single 
axels at the end of their program. The Lalique Trophy is the fourth 
in the International Skating Union's that features Olympic-eligible 
skaters. Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event 
is the Cup of Russia in Moscow. The series culminates with the March 
final in Russia, two weeks before the world championships in Finland.
