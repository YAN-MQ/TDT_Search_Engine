Just as the United States has resolved a conflict with Iraq, another 
worry is entering the international agenda. U.S. military officials 
tell CNN north Korea is preparing to test launch its short and intermediate-range 
ballistic missiles, some of which have the capability of reaching 
parts of the United States. Andrea Koppel reports. Administration 
officials tell CNN, north Korea is now actively producing and marketing 
short-range missiles, specifically targeting exports at Iran, Libya, 
Syria and Pakistan. And administration officials also say north Korea 
is constructing at least two new launch sites for medium-range tae 
podong missiles, like the one launched last August. We have ongoing 
concerns about the dprk missile program. Not only is north Korea ignoring 
U.S. demands to halt production and exports of missiles, military 
sources also tell CNN the U.S. expects a Second launch of a medium-range 
tae podong missile, which is capable of reaching parts of Alaska and 
Hawaii "at any time." Missiles are something, that right now, neither 
the United States nor the japanese have the capability of defending 
against. And so that is a frightening concept. The first time north 
Korea launched the tae podong, it flew over japan, forcing Tokyo to 
reconsider a deal it signed along with the U.S. and south Korea in 
1994. That deal traded light water reactors and heavy fuel oil for 
north Korea's freezing of its nuclear weapons program. U.S. officials 
fear if north Korea launches another missile test, that could sound 
the death knell for the deal. The way the north Koreans are aggressively 
pursuing both the development of extended-range ballistic missiles 
and the export of those missiles, they are putting the agreed framework 
at risk politically. Administration sources tell CNN, because missiles 
are one of the only money-making commodities that famine-stricken 
north Korea has left, the U.S. had proposed lifting some of the economic 
sanctions currently in place. But according to one U.S. official, 
the north said, "we want cash," and the U.S. replied, "that's not 
gonna happen." Andrea Koppel, CNN, at the state department.
