Computermakers are doing more to make computers cheaper and simpler 
while meeting the needs of consumers. Marsha Walton has the story 
in today's "tech trends." The desktop computer has revolutionized 
the way we live, work and play. But attendees here at the comdex computer 
trade show say that box may not be with us forever. The PC as we know 
it probably is going away and where it's going is, it's going with 
us. High-tech analyst Cheryl currid says the PC's "smarts" are going 
to be in smaller hybrid devices. Palm-sized computers, phones that 
double as fax machines, scanners that can capture data from a page 
and beam it wirelessly to many other devices. The benefits of so many 
of these devices, you can be smart when you're not in front of your 
PC. Analysts say the computer has always been in sync with the needs 
of the corporate world. But far too often, the computer industry hasn't 
explored the needs of the average consumer. For the past 20 years, 
all we've done is bring digital technology to business. We are really 
are now is an industry starting to do now is take technology and move 
it to other devices and as a result bring it to the masses. For example, 
new devices like this web pad, looks a lot more like an etch-A-sketch 
than a computer. It's wireless, you can roam around the house with 
it, send E-mail and surf the net. But you won't find spreadsheets 
or word documents, it's made strictly for personal use. My moment 
is actually my inspiration. If my mom can't use it, we don't want 
to build it. For the 2,400 exhibitors here at comdex, the whole idea 
of computers is changing. We won't just sit in front of them anymore, 
we will wear them and carry them and let them start working for us.
