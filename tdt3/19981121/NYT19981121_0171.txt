A Brooklyn man died early Saturday after he and his wife jumped from 
a second-floor window while trying to escape a fire raging in their 
Crown Heights apartment. The man, Henry Brown, 58, died at Kings County 
Hospital Center shortly after jumping about 2:30 a.m. and suffering 
a trauma-induced heart attack, fire officials said. His wife, Eleanor, 
60, was in the hospital Saturday in extremely critical condition, 
suffering from second- and third-degree burns on her face, chest and 
arms, they said. Mrs. Brown's mother, Carrie Artis, 76, who was pulled 
from the building by firefighters, was also in critical condition 
at the hospital with similar burns, fire officials said. ``There was 
a heavy volume of fire coming out of there,'' said James Spollen, 
a Fire Department spokesman. ``The couple was lying in the street, 
and the mother was at the window. These people were in very bad shape.'' 
The blaze stunned neighbors who stood outside the family's home at 
254 Lincoln Rd., as firefighters desperately tried to resuscitate 
Brown and care for his wife, who is known in the community for her 
beautiful singing voice and her love of children. The couple ran a 
well-known private school for young children called the Kiddie Academy 
in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, a neighbor said, and 
they were active in community meetings on their block and at Baptist 
churches throughout the borough. One neighbor said that Mrs. Brown 
was a deacon in Bedford-Stuyvesant at the Concord Baptist Church, 
one of the largest black congregations in the city, and often sang 
gospel there. ``She would sing from her heart and had a beautiful 
religious voice,'' said the neighbor, Ruby Oliver, 77, who lives across 
the street from the Browns. ``It is really sad what has happened to 
her family. The flames inside, we all just stood out there last night 
and watched the firefighters. We didn't know what else to do.'' The 
fire at the otherwise unoccupied two-story brownstone started on the 
second floor shortly before 2:29 a.m. and quickly began to engulf 
the apartment, Spollen said. Firefighters arrived three minutes later, 
he said. Several began giving emergency medical attention to Brown 
and his wife outside the building, while another firefighter was taken 
up on a mechanized ladder and entered a window to retrieve Mrs. Brown's 
mother, he said. Sixty-two firefighters responded to the blaze, which 
fire investigators believe started when an electrical malfunction 
on the second floor ignited several cans of paint thinner. Although 
the fire was under investigation, fire officials said they did not 
think it was suspicious. It was under control within 30 minutes. Neighbors 
said that Mrs. Artis had come from the South to stay with her daughter, 
because her other daughter had been hospitalized with an illness in 
Brooklyn. Henry Brown's mother was also in the hospital, they added, 
and Mrs. Oliver noted that Brown had just visited his mother on Friday 
night, a few hours before the fire took his life and destroyed his 
home of three decades. Looking out of her window Saturday morning, 
Mrs. Oliver gazed at the ruin across the street. ``Last night, you 
could see the fire burning inside their home from here because the 
leaves have been falling,'' she said. ``Now it is all gone, gutted, 
charred completely through.''
