Now, a closer look at the sad situation in north Korea, where the 
full extent of the starvation and hardship is just now becoming clear 
to the western world. Our report tonight from NBC's John Palmer. In 
the past three years, north Korea has been ravaged by famine triggered 
by a collapsed economy and a cruel combination of drought and flooding. 
The government concedes that 1 million of its people have starved 
to death. U.N. experts think the real figure may be even higher. We 
estimate that between 800,000 and 3 million people may have died over 
the past three years from famine from malnutrition. This week, Ohio 
congressman Tony hall brought back pictures from his fourth trip to 
north Korea. He was shocked at what he saw, especially the children. 
One of the things you notice among the children is -- number one, 
they are stunted. They are stunted by the lack of food they are getting. 
I mean, it's a whole generation of kids who are stunted. You also 
notice that they have in their hair, a lot of their hair has fallen 
out and a lot of sores on their heads, which really denotes malnutrition. 
It's acute. And a good portion of this country is like that. It's 
overwhelming. The other thing that I noticed that was different this 
time than my past trips, I noticed a lot of gravestones that were 
on the hills -- I mean, hundreds and thousands of them. The United 
States is by far the largest contributor of food aid to north Korea, 
donating $172 million worth just this year. But the aid, coupled with 
efforts by the Clinton administration to open a Dialogue with north 
Korea, has had little effect the country's militant dictator, Kim 
Jong-il, who continues to spend heavily on military hardware while 
many of his people go hungry. Despite north Korea's recent provocations, 
the United States has quietly stepped up its food shipments of food 
in the continued hope of moderating north Korea's behavior. While 
administration officials routinely insist that food aid is decided 
on humanitarian grounds and is never used as a bargaining chip, they 
concede that without U.S. food shipments, north Korea would be near 
desperation. And that could have severe consequences for world peace.
