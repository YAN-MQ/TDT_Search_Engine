A new dispute is developing between Iraq and U.N. weapons inspectors. 
The inspectors are still on the job today, one week after Iraq promised 
to cooperate. But Iraqi officials are refusing to comply with chief 
weapons inspector richard Butler's request for several documents. 
Iraq calls the request "provocative rather than professional," and 
continues to insist on a comprehensive review of its weapons. We've 
said all along that the issue here is whether Iraq will meet its obligations 
under the security council resolutions, and whether UNSCOM is able 
to do its work. If we reach the conclusion that the answer to those 
questions is Negative, we obviously are prepared to act.
