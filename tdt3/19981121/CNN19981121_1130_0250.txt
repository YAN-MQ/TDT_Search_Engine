Mr. Clinton is refusing to discuss the ongoing impeachment hearings. 
He did say today he trusts lawmakers will "do the right thing in a 
Nonpolitical way." Two republican lawmakers see some hope for the 
president. Congressmen John Porter of Illinois and Peter king of New 
York say they'll refuse to support impeachment if it reaches the house 
floor. They also predict dozens, perhaps as many as 50, of their fellow 
GOP members will join them.
