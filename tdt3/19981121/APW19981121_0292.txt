Robert De Niro has told a French newspaper he is still angry about 
his questioning by a French judge investigating a prostitution ring, 
adding ``France's guests deserve to be treated better.'' In an interview 
published Saturday in the daily Le Figaro, De Niro denied he ever 
said he would give up his Legion of Honor award or that he would never 
return to France following his questioning. ``I simply said I was 
tempted to do that,'' De Niro was quoted as saying. ``Even today, 
I am still angry.'' He added: ``I am not the only visitor to France 
who has been mistreated.'' De Niro was hauled in for a day of questioning 
in February by a French judge as a witness in an international prostitution 
network. The actor denied paying any woman for sex, and angrily accused 
the judge of leading a ``witch hunt.'' De Niro was in Paris at the 
time for the filming of the movie ``Ronin,'' directed by John Frankenheimer, 
which is to be released in France next week. The trial of the prostitution 
ring's alleged leaders began last week and is expected to last until 
next Wednesday.
