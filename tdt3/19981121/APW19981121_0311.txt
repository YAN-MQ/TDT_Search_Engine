The federal prosecutors office in Karlsruhe on Saturday confirmed 
a new arrest warrant has been issued on Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish 
rebel leader who was arrested earlier this month in Rome, The confirmation 
came after Der Spiegel magazine reported Saturday that new charges 
against Ocalan, who was previously sought in Germany on a single charge 
of murder, included ``liquidation of a string of dissidents,'' in 
the 1980s, and ``a series of arson attacks in 1993.'' While federal 
prosecutor spokeswoman Eva Schuebel would not confirm the individual 
charges mentioned by the Hamburg-based Spiegel, she said she could 
confirm that a new arrest warrant with updated information ``was being 
forwarded to Bonn'' as a formality. Schuebel said that it did not 
automatically mean the Bonn Justice Ministry would decide on asking 
for Ocalan's extradition. On Friday, government spokesman Uwe-Karsten 
Heye told reporters that Germany has for now put off action on a 1990 
arrest warrant to allow Italian authorities to handle the case and 
because broader Turkish terrorism charges against Ocalan should have 
priority. Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport off a flight 
from Moscow and has asked for political asylum in Italy. A Rome court 
freed him from detention Friday but ordered him to remain in the capital. 
With 500,000 Kurds living here, Germany has a clear stake in Ocalan's 
fate. Already, thousands of Kurds have staged protests in Germany 
since his arrest. Germany banned Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, 
or PKK, in 1993 as an extremist organization after a series of terrorist 
attacks on Turkish and German targets, an extension of the rebels' 
14-year war for autonomy from Turkey. In 1996, Ocalan changed his 
strategy, renouncing violence in Germany in hopes of getting the ban 
on legal PKK activity lifted. Some 11,000 PKK activists are based 
in Germany despite the ban, according to the country's domestic security 
agency. Heye denied that fears of unrest in Germany influenced the 
government's decision. The case ``is in good hands'' in Italy, he 
said.
