Mike Cherry made news this week by not doing a thing. The New York 
Giants' third-string quarterback, Cherry was the only quarterback 
on the team not affected when the starter, Danny Kanell, was demoted 
last Wednesday and his backup, Kent Graham, was promoted. And yet, 
in the wake of that reversal, Cherry's relative anonymity ended. There 
was a nagging question raised by Fassel's decision to at least temporarily 
pull the plug on the Danny Kanell era, a question that could only 
have been asked in today's culture of the quarterback, the most debated, 
analyzed and singularly scrutinized position in sports. If Kanell 
isn't the team's quarterback of the future, then who is? Never mind 
that Kanell may still be the quarterback of the future. Enter Mike 
Cherry, the sixth-round choice in 1997 out of Murray State. Although 
Cherry will not play Sunday against the Eagles unless the game is 
a rout, he found himself a frequent focus of conversation this past 
week. Already considered the most physically gifted Giant quarterback, 
Cherry seems to have emerged as something of a people's choice. Even 
if few, including the coaches, really know what he can do once the 
huddle breaks. ``I'd like to get him in a game,'' Fassel said of Cherry 
on Friday. ``I'd like to see how he'd play and react, too. But how 
many teams find ways to get their third quarterback in the game?'' 
Fassel has bigger priorities. His team's last victory was five weeks 
ago. He's more worried about Kanell's confidence than Cherry's growth. 
And he'd like to rediscover the fearsome defense he lost somewhere 
along the way this season. But Fassel could make Cherry the second-string 
quarterback and use him as a second-half substitute, or even start 
him in one of the late-season games, especially if the Giants are 
only playing for first-round draft position. Evaluating Cherry might 
be valuable heading into next year's training camp, or next spring's 
draft, when the Giants might be in the market for a quarterback. Other 
young players, like wide receiver Joe Jurevicius, center Derek Engler, 
linebacker Ryan Phillips, and safety Shaun Williams, may receive limited 
tryouts Sunday. Cherry, meanwhile, politely waits his turn. A courtly, 
strapping, 24-year-old raised in Texarkana, Ark., he was worried last 
week about ruffling feathers or speaking out of turn. He has talked 
of wanting to support Graham and Kanell. But he has some big aspirations. 
``A lot of the guys give me a good razzing about my accent,'' Cherry 
said of his twang. ``I didn't know I had an accent. I guess I do. 
But you know what, Brett Favre is an old country boy, too. That's 
the way I think of myself. I'm a real simple guy, but I got plans 
and I can get things done.'' Cherry hasn't had an easy road to the 
National Football League. In Texarkana, which straddles the Arkansas 
and Texas border, his high school team ran the wing-T and threw the 
ball sparingly. Cherry still passed for 22 touchdowns. He went to 
the University of Arkansas, but after two years and a coaching change 
_ not to mention the installation of another run-based offense _ he 
decided to transfer. Division I-A programs like Texas, Southern Mississippi 
and Louisiana State made offers. But so did Murray State _ and because 
Murray State is in Division I-AA, Cherry would not have to sit out 
a season if he transferred. ``It was a big risk,'' Cherry said. ``But 
I wasn't thinking about making it to the pros, I was thinking about 
how I wanted to play where they threw the football and relied on the 
quarterback to make a lot of reads and decisions. ``I didn't care 
about whether I played on television or how many people were in the 
stands. I wanted to have fun playing football and that's why I went 
to Murray State. Turns out we won a lot, got on regional TV and the 
crowds tripled.'' But he wasn't selected until the sixth round _ probably 
because he came from a Division I-AA program, Rick Donohue, the Giants' 
assistant general manager, said. ``I don't think there's any question 
his skills are better than a sixth-rounder,'' Donohue said. ``We were 
fortunate if you consider his size and arm strength.'' At 6 feet 4 
inches and 225 pounds, Cherry has had the Giants wondering what the 
possibilities will be for him since he arrived in minicamp last spring. 
But while he has looked polished in practice, he has played little, 
even in preseason. This year, the Giants have had punter Brad Maynard 
and wide receiver Amani Toomer attempt passes, but not Cherry. ``I'm 
eager, but I'm patient,'' said Cherry, who will almost certainly play 
in the NFL's World League during the off season. ``I really feel like 
everything from college to the draft has worked out for the best.'' 
He said he spends two and one-half hours every night studying the 
Giants' playbook. ``It's been a childhood dream of mine to be a coach 
when I'm through here,'' Cherry said. ``And this is my chance to take 
full advantage of where I am right now. I'm like a doctor going to 
medical school and I'm at the top level.'' Fassel, a quarterback tutor, 
has good things to say about Cherry, though he has been measured in 
his praise of him this week _ in part, perhaps, because he wants to 
keep the focus on rebuilding Kanell's confidence. ``Mike knows the 
when and why of things and understands the concept of a play _ how 
a little change can affect the coverages or blitz pick-ups,'' Fassel 
said. ``There's a lot of progress in that.'' Cherry has not let the 
commotion surrounding the quarterback change _ and the attention it 
has brought him _ to turn his head too much. ``Just another week of 
work,'' he said. Besides, Mike Cherry is not even the most famous 
person in his family. His brother, Marty, is a model for several international 
clothing and eyeglass designers. Marty's face is regularly in full-page 
magazine and newspaper ads, something Mike Cherry is frequently reminded 
of inside the Giants' locker room. ``One of the guys will see Marty 
on the back of a newspaper and bring it over to me,'' Cherry said 
Friday. ``They'll say, `I guess we know who got all the good looks 
in your family.' ``Now what can I say to that?''
