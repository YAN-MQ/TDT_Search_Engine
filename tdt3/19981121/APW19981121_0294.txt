Austrian police have taken all precautions for the protection of U.S. 
facilities in Austria after a reported terrorist warning, a police 
official said Saturday. The U.S. State Department said Friday that 
the U.S. Embassy in Vienna had received credible information concerning 
the possibility of a terrorist act in the near future against American-affiliated 
facilities in Austria. In a similar press release, the U.S. Embassy 
in Vienna on Saturday said Austrian authorities had been informed 
``and are taking measures to maximize the security of those facilities 
and provide for public safety.'' It added, ``As noted in the Nov. 
12 Worldwide Caution Public Announcement, American citizens are reminded 
to maintain a high level of vigilance. This guidance is especially 
appropriate at this time in Austria. ``Organizers of any gathering 
in which large numbers of American citizens are participants shold 
ensure that appropriate security measures are taken or, where feasible, 
consider postponement.'' U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Hall told Austrian 
radio that the U.S. mission was continuing its work despite a ``credible 
threat.'' She was appreciative of the Austrian authorities' prompt 
and efficient response given to the U.S. security needs. Earlier, 
the Vienna police official, who did not give his name, said that Austrian 
police had ``no concrete indications'' of anti-U.S. plans in Austria. 
Nevertheless, the street on which the U.S. Embassy is located, has 
been permanently closed to traffic since Nov. 19, the official confirmed. 
He did not elaborate on other security measures taken except to refer 
to ``heightened surveillance'' of the embassy area.
