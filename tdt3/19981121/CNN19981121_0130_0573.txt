Attorney general Janet Reno says the federal government has broken 
up the largest immigrant smuggling ring in U.S. history. 31 people 
have been arrested. Officials say the ring made $220 million by smuggling 
7,000 people into the United States over the last three years. They 
say the organizers charged them $20,000 a person and then sold some 
of them into virtual slavery.
