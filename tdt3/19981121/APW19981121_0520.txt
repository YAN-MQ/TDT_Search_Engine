BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. experts inspected arms sites Saturday as 
an exchange of letters between Iraq and the United Nations suggested 
a new row was brewing over weapons documentation. At least four U.N. 
cars left the inspectors' Baghdad headquarters in the morning, but 
the spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission, Caroline Cross, said 
only: ``We are carrying on with our activities.'' It was the fourth 
consecutive day that the inspectors had gone into the field since 
they returned Tuesday from Bahrain, where they were evacuated after 
the United States threatened missile strikes. Iraq's National Monitoring 
Authority, which provides escorts for the UNSCOM teams, says the inspectors 
visited more than 23 sites in and around Baghdad from Wednesday through 
Friday. Meanwhile, it emerged that Iraq appeared to be reluctant to 
fulfill UNSCOM's latest request for documents, less than a week after 
the United States canceled its planned attack. The United States and 
Britain had intended to strike to force Baghdad to reverse its Oct. 
31 decision that halted all UNSCOM work. On Nov. 14, Iraq agreed to 
allow inspections to resume in a statement that pledged full cooperation 
with UNSCOM. UNSCOM chief Richard Butler promptly wrote to Baghdad 
asking it to hand over documents related to Iraq's chemical and biological 
programs. U.N. officials say that in reply, Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister 
Riyadh al-Qaisi has said Butler's request ``seems to be provocative 
rather than professional.'' In Seoul on Saturday, U.S. National Security 
Adviser Sandy Berger, said the United States believed Iraq was obliged 
to hand over the documents and would back Butler in his request. ``If 
we reach the conclusion that the answer to those questions is negative, 
we obviously are prepared to act,'' Berger said. Among other documents, 
Butler is said to be seeking an Iraqi air force diary that details 
munitions destroyed during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. The inspectors 
are charged with overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction, a process Baghdad must complete before the U.N. Security 
Council will lift the sweeping sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait. The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit the sale of 
oil and most trade _ have crippled Iraq's once-rich economy.
