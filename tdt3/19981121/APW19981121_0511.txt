Australian captain John Eales kicked four second-half penalties and 
rallied the Wallabies from a one-point halftime deficit to a 32-21 
victory over France on Saturday. Eales, who scored 15 points on his 
64th international appearance, made the most of repeated infringements 
from the French as Australia tightened its defense in the second half 
to win the first game of its two-match European tour _ and end the 
home side's eight-match winning streak. France and Australia displayed 
classy attacking play that augured well for both nations at next year's 
World Cup. In bitterly cold conditions at the Stade de France, Australia 
scored three tries to France's two in a brilliant first half. Three 
penalties from Christophe Lamaison, including a stunning 50-yard (meter) 
kick in the 10th minute, gave the French a 21-20 lead at the break. 
Daniel Wilson scored the first try of the match in the sixth minute, 
after brilliant work by Daniel Herbert. The Queensland center shimmied 
past three tackles before finding Joe Roff, whose pass set up Wilson 
for a comfortable try. Thomas Bowman scored the Wallabies' second 
try in the 13th minute, after collecting a long looping pass from 
Stephen Larkham. But France bounced back from the Australians' early 
domination to score two tries. In the 24th minute, winger Thomas Lombard 
put France ahead, shaking off a tackle from Stephen Larkham and sprinting 
40 yards (meters) to score. A classy lineout move gave France a 21-13 
lead in the 36th minute. Two meters from the line, Olivier Magne was 
first to the ball and then the French forwards drove over the line 
with Philippe Carbonneau scoring the try. But Toutai Kefu scored Australia's 
third first-half try in the 40th minute with another superb effort, 
charging 40 yards (meters) to score. Australia was weakened by the 
unavailability of seven of its top players for the 13-day European 
tour. Matt Burke, Ben Tune, Tim Horan, Damian Smith and Dan Crowley 
were among the absentees. Australia had won both the countries' recent 
meetings, 29-15 in Sydney and 26-19 in Brisbane last year. ___ Lineups
