Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Saturday harshly warned Italy 
against granting political asylum to a Kurdish rebel leader wanted 
on terrorism charges in Turkey. Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If 
it does, Turkey will not leave this unanswered,'' Yilmaz said. On 
Friday, an Italian court rejected a Turkish warrant for the arrest 
of Abdullah Ocalan under a law barring extradition to countries where 
suspects faces the death penalty. The court also said he could be 
freed from custody. Turkey said it would appeal. ``I have a few words 
to say to our friend and ally Italy,'' Yilmaz said at a convention 
of his center-right Motherland Party. ``Italy's biggest error would 
be to open its arms to the bloodiest terrorist in the world.'' Ocalan 
leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a 14-year-old 
war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey that has claimed 37,000 
lives. He is on trial in absentia in Turkey on capital charges. Ocalan 
was in custody in a hospital outside Rome and it was not clear when 
he'd be set free. The court ordered him to stay in the Italian capital, 
but that restriction could be lifted next month. The Turkish newspaper 
Hurriyet said Saturday that Libya might offer him refuge if he leaves 
Italy. In Germany, a prosecutor in Karlsruhe said Saturday that a 
new arrest warrant had been issued for Ocalan. It reportedly accuses 
him of murdering PKK dissidents and a series of arson attacks. It 
is now up to the Justice Ministry to decide whether to seek his extradition. 
Just a day earlier, it announced that Germany would not pursue Ocalan's 
extradition on an earlier warrant. Anti-Italian sentiment was again 
running high in Turkey on Saturday after the decision to free Ocalan. 
Outraged Turks laid black wreaths in front of the Italian Embassy 
and honked their horns. Graffiti denouncing the PKK defaced the walls. 
``No to terrorism, today and forever'' read a banner hung across the 
boulevard in front of the embassy. Turkish businesses, 9th graf pvs
