U.S. military officials have another concern about the Korean peninsula. 
One which they tell CNN they are monitoring closely. Secretary of 
state Madeleine Albright says relations with north Korea are at a 
critical juncture. Andrea Koppel has the story. Administration officials 
tell CNN north Korea is now actively producing and marketing short-range 
missiles, specifically targeting exports at Iran, Libya, Syria and 
Pakistan. And administration officials also say north Korea is constructing 
at least two new launch sites for medium-range tae podong missiles 
like the one launched last August. We have ongoing concerns about 
the north Korean missile program. But so far, not only is north Korea 
ignoring U.S. demands to halt production and exports of missiles, 
military sources also tell CNN the U.S. expects a second launch of 
a medium-range tae podong missile, which has a Capability of reaching 
parts of Alaska and Hawaii "at any time." Missiles are something that 
right now that neither the U.S. nor the japanese have the capability 
of defending against, so that is a frightening concept. The first 
time north Korea launched the tae podong, it flew over japan, forcing 
Tokyo to reconsider a deal it signed along with the U.S. and south 
Korea in 1994. That deal traded light-water reactors and heavy fuel 
oil for north Korea's freezing of its nuclear weapons program. U.S. 
officials fear if north Korea launches another missile test, that 
could sound the death knell for the deal. Administration sources tell 
CNN because missiles are one of the only moneymaking commodities famine-stricken 
north Korea has left, the U.S. has proposed lifting some economic 
sanctions currently in place. But according to one U.S. official, 
the north is saying, "we want cash." The us is saying, "that's not 
going to happen." Andrea Koppel, CNN, at the state department.
