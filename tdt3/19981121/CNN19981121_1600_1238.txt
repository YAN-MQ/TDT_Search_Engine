Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." The daunting Michigan defense 
had to give out eventually and today was the day. In Columbus, Ohio 
state controlled the game from beginning to end. Joe germaine threw 
three TDs, two to David Boston, while Michael Wylie ran for a score 
as well in the 31-16 win. The buckeyes snap an eight-game losing streak 
to Michigan. Ohio state will go to the rose bowl if Penn state can 
beat Wisconsin. 0,000 at the rose bowl, UCLA goes for its eight consecutive 
win over rival usc. The Bruins are also undefeated. Florida at Florida 
state. A fight broke out between the two teams before the game, and 
Florida starting defensive back, Tony George, was ejected before the 
game even began. That's a big loss. There's Ohio state's big win. 
Arkansas at Mississippi state. And notre dame playing LSU, wraps up 
a look at Saturday's top ten.
