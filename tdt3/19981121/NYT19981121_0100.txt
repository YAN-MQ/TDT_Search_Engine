Four years after the car-bombing of a Jewish community center here 
that left 86 dead, Argentine officials say they are hopeful that the 
detention of a potentially crucial witness in Brazil this week will 
finally lead to a breakthrough in the case. The investigations into 
the bombing of the Israeli Embassy here in 1992, which left 28 dead, 
and the bombing of the community center, the Argentine Israeli Mutual 
Association, two years later have sputtered for years despite many 
tantalizing leads. Two Argentine prosecutors flew to Brazil on Thursday 
to interview Wilson Dos Santos, a 40-year-old resident of Sao Paulo, 
who had walked into the Argentine, Israeli and Brazilian consulates 
in Milan, Italy, two weeks before the bombing to warn officials of 
an impending terrorist attack in Buenos Aires. Officials paid no attention 
to the warning at the time. Dos Santos added new details to his account 
in interviews with the Argentine federal police four months after 
the attack, only to recant everything before a federal judge the following 
week. Then he disappeared, until the police in Sao Paulo detained 
him for possible extradition to Argentina. For years, Argentine law-enforcement 
officials had requested that Brazil help them locate Dos Santos. It 
is not yet clear whether Dos Santos was in hiding or what he had been 
doing the last few years. Brazilian and Argentine officials said he 
was not under arrest.
