In the days since British Columbia became the first Canadian province 
to file a lawsuit to recover medical costs from tobacco companies, 
Penny Priddy, the province's health minister, has been traveling across 
Canada looking for allies. Taking her cue from the United States, 
where the joint legal action by several states has led to a $206-billion 
tentative settlement with the tobacco industry, Ms. Priddy has talked 
to other provincial health officials about joining the suit, which 
was filed Nov. 12. But so far she has received little more than encouraging 
words. Ms. Priddy said that part of the reason for the reluctance 
of the other provinces to take on the powerful Canadian tobacco industry 
and the U.S. parent companies of the cigarette producers may be the 
objections of local tobacco growers. Tobacco is not an important crop 
in British Columbia. Another reason appears to be an aspect of Canadian 
law that makes it possible for the tobacco companies to recover legal 
costs if the province's suit fails. In Canada, the tobacco companies 
are fighting back. Minutes after the province filed its suit, the 
cigarette manufacturers filed their own suit. They are challenging 
the constitutionality of the British Columbia law, which reverses 
the normal legal precedent that would require the province to prove 
its allegations. Instead, the law forces the companies to prove that 
cigarettes are not addictive or harmful. The province's lawsuit is 
``a kind of political ploy on the part of an unpopular government 
to demonize an unpopular industry,'' said Robert Parker, president 
of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Association, which is also 
named in the British Columbia suit. ``It amounts to state-sponsored 
extortion because they believe the industry will pay anything it takes'' 
to be allowed to stay in business. British Columbia has some of the 
toughest anti-smoking laws in Canada. A new provincial law requires 
tobacco companies to disclose the ingredients in their cigarettes. 
And the tobacco industry as a whole will have to pay almost $14 million 
a year for a license to do business in British Columbia. Prices would 
be controlled so the companies cannot pass along the additional costs 
to consumers. In addition to the tough laws, the province decided 
to sue the tobacco companies for the costs of treating smokers who 
become ill. Ms. Priddy estimates that it cost the province about $345 
million a year to treat tobacco-related illnesses. Ms. Priddy, a former 
nurse, did not challenge the tobacco companies' assertion that the 
lawsuit is an attempt by the province to raise money. ``The lawsuit 
is only part of a broader strategy in British Columbia to protect 
kids against tobacco, to recover health care costs and to recover 
some dollars to allow us to do really good prevention and cessation 
activities,'' Ms. Priddy said in an interview in Toronto, which she 
visited to find support for the British Columbia suit.
