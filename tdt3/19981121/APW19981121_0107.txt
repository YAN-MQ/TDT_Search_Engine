Progress finally occurred in NBA labor talks, with players and owners 
making several compromises during the longest negotiation session 
of the 143-day lockout. ``I would say there has been some movement 
from both sides,'' commissioner David Stern said after about 9 1/2 
hours of meetings ended shortly before 0400 GMT Saturday morning. 
``I think it's fair to say that there's an evident spirit of an attempt 
to reach (agreement) on both sides.'' The sides will not meet again 
during the weekend, and no firm date was set for resuming discussions 
next week. But both sides agreed a resumption should be expected before 
November 26. ``You reach a point in negotiations when you have to 
take a breather, and we both felt that we kind of reached that point,'' 
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``We all want to have turkey 
with our families if we can, but other than that we realize that making 
the deal as soon as we can is more important than any other obligations 
we have.'' Stern tempered his enthusiasm by pointing out that the 
sides remain far apart on many issues, but his comments were both 
surprisingly optimistic and clearly indicative there was real progress 
in trying to settle the most damaging labor dispute in league history. 
In a lockout, owner of teams prevent the players from playing until 
a labor agreement is reached. While lockouts have happened before 
in the National Basketball Association, it is the first time one has 
prevented the start of the regular basketball season. So far, the 
first month and a half of the season has been canceled, and an agreement 
would need to be reached in the next week or so in order to start 
before Christmas. Such a scenario seemed highly unlikely when the 
sides arrived spouting pessimism in the morning, but as the clock 
neared midnight it no longer seemed as far-fetched. ``We reached a 
position where neither side was prepared to make any further movement, 
so we though it was a good time to stop,'' union director Billy Hunter 
said. ``When you've been in a hotel for 12 or 14 hours, the air gets 
stale and your head gets cloudy.'' Sources involved in the talks, 
speaking on the condition they not be identified, told The Associated 
Press each side had moved about a couple points off its desired salary 
percentages. The owners had been demanding 50 percent, while the players 
wanted 60. If the percentage of revenues devoted to salaries failed 
to drop below an agreed-upon level _ and what that level would be 
is one of the biggest points of contention _ most players would contribute 
up to 10 percent of their salaries into an escrow fund, with the money 
going back to the owners if the designated percentage was exceeded.
