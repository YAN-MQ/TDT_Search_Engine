Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Saturday harshly warned Italy 
against granting political asylum to a Kurdish rebel leader freed 
by an Italian court. Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If it does, 
Turkey will not leave this unanswered,'' Yilmaz said. On Friday, an 
Italian court rejected a Turkish warrant for the arrest of Abdullah 
Ocalan under a law barring extradition to countries where suspects 
faces the death penalty. Turkey said it would appeal. Ocalan was being 
held in a hospital outside Rome and it was not clear when he'd be 
set free. The court ordered him to stay in Rome, but that restriction 
could be lifted next month. The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet said Saturday 
that Libya might offer him refuge if leaves Italy. ``I have a few 
words to say to our friend and ally Italy,'' Yilmaz said at a convention 
of his center-right Motherland Party. ``Italy's biggest error would 
be to open its arms to the bloodiest terrorist in the world.'' Ocalan 
leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a 14-year-old 
war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey that has claimed 37,000 
lives. He is on trial in absentia in Turkey on capital charges. Laying 
black wreaths and honking horns in front of the Italian embassy, Turks 
showed their outrage Saturday at the Italian court's decision. ``No 
to terrorism, today and forever'' read a banner hung across a main 
boulevard where the embassy is located while loud speakers blared 
patriotic songs. The embassy walls were sprayed with graffiti denouncing 
the PKK. Turkish businesses were boycotting Italian products and a 
newspaper said the government canceled the purchase of five Italian 
Agusta helicopters. The Turkish subsidiary of the Italian clothing 
company Benetton said it would drape black cloth over the windows 
of its 171 outlets in Turkey in protest against. In Rome, the Foreign 
Ministry advised Italians to put off trips to Turkey as a precaution. 
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema warned Turkey risked distancing itself 
from the rest of Europe with its harshness toward Italy. ``Our aim 
is to be a bridge between Turkey and Europe,'' he said in an interview 
with the Turkish newspaper Sabah published Saturday. Other European 
countries have tried to stay out of the dispute, but the United States 
has been pushing Italy to extradite Ocalan. The Washington-based Human 
Rights Watch on Saturday said it supports Italy's decision not to 
extradite Ocalan to Turkey, but added that he should be ``held accountable 
for atrocities committed under his leadership.''
