Palestinian police celebrated Friday as Israel withdrew troops from 
parts of the northern West Bank. There were small skirmishes. No injuries 
are reported. The move gives Palestinians full or partial control 
over an additional 9% of the disputed area. Israeli troops left an 
army base near the Palestinian town of jenin. In accordance with the 
recent Middle East peace accord, Israel is scheduled to carry out 
two more pullbacks by late January.
