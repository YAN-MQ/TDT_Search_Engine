Some 35 cardboard boxes, many already sagging under their own weight, 
are piled high against a wall outside the coach's office on the second 
floor of the Berto Center, the Chicago Bulls' training facility. They 
have occupied that spot for nearly four months, and belong to a man 
who is, more or less, neither here nor there. He is Tim Floyd, Basketball's 
Man Without a Definite Capacity. He is either the new coach of the 
world champion Chicago Bulls and successor to Phil Jackson, or he 
is not. He is either the team's director of basketball operations, 
a new Bulls designation, or he is not. He is either their new sweeper 
of the equipment room, or he is not. ``When I signed my contract in 
July with the Bulls,'' Floyd said, sitting not in the coach's office, 
nor in the office of the director of basketball operations _ for there 
is none _ but in a small conference room, ``I said I'd do anything 
they wanted me to do. If it was to coach the team, or scout, or look 
at films, or even sweep out the equipment room, I'd do it. I'd do 
whatever made people comfortable.'' By ``people,'' he meant Michael 
Jordan. ``I don't want to be the person who is said to have driven 
the greatest player to ever play the game out of the game,'' Floyd 
said. This was a monumental concern before he took the job _ rather, 
a job _ and is still a kind of Damocles' sword over Floyd's 44-year-old 
neck. After all, Jordan had said last season that he would play for 
no other coach than Jackson. He has hedged on that, but a question 
remains: Would he play, at this point in his career, for someone with 
no professional experience as either a player or coach? And while 
Floyd has not unpacked and moved into Jackson's old office _ it doesn't 
seem appropriate to him, sensitive to the faint sliver of possibility 
that he may not be the coach _ he does spend 16 to 18 hours a day 
in the dark of a film room studying the triangle offense and the octopus-like 
defense that have helped make the Bulls so successful. He has studied 
opposition strategies and player tendencies, and sought to understand 
why timeouts were called when they were, why substitutions were made 
when they were. And he has sought like enlightenment from assistant 
coaches and others in the organization. ``I want to be ready for whatever 
happens,'' Floyd said. ``I want to be ready to contribute to the organization. 
What we do is prepare for Plan A _ with all the players back _ and 
Plan B, if not all of the players return.'' Hard Work and Politics 
Mark His Entrance Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, was first 
impressed with Floyd 10 years ago when Floyd was the coach at the 
University of New Orleans and ``beating teams his level of personnel 
had no business beating.'' Krause said about Floyd's work ethic around 
the Berto Center, ``No one comes in earlier, and no one leaves later.'' 
And as the lockout continues, with 10 free agents _ including Jordan, 
Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, the heart of the title team _ among 
last season's 14 roster players, there is also a great deal of posturing 
and politicking, subtle and overt, involving the team. Politics with 
the Bulls is the basketball equivalent of what transpired in the Byzantine 
Empire. After winning six championships in eight years, Jackson decided 
to resign as coach. Some felt he was pushed by Krause, though Jackson 
has denied that, saying that though he and Krause had a falling out, 
the team's owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, had steadfastly but without success 
sought Jackson's return for at least another season. Whereupon, Jordan 
said he would not play for any other coach. Jordan now says that he 
has not decided, and will do so only after the owners' lockout of 
the players is settled. Jordan did, however, give the impression early 
on that he would not play for Floyd, who had been courted by Krause 
to, it was obvious, replace Jackson. And the impression spread that 
Floyd was not just a fishing buddy of Krause's _ they had made a couple 
of fishing trips together _ but that he was Krause's ``boy,'' as the 
saying went. Floyd, the head coach at Iowa State for the last four 
years, saw a challenge with the Bulls and wanted to join the organization 
_ ``I know that if I went there, sooner or later I'd be coaching there,'' 
he said _ but didn't want to do anything Jordan didn't want him to. 
Floyd knew that if he did anything to displease His Airness, he would 
be vilified in Chicago and perhaps nationally _ possibly internationally 
_ and castigated and berated, hurdles that even a highly confident, 
idealistic and still rather boyish-looking coach might not be able 
to overcome. Floyd got into coaching because, he said, ``as a basketball 
player I was terrible.'' He was a walk-on at Southern Mississippi, 
the school where his father, Lee, had been head basketball coach until 
his death in 1971, when Tim was a high school senior. After spending 
time on the bench there for two years, Floyd transferred to Louisiana 
Tech. In his junior year, he was told by Coach Emmett Hendricks, ``I 
think your future is in coaching.'' He made Floyd a student assistant 
coach. Upon Floyd's graduation, Don Haskins of the University of Texas 
at El Paso hired him as an assistant coach. Floyd stayed there for 
nine years, before becoming head coach at Idaho for two years, New 
Orleans for six and then Iowa State. He compiled a 243-130 record 
in 12 years as a college head coach, taking his teams to five NCAA 
tournaments and two NIT tournaments. ``The first word that comes to 
mind about him as a coach,'' Iowa State Athletic Director Gene Smith 
said of the 6-foot-2-inch, 200-pound Floyd, ``is `intense.' He's always 
mentally into the game, and I think the players drew from that. When 
the game started, he'd take off his sport jacket and throw it to the 
end of the bench. He'd loosen his tie, and he'd prowl the sidelines, 
a program rolled up in his fist. He had a game face, and he produced.'' 
Fred Hoiberg, now with the Indiana Pacers, played his senior year 
for Floyd at Iowa State. ``Tim took over for a legend, Johnny Orr, 
but from Day One he let us know who was boss,'' Hoiberg said. ``He 
can be a yeller, but he does it for a purpose. He's actually calm, 
though, especially with X's and O's under pressure. Everyone I know 
who has played for him has respected him.'' Floyd married his college 
sweetheart, Beverly, and they have one daughter, Shannon, a high school 
senior in Ames, Iowa. Wife and daughter will join Floyd in Chicago 
when Shannon graduates next spring. While Shannon concerns herself 
with grades, her father concerns himself with making the grade. And 
making Jordan feel comfortable. Since there was a lockout and management 
_ apparently even potential management _ was prohibited from speaking 
to the players, Floyd, before deciding to take the Bulls' job, used 
intermediaries to feel Jordan out. Sounding Out Jordan With Well-Placed 
Calls He called two friends in the coaching fraternity, Buzz Peterson, 
the head coach of Appalachian State and a former teammate of Jordan's 
at North Carolina, and Roy Williams, head coach of Kansas and an assistant 
when Jordan played for the Tar Heels in the early 1980s. Williams 
and Peterson told Jordan essentially the same thing: ``Tim doesn't 
want to do anything that is even close to running you off.'' Williams 
recalled recently that he spoke to Jordan and told him that Floyd 
``was a good guy, interested in basketball and not a puppet for management, 
a coach concerned about his players.'' And as Williams related, Jordan 
told both of his old friends: ``I have no problem with him. He has 
to do what he has to do, and I have to do what I have to do. Time 
will tell.'' Jordan added, however, ``Tell him that if he wants the 
job, he should take it if it is offered.'' So, said Floyd, ``I felt 
that Jordan might feel comfortable about my being here, and it wouldn't 
affect his decision to return.'' But Floyd still seemed concerned 
with Jordan's comfort level. He wanted to speak to Jackson, regarding 
two points. One was: what could Floyd learn from him about the Bulls' 
playing system? The other was this: ``If Phil in any way harbored 
a desire to return, I was more than willing to step aside. Whatever 
were his wishes.'' When Floyd accepted the new position as director 
of basketball operations at a salary of close to $8 million for five 
years, he did so at a news conference on July 23 in which Reinsdorf 
stated that he was still hoping Jackson would return. Jackson, from 
his home in Montana, viewed this cynically at the time. ``I didn't 
know I'd have to retire a second time,'' he said. It was a strange 
situation, most of it designed to placate Jordan _ if, in fact, he 
even needed placating. No one was quite sure. Least of all Floyd. 
One of the first things he did was seek to keep Jackson's _ and, in 
a sense, Jordan's _ assistant coaches, Frank Hamblen, Bill Cartwright 
and Tex Winter. Especially Winter, the creator of the vaunted triangle 
offense. ``He said he felt it was very important that I stay on the 
bench with him,'' Winter said. ``He made it clear that he didn't want 
to change anything. `If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' was his attitude.'' 
Floyd had expressed interest to Winter in meeting Jackson one day. 
``Phil was in town and I had had dinner with him and asked if he'd 
like to meet Tim,'' Winter said. ``Phil said, `Why, fine, certainly. 
I'd like to talk to Tim.''' The two first talked on the phone. ``We 
talked for about an hour and a half, about what he did and why he 
did it,'' Floyd said. ``I took notes the whole time.'' Sometime after 
that, Floyd visited Jackson at the suburban Chicago house in which 
Jackson was living. ``It was a good chat,'' Floyd said. He did not 
want to reveal particulars, nor has Jackson, who declined to be interviewed 
for this article. ``They were very compatible,'' Winter said. ``I 
knew they would be. They're both fine guys. Good men. Both outstanding 
coaches and very thorough. I'm sure Tim will do an excellent job as 
a head coach in the pros. I'm just worried that the press will give 
him a fair shake. I think so far they have.'' Williams said he was 
also worried for Floyd's sake. ``I told him,'' Williams said, ``that 
he may be going into a hornet's nest. He said, `I like the challenge.' 
Of course, Jackson won with exceptional talent. If that talent isn't 
there, well, the expectations may or may not still be there.'' The 
Players Weigh In Steve Kerr, the guard and one of the Bulls' free 
agents, said: ``From what I hear, Floyd is doing all the right things, 
saying all the right things. He's smart. He should do OK'' Pippen, 
who last December said he would never play for the Bulls again, and 
did, said recently that Jackson's departure ``depletes my enthusiasm'' 
to return to the Bulls ``to a great degree.'' But the jury is still 
out on him. And Jordan said recently: ``I have no problem with anything 
Tim Floyd has done. I didn't know that he saw Phil _ it's the first 
I've heard of it. But are you asking whether that will influence my 
decision to return? The answer is no.'' And Floyd recalls what Rodman 
had said when it was learned that Floyd, a college coach, might succeed 
Jackson: ``He said, `It's a joke.''' The Bulls' director of basketball 
operations _ he still has not been named head coach _ smiled ruefully. 
``I just took his statements as loyalty to Phil _ same as Michael,'' 
he said. ``I admire that. I can only hope that when all is said and 
done, they'd all feel good about me if I got an opportunity to coach 
them. ``I don't know what's in store,'' Floyd added. ``Everything 
is still kind of up in the air.'' Including, as usual, Jordan, the 
essential star in the Chicago firmament. In fact, Floyd would reveal 
only one piece of advice that Jackson offered. ``It would probably 
really help you if Michael came back,'' Jackson said, straight-faced.
