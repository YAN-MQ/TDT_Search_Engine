The country's trade unions on Saturday seized the international spotlight 
on government plans to take over white-owned farms, raising questions 
about the fate of 60,000 black farm workers who could lose their jobs. 
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trades Unions said it would investigate what 
would happen to the workers if the government resettles thousands 
of landless blacks onto more than 800 farms, as it threatened once 
again last week to do. International donors are closely watching the 
proposed seizure that would violate promises made by President Robert 
Mugabe that he would hold off on the takeovers. ``The ZCTU has never 
opposed the land reform policy in broad terms,'' said secretary general 
Morgan Tsvangirai. ``But we must get the facts as far as this is concerned.'' 
Mugabe's intended land seizure is seen as an attempt to cultivate 
support in the country at a time that unrest over soaring prices and 
government corruption present the most serious threat ever to his 
18-year-old governance. Mugabe and his family left unexpectedly on 
Friday for a 16-day overseas trip to Egypt, Libya, France, Italy and 
Britain, without the customary formal announcement in the government 
gazette. No reason was given for the trip. Following two one-day strikes 
over the past two weeks that shut down the economy, the ZCTU said 
it would submit its strongest demands to date to the government on 
Monday, part of a platform adopted by its national executive panel 
on Saturday. It plans to push for an increase in power for Parliament, 
a reduction in the number of costly cabinet members from 54 to 15, 
and a refund of billions of Zimbabwe dollars (millions of U.S. dollars) 
that politicians have bilked from housing and pension funds. Until 
now, the unions have restricted their demands to wage matters, pushing 
for increased salaries and reduced prices to counteract soaring inflation. 
Tsvangirai said the unions would also demand a full statement of the 
cost of Zimbabwe's current war effort in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, where over 8,000 troops are backing President Laurent Kabila. 
The labor leader called for a social contract to address poverty alleviation 
to be discussed at the ongoing talks between labor, business and government 
that is next to meet on Nov. 30. The United Nations says 60 percent 
of Zimbabwe's 12.7 million people live below the poverty line.
