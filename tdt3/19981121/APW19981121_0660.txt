Though no one has yet been stung by an Africanized bee on St. Croix, 
Department of Agriculture officials are warning residents to stay 
away from colonies of the excitable insects. The aggressive bees, 
sometimes called ``killer bees,'' have been present on the island 
since 1994, but have spread further afield in search of food since 
Hurricane Georges blew away fruit blossoms and flowering plants. ``We 
have had a number of reports from concerned citizens and the department 
has assisted some individuals to remove colonies from their premises,'' 
said Errol Chichester, a department of agriculture extension officer. 
``Bee activity increases at this time of year,'' said Agriculture 
Commissioner Dr. Arthur Petersen. He said his main concern is that 
children out of school for holiday vacation might mix with the bees. 
``What we want to do is alert the public about the steps to take if 
confronted with an attack,'' said Petersen. ``To put it simply, run 
for cover as far and as fast as you can.'' Dr. Jeff Keularts, an entomologist 
at the University of the Virgin Islands, endorsed that advice. ``Anything 
or anybody that's in the vicinity will be attacked,'' he said. ``If 
it's an Africanized colony they will attack in larger numbers. Ten 
percent of the colony can be recruited.'' Keularts said a small colony 
can have as few as 15,000 bees, but a large, well established colony 
can have as many as 75,000. In nearby Puerto Rico, a 2-year-old boy 
died hours after he was attacked by a swarm of the bees earlier this 
summer.
