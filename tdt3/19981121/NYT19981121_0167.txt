With a deal reported to be near for the sale of the New York Yankees, 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, their No. 1 fan, was uncharacteristically 
reticent Saturday about what that might mean for the team and its 
possible move from the Bronx. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner is 
close to an agreement to sell a majority share in the team to Cablevision 
but with a proviso keeping him in charge, several of his business 
associates have said. With Steinbrenner's history of complaints about 
Yankee Stadium and the threat of New Jersey's luring the team away, 
the mayor has made the team's retention a top priority, even if that 
means building a new ball park at city expense in midtown Manhattan. 
Such a move is opposed by critics like City Council Speaker Peter 
Vallone. At a news conference a few blocks from Yankee Stadium, the 
mayor did not deny the prospective deal, nor would he say anything 
about it. ``That isn't for me to comment on,'' Giuliani said. ``That's 
a private deal. It's a private organization. The Yankees, despite 
some of the misconceptions among some of the politicians in this city, 
are a private business, and whatever they do in terms of sales is 
really their business.'' Asked how a sale might affect the Yankees' 
future, the mayor was equally noncommittal. ``I have no idea,'' he 
said. ``It would depend on who they sold it to, what their resources 
were. I mean, we'll only know that if there is a sale of the Yankees.'' 
And asked if an impending sale would expedite a decision on a new 
stadium and site, the mayor only said, ``There's no way to know that.'' 
But Giuliani did talk about a related issue: the recent decision of 
the city's Economic Development Corp. to pay $3 million for design 
studies for a new stadium in the Bronx or Manhattan, which The New 
York Daily News reported Friday. Vallone, who has vowed to block a 
new stadium outside the Bronx, attacked the design project. The mayor's 
comments came as a limited partner in the Yankees said that the potential 
sale was the central item on the agenda at a partners' meeting on 
Thursday in Cleveland. ``We had a very good lunch,'' said the partner, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity because Steinbrenner had issued 
strict orders not to talk to the press. A business associate of Steinbrenner's 
said that it was unlikely he would decide on a future home for the 
Yankees in the Bronx, Manhattan or New Jersey before the sale was 
completed, possibly early next year.
