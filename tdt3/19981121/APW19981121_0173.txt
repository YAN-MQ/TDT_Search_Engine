Belgian police, helping Dutch detectives hunt for the attackers of 
the wife of Royal Philips Electronics President Cor Boonstra, have 
searched houses in and around the northern city of Antwerp, Dutch 
media reported Saturday. Hansje Boonstra-Raatjes, 62, was kidnapped, 
brutally beaten, handcuffed, strangled and left for dead in a deserted 
car park in the western Dutch town of Hoek van Holland last Friday. 
Boonstra-Raatjes, suffered a broken arm, broken fingers, a serious 
head injury and was nearly blinded in the attack. She was able to 
speak to Dutch investigators for the first time late Friday, according 
to newspaper reports Saturday. Boonstra-Raatjes, who remains in a 
Hague hospital in stable condition, reportedly told police that she 
was bundled into a car in the northern Dutch city of Antwerp, close 
to the Dutch border. Police have described the attack as a ``deliberate 
payback,'' but refuse to elaborate. The Dutch detectives pinpointed 
at least three houses to be searched by Belgian colleagues based on 
evidence collected in the week since the attack, including finger 
prints found on Boonstra-Raatjes' BMW, Dutch daily De Telegraaf reported. 
No arrests were immediately reported. Boonstra-Raatjes, who is separated 
from her husband, divides her time between luxury homes in Belgium 
and the Bahamas.
