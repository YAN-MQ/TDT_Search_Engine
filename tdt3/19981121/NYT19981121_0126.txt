Denver did not disappear in an apocalyptic earthquake on Oct. 10, 
as predicted by a Christian sect leader. But now he has disappeared 
with about 75 followers and their children. Leading up to Denver's 
date with destiny, members of the sect, Concerned Christians, sold 
their cars, furniture and houses. They told relatives of vague plans 
to travel abroad, probably to Israel, with their leader, Monte Kim 
Miller. About 10 of the missing followers were found this week in 
Israel, said Brig. Gen. Hezi Leder, the police attache at the Israeli 
Embassy in Washington, on Friday evening. The list of located Americans 
did not include Miller, who has prophesied that he will be killed 
in the streets of Jerusalem in December 1999, setting off an apocalyptic 
end to the millennium. ``We are very concerned about people worried 
about the end of the millennium coming to Israel and trying to do 
something,'' Leder said. ``If there is any evidence that they intend 
to commit a crime, we intend to prevent them from coming into Israel.'' 
Already about 100 American Christians, none of them related to Miller's 
group, have moved this year to the Mount of Olives section of Jerusalem 
to await the end of the millennium, said one expert on the phenomenon, 
Brenda Brasher, a religion professor at Mount Union College in Ohio. 
Referring to the Concerned Christians group, she said, ``I would be 
very surprised if this is the only one that takes such an act _ dropping 
out, severing all ties and heading to Israel.'' In Denver, Miller, 
a charismatic 6-foot-5-inch former marketing executive for Procter 
&AMP; Gamble, was known for speaking in what he said was the voice 
of God. ``He said, `I will have to let God answer that,' '' Bill Honsberger, 
a Baptist pastor, recalled Friday of an encounter he had here with 
Miller two years ago. ``He shifted his position in his chair, contorted 
his face and opened his mouth _ and it was `God.' He kept threatening 
us, making it clear that God is going to kill us. ``One member was 
in the room and he became enraptured,'' continued Honsberger, who 
has warned Christian radio stations about Miller's violent prophecies. 
In the mid-1980s, Miller spoke out against cults in Denver churches. 
But, more recently, he seemed to have adopted some of the practices 
he once preached against. As his preachings became increasingly apocalyptic, 
he mailed letters to Denver churches, accusing them of ``Satanic'' 
preaching. ``The Lord's grace has been with the church for 2,000 years; 
his judgments are ready to begin,'' Miller told a Denver television 
station, KUSA-TV, two years ago. ``He died on the cross for our sins. 
Now we're to go to our deaths as well.'' Miller wants his followers 
to be in Jerusalem, because according to his teachings, the world 
will end at the end of next year. Only he and his followers will be 
saved in Jerusalem. At the same time, Miller appeared to secure strong 
control of his followers. His followers appeared to support him financially 
after he sought bankruptcy protection a year ago, in the face of $600,000 
in debts. ``Kim has such control over this group,'' said Honsberger, 
who has talked to many concerned relatives of members. ``They telephone 
and ask him: `Can we go to the movies tonight? Should I talk to my 
mother? Should I wear the blue outfit or the green outfit?' '' Calls 
to Miller's abandoned home here, which had served as the group's headquarters, 
are taken by an answering machine. During the summer, when members 
were getting passports in preparation for leaving the country, Miller 
arranged for three brothers who are members to marry three single 
women in the group, said Mark Roggeman, a Denver police officer who 
studies the group when he is off duty. In the only known incident 
when the sect conduct escalated above the level of death threats, 
John Weaver, a retired police officer, recalls that a church member 
armed with a pistol banged on his door three years ago, when his daughter, 
Nicolette, left the group. ``I had a rifle, and when he tried to get 
in, I stuck it in his face,'' said Weaver, who has sent his 16-year-old 
daughter out of state to military school. ``They came back a few nights 
later and tried to pry the front door open.'' Weaver's ex-wife, Jan, 
is believed to be Miller's right-hand assistant. Referring to the 
mass suicide by 39 members of the Heaven's Gate group last year, Weaver 
said he feared that the Concerned Christians could take a similar 
turn, saying, ``The best way to describe this is Heaven's Gate.'' 
In interviews on Friday, several other relatives of missing followers 
declined to be identified by name, saying that they feared retaliation 
against their relatives. ``Everybody is getting cryptic messages about 
being near a body of water, that they are having a good time, and 
that the phone lines are bad,'' said one woman, who speculated that 
her relative was in Mexico. Roggeman, the police officer, said about 
20 family members had received similarly vague messages in the last 
month. He speculated that the messages were intended to reduce concern 
and to reduce pressure for a worldwide manhunt.
