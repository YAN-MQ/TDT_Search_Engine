Enveloped in the faint sweetness of incense and their own hypnotic 
singing, eight Buddhist nuns and their abbesses from the cloistered 
imperial convents in Japan on Saturday transplanted a medieval ceremony 
of veneration for the first female Zen master to St. Paul's Chapel 
at Columbia University. The ceremony, attended by about 200 people 
who maintained an awestruck silence for nearly two hours, signified 
an international coup for the university and its Institute for Medieval 
Japanese Studies, the only institute of its kind in the country. Most 
of the nuns had never been outside Japan. For all, it was their first 
visit to the United States. And neither their ordinary monastic ceremonies 
nor the solemn ritual of song and poetic offerings to Abbess Mugai 
Nyodai, a spiritual leader dead for 700 years, had been seen by the 
general public before. Abbess Nyodai, a women of noble birth who was 
taught by a Chinese Zen master, founded the first Buddhist convent 
in Japan in the early 13th century and is considered not only the 
first female master of the meditative discipline but also an instrumental 
figure in spreading Zen Buddhism to Japan. ``She belongs to all of 
us,'' said Barbara Ruch, the director of the institute and the first 
scholar in the world to have been admitted into one of the secluded 
Buddhist convents in Japan to conduct research on Abbess Nyodai and 
the little-known role of women in the nurturing of Zen in Japan. ``I 
promise you, you will never forget her,'' Ms. Ruch added, as an introduction 
to the ceremony. ``She has the ability to empower you and I urge you 
to let her empower you one on one.'' The centerpiece of the ceremony 
was a replica of a life-sized cypress wood statue of the seated abbess, 
on loan from the Kanagawa Prefectural Kanazawa Bunko Museum, along 
with scrolls, documents and imperial court objects sent by various 
Japanese collections. The original statue is believed to date from 
the last years of Abbess Nyodai's life, when she was in her 70s; it 
is kept at one of the convents in Japan. The statue portrays a solid 
woman, her head shaved and her lined face set in an expression of 
serene but almost glum meditation. The replica, the only one in existence, 
will remain on exhibit at the university along with the other monastic 
objects until Dec. 4. The nuns, their heads shaved and their layers 
of silk robes shining as luminously as a Japanese watercolor, shuffled 
gravely through a series of rituals _ lighting candles, offering incense, 
walking in a circle before the statue of Abbess Nyodai and gently 
tossing hand-cut paper petals in homage. The ceremony also mixed western 
traditions with the Buddhist. Members of the Collegium Musicum sang 
a choral tribute to a medieval German Catholic abbess, Hildegard von 
Bingen, and the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, director of the Interfaith 
Center of New York, led a prayer. ``We try to be a very international 
university,'' said Suzanne Trimel, a spokeswoman for Columbia University. 
``Here we are in St. Paul's chapel, which was originally Christian, 
and now we have this wonderful Buddhist ceremony.''
