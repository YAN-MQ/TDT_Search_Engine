Who says Americans have no taste? Garrick Utley goes from the wild 
west to suburban malls to find evidence to the contrary. They are 
the works of great artists -- picasso, Van gogh, seen in leading museums. 
And now also -- in high-rolling, fun-loving Las Vegas, at the new 
upscale bellagio hotel, where expensive masterworks are on display. 
High culture an mass marketing are the now profit-seeking bedfellows. 
In museums, attendance has soared nearly 50% since 1989. Another sign 
of shifting taste -- museum goods are moving to the mall. Amid other 
retailers, customers will find the museum company, one of 85 stores 
in the fast-growing chain. They're looking for something that has 
a pedigree to it, something that has already been approved, if you 
will, by a curator of a museum somewhere. Cultural institutions like 
any market rs are getting better at satisfying advertisers. Several 
things are driving it. There is the increased prosperity for most 
if not all Americans. There is the vastly expanded choice of almost 
everything from clothing, to books, to coffee, to the most sophisticated 
of art. And then there is that natural human curiosity to test and 
taste something new. Example -- opera. Its audiences have grown 35% 
in the past five years, from the metropolitan opera in New York to 
110 other companies in smaller communities, including fargo, North 
Dakota, and most recently -- Waco, Texas. No, they can't take that 
away from me According to the national endowment for the arts, many 
people went to a cultural event or went to a museum last year. Yes, 
a reality check remines us that professional wrestling still dominates 
the ratings on cable television. What if your sister wanted to share 
your lover? And that Jerry spring ser the most watched TV talk show. 
Still, something is changing, more people are buying more books than 
ever, if not all great works of literature. And drinking more cappacino 
and seeking more museum pieces, even if they are reproductions. Garrick 
Utley, CNN, New York.
