Action on the ice and the college basketball courts next in "Headline 
Sports." My dad always said: as soon as I get a computer you'll come 
out with something better. So, to make sure people like dad have the 
latest computer we invented your:)ware-- technology that grows with 
you. For just $49.95 a month you can buy a computer with an Intel 
Pentium II processor Internet access and in two years you can trade 
it in towards the purchase of a new one. What do you call this thing? 
Your:)ware. Call 1-800-gateway and let's talk about your:)ware.
