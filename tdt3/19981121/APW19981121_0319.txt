Austrian police have stepped up security precautions for the protection 
of U.S. facilities in Austria after a reported terrorist warning, 
Interior Minister Karl Schloegl said Saturday. The street on which 
the U.S. Embassy is located, has been permanently closed to traffic 
since Nov. 19. The U.S. State Department said Friday that the U.S. 
Embassy in Vienna had received credible information concerning the 
possibility of a terrorist act in the near future against American-affiliated 
facilities in Austria. In a similar press release, the U.S. Embassy 
in Vienna on Saturday said Austrian authorities had been informed 
``and are taking measures to maximize the security of those facilities 
and provide for public safety.'' It added, ``As noted in the Nov. 
12 Worldwide Caution Public Announcement, American citizens are reminded 
to maintain a high level of vigilance. This guidance is especially 
appropriate at this time in Austria. ``Organizers of any gathering 
in which large numbers of American citizens are participants shold 
ensure that appropriate security measures are taken or, where feasible, 
consider postponement.'' Schloegl, who was asked for a comment outside 
a party meeting, on Saturday confirmed that indications had been received 
in recent days of possible terrorist attacks against U.S. facilities 
in Austria. As a result ``security precautions have been strongly 
increased,'' he added. The minister, as quoted by the Austria Press 
Agency, said he did not want to contribute to unease but caution was 
warranted. U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Hall told Austrian radio that the 
U.S. mission was continuing its work despite a ``credible threat.'' 
She said she was appreciative of the Austrian authorities' prompt 
and efficient response given to the U.S. security needs.
