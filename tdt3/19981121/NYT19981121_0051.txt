The prosecutors who brought homicide charges against 11-year-old Lacresha 
Murray for allegedly killing a 2{-year-old girl now concede that Lacresha's 
so-called confession, obtained during a lengthy grilling by the police 
in Austin, Texas, was worthless. ``She never confessed to anything,'' 
said Gary Cobb, an assistant district attorney in Travis County who 
was the lead prosecutor in the case. ``She said she may have accidentally 
dropped and accidentally kicked the child, which is totally inconsistent 
with the injury. So that played no part in what we did with the case.'' 
(Cobb may have forgotten, but it certainly did play a part. Over the 
objections of the defense, Cobb's team fought successfully to have 
Lacresha's signed statement introduced at her trial.) Lacresha, now 
14, is serving a 25-year sentence for the fatal beating of Jayla Belton 
in May 1996. There was no forensic evidence linking her to the crime, 
nor were there any witnesses alleging that she attacked the child. 
In interviews last week I asked Cobb and his boss, the Travis County 
district attorney, Ronnie Earle, what evidence had convinced them 
that Lacresha was the killer. ``There's a great deal of evidence that 
taken all together is what points to her,'' said Cobb. He said Lacresha 
had the ``opportunity'' to kill the child because she had ``access'' 
to the room Jayla was in at approximately the time of death, ``or 
at least the time that the child started dying.'' When I asked what 
Lacresha had specifically done to Jayla, both Cobb and Earle said 
they believed she had stomped on her. And given the number of injuries, 
said Cobb, it was clear that ``she did something else to her.'' I 
asked what that might have been. Cobb said: ``Well, she could have 
hit her with her fist. She could have hit her up against something. 
She could have kicked her more.'' I said, ``But you don't know whether 
she did or not?'' Cobb replied, presumably sarcastically, ``We don't 
have a videotape of her doing anything.'' I asked several more times 
about the apparent lack of evidence against Lacresha. Earle said, 
``This is a child murder, a baby murder. Almost all murders of infants, 
of children, happen when just two people are present _ the killer 
and the decedent. So there is almost never any evidence of any kind.'' 
He then said there was evidence in this case and it ``all points to 
Lacresha.'' There were two trials, one in the summer of 1996 and another 
in February 1997, each resulting in a guilty verdict. The first verdict 
was thrown out. In that case, the prosecution theorized that Lacresha's 
grandfather, R.L. Murray, had been mistaken when he said he had heard 
Lacresha bouncing a ball in the house on the afternoon in question. 
The prosecutors said that what he heard was not a bouncing ball, but 
Lacresha slamming Jayla against the walls of a room less than a dozen 
feet from where Murray was sitting. That theory was abandoned in the 
second trial. The new theory, never mentioned at the first trial, 
was that Lacresha had stomped on Jayla and that one of her tennis 
shoes had left an impression on the child's chest. That theory, in 
the view of Earle and Cobb, is still viable. Cobb told me last week, 
``We do have a footprint that matches a shoe belonging to Lacresha 
that we were able to match as leaving a skin impression on the child.'' 
Earle described that as ``fairly powerful evidence.'' Neither of the 
men mentioned why such ``powerful'' evidence had not been introduced 
at the first trial. It turns out that the alleged match was bogus, 
even though it was presented to the second jury as ``evidence.'' As 
the second trial was approaching, the DA's office put together photos 
of marks on Jayla's body with photos of a pair of sneakers found in 
the Murray home. They turned the photos over to the state crime lab, 
hoping, apparently in desperation, to have a match declared. In a 
letter dated Feb. 5, 1997, Juan Rojas, an official with the crime 
lab, informed the prosecution team that ``we were unable to testify 
that the marks on Belton's body were made by these shoes due to insufficient 
general characteristics.'' In other words, no match. The jury was 
never told of that letter.
