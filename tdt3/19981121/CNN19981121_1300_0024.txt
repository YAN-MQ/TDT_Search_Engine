President Clinton is in south Korea, but his concerns seem to be focused 
further north. Today, he spoke of a "strong suspicion" north Korea 
is working on an underground nuclear weapons project. The U.S. commander 
in chief urged the communist country to seize what he called an "historic 
opportunity" for peace being extended by south Korea, and allow U.S. 
inspections to highlight his point. President Clinton is showing off 
the U.S. military might. He is scheduled to visit American troops 
based on the border between north and south Korea.
