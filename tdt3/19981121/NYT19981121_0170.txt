Now that Aleksei Kovalev is flying airplanes in his spare time, he 
is approaching literally what his hockey style has always suggested 
in the figurative sense: that he is a space cadet, a daredevil Russian 
cosmonaut, drafted on the first round from Dynamo Moscow in June 1991. 
When Kovalev plays the way he did in the first two games of the New 
York Rangers road trip last week, there is only one question to ask: 
Who are the other candidates for the Hart Trophy as most valuable 
player in the National Hockey League? Unfortunately, Kovalev does 
not always play with the strength, skill and determination he showed 
in scoring two goals and assisting on another over two games on Wednesday 
and Thursday nights, a 3-1 defeat in Anaheim and a 5-1 victory in 
Los Angeles. When Kovalev flies at lower altitudes and with lesser 
attitude, the questions are the same as they have been in his seven 
_ yes, seven! _ seasons in the NHL: Will Kovalev ever mature into 
the all-star that his skills promise? Will the Rangers tire of his 
baffling inconsistency and trade him? Only 25 years old, the flashy 
right wing is at the cusp between ``prospect'' and ``suspect.'' Although 
he has scored 20 or more goals in four seasons, he has yet to launch 
his career to the star level. Earth to Alex: On this mediocre but 
hard-working team that is searching for a virtuoso performer, this 
could be your year. Do you read me? Over. ``Make plays, control the 
game,'' Kovalev said, referring to his objectives. ``Everything comes 
through hard work.'' His hard work was most evident not on goals but 
on shifts that forced opposing players to take penalties. Kovalev 
is so strong, so tricky, so determined that Ducks and Kings were hooking, 
holding and tripping him when he would bull wide, hard and fast around 
them. He forced at least six of these fouls, creating manpower advantages 
for his side. It is the sort of thing that Mario Lemieux used to do. 
``It's not like I think before the game: I've got to draw four or 
five penalties,'' Kovalev said. ``It just happens.'' Bad things happen, 
too. At Anaheim, with Kovalev working the right point on the power 
play, he and Brian Leetch tried a high-risk/high-reward play. Leetch, 
the left point man, dashed down the right side, near the boards. Kovalev, 
unlike the defenseman Leetch, is a forward, not as accustomed to playing 
on the blue line. Instead of safely flipping the puck deep into the 
corner for Leetch to chase, Kovalev tried to finesse a pretty pass 
to Leetch's stick. Ranger fans, and several former Ranger coaches, 
can guess what happened next. With the rear door unguarded, the puck 
was intercepted by Steve Rucchin of the Ducks, who raced in to score 
on a breakaway. But what happened after that was new and different. 
During the previous four seasons, under coach Colin Campbell, Kovalev 
would have been benched and punished, perhaps for the rest of the 
game. Coach John Muckler, who replaced Campbell last February, sent 
Kovalev right back on the ice for the next shift. Kovalev responded 
by creating a play and assisting on Niklas Sundstrom's tying goal. 
``I'm really happy I don't have that hard time anymore, where you 
made a mistake and you get benched,'' Kovalev said. ``You come back 
and you still have a chance to make a nice play and maybe score a 
goal. That's the way to be. I'm really happy about it. Muck gave me 
a real opportunity to play.'' Kovalev did not mention Campbell's name, 
but the inference was clear when he said that he liked Muckler as 
much as Mike Keenan, Campbell's predecessor, who coached the Rangers 
to the Stanley Cup in 1994. ``He tells me lot of things to help me,'' 
Kovalev said of Muckler. ``He talks a lot. He's a really nice coach. 
He helps me a lot and I appreciate it. I really like Keenan. I think 
these are two of the best coaches I've worked with.'' In fairness 
to Campbell, it must be remembered that he, too, tried to communicate 
with Kovalev. They had their feuds, their tests of wills, their reconciliations, 
their parting. The next night in L.A., Kovalev's most dynamic moment 
came not on his goals but on an early body check. In front of the 
team benches, he lined up Matt Johnson, the 6-foot-5-inch, 232-pound 
Kong of the Kings. The force of the hit bent Johnson over the boards 
and left an impression on everyone, especially Johnson. ``I had the 
opportunity to put my body against him,'' Kovalev said. ``That's what 
I did.'' And, once again, in another season, under another coach, 
Kovalev has the opportunities. He has the ice time. He has Wayne Gretzky 
as a linemate. He has the hopes and best wishes of the management, 
his teammates and the fans. So what will he do _ soar with the eagles 
or crash to earth?
