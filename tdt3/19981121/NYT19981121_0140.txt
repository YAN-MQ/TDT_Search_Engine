Milton Kutsher, who built Kutsher's Country Club into one of the leading 
resorts in the Catskills and kept it successful even as many other 
top hotels in the region lost their allure in the 1980s and '90s, 
died Nov. 16 in Monticello, N.Y. He was 82. Kutsher's life spanned 
the rise and fall of the grand Catskills resorts. He was born in Monticello 
in 1916, when the region was still a sleepy mountain enclave of rooming 
houses where Jews in the garment trade could escape the summer heat 
of the city for ``the good air.'' By the middle of the century, the 
Catskills were world famous as the Borscht Belt, a place of large, 
often luxurious hotels and resorts where urban vacationers, mostly 
Jews still hemmed in socially by anti-Semitism, could relax and unwind, 
entertained by some of the most famous names in show business. By 
the time Kutsher died, the Catskills were in decline, a region seemingly 
made vestigial by jet planes, air-conditioning and the loosening of 
religion-based restrictions. But while other resorts like Grossinger's, 
the Concord and Brown's have gone out of business or declared bankruptcy, 
Kutsher's continues to prosper, a tribute, many say, to Milton Kutsher's 
vision. He bound Kutsher's closely to big-time sports, attracting 
heavyweight boxers like Ezzard Charles and Rocky Marciano, who used 
Kutsher's as a training base in the 1950s. Professional basketball 
players still come to Kutsher's for the annual Maurice Stokes exhibition 
game, which raises money for needy former NBA players. Amateur sports 
was a major attraction in the Catskills. Resorts would field basketball 
teams made up of staff members and compete against one another, drawing 
visitors up from the city to watch (and bet) on the games. Kutsher 
was an expert at hiring the best high school and college players to 
work summers, like a skinny high school student named Wilt Chamberlain, 
who worked there as a bellhop in the early 1950s. ``When I got Wilt, 
I was looking around for the right coach to work with him,'' Kutsher 
recalled years later. A guest told him about a man who had once coached 
his son, and might need a job. ``That's how I got Red Auerbach to 
coach Kutsher's basketball team,'' Kutsher said of the man who would 
later gain fame as the coach of the Boston Celtics. Like the other 
resorts, Kutsher's in the 1960s had a roster of comedians like Shecky 
Greene and Alan King, but as the years passed Kutsher tried to keep 
the acts current. Until his television show took off, Jerry Seinfeld 
was a frequent performer at Kutsher's, said Kutsher's daughter Mady 
Prowler. ``This is one of the few resorts that continues to attract 
a crowd,'' said Myrna Katz Frommer, who, with her husband, Harvey 
Frommer, wrote ``It Happened in the Catskills: An Oral History in 
the Words of Busboys, Bellhops, Guests, Proprietors, Comedians, Agents 
and Others Who Lived It'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1991). ``It's 
a very special place in that it has a true family feel. It's luxurious 
without being tacky, and he never allowed it to get run down.'' Through 
it all, Kutsher and his wife, the former Helen Wasser, were a constant, 
visible presence. They appeared at every meal, and they remembered 
the names of their guests. ``If she saw a piece of paper on the floor, 
she'd pick it up,'' Ms. Frommer said. ``She'd say, `This is MY home.''' 
Kutsher represented the second generation in his family to operate 
Kutsher's, which was founded by his father and uncle in 1907. After 
graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937 and serving 
in the Army in the Pacific during World War II, he returned to Monticello 
and took over Kutsher's, expanding it from a small operation into 
one of the region's biggest resorts; it now has 410 rooms. Kutsher 
made sure that his children also became involved, and today his son, 
Mark Kutsher, runs Kutsher's with Helen Kutsher. In addition to his 
wife and son, Kutsher is survived by two daughters, Ms. Prowler of 
Philadelphia and Karen Wilson of Bryn Mawr, Pa., and seven grandchildren. 
Besides the country club, Kutsher also ran Kutsher's Sport Academy 
and a summer camp for children, and was a trustee of the National 
Basketball Association Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. One thing 
Kutsher did not like was the term Borscht Belt. ``I don't think he 
liked the idea that a place was depicted by a soup,'' Ms. Prowler 
said. ``He thought it sounded too cliquish and closed off to the world, 
though he had no problem with it being known as a Jewish resort.'' 
Speaking of the hotel Thursday, Ms. Prowler said, ``This weekend is 
totally booked,'' which would have been music to Kutsher's ears.
