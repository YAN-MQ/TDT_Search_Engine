The recent murder of a Russian politician has dealt a serious blow 
to the country's reform process. As Jill Dougherty reports, the co-chairperson 
of the democratic Russia party will be hard to replace. According 
to police in St. Petersburg, Galina starovoitova, along with an aide, 
was cornered in the stairwell of her downtown apartment building. 
Two attackers opened fire. Starovoitova died on the spot. Her aide 
was rushed to the hospital with serious head wounds. News of the killing 
hit like a shock wave. President Boris Yeltsin, through his spokesman, 
said he was "stunned," and "To the depths of his soul, outraged." 
He said he was taking personal control of the investigation and immediately 
dispatched his top security official to St. Petersburg. Sergei stepashin 
said the crime is being considered possible terrorism. Prime minister 
Yevgeny Primakov called it "banditry." The criminals will be found 
and severely punished. We must find out who is behind them. Galina 
starovoitova, 52 years old, was one of the leading lights of the pro-democracy 
movement in Russia. An outspoken campaigner for reform under Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, she later served as adviser to President 
Yeltsin. She was a member of the current Russian parliament and co-chairman 
of the democratic Russia party. Starovoitova reportedly was considering 
running for governor of St. petersburg. In recent weeks, she spoke 
out forcefully against anti-semitic comments by a nationalist politician. 
Historian dmitri likhachev, one of Russia's most revered figures, 
said he can't see anyone who can replace starovoitova. Her murder 
will have a resounding impact on our political life. And that impact 
will be bad, because people will be afraid to behave as courageously 
as she used to do. The morning after her murder, Galina starovoitova's 
associates held a moment of silence. "Just recently she said, 'there've 
been so many threats, so many times they've said they'd kill me, that 
I'm not afraid at all. They know where I live. Let them come.'" Jill 
Dougherty, CNN, Moscow.
