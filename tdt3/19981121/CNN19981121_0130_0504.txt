snow in the northwest, isolated showers along the gulf coast, with 
some lingering showers and snow showers in the northeast. By Sunday

U.S. could see some clouds and drizzle due to a warm front. Highs 
on Saturday, pretty mild across the nation, Wisconsin and the northeast, 
however, seeing highs only in the 30s. Your extended forecast for
