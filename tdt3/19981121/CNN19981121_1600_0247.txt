During his weekly radio address, President Clinton thanked the U.S. 
military for its service and commitment. He gave particular mention 
to the troops stationed overseas. Mr. Clinton says he has taken steps 
to preserve the country's military readiness through reviews and budget 
proposals. He also focused on U.S. efforts to help strengthen ties 
in Asia. I have reaffirmed America's commitment to our alliances with 
Japan and korea, and our resolve to build a safer, better world with 
our Asian allies. My confidence that such a world is within our grasp 
springs in no small measure from my faith in the strength and skills 
of a remarkable group of americans -- the men and women who serve 
in our armed forces. Tomorrow, President Clinton is scheduled to visit 
two U.S. air force bases in south Korea that are home to 40,000 troops.
