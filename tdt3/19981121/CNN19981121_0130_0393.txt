The FBI has opened a $20 million strategic information and operations 
center, which it says will allow agents to manage five crises at once. 
Investigators say they realized they had outgrown the old facility 
two years ago while trying to juggle several big cases. Located at 
FBI headquarters in Washington, the new center is as large as a Football 
field. It was opened in a ribbon cutting ceremony that included former 
president george bush. If Tony Bennett left his heart in San Francisco, 
a part of Barbara's and a Part of mine remains here in Washington. 
Barbara is out at the mayo clinic board meeting. She's a faithful 
member of that board,or she would be here, she modestly refers to 
herself as the mother of governors. The FBI marks its 90th anniversary 
this year.
