Opening day of the New York Mets' 1997 season is still a blur to Pete 
Harnisch, who started the game thinking he had a firm grip on both 
the baseball and his life. Within weeks, he was one of the most public 
of the estimated 19 million Americans who experienced depression that 
year. His willingness to reveal his illness and his solid comeback 
last season with Cincinnati have made him something of a mental health 
role model, if a slightly edgy one. ``I'm no crusader; don't give 
me this bold, stepping-out stuff,'' Harnisch said last week. ``I just 
think a guy should do what's right, which is letting people know you 
can get through this thing, you can get your life and your personality 
back.'' Harnisch calls ``this thing,'' which cost him most of his 
eighth big-league season, a ``depressive episode.'' He recoils at 
being considered a poster boy for depression. He is not comfortable 
with the term ``mental illness.'' His own explanation is that his 
body chemistry was destabilized when he abruptly quit a 13-year chewing 
tobacco habit during spring training. Even such a reluctant role model 
as Harnisch is rare and courageous in sports, where the discussion 
of any kind of mental illness doesn't seem to have progressed much 
beyond the 1950s Jimmy (``Fear Strikes Out'') Piersall story. SportsWorld 
alternately hides and rewards behavior that would be considered antisocial, 
if not downright dangerous, in most other industries. It rarely pays 
attention to any emotional problems unless they interfere with performance. 
Harnisch, a bluff, direct 32-year-old, crew-cut and bull-necked, steered 
away from such abstract discussions last week during a two-hour conversation 
at a Freehold, N.J., diner near where he is living. The interview 
had been promoted by a public relations firm representing SmithKline 
Beecham, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Paxil, the antidepressant 
Harnisch took for six months. The company pays Harnisch to make appearances 
and give interviews. A hard-driving, sometimes tempestuous right-hander 
who kicks walls and water coolers when his fastball fails to pop, 
Harnisch was neither dramatic nor particularly clinical in his descriptions 
of that lost season. He made it clear that certain details _ including 
side effects from the drug and the effect of the illness on his relationships 
_ were too personal to discuss. Harnisch says his problems began in 
late March 1997, with an almost casual decision on a Miami golf course 
to stop ``dipping,'' at least temporarily. He could not recall, he 
says, any early clues to future depression. At the tail end of the 
exhibition season, a few days after quitting tobacco ``cold turkey,'' 
he woke up sweating heavily, a first. He was chilled and experienced 
a murkiness, as if he were moving through a fog. Usually one of the 
louder and more convivial clubhouse characters, he suddenly ``felt 
like an outsider.'' He wondered if he was coming down with a virus, 
then if he had a brain tumor. He was unable to sleep more than an 
hour or two a night, and lost his appetite. He confided mostly in 
his wife, Donna, and the Mets' trainer, Fred Hina, who eventually 
gave him sleeping pills for the night before his opening-day start, 
in San Diego. He still didn't sleep. Jocks plow through. Harnisch 
dimly remembers five good innings before the Padres hit three straight 
home runs. He insists the hits were ``a freak'' and had nothing to 
do with his condition. He felt ``cooked'' after the game, and slept 
well that night. He figured he had come through the crisis. Then it 
got worse. He lost more weight _ eventually 35 pounds from a 6-foot, 
228-pound body _ and was too weak to pitch. The Mets sent him back 
to New York for tests. After an eventual diagnosis of depression, 
there was talk and drug therapy. He was placed on the disabled list 
and began a long, slow rehabilitation that included a stint in the 
minors. It was his idea to reveal his condition in a conference call 
with sportswriters in late April 1997, rather than concoct a story 
about a physical illness. Of course, he considers it a physical illness. 
``I know me, who I am, and I never looked in the mirror and said, 
`You are mentally ill,''' he said. ``There was down time and self-doubt, 
but I see it mostly like a long cold, a cold in my brain.'' Harnisch 
returned to the Mets that August. Last year, with the Reds, he started 
32 games, winning 14 and losing 7, and posted an earned run average 
of 3.14. He has been on the short list for various comeback awards. 
It is hard to judge whether he is remarkably unself-aware or truly 
successful at ``putting it all behind me.'' He says he is the same 
as he was before, yet different. ``I'm stronger now,'' he said. ``After 
Brett Butler came back from cancer, he said that what he went through 
put baseball in perspective, it was just a game, and I thought, `yeah, 
yeah,' but now I know what he meant. You have a tendency to let the 
game run your life, to be miserable after a bad game, a bad article. 
``That doesn't mean I'm not still competitive, I still throw temper 
tantrums when I pitch bad, and there are things that still scare me. 
Like this.'' He poked his finger into his mouth. ``I got to go see 
the dentist today. It could be root canal.''
