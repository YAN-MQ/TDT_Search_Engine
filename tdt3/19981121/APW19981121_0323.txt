Defending Olympic champion the Netherlands maintained a perfect record 
with an easier-than-expected victory Saturday against the United States 
15-12, 15-6, 15-11 in the second round of the Men's World Volleyball 
Championships. The United States, with losses already to Russia and 
Italy, is among four teams in Group H with no wins. The top two teams 
in each of the two groups advance to the finals. ``This was a very 
important game for us,'' said Dutch head coach Toon Gerbrands. ``I 
have a lot of respect for the Americans. They are the best fighters.'' 
American captain Lloyd Ball acknowledged his team had a tough fight. 
``How much harder can it get? I still believe we're a good team,'' 
he said. Head coach Douglas Beal said the team was improving. ``Making 
decisions is hard for us. We notice a change, but it takes a while 
for everyone to adapt,'' Beal said. Yugoslavia and Italy, as well 
as Russia, also have three wins and no losses in the group. In Group 
G, Brazil, Spain and Cuba also emerged with three wins and no losses 
after Saturday's matches. Spain, which has no world or Olympic title, 
has been a surprise at the championships. On Saturday, the Spanish 
team _ which selects a player ahead of each match to shave his head 
for good luck _ beat Bulgaria 17-15, 15-4, 15-11. In other Group G 
play in Hiroshima, western Japan, Cuba, whose women's team defended 
its world title last Thursday, beat South Korea 15-13, 15-9, 15-7. 
Brazil edged Japan 15-11, 15-9, 15-13. Canada managed its first win, 
defeating Argentina 15-11, 10-15, 15-4, 15-6. In Group H, Italy defeated 
China 15-5, 15-4, 15-5, and Yugoslavia defeated the Ukraine 15-9, 
15-10, 15-1, at Chiba-Makuhari Messe Hall near Tokyo. Greece managed 
to win one set, but was downed by Russia 12-15, 15-6, 15-11, 15-6. 
The men's championship started Nov. 13 with 24 teams, and 16 advanced 
to the current round, which lasts until Nov. 26. The semifinals and 
finals will be played in Tokyo Nov. 28-29.
