Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Saturday harshly warned Italy 
against granting political asylum to a Kurdish rebel leader wanted 
on terrorism charges in Turkey. Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If 
it does, Turkey will not leave this unanswered,'' Yilmaz said. An 
Italian court rejected a Turkish warrant for the arrest of Abdullah 
Ocalan on Friday under a law barring extradition to countries where 
suspects faces the death penalty. On Saturday, Ocalan was freed from 
custody. Turkey said it would appeal the court's decision. ``I have 
a few words to say to our friend and ally Italy,'' Yilmaz said at 
a convention of his center-right Motherland Party. ``Italy's biggest 
error would be to open its arms to the bloodiest terrorist in the 
world.'' Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has 
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey 
that has claimed 37,000 lives. He is on trial in absentia in Turkey 
on capital charges. On Saturday, Ocalan left the hospital outside 
Rome where he'd been in custody since his arrest Nov. 12 for a private 
residence in the Italian capital The court has ordered him to stay 
in Rome, but that restriction could be lifted next month. The Turkish 
newspaper Hurriyet said Saturday that Libya might offer him refuge 
if he leaves Italy. In Germany, the federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe 
said Saturday that a new arrest warrant had been issued for Ocalan, 
but it did not necessarily mean Germany would seek extradition.
