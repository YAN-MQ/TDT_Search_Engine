A Chinook will push temperatures to near-record levels across the 
foothills and high plains to the east of the central Rockies on Saturday 
as winds from the west warm on descent from lofty peaks. Afternoon 
temperatures will soar above 70 degrees as far north as Nebraska. 
The strongest winds will occur in eastern Colorado, western Nebraska, 
and western Kansas, where speeds will average 20-40 mph. Gusts of 
50 mph or more are possible in eastern Colorado below narrow mountain 
passes. Blowing dust will limit visibility in some areas. Temperatures 
will soar 10-15 degrees above Saturday's readings across the Ohio 
Valley and southern Great Lakes, but dry winds from the southwest 
averaging 15-25 mph will likely lessen the feel of the warmer air. 
Snow will fall in the northern Rockies from Idaho to western Wyoming 
and northern Utah as a Pacific jet stream disturbance races east. 
The brunt of the snow will fall during the first half of the day. 
In the settling wake of the disturbance, a few showers will form from 
western Washington to northwest California as abating but still moist 
ocean winds persist. Generally light to moderate snows will fall in 
the Cascades, the northern Sierra and Siskiyous. Another potent storm 
system will approach the Pacific Northwest on Monday. A deep chill 
will numb parts of the Middle Atlantic and Southeast states early 
Sunday morning as strong, cold high pressure drifts east across the 
region. Monday, the high will pump milder air toward the Northeast, 
heralding an early week warm-up. Focus: Capital Drought A severe drought 
persists in Washington, D.C., where, on Friday, a paltry 0.07 inches 
of rain hardly settled the dust. Since July 1, there have been only 
three days when 0.5 inches of rain or more fell in the city. Moreover, 
only 4.75 inches of rain have been measured since July 1. In the nearly 
130 years of records, only 1930 rivals the current dry spell, with 
5.29 inches of rain falling from July through November. Assuming that 
the drought persists, the city's all-time record dry spell for the 
latter six months of the year, 6.79 inches of rain, which was also 
set in 1930, could be broken.
