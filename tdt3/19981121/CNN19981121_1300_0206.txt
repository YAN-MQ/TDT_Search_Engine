Federal officials say they've indicted 31 people in a smuggling ring 
that brought in 12,000 illegal immigrants to the United States. The 
immigration and naturalization service says it's the largest illegal 
immigrant operation ever uncovered. The ring charged $20,000 per person, 
and made $200 million in three years. Most of the illegal immigrants 
came from India. Others were from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. 
Attorney general Janet Reno says the crackdown is a warning to those 
who flout U.S. immigration laws.
