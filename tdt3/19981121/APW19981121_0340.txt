London Saturday launched its bid for the 2003 track and field World 
Championships, just two days after Edmonton, Canada, landed the 2001 
worlds. The event _ considered the third most prestigious internationally 
behind the Olympics and soccer's World Cup _ is being planned for 
Wembley Stadium. The 75-year-old stadium, host to the 1948 Olympics 
and 1966 World Cup, is to be revamped next year as the centerpiece 
of England's bid to land the 2006 World Cup. With the worlds going 
to North America for the first time, it makes it more likely a European 
city will be named. ``Staging the championships at Wembley would be 
a fantastic boost for British athletics,'' said David Hemery, newly 
elected president of Athletics UK who presented the bid Saturday of 
IAAF president Primo Nebiolo. ``I am delighted to have this launch 
as one of my first roles as president of Athletics UK,'' he added. 
``I believe that it will be an integral part of our future to play 
host to major events.'' David Moorcroft, CEO of Athletics UK, suggested 
the Canadian victory would bode well for London. ``It may be good 
news for us,'' he said. ``We would hope that the world championships 
would come to Europe in 2003.'' Paris and Stanford, Calif., which 
both lost out to Edmonton, are also viewed as possible bidders. The 
winner is expected to be named next May by the IAAF at a meeting in 
Seville, Spain. Seville hosts next year's worlds Aug. 20-29.
