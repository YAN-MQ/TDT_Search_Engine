As a withering year draws to a close with her husband's threatened 
impeachment, Hillary Rodham Clinton prevails above the American landscape 
in all her signature duality. There she is, darkly scored once more 
as the obsessive footnote in the persistent Whitewater investigation 
of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who ardently wants Congress 
to impeach President Clinton. Yet there she is, too, reigning brightly 
on the cover of Vogue magazine _ the first time a first lady has been 
so honored, and a decision mandated, the editors say, by Mrs. Clinton's 
exuberant, triumphant campaign barnstorming to defend the careers 
of Democrats in Congress and thereby her husband. In weathering a 
trying year, Mrs. Clinton has taken on an unexpected political heft 
that even some Republicans have to acknowledge. ``Give her credit 
for getting her arms around this thing,'' said Rich Galen, the strategist 
for House Republicans who thinks the first lady has progressed smartly 
beyond her early errors, which Republicans once gleefully exploited. 
``She learned the lesson that she couldn't be co-president. She stoically 
went through the Monica stuff and has come out shining _ and come 
out swinging. She's become the one beacon of light in the entire administration.'' 
Whatever her personal scars, Democrats gratefully note that Mrs. Clinton 
managed to repair her popular standing through the very role she once 
mocked as that of a one-dimensional spouse: standing by her man. But 
she did so by brandishing her strength in issue-oriented politics 
as a campaign tonic for all the lurid wallowing that marked the year. 
``For Hillary, it's the best of times and the worst of times,'' said 
George Stephanopoulos, the television commentator and former White 
House political strategist. ``She is the key to the strange success 
of this year. If at any moment she had winked or hinted at any real 
distance between her and the president, then that's it, the president 
loses.'' As it is, the combativeness trumpeted by Mrs. Clinton herself 
in the stunning first days of the president's sex scandal last January 
remains the keynote for both Clintons 10 months later as a skittish 
Congress labors to close out the impeachment struggle. By seizing 
the hustings as her personal outlet in a catastrophic year, Mrs. Clinton 
has become widely hailed as the year's surprise politician _ the most 
dominant popular campaigner in the November elections that cut the 
Republican majority in Congress and toppled such Clinton antagonists 
as Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New 
York. ``We may have just witnessed the first step in the independent 
life she is more likely to lead after this is all over,'' Doris Kearns 
Goodwin, the historian steeped in the struggles of Eleanor Roosevelt, 
said of Mrs. Clinton's ability to forge a political identity beyond 
her charismatic, wayward husband. ``Hillary Clinton showed a certain 
kind of strength under enormous pressure, an ability to keep her public 
persona strong and classy while all the turmoil was going on about 
her. ``These are qualities needed in public life. Maybe it's going 
to be her turn next.'' Some Democrats already speculate on whether 
she might eventually run for the Senate _ her campaign popularity 
was high in her home state of Illinois _ and so truly prevail beyond 
her husband and his harrowing incumbency. Such heady talk is remarkable 
considering how she was the first lady once demonized by critics as 
the unelected overreacher when her early health-care effort failed. 
Talk-radio conservatives have long delighted in finding her ambitious 
hand in such haunting issues as Whitewater. ``Well, now Hillary has 
become the Wronged Woman and has the sympathy factor, which is something 
everybody is much more comfortable with than the strong, determined 
Hillary,'' said Arianna Huffington, a conservative columnist, fascinated 
by the first lady's resilience at the side of her husband. Ms. Huffington 
measured the upturn in Mrs. Clinton's popularity even before the sex 
scandal, the columnist said, ``when she abandoned the tough issues.'' 
The first lady, Ms. Huffington said, retreated to more traditional 
helpmate projects, including children's issues, a premillennial touring 
in behalf of national heritage, and her new book, ``Dear Socks, Dear 
Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets.'' Mrs. Clinton remains in 
overdrive after her 19-state tour of speaking relentlessly for scores 
of Democratic candidates. She is currently touring Latin America, 
with special attention to hurricane-ravaged areas, and has national-heritage 
trips planned to New York, Boston and California, before she heads 
to the Middle East with the president next month. ``Nobody, save perhaps 
her husband, shrugs off public humiliation as elegantly as Mrs. Clinton,'' 
concluded The Economist, the British weekly with a special eye for 
the United States. The first lady was hailed by the weekly as both 
``the most ruthless of her husband's spin doctors'' and his most enduring 
defender. Some Clintonites still rue her reported dominance in the 
White House's early opposition to an out-of-court settlement in the 
Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit _ the fuse that lit the sex-and-mendacity 
scandal now before Congress. But they bless her steely performance 
since then in contending that the problem was rooted in some ``vast 
right-wing conspiracy,'' and not in the president's outright denial 
of sexual dalliance about which he finally had to admit misleading 
the nation. Clinton also said he misled his wife. ``As the year unfolded, 
Hillary found this inner strength,'' said Anna Wintour, editor in 
chief of Vogue, explaining why the story was put on the cover. ``I 
think she psychs herself into this battle mode and goes forward, not 
looking right or left. She told us she doesn't even read the newspapers.'' 
The Vogue display coincided with Starr's latest Whitewater indictment 
of Webster Hubbell, the former Justice Department official and law 
partner of Mrs. Clinton in Little Rock, Ark. The first lady was repeatedly 
referred to in the indictment as the Hubbell ``billing partner.'' 
This was an echo of the confrontation three years ago when a carefully 
composed Mrs. Clinton had to walk past a throng of journalists to 
go before a grand jury in Starr's unsuccessful attempt to implicate 
her in Whitewater crimes. ``Hillary Rodham Clinton is not the kind 
of woman those men understand,'' Ms. Wintour said of the Starr investigators' 
frustration in trying to single out the first lady, only to see her 
become the pillar in the president's job-approval rating. Sen. Barbara 
Boxer, D-Calif., who was re-elected with the aid of Mrs. Clinton, 
recalled the power of the first lady's several campaign visits at 
some of the worst moments of the year for the Clintons. ``She had 
the courage to face the cameras, a courage that brought a lot of people 
to their feet,'' Boxer said. ``Her special quality is to see a larger 
picture than the daily travail of life.'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, 
the Senate Democratic campaign chairman, studied Mrs. Clinton closely 
in her tour and prized her passion for the task. ``You could see the 
strain on her,'' Torricelli said. ``But what is most remarkable is 
that there was no one even close to being in demand like Hillary Rodham 
Clinton as a campaigner. ``Something powerful has taken place,'' he 
said of Mrs. Clinton as the resurgent campaigner. The hecklers still 
dog her with signs (``Queen of Denial''). But the senator found them 
no match for the ``enormous satisfaction'' he saw in the first lady's 
avid return to such major issues as Social Security, health care and 
education as she lambasted Republicans who drove her from the debating 
scene four years ago. ``Hillary Clinton represents for so many Americans 
the problems and struggles in their own lives,'' Torricelli said. 
``She's obviously a symbol for my generation of people with deep personal 
problems in complex times. And she has survived.'' The senator thinks 
Mrs. Clinton has survived as a gifted politician, one who could find 
her own constituency beyond her husband's time. ``I wouldn't want 
to be the Republican candidate to oppose her,'' he said.
