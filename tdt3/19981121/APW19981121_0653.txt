Some 4,000 teachers at public high schools suspended a strike Saturday, 
pending further negotiations. The teachers' trade union said in a 
statement they would resume talks with the government, the Lebanese 
Broadcasting Corporation, a local television channel, reported. The 
strike, which began Nov. 9, had closed 193 public schools, leaving 
more than 65,000 high school students without classes. The teachers 
struck Nov. 9, saying that their end-of-service compensation should 
be calculated on the basis of their full salaries. Last month the 
government offered to calculate the compensation on the basis of 85 
percent of the final salaries. In Lebanon, retirement pay is generally 
given in one lump sum, called end-of-service compensation, in which 
the worker receives a payment equal to one month's pay _ or a percentage 
of the pay _ for each year worked. Teachers' salaries run from dlrs 
250 a month to dlrs 1,000 in public schools and from dlrs 550 a month 
to dlrs 1,000 in private ones.
