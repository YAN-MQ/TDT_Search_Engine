I give up. This money stuff is so complicated. At MetLife, our financial 
professionals still believe the best way to discuss your financial 
future is face-to-face. So we'll go out of our way to deliver advice 
and information about mutual funds and annuities, as well as insurance. 
We'll even make house calls. Which is why so many people consider 
their MetLife financial professional their friend for life.
