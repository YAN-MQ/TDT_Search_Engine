Traffic on highway 104 in northwestern Washington state is flowing 
a lot smoother today. A 300-foot section of the hood canal bridge 
failed to close yesterday, backing traffic up for miles. The floating 
bridge got stuck after letting a boat pass underneath. It was reopened 
late last night, after state crews worked eight hours to fix a hydraulic 
failure.
