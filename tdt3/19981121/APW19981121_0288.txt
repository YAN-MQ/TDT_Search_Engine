In an open letter to President Boris Yeltsin, the leader of a southern 
Russian region said Saturday that his call for greater autonomy from 
Moscow was misunderstood. Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of Kalmykia, 
said Tuesday on Russian television that the federal government had 
failed to deliver subsidies to his republic and that he would push 
for secession. ``The whole meaning of my statement came down to the 
point that Kalmykia for 400 years has been a reliable and stable part 
of Russia and that we do not see ourselves outside the Russian Federation,'' 
Ilyumzhinov said in his letter, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
The Russian Security Council met Saturday to discuss Ilyumzhinov's 
televised statement, but did not reveal what action they might recommend. 
Yeltsin denounced Ilyumzhinov's statements Friday, saying that ``any 
attempts to revise the federal structure of Russia, or rewrite our 
constitution are very dangerous in our situation,'' presidential spokesman 
Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters. Yakushkin said he could not rule 
out Yeltsin's ordering direct presidential rule over Kalmykia in response 
to Ilyumzhinov's call for greater autonomy. After the Security Council 
meeting, Ilyumzhinov told reporters that he firmly believed the region 
should remain a part of Russia. ``All of my acts were always aimed 
at preservation and consolidation of the Russian Federation,'' he 
said. But, he added, regions should be granted more economic rights 
to cope with the country's financial crisis.
