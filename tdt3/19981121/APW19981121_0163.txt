BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspection teams went to work as usual Saturday 
as a new dispute appeared to be developing over documents related 
to Iraq's biological and chemical weapons. At least four cars with 
inspectors pulled out of U.N. headquarters in Baghdad on the fourth 
consecutive day of field work since the teams returned from Bahrain, 
to where they were evacuated after the United States threatened missile 
strikes. Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission, 
which oversees the inspections, would say only that ``We are carrying 
on with our activities.'' UNSCOM is not making public how many teams 
are working each day or where they are going. Iraq's National Monitoring 
Authority, which provides escorts for the UNSCOM teams, has said they 
visited more than 23 sites in and out of Baghdad during inspections 
from Wednesday through Friday. The disagreement over documents, however, 
threatened to undo the uneasy truce reached just a week ago, when 
Iraq pledged to cooperate fully with UNSCOM, which is charged with 
eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range 
missiles. Its partner agency, the Vienna-headquartered International 
Atomic Energy Agency, oversees the destruction of nuclear weapons. 
Iraq in August began curtailing the work of the inspectors, and on 
Oct. 31 halted all UNSCOM work. After the United States and Britain 
threatened military action, Baghdad on Nov. 14 backed down and said 
it would resume cooperation. But on Friday, U.N. officials in New 
York said Iraq was objecting to three letters from UNSCOM chief Richard 
Butler asking for access to documents related to Iraq's chemical and 
biological programs. Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, 
told Butler in a letter that his request ``seems to be provocative 
rather than professional,'' When asked about the latest dispute, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton gave a cautious response. Speaking Saturday 
at a news conference in Seoul, South Korea, he said: ``I think It's 
important that we not over react here on the first day. I want to 
make sure that I know exactly what the facts are.'' He said he would 
be briefed later by his advisers on an issue he said was ``quite important.'' 
U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, speaking to reporters 
later in Seoul, gave a stronger response. Asked whether Washington 
would take military action if Iraq did not hand over the documents, 
he said: ``Clearly in our judgment Iraq has an obligation to produce 
the documents that UNSCOM is seeking and we will support UNSCOM in 
that effort. ``If we reach the conclusion that the answer to those 
questions is negative, we obviously are prepared to act.'' Among other 
documents, Butler reportedly is seeking an Iraqi air force diary, 
which inspectors discovered during a July search but were prevented 
from taking, that details munitions destroyed during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq 
war. Al-Qaisi repeated Iraq's earlier position on the document, saying 
that U.N. weapons experts could view ``relevant portions'' of it in 
the presence of Prakash Shah, the envoy to Iraq of U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan. Iraq agreed to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM in 
hopes of speeding up a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the U.N. 
Security Council of its compliance so far on U.N. disarmament resolutions. 
It wants that review to lead to an easing or lifting of the sweeping 
sanctions imposed by the council after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, 
which sparked the 1991 Gulf War. The United States has said, however, 
that action on the sanctions will not automatically follow the review. 
The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit the sale of oil and bar 
most financial dealings _ have seriously damaged Iraq's once-rich 
economy.
