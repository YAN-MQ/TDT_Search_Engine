President Clinton says the government will make it affordable for 
low-income, disabled Americans to live in decent homes. In his weekly 
radio address, he said "Americans should never have to choose between 
putting a meal on the table or putting a roof over their heads." He 
says new federal housing grants will help them avoid paying more than 
one-third of their income on rent. Earlier this month, another $700 
million in grants was announced. Today I'm also pleased to announce 
nearly $130 million for new housing vouchers to help people with disabilities 
in over 200 communities afford housing in the neighborhood of their 
choice. Together with our new housing grants, these steps will help 
nearly 30,000 americans.
