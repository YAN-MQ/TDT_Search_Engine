The impeachment process on Capitol Hill is the main topic tomorrow 
on NBC's "Meet the press." Three members of the house Judiciary committee, 
republicans Lindsey Graham and Ed Bryant and democrat Sheila Jackson 
Lee are among Tim russert's guests. When "NBC nightly news" continues 
in a moment -- the standoff with Saddam and how some Iraqis are cashing 
in despite economic sanctions. And later, in "focus" -- the new FBI 
turning to scholars to help keep the peace. I've just got this burning 
love for food. But sometimes it just doesn't love me back. Heartburn 
surging up to here. What my doctor calls acid reflux. When I get it, 
he says get gaviscon. Only regular gaviscon forms a soothing, protective 
barrier to help keep stomach acid down -- where it belongs. Mylanta 
can't -- pepcid ac can't. Only gaviscon can. So my heartburn doesn't 
come back to burn me. It helps keep acid down where it be longs.
