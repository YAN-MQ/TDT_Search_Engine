Albanian President Rexhep Meidani signed the nation's first post-communist 
constitution Saturday, proclaiming it effective immediately. Thanking 
international officials for supporting the referendum process, Meidani 
called the country's new constitution ``the symbol of Albania's European 
future.'' The document outlines civil, democratic and human rights 
in the country of 3.2 million, which emerged from communism in 1991. 
According to Albania's Central Voting Commission, slightly more than 
half of the country's registered voters participated in the election 
last weekend, and an overwhelming 93 percent voted in favor of the 
constitution. Sali Berisha, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, 
has said his party would refuse to recognize the constitution as legitimate. 
On Saturday, he called a rally in the capital's main square to protest 
adopting the new constitution. About 2,000 people attended the demonstration, 
which took place without incident. In the run-up to the elections, 
Western officials in the region encouraged Albanians to vote in favor 
of the document, which they see as necessary for strengthening the 
Balkan nation's fragile democracy.
