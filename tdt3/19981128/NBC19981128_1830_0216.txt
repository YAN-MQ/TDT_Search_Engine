To our nation's capital, where republicans and democratics are reviewing 
the president's responses to 81 questions posed by the house Judiciary 
committee. The president often pleads Forgetfulness. President Clinton

99nothing new. President Clinton remained out of sight at the White 
House today, amid expressions of disappointment and even outrage on 
the part of several republican members of the Judiciary committee 
who say his answers offered nothing new. I think the president was 
evasive as he was previously in some of the answers he gave in depositions 
to the grand jury. Congressman Jim Moran of Virginia, a democrat, 
called the president's answers disappointing. 22 times he said he 
doesn't recall. The president has a bear-trap memory. But reading 
these answers, you'd think he was suffering from Alzheimer's. But 
Mr. Clinton has his defenders. This was an attempt by Mr. Hyde and 
the republicans on the committee to get the president to convict himself 
out of his own mouth. White House aides say the president's written 
responses to the committee were clear, that he did not lie under oath 
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky while acknowledging doing 
wrong and misleading friends, advisers and the public. The closest 
Mr. Clinton came to admitting wrongdoing was in response to questions 
about this statement to the reporters on January 26th. I did not have 
sexual relations with that woman, miss Lewinsky. In his written response 
Mr. Clinton said he was referring to intercourse and then conceded 
that -- the president speaks of "misleading the public" four times 
and calls his conduct "wrong" twice. He states flatly -- it's unlikely 
the president will accept the committee's invitation to testify in 
person in his own defense. Instead aides say his lawyers are likely 
to make the final arguments before the committee votes on impeachment 
in mid-December. John Palmer, NBC news, at the White House.
