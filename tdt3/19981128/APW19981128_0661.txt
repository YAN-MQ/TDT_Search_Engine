After gaining an extra week to decide whether to allow the extradition 
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Spanish charges including genocide, Britain's 
government faced continuing pressure from Chile Saturday to let the 
former dictator come home. ``The Chilean people have to be allowed 
to judge and decide how they are going to deal with their past,'' 
Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said in a British Broadcasting 
Corp. radio interview. ``These processes are going on and I fully 
expect they will result in justice.'' Fourteen lawsuits were already 
pending in Chile, and Pinochet had no immunity from prosecution, said 
Insulza, who was himself an exile during Pinochet's rule. Chilean 
legal experts believe an extradition request by Chile should take 
precedence over those from Spain or other European nations who also 
want to try the 83-year-old former dictator, because he is a Chilean 
and the alleged crimes were committed in Chile. Trying Pinochet at 
home, however, would face some complex hurdles, as he has wide immunity 
as a life member of the Chilean senate, and is further protected by 
an amnesty law he issued during his regime. ``I can assure you that 
the cases are going to be prosecuted,'' Insulza said at a news conference 
Saturday. ``I can never say that somebody is going to be condemned 
until the trial is over, of course.'' He added: ``I must remind you 
that there are several people in jail in Chile for violations of human 
rights, condemned for violations of human rights. So some cases have 
been opened, accused, tried and condemned.'' In an interview on Spanish 
National Television TVE on Saturday, Insulza said it is unlikely Pinochet 
could get a fair trial if the former dictator is extradited to Spain. 
``A fair trial on this issue in Spain would be difficult given the 
high level of emotion that this case has caused,'' Insulza said. ``I 
believe that Pinochet has already been tried and condemned in Spain.'' 
He said he will meet with Spanish officials about the extradition. 
``I am going to Spain to talk about the case, I hope to meet with 
everybody, here (in London) this was not possible, but I am not going 
to make any specific requests,'' Insulza said. Pinochet, who is sought 
by Spanish authorities on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism 
committed during his 17-year rule, remains under police guard at a 
London hospital, where he is recovering from back surgery. He was 
arrested by British police on Oct. 16. There was fresh evidence of 
strains in Chile's relations with Britain. The Ministry of Defense 
said it has canceled plans for the frigate HMS Sutherland to appear 
at a naval fair in the Chilean port of Valparaiso, and the Foreign 
Office said it was temporarily closing its consular office in the 
city. Four other British consulates and the embassy in Santiago remain 
open. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson ordered 
Pinochet to appear in court on Dec. 11 to hear Straw's decision, ``subject 
to any medical reports.'' Pinochet's supporters, including former 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, are pressing Straw to allow the 
general to return home on ``compassionate grounds'' because of his 
frail health and age. Human rights activists are urging the government 
to let the case make its way through the British courts. A Chilean 
government report says 3,197 people were murdered or disappeared at 
the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship, which 
began in 1973 when he overthrew President Salvador Allende. Allende 
died in the coup.
