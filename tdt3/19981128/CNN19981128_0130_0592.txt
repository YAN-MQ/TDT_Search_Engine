The FDA wants to require drugmakers to indicate dosage amounts for 
children. On Friday it announced new rules designed to give health 
care providers enough information to make them confident about prescribing 
those medicines for kids. The FDA now has the power to order testing 
on children to determine dosages for drugs already on the market. 
Currently, drugs are tested mostly on adults.
