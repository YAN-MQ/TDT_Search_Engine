For decades Switzerland has been a residence of choice for the world's 
richest people, offering privacy, a bit of skiing and not too much 
of a tax burden on the good old numbered bank account. The trial of 
Russian businessman Sergei Mikhailov, starting Monday, is the first 
major Swiss attempt to draw the line against Russians who obtained 
their wealth through organized crime. Russians who made their money 
in the heady post-Communist years have flocked to buy villas on the 
so-called Swiss Riviera of Lake Geneva around Montreux and to secure 
their fortunes in Swiss banks. Swiss officials say they don't have 
a breakdown of the Russians who have come to Switzerland since the 
fall of communism, but that they issued residence permits to 5,695 
former Soviets by the end of 1996, more than double the figure for 
1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed. Among the new residents, according 
to Jean Ziegler, an outspoken critic of the Swiss establishment, are 
top figures in the increasingly powerful Russian mafia. ``There are 
three stages of Russian mafia penetration,'' Ziegler, a university 
professor and member of parliament, told The Associated Press. ``When 
the Soviet Union broke up, Switzerland was the laundering place for 
immense fortunes. Then mafia leaders started sending their families 
to Switzerland, putting their children in expensive private schools. 
``Now we are in the third stage where some of the mafia dons are transferring 
their operational headquarters to Switzerland _ and that is deadly 
dangerous,'' Ziegler says. Geneva prosecutors say Mikhailov is head 
of the Moscow-based Solntsevskaya crime organization, linked to the 
worldwide network of the mafia godfather Vyacheslav Ivankov _ known 
as Yaponchik _ who was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in New 
York last year. Geneva prosecutors arrested Mikhailov more than two 
years ago on charges of money laundering and membership in a criminal 
organization, as well as violations of the strict Swiss property laws. 
The money-laundering charges, however, have been dropped because of 
the difficulty of obtaining evidence from Russia, Geneva officials 
said. Mikhailov maintains that he is an ordinary businessmen, though 
he admits to being ``very, very, very rich.'' Mikhailov faces a maximum 
of seven-and-a-half years in prison. While the 40-year-old has been 
held since his arrest in the prison of Champ-Dollon in Geneva, Swiss 
officials say that has done little to curb his activities. In March 
his Swiss lawyer was arrested after he was caught leaving the prison 
with letters from Mikhailov which had not passed through the censor. 
Although ostensibly letters to Mikhailov's mistress, they are, Geneva 
authorities claim, just one of the many ways in which Mikhailov has 
continued to run his organization from his prison cell. The prosecution's 
main witness is former Moscow police officer Nikolai Oporov. He resigned 
from his job and received political exile in Switzerland following 
threats to his life and is now under heavy guard pending the trial. 
Another probable prosecution witness, Vadim Rozenbaum, who was due 
to be interviewed by the investigating judge, will not be giving evidence 
_ he was assassinated in the Netherlands in July 1997. No one has 
ever been charged in the case. Rozenbaum headed a Soviet cooperative 
in the late 1980s, and Mikhailov spent 19 months in detention at the 
time on charges of extorting money from him, but the charges were 
dropped for lack of evidence. While Oporov is the only Russian enlisted 
for the prosecution, lawyers for Mikhailov are expected to call up 
to 25 Russians. A total of 90 witnesses have been called, so the trial 
is expected to last two weeks, longer than the usual three or four 
days typical in Switzerland. Ziegler says whatever the outcome of 
the Mikhailov trial, the only way to make a dent in the Russian mafia 
is to make sweeping changes to the banking system. ``Switzerland shouldn't 
allow the opening of Russian banks here, as more than 70 per cent 
are in the hands of the mafia, and we should be much more careful 
with residence permits,'' Ziegler said.
