Germany is whole and free. The Allied and Russian troops have long 
since left Berlin. Next year, with Poland's entry into NATO, the country 
will be surrounded by allies for the first time in its modern history, 
and the German parliament will return to the Reichstag. A cycle has 
been completed, it would seem, a chapter closed, 53 years after the 
fall of Hitler's Reich. And yet Germany is anything but tranquil at 
the dawn of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's rule. In recent weeks, 
a former president, leading writers and prominent Jews have been drawn 
into a fierce debate about the place of memory and the shame, if any, 
that young Germans should feel for the crimes of their forebears. 
Germany has broached such issues before, but in its scope, openness 
and vitriol, the discussion appears to be without precedent. Behind 
it lies a growing exasperation at what is seen by some as a commercial 
exploitation of the Holocaust. Also apparent are a thirst for normality 
in a society that has repeatedly tried to confront Auschwitz and anxiety 
over freedom of speech in what is an established democracy. ``Perhaps, 
in the long run, it is good that a debate has been engendered, however 
painful,'' said Fritz Stern, a history professor at Columbia University. 
``For always, beneath the surface, there has been the wish to be normal 
in Germany, the wish not to be reminded all the time.'' The controversy 
began in October when Martin Walser, a prominent writer, used an acceptance 
speech for Germany's top literary award to say something that he said 
made him ``tremble'' at his audacity: Auschwitz should not become 
a ``routine threat, a tool of intimidation, a moral cudgel or just 
a compulsory exercise.'' Nor, he added, should German shame be ``exploited 
for present purposes.'' Response was overwhelming and electric because 
the challenge came not from the rightist fringe but from a man of 
the intellectual and moral center. ``Mental arson,'' declared Ignatz 
Bubis, the leader of Germany's small but growing Jewish community, 
who accused Walser of encouraging neo-Nazi groups, stimulating a new 
intellectual nationalism and betraying the memory of Auschwitz. Rushing 
to Walser's defense, the writer Monika Maron said that he had not 
gone far enough. ``I, for my part, neither think nor feel that young 
Germans must carry the shame of their nation,'' she wrote in the newspaper 
Die Zeit. ``For me, young Germans are as little incriminated as young 
Danes or young French.'' She wondered how ``we can convince other 
countries of our normality if we ourselves deny that claim?'' Ms. 
Maron ended with a troubling confession: ``Now that I defend Walser, 
I am also trembling a little bit. Why? Where do I live that I am afraid 
even to say what I think?'' Ever since 1945, Germany has been a country 
where the voicing of nationalist, or even strongly patriotic, sentiment 
has been suspect, and freedom of expression in mainstream debate has 
not extended to questioning ``the exploitation'' of the Holocaust. 
Perhaps Germany is only now lifting the last taboos bequeathed by 
Hitler and going through the final throes of its confrontation with 
Hitler's Reich. After the death camps, after the destruction of European 
Jewry, Germany has more recently been dealing with the issues of slave 
labor at many of its corporations and the cooperation of many banks 
and insurance companies with the Nazis. ``The taboos have all been 
lifted at last, and the complicity of most sectors of German society 
revealed,'' said Arno Mayer, a historian at Princeton University. 
``But once you do that, of course, you want to move forward, get beyond 
it all.'' Yet, at the very moment when this desire to move on has 
apparently crystallized, the Holocaust has become more omnipresent 
than ever, brought to the public by the movie ``Schindler's List,'' 
popularized in American television series, argued over in claims against 
Swiss banks and used as a regular ingredient of New York politics. 
The Germans' growing belief that American popular culture has turned 
the Holocaust into the sole event of World War II and their sharpened 
desire to put a terrible century behind them seem to lie at the heart 
of the current furor. Walser was careful not to say who was doing 
the exploiting. But in another long defense of him, Klaus von Dohnanyi, 
a former mayor of Hamburg and a man whose own father was killed by 
the Nazis because of his acts of resistance, was explicit. He singled 
out U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who helped force the Swiss 
to settle Jewish claims, as an example of the ``political instrumentalization'' 
of the Holocaust, complained of a ``Holocaust industry'' and suggested 
that visitors to concentration camps today increasingly seemed driven 
by idle curiosity. ``Remembrance must not become comfortable routine,'' 
von Dohnanyi said. ``This is the danger Walser came out against.'' 
Von Dohnanyi also compared his own situation with that of Bubis, the 
Jewish leader. Relatives of both men were killed by the Nazis. Both 
bore no responsibility for these crimes. Yet, there the similarities 
ended. While Bubis was naturally, and rightfully, exonerated, von 
Dohnanyi felt compelled to accept the ``historic guilt'' of the Germans. 
This was naturally a difficult role, and von Dohnyanyi said Walser's 
speech should be seen as the ``complaint of a personally innocent 
German, who feels caught in the disgrace of crimes of preceding generations 
which he did not commit, but for which he nevertheless has to feel 
responsible. It was the understandable, even necessary complaint of 
a conscientious non-Jewish German about the difficult fate of being 
such a German today.'' But when, if ever, will that fate become a 
lighter one? Perhaps the very fact of so open a debate suggests a 
society that is opening up and outgrowing its fears. The resentments 
alluded to by Walser are widespread _ he has received enormous support 
_ and could grow sharper if the new government or the European Union 
fail to offer Germans the more unburdened identity they clearly crave. 
One man clearly worried is former President Richard von Weizsacker. 
Writing in the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung last week, he accused 
Walser of ``cutting provocation,'' warning that, ``It must not go 
on like this.'' The voice was authoritative but with a ring of the 
past. Germany seems to want to talk about its demons, once and for 
all.
