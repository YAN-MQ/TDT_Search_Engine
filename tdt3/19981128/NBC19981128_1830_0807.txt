Now to western Canada and the controversial case of a man who killed 
his disabled daughter in what many consider an act of mercy. NBC's 
Rehema Ellis has our report. Robert latimer, a farmer from saskatchewan, 
is at the center of canada's current "right to die" debate. In 1993, 
he killed his 12-year-old daughter, a life-long cerebral palsy patient, 
who required constant care and endured enormous pain. Easier for me 
to lay in a jail cell than it was for her to lay on a floor. Disabled 
rights activists all over Canada were outraged by the killing, especially 
because the child was not terminally ill. She was about to have surgery 
intended to reduce her discomfort. There is no mercy in killing someone 
who hasn't said they're ready to die. And Tracy never had the opportunity 
to say yes or no. Robert latimer was found guilty of second degree 
murder. When it came time to pronounce sentence, the judge ruled that, 
under the circumstances, the mandatory sentence of life in prison 
was inappropriate. The killing was done out of love, he said and handed 
down a sentence of just two years. Prosecutors appealed that original 
sentence, charging it was too lenient, and this week a higher court 
agreed, imposing the mandatory life sentence with no parole eligibility 
for at least ten years. Those who had been protesting are pleased. 
Everybody's lives should be protected the same, whether you have a 
Disability or not. Latimer's attorney is appealing to the Supreme 
Court. There is not a legal issue that we're not going to canvas in 
trying to prevent Bob latimer from spending the rest of his life in 
a penitentiary. The issue of mercy killing is as divisive in Canada 
as it is here. A newspaper poll last year found three out of four 
Canadians support the right of the terminally ill to die at a time 
of their own choosing. This spring, a member of Canada's parliament 
introduced a Bill to create an assisted suicide law, but the idea 
was overwhelmingly rejected. But debate on the topic continues, and 
Robert latimer remains free while the Canadian Supreme Court decides 
whether to hear his appeal. Rehema Ellis, NBC news.
