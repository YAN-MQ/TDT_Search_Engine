The White House says President Clinton will go to the Gaza strip next 
month to address the Palestinian national council. Officials say he'll 
also oversee the revocation of clauses in the PLO's charter that call 
for the destruction of Israel. The revocation was one key part of 
the interim accord signed in Maryland last month. Mr. Clinton is also 
scheduled to visit Israel and the West Bank.
