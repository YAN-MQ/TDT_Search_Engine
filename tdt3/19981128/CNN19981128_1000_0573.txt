Iraq is claiming deadly VX nerve gas was planted on one of its missile 
warheads, after it was taken away for testing by U.N. weapons inspectors. 
Iraq's deputy foreign minister has not identified who may have been 
responsible. But he says samples that inspectors found in may must 
have been deliberately contaminated. The charge came in letters sent 
to the U.N. yesterday that responded to questions about its chemical 
weapons program.
