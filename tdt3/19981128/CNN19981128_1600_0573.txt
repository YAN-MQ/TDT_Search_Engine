new federal information is challenging the notion stolen guns are 
the ones usually used in crimes. "the new york times" reports a bureau 
of alcohol, tobacco and firearms study shows nearly 40% of handguns 
used to commit crimes were purchased from federally licensed dealers. 
the numbers also contradict the gun industry's claim its dealers are 
not the source of an illegal black market for weapons. in just a few 
days, the brady gun control law is set to expire. it requires a five-day 
waiting period before buying a gun. that's being replaced by an instant 
criminal background check system november 30th.
