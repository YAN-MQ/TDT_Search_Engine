Turnout for registration for the 1999 elections has been very low, 
with problems persisting in the compilation of South Africa's first 
all-race voters list, officials said Saturday. Only slightly more 
than 235,000 of the 12.7 million eligible voters in the northern half 
of South Africa registered Friday, the first day of three days of 
registration for northern South Africa. The 12 million potential voters 
in the southern half of the country are to register next weekend. 
Hundreds of registration sites remained closed because civil servants 
were not showing up to staff them, and voters were still being directed 
to the wrong sites. Even President Nelson Mandela registered at the 
wrong site Friday. The Independent Electoral Commission repeated the 
error when it directed Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to the wrong voter 
registration point. The mistake was discovered in time and Mbeki will 
go to the proper site when he returns Sunday from a conference in 
Paris, said Thabo Masebe, spokesman for the ruling African National 
Congress. Many farmworkers and domestic workers could be excluded 
from voting in next year's election because they don't know they have 
to register. The South African Press Association reported that many 
of hundreds of laborers in North West Province who were preparing 
fields for planting said they were unaware they needed to register. 
IEC chief electoral officer Mandla Mchunu said he was not overly concerned 
about the low turnout for voter registrations. ``For the fact that 
we had quite a difficult start, the number doesn't depress me greatly,'' 
he told reporters. ``I did not expect five million on the first day.'' 
No date has been set yet for the 1999 election, the first since the 
1994 all-race balloting which marked the end of apartheid.
