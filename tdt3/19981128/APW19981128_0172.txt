The discovery of fossilized primate remains in a 40-million-year-old 
rock could lead to a better understanding of when man first appeared 
in Asia, members of a Myanmar-Japanese team said Saturday. The remains 
of the primates, with an upper jaw and teeth still intact, were found 
earlier this month in the Pondaung region of northwestern Myanmar, 
also known as Burma. Col. Than Tun, leader of the Myanmar team, told 
reporters the remains were a ``vital find,'' complementing the discovery 
at Pondaung last year of the left and right lower jaws of an amphipithecus 
primate. The latest finds were of pondaungia and amphipithecus primates, 
he said. Until the Pondaung findings, it was believed that primates 
from which man evolved first appeared in Southeast Asia at a later 
date. Scholars from the United States and France have also conducted 
surveys in the Pondaung region.
