The international space station needs a name, and a Russian TV network 
is inviting viewers to come up with one. Thousands have responded, 
and the entries reflect a wide variety of opinion about the multibillion-dollar 
project, not all of them positive. One viewer suggested calling the 
station, Armageddon. Others voted for such historical names as galileo 
and Columbus. And one person wants to name it mommy. Russia's space 
agency will submit its favorites to the other countries involved in 
the project.
