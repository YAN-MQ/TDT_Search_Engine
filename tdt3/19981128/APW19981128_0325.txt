Hundreds of elderly veterans of Romania's pro-Hitler Legion snapped 
a fascist salute and sang hymns in an icy oak grove near Bucharest 
Saturday to mark the 60th anniversary of their leader's death. Relatives 
and followers of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, known as ``the Captain,'' 
sponsored Saturday's gathering in the woods where Codreanu was executed 
some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Bucharest. It was the largest 
fascist turnout here since WWII. ``The Captain had a divine gift and 
he was respected for his honesty and his profound Orthodox faith,'' 
said Dumitru Tache Funda, 82, a former Legionnaire who knew Codreanu. 
About 300 people attended the gathering, conducted as a Christian 
Orthodox ceremony. Twelve teenagers dressed in green shirts, the traditional 
Legionnaire uniform, joined the ceremony, carrying green candles and 
flags. The Legion terrorized Romania during World War II and killed 
political leaders, including two premiers. Numbering as many as 1.5 
million, the Legionnaires tried to seize power in 1941 but their revolt 
was quelled. About 1,000 veteran Legionnaires are still honorary members 
of the group today. The Legion's youth wing has 70 members but many 
more sympathizers, a youth leader said. ``I became a Legionnaire because 
I respect the values promoted by its people, the truth and honesty, 
in a world marked by lies and corruption,'' said Iacob Bogdan, 21, 
a student in medicine. After years of oppression under the communists, 
who took power in 1946 in Romania and imprisoned tens of thousands 
of Legionnaires as anti-Soviet, the Legion's pre-WWII role is now 
being cast in a positive light. Until communism collapsed in 1989, 
mere mention of the movement was strictly forbidden and Romania's 
current constitution still outlaws communist and Legion organizations. 
Codreanu, a lawyer, led the Legion for 11 years until he was killed 
in 1938 on the orders of King Carol II. Carol's henchmen also killed 
three of Codreanu's brothers. Romania was allied with Nazi Germany 
during WWII until King Michael helped stage a coup against Antonescu 
in August 1944 taking Romania over to the Allies.
