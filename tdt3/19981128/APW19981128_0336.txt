Palestinians held wide-spread demonstrations, some of which turned 
violent, throughout the West Bank and east Jerusalem Saturday calling 
for the release of relatives and neighbors in Israeli jails. In east 
Jerusalem, Israeli police on horse-back fired rubber-coated bullets, 
tear gas and beat back a crowd of 450 Palestinian demonstrators in 
an effort to prevent the protesters from marching towards Jerusalem's 
walled Old City. Several Palestinians and journalists were injured 
from being clubbed by police. Israeli police said nine Palestinians 
were detained. In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, clashes erupted 
between Israeli soldiers and about 200 Palestinians who marched towards 
an Israeli army outpost and pelted soldiers who stones. Troops responded 
with tear gas and rubber-bullets before Palestinian police arrived 
on the scene and pushed their citizens back from the Israeli-controlled 
area. A group of Palestinians burned one Israeli flag. There were 
no injuries reported. In five other Palestinian-controlled cities 
throughout the West Bank, demonstrations were peaceful. Protesters 
called on Israel to set free so-called security prisoners, and lambasted 
the Palestinian leadership for not doing enough to secure the release 
of an estimated 2,500 Palestinians who remain in Israeli jails. ``We 
went out in the past to demonstrate against the Israelis to release 
our sons, but this time its different. There is an agreement. We came 
today to raise our voice to the Palestinian Authority to get the agreement 
implemented,'' said Khalid Abu Mihsin, whose son Jamal was sentenced 
to life in prison in 1993 for being part of a terror cell behind the 
murder of an Israeli. As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, 
Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinians in three stages. One week 
ago, Israel released the first group which included 150 common criminals, 
setting off criticism and disappointment from both the Palestinian 
public and officials who had expected the release of Palestinians 
held for political or militant activities. Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not release an prisoners who had 
committed murder or militant acts. The prisoner issue is a sensitive 
one for Palestinians since most families have had a brother of father 
arrested at one time or another during the 30 years of Israeli occupation 
and had hoped the peace process with Israel would mean the release 
of prisoners. A statement from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's 
Cabinet, which met until late Friday, said the issue of prisoner releases 
was ``top priority,'' and ``will not be subjected to compromise.'' 
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat would raise 
the issue with U.S. President Bill Clinton when he goes to Washington 
next week. At Saturday's demonstrations however, held under the banner 
``no peace without prisoner release,'' most of the anger was lobbed 
at Arafat's Palestinian Authority and in some cases, at Erekat directly. 
In the city of Nablus, some 250 Palestinian demonstrators including 
mothers of prisoners carrying photos of their sons, chanted, ``Tell 
Erekat we are fed up with statements.'' Similar protests were held 
in the Gaza Strip last week and Palestinians said weekly demonstrations 
would grow until all prisoners were released.
