Stephen K-M Tim, a botanist and illustrator who was a guiding force 
for many of the exhibits and publications of the Brooklyn Botanic 
Garden, died on Nov. 21 at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. 
He was 61 and lived in Brooklyn. Tim, who was the garden's vice president 
for science, library and publications, died of cardiac arrest, garden 
officials said. Born and reared in South Africa, Tim got his start 
at the garden in part through a fortunate coincidence. Elizabeth Scholtz, 
who as director hired him 27 years ago, said that at the time, garden 
officials were looking for an assistant horticultural taxonomist, 
someone who was supposed to know everything about everything. Tim 
was a mycologist, a specialist in mushrooms, and did not seem to fit 
the bill. But Ms. Scholtz was a fellow South African, and looked more 
closely at his resume. ``I noticed that he came from Rhodes University, 
which had a fine reputation for general botany,'' said Ms. Scholtz, 
now the garden's director emeritus. South African botanists, she added, 
``learned our taxonomy before we learned anything else.'' Tim got 
the job. Sir Ghillean Prance, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens 
at Kew in England, said that a taxonomist's role at a botanical garden 
is seemingly simple, yet crucial. ``You need someone who can reliably 
identify the plants you are growing,'' he said. But because a taxonomist 
has a science background, he can help with interpretation, Prance 
said. That is exactly what Tim did. After two years he was named curator 
of the herbarium, and a year later created the first of many exhibits, 
on insect-eating plants. Later, he was involved in creating a garden 
for the disabled, and in renovating the Shakespeare garden. His most 
significant achievement was the conception of exhibits at the Steinhardt 
Conservatory in the mid-1980s, including a ``Trail of Evolution'' 
that traces plants through the ages. Tim was also a skilled illustrator 
whose work appeared in The New York Times and in many of the garden's 
books and newsletters, which are among the most popular botanical 
publications in the world. His drawing skills were self-taught (he 
made his first study at age 4 while sick with the measles), and were 
no doubt aided by his skills as a taxonomist, said Judith Zuk, president 
of the garden. ``Observation is so critical in taxonomy,'' Ms. Zuk 
said. ``From a botanical illustration standpoint, this made him particularly 
fine.'' Tim was an expert on poisonous plants, and served as an emergency 
contact for poison control centers and hospitals around the country. 
Tim is survived by his wife, Nancy Shopis Tim; a sister, Phonyim Tim, 
of Victoria, British Columbia; a brother, Peter, of Johannesburg, 
and three nephews.
