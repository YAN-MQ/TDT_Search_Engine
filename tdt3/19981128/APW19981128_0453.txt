A Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer had her right leg amputated 
after she was wounded in a shootout with a man who later killed himself, 
police said Saturday. The wounded 27-year-old woman was among three 
officers dispatched to a townhouse near Vancouver on Friday to investigate 
a report of alleged sex offenses. After she was shot, she was rushed 
to Vancouver General Hospital, where doctors tried unsuccessfully 
to save her leg. Other officers surrounded the townhouse, waiting 
for the gunman to surrender. Late Friday, officers heard a single 
gunshot. They entered the building two hours later and found the lone 
male occupant dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Sgt. Russ 
Grabb. Names of the dead man and the wounded officer were being withheld 
until their families could be notified, Grabb said.
