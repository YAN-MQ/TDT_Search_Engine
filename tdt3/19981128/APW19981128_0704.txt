Speculation increased Saturday that the most influential person in 
Sudan's government, parliamentary Speaker Hassan Turabi, would be 
leaving his post. The president's legal adviser, Abdel-Basit Sabdarat, 
said his chief would not ``intervene in the selection'' of a new speaker, 
the official news agency SUNA reported. Sabdarat did not say whether 
Turabi was leaving. The government newspaper Al-Anbaa said Tuesday 
that Turabi would be retiring as speaker to give more time to the 
National Congress, which is effectively the ruling party. Turabi has 
not commented on the report, but earlier this year he expressed a 
desire to leave Parliament. Turabi is widely regarded as the principal 
ideologue of the military-backed government of President Omar el-Bashir. 
His departure from the speakership is not expected to reduce his role 
as the power behind the scenes. Al-Anbaa said Turabi would announce 
his resignation before a new law that legalizes ``political associations'' 
takes effect on Jan. 1. El-Bashir's government dissolved all political 
parties after it seized power in 1989.
