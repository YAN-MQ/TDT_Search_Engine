Tania Aebi, once the youngest person to sail alone around the world, 
is 30-something now. But in spirit she is still the same spunky, outspoken 
teen-ager who left a bicycle messenger job in New York City to go 
cruising in exotic places. In the last decade, she has become a housewife, 
a student and a mother in rural Vermont and still she sails the world. 
``Life goes so fast,'' Aebi said in a recent telephone interview from 
her home in Corinth, Vt. ``But it's still so much fun.'' And why not? 
As co-partner in Tania Aebi's Sailing Adventures, the 32-year-old 
now organizes trips for women who want to learn more about sailing 
by going on extended cruises. Aebi and her partner, Jill London, of 
Key West, Fla., have a trip lined up Feb. 8-18 in the Seychelles, 
an island chain in the Indian Ocean. And from May 15-25, their two 
sailboats will accommodate about 12 women on a cruise around Greece, 
an island a day. Each trip costs $1,995 a person, plus air fare. The 
cruise to the Seychelles is already fully booked. For Aebi, the voyages 
offer some quiet personal time on the water. Her life is otherwise 
hectic as the mother of two small children, ages 5 and 7, and as a 
student in an adult writing program at Vermont College in Montpelier. 
The allure of setting out to sea still captivates the more mature 
but ever-wistful Aebi. At 18, she set out to sea alone with a pittance 
of nautical savvy on a boat offered by her father with the unorthodox 
challenge to sail the world. By age 21, when she returned to New York 
Harbor, Aebi had garnered enough life experiences to fill a book. 
Her 1989 account, ``Maiden Voyage,'' written with Bernadette Brennan 
Bernon, editorial director of Cruising World magazine, told the story 
of a 27,000-mile saga by a stubborn young girl with little experience 
at sea or with life. The book pointed out that, in the end, Aebi unintentionally 
compromised her status as a lone circumnavigator. By delivering an 
acquaintance from one small island to another during the voyage, she 
had not been alone after all. Still, the 80-mile glitch on her 26-foot 
sailboat has not spoiled the memories. ``I'm really happy that I did 
it,'' Aebi said about the global trip. ``It was like a dream. At the 
time, I didn't realize that; it was more like a job. But I learned 
a lot of things. When I got back into society, I realized that self-reliance 
and self-accountability are not that important to people.'' Aebi is 
now capitalizing on the idea of taking other women sailing. The concept 
of sailing schools for women became popular in the mid-1980s when 
women made it clear they wanted to learn outside of the male shadow. 
More often than not when they went sailing with men, they found themselves 
relegated to cooking in the galley rather than trimming sails on the 
foredeck, and they wanted out of the male tutorials. Women seem to 
be dropping that kind of segregated outlook somewhat now that more 
of them are comfortable at the helm, Doris Colgate, president of the 
National Women's Sailing Association, said recently. As founder of 
the nonprofit sailing group, Colgate sent a questionnaire to 1,000 
former boating students. The majority of the women said it was time 
to move on from much of the instructional isolation. ``Many did not 
feel that women's classes were that important because it isn't the 
real world,'' Colgate said. For the early stages of sailboat instruction, 
however, women continue to ask about special classes where they can 
learn among themselves, Colgate added. Aebi agrees there is a need. 
She is not opposed to men on some of her group's voyages. ``It isn't 
boot camp,'' Aebi said. ``The women we have taken on trips can learn 
as much as they want. It's about getting familiar with living aboard 
a boat. Slowly, everything comes together. It's about navigation and 
sail handling, cooking, engine and boat maintenance, anchoring and 
docking.'' A favorite maneuver for Aebi is when a boatload of women 
comes into the dock at some foreign port. Men along the waterfront 
tend to snicker as if the worst is about to happen, she said, adding: 
``But we always do it right. Those guys are waiting for us to mess 
up. But we don't. I love that time the best.'' Information on Tania
