Thousands marched Saturday through this northern city demanding an 
end to the government policy of keeping imprisoned members of the 
armed Basque separatist group ETA in jails far from their families 
in the northern Basque region. The demonstrators, many linked to pro-independence 
political parties and social groups, held placards displaying black 
and white photos of prisoners. The fate of ETA's 535 prisoners is 
at the center of the fledgling peace process ushered in by an ETA 
cease-fire in place since Sept. 18. But while there have been moves 
towards peace talks over the past two months, ETA has demanded a change 
in prison policy before going to the table while the government has 
insisted that negotiations cannot begin until the group renounces 
violence forever. ``We are not yet convinced that ETA has given up 
violence for good, so the government will not be doing anything new 
in terms of prison policy,'' Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said 
on national radio. ETA is a Basque-language acronym that stands for 
Basque Homeland and Freedom. Its bombing and shooting campaign in 
favor of a Basque homeland straddling parts of northern Spain and 
southern France began in 1968 and has left nearly 800 people dead. 
Earlier Saturday in the nearby Basque city of San Sebastian victims 
of the violence presented a document complaining that they were not 
being taken into account in the peace process. ``The victims are being 
asked to be generous, to forgive and forget, but the assassins are 
not being forced to seek forgiveness for their crimes,'' the document 
said according to the state-owned news agency EFE. There was also 
anger at being ``abandoned'' by religious and state institutions, 
``Every victim has a horror story to tell, not just about the terrorists,'' 
EFE quoted the document as staying. The document was signed by about 
220 victims, or relatives of the victims, of the violence, and named 
ETA as the major culprit but also cited the Anti-Terrorist Liberation 
Groups, or GAL. The GAL was a government-linked death squad that killed 
27 people between 1983 and 1987 in a bid to quash ETA. Many of its 
victims were mistaken targets.
