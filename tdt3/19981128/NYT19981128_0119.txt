This city has never really loved them, not the way Cleveland used 
to love its Browns, when it had them, or the way Pittsburgh loves 
the Steelers, and certainly not the way Green Bay loves its Packers. 
But then, as the cliche goes, it is easy to love a winner, even if 
the trophies have dust on them. But Atlanta has never loved its often-disappointing 
Falcons even as much as New Orleans loves its often-hapless Saints 
or as much as Massachusetts loves its Patriots, even as they prepare 
to move to, of all places, Connecticut. So, when this city shows even 
a little love for a team that is all of a sudden off to its best start 
in franchise history, when fans cross their fingers and whisper, ``Super 
Bowl,'' with that faraway hope some people have of finding buried 
treasure or winning the lottery, it is news. ``I was at the mall with 
my daughter, taking her shopping, and I saw our jerseys in the front 
window of a store,'' said Charley Taylor, the Falcons' director of 
public relations for the last 12 years. ``First time I've seen that.'' 
Usually, Taylor said, the jerseys are from the Georgia Bulldogs or 
the Atlanta Braves or someone, anyone, but the Falcons, whose franchise 
record over 33 years was, at the end of last season, a sad 182 wins, 
293 losses and five ties, among the worst in the league. But 1998 
has been magic. Going into this weekend, the Falcons, with nine victories 
and two losses, are at the top of their division, the West, in the 
National Football Conference. ``It's fun,'' Taylor said. And slowly, 
tentatively, people are beginning to hope, to believe, even to cut 
loose and dance a little. A thing called the ``Dirty Bird,'' kind 
of a cross between the Funky Chicken, and well, something else, is 
all the rage. The Falcons do it when they score a touchdown, and even 
a few people in the stands do it. It is not pandemonium. It is not 
a town going wild, people here say. Atlanta is not like Pittsburgh, 
where real steelworkers come and cheer their Steelers. It is a corporate 
town, powered by big banks, Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola, by women and 
men in suits who, more often than not, came here from someplace else, 
who arrive at Atlanta Braves baseball games three innings late and 
leave in the seventh, to dodge traffic, and really do read The Wall 
Street Journal during the game. ``We have so many people that are 
from other states,'' said Barbara Sanders, who, along with her husband, 
John, has been a Falcons season-ticket holder for almost a quarter-century. 
``I've recently undergone some chemotherapy, and my doctor is a Jets 
fan. I had to go to the eye doctor recently, and a woman there is 
a Pittsburgh Steelers fan. People here will say they'll pull for the 
Falcons, if their team isn't playing.'' The 62-year-old Mrs. Sanders, 
who said she was feeling much better and hoped she had beaten back 
her cancer, said she would go to the games as long as she was able, 
``even if I have to wear a wig.'' But she is a little disgusted, sometimes, 
at how delicate some Falcons fans can be. ``I sat near a woman who 
had cotton stuffed in her ears'' because she thought the fans yelled 
too loud, Mrs. Sanders said. ``That made me yell even louder. If you're 
going to go to the game and sit on your hands, then go and watch `The 
Nutcracker' or something.'' The people who have come to Atlanta have 
come to live not so much in a city as in the vicinity of one. Atlanta 
is not one city but several, with neighborhoods of people who consider 
themselves Atlantans stretching as far as 20 miles away, commuting 
on often-packed freeways, as new residents distance themselves from 
the poorer city center. But the Falcons, Taylor said, have the power 
to unify the city, simply by winning. He has seen it before, when 
he worked with the Washington Redskins in the early 1980s, the championship 
years. ``All races, all cultures feel a part of it'' when a team starts 
winning, Taylor said. ``Few things can cause that kind of crossover.'' 
The Falcons have always been more of a blue-collar draw than the Braves, 
and have always drawn more black fans. But they have seldom won, though 
they have often teased. Year after year, except when the losses piled 
up so high that even the optimistic fans could not see over them, 
the Falcons have won just often enough to get people's hopes up, fans 
here say. Even with talk of a Super Bowl berth beginning to hum around 
the city, many people here are still reluctant to dream. ``After years 
of not getting what you have expected, you still might not be sure 
that you want to put everything that you have into it'' emotionally, 
Taylor said. But, he said, it is fun to dream, and to see, week after 
week, that dream take firmer form. Mrs. Sanders is already planning 
a trip to Miami, to the Super Bowl. Joe Albright, who works in sales 
for an Atlanta company, has been a season ticket-holder since the 
beginning. ``I have never given up,'' he said. ``I stick to the last 
play of the last game. My wife gets frustrated with me.'' But Albright 
is pragmatic. He does not expect miracles. He expected this team to 
be good, but perhaps not this good. ``I am cautiously optimistic,'' 
he said. Still, even at 9-2 with one of the best records in football, 
the Falcons do not sell out their stadium, causing local blackouts 
of televisions games; teams that do not sell out are often blacked 
out. ``Fans are so fickle,'' Albright said. But these players, he 
said, have something worth watching, something football fans respect: 
Guts. ``In the past, if they got their butts kicked they just laid 
down,'' and by the start of the second half the fans could tell a 
game was already over, Albright said. ``You don't see that happening 
now.'' If only, Mrs. Sanders said, the fans could mirror that. ``It's 
really, really easy to like a team when it's winning,'' she said. 
And now, they are.
