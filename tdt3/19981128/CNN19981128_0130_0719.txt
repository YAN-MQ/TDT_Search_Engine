There's no more listening in on the cops. Several U.S. cities are 
adopting new police scanners that would scramble the transmitting 
signal making home scanners obsolete. Many police departments think 
the current scanners leak sensitive information. Nashville, Tennessee, 
is spending $35 million to get the new system up and running by the 
year 2000. Honolulu and Des Moines, Iowa, are among the cities that 
have made the switch.
