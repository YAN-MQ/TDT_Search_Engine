Darlington Castle was like a lover Donald Lehman thought he could 
change: He coveted it despite its obvious flaw. The elegant turn-of-the-century 
stone mansion with its long, winding drive, oak-paneled drawing rooms 
and view clear to the World Trade Center, seems to sit on the top 
of the Earth. But the castle also has a working radio tower mounted 
to its roof and an iron-clad lease that insures it will remain there 
until 2006. Lehman, who owns an alarm company, and his wife, Barbara, 
a retired chemistry teacher, bought Darlington Castle and more than 
30 acres of hillside for $1.5 million in 1993, substantially less 
than similar houses in the area cost. In this town of old money, new 
celebrity and sprawling estates 40 miles north of midtown Manhattan, 
there were few other takers for a house with a 20-foot antenna that 
broadcasts ``smooth jazz'' 24 hours a day to northern Westchester. 
``All I could think about was the house,'' said Lehman, who first 
visited it in 1983 when he tried to sell the previous owners an alarm 
from his company, Attack Cat Security. ``It was my dream house. The 
minute I saw it, I said, `I want this house.' '' Although the Lehmans 
knew what they were getting into, they now complain that Kenny G has 
become the soundtrack to their lives and that the station, WZZN at 
106.3 FM, comes through on every channel on the radio dial, meddles 
with their television reception, interrupts their fax machine and 
interferes with their business equipment. Lehman attributes his headaches 
to microwave radiation from the tower and the couple say the tower 
is ill-maintained, causing their roof to leak and bathroom ceiling 
to collapse. The station's owners see things differently. ``His claims 
range from false to largely exaggerated,'' said Robert Davis, the 
lawyer for WZZN, which is owned by Westchester Radio LLC. ``Our client, 
to buy some peace, has made many offers to accommodate him,'' Davis 
said. The station has installed cable television in five of the house's 
17 rooms and pays the bill for the service (about $100 a month). The 
station has given the Lehmans two interference-free radios, two digital 
answering machines and offered to pay half the cost of a new roof. 
The station is obligated to pay about $5,000 a year in rent. It has 
offered to increase the rent to $18,000, Davis said, and to install 
cable television in the three-bedroom pool house. ``And by the way,'' 
Davis said. ``He paid $1.5 million for a house that's probably worth 
6 or 7 million.'' Yet the Lehmans are determined to be rid of the 
antenna. They have been arrested once for tampering with the transmitting 
equipment. They have paid a $12,000 settlement to the radio company 
and lost two court cases and an appeal to the Federal Communications 
Commission to get rid of the antenna. A state Supreme Court judge 
issued an injunction this summer to prevent them from touching the 
equipment. They have been through four sets of lawyers; the last ones 
resigned a few weeks ago, after the Lehmans let it be known that they 
planned to tear the antenna down. ``I'll represent myself,'' Lehman 
said. ``I'm doing it my way. It's time to have a Boston Tea Party.'' 
The battle seems to be just another chapter in their home's colorful 
history. Charles Darlington Jr., an economist and diplomat whose father 
built Darlington Castle in 1904, fell upon hard times in 1966. Neighbors 
say he lost all his money in a bad investment. To generate enough 
income to keep the drafty castle in the family, he sold off property 
and granted a 40-year lease to Martin Stone for the tower. Stone, 
who died in June, was the producer of ``Howdy Doody'' and a pioneer 
in community radio. A lawyer by training, he drafted a lease that 
has remained valid even though the castle has changed ownership twice 
and the radio station has changed ownership four times. ``It was a 
lease that was so one-sided that no one but a desperate man would 
sign it,'' Lehman said. It turned the house into a white elephant. 
``A lot of buyers came to see it but nobody wanted that house,'' said 
Sally Siano, a real estate agent in Bedford Hills who remembered when 
the house went on the market in the early 1990s for more than $5 million. 
``Every client I ever brought there would not even consider living 
in it because of the electric fields and their concern for their health,'' 
she said. Joy Schieffelin and her late husband, William Jay Schieffelin 
III, a wine and spirit importer, bought Darlington Castle in 1975. 
Like Lehman, Schieffelin was enamored with the castle and its views. 
All the static that came through their television, radios and stereo 
couldn't convince Schieffelin to move, his wife said, though she was 
never comfortable there. ``The lease was absolutely tight,'' Mrs. 
Schieffelin said sadly. ``There was nothing we could do about it. 
I don't know why we stayed there except my husband loved that castle.'' 
Mrs. Schieffelin was friendly with Lehman, who regularly serviced 
her security alarm. She knew how much Lehman wanted the house and 
said that she warned him before he bought the property that the lease 
was unbreakable. ``He said, `Don't worry, I'll get rid of that antenna,''' 
Mrs. Schieffelin recalled in a telephone conversation. ``I said, `No, 
you won't.' And he said, `Oh yes, I will.'''
