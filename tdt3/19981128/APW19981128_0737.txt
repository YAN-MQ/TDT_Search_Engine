French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday that France will 
create a centralized body to investigate restitution claims from heirs 
and descendants of Jews whose property was confiscated during World 
War II. Jospin told Jewish leaders that the government would put an 
additional 10 million francs (dlrs 1.75 million) to boost staff working 
on satisfying individual slaims. ``For France, it's a question of 
learning from its history and of making reparations where necessary,'' 
Jospin told the annual dinner hosted by the Representative Council 
of French Jewish Institutions, (CRIF). Fifty-three years after the 
close of the war, France is still plagued by accusations that it is 
hesitant to face its pro-Nazi collaborationist past. Jospin denied 
suggestions that a government-appointed commission of experts investigating 
the widespread, systematic plundering of Jewish property met resistance 
from French banks and insurance companies thought to hold unclaimed 
Jewish assets. ``The deliberate discreet nature of its work should 
not mask the scale and quality of the results it has already achieved 
thanks to the active participation of the state agencies concerned,'' 
Jospin said. Jospin said the commission would complete its probe by 
the end of 1999. He said a French delegation of officials and experts 
would attend the meeting in Washington D.C. that starts Monday on 
looted Jewish assets. He praised France's national museum authority 
for doing its utmost to track down the owners or heirs of some 2,000 
pieces of unclaimed art in its possession. Jospin also announced a 
50 million franc grant (dlrs 8.7 million) to transform the Memorial 
to the Jewish Martyr in central Paris into a ``genuine holocaust museum,'' 
complete with a wall listing the names of the 76,000 Jews deported 
from France to Hitler's death camps. Only 2,500 survived. France recently 
pledged 20 million francs (dls 3.5 million) to an international fund 
to compensate victims of Nazi persecution. Jospin said the decision 
did not ``extinguish France's responsibility to compensate French 
victims of their families today.'' Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld called 
Jospin's proposals very positive. ``I only hope that the funds will 
go to the real victims of wartime persecution, that is the children 
who lost both parents, who grew up without affection and financial 
support and who today are elderly and poor.''
