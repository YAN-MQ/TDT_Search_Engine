A court hearing is scheduled today for a Wisconsin woman jailed on 
suspicion of child neglect. Wednesday, Karen kuffer brought her 15-year-old 
daughter to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival. 
Authorities say the girl, who had cerebral palsy, weighed only 15 
pounds. The girl's grandmother says she was about the size of a 6-year-old 
child. She says she repeatedly told the girl's mother to take her 
to the hospital but she would not. I told her, "you got to feed her." 
I said, "if you want her on earth you've got to feed her and keep 
her up." What did she say? She didn't say anything. She wouldn't say 
much. I said, "Karen, you've got a daughter here. You've got to take 
care of her if you want her to live." One nutritionist says even a 
6-year-old should weight at least 35 pounds.
