Residents of Appalachia, one of the poorest areas of the United States, 
are more likely to die from heart disease than people living elsewhere, 
a new study by researchers at West Virginia University has found. 
The authors of the 100-page report, ``Heart Disease in Appalachia: 
An Atlas of County Economic Conditions, Mortality and Medical Care 
Resources,'' say that a lack of medical facilities throughout the 
region and a lack of emphasis on good nutrition and exercise contribute 
to a higher level of heart problems in Appalachia. Elizabeth Barnett, 
an assistant professor at the West Virginia University school of medicine 
who led the study group, said researchers found that white Appalachians 
between ages 35 and 64 had a 15 percent to 20 percent greater chance 
of dying from heart disease than white Americans living elsewhere. 
Researchers also found that although heart disease deaths declined 
nationally and in Appalachia, they declined less in Appalachia. The 
study found that heart disease death rates among Appalachian blacks, 
who tend to live in urban areas, especially in Alabama and Mississippi, 
were closer to national averages. Ms. Barnett also said that because 
of Appalachia's poor economic conditions, the sparsely populated communities 
common to the area are less likely to provide residents recreational 
facilities and more healthful foods that are routinely available in 
more densely populated areas. ``We see this as a resource to be used 
to implement programs and policies to prevent heart disease,'' she 
said in an interview. ``By identifying how the area counties in the 
area compare to each other, we hope it will be useful to policy-makers.'' 
Appalachia sweeps southwest from western New York state deep into 
the South, to include 399 counties in 13 states. It has historically 
reflected problems of the rural poor, especially those whose livelihoods 
come from small family farms and coal mining. Only in recent years 
has the region begun to diversify, with many states seeking new industries, 
like timber, tourism, technology and automobile parts plants. But 
many bad physical and nutritional habits persist, leading to coronary 
disease and death. Ms. Barnett, who has taught at the university for 
three years, said the researchers tracked trends in heart disease 
and cardiac-related deaths from 1980 through 1993. She said they discovered 
the highest mortality rates in middle Appalachia _ central West Virginia, 
eastern Kentucky, western Virginia and northern Tennessee _ a region 
where coal once ruled but that now suffers from high unemployment, 
low income and limited availability of medical care. The research 
also found that the region lacked resources to aid people who have 
experienced heart disease and would benefit from exercise and nutritional 
programs and stress management classes. ``A majority of counties in 
Appalachia do not have cardiac rehabilitation units or coronary care 
units,'' Ms. Barnett said. ``Half of all initial heart attacks are 
fatal, so for those who survive, they still have a high risk for a 
second one.'' The report is scheduled to be published Monday in the 
Centers for Disease Control's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
