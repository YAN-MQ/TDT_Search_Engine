In his three years serving President Clinton as staff trouble shooter 
and campaign financing strategist, Harold Ickes became enough of a 
lightning rod that he had to undergo 26 separate sessions of questioning 
under oath by investigators of the Republican-controlled Congress 
and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. A scathingly wry and combative 
partisan strategist, Ickes always claimed to take it in stride as 
a part of the ``gotcha'' investigatory culture of modern Washington 
politics. ``What they're trying to do is catch you in a perjury charge,'' 
he said three years ago after the first dozen of his sessions with 
investigators. ``And then they try to squeeze you.'' Now, having weathered 
thousands of questions and amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in legal bills, Ickes, the former White House deputy chief of staff, 
finds fate and fortune hinging on one single, brief response he offered 
to a question in one of his 26 bouts of testimony. ``What did the 
administration do regarding the Diamond Walnut strike?'' he was asked 
on Sept. 22, 1997, on the third day of private deposition that preceded 
another Ickes session of public testimony before the Senate governmental 
Affairs Committee. ``Nothing that I know of,'' Ickes responded about 
a long-running Teamsters strike at Diamond Walnut Growers, a California 
agricultural cooperative. His questioners thereupon moved to other 
topics. With that scrap of colloquy, the stage has been set Monday 
for a decision by Attorney General Janet Reno on whether to accede 
to the demands of administration critics and the recommendations of 
some of her own advisers and seek the appointment of an independent 
counsel _ the eighth in the life of the Clinton administration _ to 
look into whether Ickes committed perjury. Last Tuesday, Reno rejected 
a separate independent counsel recommendation in the case of Vice 
President Al Gore's 1996 fund-raising activities. She has another 
recommendation pending for a broad independent counsel inquiry into 
whether Clinton violated the law in spending re-election money. There 
is concern in some Democratic circles that while Reno most likely 
will spare the president another independent counsel vetting, this 
might leave Ickes more vulnerable in a relentlessly political year 
for targeting as ``the administration scapegoat,'' in the words of 
one of his friends. In October, a House panel investigating the Teamsters 
union sought to build the case against Ickes by disclosing White House 
documents detailing his efforts to resolve the Diamond dispute in 
1995, when the re-election campaign was warming up and Ickes was intent 
on enlisting the support of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters 
and other major unions. After meeting with Teamsters officials, Ickes 
reached out to Mickey Kantor, then the U.S. trade representative, 
to persuade him to intervene in behalf of the striking Teamsters, 
the documents disclosed. Kantor told Congress that he eventually telephoned 
Diamond Walnut but for nothing more than a ``benign'' status inquiry 
about the prospects for a settlement. There was no pressure applied 
for a settlement, Kantor testified. An official of the company, whose 
potential business includes export markets, testified that ``there 
was absolutely no explicit threat,'' but that the phone call was received 
as a significant part of the Teamster effort ``to bring us to our 
knees.'' Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., who has been investigating 
the Teamsters, contends that Ickes deserves prosecution for perjury. 
The lawmaker says that Ickes perpetrated what the Justice Department 
terms ``The I Don't Remember Syndrome'' of misleading questioners 
by not disclosing all he might have recalled in response to the question 
of ``what did the administration do regarding'' the strike. To the 
contrary, Ickes' lawyers insist his answer was more than defensible 
considering how isolated and ambiguous the question was. They argue 
that Clinton administration officials only made inquiries and did 
not take concrete action _ did not ``do'' anything _ to press for 
an ending to the strike. Moreover, lawyers for Ickes note that the 
issue was never followed up by additional questions in the deposition, 
nor in the public testimony that followed, despite legal precedents 
in perjury cases emphasizing the need for adequate follow-up to ``fundamentally 
ambiguous'' questions. One Ickes brief cites a Supreme Court ruling 
that ``the burden is on the questioner to pin the witness down to 
the specific object of the questioner's inquiry.'' Robert Bennett, 
Ickes' lawyer, said: ``We hope there'll be no referral by the attorney 
general. It would be a terrible injustice in light of the facts and 
under the law to do so.'' The typically hard-nosed Ickes has described 
campaign financing by both parties as a shocking, ``demeaning,'' but 
technically legal scandal. The law merits reform, he says, yet is 
unlikely to be changed unless an illegal scandal on the order of Watergate 
arouses the public. ``We did what the law allowed,'' he told earlier 
investigators last year. As he awaits the attorney general's decision, 
Ickes, now a 59-year-old lawyer and business consultant, has declined 
all news interviews. Three years ago, he described himself as ``seared'' 
by all his subpoenaed appearances, but certainly braced for more.
