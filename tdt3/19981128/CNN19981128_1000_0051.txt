Police in Seattle are trying to figure out why a passenger shot the 
driver of a city bus, setting off a terrifying chain of events. The 
bus tumbled about 50 feet off a bridge yesterday when the driver lost 
control after being shot. It plowed through a guard rail on the Aurora 
bridge and smashed into a two story apartment building. The bus driver 
was thrown from the bus and killed. One passenger died of a gunshot 
wound to the head and at least 30 others on the bus were injured, 
some seriously. No one on the ground was hurt. Witnesses say they 
heard a loud boom and then ran for their lives. It was kind of slow 
motion, loud noise, things flying, didn't hear anything. Then when 
it hit, I heard a loud thump, then it was silent. Authorities say 
they're treating the shooting as a homicide. They say there was only 
one gunman and he was among the injured taken to the hospital.
