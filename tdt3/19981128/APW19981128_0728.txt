The British government on Saturday night was close to a deal that 
would send Gen. Augusto Pinochet home to Chile to stand trial there, 
two newspapers reported in Sunday editions. Citing unnamed government 
sources, the Sunday Telegraph and The Observer reported that the compromise 
deal is seen as the best way to avoid the diplomatic and economic 
consequences of allowing the 83-year-old former dictator to be extradited 
to Spain to stand trial on charges including genocide and murder. 
It would solve the dilemma facing Home Secretary Jack Straw, who would 
never be forgiven by some sections of his Labor Party if he allowed 
Pinochet to escape prosecution, and would keep trade relations with 
Chile from being damaged, the newspapers said. Straw has until Dec. 
11 to decide whether to extradite Pinochet. The government faced continuing 
pressure from Chile Saturday to let the former dictator come home. 
``The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide how they 
are going to deal with their past,'' Chilean Foreign Minister Jose 
Miguel Insulza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. 
``These processes are going on and I fully expect they will result 
in justice.'' Fourteen lawsuits were already pending in Chile, and 
Chilean legal experts believe an extradition request by Chile should 
take precedence over those from Spain or other European nations who 
also want to try Pinochet, because he is a Chilean and the alleged 
crimes were committed in Chile. Trying Pinochet, 5th graf pvs.
