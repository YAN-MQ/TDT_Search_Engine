Japan and South Korea signed an agreement Saturday that sets new fishing 
boundaries and quotas, easing tensions over rights to waters around 
disputed islands. The pact permits vessels from Japan and South Korea 
to fish within 200 nautical miles (230 miles, 370 kilometers) of each 
country's shores _ the limit for exclusive fishing rights under the 
1994 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. Japan and South Korea 
are less than 400 nautical miles (460 miles, 740 kilometers) apart 
and both had claimed exclusive rights in overlapping areas. The two 
nations agreed to set up a joint fishing zone around disputed islets, 
located about 35 nautical miles (40 miles, 64 kilometers) from the 
shores of both countries. The islets, called Takeshima in Japan and 
Tok-do in Korea, are surrounded by fertile fishing grounds and have 
been the source of persistent acrimony between the two countries. 
The signing during a meeting of Cabinet ministers from both countries 
in the southern city of Kagoshima, formalized the accord reached in 
September, a Japanese government official said. Kagoshima is 985 kilometers 
(616 miles) southwest of Tokyo on Japan's southernmost main island. 
Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura and his Korean counterpart 
Hong Soon-young inked the agreement in a ceremony also attended by 
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and South Korean Prime Minister 
Kim Jong-pil. Tempers flared between the neighbors in January after 
Japan said it wanted out of a 1965 treaty that had set exclusive fishing 
rights within 12 nautical miles (14 miles, 22 kilometers). Under the 
new accord, both sides also agreed to reduce their fishing catches 
in each other's waters.
