I go to work, and I feel trapped in Bill Clinton's libido. I go to 
the movies, and I feel trapped in Woody Allen's libido. Neither place 
is a pretty place to be. Hoping that everyone would be too stupefied 
from overeating to pay any attention, the president snuck out the 
answers to Henry Hyde's 81 ``admit or deny'' questions on Friday. 
His answers about the Lewinsky affair were crisp, unambiguous and 
revealing. He finally stepped up to the plate and accepted responsibility. 
Nah. Just kidding. He is the weasel king. Those old Clintonian phrases 
flow trippingly from the tongue: ``I do not recall ... I do not believe 
... I may have talked about what to do in a nonlegal context at some 
point in the past, but I have no specific memory of that conversation 
... I have no recollection ... I cannot be absolutely sure ... I cannot 
respond to this inquiry because of the vagueness of its terms (`indirect,' 
`potential,' `could be involved').'' Tactical brain death. The straightest 
question provokes a corkscrew response. ``Do you admit or deny that 
you are the chief law-enforcement officer of the United States of 
America?'' Response: ``The President is frequently referred to as 
the chief law-enforcement officer, although nothing in the Constitution 
specifically designates the President as such...'' Henry Hyde is looking 
for clarity in all the wrong places. White House officials are giggling 
that if the Republicans in Congress vote for impeachment, it will 
be political suicide _ poison Kool-Aid time. ``Paula Jonestown,'' 
as one Clinton aide sniggers. It is hard to get caught up in the debate 
over how the president should be punished. Why not a gantlet with 
Ping-Pong paddles? I think that life and posterity will punish Clinton 
more severely than Congress. Clio, the Muse of history, will remain 
immune to his seductions. Even the Rev. Starr has made himself happily 
available to the celebrity culture. When Diane Sawyer asked him whether 
it would be appropriate for him to be questioned about his own private 
life, I was desperately hoping he would not take the bait. Instead, 
the buttoned-down, pursed-lipped prosecutor volunteered that he had 
never been unfaithful to his wife. Woody Allen's new movie, ``Celebrity,'' 
begins with a scene that many construed to be a homage to Monica and 
Bill. Melanie Griffith, playing a movie star, offers to give a certain 
kind of sex to Kenneth Branagh, a journalist writing a profile on 
her. ``What I do from the neck up,'' she says, kneeling before him, 
is none of her husband's business. Ah, yes. The sex that isn't sex. 
It is utterly mystifying that respected actors _ and worse, respected 
actresses _ are still so flattered to appear in Woody Allen's nasty 
little indulgences of his own bile. A casting call from Allen is just 
an invitation to degradation. I was not sure he could top the ugly 
scene in ``Deconstructing Harry'' in which Julia Louis-Dreyfus wore 
little white socks and had sex with her brother-in-law while her blind 
grandmother was standing by. But I underestimated his talent. His 
new film is a veritable anthology of erotic tackiness. He has a hooker, 
played by Bebe Neuwirth, instruct Judy Davis in the proper technique 
of the sex that isn't sex, using a banana as a teaching tool. He has 
an Amazonian model, played by Charlize Theron, explain the pan-orgasmic 
nature of her exquisitely sensitive body, while Branagh, playing Allen, 
finds meaning in the universe in the sight of her tight little dress. 
(Ms. Theron showed this clip to Jay Leno, as she sat on the ``Tonight 
Show'' couch next to Jimmy Carter.) There was a time, a million years 
ago, when Woody Allen's movies had a heart. Now, they have only another 
organ. They still begin with black-and-white titles against an accompaniment 
of old jazz _ this is supposed to prove their authenticity and their 
art _ and then immediately go sour. This movie is itself a sex scandal, 
and as I watched it, I kept being reminded of the president. Like 
Clinton, the filmmaker is now most famous for a sex scandal with a 
young woman. Like Clinton, Allen feels supremely sorry for himself. 
Like Clinton, Allen just can't figure out how and why this happened 
to him. Like I said, it isn't a pretty place.
