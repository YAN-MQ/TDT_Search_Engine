fast-food restaurants are an important link in hollywood's marketing 
chain. they lure in young moviegoers by offering collectible items, 
as jennifer auther reports. it usually occurs in the summer, but this 
year, a fast-food promotion war has erupted, tied to the holiday season's 
blockbuster movies, "a bug's life" and "the rugrats' movie." hang 
on to your diapies! we're goin' in! forget the whopper. parents are 
being pulled into burger king for a prize. we picked it because we 
wanted a watch. we have double sales, you know, and a lot of kids 
playing around the store asking for the toys. meantime, mcdonald's 
is banking its holiday sales on walt disney's "a bug's life." it's 
a bug-eat-bug world out there, princess. one of those circle of life 
things. i think they're cool because they can walk and they're bugs. 
mcdonald's was first in fast food to offer toys with meals 20 years 
ago, and why mess with a good thing? after all, what drives all this? 
television. but she loves it here to begin with. but the toys are 
just an added extra bonus. mcdonald's concedes burgers and bugs normally 
don't mix, but -- the disney programs continue to be some of our best 
performers throughout the entire year. don't tell the kids, but studio 
and fast-food execs hatch this type of promotion years in advance. 
your typical marketing budget on a major movie these days is at least 
$20 million. but you can double that with a fast-food chain tie-in, 
so it gives you a tremendous opportunity to extend your reach. the 
only potential loser is the fast-food chain which would take a hit 
if a movie bombs at the box office. not likely with these two movies.
