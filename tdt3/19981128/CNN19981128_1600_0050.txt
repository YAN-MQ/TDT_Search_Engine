president clinton says he wants all americans to benefit from the 
country's thriving economy. in his weekly radio address, he announced 
new federal housing vouchers for low-income families, worth almost 
$130 million. the vouchers are intended to help an estimated 17,000 
families pay rent. earlier this month, the department of housing and 
urban development announced another $700 million in grants for low-income 
older americans and people with disabilities. president clinton says 
no one should have to worry about having a place to live. americans 
should never have to choose between putting a meal on the table or 
putting a roof on their heads. that's why i'm pleased that this month 
we're awarding nearly $700 million in housing and urban development 
grants to make sure no one has to make that impossible choice. to 
qualify for housing aid, hud says applicants must have an income of 
less than $8,000 a year.
