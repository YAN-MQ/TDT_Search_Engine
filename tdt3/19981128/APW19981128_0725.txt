Journalists charged Saturday that a Miami-registered Web page was 
financed by Peru's intelligence service and was being used to slander 
and intimidate opposition politicians and journalists. The Web site, 
produced by a group calling itself the Pro-Defense of the Truth Association, 
appeared a month ago and has scared opponents of President Alberto 
Fujimori, who has close ties to the intelligence service. Human rights 
groups have long accused Peru's powerful National Intelligence Service 
of trying to intimidate its opponents and silence journalists who 
report on human rights abuses or corruption. The page, which contains 
more than 100 pages of text, has a ``white list'' and a ``black list'' 
of prominent politicians and journalists in Peru, giving detailed 
biographies and personal attacks on opposition figures. Among the 
13 people on the ``black list'' are the publisher of Peru's main opposition 
newspaper, Gustavo Mohme, popular television journalist Cesar Hildebrandt 
and Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade, Fujimori's main political rival. ``No 
one but the intelligence service could have the precise biographical 
and personal details that appear'' on the Web page, said political 
analyst Fernando Rospigliosi, who appears on the ``black list.'' He 
charges that the page is an attempt to discredit and intimidate opponents 
of the government and intelligence service. Angel Paez, head of the 
investigative unit of the daily La Republica and another journalist 
on the ``black list,'' said the site ``gathers all the articles written 
against me in the pro-government newspapers'' and was part of a campaign 
``apparently by the intelligence services, against journalists who 
criticize Fujimori and against opposition politicians.'' The page 
accuses Mohme, whose newspaper has broken stories on death squad activity 
and torture within the intelligence service, of treason, slandering 
the military and having ties to leftist guerrillas. ``Before long 
he will face popular justice at the hands of Peruvians,'' the page 
said about Mohme. The Web page was registered on the Internet on Oct. 
29 in Miami by a woman with a Peruvian accent calling herself Blanca 
Rivera, Peru's largest newspaper El Comercio reported. The newspaper 
said its investigation showed that the telephone and address she gave 
on the registration form appear to be false. Although it does not 
identify its author, the page says its creators are: ``a group of 
professionals, university students and people like you'' who are alarmed 
by the existence of ``bad intentions, disinformation, distortion and 
the manipulation of the truth.'' The address of the Web page is: www.aprodev.org.
