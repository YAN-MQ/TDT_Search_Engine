Exxon and mobil have confirmed the oil companies are discussing a 
possible merger. Sources say if a deal is reached, it could be announced 
as early as tuesday. Analysts say Exxon, the biggest oil company in 
the United States is looking to cut costs and competition by acquiring 
number two mobil. We're in a global market, and because of this, bigger 
is better. And as a result of that, you can see right down the line 
in the financials, in the oil sector, in the telecommunications, companies 
gobbling up other companies and becoming bigger and better. The deal 
would be worth an estimated $67 billion, which would make it the most 
expensive merger ever.
