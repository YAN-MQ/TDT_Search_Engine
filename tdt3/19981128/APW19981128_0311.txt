The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday to a cease-fire 
to end the fighting between rebels and forces loyal to Congolese President 
Laurent-Desire Kabila, French President Jacques Chirac said. Chirac 
told a news conference on the final day of a summit of African leaders 
in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo ``had reached a consensus to 
stop this war.'' Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a 
cease-fire agreement was to be signed sometime in December before 
a meeting of the Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, 
Chirac said. ``The Secretary General has achieved an agreement for 
the reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and 
painful war,'' Chirac said. Earlier, Annan presided at a two-hour 
meeting of officials, including Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and 
Rwanda, who are supporting rebels waging an insurgency in Congo. The 
heads of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part. Chirac said the 
meeting had been ``held in a tense but not hostile environment.'' 
He said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms and the need to establish 
dialogue. ``Every party has made progress toward a greater rapprochement,'' 
he said. The purpose of the talks on the sidelines of an African summit 
that focused on security was to try to work out some framework for 
peace negotiations between the warring parties. Annan on Friday had 
urged African leaders _ especially those at war in Congo _ to renounce 
violence and accept compromise to achieve peace. Speaking to the summit 
Friday, Annan said many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture 
of intolerance'' and that the Congo conflict poses the continent's 
greatest challenge. Chirac on Friday urged African nations to do their 
own peacekeeping _ a departure from past practices that put the burden 
on France and other Western nations. Chirac also renewed France's 
call for a regional peace conference in central Africa's Great Lakes 
region. Annan and Chirac spoke at the opening ceremony of the 20th 
French-African summit, where 34 African leaders confronted the issue 
of how to tame wars raging across the continent. All eyes were on 
Kabila, who finally sat down with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni 
and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader. Kabila's presence in France 
has been the focus of attention following the decision by Britain's 
House of Lords rejecting immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto 
Pinochet. French Prosecutors, responding to complaints by human rights 
groups, ruled Friday that Kabila could not be pursued for human rights 
violations because he benefits from customary immunity accorded heads 
of state in office. At a state dinner Friday night, Kabila was the 
only African leader Chirac did not publicly greet on the steps of 
the Elysee Palace. Instead, Chirac welcomed the Congolese leader inside, 
far from the cameras. Summit participants said they hoped for progress 
in the Congo crisis. Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister 
in Africa, said he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo 
in December. Kabila in the past had not been optimistic, saying a 
pullout of Rwandan and Ugandan-backed forces from the Congo was a 
precondition for substantive peace talks. Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine 
Colonna, said Friday that there had been some progress toward a dialogue 
between Kabila and his adversaries, with each of the parties presenting 
their views. The French president stressed the need for Africans to 
take more responsibility for settling conflicts. ``Instability is 
not Africa's fate. It is of course a matter of responsibility for 
Africans themselves,'' Chirac said.
