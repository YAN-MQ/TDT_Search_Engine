Daria Timochenko took the gold medal in the ladies skating program 
Saturday at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships. Timochenko, 
18, was followed by 13-year-old American junior national's champion, 
Sarah Hughes of Kings Point, N.Y., and compatriot Viktoria Volchokova. 
The victory was Timochenko's best personal result following two second 
finishes on the junior Grand Prix circuit and a silver in the Russian 
national's. Although a bit shaky in her landings, Timochenko, a second-year 
student of physical education at Moscow University, impressed the 
panel of judges with a triple lutz, double toe-loop routine among 
other combinations, earning a score of 5.3 to 5.6 for technical merit 
and 5.3 to 5.7 for artistry. She led a Russian sweep of five medals 
of a possible 12 in the championships, including two golds. Russians 
have dominated ice skating in the last six years, with skaters like 
Ilia Kulik, Alexei Yagudin, Irina Slutskaja and Julia Soldatova. They 
have claimed 14 of a possible 24 gold medals since 1994. In the mens 
competition, Ilia Klimkin, 18, the latest rising Russian star overshadowed 
his rivals with a daring quadruple triple toe-loop, triple toe-combination 
among other stunts in his repertoire, to take the men's title. Jamie 
Silverstein, 14, and Justin Pekarek, 17, sparkled in the ice dance 
to win gold, while reigning champions, Yulia Obertas and Dmitry Palamarchuk 
of Ukraine, maintained their form to defend the title in the pairs.
