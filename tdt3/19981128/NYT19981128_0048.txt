Not for nothing did Oscar Wilde declare that ``biography lends to 
death a new terror,'' and the famous have long forum-shopped for sympathetic 
chroniclers of their lives. But the recent batch of electronic Boswells 
and celebrity subjects drawn together by l'affaire Lewinsky sometimes 
seems like a parody of Spy magazine's gallery of improbable doppelgangers, 
``Separated at Birth'' Chroniclers of the black experience as diverse 
as Chris Rock and Toni Morrison have described Bill Clinton as the 
nation's first black president, for his acquaintance with grief and 
his affinity for the downtrodden. So it was perhaps no accident that 
Clinton's first post-confession interview went to Tavis Smiley of 
the Black Entertainment Television cable channel. For her part, Paula 
Corbin Jones found herself in tears after her first post-lawsuit interview, 
with Deborah Norville of ``Inside Edition,'' produced a round of questions 
about her new nose and new hair. So the would-be poster child for 
working-class feminism turned next to Roseanne Barr, another rough-edged 
veteran of plastic surgery, for a sometimes tearful tale of her mistreatment 
at the hands of a man. Ms. Barr responded with her own anecdote about 
sexual harassment, telling how, when she applied for a job cleaning 
ovens at a pizzeria, she was asked to sit on a stool and smoke while 
a worker watched her. Kenneth Starr, shaping up as perhaps the nation's 
biggest political pariah since Richard M. Nixon, chose Diane Sawyer, 
herself a first-hand expert on the perils of impeachment as someone 
who helped Nixon with his memoirs in those dark post-resignation days 
at San Clemente. Under Ms. Sawyer's questioning, the independent counsel 
conceded that the current occupant of the Oval Office was ``extraordinarily 
talented, wonderfully empathetic.'' Linda Tripp, who last summer tremulously 
told the nation ``I'm just like you,'' is talking about talking to 
Larry King, the empathetic Everyman who runs his nightly broadcast 
on CNN like a kind of national bartender, listening to the stories 
of friends and strangers, happy and sad. And Monica Lewinsky, the 
star-struck former intern who started it all, spurned cash for class, 
choosing modern broadcasting's original million-dollar woman, Barbara 
Walters, who did not grow up in Beverly Hills but has herself dated 
a famous politician, Sen. John Warner, R-Va. ``No one is giving her 
credit for doing this interview out of desire to maintain her credibility 
and for turning down millions, millions,'' Ms. Walters said. Even 
Bill Gates, Earth's richest mortal, couldn't resist choosing a fellow 
entrepreneur recently for a rare interview in pastel shades. His mouthpiece? 
The nation's reigning life-style mogul, Martha Stewart.
