Mexican officials are warning people who live near the volcano called 
"El popo" to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. They don't expect 
a strong eruption, but the volcano spewed red-hot lava and gases twice 
on Friday. The 18,000-foot volcano is about 40 miles southeast of 
Mexico city. Civil defense officials say ash from the volcano fell 
on southern portions of the city.
