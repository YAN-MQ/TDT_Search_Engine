Moscow is finally coming clean about President Boris Yeltsin's health. 
For the first time, the Kremlin has acknowledged Yeltsin had several 
mild heart attacks while campaigning two years ago. At that time, 
his press secretary said he only had a sore throat. He later acknowledged 
Yeltsin had had one heart attack. The Kremlin says Yeltsin is now 
being treated for pneumonia and insists he's well enough to continue 
as president until the next election in 2000.
