Martin gurule may be the most wanted man in Texas. Eric horng reports 
on the search for the first inmate to escape from the state's death 
row since the days of Bonnie and Clyde. Hundreds of officers are combing 
the Woods around Huntsville, texas, taking to the air and navigating 
rugged terrain on foot, searching for a man with very little to lose. 
Authorities say 29-year-old Martin gurule escaped from the Ellis one 
prison unit early Friday. It appears they fashioned some clothing 
and pillows and sheets to give the appearance they were sleeping in 
their bunk. Officials say gurule and six other inmates then slipped 
out of a Recreation yard and climbed onto a roof. After waiting for 
more than three hours, the men made a dash for the perimeter of the 
prison. A guard spotted the inmates and opened fire. The six other 
prisoners surrendered, but gurule kept going, scaling two razor-wire 
fences. Now his freedom is robbing nearby residents of theirs. That's 
the most frightening part, that he could get my mom, my sister, my 
dad, anybody. Gurule was convicted and sentenced to death for killing 
two men during a 1992 restaurant robbery in corpus Christi. Prior 
to his escape, prison officials considered gurule a well-behaved inmate, 
even giving him access to air-conditioning. But now, with gurule on 
the loose, the prosecutor who put him away fears retribution. When 
you're prosecuting these people and sending them away to death row, 
you think there's no way they can escape from death row. That's probably 
the most secure area in the state of Texas. That's because before 
gurule, no inmate had escaped from the lone star state's death row 
since a member of Bonnie and Clyde's gang broke out in 1934. No date 
had been set for gurule's execution, but police say if they come upon 
this convicted killer and he does not surrender, the end could come 
here in the Woods of east Texas. Eric horng, "Headline News."
