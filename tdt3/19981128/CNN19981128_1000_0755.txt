Top stories are next. Then in "Dollars & Sense" -- why merge and surge 
were the key words on Wall Street this week. And later -- why the 
guys don't mess with this arm wrestling champion. The more you do 
something, the better you get. State farm's been settling car insurance 
claims for over 75 years. Millions of 'em. We've come up with a system 
that works so well... that more drivers trust state farm... than all 
those cut-rate insurance companies put together. You're buying into 
that promise that we're gonna be there... to take care of you when 
the claim happens. Every day state farm handles over 30,000 claims. 
It's a practice- makes-perfect thing. That's the reason the competition 
doesn't stand a chance. And like a good neighbor state farm is there 
wooo! I actually got in. You broke into personnel! Yeah, these are 
salaries of every person in the company. Look, this senior vp makes 
about half as much as this senior vp. Bet he doesn't know that. Sure 
he does. I just E-mailed everbody in the company.
