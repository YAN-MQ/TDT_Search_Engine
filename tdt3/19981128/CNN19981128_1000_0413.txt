The federal government is planning to perform crash tests on dozen's 
of 1999 model cars and trucks. The national highway traffic safety 
administration says the tests will cover 63 vehicles. 32 will be tested 
for front-impact crashes. 31 models will be tested for impact to the 
driver's side. The tests will give consumers front-impact safety information 
on 70% of the 1999 model vehicles sold in the United States. Side-impact 
results will be available on 80%. Vehicles will be rated on a scale 
of one to five stars. Test results will be posted on the Internet 
as they become available.
