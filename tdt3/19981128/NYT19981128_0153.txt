In an unusual linkup of a company management training facility with 
an existing complex that serves a variety of companies, the Pfizer 
Corp. has broken ground on a 110,000-square-foot education center 
on the grounds of the Doral Arrowwood hotel and conference center. 
At the groundbreaking, B.J. Robison, Pfizer's senior vice president 
for corporate employee resources, said that the training center, to 
be used by the company's sales managers, would be vital to the company's 
plan to move up from its present position as the fourth-largest pharmaceutical 
company to become the largest in the world. ``It will help us attract, 
train and retain the best people,'' Robison said. ``Our management-training 
programs will be conducted here as of January 2000, when the center 
opens, which is significant since Pfizer will become the world's No. 
1 pharmaceutical company by the year 2001.'' He added that the center 
itself would create 120 new full-time jobs. Establishing such a corporate 
presence at an existing conference center ``is a unique arrangement,'' 
said Steven Smith, spokesman for the International Association of 
Conference Centers, based in St. Louis. ``Most companies build their 
own discrete centers in isolated locations,'' he said in a telephone 
interview. ``But that can backfire because when they're not using 
it they can have a tough time attracting other users. Also corporations 
aren't in the hospitality business and usually aren't very good at 
it.'' Pfizer already had a long-term relationship with Arrowwood, 
according to Art Silverman, Pfizer's director of corporate services. 
He said it had conducted many of its training programs at the 318,000-square-foot 
center on Anderson Hill Road, where it maintains 25 to 30 full-time 
employees. ``We decided we needed to build our own center because 
we're expanding our sales force,'' Silverman said. This is due in 
part to Pfizer's introduction of several new drugs in recent years, 
including the much-discussed Viagra male-potency enhancer. ``There 
are several more in the pipeline,'' Silverman said, adding that the 
company believed that the new drugs would significantly increase business. 
Before deciding to build at Arrowwood, Pfizer had considered the feasibility 
of establishing its own separate center, according to Josh Kuriloff, 
a senior director at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, which was enlisted by 
Pfizer to find an appropriate site. ``We looked for about a year, 
mostly in New York and New Jersey,'' Kuriloff said. Arrowwood was 
ultimately chosen because it was ``known territory, close to Pfizer's 
headquarters in Manhattan,'' he explained. ``In addition,'' he noted, 
``it had an existing infrastructure the company could utilize, such 
as hotel rooms, recreational and dining facilities.'' Kuriloff said 
Pfizer would have an exclusive 15-year lease valued at around $170 
million. ``That includes everything,'' he said, ``use of the center, 
hotel, all the facilities.'' Among other things it calls for Pfizer's 
committing to 33,000 room nights a year. ``Working out the details 
was overwhelmingly complex,'' Kuriloff said. To persuade Pfizer to 
build its center at Arrowwood, state and county officials, working 
with the Village of Rye Brook, eventually came up with an incentive 
package worth around $27 million in grants, tax abatements and energy 
rebates, according to Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State 
Development Corp. ``They were being offered even better deals to move 
to New Jersey,'' Gargano said. ``But their good working relationship 
with Arrowwood proved a major selling point.'' The $40-million construction 
project, which received its final approvals on Nov. 17, is a boon 
for Rye Brook and one of the most complex economic deals in the village's 
history, said Village Manager Christopher Russo., During negotiations, 
he said, Arrowwood agreed to drop a $2.5 million judgment that it 
had won for overpayment of village taxes in exchange for economic 
incentives for the project. ``We dodged a bullet,'' Russo said. ``I 
don't know where we would have gotten the money.'' The center will 
occupy a sloping piece of property adjacent to the existing conference 
center and abutting Arrowwood's nine-hole golf course. To accommodate 
the increased business generated by the center, 100 new hotel rooms 
will be added to Arrowwood's current total of 274. ``From the outside, 
the center will connect to Arrowwood as if it were one building,'' 
said Ron Rheaume, project manager for the Hillier Group of Princeton, 
N.J., which designed Arrowwood in 1983. But inside, the Pfizer Learning 
Center ``will have its own separate entrance and identity,'' Rheaume 
said. Arrowwood is a low-slung, cedar-sided structure that sits on 
146 heavily wooded acres. The design for the center will attempt to 
take advantage of the surroundings, Rheaume said, and ``bring the 
outdoors in.'' ``There will be tree-like lighting elements throughout 
and a leaf pattern on the ceiling, as well as lots of glass looking 
out on the golf course,'' Rheaume added. The center will have a restaurant, 
meeting rooms and a studio for developing training tapes and making 
live training broadcasts. All the meeting rooms will have rear screen 
projectors and seats equipped with computer ports. ``From their seats, 
employees can connect to the network and, using key pads, vote on 
instant corporate surveys,'' Rheaume explained. Arrowwood itself has 
recently completed an $8 million refurbishment of its facilities, 
guest rooms and an expansion of its sports center, according to Bruce 
Blum, president of Doral Hotels and Resorts. ``The rooms have all 
been upgraded with new finishes, so they will look like new and match 
the new rooms being built for Pfizer.'' When the new rooms are not 
being used by Pfizer, they will be open to other guests, as well, 
Blum added. While the timing coincided, the upgrading of hotel facilities 
was not done exclusively for Pfizer, Blum said. ``While we're working 
with companies like Pfizer and others during the week, we also have 
to be a resort for the people who come here on the weekends and pay 
out of their own pockets,'' he said. (The weekend rate for Friday 
and Saturday, $135 per night, includes buffet breakfast.) ``To attract 
that business in our competitive marketplace, it requires doing total 
upgrades of facilities on a regular basis.''
