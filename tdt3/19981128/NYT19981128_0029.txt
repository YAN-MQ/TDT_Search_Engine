Let's all share a sardonic chuckle over this cosmic paradox: At the 
height of its global ascendancy, supposedly optimistic and youth-obsessed 
America is now also increasingly fixated on death. It's no mystery: 
As the population ages, intimations of mortality are focusing minds. 
This _ at the end of the millennium no less _ helps to explain not 
just the vogue for mysticism and attendant claptrap, but also why 
the folks at ``60 Minutes'' last week figured that showing a mercy 
killing by Dr. Jack Kevorkian after Sunday dinner would be good for 
ratings (followed by the soothing otherworldly series ``Touched by 
an Angel''). America's No. 1 heartthrob, Brad Pitt, has been cast 
as the Grim Reaper in ``Meet Joe Black.'' And Robin Williams, arguably 
the country's funniest person, plays a serious dead guy who rescues 
his dead wife from hell in the New Age tear-jerker ``What Dreams May 
Come.'' The films may be bombs, but they affirm that Hollywood, ever 
fond of bloody murder, is adjusting its mortal mix to try and cash 
in on the public mood. Alas, the fixation on mortality means a lot 
of trees have to die too. And not just because of best-sellers like 
``Tuesdays With Morrie'' (Doubleday, 1997) by Mitch Ablom, about a 
sportswriter's visits with his dying mentor; ``How We Die'' (Knopf, 
1993) by Sherwin B. Nuland, or the books of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, 
champion of the hospice movement. When a subject is hot _ actually, 
cold, in this case _ the publishing industry stands ready to serve 
it up for different audiences. Here is a sampling from dozens of recent 
books on death and bereavement. _ By TOM KUNTZ DEATH BOOK 1: ``Living 
With the End in Mind: A Practical Checklist for Living Life to the 
Fullest by Embracing Your Mortality'' (Three Rivers Press, 1998) by 
Erin Tierney Kramp and Douglas H. Kramp, with Emily P. McKhann. The 
gist, from the cover blurb: A life-affirming look at preparing yourself 
and your loved ones for the inevitable. . . . The inspiring couple 
who have co-authored this book have already garnered widespread media 
coverage, from ``20/20'' to ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' Sample Bit 
of Advice: Casually drive through the cemetery of your choice with 
your children or grandchildren so it is familiar. We took our daughter 
to the cemetery on a beautiful, spring day to talk about the burial 
process. A burial was taking place nearby, and we pointed out the 
different stages of funerals. We said, ``Look, someone already went 
to heaven, and now they are burying the body. . . .'' DEATH BOOK 2: 
``The True Work of Dying: A Practical and Compassionate Guide to Easing 
the Dying Process'' (Avon, 1997) by Jan Selliken Bernard and Miriam 
Schnieder. The gist, from the cover blurb: This groundbreaking, holistic 
guide presents rare insights and reassuring practical advice on how 
to navigate the final weeks before death. Interesting coinage: Home 
deathing. Quote: Just as a little bit of home has been brought to 
the birthing room, we believe medical institutions and families should 
make the same effort to bring ``home'' to the ``deathing room,'' wherever 
it may be. DEATH BOOK 3: ``Then an Angel Came: A Family's Inspiring 
True Story of Loss and Renewal'' (Kensington, 1997) by Carol Gino. 
The gist: An ``unforgettable true story'' (cover blurb) about a grieving 
family saved by an angel _ a very large angel _ after an infant's 
death. Confusing description of angel: ``I mean, she wasn't only big, 
she was magnificent. Skyscrapers are big, but mountains have something 
extra. Well, this angel was like the Himalayas, she was like the Grand 
Canyon, she was like . . .'' DEATH BOOK 4:``How Different Religions 
View Death and Afterlife'' (2d edition, The Charles Press, 1998), 
edited by Christopher Jay Johnson, Ph.D., and Marsha G. McGee, Ph.D. 
The gist, from the cover blurb: The teaching and death beliefs of 
the largest and fastest-growing religions in North America. Unsettling 
question answered: ``Is There a Hell and, if So, What Is It Like?'' 
Some of the book's answers, by religion: Roman Catholics: Hell designates 
a condition of self-chosen, permanent alienation from God, who bestows 
all blessings. Jews: The assumption is that God's caring nature rules 
out a sadistic punishment. The nature of hell is a mystery left alone 
by the Jew. Baptists: Most Southern Baptists believe in a place of 
punishment as it is described in the Bible, characterized by outer 
darkness, fire, torment and isolation. Buddhists: There are eight 
hot and cold hells, each associated with a particular type of suffering. 
These tortures are described in detail in order to develop compassion 
for the beings there as well as to create an incentive not to engage 
in the types of nonvirtuous behavior that will cause one to end up 
there. Muslims: Hell is described as a fire having seven levels. The 
lowest crackles and roars with fierce boiling water, scorching wind 
and wailing, wretched souls. DEATH BOOK 5: ``What Happens When You 
Die, From Your Last Breath to the First Spadeful'' (Citadel Press, 
1995) by Robert T. Hatch. The gist: Your handy guide to embalming 
and cremation, with alternatives ``including mummification _ and much 
more'' (cover blurb). Unsettling information: The book summarizes 
the major forms of bodily decay, including dessication: Dessication: 
The drying of certain parts, such as the cornea of the eye, is usually 
a sure indication of death. As the fluids sink to the back of the 
eye, the cornea dries out, glazes over and becomes wrinkled. This 
dryness may also be observed over abrasions or wounds. The lips also 
become hard and reddish black in color.
