Nicolas Huet captured a Snowboard World Cup parallel slalom Saturday 
for his first career win, while Olympic champion Karine Ruby defeated 
season standings leader Manuela Riegler in the women's event. France's 
Huet beat Elmar Messner, men's overall leader Matthieu Chiquet and 
Klaus Sammer in the final at this resort in Italy's western Alps. 
Former world champion Jeff Greenwood of the United States finished 
23rd. Ruby, the defending World Cup champion, denied Riegler a second 
straight slalom victory. Isabelle Blanc was third, with Sandra Farmand 
fourth. Austria's Riegler has 1,800 points in the World Cup standings, 
350 ahead of France's Ruby.
