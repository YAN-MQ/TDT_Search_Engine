The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday to a cease-fire, 
French President Jacques Chirac said. But with rebel groups apparently 
not consulted and vowing to battle on, the accord was shrouded in 
doubt. Chirac told a news conference on the final day of a summit 
of African leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo had reached 
a consensus to stop the war between rebels and forces loyal to Congolese 
President Laurent Kabila. But, perhaps ominously, rebel leaders in 
Congo were not present at Saturday's meeting having not been invited, 
raising doubts about how a cease-fire could be put into effect without 
their consent. At the frontline in Congo, rebel troops said Saturday 
the war would go on regardless. Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan, a cease-fire agreement was to be signed sometime before 
a meeting of the Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, 
Chirac said. ``The secretary general has achieved an agreement for 
the reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and 
painful war,'' Chirac said. Annan presided at a two-hour meeting of 
officials, including Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, 
who are supporting the insurgency. The heads of Zimbabwe and Burkina 
Faso also took part. Chirac said the meeting had been ``held in a 
tense but not hostile environment.'' He did not refer to whether the 
rebels in Congo had been consulted, or what their position now would 
be. He said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms and the need to 
establish dialogue. ``Every party has made progress toward a greater 
rapprochement,'' he said. Kabila came to power in May 1997 after toppling 
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and 
democracy in his renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics 
say his regime's 18 months in power has seen repressive policies and 
a growing intolerance of criticism. Disaffected members of his armed 
forces banded together with ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier this year 
and launched a rebellion, accusing the president of corruption, nepotism 
and tribalism. In an interview with France Info radio, Kabila said: 
``We will add our signature,'' to the agreement. ``But if they (the 
rebels) attack, if they advance, then we will have to continue to 
defend ourselves,'' he warned, adding that the cease-fire would only 
prosper if the rebels leave Congo. Earlier, at a noisy meeting with 
thousands of Congolese at a Paris hotel, Kabila said Uganda and Rwanda 
should be forced to withdraw their support of the rebel insurgency. 
``We want to pressure public opinion in France and everywhere so that 
this meeting will weigh heavily on the leaders of those countries,'' 
Kabila told the boisterous audience, some of whom banged drums and 
waved national flags. He said 30,000 Rwandan and Ugandan troops were 
currently in Congo. Kabila later met with Chirac at the Elysee Palace 
for 30 minutes. The purpose of the Paris talks on the sidelines of 
an African summit on security was to try to work out some framework 
for peace negotiations between the warring parties. Annan on Friday 
had urged African leaders _ especially those at war in Congo _ to 
renounce violence and accept compromise to achieve peace. Annan said 
many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture of intolerance'' 
and that the Congo conflict poses the continent's greatest challenge. 
Thirty four African leaders attended the 20th French-African summit. 
But throughout the summit, all eyes were on Kabila, who finally sat 
down with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, 
Rwanda's leader.
