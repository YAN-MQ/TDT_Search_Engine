the u.s. stock market broke a new record this week, but that wasn't 
the only thing to dominate the business headlines this week. stan 
case reports. from the internet to banks, to big oil, billion-dollar 
mergers dominated the business news this week. it began when america 
online announced it was buying netscape for $4.2 billion in stock. 
aol is the nation's biggest internet provider, and netscape provides 
the software many people use to browse the web. the deal includes 
sun microsystems, and will help that company promote its java programming 
language. germany's deutsche bank confirmed it's preparing to buy 
banker's trust for more than $9 billion in cash. it's the biggest 
take over of a u.s. financial company by an overseas bank. deutsche 
bank wants a foothold in the american stock and bond markets. exxon 
and mobile announced they're in merger talks, too. the proposed deal 
would be the biggest in history, create the biggest energy company 
in the world, and the biggest company of any kind in the united states. 
all this merger talk pushed wall street into record territory. the 
dow industrials were up nearly 2% for the week. and then there's the 
merger that wasn't. the yankees broke off talks with cablevision. 
cablevision already owns the new york knicks and rangers. but sources 
say discussions broke down over how much control yankee owner george 
steinbrenner would keep if the deal went through. that's "business 
this week," stan case, "cnn headline news."
