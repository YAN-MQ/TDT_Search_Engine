Many Americans may have already put a dent in their Christmas budgets. 
But retailers are hoping they'll keep on spending. Susan Lisovicz 
reports. They're making a list and checking it twice. We're shopping. 
We're ready to buy. I got a little more bonus at work, so I am going 
to spread it around. I feel exhilarated. And I am not going to stop 
my shopping because of what may have happened in the stock market. 
Despite economic troubles overseas and a volatile stock market at 
home, shopping malls all over the U.S. are expecting increased spending 
this holiday season. Their expectations are based on low unemployment, 
falling mortgage rates and cheap gas prices. Last year was one of 
the strongest retail holiday seasons ever. What the question now for 
the industry is, "can you put two seasons back to back with strong 
growth?" Right now, the answer isn't clear, but the early indications 
are that the industry may pull it off. Home furnishings, cosmetics, 
hand-held games and women's apparel are among the most popular gift 
choices this year. And more people are expected to pay for them in 
cash. There is a slight trend to use more cash right now. There've 
been very little growth in installment debt over the last year and 
a half. Despite the merry forecasts, retailers are keeping tight control 
of inventory levels to avoid the likelihood of markdowns. Managing 
that inventory has become a science because consumers continue to 
put off their shopping until the last minute. I think we're going 
to see a continuous shifting of peoples' pattern of waiting and waiting 
and waiting. But plenty of people are not waiting. Up to 250,000 shoppers 
are expected to pass through this mall today alone. Susan Lisovicz,
