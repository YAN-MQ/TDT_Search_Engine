a declining crime rate in california is proving to be bad for business 
at stores that sell firearms. jim moret examines the new attitude 
toward guns in the golden state. 1 in 159 californians bought a handgun 
last year according to the state department of justice. the popularity 
of the pistol is waning in california. law enforcement officials relate 
handgun sales to crime rates -- how one goes, so goes the other. i 
think that's been the pattern in various parts of the country. california 
-- i think we saw a significant spike during periods of civil unrest 
in years past. case in point -- los angeles, april 1992. after the 
riots we had in los angeles, there was a tremendous increase in people 
buying guns. sales ballooned following the riots. 81,000 more firearms 
were sold in 1993 than the year before, a total near 636,000. two-thirds 
were handguns. according to the california attorney general's office, 
crime is down in california, and handgun sales have hit their lowest 
level here since 1973. yes, firearms sales have gone down. and it 
is a factor that socially it has possibly not as acceptable as it 
used to be. a 1998 nationwide harris poll suggests that social stigma 
may be lessening the appeal of handgun ownership, noting -- but nra 
president charlton heston says social pressure should not influence 
gun ownership. the bill of rights doesn't promote the sale of guns, 
the bill of rights protects the american citizen to have the right 
to own and carry guns. that's what i'm concerned with. a definitive 
reason for california's decline in handgun sales may be as much a 
matter of opinion as it is a matter of politics. jim moret, cnn, los 
angeles.
