Holiday visitors to the national air and space museum in Washington 
can get a glimpse into the life of astronaut John Glenn. The museum 
is displaying exhibits about the career of the first American in orbit. 
The museum's director says Glenn holds a special place in American 
history. We're looking for heroes. And John Glenn certainly is a hero 
and is reincarnated again, in that sense. And any time we can have 
young people look up to somebody like a John Glenn or a Charles Lindbergh, 
I think it's great for this country, and it's also good for air and 
space. We're looking for heroes. And John Glenn certainly is a hero
