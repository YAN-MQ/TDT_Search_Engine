A woman in Switzerland says she's no pushover, especially when it 
comes to arm wrestling. Ron green from Swiss television reports. This 
is one young woman nobody is going to mess with. Her hobby is arm 
wrestling. Ready, go. And she's very good at it. Ready, go. Christine 
feller is a professional fitness instructor. She works out daily with 
boyfriend Thomas, who is also a top-notch arm wrestler. Ready, go. 
Training sessions are inevitably tough. But then it's time to call 
it a day, not forgetting a bit of friendly praise. Christine and Thomas 
have both won several national championships, as well as many other 
titles and trophies. Christine's enthusiasm for the sport goes back 
to her childhood. I used to arm wrestle in school just for fun, but 
always against boys, since I soon found out that the girls weren't 
strong enough. Food is an important factor. Apart from protein concentrates, 
Christine and Thomas follow a strict diet that avoids salt, fat and 
sweets. But what about things like anabolic steroids? oh, no. Never, 
never anabolic steroids. The arm wrestling season is peppered with 
events such as these regional championships. Christine has reached 
the semifinal round. And although she ultimately wins the bout, she's 
obviously not in top shape. But only Thomas knows is that she entered 
the tournament nursing a severely sore wrist. Before the final round, 
she resorts to a decidedly unscientific method of reducing the swelling. 
I just had to give it all I had and forget my wrist. But afterwards, 
the pain was worse than ever. And so today, there's no happy end for 
Christine. Ready, go. Although she puts up a good fight, she loses 
the final. a hug from the winner, no hard feelings, and second place 
is not the end of the world. This is Ron green of Swiss television 
and Swiss radio international for CNN world report.
