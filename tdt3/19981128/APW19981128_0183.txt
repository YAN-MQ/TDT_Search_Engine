South Africa on 268 led the West Indies by seven runs Saturday on 
the first innings at lunch on the third day of their first test match. 
A poor shot by Mark Boucher set South Africa back early on at Wanderers 
Stadium, and gave legspinner Rawl Lewis his first test wicket. He 
swept unnecessarily and top edged a catch to Brian Lara. When captain 
Hansie Cronje was bowled by Curtly Ambrose to give the West Indian 
his first wicket in this test, the writing was on the wall for South 
Africa. But veteran offspinner Pat Symcox had other ideas, and he 
shielded first Allan Donald for a while, and then test debutant David 
Terbrugge to push the South Africans past the West Indies first innings 
total. Symcox declined the opportunity of many singles, frustrating 
the West Indies efforts at having a bowl at Terbrugge, and when he 
was eventually run out for 20, a niggling 25-run last-wicket partnership 
was brought to an end and Terbrugge had scored just three runs off 
only 10 balls faced. Courtney Walsh was unable to advance his West 
Indies record test haul beyond 379, after the four wickets he took 
Friday, but Ambrose looked sharper than he had on the second day, 
and his two wickets gave his figures even more respectability. The 
West Indies had to survive just two overs before lunch.
