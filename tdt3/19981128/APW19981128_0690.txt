A Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer had her right leg amputated 
after she was wounded in a shootout with a sex-crimes suspect who 
later killed himself, police said Saturday. The wounded constable, 
Laurie White, 27, was among three officers dispatched to a townhouse 
in the northern coastal town of Kitimat on Friday to investigate a 
report of alleged sex offenses. After she was shot, she was airlifted 
to Vancouver General Hospital, where doctors tried unsuccessfully 
to save her leg. Other officers surrounded the townhouse, waiting 
for the gunman to surrender. Late Friday, officers heard a single 
shot. They entered the building two hours later and found the lone 
male occupant dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Sgt. Russ 
Grabb. The dead man was identified as Ronald Hoag, 44. Police declined 
to give details about the sex-crimes investigation that prompted the 
officers to be sent to his home.
