I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"CNN Headline News" forecast. Saturday morning, beautiful weather 
across most of the nation, with the exception of the southwest and 
the northern Rockies, where we'll see rain and snow due to a winter 
storm system. Working our way into Saturday evening and Sunday morning, 
a warm front develops across the Great Lakes, causing some low clouds 
and perhaps some drizzle. And a pacific storm system moves into the 
northwest, bringing rain and snow. The rest of the nation looking 
quite nice. The southwest will see some rain and snow in the higher 
elevations. Highs on Saturday, pretty warm in the south, generally 
in the 70s. 30s in New England, the northern plains and the northern 
Rockies. Your extended forecast showing milder temperatures throughout 
the extended forecast period. On Sunday, rain, snow and showers in 
the western third of the country. On Monday, rain in the northwest, 
a rain/snow mix in the Great Lakes. As you move to the south, we'll 
see thunderstorm activity over Texas. On Tuesday, showers and windy 
conditions in the northwest, a small area of rain/snow mix over lake 
Erie and a few showers along the gulf coast. Remember, you can get 
your four-day forecast for more than 7,200 cities at cNN.com.
