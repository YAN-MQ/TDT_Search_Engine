Friday college football, and the day no doubt belonged the longhorn's 
Ricky williams. The senior became the leading rusher in division I 
history as Texas topped the aggies 26-24. Tony dorsett had held the 
record for 22 years. My last game at home, the fans going crazy, run, 
Ricky run everywhere, it was a great feeling.
