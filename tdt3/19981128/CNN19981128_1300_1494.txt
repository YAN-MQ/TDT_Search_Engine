What's 300 feet tall and covered with more than 4,000 lights? It's 
the soldiers and sailors monument in downtown Indianapolis. During 
the holidays, it's transformed into a giant Christmas tree. Thousands 
gathered to watch it light up. This is the 36th year the monument 
has been adorned for the holiday season.
