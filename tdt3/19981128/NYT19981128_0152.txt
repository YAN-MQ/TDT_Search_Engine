Theodore Newhouse, who began a lifelong career in publishing as a 
manager of a family-owned newspaper, The Long Island Press, and helped 
his brothers assemble one of the nation's biggest communications conglomerates, 
died Saturday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in the Riverdale section 
of the Bronx after a long illness. He was 95. Newhouse was the last 
of the founding brothers who turned from hawking newspapers on the 
street to buying newspaper companies. The Newhouse holdings now include 
26 newspapers; Conde Nast Publications, which publishes The New Yorker, 
Vogue and Vanity Fair; the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade, and 
interests in cable television programming and cable systems. As the 
associate publisher of Newhouse newspapers, Newhouse had kept up an 
active involvement in the family business until his health began to 
fail about 12 years ago, said David Starr, the senior editor of Newhouse 
newspapers. Newhouse moved into the nursing home in 1989. ``He was 
a hands-on, shirtsleeves manager and he knew more about newspaper 
production than anybody,'' Starr said. ``He was the elder person in 
the family and in the business. He was the consultant on everything.'' 
Newhouse was raised in Bayonne, N.J., one of eight children of impoverished 
immigrants. His father came from Russia; his mother was from Austria. 
As a child, Newhouse helped the family by selling newspapers on the 
street. His eldest brother, Samuel I. Newhouse, who died in 1979, 
got the family into the publishing business when he bought The Staten 
Island Advance, a financially troubled paper, in 1922. Newhouse, then 
19, was recruited to help out and get what he would later call ``on 
the job training,'' as was another brother, Norman, who died in 1988. 
That fraternal management style came to characterize the Newhouse 
family business. Throughout his life, Newhouse maintained a strong 
interest in the arts. Even as he was working at the family's first 
newspapers, he took night courses at several New York City universities 
in opera, music and art, and studied dance in the summers. With his 
wife, Caroline H. Newhouse, whom he married in 1956 after the death 
of his first wife, Beatrice, Newhouse was a patron of several arts 
organizations, including the New York City Opera and Career Transition 
for Dancers, a nonprofit organization that helps professional dancers 
after they retire. In addition to his wife, Newhouse is survived by 
two granddaughters, Julie Lobel and Amy Bermant Adler, both of New 
York City, who are the children of his daughter, Jane Berman, and 
six great-grandchildren.
