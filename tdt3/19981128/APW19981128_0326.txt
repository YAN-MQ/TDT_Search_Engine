Violence between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanians on the border 
between Serbia's Kosovo province and Albania has flared anew, Serbian 
sources said Saturday. The Kosovo-based Media Center, close to Serbian 
authorities, said two incidents between Albanian arms smugglers and 
Yugoslav army border guards occurred Friday, further threatening a 
shaky October truce. According to the center, the border guards intercepted 
a group of smugglers, alleged to be supplying ethnic Albanian separatists 
in Kosovo with weapons, late Friday. The Albanians were forced to 
flee, leaving behind some 20 automatic rifles and a large quantity 
of ammunition. In another incident Friday, about 10 armed Albanian 
extremists tried to cross illegally into Kosovo, a southern province 
of Serbia, which together with Montenegro makes up the Yugoslav federation. 
The group opened fire on the border guards, who fired back, forcing 
the rebels to return to Albania. Nobody was injured in either incident, 
both of which occurred 70 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of the province's 
capital Pristina, the center said. The report could be independently 
confirmed. The center also said Serbian authorities, joined by international 
peace monitors, visited the border area the same day, where they found 
a number of ``shelters and bunkers,'' allegedly prepared for illegal 
crossings by Albanian extremists into Kosovo. Neighboring Albania 
has generally been supportive of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians 
in their struggle for independence, and most weapons for the rebels 
have come from across their border. There have been fears that fighting 
could renew in Kosovo if a solution is not reached by the time the 
snow melts. Clashes that began following a Serb crackdown on the separatists 
last February claimed hundreds of lives and forced more than 300,000 
people from their homes.
