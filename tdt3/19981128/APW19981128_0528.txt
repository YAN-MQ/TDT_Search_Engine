Turkey pressed stubbornly ahead Saturday with its campaign to get 
Italy to hand over a Kurdish rebel leader, dispatching a thick file 
full of graphic material on his alleged crimes to Rome. Italy has 
refused to extradite Abdullah Ocalan because he could face death penalty 
in Turkey. Despite this, Turkish Ambassador Inal Batu said a formal 
extradition request would be made to the Italian government in the 
next few days. He said the file on Ocalan includes around 900 pages 
of material describing in detail the rebel leader's alleged crimes, 
along with what he indicated were gruesome photographs and videos. 
``It's not something I'd advise minors under 18 to see,'' Batu told 
the Italian news agency ANSA. Germany also has arrest warrants for 
Ocalan on charges of murder and arson, but doesn't want him because 
it fears unrest among its immigrant population. About one-fifth of 
Germany's 2 million Turkish residents are Kurds. The Turks want him 
extradited to Turkey, while the Kurds are demanding his freedom. On 
Saturday, more than 15,000 Turks demonstrated peacefully in the German 
cities of Berlin, Bonn, Munich and Nuremberg, urging Italy to extradite 
Ocalan. A day earlier, around 11,000 Kurds demonstrated in Bonn when 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met with Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema. 
Schroeder made it clear Germany wouldn't ask for Ocalan's extradition. 
Germany and Italy now hope to extricate Europe from growing Kurdish-Turkish 
tension by arranging for an international court to try Ocalan. Turkey 
is vehemently opposed to the idea. ``This is a legal scandal,'' Turkish 
Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Saturday in Ankara, vowing 
that Turkey ``will never allow the issue to be taken to an international 
arena.'' Ocalan has asked Italy for political asylum in Italy and 
is now living in a heavily guarded villa on the outskirts of Rome. 
An Italian court ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give 
Germany more time to ponder extradition. What happens next depends 
on his asylum request and whether the idea of an international court 
goes anywhere. Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, and his 
Italian counterpart, Lamberto Dini, discussed the Ocalan case for 
several hours in Rome on Saturday along with teams of legal experts. 
In a statement, they said Italy and Germany were working together 
to see ``that Ocalan is brought to justice'' and to seek a negotiated 
end to the Kurdish conflict. Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or 
PKK, has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey 
since 1984 in a war that has killed 37,000 and devastated the region. 
The Turkish government has always refused to negotiate with the PKK. 
Ocalan was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12 when he arrived on a flight 
from Moscow. He has renounced armed struggle since his arrival, but 
the war continues. On Saturday, the rebels claimed they downed a Turkish 
troop transport helicopter. Turkish officials said 15 soldiers died 
when the helicopter crashed for unknown reasons.
