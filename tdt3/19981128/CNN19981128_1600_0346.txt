senator-elect jim bunning of kentucky says voters sent a message in 
this month's election -- reform social security. in the gop's radio 
address, bunning praised the republican-controlled congress for making 
reform of the retirement system possible by, among other things, balancing 
the federal budget. he chided democrats, and the president in particular, 
for making political hay out of the issue. president clinton in his 
last state of the union had pledged to save budget surpluses for social 
security, but he didn't do anything to follow up on that pledge. i 
introduced my bill to hold him to his promise, and unfortunately he 
and the democratic party chose to play politics with it. if nothing 
is done to fix social security, the government estimates it will begin 
running into debt in 20 years.
