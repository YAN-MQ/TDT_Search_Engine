President Clinton is back in Washington after spending Thanksgiving 
at camp david. Yesterday, the White House released the president's 
answers to 81 questions from the house Judiciary committee about the 
Monica Lewinsky matter. John king reports. The president sent his 
answers to Congress along with a request for a speedy resolution to 
the impeachment debate. In this 24-page response to the house Judiciary 
committee, the president -- The president was wrapping up a round 
of golf when his answers were delivered to Capitol Hill, where there 
is more and more talk of censure and reprimand instead of impeachment. 
The answers matter because whichever way Congress is going to go, 
there are still certain factual matters that will determine whether 
impeachment is the appropriate remedy or something less in the minds 
of many members. Chairman Henry Hyde wants to complete the inquiry 
in the next two weeks. And republicans were drafting three proposed 
articles of impeachment even before the president submitted his answers. 
Mr. Clinton's careful answers were drafted with more than the impeachment 
debate in mind. The independent counsel says his investigation is 
nowhere near over. You have to be concerned that Ken Starr is the 
type of person -- he is sufficiently single-minded and dedicated to 
his view of what his job is -- that he could very well decide to indict 
Bill Clinton when Bill Clinton is no longer president. Chairman Hyde 
says the committee will carefully review the president's answers. 
And this won't be the last word from the White House. Mr. Clinton's 
lawyers plan to submit a detailed legal brief in the days ahead, making 
their case against impeachment. John king, CNN, the White House.
