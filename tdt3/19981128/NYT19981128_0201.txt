Coach C. Vivian Stringer's return to the bench Saturday after after 
her son's arrest last week was supposed to be a respite from her family 
problems. The everyday rhythms of practice and the Scarlet Knights' 
drive to unseat Connecticut in the Big East and improve on last year's 
22-10 breakthrough season should have been a welcome distraction. 
But Stringer came back to a team having troubles of its own. The starting 
center, Jennifer Clemente, is hospitalized and out indefinitely with 
a blood clot in her lung. Another key front-line player, Usha Gilmore, 
sustained a concussion against Texas last week and has not practiced 
since. And point guard Tasha Pointer, the Big East's freshman of the 
year last season, is losing playing time because of a herniated disk 
in her back. A measure of relief came when the Scarlet Knights took 
the floor Saturday in the Coca-Cola Classic at the Louis Brown Athletic 
Center and wore down Buffalo, 70-47. The No. 11 Scarlet Knights (5-1) 
will play Arizona State, a 71-48 winner over Southwestern Louisiana 
earlier Saturday afternoon, in the championship on Sunday. But at 
the moment, the Scarlet Knights seem to be battling forces beyond 
basketball. Asked whether she felt snake-bit, Stringer said: ``You 
begin to wonder. What doesn't make me look in other directions for 
the cure or the antibody for this is that we're finding the cure within 
ourselves.'' The antidote Saturday afternoon before a boisterous crowd 
of 1,675 was the sophomore center Tammy Sutton-Brown, starting in 
place of Clemente. Sutton-Brown, a 6-foot-4-inch sophomore, scored 
13 points and hauled in 7 rebounds. `'I knew that my responsibility 
was to go in there and start,'' Sutton-Brown said, ``and start it 
off right.'' Guard Tomora Young also provided some remedy. Six weeks 
removed from knee surgery to mend a torn patellar tendon, she poured 
in a game-high 15 points. Rutgers surged ahead by 18-2, but Buffalo's 
pesky defense pulled the Bulls (4-1) to within 22-13 late in the first 
half, despite shooting 17 percent. Then Sutton-Brown began to muscle 
her way inside, scoring Rutgers' last 6 points in the first half to 
give the Scarlet Knights a 28-14 lead, then Rutgers' first 5 points 
of the second half to stretch the gap to 33-16. The Bulls went quietly 
after that, although Stringer was still wearing a scowl when the Scarlet 
Knights built the cushion to 20 and beyond. ``We were missing things, 
people who may have been open,'' Stringer said. ``We just need to 
communicate more, but it wasn't because we weren't making the effort.'' 
What Stringer saw next to the Rutgers bench could not have helped 
her mood. Pointer, who played 21 minutes and scored 5 points, spent 
most of the second half lying on the floor, having her lower back 
massaged by a trainer. Stringer missed the Scarlet Knights' 66-59 
victory over Texas last Tuesday to be with her son, David, a North 
Carolina State football player. He was charged with misdemeanor assault 
and being an accessory to the felony of larceny during an incident 
that left a 21-year-old man dead from a gunshot wound. She returned 
to practice on Wednesday. Stringer said she could immerse herself 
into coaching again because ``basketball is everything to me,'' she 
said. ``To that extent, I always delve into it and I continue to.'' 
As for her emotional state, Stringer said: ``I'd rather not comment. 
You see me here. I'm working hard. My team and I are going to be fine.'' 
The coach said an early-season tournament gives the team a chance 
to measure itself. It also gives Rutgers the unexpected necessity 
of trying untested players such as Davalyn Cunningham, a freshman 
guard who came through with 11 points on 4 of 6 shooting. For Arizona 
State (2-0), an upset over the Scarlet Knights would be a huge boost 
after a 10-17 record last season. ``It's obviously a great opportunity 
for us,'' Arizona State Coach Charli Turner Thorne said. ``It's kind 
of a nothing-to-lose situation.'' Saturday, Arizona State received 
16 points from Leaf Newman and 15 from Kitch Kitchen, and outrebounded 
Southwest Louisiana (0-4) by 46-35. REBOUNDS CHARLI TURNER THORNE, 
Arizona State's coach, is due to deliver her first child, a son, on 
Feb. 6, the same day the Sun Devils play host to Washington in a Pacific-10 
game. ``Hopefully he will not decide to come on that day,'' Turner 
Thorne said. ``If I have a long labor I still might get through the 
game.''
