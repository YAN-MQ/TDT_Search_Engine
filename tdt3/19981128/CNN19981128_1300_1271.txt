All right, on the field -- number 17 Georgia tech is in Athens facing 
in state rival and 12th-ranked Georgia. Virginia and Virginia tech 
are battling for the commonwealth cup. A victory today would give 
the cavaliers their best season since 1994. And Penn state is looking 
to improve its bowl standing while the spartans are hoping to make 
the postseason. Later today, the top-ranked volunteers will try to 
close out an undefeated season against 2-8 Vanderbilt. Tennessee has 
beaten the commodores 15 straight times. Also today, ninth-ranked 
notre dame will roll into Los Angeles to face rival souther California. 
Now the Irish are hoping to secure a major bowl bid, but today they 
will be without starting quarterback jarius Jackson who's out with 
a knee injury. The quarterback position obviously is only one position. 
You've got ten other players on offense that are in sync, in rhythm, 
confident with the scheme. Even though that motion is crucial and 
vital, you're not going to make ten other players uncomfortable by 
doing something ununfamiliar.
