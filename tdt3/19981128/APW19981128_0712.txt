The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday to a cease-fire, 
French President Jacques Chirac said. But with rebel groups in Congo 
vowing to battle on, the accord was shrouded in doubt. Chirac told 
a news conference on the final day of a summit of African leaders 
in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo had reached a consensus to 
stop the war between rebels and forces loyal to Congolese President 
Laurent Kabila. But, perhaps ominously, rebel troops at the frontline 
in Congo said they knew of no such plan, and vowed to battle on. Brokered 
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire agreement was to 
be signed sometime before a meeting of the Organization of African 
Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said. ``The secretary general has 
achieved an agreement for the reaffirmation of the commitment to put 
an end to this absurd and painful war,'' Chirac said. Annan presided 
at a two-hour meeting of officials, including Kabila and the leaders 
of Uganda and Rwanda, who are supporting the insurgency. The heads 
of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part. Chirac said the meeting 
had been ``held in a tense but not hostile environment.'' He did not 
refer to whether the rebels in Congo had been consulted, or what their 
position now would be. He said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms 
and the need to establish dialogue. ``Every party has made progress 
toward a greater rapprochement,'' he said. Kabila came to power in 
May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. 
He promised reform and democracy in his renamed Democratic Republic 
of Congo, but many critics say his regime's 18 months in power has 
seen repressive policies and a growing intolerance of criticism. Disaffected 
members of his armed forces banded together with ethnic Tutsi insurgents 
earlier this year and launched a rebellion, accusing the president 
of corruption, nepotism and tribalism. In an interview with France 
Info radio, Kabila said Saturday: ``We will add our signature,'' to 
the agreement. ``But if they (the rebels) attack, if they advance, 
then we will have to continue to defend ourselves,'' he warned, adding 
that the cease-fire would only prosper if the rebels leave Congo. 
The rebels were not invited to the Paris summit, and officials did 
not say what their stance was, or whether they had been consulted. 
Only one rebel leader, Arthur Ngoma, attended the summit as an observer, 
but could not be reached for comment. Standing over a bridge over 
the wide, chocolate-colored Congo River, a rebel commander, identified 
only by his first name Gabriel, refused to believe such a deal could 
be struck. ``Rwandans and Ugandans can agree upon whatever they want, 
but I am a Congolese and I have a war to fight,'' he said. ``We have 
started this war to kick Kabila out. We shall finish it.'' 14th graf
