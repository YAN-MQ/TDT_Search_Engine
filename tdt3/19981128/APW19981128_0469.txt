Russia and Norway have agreed to work toward restricting overfishing 
in the Barents Sea, a news agency reported Saturday. A joint commission 
of the two countries has agreed on a quota of 540,000 tons of cod 
to be taken from the arctic sea in 1999, the head of Russia's State 
Fishing Committee, Vladimir Izmailov, told the Interfax news agency. 
He said a meeting would be held with Icelandic officials next week 
regarding Iceland's role. Izmailov charged that Icelandic fishing 
crews have ignored fishing regulations in the open waters of the Barents 
Sea in recent years. He said Russia and Norway are prepared to allow 
quotas to Iceland for catching cod in their economic zones.
