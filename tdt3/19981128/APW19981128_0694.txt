Austrian Thomas Stangassinger, the first-run leader, withstood a blistering 
second run by Frenchman Sebastien Amiez to win a men's World Cup slalom 
Saturday on Aspen Mountain. Amiez stood a distant 22nd after the first 
run, 1.47 seconds behind Stangassinger, but the Frenchman skied to 
a 42.54-second final heat and took the provisional lead. The next 
20 skiers failed to better Amiez's two-run aggregate of 1 minute, 
27.58 seconds. Stangassinger then put together a solid second run 
of 43.75 that was only the 13th-fastest, but good enough to beat Amiez 
with a cumulative 1:27.32. Norway's Tom Stiansen was third in 1:27.69, 
followed by teammate Kjetil Andre Aamodt in 1:27.70. Italian Angelo 
Weiss, who started 38th but placed ninth after the initial run, finished 
fifth in 1:27.82. Austrian Christian Mayer was sixth in 1:27.94. Norwegian 
veteran Finn Christian Jagge, 28th after the first run, finished seventh 
at 1:28.05, thanks to the fastest second run of 42.46. Two late-seeded 
skiers, Drago Grubelnik of Slovenia and Giorgio Rocca of Italy, placed 
eighth and ninth, respectively, in 1:28.12 and 1:28.15. Pierrick Bourgeat 
of France, who won a season-opening slalom last Sunday in Park City, 
Utah, placed 10th in 1:28.16. Austria's Mario Reiter, runner-up to 
Stangassinger and just .23 seconds off the pace after the first run, 
was having a quick second run before he straddled the gate three from 
the finish. Norway's Lasse Kjus and Canada's Thomas Grandi, who stood 
sixth and eighth, respectively, after the first run, also missed gates 
on their second runs. Stangassinger, who finished second to Austrian 
Thomas Sykora in last season's World Cup slalom standings, made no 
noticeable errors on either of his runs down the icy courses that 
maintained their firmness despite warm temperatures. ``The second 
run was very tough for me,'' Stangassinger said. ``The snow was a 
little bit softer. The organization did a good job on course preparation 
all weekend. ``We have an early plane out of Denver, but I think we'll 
have time to celebrate tonight.'' Mayer's sixth-place finish was worth 
40 points and gave him 290, enabling him to reclaim the World Cup 
overall lead from teammate Stefan Eberharter by 10 points. Eberharter 
does not compete in slalom. In the first run, Norway's Hans-Petter 
Buraas and Austria's Siegfried Voglreiter both were faster than Stangassinger 
at the first intermediate clocking but carried too much speed into 
some tight gates farther down the course and failed to finish. Sykora 
underwent surgery on Monday to repair an injury to his patellar tendon 
and is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks.
