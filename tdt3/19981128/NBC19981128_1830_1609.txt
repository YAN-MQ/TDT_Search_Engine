Finally tonight, a relationships counselor who helps grandparents 
mend their broken hearts. Here's Dan Lothian. Is physical intimacy 
a normal activity for an 80 year old man? Meet Dr. Helen. Physical 
intimacy is normal at any age. Helen greenblat, a 78-year-old relationships 
counselor, a sort of ann Landers for her neighbors at this retirement 
community in Laguna hills, california. I don't read books so much, 
I read people. And then dishes out intimate advice to a generation 
that's experienced just about everything. You did for the first 80 
years of your life, don't blow it now. Her column is published twice 
a month in a community paper -- "The leisure world voice." Relationship 
problems once thought to be teen talk, now come from seniors. She 
started to tell me how lonely she was since her husband died and how 
the men were coming on to her, and she doesn't know what to do. And 
what Dr. Helen has found is that even the wise lose their way. I find 
that older people sometimes behave like teenagers. And sometimes, 
like young couples. People will have problems handling money, one 
wants to spend more and the other wants to save more. Helen's career 
as a columnist began five years ago, when she wrote a question-and-answer 
newsletter for a hospital. When the hospital went out of business, 
Helen continued writing, this time for the 19,000 people in her retirement 
community. For seniors struggling through what they had hoped would 
be care-free years, her advice fills a void. I enjoy it very much 
because I identify with it, the problems that the people in leisure 
world are having. I think her judgment is good. The questions are 
solid and the answers are good. She's got a good sense of humor. Especially 
love it when I agree with what she writes. At a time when people are 
living longer and better and becoming more active, Dr. Helen's column 
reminds them that age is largely a state of mind. Dan Lothian, NBC 
news, Los Angeles.
