When "NBC nightly news" continues in a moment -- prescriptions from 
Dr. helen advice about romance on the senior scene. The other day 
I'm driving down Broadway when that pastrami on rye catches up with 
me. Heartburn big time. My passenger says "here, take a Zantac 75." 
I say, "what are you, a doctor?" And he says, "yeah." The medicine 
in Zantac 75 is the #1 doctor-prescribed acid reducer. It relieves 
even your toughest heartburn controlling acid for up to 12 hours. 
A real gentleman, that doctor. Zantac 75 for tough heartburn. Keep 
it going. O.K., that's enough. Bayer can relieve joint inflammation 
and stiffness. Tylenol can't. and taken regularly, Bayer can help 
save your life. Ask your doctor.
