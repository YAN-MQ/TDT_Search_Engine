The cruise ship made famous by the long-running television show ``The 
Love Boat'' was stranded in port Saturday after two crew members were 
accused of carrying 25 kilograms (56 pounds) of heroin. The two Filipino 
cabin attendants have been charged in the case and two other unidentified 
men were detained for questioning, police said. The Pacific Princess 
was used as the setting for the popular 1977-86 American show ``The 
Love Boat'' _ where lonely passengers found romance. The drugs were 
discovered Thursday after the cruise ship Pacific Princess arrived 
at this port near Athens from Istanbul, Turkey, as part of a two-week 
cruise in the Mediterranean. Carrying some 600 passengers, mostly 
Americans, the ship had been due to sail on to the Greek island of 
Rhodes. It was awaiting permission to leave Piraeus from a public 
prosecutor handling the case. Gwyn Hughes, spokesman for the London-based 
P&AMP;O Cruises, which owns the Pacific Princess, said a few passengers 
had returned home on their own. But most were ``enjoying their stay 
in Athens,'' he said. ``We are awaiting the court process which we 
expect to be sorted out by Monday morning at the latest,'' Hughes 
said by telephone from London.
