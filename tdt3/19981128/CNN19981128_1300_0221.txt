Police continue searching for clues to a bizarre bus accident in Seattle. 
The bus tumbled 50 feet off the Aurora bridge yesterday when the driver 
lost control after being shot. The bus plowed through a guard rail 
and smashed onto an apartment building. The driver died when he was 
thrown from the vehicle. One passenger died of a gunshot wound to 
the head. Some reports indicate that person was the gunman, but police 
aren't confirming that. 34 others on the bus were injured, some seriously. 
Witnesses say they heard a boom, then ran for their lives. It was 
kind of slow motion, loud noise, things flying, didn't hear anything. 
Then when it hit, I heard a loud thump, then it was silent. Witnesses 
say it was a miracle more people weren't hurt. Authorities say they're 
treating the shooting of the bus driver as a Homicide.
