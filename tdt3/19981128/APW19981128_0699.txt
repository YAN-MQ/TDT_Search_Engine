Two policemen suffered minor injuries during a scuffle Saturday involving 
supporters of a mayor accused of trying to extort dlrs 2.5 million 
from companies hired to clean up after Hurricane Georges. Meanwhile, 
two officials _ including one from his own party _ said Toa Alta Mayor 
Angel Rodriguez should resign immediately because of the charges against 
him. The policemen were injured in an incident at the Luis Munoz Marin 
International Airport where supporters of Rodriguez had gathered to 
greet him as he returned from spending Thanksgiving with family in 
Philadelphia. Police said a scuffle broke out after taxi drivers made 
negative comments about Rodriguez and an argument ensued. The two 
officers were treated and released and further information on their 
injuries was not immediately available. Police held two people for 
questioning but did not file charges. Meanwhile, Comptroller Manuel 
Diaz Saldana, citing previous critical audits of Toa Alta's municipal 
finances by his office and by his predecessor, said Rodriguez should 
resign. Diaz Saldana, like Rodriguez, is a member of the pro-statehood 
New Progressive Party. On Saturday, the president of the rival Popular 
Democratic Party, Anibal Acevedo Vila, also called on Rodriguez to 
resign.
