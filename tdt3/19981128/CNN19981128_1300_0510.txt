This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather update." 
Snow is expected in Montana and Idaho early today, as a pacific storm 
system heads through the southwestern United States. Rain showers 
will spread from California into the four corners region with some 
snow across Utah and Colorado. A low-pressure storm tracking along 
a stationary front in the north will mean snow showers for the dakotas 
and the Great Lakes. A new pacific storm system will add to already 
heavy rain totals out west. High temperatures will be in the 30s and 
40s for the western United States, the 50s as far south as Los Angeles. 
You'll see 60s, 70s and 80s in the east with record-setting warm temperatures 
across most of the eastern and southern United States. The extended 
forecast includes heavy rain Monday in the northwest, with a Mix of 
rain and thunderstorms across the Mississippi valley into the Great 
Lakes. Scattered showers will be all that remains on Tuesday in the 
east, with a Mix of snow and rain in the western United States. Cooler 
temperatures are due in Wednesday. Look for readings to fall into 
the 30s across the northern Rockies. The extended forecast for more 
than 7,000 cities is at CNN.com.
