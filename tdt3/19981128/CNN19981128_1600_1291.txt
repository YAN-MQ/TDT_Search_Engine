former ole miss coach tommy tuberville said he's spent his entire 
career dreaming about coaching in a program like auburn's. in a dream 
come true, an emotional tuberville, family on hand, was introduced 
today as the man who'll try to lead the tigers back, from a dismal 
3-8 season. it's been real tough. it's been real tough for the auburn 
family and all the people surrounding, the administration, the school. 
but we've got to go forward, from this moment right now, we've going 
to go forward. tuberville takes over the full-time duties from terry 
bowden, who resigned midseason. now, terry's brother, tommy, is being 
courted by clemson and the university of south carolina football programs, 
both looking for head coaches. and bowden is hot. he led the tulane 
green wave to an undefeated 11-0 record and a conference usa crown.
