New Zealand has urged the Philippines not to carry out its first execution 
in 22 years, joining the Vatican, the European Union and Canada in 
their appeals. Amid growing fears about rising crime, legislators 
in 1994 brought back the death penalty, which had been abolished in 
1987. But no execution has been carried out. Leo Echegaray, a poor 
carpenter convicted of raping his step-daughter, is the first among 
more than 800 death-row inmates scheduled for execution. Foreign Undersecretary 
Leonides Caday said Saturday that New Zealand Ambassador Graeme Charles 
Waters called on him last week to express his concern. Waters reminded 
him that the Philippines had signed an international protocol that 
requires signatories to work for a world-wide end to the imposition 
of death penalties, he said. Caday said he told Waters the Philippines 
signed the protocol two years ago but did not ratify it. Franklin 
Ebdalin, foreign affairs assistant secretary for legal affairs, said 
the Philippines only made a commitment but ``didn't guarantee we'd 
abolish the death penalty.'' President Joseph Estrada, who has earlier 
turned down the appeals from the Vatican and other countries to cancel 
the execution, said the execution would serve as a lesson to child 
rapists. Many Filipinos believe the death penalty will deter crime 
and that crime remains rampant because no one has been executed. Roman 
Catholic bishops and human rights say there is no proof that the death 
penalty deters crime. More than 450 _ or more than half of those on 
death row _ have been convicted of rape, including 159 who abused 
their own children or other relatives. Between 1924 and 1976, the 
Philippines executed 84 people. Pablito Andan, who was convicted of 
rape and murder, is also scheduled to be executed this year but is 
appealing his sentence. At least five others whose sentences have 
been upheld by the Supreme Court may be executed next year. The 1987 
constitution abolished the death penalty but gave Congress the option 
of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as murder, kidnapping, 
rape and drug-trafficking.
