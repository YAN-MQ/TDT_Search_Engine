there's much more to the internet than most people can possibly imagine. 
for instance, here's something nasa is offering. more than 30 years 
ago, project "mercury" put an american in space. now, nasa has a web 
site dedicated to the "mercury 7" astronauts at the address below. 
you'll find an archive explaining the events leading up to america's 
first space flight and highlights of each mission. "freedom 7" carried 
"mercury" astronaut alan shepard into space in 1961. the site has 
photographs documenting the mission and a detailed description of 
each picture. "mercury" astronaut gus grissom followed shepard into 
space aboard the "liberty bell 7." the online photo documentary shows 
the unsuccessful attempt to retrieve the waterlogged capsule of america's 
second man in space. "mercury" astronaut john glenn rocketed into 
space next. the site has audio recorded by "friendship 7's" onboard 
flight recorder as glenn orbited the earth. three other "mercury" 
missions followed. nasa tells the story of each through words and 
pictures.
