Here we go again. Over the next few weeks, five balloon teams will 
begin a journey that has so far proven impossible to complete -- they'll 
try to fly nonstop, around the world. Among those getting ready for 
the marathon float is millionaire adventurer steve Fossett. His last 
attempt ended in August when he landed in the coral sea, after a Storm 
ruptured his balloon. Fossett is teaming up with rival Richard Branson 
this time. They'll take off from the Swiss Alps.
