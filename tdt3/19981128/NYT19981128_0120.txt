By October 1936, Victor Klemperer, a Jew, had been removed from his 
professorship at the Technical University in Dresden, Germany. He 
and his ``Aryan'' wife, Eva, lived in a small house of their own in 
a rural suburb of Dresden. They were ``virtually destitute,'' Klemperer 
notes in ``I Will Bear Witness,'' his diary of the years from 1933 
to 1941. (A second volume, to 1945, will be published next year. Klemperer 
died in Dresden in 1960.) In hopes of finding an appointment abroad, 
Klemperer had begun writing letters to friends and scholars all around 
the world, but it was already too late, as he well knew, and he considered 
himself bound to Germany. The house and its garden were the chief 
adornments of Eva's life, and, as Klemperer later said of his marriage, 
``I have always seemed glorious to myself on this one point of love 
and faithfulness.'' Eva, who shared all of her husband's privations, 
might have said the same. No single metaphor can convey the oppressive 
reality of living in a world that becomes, without limits, steadily 
more menacing and constricted. Every day Klemperer weighed his wife's 
infirmities, which were many. Every day he retallied the dwindling 
supply of marks and pfennigs and reassessed the restrictions the Nazis 
had imposed _ the loss of library privileges and the right to buy 
tobacco and to drive a car and to live in one's own home and, eventually, 
to move about the streets without wearing a yellow star. Yet every 
day, with few exceptions, Klemperer wrote in his diary and worked 
on a scholarly study of 18th-century literature. It was a labor not 
of desperate distraction but of love. Something about Klemperer makes 
him the most extraordinary German witness of Nazism that has yet come 
to light. Reviewers have mentioned his literary skill and his determination 
to chronicle the details that the historical record would miss _ details 
that he, a Jew cast away in a sea of anti-Semitism, read as auguries 
of his fate. These are great qualities indeed, but what illuminates 
them is his faith in reason. In October 1936, Klemperer notes both 
Hitler's attack on ``intellectualism'' and the widespread credulity 
among German people that grounded Hitler's attack. In words that still 
apply today, Klemperer writes: ``People treat reason as if it were 
the most minor and harmful aspect of a whole human being. It is as 
if a soldier standing guard were to say to himself: What good would 
my rifle be, if I were now to be attacked by a dozen enemies? I shall 
therefore lay it aside and smoke opium cigarettes until I doze off.'' 
For Klemperer, reason had nothing to do with class or profession or 
even intelligence. All around him he saw professors and intellectuals 
who abandoned reason for self-interest, who sided or temporized with 
the Nazis. He saw so many, in fact, that if he were to determine the 
fate of the Germans he might let ordinary people and even some leaders 
go. ``But I would have all the intellectuals strung up, and the professors 
three feet higher than the rest; they would be left hanging from the 
lampposts for as long as was compatible with hygiene.'' Klemperer 
was an heir of the Enlightenment, of Voltaire and Montesquieu, and 
he demonstrates that reason is not only a quality of mind _ in his 
case a deeply moral perception _ but also a cultural tradition of 
enormous value, one that has come under question in our own time. 
His example suggests that there can be no post-Enlightenment, only 
a sub-Enlightenment. There is nothing cold or distanced about the 
cast of Klemperer's character. Reason is a refuge in him from the 
emotions that flayed him and every Jew, as well as every reasonable 
German, while Hitler consolidated his power. But it allowed Klemperer 
to penetrate the historical moment with unrivaled acuity. In January 
1939, in a nation mad over race, Klemperer writes, ``Race, in the 
sense of pure blood, is a zoological concept, and a concept that long 
ago ceased to correspond to any reality, is at any rate less a reality 
than the old strict distinction between the spheres of man and wife.'' 
Then he adds: ``The solution of the Jewish question can only be found 
in the deliverance from those who have invented it. And the world 
_ because now this really does concern the world _ will be forced 
to act accordingly.''
