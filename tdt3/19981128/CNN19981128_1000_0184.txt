Day two of the holiday shopping binge is under way. With it, some 
insight from a leading accounting firm on the question of quality 
versus quantity. Deloitte and touche compared the holiday buying habits 
of Americans to shoppers in three European countries. It found on 
average, Americans plan to buy more gifts than Europeans, but will 
spend less on each item. The survey found Americans plan to buy 25 
gifts each this holiday season, the French eight, Britons seven and 
Germans five. But in the quality part of the equation, Americans come 
in last. While British shoppers will spend about $67 a gift, Germans 
$63 and the french $48. American gifts will cost only about $32 each.
