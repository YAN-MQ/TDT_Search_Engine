Andy Powell, who crawled across the finish line last year after collapsing 
with exhaustion, raced to victory Saturday in the Foot Locker Northeast 
Regional High School Cross Country Championship at Van Cortland Park 
in the Bronx. Powell, an undefeated 18-year-old senior at Oliver Ames 
High School in North Easton, Mass., ran the hilly, 5,000-meter course 
in 15 minutes 23.2 seconds to triumph by 125 yards over his Massachusetts 
rival, Franklyn Sanchez of Lynn Tech. In 1997, Powell, rated the top 
high school miler in the country, fell within a few strides of the 
finish but hung on for the eighth and final berth in the national 
meet. ``I still have the scars on my leg,'' said the Stanford-bound 
Powell, referring to his scrape last year. ``I dedicated this season 
to coming back and doing better.'' The top eight boys and top eight 
girls from the Northeast and three other regional meets qualify for 
the 20th Foot Locker Championships on Dec. 12 in Orlando, Fla. Amid 
spring-like 60-degree temperatures and a strong sun, senior Erin Sullivan 
of Mount Mansfield, Vt., the defending girls Northeast and national 
titlist, led the field through the first mile. But Sullivan weakened 
as the runners came out of the woods and onto the home straightaway, 
where Jillian Mastroianni surged ahead and went on to win in 17:54.2. 
Mastroianni, the 1997 New York State champion from Sayville High on 
Long Island, did not compete in last week's New York State meet, at 
the same site, to focus solely on the regional. ``I didn't want to 
taper off my training twice in two weeks,'' said Mastroianni, a junior 
who placed 15th in last year's nationals. New Jersey's Erin Donahue, 
a sophomore at Haddonfield High, and Cate Guiney, a senior at Middletown 
South, finished second and third, respectively. In all, New Jersey 
took five of the 16 qualifying berths, the most of any state. Cheryl 
Bauer of Morris Hills High was the eighth and last girls qualifier. 
The two New Jersey boys who earned nationals berth were state champion 
Nate Miller of Highland High and Jon Fasulo of Hunterdon Central. 
Donahue ran her best race of the season despite a strenuous schedule 
on Friday. A 5-foot-7-inch point guard on her high school basketball 
team, she attended a three-hour basketball practice on Friday morning, 
then, for fun, ran a 5-kilometer road race in the afternoon. ``But,'' 
she said, ``on Friday night, I rested.'' So did Powell, careful to 
conserve energy and remain on his feet for the entire race. He and 
Sanchez, competing shoulder to shoulder all season in New England, 
have become good friends. ``We decided beforehand to run with each 
other, not against each other,'' Powell said. ``That way, we felt 
one of us would win.''
