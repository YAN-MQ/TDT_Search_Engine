Ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim on Saturday accused two 
prosecutors of trying to cajole a potential witness into fabricating 
evidence of sex crimes by him. In a document filed Saturday in High 
Court, Anwar asked the court to remove senior government lawyers Abdul 
Gani Patail and Azahar Mohamed from his corruption and sexual misconduct 
trial. ``I believe that their continuing to be prosecutors in my trial 
will pervert the administration, and will result in a travesty of 
justice,'' Anwar said in a five-page affidavit handed out to reporters 
by his wife, Azizah Ismail. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks 
after he was fired as deputy prime minister and finance minister. 
His current trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be 
tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual 
misconduct, at a later date. He denies the charges, calling them part 
of political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor, Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad. In the affidavit, Anwar said that the two prosecutors 
tried to convict him by negotiating a plea bargain with his former 
tennis partner, Nallakaruppan Solaimalai. Anwar said Abdul Gani and 
Azahar indicated that they would indict Nallakaruppan under a lesser 
charge if he was prepared to lie about how Anwar committed sexual 
offenses with ``various married and unmarried women.'' Anwar said 
the two people went of ``out of their way to get Nallakaruppan to 
fabricate evidence in order to prefer more charges against me for 
other alleged sexual offenses.'' Abdul Gani and Azahar could not be 
reached for comment. Last month, Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah 
said that once Anwar's trial ends, more sex-related charges would 
be leveled against him based on new evidence against Anwar and Nallakaruppan. 
A businessman, Nalla was indicted shortly before Anwar's arrest and 
charged with unlawful possession of 125 rounds of live ammunition. 
He faces a mandatory death sentence if convicted. The bullets were 
said to have been found in Nalla's house during a police investigation 
of allegations published in the book ``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim 
Cannot Become Prime Minister.'' In the book, it is alleged that Nalla 
set up sexual trysts for Anwar while Anwar was still in power. Nalla 
and Anwar have denied the allegations, and Anwar has accused authorities 
of conspiring to destroy his political career. One of Nalla's lawyers, 
Manjeet Singh Dhillon, said earlier this week he planned to drop out 
of the case to take the stand as a defense witness. Meanwhile, a higher 
court on Saturday put off a request to free him on bail after Anwar's 
lawyers said they needed more time to study a new court ruling that 
could potentially disqualify any further attempts to free Anwar on 
bail. The higher court moved the hearing to Dec. 5.
