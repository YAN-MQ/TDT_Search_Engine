A fundamentalist Muslim lawmaker has vowed to stop a shopping festival 
planned in February, saying a stagnant economy cannot be improved 
by singers and moral corruption, a newspaper reported Saturday. Organizers 
from private and public sectors have said the shop-till-you-drop extravaganza 
would feature music concerts and dance troupes, a rarity in this conservative 
Muslim country. ``National economy cannot be activated by a singer 
from here, and a singer from there,'' Parliament member Muabarak al-Duwailah 
said in comments published by Al-Watan daily. Several religious organizations 
have criticized the planned event as a cause for corruption. Music 
concerts in Kuwait need to be approved by authorities, and when they 
are, audiences are forbidden from dancing. The festival, the first 
of its kind in Kuwait, is aimed at giving a shot in the arm of an 
economy ailing from low oil prices. Al-Duwailah said fundamentalists 
will continue to pressure the government to intervene and cancel the 
festival, al-Watan reported. If government ministers do not cooperate, 
Islamists will have to take other steps, al-Duwailah said. He did 
not elaborate. Fundamentalists form the second largest bloc in the 
non-partisan 50-member Parliament after government supporters.
