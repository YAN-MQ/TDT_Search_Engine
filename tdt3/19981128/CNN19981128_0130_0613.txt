The federal government has been trying to deal with the year 2000 
computer bug. So-called. But it appears one Pentagon agency may not 
be as ready to handle the problem as it previously had reported. Carl 
Rochelle has the story. The safety and security of the United States' 
stockpile of nuclear weapons is one mission of the defense special 
weapons agency. But the Pentagon's inspector general says the agency's 
report about the readiness of critical computer systems to deal with 
the year 2000 computer problems were not accurate. The inspector general's 
audit report found the agency -- "did not complete independent testing 
of three mission critical systems before classifying them as Y2K compliant." 
The Y2K glitch may cause older computers to fail to recognize the 
year 2000, leading them to instead recycle to 1900. Those computers 
have to be reprogrammed to handle the problem. One member of the congressional 
committee overseeing the agency says it's a Problem, but one that 
can be dealt with. So I'm pleased that we were able to learn about 
this 13 months ahead of time. I am not pleased that the problem exists. 
But there certainly is sufficient time for us to address the issue. 
The agency acknowledged the problem and promised to review all systems 
currently certified as compliant and change their status, if necessary, 
until the proper documentation is completed. Additionally, the agency 
agreed to develop contingency plans for all mission-critical systems 
and to update plans to address Y2K issues. Pentagon officials say 
the problem has been taken care of, the computer systems are now compliant 
for the year 2000 and the paperwork is being updated. They say the 
problem was a result of the agency working off of a set of rules that 
had not been updated to the ones being used by the inspector general's 
office. Carl Rochelle, CNN, Washington.
