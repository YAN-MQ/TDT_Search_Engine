Russell bivins, "CNN Headline Sports." Wanda, you're bringing in Elliot, 
the consultant? I just thought that-- how are we going to work with 
this guy? - He's a thousand miles away! - And I'm sure that-- he doesn't 
think the way we think. Well, I think that that's the point. Uh-oh, 
wanda's team is upset. They have to share everything they know with 
someone they don't. What kind of conversation are we going to have 
with Elliot? He doesn't even use the same systems we use. Relax, wanda. 
Remember, you've got Xerox docushare. The software that works on any 
system. Huh, you're right. Of course we're right! No, I mean, I know 
exactly how to get you guys... and Elliot on the same page. But that'll 
never happen. Sure it will. With docushare, you all can work on the 
same digital documents on the same webpage. We don't have time to 
train this guy. - What training? - It's intuitive. Anyone can use 
a web browser. see? You share documents with Elliot. Elliot shares 
with you. - Why do we have to share anything with Elliot? - Because... 
- he's got the knowledge. - Tell them he's writing a book. Because 
I said so! That's a good answer too.
