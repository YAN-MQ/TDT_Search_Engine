South African Hennie Walters, aided by a practice putting contraption, 
led defending champion Nick Price and two other players by one shot 
Saturday in the Zimbabwe Open golf championship. ``I have a plastic-and-metal 
putting aid which forces the putter in practice to travel along a 
fixed groove so as to make you repeat the stroke exactly. It certainly 
worked for me today,'' said Walters after posting a third-round lead 
of 207. Price shot a one under par 71 for a total of 208. He struggled 
to find some sparkle in front of his expectant home country fans, 
managing just three birdies but also dropping two shots. Price's 54 
holes score is matched by Darren Fitchardt and Tjaart van der Walt, 
both of South Africa. Another South African, Andrew McLardy, is on 
210, three strokes back, while Price's main Zimbabwe rivals Tony Johnstone, 
on 211, and Mark McNulty, on 212, have outside chances of snatching 
the title. However, another Zimbabwean, Marc Cayeux, who won the Zambia 
Open last week, has also moved into the picture. Beginning the tournament 
with a 77, he followed up with a 68 and then 67 for a 212 score. The 
course record of 66 was equalled Saturday by three players, Canada's 
Doug McGuigan, Richard Fulford of South Africa and McLardy. These 
six under par scores moved them all into contention, with McGuigan 
on 212 and Fulford on 213. Although not at his best in the third round, 
Price still has a good chance Sunday to win his third Zimbabwe Open 
in four years and become the first player to successfully defend the 
title. Such is Price's magnetism and stature here that the organizers 
moved up Sunday's play by 40 minutes at his request so that he can 
immediately fly to a new course called Leopard Creek on the edge of 
Kruger Park, South Africa's biggest wildlife sanctuary, where he will 
play a charity singles match Monday against Ernie Els.
