If you're juggling meetings and memos and projects and feel like you 
need an extra brain, there's good news. Technology can give you one, 
sort of. Tony Guida explains. The palm pilot. It's as small as your 
hand and, in some ways, way ahead of your brain. Well, I have like 
900 people in here that I call every day. And I have 120 or so documents 
that I'm working on. Retailing for $370, the palm 3 is the market 
leader in the latest, greatest gadget category -- the handheld computer, 
also known as a "Pda," or personal digital assistant. The devices 
that you see today are finally easy to use. Used to be, the devices 
we saw a couple of years ago were really science projects or smart 
calculators, or they were really only used by the nerds, who were 
willing to take the time and energy to learn how to make these things 
run. Most palm pilotors, though, learn an easy, shorthand language 
based on handwriting, making the pilot best for simple, not complex, 
work. If I'm going to write a document, I don't want a keyboard that's 
this big, you know. I might as well use my real keyboard, right? He's 
taking a swipe at handhelds with small keyboards and more memory and 
power, like this $550 psyion series 5 or this $1,000 hewlett-Packard 
660 LX, which runs windows ce, an operating system more like that 
on your desktop. But all handhelds have limitations. The downsides 
are it's a little harder to check your E-mail, for example. Still, 
handhelds weigh less than three pounds, with batteries that can last 
30 hours. That's "your money." Tony Guida, "CNN Financial News," New 
York.
