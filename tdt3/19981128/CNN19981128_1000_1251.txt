Friday college football, and the day no doubt belonged the longhorn's 
Ricky williams. The senior became the leading rusher in division ia 
history as Texas topped the aggies 26-24. Tony dorsett held the record 
for 22 years. It's my last game at home, and running you running out 
in front of all the fans and the fans going crazy. And "run Ricky 
run" everywhere. It was just a great feeling.
