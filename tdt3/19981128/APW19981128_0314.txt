The S-300 anti-aircraft missiles that Cyprus has bought from Russia 
will be deployed in Cyprus despite Turkish threats and Greek disapproval, 
the Cypriot foreign minister said Saturday. The minister, Yiannakis 
Cassoulides, made the comments on his return from a Greek-Cyprus summit 
in Athens where the two countries failed to agree on the final destination 
of the missiles. The Greek government is against the deployment of 
the missiles in Cyprus to avoid being dragged into hostilities with 
Turkey, which has threatened to use military force to prevent the 
deployment. A Turkish action will automatically involve Greece under 
its joint defense pact with Cyprus. During the Athens summit Friday, 
Greek Premier Costas Simitis proposed setting up the missiles on the 
Greek island of Crete. But Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides refused 
to budge. The media in Greece and Cyprus described the talks as ``stormy'' 
Simitis, the Greek premier, also acknowledged that the final word 
rests with Cyprus. ``In this case, and any other case, the Cyprus 
government will decide and there will be consultations with Greece 
before hand.'' Cyprus has been criticized by the United States and 
the European Union for its stand. The missiles are expected to delivered 
in a month or two. Cassoulides said Cyprus is ready to cooperate with 
the international community for the reduction of tensions on the island 
through its demilitarization proposal, which is rejected by Turkey, 
and intensified efforts for the island's reunification. Cyprus has 
been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and a Turkish-occupied 
north since Turkey invaded and occupied its northern third in 1974. 
A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized 
by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops there.
