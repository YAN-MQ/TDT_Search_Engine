hundreds of authorities are scouring the woods near huntsville, texas, 
looking for a death row inmate who escaped from a nearby prison. authorities 
say they believe 29-year-old convicted killer, martin gurule, is still 
in the area. he and six other inmates got out of their cells thursday. 
the six were soon caught, but gurule scaled two razor-topped fences. 
he was sentenced to die for killing two people at a corpus christi 
restaurant in 1992. it's the first time a condemned killer has escaped 
from a texas prison in 64 years.
