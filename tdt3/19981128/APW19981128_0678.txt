Four people were killed Saturday when their car detonated a land mine 
left over from Yemen's 1994 civil war, police said. The car was driving 
along a sand road near the city of Lahj, 35 kilometers (21 miles) 
north of the southern port of Aden, when the mine exploded, a policeman 
said. The blast killed three women and a man. A fifth passenger was 
wounded, the policeman said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
He did not give the victims' names. An estimated 100,000 land mines 
were planted during Yemen's civil war. They have killed and maimed 
hundreds of people.
