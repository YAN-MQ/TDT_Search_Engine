The most influential person in Sudan's government, parliamentary Speaker 
Hassan Turabi, appeared to have decided to resign Saturday. Deputy 
Speaker Ellison Magaia was quoted by the official Egyptian news agency 
MENA as saying that Turabi would resign in order to devote his time 
to the National Congress, which is effectively the ruling party. ``Turabi 
will continue heading the assembly until it approves next year's budget 
on Dec. 17,'' MENA quoted Magaia as saying after a meeting of leading 
legislators Saturday. Earlier in the day, the president's legal adviser, 
Abdel-Basit Sabdarat, announced that his chief would not ``intervene 
in the selection'' of a new speaker, the official news agency SUNA 
reported. Sabdarat did not say that Turabi was leaving, but the announcement 
set the stage for such a resignation. The government newspaper Al-Anbaa 
had reported Tuesday that Turabi would be retiring as speaker. Al-Anbaa 
said Turabi would announce his resignation before a new law that legalizes 
``political associations'' takes effect on Jan. 1. Political parties 
have been banned since the military seized power in 1989. Turabi has 
not responded to the reports, but earlier this year he expressed a 
desire to leave Parliament. Turabi is widely regarded as the principal 
ideologue of the military-backed government of President Omar el-Bashir. 
His departure from the speakership is not expected to reduce his role 
as the power behind the scenes.
