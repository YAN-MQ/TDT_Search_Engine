Senator-elect Jim Bunning of Kentucky says democrats talk a good political 
game on social security, but they have failed to deliver promised 
reforms. In the republican radio address, Bunning says the next Congress 
has a Golden opportunity to fix the retirement system before it goes 
broke. He claims that's what the people want. The message from the 
elections of 199, the message I got on my bus tour of kentucky and 
the message that came out of every election around the nation is that 
social security must be strengthened and reformed. We need to take 
politics out of social security, stop the distortion and get down 
to work. The government says if something isn't done to reform social 
security, it could begin running in the red in 20 years.
