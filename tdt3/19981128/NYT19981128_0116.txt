NATIONAL FORECAST Record warmth is expected Sunday from the central 
Plains to the Atlantic Seaboard. High pressure centered over the Southeast 
will circulate very mild air from the southwest into the East. Readings 
will rise 15 to 30 degrees above seasonal levels from Kansas to the 
Middle Atlantic coast. Sunshine will prevail east of the lower Mississippi 
Valley and as far north as Maryland. A Canadian air mass will keep 
central and northern New England seasonal as clouds lower and thicken 
ahead of a warm front. There will be a few showers inland late in 
the day. Moisture will stream out of the western Gulf into the southern 
Plains and central Mississippi Valley. Morning fog will be common 
in this area with scattered showers developing by afternoon. Low pressure 
over Minnesota will summon the moisture into the western Great Lakes 
with widespread clouds and patches of rain, especially north of the 
warm front. A chillier air mass will push eastward from the Rockies 
into the northwest Plains. Mixed rain and snow are likely in the western 
Dakotas with periods of wet snow in the higher elevations of eastern 
Utah. A disturbance over the southern Rockies will trigger some showers 
and gusty winds. A few thunderstorms should erupt Sunday night in 
western Texas. More tranquil conditions are expected in southern California 
and parts of Nevada. Another front will reach the Northwest with heavy 
rain and increasing wind west of the Cascades. Snow levels will get 
lower in the mountains while a few showers dampen the interior. Focus: 
Second Summer During the latter part of autumn, a second summer often 
comes. Indian summer is the name given to a late autumn period of 
abnormally warm weather accompanied by sunny, hazy days and cool nights. 
While there is no official definition, a killing frost must precede 
the warm spell in order for it to be considered true Indian summer. 
The origin of the term most likely relates to the way American Indians 
used these last mild days to increase their winter stores. For the 
next few days, a spell of Indian summer with near record warmth will 
envelop most of the eastern half of the nation.
