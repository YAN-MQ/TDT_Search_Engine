Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising a thorough 
review of his country's military occupation of southern Lebanon. Pressure 
is growing in Israel for a withdrawal of troops after bomb attacks 
in the occupied zone have killed seven Israeli soldiers in the last 
11 days. Netanyahu will meet with his cabinet Sunday to discuss the 
issue. In April, the cabinet adopted a 1978 U.N. resolution that called 
for israeli troops to withdraw immediately from southern Lebanon, 
but said it would do so only with security guarantees from Lebanon.
