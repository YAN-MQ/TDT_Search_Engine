An off-duty emergency medical technician was struck and killed by 
an unmarked police car after he stepped off a bus in Brooklyn early 
Saturday, police said. The police car, containing three officers, 
was chasing two other cars that had been speeding and swerving along 
Broadway near Hooper Street in the Williamsburg section, police said. 
They said the victim, Arnold John, 47, of 1074 Eastern Parkway in 
Crown Heights, Brooklyn, was struck just after he left a city bus 
on Broadway near Woodhull Hospital at 2:55 a.m. The three officers 
in the unmarked car were not injured. The car, driven by Officer James 
Bodnar, had been chasing a BMW and a Honda Accord east on Broadway 
after the officers observed the two cars playing ``road games,'' police 
said. The two other officers were not identified. The BMW turned off 
Broadway, and the police car turned on its dashboard light and siren 
and continued to follow the Honda, police said. John stepped off the 
rear of a westbound bus traveling in the center lane of Broadway, 
moments after the Honda passed, police said. John walked into the 
street to get to the curb and was hit by the police car, they said. 
After the collision, an officer leapt from the car and ran into the 
hospital to get assistance. John was taken to the hospital emergency 
room, where he was pronounced dead at 3:50 a.m., police said. Police 
said officers did not get the license number of the Honda but were 
looking for the BMW. The death is being investigated by the Accident 
Investigation Team, police said. Prosecutors are also investigating 
the accident, said Patrick Clark, a spokesman for District Attorney 
Charles Hynes of Brooklyn. A law enforcement official, who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity, said two nonpolice witnesses, including 
the bus driver, confirmed the officer's account of the accident. ``They 
were in a legitimate response; they saw the speeder and were required 
to respond,'' the official said. The police car was traveling faster 
than 30 mph, but less than 50 mph, the official said. Friends and 
co-workers of John said they wanted more details about the incident. 
Richard McAllan, a member of the executive board of Emergency Medical 
Service Union, said that even if the officer was traveling to an emergency, 
police _ like ambulance drivers _ have a responsibility to drive at 
a speed that would allow the driver to stop or swerve to avoid pedestrians 
or other cars. ``It won't change the tragedy,'' McAllan said. ``But 
if these guys were in an emergency situation it would be different 
than if these guys were just hot-rodding around.'' John, who had been 
an emergency medical technician for a little more than three years, 
worked in the back of ambulances and administered aid to victims, 
said Ronald Mainor, John's partner. Mainor said that his friend was 
a calming influence, both on colleagues and on the injured. ``He didn't 
make light, but he helped ease the anxiety,'' Mainor said. ``That's 
a gift he had.'' John was married, with a son and daughter. His friends 
and relatives said they were devastated by the accident. ``He was 
a very hard-working person,'' said Wilfred Lewis, John's brother-in-law, 
``dedicated to his job and a dedicated father.'' Mourners visited 
John's apartment Saturday afternoon to see his wife, Veronica John. 
``The Lord give me strength,'' Mrs. John repeated over and over again, 
as she clutched her husband's emergency medical technician uniform. 
``I'm empty, right now _ just empty. I can't function.''
