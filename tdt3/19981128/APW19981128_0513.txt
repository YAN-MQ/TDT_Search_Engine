Rebel troops on the frontline of a Congolese government counteroffensive 
know little about a cease-fire agreement reached in Paris between 
the government and the rebels' foreign backers _ and say they care 
even less. Standing on a bridge straddling the brown waters of the 
Congo River, rebel commander Gabriel said he had heard that President 
Laurent Kabila had agreed to the ceasefire only through news reports. 
``Rwandans and Ugandans can agree upon whatever they want, but I am 
a Congolese and I have a war to fight,'' Gabriel, who only uses his 
first name, said of his erstwhile backers. ``We have started this 
war to kick Kabila out. We shall finish it.' French President Jacques 
Chirac announced that Rwanda, Uganda and Congo had reached a consensus 
to stop the four-month war in a cease-fire brokered by U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan at the end of a summit of African leaders in Paris. Rebel 
leaders, who did not take part in the summit, were not signatories. 
One rebel leader, Arthur Ngoma, had been scheduled to attend the summit 
as an observer, but he was unavailable for comment. Rebel leaders 
have urged Kabila to directly negotiate with them, something the Congolese 
president has been refusing since Aug. 2 when minority Tutsis, disenchanted 
members of his army and opposition politicians took up arms. They 
have been backed in arms, troops and equipment by their allies in 
Rwanda and Uganda, who accuse Kabila of enlisting in war thousands 
of Rwandan and Ugandan insurgents. Previous efforts by African diplomats 
to broker a cease-fire have failed over Kabila's refusal to negotiate 
with them, and more recently, rebel obstacles to African peace proposals. 
Rebel leaders were planning to attend another round of peace talks 
sponsored by the Southern Africa Development Community in Pretoria 
next month. Kabila has refused to attend those talks in the past, 
demanded that Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw from Congo, something 
both countries have ruled out without a prior peace agreement and 
security guarantees for their borders. In Kabalo, a front-line town 
deep in tropical forest 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of the rebel 
eastern stronghold at Goma, pro-Kabila Zimbabwean jet fighters striking 
at towns and rebel army convoys had brought rebel advances to a halt. 
Apart from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad are also propping up 
Kabila. At the Nzofu Bridge over the Congo, 14 kilometers (8 miles) 
west of Kabalo, guns fell silent on Saturday. But Gabriel, the rebel 
commander, said Zimbabweans had been seen regrouping on the other 
side and he expected more fighting to follow. ``We are fighting against 
Kabila's mismanagement, corruption and tribalism. This war will end 
up in (capital) Kinshasa,'' he said.
