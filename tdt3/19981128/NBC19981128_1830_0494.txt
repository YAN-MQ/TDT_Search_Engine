To Iraq now, where U.N. inspectors today continued their search for 
weapons of mass destruction. No confrontations, but no reported discoveries 
either. Saddam Hussein continues to claim there is nothing to find. 
He also complains that the U.N.'s economic sanctions are destroying 
Iraq. But when NBC's Ron Allen took a look, he found a tale of two 
baghdads. For most Iraqis sanctions only mean suffering, children 
dying in hospitals, long lines for food rations -- once prosperous 
people, auctioning everything they own to feed their families. But 
there's something else here the outside world rarely ever sees. Saturday 
night, places like saddoon street -- it's shop till you drop -- consumer 
goods from around the world smuggled into Iraq despite what's supposed 
to be a total ban on trade. Perfumes from Paris. Crystal from the 
Czech republic. Levis, Calvin Klein, the latest fashions at bennetton 
-- just like those in any suburban mall. And the owner says business, 
despite sanctions, isn't bad at all. Even if you double these sanctions, 
we will survive. This is a promise. All kinds of consumer goods are 
finding their way across the border into this country, because after 
eight years of sanctions, many of the neighboring Arab countries think 
the people here have suffered long enough. Now you can get anything 
you want here for a price. You have Mercedes? A few. bmw? yes. Makiya's 
car dealership has some of the latest models. No problem getting cars 
into the country, they say, but not many customers who can pay the 
price, $28,000 for this sporty BMW smuggled in from Jordan. This is 
a good car? Yes, a very good car. Across town, the latest computer 
technology, even Windows 98 in arabic, and it's all inexpensive. Pentium 
processors for $900, digital cameras for $250 -- most of it imported 
from friendly Islamic countries. It's very easy. Even though there 
are sanctions? Sometimes it's difficult, but sometimes it's very easy. 
U.N. officials here can't even begin to estimate the value of goods 
being smuggled through Iraq's increasingly porous borders. An illegal 
trade creating a tiny consumer paradise and earning lots of money 
for a few, all of this making life more comfortable for Iraq's new 
elite -- those close to a regime much of the world wants to punish. 
Ron Allen, NBC news, Baghdad.
