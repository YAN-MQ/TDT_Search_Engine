Bad weather and declining commodity prices have ended Guyana's seven 
straight years of robust growth and slowed the economy, said Finance 
Minister Bharrat Jagdeo. Exports have declined and the Gross Domestic 
Product is expected to decline 1.8 percent this year instead of growing 
3.2 percent, as originally projected, Jagdeo said at a press briefing 
Friday evening. Exports of sugar, still the country's principal foreign 
currency earner, dropped by 10 percent and timber and other forest 
products dropped 23.9 percent, he said. Guyana suffered an extended 
drought last year that damaged a variety of crops and was blamed on 
weather patterns caused by El Nino. The South American country also 
relies on exports of gold and bauxite, and prices for such commodities 
have been low this year, in part due to the worldwide economic slowdown. 
Jagdeo said inflation was 4 percent.
