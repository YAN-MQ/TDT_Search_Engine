Israeli warplanes on Saturday raided suspected guerrilla bases in 
southern Lebanon, a day after two Israeli soldiers were killed in 
a guerrilla roadside bombing. Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface 
missiles on the hills between the villages of Siddiqine and Jebal 
al-Butom, 28 kilometers (17 miles) southwest of this southern market 
town. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the air raid, 
said the Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
The missile attack occurred hours after an ambush by Hezbollah guerrillas 
on Israeli soldiers who were trying to retrieve a disabled military 
vehicle near the Lebanon-Israel border, the Hezbollah said in a statement. 
It did not mention any casualties. There was no independent confirmation 
of the ambush, which Hezbollah said took place just before midnight. 
On Friday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in a roadside bombing 
near the border claimed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah. Two Israeli 
soldiers also were killed on Wednesday. The casualties raised to seven 
the number of Israeli soldiers killed in southern Lebanon in the last 
10 days. Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops 
and their allied Lebanese militiamen from a occupied zone in southern 
Lebanon that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern territories 
from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Following the recent Israeli 
casualties, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a trip to 
Europe and retuned home for a meeting with Cabinet ministers and army 
generals scheduled for Sunday to review the Lebanon policy. However, 
Netanyahu said he would only pull Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon 
if this did not expose northern Israel to attacks by Hezbollah, a 
Shiite Muslim group. Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government 
is willing to give such a guarantee. ``We will not act as border police 
for Israel and will not give (it) security guarantees,'' Ammar Musawi, 
a Hezbollah representative in Parliament, said in an interview broadcast 
Saturday. Musawi also threatened to hit back at Israel if it strikes 
at Lebanese infrastructure in retaliation to guerrilla attacks. ``The 
resistance will not stand idle if the infrastructure and civilians 
are targeted,'' he told the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation television. 
Avigdor Kahalani, the Israeli public security minister, had called 
on Israel Friday to attack Beirut and knock out electricity and water 
services there.
