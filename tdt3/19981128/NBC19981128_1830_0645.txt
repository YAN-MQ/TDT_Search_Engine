Nearby, Israelis and Palestinians are continuing their on again, off 
again push towards peace. There is always reason for optimism and 
pessimism. Here's Martin Fletcher. The peace process mideast-style, 
Palestinians today demanding the release of prisoners in Israeli jails, 
challenging Israeli police and troops the traditional way. The peace 
process is a roller coaster, with its good days and bad days. A triumphant 
day for Palestinians this week, when they opened their first airport 
in Gaza. A delighted Yasser Arafat and delighted Palestinians, as 
more and more towns and villages see Palestinian police taking the 
places of Israeli soldiers. It's what they struggled for so long and 
so hard. In this town the Israeli occupation is over. Over the next 
three months, Arafat is scheduled to extend his control over 40% of 
the West Bank. It looks like this. Palestinian-controlled areas, dotting 
the land like a leopard skin. Slowly, Israel is turning over control 
of more land in between Jewish settlements in the West Bank. But the 
Palestinians want all the land. Israel wants to keep as much as possible. 
And to protect its Settlements, Israel is building security roads 
that are cutting through ancient hillsides, uprooting trees owned 
by Palestinians, keeping one Palestinian community separate from another. 
There is a school of thought which says that somehow if the West Bank 
is broken up into isolated cantons, it represents less of a threat 
to Israel. And it leads to yet more clashes. Both sides staked out 
their positions before the start of final status talks where the really 
tough decisions will have to be made, including the frontiers of a 
future Palestinian state. For Palestinians, the West Bank land is 
their state. For Israelis, the land is their security. Peace means 
finding a compromise. The search is just beginning. Martin Fletcher, 
NBC, on the West Bank.
