Faith Carey-Proctor's dream of expanding her hair-braiding business 
is on hold. More precisely, it is stacked against the inside wall 
of a building she rents downtown, where there are dog-eared cardboard 
boxes of lotions and sprays, desk drawers full of combs, and a shopping 
cart loaded with rollers and hair extensions, an occasional curl twined 
through the bars. Ms. Carey-Proctor is one of four African-American 
hair braiders who have sued the Ohio Board of Cosmetology for what 
they say are unfair and burdensome licensing requirements. If the 
lawsuit, which seeks to change the regulations, is successful, Ms. 
Carey-Proctor plans to remodel and expand the business Faithfully 
Yours, which she and her sister started two years ago. Otherwise, 
she says she will go back to braiding at home, which she has been 
doing, without a license, for 17 years. In either case, Ms. Carey-Proctor 
said she was not worried about losing clients. ``Hair means a lot 
to a woman,'' she said. ``We have some clients who are balding, but 
we can build them a head of hair. ``If they have to go underground 
with us, they will,'' she said. In taking their case to court, Ms. 
Carey-Proctor, her sister Cassandra Taylor, and Cheryll Hosey and 
Michael Martin from the It's My Business Hair Braiding Gallery in 
Youngstown are not alone. Hair braiders in other states also have 
protested against cosmetology licenses requiring experience in perming, 
tinting and cutting, which the braiders never use, and offering little 
or no training in a form of hair styling that has been handed down 
through generations of black families _ twisting, braiding and weaving 
in extensions. Similar lawsuits have been filed in New York, California 
and Texas, and braiders have won exemption from some regulations in 
Washington, D.C., Maryland and Michigan. Ohio hair braiders must now 
obtain a cosmetology license to operate. This requires 1,500 hours 
of training _ considerably more than the 446 hours needed to become 
a police officer _ and the training costs thousands of dollars, takes 
nearly a year and uses chemicals and thermal processing, the staples 
of mainstream cosmetology. The cosmetology board twice told Ms. Carey-Proctor 
to close her business and then threatened to charge her with a fourth-degree 
misdemeanor for operating a business without a license. Ms. Carey-Proctor 
sought the help of the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit public-interest 
organization based in Washington, which takes on ``economic liberty'' 
cases. ``This is a classic example of the government interfering with 
people's right to earn a living,'' said Dana Berliner, a lawyer with 
the institute, which filed the braiders' lawsuit last year. ``Braiding 
is something my clients love to do, and it gives them a chance to 
be entrepreneurs. They could go to nursing school and learn as much 
about braiding as they would in cosmetology school.'' But Dave Williamson, 
the executive director of the cosmetology board, said the training 
ensures that braiders learn about health and safety precautions, like 
recognizing certain skin conditions. He said he was also concerned 
about the livelihoods of licensed black cosmetologists, who sometimes 
do braiding. ``They worked hard to build their businesses in these 
communities,'' Williamson said. ``It creates a problem when there 
are some folks providing these services who are licensed and others 
who are not.'' Recently, the braiders and their lawyers testified 
in support of a bill introduced by state Rep. Vermel Whalen, D-Cleveland, 
that would make it easier for braiders to receive licenses. Ms. Whalen, 
who began working on the bill five years ago, said she was concerned 
that cosmetology licensing regulations might keep women without education 
or resources from earning a living. ``With welfare reform on our plates, 
I saw this as an economic-development piece,'' Ms. Whalen said. ``I 
definitely thought we should stop the hair police from making criminals 
out of law-abiding citizens.'' Indeed, Ms. Carey-Proctor was chagrined 
to find herself accused of breaking the law. She said that a neighborhood 
drug dealer taunted her after her legal troubles began. ``I always 
told him he'd wind up going to jail some day,'' she said. ``After 
all this happened, he came in and told me that it looked like I might 
be going to jail, too.''
