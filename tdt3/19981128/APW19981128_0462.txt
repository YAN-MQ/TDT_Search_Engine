Talks on establishing a compensation fund for former Nazi slave laborers 
are near completion between government and industry leaders, a news 
magazine reported Saturday. U.S. Ambassador John Kornblum and Israeli 
Ambassador Avi Primor are helping negotiate the industry-wide fund 
which will be administered by the government, according to Der Spiegel. 
Before taking office in October, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government 
decided to establish a fund to settle back-wage claims and lawsuits 
from concentration camp inmates forced to work for German companies 
during World War II. Slave laborers have not been eligible for back 
wages under postwar German laws on reparations for Nazi victims. Estimates 
on the number of slave laborers run as high as 9 million, many of 
them Jews from eastern Europe. Schroeder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, 
will spend the early weeks of December meeting with companies to determine 
how much they will contribute to the fund, the magazine reported. 
Among those participating are Allianz insurance company, Dresdner 
and Deutsche banks, DaimlerChrysler, Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens, Krupp, 
Degussa and BASF. Opposing the fund are former slave laborers who 
have called on the German government to recognize their right to settle 
their claims individually or on a class-action basis. A group has 
filed a New York lawsuit seeking a portion of company profits.
