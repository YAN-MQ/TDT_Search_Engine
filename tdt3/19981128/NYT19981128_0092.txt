Leaders of Congo and neighboring countries giving support to armed 
rebels in the central African country agreed Saturday under U.N. auspices 
to sign a cease-fire agreement by mid-December, said President Jacques 
Chirac of France. Chirac said that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
had secured promises to end the fighting in meetings with eight African 
leaders held Saturday morning. With Annan by his side as the summit 
ended in the Louvre Museum, Chirac said, ``The hope is that the signing 
of a cease-fire should take place before the meeting of the Organization 
of African Unity in Ouagadougou on Dec. 17 and 18.'' Ouagadougou is 
the capital of Burkina Faso. Chirac took care not to say that the 
fighting was over, and did not say whether the rebels, whom he had 
not invited to the meeting, had been consulted. ``Everybody has moved 
a bit and all we can do now is support the efforts by the secretary 
general and the Organization of African Unity to end this situation, 
which is as absurd as it is lethal,'' he said. Annan met with Congo 
President Laurent Kabila and leaders of neighboring states, including 
Angola, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda. Chirac described the meetings 
as ``tense but not hostile.'' Angola and Zimbabwe have been backing 
Congo's leader, whose forces last year drove out a regime long backed 
by France that was headed by Mobutu Sese Seko. The country was then 
known as Zaire. Uganda and Rwanda, which helped Kabila win power in 
1997, quarreled with him and are now backing rebels fighting his regime 
in eastern Congo. French television showed Kabila glowering at Uganda's 
President Yoweri Museveni and at Rwanda's leader, Pasteur Bizimungu, 
as Annan talked. ``They have committed themselves to accepting a cease-fire, 
and they also decided to accept an immediate end of hostilities,'' 
Annan said later. Given Kabila's spotty record on putting his signature 
to agreements reached verbally, it was difficult to say what would 
actually happen on the ground in Africa. ``What accord? I have not 
signed any accord,'' Kabila said after the announcement by Chirac, 
who received him in his office in Elysee Palace later. ``I think there 
is no reason to doubt his word,'' Chirac said before the meeting. 
A year ago, Kabila wriggled out of an agreement that Bill Richardson, 
then the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations, said he had negotiated 
to permit an international investigation into the massacre of tens 
of thousands of ethnic Hutu refugees during Kabila's victory sweep 
across the country. Asked about signing a cease-fire in mid-December, 
Kabila said Saturday: ``It's possible, but we have to prepare an accord. 
We will find a solution, we will do everything possible.'' Bizimungu 
of Rwanda said, ``I do not think we have advanced.'' But, he added, 
``It was not useless, it's better than a breakup.'' The rebellion 
is rooted in the ethnic conflicts between the Hutu and Tutsi populations 
in central Africa that led to the massacre of half-a-million people 
in Rwanda in 1994. The Hutu organizers of the killings fled into refugee 
camps in Congo and used the camps as bases for attacks on Rwanda. 
To fight back, the Tutsi-led government in Rwanda supported Kabila's 
uprising in 1996. But tens of thousands of Hutu refugees _ 180,000 
people, according to the United Nations _ disappeared as they were 
driven across Congo by Kabila's advancing army in 1996 and 1997, prompting 
French human rights groups to press Paris prosecutors unsuccessfully 
to bring criminal charges against him while he was here. The Paris 
prosecutor's office declined Friday to take action, saying Kabila 
had immunity as head of state. France, which had regarded Kabila's 
takeover of Congo last year as a U.S.-backed plot to reduce French 
influence in its former African colonies, improved relations with 
him this fall. Conversely, the United States, which had given up on 
Congo's former dictator, Mobutu, long before France did, now has lost 
its earlier ardor for Kabila and, diplomats say, is doing what it 
can to cooperate with the French to help end the fighting in Congo. 
The French summary of the summit proceedings here reported: ``The 
presidents of the Republic of Uganda and of Rwanda reaffirmed their 
readiness for a cease-fire that the presidents and heads of delegation 
of Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad also said they wanted as soon 
as conditions permit.''
