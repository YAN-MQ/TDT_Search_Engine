Two people are dead after a metro bus in Seattle careened off a bridge 
friday and plunged into an apartment building 50 feet below. Police 
say the bus driver lost control after being shot in the arm, allegedly 
by a passenger. More than 30 people are injured. Authorities say the 
driver was thrown from the bus and killed. They say a second man, 
who had gunshot wounds, died later. A Seattle police officer tells 
CNN he thinks the shooter is in custody. Authorities are investigating 
the shooting as a homicide. They say it's not immediately clear what 
led to the shooting.
