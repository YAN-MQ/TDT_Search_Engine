Across the country, it has been a tough time finding a parking spot 
outside malls and shopping centers. Retailers opened early Friday, 
slashed prices and did whatever else it took to attract customers 
on the traditional opening day of the holiday shopping season. Merchants 
and retail analysts alike have been voicing quiet optimism about this 
year's prospects. As shoppers trudged through the malls, many appeared 
to be in a spending mood, despite some jitters in the economy this 
fall. I feel very excited about the economy, so I'm not going to limit 
myself. I'm going to feel happy in shopping. I feel exhilarated, and 
I'm not going to stop my shopping because what may have happened in 
the stock market. Not everyone was lining up at the local mall. A 
lot of people let their "windows" do the walking. According to one 
survey, 43% of computer users will buy some of their holiday gifts 
over the Internet this year. That's three times the number who shopped 
online only a year ago. We'll have more on the outlook for retailers 
in our "Dollars & Sense" report at 46 minutes past the hour.
