A fundamentalist Muslim lawmaker has vowed to stop a shopping festival 
planned in February, saying a stagnant economy cannot be improved 
by singers and moral corruption, a newspaper reported Saturday. Organizers 
from private and public sectors have said the shop-till-you-drop extravaganza 
would feature music concerts and dance troupes, a rarity in this conservative 
Muslim country. Several religious organizations have criticized the 
planned event as a cause for corruption. Music concerts in Kuwait 
need to be approved by authorities, and when they are, audiences are 
forbidden from dancing. The festival, the first of its kind in Kuwait, 
is aimed at giving an economy ailing from low oil prices a shot in 
the arm. ``National economy cannot be activated by a singer from here, 
and a singer from there,'' Parliament member Muabarak al-Duwailah 
said in comments published by Al-Watan daily. Al-Duwailah said fundamentalists 
will continue to pressure the government to intervene and cancel the 
festival, al-Watan reported. If government ministers do not cooperate, 
Islamists will have to take other steps, al-Duwailah said. He did 
not elaborate. Fundamentalists form the second largest bloc in the 
non-partisan 50-member Parliament, after government supporters.
