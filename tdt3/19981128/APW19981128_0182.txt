Saudi authorities on Saturday chopped off the right hand of an Ethiopian 
man for stealing at Islam's holiest site in Mecca, the Interior Ministry 
said. Jamal Abdu Afkari was convicted of pick pocketing worshipers 
praying in the Grand Mosque next to the Kabaa, the focal point of 
Muslim prayers. Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law 
calls for cutting off the right hand of thieves. Murderers, rapists, 
drug traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded. Afkari's hand was 
cut off with a sword in the holy city of Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, 
the Interior Ministry said in a statement. This was the sixth amputation 
this year. Over the past few months, two Saudis, two Egyptians and 
an Afghan man have had their right hands cut off for pick pocketing. 
Executions and amputations are carried out with a sword in a public 
square. So far this year, Saudi Arabia has beheaded 26 people. Last 
year 124 people were executed.
