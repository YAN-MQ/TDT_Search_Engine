The governing Bharatiya Janata Party was headed for a rout in legislative 
elections in key states on Saturday, an apparent rebuke by the public 
for the 8-month-old Hindu nationalist government. The outcome has 
no bearing on the federal government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee. But a serious loss of prestige could stoke infighting in 
his shaky 19-party coalition and embolden the opposition Congress 
Party to try to unseat him if it wins enough defectors from the ruling 
alliance. Early results and trends showed the Congress Party ousting 
the sitting BJP government in the important states of New Delhi and 
Rajasthan, where it may win as many as three-fourths of the assembly 
seats in each state. The battle was closer in the Congress-ruled central 
state of Madhya Pradesh, but first results indicated Congress surprisingly 
would hold on to the state government. Regional parties were poised 
to dislodge the ruling Congress Party in the remote northeastern state 
of Mizoram. But the contest was deemed less important because the 
BJP did not contest it. More than 600 seats were contested in the 
four states in the voting Wednesday by about 5,000 candidates from 
dozens of political parties. A painful increase in the price of vegetables 
and staple foods hurt the BJP in the weeks before the election, wiping 
out any remaining credit it may have earned for its highly popular 
decision to conduct nuclear explosions last May. The election was 
the first political test for the BJP since it took office eight months 
ago. But it also was a key electoral test for the Congress Party's 
new leader, Sonia Gandhi, widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and 
torchbearer of the dynasty that gave India three prime ministers. 
Congress has said it will not make an immediate attempt to topple 
the government when Parliament convenes Monday for a three-week winter 
session. But it has said it would not ``shirk the responsibility'' 
if Vajpayee's coalition collapsed on its own. Gandhi has focused on 
rebuilding the Congress Party since she emerged from seclusion early 
this year to campaign in national elections. She was later named president 
of the party that was once led by her husband, his mother Indira Gandhi, 
and Indira's father Jawaharlal Nehru.
