Throughout his tempestuous career, Bryan Cox has often talked about 
how he has to play football on the ``edge,'' about how he ``can't 
lose that edge.'' But now he has toppled over that edge, again. When 
the New York Jets, after losing the injured linebacker Marvin Jones 
last summer, suddenly signed Cox, coach Bill Parcells did not try 
to put him on trial or on probation for having sometimes created chaos 
with the Miami Dolphins and the Chicago Bears in other years. ``Just 
be Bryan Cox,'' Parcells told him. But just being Bryan Cox is like 
being a time bomb, a danger to others and to himself. Although he 
had been on his best behavior since joining the Jets, anyone familiar 
with his past could hear this 6-foot-4-inch, 250-pound time bomb ticking. 
And the bomb finally exploded, in a relatively quiet locker room eruption. 
Upon learning of his $10,000 fine for unnecessary roughness in clubbing 
(without a penalty) both quarterback Steve McNair and running back 
Eddie George last Sunday in Tennessee, the 30-year-old Cox, who is 
black, calmly accused the National Football League of racism in its 
hierarchy. ``Although I'm unhappy about the fine, I will take the 
fine,'' he said. ``I don't want to be a person that's going to cause 
some conflict in this locker room. I'm trying to do the best that 
I can. We're in the middle of trying to make the best playoff run 
we can make.'' For six consecutive seasons, Cox has had at least one 
incendiary incident and nine over all at a total cost of $146,000 
in fines, believed to be an NFL career record. Now that the time bomb 
has exploded again, even calmly, is that all there is? Will he revert 
just to being a solid linebacker helping in the Jets' quest for the 
Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs? Or will Cox resume going tick, tick, tick, 
especially on Dec. 13, when the Jets are in Miami, where his split 
personality wore out his welcome, and again on Dec. 19 when the Jets 
are in Buffalo, where he feuded with and spit at Bills rooters while 
with the Dolphins? He hasn't been in Buffalo since a 1995 playoff 
game (which the Dolphins lost), when his running feud with the Bills' 
fans prompted the presence of more than two dozen county police in 
riot helmets behind the Dolphins' bench and both end zones in Rich 
Stadium. ``My intent is not to injure anybody,'' Cox said on Wednesday, 
``just to cause as much pain and hurt as I can.'' Causing pain and 
hurt is the mantra of every linebacker, but few acknowledge it as 
bluntly as Cox does. ``I don't have a three-piece suit and tie, and 
I'm not going to the stock market exchange,'' he has said. ``I hit 
people and hurt people for a living. I try to cause as much pain to 
somebody as I can.'' He also acknowledges his split personality. ``It's 
like I'm a schizophrenic,'' he has said. ``Some days I could have 
a chip on my shoulder for no reason and it doesn't take a lot to set 
me off. Other days I'm happy and excited and eager about life.'' Cox 
has a long NFL rap sheet of fines: One game's pay ($87,500 at the 
time) for an obscene gesture at a game official while with the Bears 
in 1996; $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000 for fighting; $5,000 for spitting 
at fans; $3,000 for an obscene gesture at fans (reduced from $10,000 
after the NFL agreed to ``maintain a work environment free from racial 
harassment'' in Buffalo); $5,000 for public criticism of game officials; 
$3,000 and now $10,000 for unnecessary roughness. When not wearing 
his football helmet, Cox, who has a wife and three children, has a 
reputation as a teddy-bear family man who has contributed his time 
and money to rebuilding a church in his East St. Louis, Ill., hometown, 
to his high school there and to a fitness center at his college, Western 
Illinois. In repose, he is considered a good guy, bright and articulate. 
But he is a good guy who has bad moments, all of them as an almost 
lethal linebacker. ``I don't care what people think,'' he has said. 
``I do my job the best I can, and I do what I think is right.'' In 
accusing the NFL of racism, Cox cited the absence of any African-American 
club owners, the presence of only three black head coaches, and the 
difficulty that black assistant coaches have in attaining head coaching 
status or even being interviewed to fill a head coaching vacancy _ 
each a valid argument. But in branding Gene Washington, the NFL dean 
of discipline who was once a star 49ers wide receiver, and Harold 
Henderson, its labor relations director, as token black executives 
pitted against the players, 70 percent of whom are black, Cox missed 
the tackle. If those jobs in the league office were being done by 
white executives, Cox would have a much better case. Instead, he is 
arguing racism both ways _ the absence of any black NFL club owners 
as well as the presence of two black league executives in important 
decision-making positions. As for his latest $10,000 fine, the Jets 
linebacker contended that ``if it was another player, I don't think 
that person would've been fined.'' But with his rap sheet, Bryan Cox 
is not about to get the benefit of the doubt. Time bombs never do.
