President Clinton has again acknowledged misleading the public about 
his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. But he's 
standing by what he said under oath about the matter. Mr. Clinton 
is back at the White House after Thanksgiving at camp David. In response 
to 81 questions from the house Judiciary committee, Mr. Clinton denies 
giving false or misleading testimony before the federal grand jury. 
And he says he never asked anyone to lie. Yesterday, the White House 
sent his responses to Capitol Hill. CNN legal analyst Roger Cossack 
says the president did not cover any new ground in his response. This 
is consistent with what the president and his people have said all 
along, particularly in this situation where they have come down to 
the definition of what a sexual relation really means to either Monica 
lewinsky, the president, or to both of them. Whether or not they were 
thinking the same thing. What the president has said here is what 
he had said all along. Look, if Monica Lewinsky defined sexual relations 
as two people having intercourse, then she was telling the truth and 
therefore I can say that she was telling the truth when she made these 
statements. House Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde issued a 
statement saying the committee will review the responses carefully. 
It's then planning to consider articles of impeachment the week of 
December 7th.
