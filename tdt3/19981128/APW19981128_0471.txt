Olympic silver medalist Barbara Niedernhuber shattered the Altenberg 
course record Saturday and led a German sweep of the first four places 
in women's singles at the luge World Cup race. Niedernhuber blazed 
to a new record of 53.858 seconds in her first run, breaking the old 
mark 54.78 by fellow German Sylke Otto by almost a second. She won 
in a combined time of one minute 47.823 seconds. "This is a puzzle 
to me," said Niedernhuber, who won her second career world cup race. 
"In the past, I've always been the first to crash at this course." 
In the doubles, the American men couldn't repeat their feat in the 
last world cup at Igls, Austria where they grabbed the top two spots. 
Tobias and Markus Schiegl of Austria swept first in 1:25.322 on the 
same course where the cousins captured the 1996 World Championships. 
Italians Gerhard Plankensteiner and Oswald Haselrieder were second 
in 1:25.428 while Americans Gordy Scheer and Chris Thorpe, the Olympic 
silver medalists settled for a bronze in 1:25.431. The U.S. junior 
world champions, Chris Niccum and Matt McLain, finished fourth in 
1:25.643 but remained first in the overall standings. The two 20-year-olds 
had captured the season opener. The two American teams were first 
and second after the first heats, with Niccum and McLain seizing the 
lead in 42.613, but mistakes on the lower end of the course cost them 
the race in the second heat. "It was a great race and the little mistakes 
hurt us," said Thorpe. German coach Thomas Schwab wasn't surprised 
by the complete domination of his team's women in the singles. "The 
track is in perfect condition and we've trained here for three weeks 
this year. Naturally that pays off," said Schwab. Otto finished second 
in the race in 1:47.986, followed by Olympic champion Silke Kraushaar 
in 1:47.998 and Susi Erdmann in 1:48.499.
