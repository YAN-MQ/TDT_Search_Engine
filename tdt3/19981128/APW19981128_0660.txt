South African Hennie Walters shot a 5-under-par 67 Saturday and moved 
one stroke ahead of a trio of players, including local hero Nick Price, 
to lead the Zimbabwe Open after three rounds. Despite bogeying No. 
10 when he missed a putt from less than a meter (3 feet), Walters 
birdied six others and will start Sunday's final round with a 9-under 
207. ``I have a plastic-and-metal putting aid which forces the putter 
in practice to travel along a fixed groove so as to make you repeat 
the stroke exactly. It certainly worked for me today,'' said Walters, 
who claimed he should have scored better after missing a string of 
putts inside 3 meters (10 feet). Price shot a 1-under 71 and was tied 
with South Africans Darren Fitchardt and Tjaart van der Walt, who 
had rounds of 69 and 71. Another South African Andrew McLardy was 
alone in fifth another two strokes back at 210 after a course-record 
equalling round of 66, one of three on the day. Zimbabwean Tony Johnstone 
was among a group of four at 211 after a 71 and compatriots Mark McNulty 
and Marc Cayeux were at 212 following rounds of 69 and 67. Cayeux 
has worked his way into a title chance after opening with a 77 on 
Thursday. Besides McLardy's 66, Canada's Doug McGuigan and South Africa's 
Richard Fulford also matched the course record. McGuigan was five 
strokes back with McNulty and Cayeux at 212 and Fulford was another 
stroke back. On Sunday, Price will be trying to win his third Zimbabwe 
Open title in four years and become the first player to sucessfully 
defend his title. Organizers have moved up the start of Sunday's play 
by 40 minutes at Price's request so he can fly to a new course called 
Leopard Creek on the edge of Kruger Park, South Africa's biggest wildlife 
sanctuary, and play a charity match on Monday against Ernie Els.
