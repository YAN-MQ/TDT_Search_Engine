Detectives are making headway in the investigation into the killing 
of a prominent Russian parliamentary leader, and are hoping to track 
down witnesses, the country's prosecutor general said Saturday. ``This 
is the first time we've had such a situation on our hands, when people 
are helping us very actively and there is a large amount of information 
that we immediately analyze,'' Yuri Skuratov said in a television 
interview. The Nov. 20 killing of liberal leader Galina Starovoitova 
is believed to have been a contract hit, a crime that is both common 
and very rarely solved in Russia. Skuratov said detectives are poring 
over material evidence left at the scene, and that they are close 
to finding people ``who could have witnessed this crime,'' according 
to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Starovoitova was one of the most prominent 
victims of violence in post-Soviet Russia, and her death has rallied 
liberal forces in the country and prompted numerous calls to crack 
down on lawlessness and violence.
