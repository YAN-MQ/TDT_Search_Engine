Rolando La Serie, one of the great Cuban singers of his time, died 
last Sunday at Healthsouth Doctors' Hospital in Coral Gables, Fla. 
He was 75. The cause was cardiac complications, The Associated Press 
reported. La Serie had a big, open voice, slightly hoarse and aggressive. 
Although some of his biggest hits were ballads, his up-tempo singing 
was a marvel of improvisation and sound. His attack and his enthusiasm 
earned him the nickname ``El Guapo de la Cancion,'' which in Cuban 
slang translates as valiant or bold singer. La Serie, from Santa Clara 
in Cuba, started out as a percussionist _ he was one of the original 
members of Beny More's group _ whose singing was seen as a bit of 
an embarrassment. But in 1956 he had the opportunity to record a ballad 
by Mario Fernandez Porta called ``Mentiras Tuyas,'' which he transformed 
with his distinctively hard sound. The composer of the song objected 
to La Serie's interpretation, but the record sold 30,000 copies in 
the first few days after its release. La Serie left Cuba soon after, 
traveling the world and living in Argentina and Mexico, which cost 
him his fame in his native country. But he maintained a busy schedule, 
recording with the music's biggest stars, even in exile from Cuba. 
He recorded in New York with Tito Puente and his band in the 1960's 
for an album called ``Pachanga in New York'' and with the great Puerto 
Rican band Cortijo y Su Combo, singing with Ismael Rivera. Along the 
way he continued to have hits, including ``Amalia Batista,'' now a 
Latin standard. He added tangos to his repertory, and his frequent 
interjection ``De pelicula!'' (``From a movie!'') became his trademark. 
In the 1970s he moved to Florida, and in the '80s he recorded with 
Johnny Pacheco on Fania Records. He also began recording with Caiman 
Records, which produced the fine album ``Ay, Se Paso La Serie,'' recorded 
in 1985 in a modern Cuban style. He is survived by his wife, Gisela.
