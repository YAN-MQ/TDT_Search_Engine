Greece and Egypt have begun a week-long joint naval exercise aimed 
at strengthening military ties between the two Mediterranean countries, 
defense officials here said Saturday. Two frigates from each country 
and other smaller vessels are participating in the exercises which 
began Friday off the Egyptian port of Alexandria. The ``Alexandria 
98'' maneuvers are part of a defense pact signed between the two countries 
when Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos visited Cairo earlier year. 
Greece has expressed concern over expanding military cooperation between 
Israel and its traditional rival Turkey. Egypt and Syria have also 
appeared wary of this cooperation.
