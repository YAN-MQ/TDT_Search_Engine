Senior ministers, prominent officials and top Kenyan businessman are 
among debtors who owe billions of Kenyan shillings to the national 
bank and to a number of troubled or recently collapsed banks, according 
to lists published Saturday. In a list released late Friday by the 
Central Bank of Kenya, senior Cabinet minister Nicholas Biwott and 
Raymond Moi, son of President Daniel arap Moi, were among the ministers, 
members of parliament and powerful businessmen with shares in companies 
owing huge commercial debts to several failed and failing institutions, 
newspaper reports said. The central bank report followed Thursday's 
presentation in parliament of a list of 87 companies, whose shareholders 
also include senior politicians and businessmen, which owe more than 
8.4 billion Kenyan shillings (about dlrs 140 million) to the National 
Bank of Kenya, according to the reports. Minister of Local Government 
Sam Ongeri, Minister of Public Works Kipkalya Kones and Deputy Speaker 
of the National Assembly Joab Amino were among the highest debtors, 
the independent Daily Nation newspaper said. Copies of the lists could 
not be attained Saturday. The disclosure provoked sharp criticism 
by opposition members of the National Assembly who called on the government 
to fire the bank's managers and take action to recover the funds, 
the East African Standard newspaper said. One legislator said the 
scandal was likely just the ``tip of the iceberg'' in high-level corruption. 
``For how long will over-burdened Kenyans continue to finance the 
lifestyles of a few thieves,'' Beth Mugo, a member of parliament for 
the Dagoretti Party, was quoted in the Standard as saying. Kenya has 
been plagued by financial corruption to such an extent that in 1997, 
the International Monetary Fund suspended a dlrs 220 million loan 
because it said the government had refused to tackle high level corruption. 
The national bank, which is in financial crisis, has long been seen 
as a milking fund for politicians and well-connected businessmen. 
Thursday's list of National Bank debtors was presented to parliament 
by Assistant Minister of Finance Charles Kirui, in order to explain 
why the government had advanced Kenyan shillings 2 billion (about 
dlrs 33 million) to the bank last week. Opposition legislator David 
Mwenje of the Embakasi party was cited in the Standard as saying the 
injection to the national bank ``was tantamount to printing paper 
money'' and was an abuse of public funds. In the list released Friday 
by the Central Bank of Kenya, dozens of companies and individuals 
were named as debtors to 12 different banks, owing more than Kenyan 
Shillings 13.2 billion (about dlrs 2.2 million) in total.
