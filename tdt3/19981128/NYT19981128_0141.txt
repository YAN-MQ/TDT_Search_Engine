Last month, Randi Hutton spent nearly $3,000 replacing something at 
her Redding, Conn., home that wasn't broken. Ms. Hutton, a real estate 
sales agent in Redding, was keenly aware of the risks associated with 
the underground oil storage tank buried under her property. So following 
the advice she typically gives to clients, Ms. Hutton purchased tank 
insurance to protect her in the event the tank leaks. ``The liability 
for a leak can be tremendous,'' Ms. Hutton said, explaining that it 
can cost thousands of dollars to eliminate the contamination caused 
by a leaking fuel tank. ``That's why we've always had tank insurance.'' 
In September, however, Ms. Hutton was advised that before her insurance 
could be renewed, a test of the soil around the tank would have to 
be conducted to determine whether the tank was leaking. ``We figured 
that if we had to have the test done anyway, we might as well spend 
the extra money and get the tank out of the ground,'' she said, adding 
that while the tank was found to be in good condition, she does not 
regret the decision to remove it. ``It's one less thing to worry about.'' 
In fact, Ms. Hutton's decision to remove the tank _ and replace it 
with an above-ground one _ was made easier because by acting quickly, 
while her existing coverage was in effect, she would have been covered 
if the tank was found to be leaking. Homeowners who do not have insurance 
on their underground tanks, however, face a far more uncertain future. 
``Sooner or later, that tank is going to fail,'' said William Selsberg, 
a Stamford. Conn., real estate lawyer. ``And if you don't think that's 
going to be a problem while you own your home, you can be sure it's 
going to be a problem when you sell.'' Selsberg explained that homeowners 
with underground tanks that are not insured and have not yet been 
tested have some difficult decisions to make. If they attempt to obtain 
insurance _ which can cost from $40 to $125 a year, depending on the 
age of the tank, for $100,000 in coverage, with a $500 deductible 
_ and the insurance carrier requires a test, as many now do, and the 
test discloses leakage, the homeowner ends up with two pieces of very 
bad news. First, Selsberg said, the insurance company will decline 
coverage. And second, he said, the testing company should report the 
leak to state environmental officials as required by law. And when 
that happens, he said, the homeowner has no alternative but to remove 
the tank and eliminate any contamination _ without help from the insurance 
company. ``That can be a scary proposition,'' he said. ``If the leak 
has gotten into the ground water or a neighbor's well, you could be 
talking about tens of thousands of dollars.'' On the other hand, Selsberg 
said, it is always possible to avoid discovering a leaking tank by 
simply not testing it. ``Some of my clients take the position that 
if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' he said. ``But I find that unacceptable 
because they don't know it ain't broke unless they test it first.'' 
Moreover, he said, there is no longer any question but that when the 
time comes to sell the house, the buyer will almost certainly insist 
on a test, and may even demand that the tank be removed even if it 
isn't leaking. The reason, Selsberg said, is that no test can guarantee 
that a tank that is not leaking today won't start leaking tomorrow. 
In addition, he said, there are increasing uncertainties about the 
future availability of tank insurance. ``My feeling is that if you 
have an underground fuel storage tank on your property you basically 
have one good option,'' Selsberg said. ``Get it out as soon as possible.'' 
While removing an underground tank is clearly the best way to avoid 
future problems, it is also possible in many places for an underground 
tank that is no longer being used to be abandoned in place, provided 
that proper precautions are taken during the abandonment process. 
Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, for example, all allow for abandonment 
in place, provided that the abandonment is permitted by local authorities 
and is conducted according to the procedures for abandonment set by 
the municipality. Bob VanFossen, assistant director of site remediation 
for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said that 
in New Jersey, municipalities that permit abandonment generally have 
fairly standard procedures that must be followed if a tank is to be 
abandoned properly. For example, he said, many towns require the soil 
around the tank to be tested for contamination before the abandonment 
process can proceed. ``It is mandatory to report to our department 
any discharge of a contaminate,'' VanFossen said, adding that if contamination 
is found, the tank cannot be abandoned in place but must be removed. 
In such a case, he said, all contaminated soil must be removed and 
replaced with clean fill. If the test does not reveal any evidence 
of contamination, however, VanFossen said, the abandonment can proceed. 
Generally, he said, the first step is to pump any remaining liquid 
out of the tank. Then, he said, most laws require that the top of 
the tank be cut off so that a worker can get inside to clean any residue 
and make a visual inspection for leaks. If leaks are found, VanFossen 
said, the entire tank must be removed, the surrounding soil must be 
tested for contamination, and all contaminated soil must be removed 
and replaced. If no leaks are discovered, he said, the tank can usually 
be filled with sand and then covered over with soil. Finally, he said, 
all vents and supply lines must be securely capped. In many cases, 
tank removal experts say, it can actually be less expensive to remove 
an underground tank than to abandon one in place. ``Either way _ whether 
it's a removal or abandonment _ it's going to cost you about $1,300,'' 
said Skip Kost, president of Enviroshield, a tank testing and removal 
company in Stratford, Conn. In fact, Kost said, homeowners who are 
hesitant to have their tanks tested _ and even more hesitant to have 
them removed or abandoned _ might be basing their fears on contamination 
cleanup stories that represent the exception rather than the rule. 
``You always hear the worst-case scenario,'' Kost said. ``Everybody 
has heard about the jobs that cost $10,000 or $50,000 or $100,000, 
but the truth is, most tanks aren't leaking and most clean-up jobs 
end up costing a couple to a few thousand dollars.'' In cases where 
no contamination is present, Kost said, an existing steel tank can 
be removed and replaced with a new 500-gallon fiberglass or corrosion-resistant 
steel tank that carries a 30-year warranty for about $2,500 to $3,000, 
including the cost of removing the old tank. Mark Annis, president 
of ANCO Environmental Services, a Berkeley Heights, N.J., tank-testing 
company, said that his company sells a 275-gallon, double-walled above-ground 
tank that can be installed in a basement for about $1,200, not including 
the cost of removal or abandonment. Annis added that while many homeowners 
may be hesitant to test their tanks out of fear of learning something 
they would rather not know, the one thing that will almost certainly 
increase the cost of an oil-leak contamination clean-up is the passage 
of time. ``Out of sight is out of mind,'' Annis said. ``But when you 
wait until the 11th hour to deal with something like this, you could 
be turning a minor problem into a major one.''
