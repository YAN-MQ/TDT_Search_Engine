William Keating, a London-based art dealer who was born in the United 
States and who helped the Australian financier Alan Bond put together 
a collection of Australian artworks, died on Nov. 4 at his home in 
London. He was 55. The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Angela 
Nevill-Keating. It was Keating who placed Bond's successful $53.9 
million telephone bid for van Gogh's ``Irises'' at Sotheby's in 1987. 
Keating was also known for rediscovering the work of Paul Helleu, 
the Belle Epoque artist. Keating was born in Savannah, Ga., and attended 
Benedictine College in Savannah and the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill. After college he moved to London. In the late 1960s, 
he met Angela Nevill while he was in Amsterdam one weekend attending 
a Rembrandt exhibition. The couple eventually went into partnership, 
forming Nevill Keating, private art dealers. They were married in 
1993. He is survived by his wife.
