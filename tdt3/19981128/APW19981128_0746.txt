Venezuela's largest political party dumped its presidential candidate 
and will back an independent, Yale-educated businessman in a last-ditch 
effort to stop a former coup leader from winning the Dec. 6 race. 
Leaders of the center-left Democratic Action said Saturday the party 
will support former state governor Henrique Salas Romer, who is in 
second place in polls behind former paratrooper Hugo Chavez. After 
a raucous debate at a meeting Friday night, party delegates dropped 
long-time party leader Luis Alfaro Ucero as their candidate. Alfaro, 
77, is a distant third in the polls. Alfaro refused to quit the race 
and may remain on the ballot as the party's official candidate. However, 
his campaign manager quit, the party withdrew financial support and 
TV ads for him, and party leaders said their powerful political machine 
would be behind Salas on election day. Salas, 62, an independent, 
has said he would accept the party's support but that he would not 
give any guarantees to bring the party into power if he wins. Many 
Venezuelans blame the country's traditional parties for squandering 
the world's largest oil reserves outside the Middle East. Chavez, 
44, is drawing support from the poor who see him as a hero partly 
because of his tough anti-corruption talk. The middle and upper-class 
fear he will impose a leftist dictatorship and are largely backing 
Salas. Democratic Action officials said the threat to democracy posed 
by Chavez, who tried to overthrow the government in 1992, forced them 
to back Salas. The party ``has responsibly put aside partisan attitudes 
since ... Venezuela is first,'' said party Secretary-General Lewis 
Perez, a long-time Alfaro supporter. The party's backing was expected 
by many analysts to boost Salas's chances of victory, although Chavez 
said he believed he would get many of the party's votes. Venezuela's 
other major traditional party, the social Christian COPEI, also has 
been wracked by turmoil, with many members clamoring for the party 
to drop its candidate, former Miss Universe Irene Saez, and support 
Salas. Saez, an independent who accepted COPEI's support, says she 
is staying in the race, though the party is expected to make a final 
decision this week.
