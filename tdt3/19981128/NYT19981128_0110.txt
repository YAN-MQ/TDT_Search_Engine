In a box in the stands at the small, handsome Springdale Race Course 
in Camden, S.C., last Sunday afternoon, a sweet, sunny day, Beasie 
Patterson, was watching her daughter, Bitsy, ride Raptor in an early 
steeplechase race, a prelude to the big race later in the day. Bitsy 
would ride Flat Top, a candidate for the Eclipse Award as steeplechasing's 
horse of the year, in the $100,000 Marion duPont Scott Colonial Cup. 
``It was a perfect day for racing,'' recalled Beasie. There was a 
crowd of about 12,000, including the tailgaters picnicking in the 
infield. Beasie, in her black pants suit, was enjoying the race, though 
always with a sense of danger lurking in the back of her mind. She 
had been in the sport long enough, she had said, to know that something 
terrible could happen. Her husband, Duncan, had ridden for 20 years 
and sustained an assortment of relatively minor injuries, and then 
Bitsy had taken up the sport in 1992, when Duncan hung up his competitive 
reins. Bitsy had sustained two concussions. ``And broken her nose 
_ oh, dozens of times,'' Beasie said. As for that fear of serious 
injury, well, said Beasie, ``You try not to think about it.'' Bitsy, 
who had turned 28 a week earlier, and at 5 feet 6 inches and 120 pounds 
with strong hands and smiling blue eyes that hid an intensely competitive 
spirit, had now emerged as one of the leading riders in the sport, 
having won the Grade II Ferguson Memorial at Colonial Downs and the 
Grade I Breeders' Cup Grand National at Far Hills, N.J., in October. 
Listed as an amateur rider, she has nonetheless tallied $167,980 in 
prize money this year. Beasie watched Bitsy, a blonde pony tail escaping 
from her fiberglass helmet, her torso bent forward in the Kelly green 
riding silks, lead Raptor over the next-to-last fence. Suddenly the 
horse's front hooves caught on the hedge, and Raptor and Bitsy toppled 
over. Beasie tensed in the stands. ``I couldn't see her or the horse 
because the hedge covered my view,'' she said. ``I waited for her 
to get up. And then I saw three men running toward them and I heard 
a siren and saw an ambulance speeding toward my daughter. I said, 
`Oh, God, she's not getting up!' And I started running.'' The men 
from the trauma unit were working on Bitsy as her mother arrived. 
Within minutes, Bitsy was in the ambulance and taken to a nearby helicopter, 
which took Bitsy to the Richland Memorial Hospital in Columbia, S.C. 
Her mother, not allowed to accompany her daughter in the small helicopter 
_ Bitsy was having trouble breathing and the paramedics needed the 
small space _ was driven to the hospital, some 30 minutes away by 
car, 16 minutes by helicopter. Raptor had broken a leg and was destroyed. 
When Mrs. Patterson arrived in the emergency ward, she was told, ``It's 
very serious.'' An important sign, the dilation of Bitsy's eyes, was 
not equal. But in the matter of a head injury, the first 48 hours 
are most important. Bitsy had remained unconscious since the fall. 
She was now put on a respirator. There was no skull fracture, but 
there had been bleeding inside the head. Her life, if not her well-being, 
were at stake. Her condition, the hospital reported, was critical. 
``No surgery is required,'' Dr. William Rambo, head of the neurological 
division of the hospital, told Beasie. ``All we can do is watch her 
and hope for the best.'' Beasie _ her given name, Beatrice, is the 
same as her daughter's _ phoned her husband in Miami, where he had 
gone on to watch their other daughter, Jennifer, 18, play in a national 
field hockey tournament. Duncan Patterson, with his brother, Chris, 
runs a family real-estate business in their hometown of Wilmington, 
Del. Quickly, the rest of the family flew to Bitsy's bedside, and 
the Pattersons have spent all week in the family room outside the 
intensive care unit. On Thanksgiving Day, Beasie said, one of the 
things they were thankful for was Bitsy's helmet. ``If Bitsy hadn't 
been wearing it,'' she said, ``the injury would have been even worse.'' 
Rambo said Bitsy's injury was nothing like that of Christopher Reeve's, 
the actor who fractured his spinal column after a spill in a show-jumping 
accident and is a quadriplegic. ``That's a whole different ball game,'' 
he said. Horse-riding injuries are hardly uncommon and occur in a 
wide range of riding sports, from flat racing to casual weekend trotters. 
Steeplechasing is a sport generally related to the well-heeled, and 
the Pattersons are apparently of that world. ``Bitsy loves the sport, 
loves animals, and has had experience in riding from an early age,'' 
said her mother. ``From pony races when she was smaller, to fox hunting.'' 
On Tuesday, she was taken off the respirator, but when she had trouble 
breathing, was put back on it. On Wednesday, for the first time, Bitsy's 
eyes began to dilate symmetrically. And she seems to be coming slowly 
to semiconsciousness. ``She followed some commands to move her hand 
and her feet,'' Rambo said. ``I call her state a light coma.'' A case 
of pneumonia, he said, had ``complicated matters.'' But her condition 
has been upgraded from critical to serious. ``It's too early to tell 
for sure how she's going to come out of this,'' Rambo said. ``At this 
point, though, we're cautiously optimistic.'' Sunday, the respirator 
had been removed from her throat and Patterson, though still unconscious, 
responded to a nurse asking her, ``Are you feeling better?'' Beasie, 
who was at her daughter's bedside, said Bitsy nodded her head yes. 
``She's still in a fog,'' Beasie recalled, ``but she responded. It 
was very exciting. Very exciting.''
