supporters of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet are asking 
the british government to let him return home. pinochet is sought 
by spanish authorities on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism 
during his 17-year rule. he was arrested at a london hospital last 
month and awaits possible extradition to spain. chile's foreign minister 
says it is unlikely pinochet would be treated fairly in a spanish 
court. from our point of view, we believe that the case against general 
pinochet has violated our rights in terms of immunity, of the jurisdiction 
of our courts and of the laws to be applied. and that's what we're 
complaining about. to make the case more simpler, we agree that no 
former head of government should have immunity from prosecution for 
his crimes. the question is, who has the jurisdiction to prosecute 
him and under what laws is he going to be prosecuted? that's what 
we're complaining about. britain's home secretary will decide december 
11th whether to allow extradition proceedings to begin.
