Good evening. We begin in Seattle, Washington tonight where the toll 
stands at three dead and 32 injured in the crash of a city bus after 
a passenger shot the driver. He was alone, unemployed and a figure 
at a homeless Shelter. The latest from Jim foreman in Seattle. This 
is all that remains of the bus. The driver lost control after being 
shot by a passenger. The vehicle smashed into an apartment building, 
taking a chunk out of the roof. Police say the gunman then turned 
the gun of himself, committing suicide. As crews work on the bus, 
homicide detectives were on the job, too, trying to unravel the mystery. 
The bus, carrying more than 30 passengers was heading for downtown 
Seattle. People helped paramedics tend to the injured. A lot of people 
were screaming and moaning and groaning. And just -- just chaos. I 
remember seeing glass flying all over the place. I was still in the 
seat and when the bus landed, I got out of the door. They were lying 
all over the place, and I said, my God. I just feel happy that I escaped 
all this. No one on the ground was hurt, though a dozen people were 
in the bus's path. There was concrete flying ER where. And I thought 
I was going to die. Police found two guns. But what they have not 
found is a motive for the shooting. We don't know at this point why 
he fired at the bus driver or who started that process. We're still 
looking for those answers. Police plan to reinterview the passengers. 
The shooter's father says he has no idea what could have led his son 
to do something like this.
