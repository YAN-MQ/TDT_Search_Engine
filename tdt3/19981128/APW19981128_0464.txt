More than 15,000 Turks demonstrated in several German cities Saturday 
urging Italy to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader to face trial in 
Turkey on charges of murder and terrorism. Protest marches in Berlin, 
Bonn, Munich and Nuremberg came one day after Germany and Italy agreed 
to push for establishing an international court to hear charges against 
Abdullah Ocalan, whose outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, has 
fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. Ocalan's fate 
has been a subject of debate since police arrested him Nov. 12 in 
Italy on arrival aboard a flight from Moscow. A Rome court freed him 
Nov. 20, rejecting a Turkish warrant because Italian law forbids the 
extradition of suspects to countries where they face the death penalty. 
Ocalan also faces murder and terror charges in Germany, which does 
not have the death penalty, but Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Friday 
ruled out seeking his extradition for fear of Kurdish unrest. About 
one-fifth of Germany's 2 million Turkish residents are Kurds, and 
Germany has seen numerous protests since Ocalan's arrest _ Turks demanding 
his extradition to Turkey and Kurds demanding his freedom. About 11,000 
Kurds protested in Bonn on Friday as Schroeder met with Italian Premier 
Massimo D'Alema. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer met with D'Alema 
in Rome on Saturday, presumably to discuss Ocalan's case. The Kurdish 
leader, who has requested asylum in Italy, is now under police surveillance 
at a Rome villa. Judges ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 
while Germany decided whether to seek extradition. What happens next 
depends on his asylum request and on the establishment of an international 
court. Turkish protests Saturday were peaceful. Police estimated about 
6,500 protesters in Munich; 5,000 in Nuremberg; and 3,500 in both 
Berlin and Bonn.
