French President Jacques Chirac says the warring parties in Congo 
have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The announcement was made at 
the end of a summit of African leaders in paris. The agreement will 
be signed next month. It was brokered by U.N. secretary-general Kofi 
Annan. Rebels and forces loyal to the Congolese president have been 
fighting for four months.
