Several big companies caught merger fever this week, one symptom of 
which was a surge in the Dow. Stan case looks at the week in business. 
From the Internet to banks, to big oil, billion-dollar mergers dominated 
the business news this week. It began when America online announced 
it was buying Netscape for $4.2 billion in stock. AOL is the nation's 
biggest Internet provider, and Netscape provides the software many 
people use to browse the web. The deal includes sun Microsystems, 
and will help that company promote its java programming language. 
Germany's Deutsche bank confirmed it's preparing to buy banker's trust 
for more than $9 billion in cash. It's the biggest take over of a 
U.S. financial company by an overseas bank. Deutsche bank wants a 
foothold in the American stock and bond markets. Exxon and mobile 
announced they're in merger talks, too. The proposed deal would be 
the biggest in history, create the biggest energy company in the world, 
and the biggest company of any kind in the United States. All this 
merger talk pushed Wall Street into record territory. The Dow industrials 
were up nearly 2% for the week. And then there's the merger that wasn't. 
The Yankees broke off talks with cablevision. Cablevision already 
owns the New York Knicks and rangers. But sources say discussions 
broke down over how much control Yankee owner george Steinbrenner 
would keep if the deal went through. That's "business this week," 
Stan case, "CNN Headline News."
