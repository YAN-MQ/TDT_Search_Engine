Police in clermont, Florida, are getting help from 200 volunteers 
in their search for a 6-year-old girl who's been missing since Thanksgiving 
day. The girl was last seen by her father playing outside of their 
apartment building. Yesterday, authorities tried using bloodhounds 
to track the girl, but the dogs lost her scent. Police say they've 
interviewed several people about the girl's disappearance, but they 
have no suspects.
