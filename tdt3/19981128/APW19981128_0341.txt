Granting the Islamic religion government status could help set a national 
standard for introducing Islamic teaching in public schools, Interior 
Minister Otto Schily was quoted as saying in a news magazine report 
Saturday. Schily, according to Focus, supports giving Islam the same 
``official'' status as the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, 
which receive government funds. Their followers pay so-called ``church 
taxes'' and their children can take voluntary religious classes in 
public schools. The new center-left Social Democrat-Greens coalition 
government, elected in September, is eager to develop new policies 
acknowledging the multi-ethnic quality of modern Germany. It has proposed 
relaxing citizenship laws to make it easier for foreign nationals 
to become Germans. Schily's comments followed a controversial ruling 
by a Berlin court last month giving the Islamic Federation, representing 
12 of the city's 70 mosques, the right to organize Islamic religious 
instruction for public school students. Liberal Muslims who find the 
Islamic Federation too radical opposed the ruling. A lawmaker of Turkish 
descent has urged the government to set a standard for Islamic curriculum 
nationwide to avoid giving control to a single group that might support 
fundamentalism. Schily said a government-recognized Islamic movement 
could introduce Islamic teaching in public schools while at the same 
time make sure Muslim children also are learning the German language 
and laws. The Berlin court ruling also was opposed by Germans resistant 
to ``multiculturalism'' who argue it clashes with western, Christian 
traditions. Schily emphasized that Islamic laws and customs should 
never take precedence over German culture, saying that Muslim residents 
should learn German. Germany's largest minority population is its 
2 million Turks. ``It cannot be that a Turkish minority in Berlin 
can demand that street signs ... be written also in Turkish,'' he 
said.
