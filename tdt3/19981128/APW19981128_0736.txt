The most influential person in Sudan's government, parliamentary Speaker 
Hassan Turabi, told fellow lawmakers Saturday that he will resign 
from the speaker's post, a report said. Deputy Speaker Ellison Magaia 
was quoted by the official Egyptian news agency MENA as saying that 
Turabi would resign in order to devote his time to the National Congress, 
which is effectively the ruling party. ``Turabi will continue heading 
the assembly until it approves next year's budget on Dec. 17,'' MENA 
quoted Magaia as saying after a meeting of leading legislators Saturday. 
Turabi is widely regarded as the principal ideologue of the military-backed 
government of President Omar el-Bashir. His departure from the speakership 
was not expected to result in a reduction in his role as the power 
behind the scenes. Earlier in the day, the president's legal adviser, 
Abdel-Basit Sabdarat, announced that his chief would not ``intervene 
in the selection'' of a new speaker, the official Sudanese news agency 
SUNA reported. The government newspaper Al-Anbaa had reported Tuesday 
that Turabi would be retiring as speaker. Al-Anbaa said Turabi would 
announce his resignation before a new law that legalizes ``political 
associations'' takes effect on Jan. 1. Political parties have been 
banned since the military seized power in 1989. Turabi has not responded 
to the reports, but earlier this year he expressed a desire to leave 
Parliament.
