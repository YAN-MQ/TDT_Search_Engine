The Baltimore Orioles, trying to recover from an expensive and disappointing 
season, inched closer Saturday to adding Albert Belle to their depleted 
lineup. Arn Tellem, Belle's agent, said ``it's close,'' but cautioned 
that ``a couple little issues'' had to be resolved. An Orioles official 
said the two sides had already agreed to the basic terms of the contract, 
five years and about $65 million. There was a wild-card element to 
the negotiations, however, and that was Belle himself. A friend of 
the slugging but controversial outfielder reiterated Saturday that 
Belle could still decide that he wanted to return to the Chicago White 
Sox, for whom he played the past two years. But Tellem said he thought 
if the remaining issues were worked out, Belle would accept the deal 
and join the Orioles. Belle, 32, is a free agent until next Wednesday 
because of a clause in the five-year, $55 million contract he signed 
with the White Sox two years ago. That clause stipulates that if he 
was no longer among the three highest-paid players he could be a temporary 
free agent and either sign elsewhere or remain with the White Sox. 
He has spoken with Jerry Reinsdorf, the White Sox owner, about the 
possibility of staying in Chicago, but Reinsdorf apparently has not 
agreed to make any adjustments in the contract, either by adding money 
or by extending the no-trade provision beyond next season. The Yankees 
had pursued Belle in case they did not re-sign Bernie Williams and, 
in fact, seemed at one point closer to adding Belle than keeping Williams. 
But when the Orioles offered Belle $65 million for five years, the 
Yankees decided that if they were going to spend that amount of money 
or more, they might as well match the offer the Boston Red Sox had 
made to Williams. That left the Orioles as the only team still chasing 
Belle, who after midseason this year batted .387, clubbed 31 home 
runs and drove in 86 runs in 76 games. The Orioles want Belle's bat 
in their lineup to turn around the losing season they had this year 
despite their $72 million payroll, a baseball record. People who have 
dealt with Belle believe he would fare better in Baltimore than he 
would have in New York because he would face less stress. In the past, 
at least, fans have been able to incite Belle, and he has paid for 
it, in suspensions and fines. The Orioles' lineup has shrunk during 
the off season, with Roberto Alomar and Eric Davis leaving as free 
agents. The Orioles have made offers to two of their other free agents, 
first baseman Rafael Palmeiro and left fielder B.J. Surhoff, but neither 
player was moving quickly to accept. If the Orioles sign Belle, they 
presumably would stop pursuing Surhoff, leaving the Mets in better 
position to sign him to play left field.
