The federal government is planning to crash test dozens of 1999 model 
cars and trucks. The national highway traffic safety administration 
says the tests will cover 63 vehicles. 32 will be tested for front-impact 
crashes while 31 models will be tested for impact to the driver's 
side. The tests will give consumers front-impact safety information 
on 70% of the 1999 model vehicles sold in the United States and side-impact 
results on 80%. Vehicles will be rated on a scale of one to five stars. 
Test results will be posted on the Internet as they become available, 
at, as you see it there, at www.nhtsa.gov.
