Associated Press Writer LAUSA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A memorial service 
Saturday for a teacher killed by Serb police a year ago and a swearing-in 
ceremony for new recruits to Kosovo Liberation Army marked the anniversary 
of the rebels' first public appearance. Hundreds of KLA members attended 
a memorial service in Lausa, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest 
of Pristina, for Halit Geci, a school teacher killed last November 
by Serb security forces as he sat in his classroom. Three uniformed 
members of the KLA appeared at his funeral on Nov. 28 last year _ 
the first time they had appeared in public. ``That night we decided 
to fight until the last Serb leaves and until we are independent,'' 
said Shaban Muslem, a KLA commander, during his speech at the ceremony. 
``Our only weapons were our morale and our will,'' he added, while 
a crowd of several hundred people chanted the name of the rebel army. 
``After some months, the KLA were all around Kosovo,'' Muslem said. 
``The war had started. For the first time, the Serbs saw they would 
have to fight to keep Kosovo.'' Clashes that began in February following 
a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo have claimed 
hundreds of lives and forced more than 300,000 people from their homes. 
Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, a province of Serbia. 
The Serb security forces quickly and soundly put down the KLA rebellion 
this summer, but since the cease-fire in October, the guerrillas have 
been boldly returning to some areas from which they had been driven. 
Children from Geci's school recited poems in his honor and later accompanied 
his daughter, Valbona, 19, and his nephew Driton Geci, as they lay 
a wreath of plastic flowers at his grave on the outskirts of Lausa. 
About 100 KLA fighters stood at attention facing the grave for a minute's 
silence. In the nearby village of Prekaz, around 300 new recruits 
swore their allegiance to the KLA in the shadow of the Albanian flag 
_ a double-headed eagle on a red background. The recruits, most of 
whom were middle-aged, swore to fight ``for the freedom of occupied 
Albanian lands, for unity of the lands.'' ``I will always be a faithful 
soldier, a soldier of freedom, of vigilance, brave and disciplined,'' 
they said in unison. A large crowd of civilians who had gathered to 
watch the ceremony erupted in spontaneous applause at the arrival 
of a column of KLA special forces in black uniforms. The special forces 
were renamed the Adem Jashari unit, after the local KLA leader who 
was killed along with another 27 members of his family by Serb authorities 
last March. Saturday would have been his 43rd birthday, villagers 
said. His daughter, wearing a KLA camouflage uniform, cried as the 
assembled crowd held one minute's silence in memory of her relatives. 
``On behalf of my family and my name, those who were killed and those 
who are alive, I congratulate you on the oath that you gave to the 
KLA on this day of the flag,'' she said, addressing the rebel group's 
new members. ``I am the daughter of brave Kosovo.''
