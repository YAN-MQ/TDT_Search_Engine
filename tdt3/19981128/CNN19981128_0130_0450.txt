The worldwatch institute says bad weather caused $89 billion in damage 
this year. That's more than all the damage from weather-related disasters 
in the 1980s. The institute claims humans are largely responsible 
for that. It says deforestation and climate changes helped cause this 
year's most severe disasters, including hurricane Mitch and the torrential 
flooding in china.
