A member of the Iranian air force left his barracks with a gun, hijacked 
a van and went on a shooting spree that left 14 people dead before 
police shot him to death Saturday, the officials news agency reported. 
Eleven people were wounded in the rampage. At least three of the dead 
were policemen. The Islamic Republic News Agency gave few details 
of the events. But it said that the soldier, identified as Siavosh 
Rahmani-Aqdam, left his barracks Thursday ``with a firearm and a large 
amount of cartridges.'' A manhunt was launched after the man killed 
six people on Thursday. Police eventually shot him Saturday in a suburb 
of south Tehran, the agency said.
