Erik Nitsche, an art director, graphic designer, photographer, illustrator 
and book packager known for his posters, advertisements, logos and 
book designs, died on Nov. 10 in Danbury, Conn. He was 90. Nitsche 
was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1908 and worked in Switzerland, 
Germany and the United States. He was among a handful of progressive 
designers and artists who imbued American graphic design with a Modern 
European sensibility. One of his most important contributions was 
the development of information design systems in books and corporate 
annual reports produced for General Dynamics Co. from 1955 to 1960. 
At General Dynamics, which produced the first nuclear-powered submarine, 
the Nautilus, Nitsche was hired to develop a visual image that would 
introduce this submarine to the world and at the same time emphasize 
the company's peaceful concerns. The design for the submarine was 
top secret, so Nitsche devised a symbolic solution based on the message 
``Atoms for Peace.'' He created a series of posters in English, Russian, 
German, French, Hindi and Japanese featuring abstract and symbolic 
images. Today these are among the classic modern posters. Earlier 
in his career, Nitsche made illustrations for the German weeklies 
Querschnitt and Simplicissimus, designed alphabets for the French 
type foundry Deberny &AMP; Peignot, and illustrated covers for Harper's 
Bazaar, Fortune, Town and Country, Vanity Fair, House and Garden, 
and Look. He produced several hundred record-album covers for Decca 
in the United States and was vice president of Dorland International, 
an advertising agency in Germany. In the 1950s and '60s he was consultant 
to the Museum of Modern Art's department of design and to Standard 
Oil of New Jersey. He also designed advertising campaigns for Saks 
Fifth Avenue and Ohrbach's department stores and posters for Universal 
Pictures and 20th Century Fox. Nitsche was an innovative book designer 
and packager. He was visual editor of the General Dynamics company 
history, a huge book titled ``Dynamic America.'' Other major projects 
were a 12-volume history of science and technology that sold more 
than 2 million copies in many languages, and a five-volume history 
of the 20th century, produced by his company, Erik Nitsche International. 
His book design had a simple beauty and didactic economy, with dynamic 
silhouettes and vignettes. His typography was clean and crisp, a marriage 
of classical and modern approaches. In 1980 Nitsche temporarily turned 
to painting, but a year later he moved to Munich and returned to the 
field, designing exhibition catalogs, posters and stamps. He is survived 
by his wife, Renate; two sons, John, of Philadelphia and Marc, of 
Geneva, and five grandchildren.
