To Ukraine now and concerns that history could repeat itself. Scientists 
this week gathered to discuss safety at the nuclear power plant that's 
synonymous with nuclear disaster -- Chernobyl. Here's NBC's Dana Lewis. 
Delegates to an international conference of scientists took the chernobyl 
tour to better assess the danger level in this ticking time bomb. 
No one has been able to permanently short circuit the hastily abandoned 
control panels and sealed doors. 12 years after number 4 reactor was 
sealed in a concrete and metal sarcophagus, there are leaks. Experts 
say deep inside the concrete tomb in the destroyed generating unit 
of the nuclear plant about 200 tons of fuel remain. Decomposition 
is producing radioactive dust, which they say could set off a Chemical 
chain reaction causing the spread of radioactive particles. Well, 
due to the deteriorating condition of the Shelter, there is an urgency 
to get on with stabilizing it for the long term. Already over $300 
million has been paid out by G-7 countries, including the U.S., to 
seal off Chernobyl. But that's only half the funding needed to secure 
the site. Radioactivity still dangerously high, and water tricklinging 
through the plant may have already damaged the water table. The towns 
closest to the plant have been abandoned. At least 4,300 people have 
died since the accident in 1986. Fire crews still practice for the 
frightening possibility number four reactor could eat its way through 
the concrete and steel. A radioactive threat still looms, and the 
nuclear facility's number three reactor is still online, despite western 
pressure to shut it down by the year 2000. Cash-strapped Ukraine is 
appealing for more money to keep the world safely shielded from Chernobyl.
