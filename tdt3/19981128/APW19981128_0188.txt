A Turkish military helicopter crashed near this southeastern city 
on Saturday killing 17 soldiers, the Anatolia news agency said. The 
type of the helicopter and the cause of the crash was not immediately 
clear. The agency said the chopper was on a mission at the time of 
the crash near the town of Cukurca, on the Iraqi border. Turkish troops 
have been fighting autonomy seeking Kurdish guerrillas in the region. 
The rebels have downed Turkish military helicopters in the past. Military 
officials were not available for comment. The conflict has claimed 
nearly 37,000 lives since 1984.
