Acting on new information from Polish investigators, German prosecutors 
will soon bring charges against two former Nazi officials, a news 
magazine reported Saturday. A former Gestapo official in Katowice, 
Poland, will be charged in connection with sentencing 1,000 Nazi prisoners 
to death by hanging, according to Der Spiegel. Another former Nazi 
officer will be charged with shooting to death seven prisoners in 
the Therisienstadt concentration camp during the last days of the 
war. Both men will be charged in Stuttgart, the report said. Stuttgart 
prosecutors earlier this week charged a 79-year-old former Gestapo 
agent in connection with the deaths of 17,000 people, mostly Jews 
at the Majdanek concentration camp. The suspect, identified as Alfons 
Goetzfrid, remains under investigation in connection with 45,000 other 
killings near Lemberg, in present-day Ukraine, and near Lublin, Poland. 
Charges against Goetzfrid, as well as the expected charges against 
the two others, stem from Polish investigators who have filed 10 new 
cases with German authorities in the past six months, Die Spiegel 
reported. The Hamburg-based magazine said about 100 cases remain under 
investigation in Poland.
