Stuart Sutherland, a British psychologist who analyzed his own brush 
with mental illness in the most remarkable of his insightful books, 
died on Nov. 8 in his home in Brighton, England. He was 71. The cause 
was a heart attack, said the University of Sussex, where he was professor 
emeritus of experimental psychology. A severe case of manic depression 
struck Sutherland at the height of his career. His candid account 
of this experience, ``Breakdown: A Personal Crisis and a Medical Dilemma,'' 
became a best seller. It was first published in Britain in 1976, and 
it was revised and reissued this year by Oxford University Press. 
The new version added chapters on the latest therapies, including 
drugs that are now used to treat the disorder. His other books that 
are in print in this country are, ``Irrationality: Why We Can't Think 
Straight!'' (Rutgers, 1994) and ``The International Dictionary of 
Psychology'' (Crossroad, 1995). Norman Stuart Sutherland was born 
in Birmingham and educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he began 
his academic career after receiving a doctorate in 1953 with a joint 
degree in psychology, philosophy and physiology. A major focus of 
his research was how animals, including humans, recognize shapes. 
To pursue the subject, he made annual pilgrimages to Naples in the 
1950s and 1960s to work at the Zoological Station there. He and several 
fellow experimenters investigated such things as the physical basis 
of memory, experimenting with the common octopus because it is one 
of the animal kingdom's fast learners. Sutherland lectured on experimental 
psychology at Oxford in the early 1960s and in 1965 joined the faculty 
of the newly established University of Sussex in Brighton. He made 
his mark when he set up and directed its experimental psychology laboratory 
and made it a magnet for aspiring specialists in that field. His mental 
breakdown in the early 1970s cut short his research, but he never 
stopped writing on his specialty as well as the wide range of subjects 
that piqued his interest. His ``Breakdown'' inspired the play ``Melon,'' 
by Simon Gray, which had a successful run in London's West End, starring 
Alan Bates. Sutherland is survived by his wife of 32 years, Jose Louis 
Fogden; two daughters, Gay and Julia Sutherland, and one granddaughter.
