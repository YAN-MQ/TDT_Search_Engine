The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday to a cease-fire 
to end the fighting between rebels and forces loyal to Congolese President 
Laurent Kabila, French President Jacques Chirac said. Chirac told 
a news conference on the final day of a summit of African leaders 
in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo ``had reached a consensus to 
stop this war.'' Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a 
cease-fire agreement was to be signed sometime in December before 
a meeting of the Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, 
Chirac said. ``The Secretary General has achieved an agreement for 
the reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and 
painful war,'' Chirac said. Earlier, Annan presided at a two-hour 
meeting of officials, including Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and 
Rwanda, who are supporting rebels waging an insurgency in Congo. The 
heads of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part. Chirac said the 
meeting had been ``held in a tense but not hostile environment.'' 
He did not refer to whether the rebels in Congo had been consulted, 
or what their position now would be. He said Kabila had agreed to 
democratic reforms and the need to establish dialogue. ``Every party 
has made progress toward a greater rapprochement,'' he said. Kabila 
came to power in May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian dictator 
Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and democracy in his renamed 
Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics say his regime's 18 
months in power have seen repressive policies and a growing intolerance 
of criticism. Disaffected members of his armed forces banded together 
with ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier this year and launched a rebellion, 
accusing the president of corruption, nepotism and tribalism. The 
purpose of the Paris talks on the sidelines of an African summit on 
security was to try to work out some framework for peace negotiations 
between the warring parties. Annan on Friday had urged African leaders 
_ especially those at war in Congo _ to renounce violence and accept 
compromise to achieve peace. Annan said many African conflicts are 
``rooted in a culture of intolerance'' and that the Congo conflict 
poses the continent's greatest challenge. Chirac on Friday urged African 
nations to do their own peacekeeping _ a departure from past practices 
that put the burden on France and other Western nations. Chirac also 
renewed France's call for a regional peace conference in central Africa's 
Great Lakes region. Thirty four African leaders attended the 20th 
French-African summit which addressed the issue of how to tame wars 
raging across the continent. All eyes were on Kabila, who finally 
sat down with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, 
Rwanda's leader. Kabila's presence in France has been the focus of 
attention following the decision by Britain's House of Lords to reject 
immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. French Prosecutors, 
responding to complaints by human rights groups, ruled Friday that 
Kabila could not be pursued for human rights violations because he 
benefits from customary immunity accorded heads of state in office. 
At a state dinner Friday night, Kabila was the only African leader 
Chirac did not publicly greet on the steps of the Elysee Palace. Instead, 
Chirac welcomed the Congolese leader inside, far from the cameras.
