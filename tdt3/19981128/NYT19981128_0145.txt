Several years ago, John Acierno woke up in his four-bedroom Colonial 
in the prosperous Long Island village of Manhasset with the kind of 
primal scream heard in a growing number of suburban homes these days: 
``What am I doing out here?'' His children had moved out, leaving 
him and his wife, Roberta, with three bedrooms where no one was sleeping. 
Everything about the suburbs that made sense when the children were 
around _ the worry-free schools, the back yard for touch football 
with the cousins, the easy hop to Dunkin' Donuts _ no longer made 
sense. ``It wasn't for me,'' was his verdict. Like other suburban 
misfits, he pined for New York, where he had his business, a car-dispatching 
service, his museums _ oil painting is his hobby _ and, well, the 
big city itself. ``You get up at 2 in the morning and there's life,'' 
he said. ``In the suburbs, at 9 o'clock they roll the streets up.'' 
So with the city cooperating by reinventing itself in a safer, tidier 
form, the Aciernos sold their house and are counting the days until 
they pass muster at a Fifth Avenue co-op. For halfhearted suburbanites 
like Acierno, 62, the suburbs have always been a time as well as a 
place _ a defined period of life that, like a hard winter, comes to 
an end. That's why it was not surprising to read recently that, with 
the city rejuvenated, real-estate brokers were reporting a doubling 
in the number of returnees, mostly empty-nesters coming back while 
still young enough to savor the electricity. ``No one, including brokers, 
thought of New York as a place to relax and enjoy life,'' says Barbara 
Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group. ``They thought of it as 
a place to work and survive.'' Actually, what is happening is not 
really new. New York's suburbs have always been inhabited by two discrete 
species. There are those who grew up there, took an urban detour to 
land a spouse or a career, but had their sights set on settling in 
suburbia. Then there are those who moved to the suburbs with reluctant 
hearts, more for the children than for themselves. The two groups 
overlap in feeling the suburbs are unmatched for providing an untroubled 
world of decorous houses and pleasant neighbors who may have problems 
but, unlike the homeless, fortunately keep them invisible. Many initially 
grudging suburbanites never leave, because they grow accustomed to 
unruffled days, the vivid parade of the seasons, the civility. Others 
leap back, finding themselves starving for hurly-burly street theater 
and the cosmopolitan flavors of humanity. The hungry group includes 
Jaki and Richard Soreff, who in the late 1960s ambivalently arrived 
in Freeport on Long Island's south shore to raise Jeffrey and Jordan. 
Mrs. Soreff, 60, a Hadassah member, is an endearing eccentric, a graduate 
of the High School of Music and Art, who when she's in the city ambles 
down to Battery Park to chat about snakes with the python man or takes 
her Middle Eastern drum to a spot near Central Park's band shell to 
jam with the resident young drummers. ``How can I do this in the suburbs?'' 
she said. ``You don't find these people here. They just don't exist.'' 
Although somewhat more partial to the suburbs, Richard Soreff, an 
accountant, has deep city roots stretching back to Public School 99 
in Midwood, Brooklyn, where Woody Allen was a classmate. (The comedian 
showed his promise when he wrote in Soreff's eighth-grade autograph 
book: ``Roses are red/ Violets are blue/ Alan Ladd is handsome/ So 
what!'') ``I think in almost every way the suburbs are an also-ran,'' 
Mrs. Soreff said. ``It's almost the country, but not quite. It's almost 
the city, but not quite. It has a little bit of what both areas have 
to offer, but not either.'' The Soreffs moved to New York City once 
before, staying for 12 years until a lucrative offer enticed them 
to sell their East 68th Street apartment. When they returned to Freeport 
in March, Mrs. Soreff hated it all over again. She is searching for 
another Manhattan apartment and insists she will not even miss her 
suburban greenery. ``We have Central Park,'' she said, as if she were 
already back. ``And I don't have to do the weeding.''
