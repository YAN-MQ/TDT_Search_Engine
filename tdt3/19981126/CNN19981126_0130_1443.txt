This is no ordinary cartoon. It's the next wave in movie animation. 
Dennis Michael reports. This week, "A bug's life" enters the holiday 
box office. An indicator of the fastest changing segment of the movie 
business. Let's ride! The progress in terms of what we do in normal 
live-action pictures is pretty much the same as when "citizen kane" 
was made. In the computer animation world, it's probably 20 times 
more complicated and more intense than "toy story." And the world 
is up to its antennae in sophisticated animation this fall. "Antz" 
is currently number one in Australia, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. 
Germany and Sweden have made Disney's "mulan" number one. And in the 
United States, "the rugrats movie," sophisticated in its own iconoclastic 
way, is a box office champ. Hang on to your diapies, babies, we're 
going in. This is just like a golden age for animation. And I mean, 
I think it's so wide open now as to what the audience will accept. 
I mean, look at "south park," you know, "the simpsons," "king of the 
hill." Candy-colored, roly-poly princesses are a thing of the past 
for movie animation. The art form has grown up. Or at least that's 
the hope of the dreamworks animation studio, which is taking a big 
Gamble on its Biblical animated epic "prince of Egypt." We wanted 
to do something different. We want to be able to explore every kind 
of story. We want to be able to do science fiction, action-adventure, 
rocky romantic comedy. We want to be able to give more sophisticated 
themes an opportunity to be dramatized again using this technique 
which has so much creative possibility to it. In animation, if you 
can dream it, if you can imagine it, it's actually possible to do 
it. The art of the impossible will continue to grow as the millennium 
approaches. Industry leader Disney is finishing a stylish new "Tarzan" 
for release this summer and a new "fantasia 2000" will bid to keep 
the crown for the king of animation firmly on the head of the mouse. 
But heavy competition in the animation business is resulting in a 
headlong toon transformation. For the colony and for oppressed bugs 
everywhere! Dennis Michael, "CNN Entertainment News," Hollywood.
