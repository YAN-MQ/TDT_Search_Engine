Jewish settlers on Thursday blocked Palestinian school children enroute 
to a field trip, touching off scuffling between Palestinians and Israelis, 
according to witnesses. Israeli police said they detained four Palestinians, 
including the school principal and a student, for questioning. A dozen 
girls were taken to the hospital, but no injuries were reported. The 
confrontation began at 8 a.m. when pupils aged 6 to 14 from the Kurtouba 
Preparatory School gathered to board a bus to go to Jerusalem. Palestinian 
witnesses said about 20 settlers from the nearby Beit Haddasah enclave 
confronted the girls and began pushing them back into the school, 
which is located in the Israeli-controlled part of the city. ``We 
were planning to go on a trip, and two female settlers blocked us 
and started shouting and cursing. More settlers came, and then the 
police came and pushed us back to school. We were so scared,'' said 
10-year-old Ula Natshe. Palestinian residents say that in recent weeks 
Israeli troops and settlers have harassed Palestinians who walked 
by the Jewish settler enclave. Ofir Sivan, spokesman for Israeli police 
in the West Bank district, said the scuffle broke out after some 40 
students led by their principal, Firial Abu Hekal, refused orders 
to end a protest. Sivan said the Palestinians were protesting what 
they believed to be continued harassment of the school girls by the 
settlers. Five pupils were carried away in Palestinian ambulances 
after fainting, and the hospital later reported 12 were seen by doctors. 
Palestinian officials said Israeli police detained a 13 year-old student 
and school Superintendent Taysir Maswadah in addition to the principal. 
Two parents were also detained after attempting to get into the school 
to get their children.
