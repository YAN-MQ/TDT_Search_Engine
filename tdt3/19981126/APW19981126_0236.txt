Romania's government and its main church plan to build a huge, multimillion-dollar 
cathedral in central Bucharest despite criticism of the large public 
expense involved. ``Romania needs such a church and I think Romanians 
deserve it,'' Prime Minister Radu Vasile said late Wednesday in announcing 
the Romanian Orthodox Church project, called ``The Salvation of the 
People.'' Almost 90 percent of Romanians are Christian Orthodox. But 
some criticized the planned new church as an expensive public relations 
exercise in a country with an average monthly wage of 1.2 million 
lei (dlrs 120). ``There are villages without churches and hundreds 
of historical monuments in ruins,'' said journalist Valentin Neagu. 
``To construct such a megalomaniac building means the government wants 
to leave a reminder of its transitory rule.'' The cathedral will cost 
at least 50 billion lei (dlrs 5 million). Funding will come from the 
government and private sponsors. It will hold 2,000 worshipers with 
space for another 20,000 on a platform outside, said Patriarch Teoctist, 
head of the church. Government officials said the building will have 
a surface of two hectares (almost five acres), reach a height of 50 
meters (165 feet) and have an underground three-level car park. It 
will connect to the capital's subway and a shopping mall. The cathedral 
is planned for the same district as a giant palace built by former 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu which was called the ``House of the People.'' 
Ceausescu, an atheist, knocked down churches to make way for apartment 
buildings.
