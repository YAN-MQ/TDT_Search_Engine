Comedian Milton berle says flip Wilson was one of the funniest people 
he ever knew. Wilson died last night of liver cancer at his Malibu, 
California, home. He was 64. The actor and comedian became the first 
successful African-American host of a TV variety program with "the 
flip Wilson show" during the early 1970s. Wilson's fans say his G-rated 
brand of humor helped make him a success. There was a gentleness -- 
a gentle quality to his work. He could occasionally give a squeal 
and a little cute flip. It's interesting I used the word cute, because 
comedy itself is only rarely cute. Especially these days, it's often 
very harsh and aggressive, and mean-spirited. But flip Wilson never 
worked that way. There was always a gentleness, a sweetness, a cuteness 
to his work. I wish, we had more like him today. A memorial service 
for flip Wilson is being planned.
