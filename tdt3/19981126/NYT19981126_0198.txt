From her jewelry shop on a busy street here, Iman Khalidi is watching 
the confrontation between Iraq and the United States with growing 
frustration. Like many people in Jordan and across the Arab world, 
she has nothing good to say about Saddam Hussein. But she is angry 
that Western countries threaten to punish him for defying United Nations 
resolutions while, she said, ``they just stand by as Israel does the 
very same thing.'' ``Absolutely there is a double standard, and it 
makes us very angry,'' Ms. Kahlidi said from behind a counter filled 
with silver bracelets and earrings. ``When the U.N. demands that Israel 
withdraw from occupied territories and Israel refuses, the world does 
nothing. But with Saddam, he must do what the U.N. says or he is bombed. 
It is so very unfair.'' The recent signing of a new accord between 
Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and the resulting turnover of some 
occupied land to Palestinian control, appears to have had little effect 
on the widespread perception here that Israel enjoys a form of international 
impunity. ``If you tell the Arab man on the street that Saddam is 
a murderer, he will agree,'' said a longtime adviser to King Hussein 
of Jordan who asked not to be identified. ``But he will also ask you 
when the United States ever forced Israel to accept a Security Council 
resolution. This is what our people think. There is a sense of injustice.'' 
Israeli leaders concede that they have not fully carried out Security 
Council resolutions demanding that they hand more occupied land back 
to Arabs and refrain from building settlements on such land. But they 
say they cannot do so for security reasons. They say they their recent 
handovers show their good faith, and that they will hand back more 
land when and if their Palestinian counterparts show a greater ability 
to control terrorism. Officials in many Arab countries desperately 
hope that Saddam will cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors to head 
off a U.S.-led attack. Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia are among nations 
that have publicly urged him to do whatever is necessary to satisfy 
the inspectors. But while Western powers see inspections as a way 
to weaken Iraq, some Arab leaders hope compliance will ultimately 
free Iraq of sanctions and allow it to rebuild its conventional military 
power. ``Many Arab countries do not fear Iraq at all,'' said Radwan 
Abdulleh, a former dean of political science at Jordan University. 
``On the contrary, they want Iraq stronger, so that it can fill the 
regional power vacuum. They think Saddam is a dictator and deserves 
to be punished. But they want Iraq strong enough to be a balance against 
Israel and Turkey and Iran, although of course not so strong that 
he can dominate the whole region.'' Few Jordanians believe that air 
strikes against Iraq would produce any positive result. ``It is the 
Iraqi people who decide whether they want Saddam or not, and they 
are capable of toppling him if they decide to,'' a columnist at a 
leading Jordanian newspaper wrote earlier this month. Iraqi opposition 
groups say that with the millions of dollars that the United States 
and Britain have promised them, their prospects of toppling Saddam 
are bright. But many independent analysts of Arab politics are doubtful. 
``These opposition people are very nice, very civilized, but they 
don't even talk to each other, much less work together,'' said a European 
ambassador based in Amman. ``As for the Arab masses, they may not 
sympathize with Saddam but they do sympathize with Iraq, which they 
see as a victim of American aggression.''
