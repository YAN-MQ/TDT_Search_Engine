Some Ohio school children want US troops in Bosnia to have a Merry 
Christmas, complete with decorations for Christmas trees. So, students 
from four Ohio cities made ornaments and wrote notes to US service 
men and women serving in the Balkan country. The decorations and notes 
will be accompanied by 30 Ohio grown Christmas trees, as part of Operation 
Evergreen. The operation President says we want to tell the service 
men and women we care about you and appreciate what you are doing. 
An Operation Evergreen participant say, maybe it will make it a bit 
more like Christmas at home.
