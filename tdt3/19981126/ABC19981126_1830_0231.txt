Russia's deteriorating military is of course a legacy of the cold 
war. And at the same time Russia's current arsenal of missiles is 
falling apart, we have learned that some of the most powerful images 
of the old Soviet military were just that -- images. Here's ABC's 
clay Scott. Victory day in Moscow. Every May 9th, since the end of 
world war II, a celebration of Soviet military might. Along with the 
cheering crowds at red square, there were foreign military attaches 
who came to see what new weaponry might be on display. In 1965, many 
of them were startled at the sight of a huge ballistic missile they 
had never seen. It was called the gr1. And it didn't work. It was 
the great lie. A great lie. Alexander kabakov knows it was a lie, 
because he helped build the gr1. He says they were dummies, hollow 
pieces of metal made to the exact specifications of a missile design. 
Moscow had already tossed on the scrap heap. It was one of many weapons 
the Soviets put on parade, that either never existed or never worked. 
The problem was russianed mixed real missiles with fake missiles ifficu 
isuit ue and what was pure fake. eporter: Military historians and 
former intelligence officials say the U.S. wasn't fooled by the dummy 
missiles, at least not for long. But successive administrations used 
images atreandre money from Congress. As the U.S. spent more money 
on the arms race, with new weapons like the minuteman missile, the 
Soviets wanted badly to keep up. And if they couldn't, they at least 
wanted to make their people believe they were. All of us knew what 
we are doing, what we must do. We must make something like that. Any 
way, we must show something like that. It's now well known how many 
of the Soviet Union's great achievements were not what they seemed, 
including some of the most frightening symbols of Soviet power. Clay 
Scott, ABC News, Moscow.
