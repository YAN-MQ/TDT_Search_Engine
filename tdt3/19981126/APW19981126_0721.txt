More than 250 women, including the king's sister, marched through 
Amman on Thursday in a quiet demonstration against domestic violence. 
The rally came two days after a father was arrested for the murder 
of his 17-year-old daughter, who had eloped with a boyfriend, and 
three days after an international conference in Amman called for judges 
to impose heavier sentences on those who commit ``crimes of honor,'' 
where men kill their female relatives for having pre-marital sex. 
Princess Basma took part in the march, which began at the offices 
of the Jordanian General Union for Women in Jabal Amman district and 
ended at a hotel 2 kilometers (1.3 miles) away. King Hussein has spoken 
out against wife battering and ``honor crimes''. ``We reject all kinds 
of (domestic) violence, because it is practiced against a creature 
who represents half of the world, and gave birth to the other half,'' 
the women's union secretary general, Nejoud Fawzi, said in a speech 
outside the hotel at the end of the march. Referring to victims of 
domestic violence, Fawzi said a woman was ``forced to marry the man 
chosen by her family, she is raped, killed and tortured.'' About 25 
women are killed each year in the name of honor in Jordan, making 
it the most common type of murder of women in the kingdom. But the 
courts impose jail sentences ranging from three months to two years 
for such crimes because of the heavy premium traditional Arab societies 
place on family honor. Delegates from 10 Middle Eastern states recommended 
Monday that their governments modernize their laws to ensure that 
those who commit violence against women receive tough penalties.
