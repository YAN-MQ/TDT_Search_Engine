Some people in the Pacific Northwest face Thanksgiving without electric 
power after two storms blasted the area this week. David Kwami, the 
spokesman for Pacific Power and Light, said the weather has eased 
enough to allow workers to get out to the fallen power lines. Weather 
conditions now are light winds, nothing compared with the 100 mile 
an hour winds that we had yesterday, which has allowed our crews to 
get out and work more effectively. Gusts of more than 110 miles per 
hour howled over parts of the Oregon coast yesterday and heavy rains 
prompted new worries about floods and mudslides.
