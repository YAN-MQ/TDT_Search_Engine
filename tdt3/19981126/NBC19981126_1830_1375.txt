Back in this country, America has lost one of its great funny men. 
Flip Wilson, whose hit TV show of the early '70s made him the first 
successful black host of a TV variety show. His skits featured flamboyant 
characters like the Reverend leroy and the unforgettable Geraldine. 
Geraldine's my name and telephones are my game. If you're having trouble 
with your circuit, I'll show you how to work it. After his show ended 
in 1974, Wilson only rarely appeared on TV. He died at his Malibu 
home of liver cancer. Flip Wilson was 64.
