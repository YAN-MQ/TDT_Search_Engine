The 300 turkeys and the pecan and pumpkin pies were flown in from 
home, but for many of the 2,500 U.S. soldiers in the Kuwaiti desert, 
the most import part of the Thanksgiving meal - family - was missing. 
``It really doesn't seem like Thanksgiving because you are away from 
the people you love,'' said Sgt. Robert Moore, 34, of Valdosta, Georgia. 
U.S. troops are celebrating Thanksgiving Thursday with elaborate meals 
in the mess hall of this camp 12 kilometers (8 miles) north of Kuwait 
City. Several hundred of the soldiers are based in the camp to maintain 
the armor and artillery that the United States keeps there to be used 
in the event of an Iraqi attack. The rest are in Kuwait to take part 
in routine war games. ``It's depressing,'' Pfc. Mick Rasband, of Pleasant 
Grove, Utah, said as he stood in line to fill his tray. Rasband said 
the food was appreciated after months of exercises in the barren desert. 
But, he added, ``it's different when you're not home.'' The meal featured 
alcohol-free eggnog, but there was no beer or wine. Alcohol is banned 
in this traditional Muslim country. Maj. Anita McCarthy-McGee, of 
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was looking on the bright side of her sixth 
holiday far from home and her six-year-old son. ``I think of it as 
six turkeys I didn't have to cook,'' she joked.
