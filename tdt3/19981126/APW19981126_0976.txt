The government has ordered an investigation into alleged irregularities 
in the dlrs 19 billion sale of federal telecommunications company 
Telebras. The general accounting office announced Thursday it will 
look into unusual financing practices in the July 29 auction for Telebras, 
which was split into 12 companies. Office director Carlos Atila said 
the National Development Bank, which financed some of the bidders, 
reportedly set some unorthodox conditions _ in one case, demanding 
that a consortium buy 25 percent of one of the spinoff companies. 
The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported that the bank offered dlrs 
1.24 billion in financing and guarantees to Brazilian-led groups, 
including dlrs 462 million in cash. The inner workings of the privatization 
were revealed in illegally taped phone conversations of the former 
communications minister, Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros. Although 
Mendonca apparently did nothing illegal, the seeming manipulation 
of the bidders shocked Brazilians. This week, Mendonca and four other 
top officials resigned.
