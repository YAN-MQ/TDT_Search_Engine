Absolutely convinced that I was going to be an audience of one, I 
arrived at ``The Fantasticks'' in the Village a little early. My thinking 
was, if the box office had tangible evidence of a bona fide ticket 
holder, the show positively had to go on. Pardon my lack of faith, 
but it was almost impossible to believe that virtually any viable 
life form on the planet had not already paid a visit to this cozy 
art-house musical, which has run at the Sullivan Street Playhouse 
for, gulp, 38 years and, as of Dec. 18, fully 16,000 performances. 
As it had opened six months before John F. Kennedy was elected President, 
one had to wonder: What claim could it conceivably make to having 
an untapped market? Realistically, how many Himalayan sherpas, Trappist 
monks or Antarctic climatologists will be trolling for twofers at 
the TKTS booth in the coming years? I came in out of the rain on a 
recent Friday evening and took my seat in the cramped middle of the 
back row; although reviewers ordinarily inform a producer about when 
they will attend, I decided to come unannounced. And when I looked 
around the theater, I saw the oddest thing. People. Lots and lots 
of people. New Yorkers, out-of-towners, teen-age girls, middle-aged 
couples, you name it, filing in and filling three-quarters of the 
tiny auditorium. Who were they? I knew why I was there; why were they? 
The lights went down before I could absorb the shock. But as soon 
as that plucky piano overture commenced _ ``BUM-bum. Bum BUM BUM BUM. 
Ba-da BUM BUM'' _ I had the answer: a big bunch of softies is what 
they were, and they had come to the right place. Despite advancing 
age, ``The Fantasticks,'' it turns out, can not only still put up 
a charming front but it appears able to renew itself. With its capable 
cast, no-frills set, romantic score and unabashed celebration of innocence, 
the musical retains the power to overwhelm cynicism with lyricism, 
to make itself, in fact, seem eternally young. In the stable of off-Broadway 
warhorses, ``The Fantasticks'' may be the eldest, but it's far from 
the only senior citizen. ``Perfect Crime'' at the Duffy Theater in 
Times Square has been running since 1987; Tony 'n' Tina have been 
getting married in raucous interactive ceremonies at various Manhattan 
locations for a decade, and ``Blue Man Group'' has been spewing disgusting 
fluids at audiences in the Astor Place Theater on Lafayette Street 
for seven years. These and other multiyear phenoms, like ``Stomp,'' 
``Forbidden Broadway'' and ``I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change,'' 
have become such permanent fixtures that off-Broadway _ where plays 
have a reputation of coming and going like commuters through the turnstiles 
_ now is home to nearly as many long-running hits as Broadway. And 
like the big Broadway musicals that run and run, these off-Broadway 
perennials depend more and more on an alien audience pool _ the tourist 
trade _ that traditionally avoided the city's smaller theaters. Like 
an overscheduled medical resident, I recently made the rounds of 7 
of the 10 off-Broadway shows that have been running a year or more 
(actually one, ``Shakespeare's R &AMP; J,'' is only just approaching 
its first birthday) to check their pulses, to generally assess the 
effects of the passage of time. I opted not to revisit three: ``Tony 
'n' Tina's Wedding'' and ``Late Nite Catechism,'' because, as interactive 
shows, they are by nature different every night, and ``Perfect Crime,'' 
because this convoluted thriller was such a stupefying mess when I 
sat through it a year ago, the thought of returning felt like asking 
for a second dose of measles. Overall, for the shows I visited, production 
standards remained surprisingly high, even for ``The Fantasticks,'' 
which would have every reason to devolve into a wheezing basket case. 
Some, like ``Stomp,'' the dance-and-rhythm extravaganza that sets 
the beat to garbage-can lids, kitchen sinks and brooms, are remarkably 
fresh, while others, like ``Blue Man Group,'' the witty, cerebral 
prankfest, have gone just a tad stale: after seven years in the East 
Village, some new tricks would be welcome up its slightly tattered 
sleeve. In virtually every production, however, there was the pleasure 
of discovering, or rediscovering, an exceptional performer, as with 
Bryan Batt in ``Forbidden Broadway Cleans Up Its Act!'' or Adam Grupper 
in ``I Love You, You're Perfect,'' or Allison Munn and Eric Meyersfield, 
as the Girl and Boy in ``The Fantasticks,'' or the three new cast 
members, Matt Dill, Jeremy Peter Johnson and Caesar Samayoa, in ``R 
&AMP; J.'' Here then, in approximate descending order of enjoyment, 
is a quick excursion back into the heavily charted territory of the 
long runs: `Forbidden Broadway Cleans Up Its Act!' Will the American 
Theater Wing ever swallow its pride and give Gerard Alessandrini the 
Tony he deserves? No one, in truth, is more slavishly devoted to the 
Broadway legend than the creator of this bottomlessly entertaining 
parody revue, which just unveiled its new edition at the Stardust 
Theater. Alessandrini's targets should all plead with him to keep 
them in the show, as a ``Forbidden Broadway'' knock is confirmation 
that one still moves with enough force to make the needle move on 
the theater district's seismometer. Bryan Batt, one of the show's 
quartet of singing parodists, comes into his own in this revised production, 
which by virtue of some scrumptious new material does the ``Forbidden 
Broadway'' franchise proud. Whether it's his devastating impression 
of Mandy Patinkin, singing an overwrought ``I Have A Little Dreidel'' 
_ a takeoff on Patinkin's evening of Yiddish folk music, ``Mamaloshen'' 
_ or his uproarious sendup of the baboon character in ``The Lion King,,'' 
Batt always gets to the fiendish point without a trace of remorse. 
He makes you happy that Broadway is such an easy mark. Although the 
other players are not up to his level _ the show misses the talents 
of versatile stalwarts like Christine Pedi and Michael McGrath, both 
of whom are in ``Little Me'' _ they're strong enough to pull off Alessandrini's 
sharpest stuff. This is true, for example, of Kristine Zbornik's parody 
of Julie Taymor, the director of ``The Lion King,'' demonstrating 
her design skills on a Lamb Chop-like sock puppet, or Edward Staudenmayer's 
funny impression of Alan Cumming, the ``Cabaret'' master of ceremonies, 
donning lederhosen and infiltrating the von Trapp family in a giddy 
``Sound of Music'' interlude. New pieces on ``Footloose'' _ ``Loose/Footloose/Why 
is our po-ster puce?'' _ and ``Ragtime'' _ ``The people call it `Gagtime''' 
_ are bullseyes, as are skits about the fake reporter in those ``Broadway 
Buzz'' commercials and a song about ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' 
called ``How Are Things in Irish Drama?'' sung to the tune of ``How 
are Things in Glocca Mora?'' Some jokes inevitably are going to sputter 
in this format, which is borne out by the all-too-easy, limp-wristed 
assault on ``Swan Lake'' and an off-point skewering of Ann Miller. 
More often, however, the retaining of some fabulous older skits, like 
a divine extended parody of ``Titanic'' that makes fun of its elaborate 
sinking set and clunky crowd-scene management, reveal how durable 
and renewable this resource is. If anything holds Alessandrini back, 
it's the unfortunate dearth of big Broadway stars to set up for hilarious 
falls. That Julie Andrews, Ethel Merman and Ms. Miller remain the 
most prominent faces on the revue's dart board says a lot about the 
tarnished condition of Broadway glitter. `Shakespeare's R&AMP;J' The 
show is a relative infant among the long runs, and how long it will 
survive is unclear; it is scheduled to close in early January. But 
this simple, clever production, born in a Lower East Side storefront 
and transferred to a slightly larger theater on West 42nd Street, 
has matured greatly since reopening at the John Houseman Studio Theater 
last January, and it deserves the opportunity to evolve some more. 
The premise was never easy to dramatize: four students at a stern 
boy's school, perhaps a Roman Catholic prep school, gather secretly 
one evening to act out all the parts in ``Romeo and Juliet.'' Joe 
Calarco's inspired direction of four enthusiastic young actors underlined 
not only the homoerotic aspects but the universally romantic elements 
of the play. Despite a few stagey conceits, including grafting on 
passages from ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' the adaptation worked 
amazingly well. It now works even better. This has a lot to do, it 
seems, with the discipline that sometimes comes over time with the 
handling of a complex text. Of the original cast, only Greg Shamie, 
who plays Romeo, remains, and while the three who departed were excellent 
_ and Daniel J. Shore, the original Juliet, was particularly good 
_ their replacements are no less impressive. Jeremy Peter Johnson, 
who plays the Nurse, among other characters, and Matt Dill, as Mercutio, 
bring a level of comfort with the verse and intuition about Shakespeare 
that make both actors fascinating to observe in the spare surroundings 
of the studio theater. Caesar Samayoa's Juliet is a fully realized 
creation as well, especially in the play's final scenes, as he passes 
from infatuated teen-ager to panicked lover, and Shamie's Romeo has 
grown in emotional and technical command. The action sequences are 
more deliberate now; in my third viewing of the play, it also seemed 
more wrenching. ``R&AMP;J'' may be the unlikeliest of the long-runners, 
which only makes it a more intriguing example of the vitality of downtown 
theater. `Stomp' Little having to do with ``Stomp'' is mild or muted, 
not even the admonition to the audience before it begins. ``If you're 
taking photographs,'' warns the voice over the public address system, 
``your film will be taken away from you.'' Are they kidding? Yes, 
of course, flashbulbs are dangerous distractions in the Stompers' 
split-second choreography, but is the management really up to confiscating 
personal items, like guards posted outside Czech air bases during 
the Cold War? Chalk it up to hubris. The show next week celebrates 
its 2,000th performance at the Orpheum Theater, a milestone that would 
excuse a certain arrogance, if not a level of creative and physical 
exhaustion. But such excuses aren't necessary. ``Stomp'' is as crisp 
and exuberant as if it had opened yesterday. The performers remain 
a wholly original, precision marching band of working stiffs, who 
take everyday tools and articles and make them shake and rattle to 
ancient and contemporary rhythms. The eight men and women know a lot 
about making noise and making you laugh, but what was most exhilarating 
this time around were the subtler forms of percussion coaxed from 
cigarette lighters, soft drink containers and shopping bags. In any 
event, there's no possibility of turning down the volume on the explosive 
joy in the Orpheum. `The Fantasticks' OK, so the current El Gallo, 
John Savarese, rushes through those gloriously purple monologues, 
the sort you might have scribbled down in your own high school notebooks 
and immediately ripped up because even then they made your lips pucker. 
Maybe rapid deployment is the only way to handle El Gallo's poetic 
efforts. Still, part of the fun of ``The Fantasticks'' is joining 
in the pretense that all of life is a gauzy romance. It's El Gallo 
who spins the fantasy, for the archetypal Boy and Girl as well as 
for the audience, with his reminder of the kind of September ``when 
love was an ember about to billow.'' The timeless musical lives on 
in part because the atmospheric music and lyrics by Harvey Schmidt 
and Tom Jones contain all the warming flavors of memory. (That sound 
purple enough?) ``Metaphor,'' ``Soon It's Gonna Rain,'' ``Try to Remember,'' 
``They Were You'': is there a more serenely nostalgic score in all 
of musical comedy? It's no chore at all to listen to these songs again, 
especially since many of them are sung so well by the current cast 
members. To be sure, the show is not as fresh as it once was _ ``The 
Fantasticks'' is perhaps the only show in town with a permanent museum 
devoted to itself _ but it's surprising how well it holds up. Thanks 
to Eric Meyersfield and Allison Munn, portraying the Boy and Girl, 
the story of young love never becomes the spoonful of treacle that 
perpetually threatens. As their fathers, Gordon G. Jones and William 
Tost are delightful cranks. In their hands, ``Never Say No'' and ``Plant 
a Radish'' supply the evening's wryest comedy. It could be that after 
the excesses of the rapidly fading era of the megamusical, tastes 
may swing back to the kind of old-fashioned theatrical values embodied 
by ``The Fantasticks.'' And if they do, is there any doubt that this 
show will be around to take full advantage? `Blue Man Group' Although 
this production makes ample use of a variety of gooky substances, 
``Blue Man Group'' may be due for an oil change. Audiences still emerge 
merrily from their 90-minute encounter with three poker-faced young 
men dyed shiny blue, but after seven years and 3,285 performances 
you can detect, at times, a drop-off in spectator reaction. The show, 
parts satire, hazing ritual and Grateful Dead concert, seems unchanged 
from the production I saw three years ago, and some of the jokes have 
hair on them. This is especially true of the conceptual-art humor. 
For example, a bit in which each blue man expresses, through personal 
electronic messages, critical evaluations of a dessicated fish framed 
and mounted on a wall _ ``I want to forget the fish,'' ``I want to 
curate the fish,'' ``I want to fillet the fish'' _ drifts off like 
a dead fish. Certainly, ``Blue Man Group,'' which calls this production 
``Tubes,'' for the sets of plastic piping on which the blue men tap 
out ethereal music, has a fail-safe recipe: Children will love the 
terrible ways Twinkies, marshmallows and Cap'n Crunch cereal are abused. 
But couldn't a few new spices be added? The group prides itself on 
its mockery of intellectual pretension and laziness. When the blue 
men themselves begin to appear a little stodgy, can a full-blown parody 
of ``Blue Man Group'' be far behind? ``I Love You, You're Perfect, 
Now Change'' ``When a show runs this long,'' said a friend, as we 
took our seats for this two-year-old production at the Westside Theater, 
``there has to be a reason.'' There is. The audience seemed charmed 
by Joe Dipietro's and Jimmy Roberts' amiable boy-meets-girl revue, 
a middle-of-the-road kind of sendup of dating and marriage. Never 
much of a challenge, the show mostly confirms what the ticket buyers 
already know, and that level of familiarity makes it easy to sit through. 
Its humor has been compared to ``Seinfeld,'' but the more apt model 
is ``Love, American Style,'' the prim, dated television comedy show 
of the early 1970s . Dipietro and Roberts have a jolly style of their 
own, but they rarely take risks. The characters, played by two men 
and two women, are desperate types in search of love and security. 
The song titles alone tell you just how unadventurous the authors 
mean to be: ``A Stud and a Babe,'' ``Why? 'Cause I'm a Guy,'' ``Marriage 
Tango,'' ``Shouldn't I Be Less in Love With You?'' The sensibility 
is not exactly cutting edge. In ``Single Man Drought,'' the line ``I 
should be a lesbian!'' gets the show's biggest laugh. The four singing 
actors _ Adam Grupper, Kevin Pariseau, Erin Leigh Peck and Cheryl 
Stern _ attack the material like marines storming the beaches. Among 
these thoroughgoing pros, the talented Grupper is a particular pleasure. 
Playing macho-nerdy everyguys, you can sense his polish, as well as 
the fact that he is being asked to apply only about 40 percent of 
his capabilities. ``Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know'' Another 
evening, another revue. This cabaret-formatted yearling, newly moved 
to the Ibis Theater, about the headaches and horrors of travel (and 
inspired by a travel guide of the same name by Wendy Perrin) has some 
sweet spots. The sweetest: a funny number performed by Jay Leonhart 
about smuggling exotic animals through customs. All in all, though, 
it proves to be a fairly thin premise for a full-fledged off-Broadway 
show. As with ``I Love You, You're Perfect,'' you have to endure some 
fairly sparkless stuff _ a Noel Coward takeoff being the flattest 
_ to get to the occasional fizz. Never painful, but never soaring, 
the experience is a lot like modern air travel. You spend a lot of 
time waiting on the runway. Here is information on the shows mentioned
