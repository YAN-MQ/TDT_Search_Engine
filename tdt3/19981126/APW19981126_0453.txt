A Labor Party lawmaker has urged Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to lodge 
a formal complaint about an attack on a British Broadcasting Corp. 
news crew reporting on Gen. Augusto Pinochet's legal saga in the Chilean 
capital of Santiago. BBC correspondent Ben Brown, his producer and 
his cameraman were dragged into a building and kicked and punched 
by up to 100 people Wednesday, shortly after Britain's highest court 
ruled that Pinochet had no immunity from arrest on Spanish charges 
of murder, torture and genocide. Brown said the assailants were supporters 
of Pinochet, Chile's former dictator. He said he and the two members 
of his crew were bruised and badly shaken, but not seriously injured. 
Lawmaker Ben Bradshaw, a former BBC reporter, wrote to Cook asking 
him to file a formal complaint with the Chilean ambassador to Britain. 
At no stage did authorities intervene to help the three men, Bradshaw 
said Thursday. ``This is quite unacceptable in a country that calls 
itself a democracy,'' he said. ``I imagine there is plenty of evidence 
on film so that the perpetrators of this violence can be brought to 
justice.'' The Foreign Office said it would have no immediate comment 
on Bradshaw's request.
