Comedian flip Wilson is being remembered as a breakthrough artist 
whose humor crossed all lines. Wilson died last night of liver cancer 
at his home in Malibu, California. In the 1970s, Wilson became the 
first successful black host of a television variety show. But that's 
not all he accomplished. Dennis Michael recalls the highlights of 
Wilson's career. "The flip Wilson show!" And here's flip! "the flip 
Wilson show" ran from 1970 to 1974 on NBC. The phenomenally popular 
stand-up comic was clearly an artist of his time. You are? I'm Geraldine 
Jones. Cool, calm, and here to collect, honey. Clerow Wilson came 
by his nickname "flip" because of his way of talking back to his superiors 
in the air force. He came by his successful series after scores of 
guest stints, sitting in for Johnny Carson on "the tonight show." 
Amen. Truly wonderful. Wilson was also often a supporting player in 
comedy films of the '70s. He's seen in "uptown Saturday night" here, 
backing up Bill Cosby and Sidney poitier. But his biggest starring 
vehicle, "the fish that saved Pittsburgh," was quickly relegated to 
the back shelf of film history. Sorry, coach. In an era of angry black 
comedians, flip Wilson was an amiable and relaxed exception. After 
a failed situation comedy in the early '80s, flip Wilson effectively 
retired from the entertainment industry to raise his children out 
of the spotlight. His hit series recently returned to television on 
the tvland network. Good night Y'all. Wilson spent the last years 
of his life pursuing his passion for hot air ballooning, taking long 
ocean cruises and studying the works of philosopher khalil gibran. 
Flip Wilson was 64.
