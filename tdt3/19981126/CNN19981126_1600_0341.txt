A republican member of the house Judiciary committee says staff members 
have begun drafting articles of impeachment for possible consideration 
by the whole panel. The member, who asked to remain anonymous, said 
the emphasis rests on obstruction of justice, perjury and abuse of 
power. Those are the categories laid out by committee chairman Henry 
Hyde. But a senior White House official is dismissing reports the 
committee is drawing up articles of impeachment. He calls the process 
"absurd." The official says the Judiciary committee will get the president's 
signed answers to 81 questions tomorrow.
