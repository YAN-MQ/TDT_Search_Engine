European football's governing body has thrown out England's appeal 
against a fine for racial abuse by its supporters at the Uerafo two 
thousand qualifier in Sweden. Uerafo objected the appeal Wednesday 
after evidence from the referee and a Uerafo delegate revealed English 
fans were guilty of abuse during the September match. Witnesses say 
English fans directed racist chants at Sweden's Hundry Larson on at 
least eight occasions during the game.
