Psychiatrist Eyad Sarraj, who has been jailed for speaking out against 
Palestinian authorities, has won the Martin Ennals Award for Human 
Rights Defenders, it was announced Friday. ``He is active in the field 
of rehabilitation of torture survivors and prevention of torture,'' 
said Adama Dieng, president of the Martin Ennals Foundation. ``His 
involvement in human rights issues has exposed him on several occasions 
to threatening situations and resulted in his own imprisonment and 
torture. His open criticism of the Palestinian National Authority 
has placed him in great danger.'' Sarraj is the founder and director 
of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program. He has been imprisoned 
three times by the Palestinian authorities. ``Dr. El Sarraj has developed 
an independent mental health service which provides urgently needed 
support for the large number of people affected by the upheaval of 
the Intifada and the organized violence perpetrated under Israeli 
occupation,'' Dieng added. The Martin Ennals award was created in 
1993 to commemorate the life-long human rights campaigner who created 
several human rights organizations including International Alert and 
who helped build up Amnesty International. The first award was given 
to Chinese dissident Harry Wu in 1994 for his work against forced 
labor in China.
