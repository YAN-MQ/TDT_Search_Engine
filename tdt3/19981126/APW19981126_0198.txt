Even though the health dangers of smoking are well known, tobacco's 
threat to children is greatly underemphasized, anti-smoking activists 
said Thursday. Representatives of the World Health Organization, the 
Thai public health sector, UNICEF and a worldwide coalition of private 
organizations spoke at a news conference announcing the Asian launch 
of a ``Declaration on Growing Up Without Tobacco.'' The launch, part 
of a wider anti-smoking campaign, came at an international meeting 
about tuberculosis and lung disease. ``The WHO estimates that about 
250 million children alive today will eventually be killed by tobacco 
if, in the future, children continue to take up smoking at the same 
rate as today's adults and adolescents,'' said Neil Collishaw of the 
U.N. health agency. ``As the profits from sales in Asia grow, the 
importance of Asia's youth market grows, and marketing to young people 
will not abate,'' said Karen Slama of the International Non-Governmental 
Coalition Against Tobacco. ``It is not only the effects of the marketing 
onslaught and the growing prevalence of tobacco use that is playing 
havoc with the future of children in Asia,'' she said. ``With little 
protection from the smoke from others' cigarette use in addition to 
other pollutants, children and young people have more severe respiratory 
health problems more often. ``But the omnipresence of tobacco marketing 
gives people the idea that exposure to tobacco smoke is not a problem,'' 
she said. Maternal and paternal smoking both pose significant health 
risks to the fetus and newborn child, said Rudolf Knippenberg, a regional 
adviser in UNICEF's East Asian and Pacific office. An expectant mother's 
smoking causes carbon monoxide and nicotine to pass into the placenta 
and into the bloodstream of the fetus, he said. The results include 
lower birth weight _ 200 grams (7 ounces) on average _ which has an 
adverse effect on future health and growth. They also include a 25 
percent higher risk of miscarriage and a 30 percent increase in premature 
deliveries, stillbirths and perinatal deaths, he said. The effects 
of secondhand tobacco smoke on pregnant women are also passed to the 
fetus, Knippenberg said. Being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke 
all day is the same as smoking two to three cigarettes a day, and 
studies suggest that the level of tobacco products in the fetus are 
the same as in the mother, he said. Infants born to mothers exposed 
to passive smoke also experience decreased birth weights, averaging 
30-40 grams (1-1.5 ounces), he said. The effects of secondhand smoke 
on young children include more respiratory infections, aggravation 
of asthma and more school days lost to sickness than among children 
from non-smoking families, he said. Asian countries have made great 
strides in reducing mortality rates among children under 5 years of 
age, said Knippenberg, but they risk losing the investment made to 
achieve this by neglecting to give serious attention to the dangers 
tobacco poses to children.
