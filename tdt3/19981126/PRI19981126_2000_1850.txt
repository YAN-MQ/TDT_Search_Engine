Forthe first time, a British prime minister has addressed the Irish 
parliament. Prime Minister Blair said he's honored to be the first 
to do so since Ireland gained independence. Later, the Irish Prime 
Minister, Bertie Ahern, pledged to continue operating in the Northern 
Ireland peace process. I think what he said to us, the messages that 
he's given about the requirements for cooperation to continue to build 
a peace and reconciliation and justice is something that we all understand. 
And we're determined as ever to move on and to do everything that 
we can to to go try the agreements and all the later discussions over 
this year at watch. Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
