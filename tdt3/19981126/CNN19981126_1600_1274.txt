With "CNN Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven. We begin with the NFL, 
where a wild one took place in the motor city between Pittsburgh and 
Detroit. It went to overtime, and on the coin toss, Jerome Bettis 
appeared to call "Tails." The coin landed on tails, but the refs thought 
he heard "heads," so Detroit got the ball. And wouldn't you know, 
Charlie batch led his troops down the field, where jason Hanson kicked 
the game-winner. 19-16, lions. In the other game, Dallas hosts Minnesota.
