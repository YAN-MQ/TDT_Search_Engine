Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports." -- The traditional Thanksgiving 
day game in Detroit was filled with hard hits, lucky bounces and terrible 
calls, but none worse than the one made by referee Phil luckett, who 
insisted that Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis called heads during the overtime 
coin toss, giving the ball and eventually the game to the lions 19-16.
