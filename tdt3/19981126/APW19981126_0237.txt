Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki shot a 5-under-par 67 Thursday and took a one-stroke 
lead in the opening round of the Casio World Open, while most of the 
gallery followed Tiger Woods. With Woods playing his first regular 
tournament in Japan, more than 5,000 spectators turned out. The American 
star shot four birdies against one bogey and was two shots behind 
the leader at 69. Ozaki, the youngest of three Ozaki brothers on the 
Japan PGA Tour, sank six birdies against one bogey on the 7,105-yard 
(6,467-meter), par-72 Ibusuki Golf Club course. Joe, a regular on 
the U.S. tour, is in contention for his first victory this season 
and 26th overall. Hidemichi Tanaka, the Japan Open winner last month, 
had a round of five birdies and a bogey and shared second place at 
68 with Mamoru Osanai and American Paul Stankowski. Woods was tied 
at 69 with fellow American Brian Watts, Toshimitsu Izawa, Nobumitsu 
Yuhara, Yoshinori Kaneko and South Korean Kim Jong-duk. Japanese superstar 
Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, Joe's eldest brother, and Americans Brandt 
Jobe and Todd Hamilton shared 11th at 70 with four others in the 150 
million yen (dlrs 1.25 million) tournament.
