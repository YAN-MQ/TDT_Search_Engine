While many Americans are giving thanks this holiday, several hundred 
native americans are protesting. They've gathered at the site of the 
first Thanksgiving, Plymouth, massachusetts, for the 29th annual American 
Indians day of mourning. One leader says they have no reason to give 
thanks for what he calls the "European invasion of our land and the 
genocide of our people."
