Coming up, we walk through the doors of perception on PRI. The holidays 
are coming and for most of us, that means spending time with their 
families. It's rituals like these that really hold families together. 
That's what writer Meg Cox discovered when she interviewed over 200 
families. I'm Dane Gottlieb, and on the next "Voices in the Family," 
as part of WHYY's Family and Food Week, we'll explore family rituals. 
That's Sunday morning at here on 91 FM, WHYY. This is THE WORLD. I'm 
Tony Kahn.
