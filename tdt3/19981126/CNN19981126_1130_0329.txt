The northwest is recovering from its second strong storm system in 
three days. Heavy rains and strong winds set off mudslides, toppled 
trees, blew over mobile homes and left many residents without power. 
Flood watches are in effect for several of Oregon's coastal counties. 
The rain is expected to continue through this afternoon.
