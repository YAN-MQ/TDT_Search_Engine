Turkeys, 250 of them, were being given to school kids the other day 
in the Bronx. Keyshawn Johnson had bought them and was distributing 
them, showing his giving side. The calm, mature, quiet side. A rare 
time when he allows others to grab center stage. Back in January during 
Super Bowl festivities in San Diego, Johnson threw a club party heavily 
attended by some of the National Football League's biggest stars. 
The party was for his youth foundation, Key's Kids, based in Los Angeles, 
his hometown. Derrick Thomas was there. So were Jerome Bettis and 
Bruce Smith and so many others, an NFL star in every corner of the 
room. The music grooved. The lights dimmed. The crowd inside, more 
than 500, celebrated. The crowd outside, more than 500 in line, waited. 
Inside, some of the very peers who attended and smiled in his face, 
would mock the event and him. It went this way: ``Key's party? It 
was OK. Key? So hungry for attention. He thinks he's a great player 
already and look what he's done. Next to nothing. He likes the hype. 
But really, that's all Key is _ hype.'' This was a sampling of the 
banter after Johnson's good deed. It is the kind of talk that follows 
after an unflattering deed. After a good game. After a bad game. It 
is the kind of stuff that follows Keyshawn Johnson everywhere. Many 
of those thoughts come from people his friend on the Jets, Chris Hayes, 
calls ``haters.'' ``Haters, haters, and they come in all forms,'' 
Hayes said of his term for what others call ``player haters'' _ guys 
who dislike guys they in reality envy. ``Haters are going to be haters,'' 
Hayes said. ``Anyone that truly knows Key separates perception from 
reality.'' Now really, that's the crux of it with Keyshawn Johnson. 
Perception. Reality. Sometimes they intertwine and become hopelessly 
muddled. Perception says he is all ``I,'' not a fiber of being a team 
player in him. Totally interested in getting the ball, catching passes, 
setting records at wide receiver, setting more records after that, 
winning adulation, endorsements, movie roles, Hollywood and on and 
on and on. All Keyshawn. Reality, though, is quite different. He is 
a newer-age Deion Sanders, offensive to some, difficult to ignore, 
and as a football player, capable of backing up whatever he barks. 
And that is one reason he strikes such a stinging chord with so many. 
Turns out, he is often right. Listen: ``As long as I'm in the heart, 
reaching hearts when I do charity, that's all that matters to me,'' 
Johnson said before practice on Wednesday as the Jets prepared for 
Sunday's visit from the Carolina Panthers. ``When people say black 
athlete, inner-city athlete, Generation X athlete, we know what that 
means. From the streets to the game is what they are saying. But that 
is only part of me. ``My success now _ I am more than a Rolex and 
a Ferrari. And you will not understand me if you don't try and get 
to know me and get a feel for who I am. If you don't, you end up just 
blinded by who you're dealing with. ``I grew up in a household of 
17, two families in one, and there were nine women in all, strong 
black women. They taught me to be a king. I think of myself that way, 
and that is the way I think of myself as a football player _ and that 
is where the bad perceptions from many come in. ``I am a team player 
_ but I am an individual first. I am going to shine. I know that I 
have electricity. My electricity can make everyone soar. I want the 
football. I want to block. I want to win. I want to do it all and 
I can. And I have to be the No. 1 guy with the football. Not No. 2 
or No. 3. It's like a company, a business; I can't be a vice-president. 
I've got to be president. If I'm not the No. 1 guy, I'm no good to 
you. That's who I am.'' He is a dart board. A bull's-eye. He is an 
easy target because he is so eager, so confident, so hungry to succeed 
and to shine and say so. Others see that and say calm down. Sit down. 
Shut up. And they toss darts his way. They shoot arrows. If only Keyshawn 
could keep all of that attitude inside. Speak softly. ``Hey, my mother 
taught me to speak my mind and to tell the truth,'' Johnson said. 
And that the truth is the light of the world. ``So, I'm gonna say 
what's on my mind,'' he said. ``Coach Parcells understands that. He's 
the same way. I think he wants more players like that, who will stand 
up and who will back it up and make plays.'' It is starting to come 
together for Johnson now. A breakout game last week against Tennessee 
and a breakout season are setting the stage. Center stage, for him. 
He leads the American Football Conference in touchdown catches with 
eight; the last Jet to lead the AFC in touchdown receptions was Wesley 
Walker with 12, and that was 12 years ago. And did you know that Johnson 
through 41 games has one more catch than Jerry Rice did through his 
first 41? It is his size (6 feet 3 inches, 212 pounds). His hands. 
His speed. His improved routes, his fluid moves. His heart. His courage. 
His desire. His attitude. That's the real thing. Attitude. Johnson 
has so much of it, and it is still developing. He is still developing. 
He is 26. This is his third pro season. He is just hitting his stride. 
He has yet to become what he will be. He knows that so many, some 
even close, some only a few lockers down from his, do not understand 
him. Don't know him. Don't care much for his style. Wish he would 
sit down. Shut up. But the Jets must have known what they were getting 
when they drafted Keyshawn Johnson with the overall No. 1 pick of 
the 1996 draft. He did not try to hustle them. He has not tried to 
hustle us. ``I shoot from the hip,'' Johnson said. ``A lot of people 
live in a fictitious world. I speak reality.'' His reality. He is 
the socket. He is telling us, his teammates, his coaches, Jets fans, 
everyone, to stick their plugs in snugly and get a jolt of his electricity. 
He has enough to charge us all, he said. Are we willing to dare try?
