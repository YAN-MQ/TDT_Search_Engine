Former President Canaan Banana was convicted Thursday of 11 counts 
of sodomy and homosexual assault, and prosecutors confirmed he had 
fled the country. Banana, a Methodist minister, was asking for political 
asylum in neighboring Botswana after leaving the country Nov. 17 ahead 
of the verdict, said Chief Prosecutor Augustine Chikumira. Zimbabwe 
will seek extradition, he said. The guilty verdict on all counts came 
after a three-week trial in June. Banana faces an estimated maximum 
sentence of 22 years in prison at sentencing Dec. 10. Judge Godfrey 
Chidyausiku issued an arrest warrant and ordered bail revoked. Banana 
had been free on bail of 20,000 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 600), and had 
surrendered his passport and deed to his mansion in the exclusive 
Mount Pleasant suburb of Harare. The judge urged defense lawyer Chris 
Andersen to try to persuade Banana to return to Zimbabwe for sentencing. 
The case has deeply embarrassed President Robert Mugabe, who insists 
homosexuality is foreign to African culture and was brought to the 
continent from the West. He has launched an outspoken campaign against 
homosexuality, describing same-sex partners as ``lower than pigs and 
dogs.'' The stance in southern Africa is not unusual. Government officials 
of nearby Namibia and Zambia have made similar anti-gay statements. 
South Africa has bucked the trend and recently decriminalized gay 
sex. The offenses attributed to Banana mostly involved bodyguards, 
a cook and a gardener on his presidential staff. They took place when 
he was president after independence in 1980 until 1987. Prosecutors 
alleged Banana used his authority as the nation's titular president 
to force the individuals into homosexual acts. In his court defense 
in June, Banana said the charges were an attempt to destroy his character 
and political standing amid rumors he was planning a political comeback. 
Banana's presidency after the former British colony of Rhodesia became 
independent Zimbabwe was a ceremonial post, but he was constitutional 
head of Zimbabwe when Mugabe, the nation's only political ruler, was 
prime minister. The ceremonial presidency and prime minister's position 
were abolished in 1987, and Mugabe assumed the mantle of executive 
president. Banana was brought to trial after a police inspector shot 
dead a colleague who taunted him as ``Banana's wife.'' Jefta Dube, 
serving a 10-year prison term for that murder, said he was forced 
into a three-year sexual relationship with Banana between 1984 and 
1986.
