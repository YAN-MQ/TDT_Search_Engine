Chile's Economy Minister says the British High Court decision to block 
General Augusto Pinochet's claim of immunity will not effect foreign 
investments. Jorhey Layva acknowledges the verdict itself, and the 
violent reactions it spawned in Chile have effected the overseas image 
of the country. But, he anticipates the flow of foreign investments 
will continue at its normal pace. Meanwhile Santiago began returning 
to normal today, after opponents and supporters of General Pinochet 
clashed with police. Police used water cannon and tear gas to control 
the crowds in the capitol and other cities. More than 100 demonstrators 
were arrested.
