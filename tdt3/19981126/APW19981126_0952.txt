An Iraqi opposition group disputed Thursday government reports of 
an assassination attempt on the life of Saddam Hussein's deputy. Baghdad 
``falsified'' the reports to ``increase repression'' on Shiite Muslims 
in southern and central Iraq, said a statement by the London-based 
Iraqi National Congress. The statement was also read over the Iraqi 
Broadcasting Corporation, a radio station that operates in northern 
Iraq and is affiliated to INC, an umbrella of several Iraqi opposition 
groups. State-run Baghdad television reported Monday that assailants 
threw two grenades at Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy as he got out 
of his car Sunday in the central Shiite holy city of Karbala to attend 
a religious ceremony. He was unhurt. ``The (Iraqi) regime falsified 
this attack in order to increase repression of the Shiite people in 
central and southern Iraq,'' said the INC statement that was faxed 
to The Associated Press office in Cairo. Baghdad television said several 
bodyguards and bystanders were wounded in the assassination attempt. 
The INC statement said that on the day of the alleged attack, Ibrahim 
_ who is Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary Command Council 
and deputy commander of the Iraqi armed forces _ was leading troops 
from the elite Republican Guard, the Emergency Units and Saddam's 
Fedayeen, as part of the ``national campaign to capture (army) deserters.'' 
Saddam's Fedayeen is a paramilitary force of 40,000 run by Saddam's 
eldest son, Odai. The Emergency Units is part of the Iraqi army, specialized 
in combating riots, rebellions and other disturbances. Clashes broke 
out between Ibrahim's forces and the Shiites as arrests were being 
made, and a number of soldiers were killed, said the INC statement. 
``But there was no attempt against Izzat Ibrahim personally.'' It 
said the assassination attempt was falsified to justify the ``mass 
arrests of young people in the town'' and the ensued clashes between 
Ibrahim's forces and the people of Karbala. It said the campaign to 
capture army deserters was launched on Nov. 7 in several Iraqi towns 
in the southern marshes where thousands of deserters and Shiite rebels 
take refuge and carry out hit-and-run attacks against government forces.
