Labor unions want the government to spend more money next year on 
welfare, education and the civil service, Labor Minister Longin Komolowski 
said he would tell Thursday's Cabinet meeting. Komolowski spoke after 
a meeting Wednesday with the tripartite commission of government, 
business and labor leaders. Earlier this month, Komolowski acknowledged 
the government formulated its 1999 spending plan without consulting 
Poland's powerful labor unions, but he said changes could be made 
by amendments from the tripartite commission. At Wednesday's meeting, 
major labor groups said spending priorities should be changed. Solidarity, 
the conservative labor backbone of the major partner in the governing 
alliance, believes the budget must be recalculated, officials said 
after the meeting. They said the budget fails to provide welfare payments 
for increased energy charges, cover the cost of bringing civil service 
wages in line with the private sector, or increase education spending. 
Stefan Kubowicz, the Solidarity education spokesman, said the education 
budget was based on this year's spending, which was too low. He noted 
some schools were unable to pay December salaries. The biggest trade 
union federation, the left-leaning OPZZ, also called for more spending 
on social needs. But Ryszard Lepik, one of the OPZZ's deputy leaders, 
said the federation doubted the government would change the budget. 
Poland has implemented market-led economic reforms that include stringent 
fiscal discipline to create strong growth after decades of centrist 
communist rule. Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, the main proponent 
of the reforms, has warned repeatedly against overspending or increasing 
public debt. Balcerowicz, who also is deputy prime minister, this 
week complained the union movement is too strong after Transport Minister 
Eugeniusz Morawski resigned in a dispute over reforming the strapped 
state railway company. Morawski, who belongs to Balcerowicz's Freedom 
Union in the governing alliance, quit over what he called the government's 
delay in proceeding with railway reforms because of union opposition. 
Balcerowicz said the resignation showed a ``great weakness of the 
Polish political system _ the excessively strong political role of 
trade unions, which is dangerous for the development of the country.''
