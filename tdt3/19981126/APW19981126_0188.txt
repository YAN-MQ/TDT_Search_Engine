Philippine stocks fell Thursday as investors continued to cash in 
on gains registered in recent sessions, traders said. The 30-share 
Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 37.61 points, or 1.9 percent, 
to 1,920.93 after losing 2.71 points Wednesday, also on profit-taking. 
Before Wednesday's downturn, the main index had risen consistently 
since Nov. 20, piling up gains totaling 142.24 points, or 7.8 percent. 
``The market has reached overbought levels, so the correction was 
expected,'' said Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president of Diversified 
Securities Inc. Telecommunication stocks dominated trading after the 
recent buy-in by Hong Kong's First Pacific Co. into Philippine Long 
Distance Telephone Co. The purchase of a controlling interest in PLDT, 
the country's largest telecommunications company, has led to speculation 
that the sector is poised for a further consolidation, with industry 
players merging to fortify their operations. PLDT shares fell 25 pesos, 
or 2.4 percent, to 1,000 pesos, while shares of Metro Pacific, the 
local flagship of First Pacific, dropped 22 centavos, or 10 percent, 
to 1.90 pesos. Garcia said investors also took profits Thursday ahead 
of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and a long weekend, as Philippine 
markets close Monday for a national holiday. Investors were also wary 
of getting caught holding Manila shares when the government releases 
third-quarter economic data Friday, he said. ``People are expecting 
the economic data to be negative, so they sold shares ahead of the 
data's release,'' said Garcia. Economists fear the government may 
report flat growth or another contraction in the economy, which would 
officially put the country in a recession. An economic recession is 
normally defined as two successive quarters of contraction. In the 
second quarter, the country's gross national product contracted by 
0.7 percent, while its gross domestic product declined by 1.2 percent. 
Meanwhile, the peso weakened against the dollar in slack trading as 
participants stayed on the sidelines ahead of the U.S. holiday and 
because of a lack of dollar inflows, traders said. The dollar averaged 
39.462 pesos for the day, up from Wednesday's average of 39.381 pesos. 
It stayed in a thin range of 39.390 pesos to 39.510 pesos and was 
last traded at 39.490 pesos. Traders said a lack of market-moving 
news caused most participants to hold off any currency purchases, 
with many having covered their peso and dollar requirements in previous 
sessions. The central bank wasn't active on the spot market. It held 
its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.500 percent and 15.500 
percent, respectively.
