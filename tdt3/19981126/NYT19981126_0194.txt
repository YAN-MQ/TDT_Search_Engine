Leo Burnett, the adman behind the Marlboro Man, has been selected 
as one of the 20 most influential business leaders of the 20th century. 
In 1935, Burnett started the Chicago agency, still bearing his name, 
that has grown into one of the world's largest. Burnett, who died 
in 1971 at 79, specialized in strong client relationships and building 
brands through the creation of colorful characters _ ``critters'' 
in the parlance of Leo Burnett Co. _ that personify the products they 
peddle, from the rugged Marlboro cowboy to the giddy Pillsbury doughboy 
to the tasteful tuna named Charlie. Burnett is the only advertising 
executive honored by Time magazine in an issue saluting the business 
leaders, the third in a series of six special issues called the Time 
100. Among the Time editors who compiled the list, there were two 
runners-up to Burnett: William Bernbach of Doyle Dane Bernbach and 
David Ogilvy, 87, of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather. The issue _ titled ``Builders 
and Titans'' in the glib Timespeak of tycoons and pundits _ is to 
come out on Monday. A companion television program is scheduled to 
be broadcast by CBS at 10 p.m. ET and PT on Wednesday. Among the other 
honorees are two whose firms are today clients of the Burnett agency: 
Walt Disney of Walt Disney Co. and Ray Kroc of McDonald's Corp. The 
list also includes Henry Ford; Bill Gates of Microsoft Corp.; the 
cosmetics queen Estee Lauder, the only woman, and Akio Morita of Sony 
Corp.. ``You can't look at the 20th century without looking at advertising,'' 
said Walter Isaacson, managing editor of Time, the news weekly published 
by the Time Inc. division of Time Warner Inc. in New York. ``Advertising 
has affected our lives,'' he added, ``and made us the type of consumer 
society we are.'' Bill Saporito, a senior editor at Time who is business 
editor, agreed. ``The economy is two-thirds consumer spending,'' Saporito 
said, and if ``one component of consumerism is an informed consumer,'' 
advertising is important in ``giving the consumer information from 
which to make choices.'' ``Is Charlie the Tuna that voice of information?'' 
he asked, chuckling. ``Not always. But clearly, advertising is a driver.'' 
The selections of Burnett and the other business leaders were made 
by a Time team that included Isaacson, Saporito and Stephen Koepp, 
an executive editor, in consultation with advertising industry executives 
and journalists. One agency executive polled was Patrick Fallon, chairman 
of Fallon McElligott, the Minneapolis shop handling the Time account. 
``Leo Burnett, David Ogilvy and Bill Bernbach are what most of us 
in this business would consider the Big Three,'' Fallon said. ``But 
when they asked my opinion, I said there's no comparison: It's one 
person _ Bill Bernbach, who for me personally changed the face of 
advertising.'' Saporito said: ``It was a really close call. There 
was a really fierce group of Bernbach loyalists, and we heard from 
them.'' ``At the end of the day,'' he added, ``what people associate 
advertising with in a television age is the types of images associated 
with Leo Burnett. So he gets the nod.'' In an essay in the issue, 
Stuart Ewen, chairman of film and media studies at Hunter College 
in New York, writes that Burnett ``built his reputation around the 
idea that `share of market' could be built only on `share of mind,' 
the capacity to stimulate consumers' basic desires and beliefs.'' 
And the primary Burnett method for achieving that, Ewen writes, was 
through characters like the Marlboro Man, ``for better or worse one 
of the most enduring advertising icons ever devised,'' selling Marlboro 
cigarettes for Philip Morris Cos.; Charlie, for Star-Kist tuna; Tony 
the Tiger, for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, and the Jolly Green Giant, 
for Green Giant vegetables. The essay also discusses the significant 
shifts in advertising since the heyday of Burnett. ``Though Burnett's 
talismans endure, they occupy a world where consumers are increasingly 
caustic about the products that they purchase,'' Ewen writes. ``The 
effort by marketers to capitalize on the cynical mindset of an MTV 
generation has overwhelmed the quest for universal human archetypes.'' 
A small article accompanying the Burnett essay discusses Bernbach, 
a co-founder of Doyle Dane, now part of the DDB Needham Worldwide 
unit of Omnicom Group, and Ogilvy, whose agency, now known as Ogilvy 
&AMP; Mather Worldwide, is owned by WPP Group PLC. The article praises 
Bernbach, who died in 1982, for leading ``a velvet revolution in advertising'' 
in the 1960s, ``relying on creativity, sly humor and instinct.'' Doyle 
Dane work included the famous ``Think small'' campaign for the original 
Volkswagen Beetle, the ``We try harder'' ads for Avis and the ``Hey, 
Mikey!'' commercial for Life cereal. The article compliments Ogilvy 
for working for only those clients ``whose products he felt were beyond 
reproach'' and creating such enduring brand imagery as the dapper 
``Man in the Hathaway shirt,'' always sporting an eyepatch, and the 
bearded Commander Schweppes, the veddy British spokesman for Schweppes 
mixers. Another reason that Burnett prevailed over Bernbach and Ogilvy 
may be that he is one of the few founders of modern Madison Avenue 
with a distinctive identity. His agency continues to promote the red 
apples he set out in bowls at the office, his black copy pencils and 
his sayings like ``Reach for the stars.'' ``Leo Burnett has always 
been a titan in our eyes,'' said Richard Fizdale, chairman and chief 
executive at the Burnett agency. ``You cannot work here for any length 
of time and not come into contact with him.'' What Fizdale described 
as the ``tiny eight-person shop'' that Burnett began now ranks No. 
13 among the world's agencies, with estimated billings of $6 billion 
from clients like Disney, McDonald's, Coca-Cola Co., Kellogg Co. and 
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.. The timing of the Time selection is serendipitous 
for the agency. After difficulties with lost accounts and turmoil 
among top executives in 1996 and 1997, there has been a rebound in 
recent months that included new assignments from P&AMP;G, Diageo PLC, 
H.J. Heinz Co. and Sara Lee Corp.
