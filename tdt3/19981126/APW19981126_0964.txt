Chile's former dictator broke into tears upon learning he faces the 
threat of extradition to Spain on charges of genocide, torture and 
terrorism, Spanish newspapers reported Thursday. Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
was read the news Wednesday _ his 83rd birthday _ at the London hospital 
where he is under police guard, minutes before Britain's highest court 
upheld his detention and ruled he did not have immunity from prosecution. 
The man allegedly responsible for killing and torturing thousands 
during his 13-year rule, put his head in his hands and sobbed, leading 
daily El Pais reported, citing unidentified sources close to the case. 
But Jose Luis Morales, an official at the Chilean Embassy in London, 
was quoted by the Santiago afternoon daily La Hora as flatly denying 
that Pinochet cried. The paper cited Morales as saying by telephone 
that he was the one who broke the news to Pinochet and that ``he reacted 
with disappointment but with calm.'' El Pais said a British woman 
official had read out the ruling to Pinochet. Two other Spanish papers 
also reported that Pinochet had cried. British Home Secretary Jack 
Straw asked to extend by one week the original Wednesday deadline 
to decide whether to allow extradition proceedings to continue, his 
office announced Thursday. Pinochet is due to appear Wednesday at 
a London court, required of all facing extradition. Spanish jurists 
believe that a final decision on extradition could take a year. In 
the meantime, Judge Baltasar Garzon, who instigated the case, may 
travel to London to question the former dictator. A Chilean government 
report says 3,000 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands 
of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship, which began in 
1973 when he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. Allende 
died in the coup. Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza will 
head a delegation this week to press Britain to release Pinochet, 
who was arrested Oct. 16 in London. Chilean President Eduardo Frei 
complained that the affair violates Chile's sovereignty, and endangers 
the country's fragile transition to democracy, which began when Pinochet 
stepped down in 1990. News of the ruling was greeted with anger by 
Pinochet's supporters in Chile who attacked journalists in Santiago, 
including a television crew from the British Broadcasting Corporation. 
The Pinochet Foundation said it lamented the mistreatment of journalists 
at its headquarters in Santiago. But the threat of extradition to 
Spain has convinced Pinochet's opponents at home that a trial could 
be possible _ even in his native Chile. ``The trial of Pinochet in 
Chile is no longer a shot into the air or a mad dream,'' Chilean lawyer 
Eduardo Contreras told reporters in Madrid. In January, Contreras 
helped file a suit in Chile against Pinochet for mass murder, kidnapping 
and illegal burying of bodies. Until recently the case was thought 
doomed. ``With time the impact of the (British) lords' decision on 
Chilean public opinion could lead the (Chilean) courts to strip Pinochet 
of his immunity and allow him to be tried,'' he said. Contreras says 
that Pinochet has been irreparably damaged _ even if Britain lets 
him return home. ``He would go back as human trash, as a broken general, 
as a general who cries,'' the lawyer said.
