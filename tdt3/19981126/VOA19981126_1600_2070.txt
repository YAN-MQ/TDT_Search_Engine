Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
or OPEC have decided not to change production quotas despite a continuing 
slump in world oil prices. Correspondent Art Chimes is following the 
story from our regional news bureau in Prague. The OPEC News Agency 
says the ministers reviewed the market situation at their meeting 
in Vienna, but deferred any action until their next meeting in March. 
OPEC officially describes oil prices as unacceptable, which is something 
of an understatement for the producers cartel. Oil prices have been 
in a steady decline this year, with many grades trading in the $10 
per barrel range. Adjusted for inflation, it means oil prices are 
as low as they have been in decades. And some analysts say that prices 
could drop even more as production continues to outpace demand. OPEC 
members agreed in June on a 10 percent production cut. But even so, 
there is still too much oil for the market to absorb. Economic crisis 
in Asia has cut demand for oil there by about half. Art Chimes, VOA 
News, Prague.
