Turkey's sports minister has invited his Italian counterpart to attend 
the Galatasaray-Juventus Champions League match set for Wednesday 
in Istanbul _ a politically charged offer at a time of tensions between 
the two nations. Sports Minister Yucel Seckiner sent an invitation 
to Giovanna Melandri on Wednesday. ``We invited the minister to see 
that there is no negative atmosphere in Turkey,'' said Ahmet Gocen, 
a sports ministry official. UEFA postponed the match _ it was to have 
been played Wednesday _ and set it for next Wednesday because of anti-Italian 
sentiment in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel 
leader Abdullah Ocalan. Turkish and Galatasaray officials said the 
decision favored the Italian team. Some claimed soccer's European 
governing body had postponed the match to allow injured Juventus players 
time to get back into shape. Melandri said Thursday she appreciated 
Turkey's invitation personally. She didn't say whether she would accept, 
saying, ``that should be a decision for the government as a whole 
to consider.'' The Turkish side has 7 points in Group B, one behind 
Norway's Rosenborg. Galatasaray has seven and Juventus four, but they've 
each played one fewer game than the Norwegians. Juventus has reached 
the European Champions Cup final three straight times and won once. 
Thousands of Turks have taken to the streets in the past week in anti-Italian 
demonstrations since Ocalan's detention in Rome earlier this month. 
Italy has since released the rebel leader and is considering granting 
him political asylum.
