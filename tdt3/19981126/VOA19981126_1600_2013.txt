British Prime Minister Tony Blair says his nation and Ireland must 
not become prisoners of history, by letting the chance for lasting 
peace slip away. Mr. Blair told Irish lawmakers he is optimistic peace 
will prevail despite the current deadlock over paramilitary disarmament 
in Northern Ireland. Progress is being made but slowly. There is an 
empasse of the establishment of the executive, there is an empasse 
over decommissioning. But I have been optimistic the whole way through. 
And I am optimistic now. It was the first address to the Irish Parliament 
by a British leader since Ireland won independence from Great Britain 
76 years ago.
