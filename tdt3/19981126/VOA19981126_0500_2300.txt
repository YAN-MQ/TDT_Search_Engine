Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, delivers an address to the Irish 
Parliament in Dublin in a few hours. The first by a British Prime 
Minister since Irish independence in 1922. And the streets expected 
about two in a half hours from now, Mr. Blair is to call for the two 
countries to put passed animosities behind them and new era of good 
will and cooperation. He is also expected to offer an optimistic assessment 
of prospects for peace in Northern Ireland.
