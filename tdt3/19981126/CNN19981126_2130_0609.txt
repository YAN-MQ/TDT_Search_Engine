Two years ago, only 8% of retailers had sales sites on the Internet. 
Now more than 25% of them do. In this edition of "tech trends," Marsha 
Walton takes a look at the risks involved in doing holiday shopping 
online. I do all sorts of orders on the phone line, but I won't do 
it online. And maybe I'll change, but right now, I just kind of -- 
I know it's stupid, but I just don't trust it yet. While some consumers 
may still be skittish about making purchases online, most people have 
a good experience, and electronic commerce is booming. We're moving 
to a place where as much as 50% of all of our purchases will be done 
over the Internet over the next five years. There is really very little 
fraud that takes place. Internet shopping sites, like buy.com, encrypt 
or scramble credit card information. Executives there say, like any 
new technology, it will take time for consumers to gain confidence. 
I think a lot of people in the initial days with an ATM were afraid 
to use the ATM, they wanted to go in and talk to a teller. And I think 
it's really just people becoming comfortable using their credit card 
online. Experts say shoppers should stick with brands they know and 
with companies with established reputations. Take the time to comparison 
shop, and be certain of the total price, shipping costs, return and 
cancellation policies. Beware of offers from unsolicited E-mail, or 
spam. It's a tool often used by crooks. And don't judge reliability 
by how nice or flashy a web site may seem. Anybody can create one. 
Some online Sellers, like Barnes & Noble.com, are so confident of 
their security, they'll pick up the tab if there's a problem. If anything 
was ever to go wrong -- and it never has in 18 months -- we would 
stand behind it and cover that customer on any transaction. And while 
some folks delight in the hustle and bustle of holiday shopping, more 
and more are grateful for the solitude of whittling away at that gift 
list at 2:00 A.M. at home in their pajamas. Marsha Walton, CNN, Atlanta.
