Thanksgiving has been coming to this country for about 20 years now 
and still can't fathom the point of it all. THE WORLD's Boris Maksimov. 
Other holidays are fine. Take Christmas, for example. You get presents. 
And if you're even vaguely Christian, you have a reason to celebrate 
to boot. Easter, Independence Day, these are all pretty normal things, 
pretty normal nations celebrate. But Thanks "bloody" giving? First 
of all, the word itself is untranslatable into any known language 
except maybe Klingon and that is never a good sign. I mean, it is, 
OK, for a nation suddenly to decide to be mysterious to foreigners, 
but usually, it takes some slightly dignified form. Russians keep 
on mumbling about the imponderable nature of their souls. They Chinese 
keep mentioning the inconceivable age of their civilization. The Egyptians 
point at the pyramids at the Sphinx, and that's the case. But the 
Americans? Why has the entire nation decided to gather around an ungainly 
looking bird covered in a red goo derived from cranberries? What can 
that mean? What is the point? Why would anyone who is not an ethnic 
Kurd get excited about carving up turkey? And what is so particularly 
good about finally reuniting with your long lost relatives? Relatives 
are best kept in ocean or at least a continent away. Isn't that why 
so many Americans from the East Coast move to California? And yet, 
today millions of people are staring at their plates, pondering two 
age-old questions: Why did God invent turkey? And now that I've said 
hello to the family, what are we going to talk about for the rest 
of the evening? If you think I'm exaggerating, consider this. You 
are now listening to me instead of your relatives.
