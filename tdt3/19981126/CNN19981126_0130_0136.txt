Dr. Jack Kevorkian is free on bond after being arraigned on murder 
charges wednesday. Prosecutors in Michigan filed the charges after 
watching a videotape of kevorkian administering a deadly chemical 
to a terminally ill man. Portions of the tape, provided by Kevorkian, 
aired on "60 minutes." Kevorkian promised the magistrate who released 
him he would not aid in a Death or suicide. He will return to court 
for a preliminary hearing December 9th. Prosecutors say they had no 
choice but to charge Kevorkian with breaking michigan's assisted suicide 
law. Notwithstanding public sentiment on the issue of assisted suicide, 
it's incumbent upon me to make charging decisions solely on the law 
and not emotion or sympathy. In Chris case, there is an obvious violation 
of the law that I will not turn my back to. Kevorkian was charged 
with first-degree murder, criminal assistance to a Suicide and delivery 
of a controlled substance. He claims to have participated in 130 assisted 
suicides since 1990.
