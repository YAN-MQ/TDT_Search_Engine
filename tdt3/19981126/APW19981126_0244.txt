Two propane gas canisters exploded on Thursday at the private office 
of Greece's justice minister, police said. A security guard who tried 
to extinguish the fire was slightly injured. Police said there was 
minor damage caused to minister Evangelos Giannopoulos' office located 
in downtown Athens. There was no warning call prior to the explosion. 
No group has claimed responsibility so far, police said. The attack 
was similar to more than 200 other blasts this year, including one 
earlier this month at a government labor office. Most have been claimed 
by obscure leftist groups and have targeted cars, government offices, 
policemen and foreign businesses.
