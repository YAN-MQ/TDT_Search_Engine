No holiday for the merger mavens on Wall Street. For more on that 
story, we go to Tony Guida at the CNN Financial Newsdesk in New York. 
Hi, Tony. Hi, holly. The big are getting bigger. According to published 
reports, oil giant Exxon is close to buying rival mobil oil in what 
would be the largest industrial merger ever. Sources close to the 
negotiations say that a formal announcement could come as early as 
next week. Mobil has long been a rumored takeover target, as industry 
rapidly consolidates amid a worldwide glut of oil. The price is low. 
And it's going to remain low. At least that's the perception of the 
oil industry. Therefore, in such a case, big is better, because you 
need more power to discover oil and you need more strength and am 
koe bp has shown the way. No price has been set yet, but the deal 
would probably be the largest merger ever.
