The last manned lighthouse in Britain was switched to computer controls 
Thursday, completing a 15-year effort to make lighthouse keepers obsolete. 
``Change is one of those things that you think is marvelous for other 
people but is never quite as pleasant for yourself or for other people 
you are responsible for,'' Prince Philip told the six men who had 
tended the North Foreland lighthouse on the English Channel coast 
in Kent. The tower was built in 1691, and there has been a lighthouse 
on the site since 1499. Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, 
is master of the Trinity House Lighthouse Service, which has spent 
15 years and nearly 3 million pounds (dlrs 5 million) automating the 
nation's 72 towers. Dermot Cronin, a lighthouse keeper for 33 years 
and the senior keeper at North Foreland, said it was a sad day. ``It 
is not just the end of a job -- it's the end of a way of life. I always 
wanted to be a lighthouse keeper, ever since the age of 16. I like 
the freedom,'' said Cronin. His job required him to be at the lighthouse 
continuously for a month at a time. He spent alternate months at home 
in Dublin, Ireland, with his family. Keepers worked in groups of three 
for 12-hour shifts. ``People think you have got to be a bit of a loner 
to be a keeper, but in reality you have got to get on with people 
as you are stuck with them for long periods of time,'' Cronin said. 
``You have to have a hobby because there is a lot of waiting around.''
