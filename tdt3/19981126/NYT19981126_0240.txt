Perhaps Leon Hess knows something. The 84-year-old owner of the New 
York Jets paid his annual Thanksgiving Day visit to practice Thursday, 
and for a change he is allowing himself to think of the possibilities. 
How close is this team to a Super Bowl? ``I dream about it all the 
time,'' Hess said. There have been times when even dreaming was too 
much to bear. Even in 1986, when the team started 10-1. Hess was asked 
then for a comment about the success. ``I'd rather not,'' he said. 
``My heart's been broken too many times.'' The Jets went on to lose 
their final five games. Through the good times and the bad times, 
though, Hess has kept ticket prices down. The Jets are traditionally 
the lowest-priced seat in the National Football League. Even though 
the games have been sold out since the team moved to the Meadowlands 
in 1984, the Jets consistently led the league in no-shows. But now 
every home crowd this season has topped 70,000. ``It's a heck of a 
lot better than 30,000 or 40,000 no-shows,'' Hess said Thursday. In 
1963, Hess was one of five partners who rescued the Titans from bankruptcy 
court for $1 million and then created the Jets from a mountain of 
paper debt. He bought out his last partner in 1984, and became the 
sole owner of a team, which is probably now worth $250 million. His 
retiring style as owner masks a steely resolve that marks his dealings 
in the oil business, in which he is a major international figure. 
Hess stepped down only two years ago as the day-to-day head of Amerada 
Hess Corp., but is still in the office daily. He has dealt personally 
with Col. Moammar Gadhafi and officials of the Arab Emirates, as well 
as heads of Caribbean countries. But Hess has left the running of 
the Jets to others and seldom attends practices once the season starts. 
He will, however, usually wish the players well in the locker room 
before games. Afterward, he stands quietly off to the side with several 
friends while the players get dressed. Hess started to attend Thanksgiving 
practice in 1977. He has not missed one. And Thursday, as he has every 
year on this day except once, he also addressed the team. Speaking 
inside the practice bubble during a halt in the workout, Hess singled 
out coach Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick, his chief assistant, to 
the players. ``I've never seen him so animated,'' tight end Kyle Brady 
said. Then again, Hess has not seen his team tied for first at this 
time of season very often. He knows that if the Jets win their final 
five games, starting Sunday with the Carolina Panthers at the Meadowlands, 
they will capture the American Conference East Division. No wonder 
he told the players in his perpetually husky voice Thursday: ``It's 
a five-game season.'' ``He told us to be thankful for Bill Parcells,'' 
said center Kevin Mawae, who added, ``Parcells was beet red.'' That 
pleased Mawae, who does not see his coach in an embarrassing position 
very often. ``I hope Parcells doesn't believe everything he said,'' 
Mawae said. Later, in an interview _ Hess has held only three formal 
news conferences in his 35-year association with the team _ he was 
animated and hopeful. ``We have wonderful coaches, a wonderful spirit 
with the team,'' he said. ``We may have a setback from time to time, 
but we'll come back. I hope that we do very well.'' So Hess is enjoying 
what is happening this season? ``I enjoy it a hell of a lot more than 
1-15,'' he said, reflecting on the 1996 record that led to the arrival 
of Parcells. Still, his memory is long enough that he tempers his 
excitement now. ``I'm cautiously optimistic and I stop there,'' Hess 
said. ``It's a heck of a letdown when it goes bad.'' Even though he 
may dream about the Super Bowl _ he was there once, 30 seasons ago 
_ he is reluctant to predict how far this club can go. ``We'll let 
the coach do the talking,'' Hess said. ``He's the boss. The whole 
team is his, as if he owned it. And it's his decision on what happens.'' 
Parcells has described Hess as an owner who ``doesn't say too much.'' 
``It was always pretty much encouraging,'' Parcells added. ``Very 
thoughtful. He's very supportive.'' When they first talked about Parcells' 
taking over the team, Hess was very accommodating. ``He just told 
me, `What do you need?' He's one of those guys you don't need anything 
written down,'' Parcells said. Parcells was 9-7 in his first season, 
and he is poised for the playoffs in his second, but he refused to 
speculate whether Hess is more upbeat in this winning season. ``I 
don't have a point of reference,'' the coach said. Then he returned 
to his point of reference. ``It hasn't been that enjoyable for me: 
9-7, 7-4,'' he said. EXTRA POINTS _ BILL PARCELLS is going to pay 
the team's $10,000 fine that was levied by the league. The Jets did 
not open the locker room to the news media after Sunday's victory 
at Nashville. ``I'm going to pay it myself,'' Parcells said. ``I understand 
what the league policy is and I was in no way trying not to make the 
media access available. I thought I made a prudent decision for my 
team. It's not like the five other teams that played there earlier. 
I've got 40 guys in the media. Some teams had eight writers with them. 
I just did what was best for my team.'' He was also fined $10,000 
by the league last year for failing to disclose a late-week injury 
to center ROGER DUFFY. _ Parcells would not comment on BRYAN COX's 
charges of league racism involving the player's $10,000 fine for unnecessary 
roughness against the Tennessee Oilers.
