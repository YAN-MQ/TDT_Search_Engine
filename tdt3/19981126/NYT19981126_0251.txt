Valentin Berezhkov, a Russian who interpreted for Stalin and Molotov 
at conferences that they, Roosevelt and Churchill attended during 
World War II, died Nov. 20 at his home in Claremont, Calif. He was 
82. At his death he was the Diane and Guilford Glazer distinguished 
visiting professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles. ``I have 
had the good fortune to be witness to some of the events that have 
helped shape our century,'' Berezhkov wrote in his volume of memoirs, 
``At Stalin's Side: His Interpreter's Memoirs from the October Revolution 
to the Fall of the Dictator's Empire'' (1994, Carol). He was also 
a Soviet diplomat and a journalist during the Soviet era. But in 1991, 
with the Soviet system disintegrating, he and his wife Valeria moved 
to Claremont. He went on to teach at Pomona, Pitzer and Harvey Mudd 
Colleges, all in California, before going to Occidental. The subjects 
he taught included World War II and the Cold War. He also lectured 
widely about Russia and about Russian-American relations. In his book 
Berezhkov, a tall, strapping man with flowing white hair, recorded 
his impression of Stalin when he first saw him, late in 1941 in Moscow. 
At that time Berezhkov was a promising young interpreter. He had been 
picked to work for Stalin, who was meeting with a British-American 
delegation. ``When I took a look at him, I felt a shock,'' Berezhkov 
wrote. ``He was completely unlike the image of Stalin I had formed 
in my mind. He was short and haggard, his tired face, covered with 
smallpox scars, was the color of the earth. His uniform hung loosely 
on his lean frame.'' Berezhkov also recalled: ``Stalin always treated 
me in the same, even indifferent, manner. Sometimes it seemed to me 
that he was looking right through me.'' But he described Stalin's 
fury after he was kept awake by a blind peasant's barking dog: He 
ordered a guard to kill the dog, saying that if the guard failed to 
do so, ``I will order you killed, too.'' In an interview after the 
book came out, Berezhkov recalled that sometimes Stalin would ask 
a nervous subordinate suspiciously: ``Why don't you look me in the 
eye? What are you afraid of? Why are your eyes shifting around?'' 
Berezhkov also wrote that just before Stalin met with Roosevelt at 
the Tehran Conference in 1943, the Soviet leader paid careful attention 
to the placing of the furniture, and ``It occurred to me he might 
be nervous before his meeting with Roosevelt.'' But when the two leaders 
got together, he recalled, ``They asked about each other's health, 
spoke about the harm of smoking and the benefits of fresh air. It 
was beginning to look like a meeting of old pals.'' At the conference, 
attended also by Churchill, agreement was achieved about the extent 
and scheduling of military operations against Germany. Berezhkov was 
born in St. Petersburg, studied English and German and received an 
engineering degree in 1938 from the University of Kiev. After serving 
in the Soviet navy he went on to become an aide to Molotov, the Soviet 
foreign minister, and an official of the Soviet Embassy in Berlin 
in the period leading up to the German invasion of the Soviet Union 
in 1941. Late in 1940 he accompanied Molotov to Hitler's office in 
Berlin and shook hands with Hitler. ``His palm was cold and damp,'' 
he wrote in the book, ``giving me an unpleasant sensation, as if I 
were touching a reptile.'' After the war Berezhkov became a journalist 
in the Soviet Union and rose to be a high editor of the foreign affairs 
weekly New Times and of the journal U.S.A. Economics, Politics and 
Ideology. In 1974 he received a doctorate in international relations 
from the Soviet Academy of Science in Moscow. From 1978 to 1983 he 
was a high official of the Soviet Embassy in Washington. Berezhkov's 
1940 marriage to his first wife, Galina, ended in divorce. Besides 
his second wife, Valeria, whom he married in 1966, he is survived 
by two sons, both of Moscow: Sergei _ who interprets for President 
Boris Yeltsin and for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia _ 
and Alexei; and five grandchildren.
