In this country, in the pacific northwest, a strong wind storm has 
caused havoc. Winds of more than 100 miles an hour turned over cars, 
closed roads and collapsed buildings. That same storm knocked out 
power at an oil refinery. There was a massive explosion. Six were 
killed. Investigators say it could take weeks to determine what caused 
the accident.
