Calling it a special moment in the history of their franchise, Major 
League Baseball's Anaheim Angels have signed first baseman Mo Vaughn 
to a six-year free agent contract. The deal will pay the 30-year-old 
three time All-star, $80 million. Vaughn's new contract works out 
to 13 and 1/3 million dollars a year, and makes him baseball's highest 
paid player. Vaughn says the Angels treated him with the respect that 
he wanted. The way the Angels are come forth in this deal as professionals 
and as people, they bargained in good faith, and really showed me 
that they wanted me, not just by the package that they set up in terms 
of money, but just about how they went about that process. And I haven't 
been used to that too much, you know, going through what I've been 
going through here. The 1995 American League Most Valuable Player 
went to Anaheim after rejecting a five year, $60 million offer from 
his former team, the Boston Red Socks.
