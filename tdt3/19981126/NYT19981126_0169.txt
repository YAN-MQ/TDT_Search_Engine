Treasure hunter Mel Fisher has admitted selling several counterfeit 
gold coins at his gift shop here and has agreed to repay customers 
their purchase prices of $2,500 to $10,000. In a negotiated plea, 
Fisher's company also agreed that in the future it would sell only 
coins recovered from shipwrecks for which it has federal salvage rights. 
The coins in question were said to have been purchased from a longtime 
colleague who had contended that they were genuine. The agreement, 
signed Nov. 18, tarnished a career in which Fisher found hundreds 
of thousands of gold and silver coins, bars and jewelry from Spanish 
shipwrecks off Florida. He and several investors became millionaires 
from a haul valued at more than $400 million. Fisher, whose office 
was raided by police in April, is near death from cancer, said a lawyer, 
Michael Halpern, who negotiated the plea for Crystals of Delaware, 
Fisher's retail sales subsidiary. Halpern said he believed Fisher's 
illness contributed to the fraud. ``He was taking immense amounts 
of medicine,'' Halpern said. ``He is very, very vulnerable.'' Fisher's 
son, Kim, who is running the company, signed the plea bargain for 
his father. Under the agreement, Crystals pleaded no contest but acknowledged 
that the coins were not from a 1733 Spanish fleet that went aground 
near the Florida Keys. In addition to the more than $67,000 to be 
paid to identified claimants, the company agreed to maintain a $50,000 
restitution fund for any additional customers who demand refunds during 
the three-year probation period. Paul Myers, an investigator for the 
Monroe County state's attorney's office, said he found indications 
that as many as 1,000 counterfeit counts bearing a 1733 fleet insignia 
were forged over the last 25 years and may have been sold by other 
dealers. Fisher bought the coins from Walter Kruse, a longtime treasure-hunting 
associate with a criminal record of selling fake coins, according 
to Myers. Fisher sold the coins with a signed certificate stating 
that he had found them. Halpern said the agreement to sell only coins 
from Fisher's six Florida shipwreck sites protects both customers 
and Fisher's reputation. Under federal salvage law, found treasure 
is presented to a federal judge who certifies authenticity and title 
and insures that archaeological rules were followed. Fisher spent 
18 years looking for the Atocha, which he found in 1985 in the ocean 
off Key West. His success at finding treasure and at winning title 
under traditional admiralty law galvanized archaeologists, historians 
and environmentalists, who persuaded states and Congress to control 
salvage, beginning in 1987.
