A new film is slamming its way into theaters. Janine sharell reports 
on the movie and the poetry that is "slam." "slam" -- it's an art 
form, a marriage of poetry and rap, laced with raw emotion, giving 
voice to inner feelings, thoughts. I feel like my back is against 
a brick wall and I got a Mac truck two inches from my face. Every 
cell of my body is screaming run. "slam," the film, is a Cannes and 
sundance film festival winner. I'm kicking and stomping and running 
and jumping, wreaking all kinds of havoc, creating a bloody mess and 
I am going nowhere. The movie focuses largely on two characters, an 
inspirational, creative writing teacher played by Sonja Sohn. Never 
give anyone the power to take away your freedom. And a man doing time 
for marijuana possession, played by real-life, award-winning slam 
poet saul Williams. Give me the strength to bend back these bars. 
Got the locks of samson, I'm samson! I wanted the film to be much 
more poetic than it is, and it's extremely poetic now. But I wanted 
a poetic narrative, and I wanted the film to be titled, "Ray of the 
sun." And they were like, "no, marketing research shows that a one-title 
thing does this, that and the other." But I was like, "ah, marketing 
research. Soul search, that's what we do." "Slam" is an energy. And 
that's what it is, it's a slam. It's a -- you know, on every level, 
you know what I mean? Physically, intellectually, spiritually, emotionally. 
Oh, with the jail, being the slammer and with poetry slams also, it's 
a Very poetic title. I'm standing on the corner of the block slingin' 
amythest rocks, dodgin' cops there's an mc in the band Both Sohn and 
Williams have co-writing credits for the film. Each penned their own 
poems and each has taken part in nights like this one in the Hollywood 
theater district. We workshopped it for nine months and decided early 
on in the process not to write down any of the dialogue. Mark Levin, 
the director, was very smart in casting poets/actors as his contributors 
so that he trusted our use of language. And, as poets, we trust our 
use of language. So that, yes, we did the improv, but we were very 
prepared. The fruit of their preparation, "slam," is now playing in 
limited release. Janine sharell, CNN, Los Angeles.
