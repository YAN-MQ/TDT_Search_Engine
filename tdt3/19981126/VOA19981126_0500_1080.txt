American Pete Sampras has clinched a spot in the ATP World Championship 
Semi Finals and have moved closer to clinching the world number one 
ranking for a record sixth straight year. The top seeded Sampras defeated 
fourth seat Carlos Moya of Spain 6-3, 6-3 Wednesday at the lucrative 
year-ending event at Yanover, Germany. Sampras said he served and 
volleyed well to put Moia under a lot of pressure. Earlier in the 
day, number five Alex Karetcha of Spain beat third seat, Andre Agassi 
after the American withdraw from the match with back strain. Karetcha 
was leading 5-7, 6-3, 2-1 when the Agassi withdrew. Agassi said his 
back hurt during warmups and got worse during the match. I hit swinging 
volley, I think like at 2-0 in the first set and when I twisted, it 
just like somebody stuck a knife in me and as the match progressed, 
more things were becoming difficult and um pretty soon it got quite 
pointless. The injury has forced Agassi to withdraw from the tournament 
and Greg Ruzedsky of England will replace him in the group.
