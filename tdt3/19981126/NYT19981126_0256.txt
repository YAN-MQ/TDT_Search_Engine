Whether it was prayers or detectives that finally flushed the thief, 
no one can say. But two days after an amulet said to contain a sliver 
of bone from St. Jude vanished from a Roman Catholic church in Brooklyn, 
it was back home Thursday. A local resident found the amulet near 
a park bench outside the Bayview Houses shortly before noon on Thanksgiving 
Day, the police said. The resident, the police added, then took it 
back to St. Jude Roman Catholic Church in Canarsie, where it has rested 
since the parish was established 37 years ago. ``St. Jude is our patron 
saint, the patron of hopeless causes and difficult cases,'' said the 
Rev. Matteo Rizzo, the parish priest. ``I can't help but think he 
was guiding or directing things to make sure the amulet came back 
to us safely.'' Rizzo said he believed that the amulet, which has 
the relic hanging inside from a cloth cross, had been stolen sometime 
Tuesday night. It was discovered missing on Wednesday morning by workers 
preparing for a children's Mass, and detectives from the 69th Precinct 
were dispatched to investigate. As they worked around the clock interviewing 
churchgoers and neighbors, Rizzo put out the word that no questions 
would be asked if the amulet miraculously reappeared. Lt. Joseph Cardinale, 
head of the 69th Precinct detective squad and a former parishioner 
at the church, said it was unclear why anyone would steal the polished 
brass encasement, noting that it had virtually no material value. 
He said detectives speculated that someone had mistaken it for gold. 
``We think the people who took it were juveniles with nothing better 
to do,'' Cardinale said. ``Because it was locked up, they felt it 
had value.'' The man who found and returned the amulet was not a suspect, 
Cardinale said, adding that the man had asked that his name not be 
released. The amulet is now locked in the church rectory, where it 
will remain until protective wrought iron can be installed around 
its case, Rizzo said before blessing his Thanksgiving dinner. He added 
that nothing had ever been stolen from the church before, although 
there was evidence that a few weeks ago someone tried to force open 
a collection box. ``It's sad,'' he said, ``that people are so troubled 
or desperate that they would come into a house of worship and commit 
such an act of desecration, but maybe their conscience did finally 
bother them. I'm just glad St. Jude has heard our prayers. Thank God.''
