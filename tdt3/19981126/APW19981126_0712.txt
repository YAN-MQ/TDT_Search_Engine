President Ernesto Zedillo's 1999 budget proposal sounds like an invitation 
to political suicide. It raises gasoline prices by 15 percent. It 
introduces a 15-percent tax on phone services and lets states add 
2 percent on top of an existing 15-percent federal sales tax. And 
it includes a dlrs 55 billion bank bailout most Mexicans see as benefiting 
wealthy bankers. ``Mexicans are being made to pay for what others 
have pocketed,'' said congressman Luis Patino of the opposition Labor 
Party. Some lawmakers are parodying Zedillo's 1994 campaign slogan, 
``well-being for families,'' calling his proposal ``ill-being for 
families.'' Analysts say the slogan could become Zedillo's version 
of ``Read my Lips'' _ a promise of no new taxes that former U.S. President 
George Bush's made then violated. They say it could help Mexico's 
governing party lose its 69-year grip on power in the 2000 presidential 
elections. ``It could lead to a political crisis of grave consequences,'' 
said Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst with the elite Colegio de 
Mexico thinktank. Mexico's Congress has until Dec. 15 to approve or 
reject Zedillo's budget proposal. It also could pass a modified version, 
which the president would not have the authority to veto. Zedillo 
says the new taxes are needed to help pay for the bank bailout, and 
because of the worldwide drop in oil prices, which is costing Mexico 
_ an oil exporter _ billions of dollars in lost revenues. It's the 
first time in recent Mexican history that a president's budget proposal 
faces widespread criticism from business leaders, the Roman Catholic 
church, economists and lawmakers _ even those from his own Institutional 
Revolutionary Party. Business groups that have long acted as government 
allies have dropped their support. The Entrepreneurial Coordinating 
Council and the Mexican Employers' Confederation called the proposed 
budget an affront. And dissent also is growing even within the ruling 
party, known as the PRI. Mexican labor unions, long controlled by 
the PRI, are calling for a 22-percent raise in the minimum wage, currently 
about dlrs 3 a day. The government has offered only 13 percent. ``The 
13 percent increase has already been eaten away by the 15 percent 
gasoline hike and other increases. Even 22 percent would not be enough 
to restore purchasing power,'' said PRI congressman Efren Enriques. 
In its current issue, the weekly Milenio magazine interviewed 50 clergymen 
from throughout the country, all of whom harshly criticized the government's 
economic policy. ``It seems the authorities are suffering from blindness,'' 
said Roman Catholic Archbishop Bartolome Carrasco. ``It is evident 
they do not see or feel the people's suffering, and they don't want 
to.'' Mexico's two main rebel groups are hoping that the discontent 
will translate into more support for them. Subcomandante Marcos, leader 
of the Zapatista rebels in southern Chiapas state, denounced Zedillo's 
budget on Sunday. The Popular Revolutionary Army issued a statement 
Wednesday night saying the government ``is killing people with bullets 
of hunger and misery,'' and called on those upset with the economy 
to join its ranks. Zedillo also faces a potential minefield in the 
bank bailout he proposed in March, and part of which he included in 
his budget proposal. He wants the government to absorb most of the 
dlrs 55 billion that the banks lost in bad loans in the 1995 economic 
crisis. Opposition leaders say the bailout fund absorbed bad loans 
from wealthy businessmen, some of which have said they made multimillion-dollar 
contributions to the ruling party's campaign that brought Zedillo 
to power. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, chairman of the Democratic 
Revolution Party, challenged Zedillo last week to deny that he received 
millions of dollars in campaign contributions from Carlos Cabal Peniche, 
a fugitive banker recently arrested in Australia. A Zedillo spokeswoman 
said the president has not denied the alleged contributions, which 
are being investigated by the Federal Electoral Institute, Mexico's 
top election authority. ``The issue of Zedillo's campaign spending 
looms on the horizon,'' analyst Aguayo said. ``An investigation could 
lead to a political scandal linking political corruption with the 
economic crisis.''
