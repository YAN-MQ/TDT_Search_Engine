China and Japan have hailed the beginning of a new stage set for their 
relations. Visiting Chinese President Zhang Ze Minh met Thursday with 
Japanese Prime Minister Kasuo Obuchi. The two issued a communique 
agreeing to enhance cooperation. But the two countries failed to emerge 
completely from a shadow from their war-time past. The Chinese failed 
to get Japan to formally apologize for its war-time atrocities. VOA's 
Roger Wilkerson reports, the two leaders will not sign a joint-statement 
wrapping up the talks. Spokesman for both the countries are downplaying 
the fact that the two leaders will not sign the joint statement, saying 
what is important is the statement itself, and not the signatures. 
But the lack of a clear cut apology to China, like the one Japan gave 
to South Korea earlier this month has angered the Chinese. Japanese 
news media are reporting that Mr. Zhang told Mr. Obuchi that final 
Japanese ties can never reach their full potential until Japan acknowledges 
its past wrongs. Japan also failed to satisfy the Chinese on the Taiwan 
issue. Tokyo repeated its previous statements that it recognizes only 
one China, that it understands and respects China's claim to Taiwan, 
and that its own relations with Taiwan are non-official. China wanted 
a stronger pledge from Tokyo, including a promise that Taiwan will 
not fall under the umbrella of the revised Japan-US Security Alliance.
