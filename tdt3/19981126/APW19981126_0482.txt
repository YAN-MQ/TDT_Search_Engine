Iran's president condemned Thursday an Islamic militant attack on 
a bus of American tourists, saying it was a national disgrace. ``The 
ugly, perverse and possibly conspiratorial treatment of foreign tourists, 
and those who are officially visiting Iran with valid visas, was an 
affront to the honor of the Iranian people,'' Tehran radio quoted 
Mohammad Khatami as saying in a speech to Intelligence Ministry officials. 
Radicals chanting ``Death to America'' and wielding iron bars and 
throwing stones smashed the windows of a bus carrying 13 foreigners, 
mostly Americans, in Tehran on Saturday. Hardline newspapers had accused 
the tourists of being spies. On Monday, U.S. officials in Washington 
denied that any of the Americans were government officials or had 
links to the CIA. The group left the country early Sunday. The president 
said the assault was ``an insult to the government and an intolerable 
act,'' the radio reported. Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh 
had earlier condemned the attack as ``unacceptable,'' saying that 
anybody who entered Iran legally was entitled to protection. The Fedayeen 
Islam, a radical Muslim group that was dormant for many years, has 
claimed responsibility for the attack. ``This was an operation against 
U.S. spies and a warning to the officials who invited them,'' the 
group said in a statement Monday. The warning appeared to refer to 
Khatami's call for cultural exchanges between the United States and 
Iran. The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran after Islamic 
militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran shortly after the 1979 
revolution.
