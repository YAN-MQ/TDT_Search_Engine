Colombian rebels said Thursday that the government has not honored 
its promise to remove all troops from an extensive southern region 
as a condition for holding peace talks. The impasse _ over the presence 
of about 120 soldiers on a base in Caqueta state _ is the first major 
snag in peace talks still in the planning stages between the government 
and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's 
most powerful guerrilla group. Earlier this month, President Andres 
Pastrana withdrew some 2,000 troops and police from the 16,200 square-mile 
(42,000-square-kilometer) area as a security guarantee for guerrilla 
negotiators. He left the 120-member contingent at the base in San 
Vicente del Caguan, however, insisting they were necessary support 
staff for the government's negotiating team. Ignoring weeks of rebel 
criticism, Pastrana has insisted the soldiers _ most of them young 
cadets _ are unarmed and would remain on the base. In the statement 
to reporters on Thursday in the pullout zone, FARC negotiator Fabian 
Ramirez said that if Pastrana did not change his mind and remove the 
troops ``he will bear sole responsibility for the freezing of the 
dialogues.'' Pastrana responded that he would not back down, and urged 
the leftist rebels to press ahead with peace talks to end the country's 
36-year civil war. ``The government will manage its own headquarters,'' 
Pastrana said. Despite the controversy, presidential peace envoy Victor 
G. Ricardo said his preparatory meeting in the southern jungle region 
with the FARC's top commander, Manuel Marulanda, would go forward 
as planned on Friday. The two are to discuss the FARC's insistence 
that the government exchange 452 jailed rebels for some 300 soldiers 
and police the rebels have captured over the past year.
