KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said 
Thursday that Serbs and ethnic Albanians are complying with the cease-fire 
agreement in Kosovo and that two new NATO missions here would make 
verifying that compliance and protecting its monitors much easier. 
Solana said the new Macedonian government had given the green light 
for NATO to base its 1,800-man French-led ``extraction force'' at 
the Macedonian military base in this town just south of the Kosovo 
border. The mission of that force will be to rescue any of the 2,000 
unarmed civilian peace ``verifiers'' now being dispatched to Kosovo. 
Personnel are just beginning to arrive for the Kosovo Verification 
Mission, as it is called. Significant numbers are expected to be operational 
by mid-January. ``This extraction force is a mission of peace,'' Solana 
said, adding that official approval is expected next week when the 
government is installed, but that it had signaled its willingness 
in talks Thursday. ``It is a force needed for humanitarian reasons.'' 
Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander in Europe, said NATO 
would move within 48 hours of the activation order for the force, 
adding that leaders were already here laying the groundwork. Solana 
and Clark were in Macedonia to open the Kosovo Verification Coordination 
Cell, which serves as liaison between NATO's air surveillance flights 
over Kosovo and the ground verification mission just getting started 
under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Information 
about President Slobodan Milosevic's compliance with the deal struck 
with U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke Oct. 12 and both sides' compliance 
with the cease-fire will be collated into a single report. About 60 
military personnel from the United States, Britain, Canada, France, 
Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway and Germany are already in 
place, working in the coordination cell, essentially an operations 
room filled with computers and sophisticated communications equipment. 
Eventually they will number about 140. ``It's here that it will all 
put together ... and transmitted up the NATO command chain,'' said 
Commander Bertie Armstrong of Britain, the center's operations officer. 
Solana said the verification cell is ``further proof of NATO's determination 
to establish long-term peace in Kosovo and in the entire Balkan region.'' 
``Peace and stability in Kosovo may still be a long way off, but the 
spirit of cooperation here make me believe a lasting solution can 
be found,'' he said.
