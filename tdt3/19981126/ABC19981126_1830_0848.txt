Since it is Thanksgiving, we're taking "A closer look" this evening 
at giving. Appropriate. Americans are giving away more money than 
ever before. Religious organizations are the biggest recipients of 
charity -- Churches, synagogues and the like get about half the money 
given away each year, and they disperse most of that to other charities. 
Education is the second biggest beneficiary, colleges and universities 
always do well. Health concerns are the third -- hospitals and clinics. 
About 70% of American households give money and they give generously. 
ABC's Bill Blakemore reports you don't always have to have a lot to 
give a lot. Sometimes this is the face of American giving -- fund 
raisers for the seriously rich, some of whom are extremely generous. 
But most giving in America comes from middle and lower income households. 
I feel an obligation to give back, when I've been very fortunate. 
In fact, of the astonishing $143 billion Americans give away every 
year, 85% comes from individuals, not corporations or foundations. 
And the lower the donor's income, the greater the share of it they 
give. Households with $75,000 to $100,000 income give 1.8%. those 
with less than $10,000, 4.3%. I think people who work understand the 
needs other giv $100 means a great deal to somebody who has very little. 
Simone bedient, retired on a fixed income, mails about $10,000 from 
her one-bedroom New York apartment every year to a variety of charities. 
I really feel a part of them. I feel a certain possessiveness, a sense 
of family connections. Feeling connected to community is a very important 
part of why people give. Americans give more to charities than people 
in any other country. And far more than in other countries, they give 
from across the entire social spectrum. Hi, rose. Here you go. America's 
habit of giving began to surge early in the century. What we now know 
as the united way was formed shortly after world war I, soliciting 
funds from the boys over there and their families. Today, with television 
bringing the world's suffering into the living room, and computers 
systematizing direct mailing lists and phone appeals, giving has soared 
from $17 billion a year in 1960 to nearly nine times that. But experts 
advise, temper your generosity with caution. An organization concerned 
with feeding the hungry can tell you how many people they've fed, 
and those are the kinds of question you are entitled to ask. But these 
experts say most American charities are honest and mean millions more 
people can be thankful for all the giving. Bill Blakemore, ABC News, 
New York.
