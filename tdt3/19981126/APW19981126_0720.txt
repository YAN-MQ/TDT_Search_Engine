The Czech government has established a commission to return Jewish 
property confiscated during World War II, a Jewish community official 
said Thursday. The commission, to include members of the government 
and the Czech Federation of Jewish Communities, is to map out by March 
all property that has not been restituted, Alena Rubesova said. The 
state has already returned some 80 percent of confiscated Jewish properties 
which it held. The government plans to return to surviving Holocaust 
victims all remaining property confiscated by the Nazis during World 
War II. It will also create a fund for compensation where restitution 
is impossible. Besides the state-held properties, the Federation of 
Jewish Communities demands return of property now owned by municipalities 
and individuals. About half of the 202 properties are yet to be returned. 
Restitution was delayed by 40 years of communism, which ended here 
in 1989, and subsequently by insufficient legislation. Some 120,000 
Jews lived on Czech territory before the Holocaust. Now there are 
about 6,000.
