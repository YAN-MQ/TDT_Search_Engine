Pakistan has successfully negotiated a 5-1/2 billion dollar economic 
bail-out package with the IMF and the World Bank. Both international 
financial institutions have stopped lending to Pakistan after sanctions 
were imposed on the country for conducting nuclear tests back in May. 
Ios Gool has details from Islamabad. After two weeks of intensive 
talks with IMF officials, Pakistan Finance Minister Isas Dad announced 
the agreement at a news conference in Islamabad. I'm glad to inform 
you that uh by the greatest almighty Lord we have concluded uh our 
discussions uh with the and the banks. We have reached an agreement 
with them. There is no pending issue. And everything outstanding is 
resolved. The agreement is expected to end month of economic uncertainty 
in Pakistan where economic growth is at the virtual standstill. The 
stock market has plunged to record lows, exports have declined, and 
foreign investment is drying up. Mr. Dad says the loan package will 
include 1.3 billion dollars of fresh cash in-flows from the IMS, the 
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. He says that the remainder 
of the package includes 3.5 billion dollars worth of debt rescheduling 
and restructuring. This is Ios Gool for VOA News, Islamabad.
