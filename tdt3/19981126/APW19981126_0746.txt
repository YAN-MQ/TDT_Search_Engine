European Union regulators are investigating prices charged by airplane 
manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, an EU official said 
Thursday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
the European Commission had sent the companies questions about price 
rises to find out if there is any cartel activity. He told reporters 
the EU executive body's inquiries were not a full cartel probe and 
were not coordinated with U.S. regulators. Airbus spokeswoman Barbara 
Kracht denied any involvement by the European aerospace consortium 
in price-fixing. ``It's absolute nonsense to talk of collusion in 
this industry,'' she said. France-based Airbus and Boeing of the United 
States share the world's market in large commercial jets. Boeing announced 
rises in list prices on most of its aircraft by 5 percent in July, 
the first increase in 23 years. Airbus raised its prices by 3 percent. 
Both companies recently said they want to focus on increasing profits 
rather than market shares after competition between them drove down 
prices. The EU move follows media reports that the US Federal Trade 
Commission was investigating the companies' prices. Kracht acknowledged 
that the industry is concentrated, but insisted competition is fierce. 
Boeing, which absorbed its U.S. competitor McDonnell Douglas last 
year, traditionally has won 60 percent or more of the world's airliner 
orders each year. Although Airbus reached parity this year with orders, 
Boeing has 70 percent of the commercial jet deliveries this year and 
would have 67 percent in 1999 if the forecasts hold. The EU Commission 
imposed tough conditions on Boeing's takeover of McDonnell Douglas 
to ensure the U.S. company did not gain a dominant position in world 
markets. The Airbus consortium comprises Aerospatiale SA of France, 
Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas SA, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG 
of Germany and British Aerospace.
