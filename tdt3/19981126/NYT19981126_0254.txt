Betsy Gotbaum, executive director of the New-York Historical Society 
and a former New York City commissioner of parks and recreation, has 
been in and out of city government for almost three decades without 
running for office. But on Thursday, she said she was thinking of 
running for mayor in 2001. ``Why not?'' the never-shy Ms. Gotbaum, 
60, told a caller after her husband, the retired municipal labor leader 
Victor Gotbaum, dropped a hint in a television news interview that 
his wife might be interested in becoming the first woman mayor in 
the city's history. By law, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may not seek a 
third consecutive term, and, with almost three years to go, the field 
is wide open. Some Democrats most often mentioned as possible candidates 
are the City Council Speaker Peter Vallone; City Comptroller Alan 
Hevesi; Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, and Public Advocate 
Mark Green. Ms. Gotbaum's name has occasionally come up in the last 
few months, but most active Democrats said they considered her a long 
shot. Ms. Gotbaum, who has been a teacher, an investment banker and 
a fund-raiser, has worked for social-service organizations, the Police 
Department and the city's Board of Education. She was parks commissioner 
during the administration of David Dinkins, and knows city politics 
and virtually all the movers and shakers in town. She says she has 
not explored campaign fund raising or tested the waters for support. 
But, she said: ``I have more experience than a lot of people. I've 
worked for almost every mayor since John Lindsay. I raise a lot of 
money. I've never run for office. But that's not a bad thing. Who 
knows? I could get there.''
