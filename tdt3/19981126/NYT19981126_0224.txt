Bernie Wohl learned everything he knows about carving turkeys from 
his brother, Stanley, who used to run a deli. ``The trick,'' Bernie 
said, ``is not to slice the meat off the bird. What you do is take 
the entire breast off the bone first, then slice it on the board.'' 
There he was Thursday on another Thanksgiving, slicing away with the 
sang-froid of a veteran counterman. Poor birds. One after another, 
they disappeared, dozens of them even before the first guests showed 
up, taking their seats at long rows of tables, just in time for Wohl 
to emerge from the kitchen to say how sorry he was to see them. ``I 
wish in many ways that we didn't have to have this dinner here today,'' 
he told them. He wasn't being rude, merely hopeful. His guests, well 
over 1,000, were a battalion from New York's vast army of the homeless. 
On yet another Thanksgiving, they shuffled down a flight of steps 
for a holiday meal at the Goddard Riverside Community Center, on Columbus 
Avenue near West 88th Street. Wohl, 68, has presided there as chief 
carver and executive director for a quarter of a century. But this 
time it was different. This was his last Thanksgiving as head of Goddard 
Riverside, one of the larger social-services agencies in the city, 
operating more than 500 low-income housing units and running an assortment 
of programs for the elderly, the young and the homeless. Next week 
he formally passes the reins to his deputy, Stephan Russo, and starts 
a new life writing and lecturing on the mysteries and agonies of settlement 
houses in the big city. Thursday, though, was about his guests. Wouldn't 
it be wonderful, he said before turkey dinners were laid before them, 
if they had families and homes of their own to go to? ``But that,'' 
he added wistfully, ``is not the way the world works.'' No, the way 
the world works is that it leaves its unpleasant chores to people 
like Wohl, who became something of an institution on Manhattan's Upper 
West Side, mixing kindness with bluster, concern with relentlessness. 
Nobody wants the homeless anymore. Most New Yorkers, when they are 
being honest with themselves, wish these people would just go somewhere 
_ anywhere _ else. But this is one army that is not about to decamp, 
no matter how much the city government tries sweeping it to remote 
corners so the tourists won't stumble across it as they leave their 
hotels. The trick, Wohl said, is ``to see if we can help people come 
back into the world.'' And it can be done, he told a group of men 
and women who showed up on Wednesday at St. Ignatius Episcopal Church, 
on West 87th Street, for a pre-Thanksgiving meal sponsored by a Goddard 
Riverside program for the homeless called The Other Place. ``There 
are so many stereotypes about homeless people,'' he said, ``and that's 
what they are _ stereotypes. You're more than that.'' Mr. Wohl made 
it his task to convince his Upper West Side neighbors that they, too, 
are better than they may realize. West Siders like to think of themselves 
as models of progressiveness. ``These are the West Siders who pride 
themselves on not being East Siders, on celebrating the diversity 
of their neighborhood,'' he said. But in the early '80s, Goddard Riverside 
racked up $100,000 in legal fees defending itself against lawsuits 
brought by those who did not want to see his new community center, 
then being built. ``People said yes, it's needed,'' Wohl said. ``But 
_ you know the rest of the sentence.'' You know it, too: not in my 
back yard. ``Put it in the Bronx somewhere, they'd say,'' he recalled. 
``Ah, but that's old news. Why rehash it? Now they come over and sing 
Christmas carols.'' There certainly was no shortage of volunteers 
on Thursday to cook and serve Thanksgiving dinner to the needy. Dozens 
of would-be volunteers had to be turned away. Sure, some might dismiss 
them as indulged yuppies out to feel better about themselves around 
the holidays. Not Wohl. ``It's a way of getting involved in your neighborhood,'' 
he said. ``This is not the era of human services,'' he continued. 
``It's funny how in America we've never solved the problems of food, 
shelter and clothing.'' The deli man's brother started to slice into 
another turkey, and then paused. ``It's not funny, I guess,'' he said.
