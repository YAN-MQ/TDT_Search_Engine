Nearly two months into the season, it is becoming increasingly difficult 
to predict which Islanders team is going to show up on a given night. 
One night, they find a way to beat one of the league's most talented 
teams in the Philadelphia Flyers. On the very next night, they cannot 
find the net against the less talented Ottawa Senators. Thursday night, 
24 hours after defeating Philadelphia on Long Island, the Islanders 
were defeated by the senators, 4-1, in front of 14,607 at the Corel 
Center. The loss ended the Islanders' two-game winning streak and 
was Ottawa's fourth straight victory. The Islanders (10-12), who have 
not beaten the senators (10-6-3) since 1996-97, were shut down by 
a stifling zone trap defense and nearly shut out by goalie Damian 
Rhodes, who made 26 saves. Islanders goalie Wade Flaherty, who started 
for just the second time this season, made 28 stops. Flaherty has 
lost both starts. The senators got goals from Aleksei Yashin, Vaclav 
Prospal, Lance Pitlick and an empty-net goal from Shaun Van Allen. 
The Islanders got their goal from defenseman Scott Lachance at 13 
minutes 51 seconds of the third period, bringing them to within 3-1. 
By then it was too late. During the first period the Islanders struggled 
on offense. But the senators scored only once against Flaherty, who 
was outstanding in turning away 11 shots. Their first goal was scored 
by Yashin at 18:46. His shot was stopped by the pad of an Islanders 
defenseman, but the puck came right back to Yashin, who beat a sprawling 
Flaherty. Flaherty continued to rescue the Islanders in the second 
period _ he had 12 more saves _ but Ottawa scored again on a rebound 
shot. At 18:18, Prospal put the puck past Flaherty. SLAP SHOTS KENNY 
JONSSON, the Islanders' top defenseman, who sustained a concussion 
last week against the Colorado Avalanche, did not travel with the 
team to Ottawa. He scored the first goal in the Islanders' 4-2 victory 
over the Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday night, but left the game 
with a headache after the second period. He remained in New York on 
Thursday for further testing and rest. His return is not likely until 
the Dec. 2 game against the Rangers, at the earliest.
