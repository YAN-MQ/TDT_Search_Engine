The head of the International Monetary Fund is scheduled to visit 
Russia next week to discuss the nation's financial crisis. Michelle 
Komdasu will meet with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to 
talk about the possibility of releasing the next phase of the $22 
billion in loans that the IMF agreed to provide in July. The next 
payment would amount to about $4.3 billion. The IMF wants firm evidence 
that the Russian government will implement economic reforms before 
it hands over the money.
