For three decades, he's been entertaining audiences as a singer, songwriter 
and consummate entertainer. Now Neil diamond is about to bring his 
audience Flowers once again. Gloria Hillard has the story. Want to 
try one with me? One, two, three. There's no mistaking the voice. 
And bring in the melody. Love on the rocks ain't no surprise How many 
in the audience can finish the lyrics. Yes, we've been listening to 
Neil diamond songs for three decades. A revolving stage. And on this 
day, he's getting ready to begin another world tour. The first one 
in two years. I have to transform myself somehow into this other person 
who can sing and dance and jump around for two hours. I gave you my 
heart, yeah I gave you my soul I always promise myself I'll work out 
for six months before I go out. I just go up and do it. The adrenalin 
you get from the audience is enough to carry you, even if you're body 
won't. The adrenalin will. His new concert tour will include songs 
from his new album, the movie album, "as time goes," by featuring 
classic movie songs. Now I shout it from the highest hills And the 
making of the album is an amc special. We had the good fortune to 
get elmer bernstein to conduct this thing. Those songs were around 
when I was growing up. I remember them, I Sang them. Then he began 
writing his own, at the age of 16. I was taking guitar lessons. Writing 
a song to a girl with be impressive. It's better than Flowers, even. 
Flowers, which brings to mind another diamond classic. Don't bring 
me Flowers I found, after years of writing, many of my songs were 
autobiographical in one way or another. They show some insight into 
myself. As time goes by And taking a cue from that lyric. This time 
of my life is a time of reflection. I've had the most amazing run. 
After this tour, it will be time for me to think about what I'm doing. 
What I want to do with the rest of my life. Gloria Hillard, "CNN Entertainment 
News," Los Angeles.
