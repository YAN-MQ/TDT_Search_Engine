Human activity not the sun is the major cause of global warming according 
to a new report. The paper published in the "Journal Science" contradicts 
some recent studies that suggest global warming has nothing to do 
with people. Toby Mercot of BBC Science has this report. Politics 
plays an important part in this debate. Countries like the United 
States that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases are finding it 
difficult to reduce the amount they produce. Had global warming been 
blamed on solar activity, then there would be no need to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. However, by carefully examining the minute trends in 
temperature changes over the last 115 years, this research points 
the finger of blame ever harder at the major culprits: us. Toby Mercot 
of BBC Science.
