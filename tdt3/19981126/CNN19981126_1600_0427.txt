The death toll is climbing following a collision between two trains 
this morning in India. 7 people were killed and 250 others injured 
after seven cars from one train jumped the tracks. Another train on 
a parallel track slammed into the derailed cars. 1,700 passengers 
were on both trains. It's India's worst train crash in the past three 
years.
