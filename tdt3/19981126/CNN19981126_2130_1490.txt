U.S. automakers have revolutionized the way they sketch new models. 
Ed Garsten reports on the new tools of the trade. It used to take 
hundreds of drawings, dozens of expensive mockups and prototypes, 
and up to four years to develop a new car or truck. But now the automakers 
are using sophisticated computer-aided design systems to eliminate 
most of that and cut the time to market from years to months. Systems 
that used to take us to 12 months to design, we're doing in three 
to six months. General Motors uses what it calls its "math-based" 
system. Here's an example of how it's used to create a new vehicle. 
In this case, a Pontiac grand prix. First, it's sketched on an electronic 
pad. You can see everything goes together pretty quick. Some of our 
brushes, we can bring in wheels. From this point, I can begin to generate 
a 3-D shell over the vehicle. This happens to be the current grand 
prix, fully modeled in math. And then the model is viewed in virtual 
reality. From there, the engineering side takes over without ever 
seeing a clay model or prototype until much later in the process. 
Do you have the performance in terms of the ride and handling that 
you want to have. Does the car heat up and cool the way you want it? 
All those things can now be simulated. The manufacturing team then 
creates a virtual assembly line to decide the best way to actually 
build the car and find bugs ahead of time, so that when it's finally 
built for real, there are no surprises. The car companies are saving 
a lot more than just time by using computer-aided design. GM, for 
one, figures it can save upwards of $200 million of the developing 
of just one vehicle program. By cutting both time and cost, the automakers 
believe they can bring the customer the cars and trucks they want 
cheaper and faster. And that's a reality that's not virtual. Ed Garsten,
