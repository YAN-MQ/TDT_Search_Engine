Britain seeks more time to decide what to do about former Chilean 
dictator Augusto Pinochet. Argentina and Uruguay support Chile's effort 
to block the general's extradition. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu visits London for consultations about the fragile Middle 
East peace process. Violence continues in the West Bank, where Israeli 
soldiers have clashed with Palestinian protesters. We'll visit a shelter 
in Zambia which offers a temporary refuge to women who are in a desperate 
situation, often in fear for their lives. I'm Tony Riggs. And I'm 
Aren Brummett. Those stories coming up, along with sports and business 
news. And we'll learn what it means to be a member of the Cherokee 
Indian nation, all in this hour of VOA News Now. First, the news.
