I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News. British Home Secretary Jack Straw has 
requested that the courts give him more time to decide whether to 
begin extradition proceedings against former Chilean dictator Augusto 
Pinochet. Britain's High Court, Wednesday, denied General Pinochet 
immunity. Mr. Straw has asked for an additional week, because he expects 
to hear many arguments regarding Spain's extradition request. The 
former Chilean leader is accused of genocide, terrorism and torture.
