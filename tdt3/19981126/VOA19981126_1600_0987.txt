This is the Voice of America coming to you from Washington. I'm Erin 
Brummett, with Tony Riggs, brining you this hour of VOA News Now. 
At 21 hours, 17 Universal Time, here is the major news story we are 
following. The British government asks the courts for more time to 
decide whether to open extradition proceedings against former Chilean 
dictator Augusto Pinochet. I'll have more on that and the rest of 
the hour's top news in our next summary in about 12 minutes.
