As the holiday shopping marathon begins Friday, bells are ringing 
on Madison Avenue. There are Christmas chimes, of course, and the 
jingle of cash registers (or at least the whisper of platinum plastic). 
But the peal most audible to store owners and real estate agents is 
of celebration, tinged ever so slightly with alarm. Madison Avenue 
between 57th and 72nd streets has just been officially declared the 
most expensive stretch of shopping space in New York, in the United 
States and in the world. To rent 1 square foot of space there costs 
an average of $550 a year, according to a survey by Cushman &AMP; 
Wakefield, the big international real estate firm. That may not surprise 
anyone who has ambled down the avenue lately, but it does represent 
a change from just a year or two ago, when Fifth Avenue was a far 
more expensive spot to open a store, and Causeway Bay in Hong Kong 
was the most expensive retailing real estate on the planet. Just five 
years ago, it seemed as if almost every block of Madison was pocked 
by an empty storefront. In its own way, the current state of Madison 
Avenue illuminates some of the most powerful economic trends now shaping 
New York: the shrinking globe, the resurgent stock market and, of 
course, all those tourists. And boy, are they out there, dressed in 
bright hues and sensible shoes, jamming what used to be the exclusive 
shopping district of Fifth Avenue between 57th Street and Rockefeller 
Center. While some of the most glamorous names in selling _ like Bergdorf 
Goodman and the jeweler Harry Winston _ are still on Fifth, so are 
all the stores that sell sneakers and blue jeans and Bugs Bunny wabbitiana. 
``The feeling is that 57th and Fifth have lost their cachet,'' said 
Susan Kurland, a director of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. For expensive 
retailers, particularly those from Europe, she added, the area just 
has too many ``mid-America mall-type tenants.'' Which is why the most 
chic stores have been flocking to this stretch of Madison, where real 
estate costs are only slightly ahead of those on Fifth and 57th. Fashion 
designers whose names are best known to the devoted readers of Vogue 
are lining the avenue: Cerruti is opening its first American store 
near 67th Street, Gianfranco Ferre is expanding at 70th, Gianni Versace 
is revamping at 68th, next to the new Max Mara store, and Hermes, 
a stalwart on 57th Street, has plans to move to Madison at 62nd. And 
that's just to name a few. Tourneau, which specializes in lavish watches, 
has two stores on Madison that are just two blocks apart _ but worlds 
away from each other. On 57th is the ``Time Machine,'' four floors 
of loud music, flashing lights, video screens and zillions of watches, 
from the $18,500 Paul Newman Rolex (``pre-owned,'' though not by the 
movie star himself) to $40 plastic Swatches decorated with teddy bears. 
At 59th is a more traditional jewel box of a store, full of glass 
and wood cases, solicitous salespeople and gleaming ``timepieces.'' 
No plastic. Prices start at about $200, and get as high as $43,000 
for a gold Patek Philippe wristwatch, even higher for antique jewelry. 
``Fifty-seventh is a must-see for anyone visiting New York,'' said 
Anthony D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of Tourneau, which opened 
its store there last year. ``Upper Madison Avenue,'' he added, ``is 
a must-see for a certain type.'' That's the rich type, the European 
type, the big-spending type. When designers are asked why they must 
be on Madison, they tend to claim that they sort of stumbled on the 
perfect spot for a store, which just happened to be on Madison. For 
example, following in the footsteps of Giorgio Armani, who two years 
ago opened two stores on Madison, Donna Karan recently announced that 
she would open a shop for her most luxurious line between 68th and 
69th streets. Real estate experts say the clustering of designer stores 
on Madison is no accident. ``Retailers are feeling the necessity to 
be around each other, to keep up with the Joneses,'' said Robert Cohen, 
senior managing director of RKF &AMP; Associates. International _ 
mostly European _ names dominate big stretches of Madison, and foreign 
tourists are among their biggest customers. Even, perhaps especially, 
if the same brands are available back home. (Baccarat, the French 
crystal store, was recently full of French people.) Last year, 6 million 
foreign tourists spent $1.3 billion just on shopping in the city, 
according to the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau, while 
the 27 million American tourists spent less than $600 million in shops. 
This year, the number of visitors from abroad is down slightly because 
of the economic turmoil in Asia. But the number of travelers from 
Europe and Latin America has increased, the board said. For designers 
and manufacturers trying to appeal to these shoppers, Madison Avenue 
today serves as a genteel, expensive billboard. Most of the stores 
sell only their own merchandise, not products produced by others, 
as department stores and traditional boutiques do. Probably half of 
them, real estate mavens estimate, have moved to the avenue in the 
last three or four years. It is the billboard effect that makes retailers 
willing to pay more per square foot than, in many instances, they 
can possibly hope to recoup by selling even the most expensive handbags 
or shearling coats. ``They're loss leaders,'' said Ms. Kurland of 
Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. That is not true for all of them, of course. 
Both Armani and Timberland report that they do big business on Madison 
Avenue. But for most of these stores, ``if they are making money, 
it is not much,'' said Howard Davidowitz, a longtime retailing analyst. 
Despite what he called ``the hiccup in the financial markets,'' Davidowitz 
said he expected this to be a great Christmas for city retailers. 
Other forecasters are a bit more subdued, but far more optimistic 
than they were just two months ago. Madison Avenue should benefit 
from the recovery of the stock market _ which hit an all-time high 
this week _ because it puts money in the pockets of ``the more established 
rich of the Upper East Side,'' said Alex Cohen, the research director 
of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. On the other hand, many bond traders have 
lost their jobs, and Wall Street bonuses are likely to be far lower 
than they were last year. And the stock market's gyrations appear 
to have unnerved consumers, who tell pollsters that when doing their 
holiday shopping, they are more interested in ``value'' _ retail-speak 
for cheap stuff _ than they were a year ago. That is where the alarm 
bells come in. While a poor Christmas season is hard on all retailers, 
it can kill those with high real estate costs to cover. That fact 
has been easy to ignore for several years, at least until last summer, 
when the stock market plunged and economists began predicting that 
a recession might occur. ``I sincerely hope rents are coming to some 
sort of peak,'' said Cohen of RKF, ``because they have been getting 
a little out of hand.''
