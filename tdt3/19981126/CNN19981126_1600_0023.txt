"CNN Headline News." I'm Chuck Roberts. Thanks for sharing your Thanksgiving 
with us. Americans are celebrating the holiday in several different 
ways. They are enjoying the company of friends and family, attending 
traditional events, like the Macy's parade, counting their blessings 
and helping those who are less fortunate. In Atlanta, singers were 
among the many volunteers who helped make the 30th annual "feed the 
hungry" campaign a success. 1,000 people attended the Turkey dinner 
at Turner field, hosted by the reverend hosea Williams. Some took 
advantage of free medical screenings and available showers. People 
in the nation's capital also are volunteering their time this thanksgiving. 
For some, it has become as much of a holiday tradition as Turkey and 
pumpkin Pie. I kind of do this every year. I've been doing it for 
the last like five years. And basically, to be able to give back to 
the public and, you know, to give back to people the less fortunate 
and everything.
