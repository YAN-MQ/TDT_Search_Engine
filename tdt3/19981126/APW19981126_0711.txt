Police requested an investigation into alleged corruption and mismanagement 
of one of Croatia's top private bankers Thursday, said a police spokesman. 
Marko Marcinko, chief manager of the bankrupt Glumina Banka, will 
be investigated for ``abuse of position and powers,'' said Josip Begovic, 
a Zagreb police spokesman. Police have conducted a preliminary investigation 
but, under Croatian law, must request the district attorney launch 
a full investigation before he can be charged and stand trial. If 
convicted, Marcinko could face a fine or three years in jail. Glumina 
Banka, one of Croatia's largest private banks, recently declared bankruptcy 
after Marcinko failed to find foreign investors or attract state funds 
to save the bank. Experts blamed the bankruptcy on the bank's high-risk 
investments, plus low-interest loans and high interest savings accounts 
for politicians and other influential people. Earlier this year, authorities 
froze Glumina Banka's accounts, enraging thousands of clients. The 
state said it will use reserves to guarantee savings only up to 100,000 
kuna (dlrs 16,600). Last May, the government was forced to save Croatia's 
fifth largest bank, Dubrovacka Banka, after a nationwide corruption 
scandal allegedly involving senior state officials. Authorities charged 
a senior bank official and an alleged accomplice with fraud and embezzlement. 
They are to be tried in early December. Currently, 60 banks and 33 
savings institutions operate in Croatia, a surplus for this nation 
of 4.8 million.
