Pete Sampras made tennis history Thursday, holding the No. 1 ranking 
for a record sixth consecutive year. He assured himself the top ranking 
for 1998 when Marcelo Rios pulled out of the ATP Tour World Championship 
because of a back injury. Rios withdrew before his match against Greg 
Rusedski. Sampras had been tied with Jimmy Connors, each finishing 
No. 1 for five straight years. The new record is unlikely to be ever 
broken, Sampras said earlier this week. Rios, ranked No. 2, was the 
only man who could have threatened Sampras for the top ranking. Sampras 
entered the tournament with a 33-point lead over the Chilean in the 
computer standings. ``I waited until the last minute,'' Rios said. 
``I went to bed last night thinking I would play.'' ``But when I tried 
to practice this morning, it was really sore. It made no sense to 
go out on the court and play two games,'' Rios said. ``I am disappointed 
but that's the way it goes.'' ``It's really, really sore, it's so 
sore that I can't go on court. Pulling out of a tournaments is always 
bad and you don't feel good,'' Rios said. Sampras, who played Karol 
Kucera later Thursday, already has clinched a berth in the semifinals 
of the season-ending tournament he has won four times. In the first 
match Thursday, Tim Henman beat Alex Corretja 7-6 (7-4), 6-7, (4-7), 
6-2 to become the second player to advance to the semifinals. Corretja 
dropped to 1-1 but remains alive under the round-robin format. Henman 
is 2-0. Rusedski, an alternate, played Albert Costa, the second alternate. 
Rusedski replaced Andre Agassi, who dropped out late Wednesday, also 
because of a back injury. The elite dlrs 3.5 million tournament brings 
together players with the best results over the year. But with Patrick 
Rafter and Richard Krajicek both pulling out before the event because 
of injuries and Agassi and Rios withdrawing, four of the best players 
are missing. Rios had to do better than Sampras in the tournament 
to have a shot at dethroning him. But Sampras scored quick and impressive 
victories in his opening matches. Rios had already dented his hopes 
of overtaking Sampras by losing his first match, to Henman. ``It's 
certainly a good feeling to be here over the weekend,'' Sampras said 
after beating Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday. ``I'm also helping 
myself by winning. I can't really be too concerned about what Marcelo 
is doing,'' Sampras said. ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If 
I take care of things myself and go out and win, then it should be 
hopefully good enough.'' Sampras was not even aware that he had clinched 
a place in the semis. ``It's not easy to play well like I have been 
today and yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,'' 
Sampras said. ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit 
more than last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much 
pressure on him as possible.'' Sampras now has one more record to 
go for. With 11 Grand Slam titles, he is one behind Roy Emerson. By 
his standards, Sampras has had a relatively modest year, winning four 
tournaments. That included his fifth Wimbledon, but no other Grand 
Slams. Sampras leads all active players with 56 career titles. Connors' 
record of 109 looks safe for a long time to come.
