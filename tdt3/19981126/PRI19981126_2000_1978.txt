Washington is reportedly formulating a new and more aggressive military 
strategy to counter any attack on South Korea by troops from the Communist 
north. A military advance from the south would be met with a full

"Far Eastern Economic Review." The publication says military chiefs 
in the U.S. and South Korea still have to approve the revised strategy.
