The rain poured down in buckets, a third of the giant balloons had 
to be withdrawn for technical problems, and overhanging the whole 
affair was the stark memory of a terrible accident last year. But 
the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade managed to strut two and a half 
miles down Broadway on a cold, soggy, sometimes blustery day, bringing 
smiles to the faces of children and a festive beginning to the city's 
holiday season. The 72nd annual parade brought together a dozen marching 
bands, 12 giant balloons and 18 floats to entertain an enthusiastic 
crowd, although four of the balloons never made it past the starting 
point. The crowd was smaller than the usual 2 million, a Macy's official 
said, but how much smaller was not clear. Departing from past practice, 
the Police Department did not provide an estimate of the crowd and 
referred the question to Macy's, which could not answer it. Officer 
John Seidl, a police spokesman, would not say why the police had declined 
to provide an estimate, as they did in last week's ticker-tape parade 
honoring John Glenn. The gray day was marked by shivering majorettes 
smiling almost defiantly; giggling little boys perched on fathers' 
shoulders; Mayor Rudolph Giuliani waving enthusiastically at marchers 
as he stood and watched the parade at West 76th Street; occasional 
gusts of wind strong enough to rip umbrellas apart, and robust cheers 
for the Yankees manager Joe Torre and the pitcher David Cone. ``It 
was an extraordinary parade,'' said Ronnie Taffet, Macy's vice president 
for public relations, noting that the Santa Claus float, the last 
in the parade, arrived at Herald Square at almost the exact moment 
when the sun peeped through the clouds. ``Everything was just perfect.'' 
Many watchers agreed. ``We're having a great time,'' said Beth Davenport 
of Manhattan, a pediatric nurse watching the parade with a group. 
``If we stayed at home all day, it wouldn't have been so special.'' 
But others were not so pleased. ``Don't ask me if I had a good time,'' 
said Joe Amaral, a construction worker from Ludlow, Mass. ``My brother-in-law 
made me come out in the rain. I'm soaking wet. I bought a $6 umbrella 
and it fell apart.'' Though the weather was obviously uncontrollable, 
parade organizers seemed to have left little else to chance. This 
year the city and Macy's instituted tough new rules and procedures 
to lessen the chance of an accident like last year's, when the Cat 
in the Hat balloon _ driven by fierce winds _ escaped from its handlers 
and slammed into a lamppost, knocking off its horizontal arm. The 
falling lamppost arm struck Kathleen Caronna, 34, of Manhattan in 
the skull and knocked her to the ground. She spent nearly a month 
in a coma and suffered brain damage; she has sued Macy's, the manufacturer 
of the lamppost and the city for $395 million. The cautious approach 
was evident in a decision to remove three giant balloons before the 
parade even began, because a chamber in each had leaked helium during 
the night. Those balloons were Garfield, Spiderman and the Quik Bunny. 
A fourth balloon, Wild Thing, based on a character from the Maurice 
Sendak children's story ``Where the Wild Things Are,'' was removed 
after it struck a tree at Central Park West and West 77th Street, 
the parade's starting point. The removal of Wild Thing left only eight 
giant balloons in the parade, seven fewer than the total number that 
have flown in some previous parades. Earlier this year, five balloons 
were permanently retired because they were too big, too awkward or, 
in the case of Cat in the Hat, ``inappropriate,'' as a Macy's spokesman 
put it. Macy's maintains a stable of 25 balloons that it rotates in 
and out of the parade. In addition to Wild Thing, two other giant 
balloons were introduced this year: Babe, a cinematic pig, and Dexter, 
a cartoon boy genius. The city's new rules require that balloons be 
withdrawn from the parade if sustained winds exceed a speed of 23 
mph or if gusts exceed 34 mph. Thursday's wind speeds never reached 
those limits. But Macy's and city officials had agreed, before the 
parade began, to fly the balloons at a lower-than-usual altitude, 
making them less susceptible to sudden wind shifts. Some occasionally 
dipped as low as 4 or 5 feet off the ground. Some parade watchers 
objected to this change. ``The balloons were too low,'' said Dillon 
De Young of Westhampton. ``They looked too overwhelming.'' Others 
found it an improvement. ``We were able to see them better because 
they were lower,'' said Maurice McGrath of the Bronx. ``It was wonderful.'' 
Other procedures were changed to enhance safety. The big balloons 
were guided by up to 60 trained handlers each, 20 more than last year. 
The 12 largest balloons had utility vehicles as anchors and technicians 
with meters to check wind speeds at each intersection. Along the parade 
route, lampposts were rotated so that the armatures would not jut 
into the street, trees were drastically trimmed and stoplights were 
pivoted out of the way. And for the first time, all handlers had to 
have passed a physical-fitness test. There was also an enormous police 
contingent, with an officer stationed approximately every 10 feet 
along the parade route. Some parade watchers found this irksome. A 
CBS parade commentator complained that the officers were preventing 
her from interviewing people. Vicki Sankey of Harrison said the officers 
were more interested in keeping their areas clear of people than in 
``getting us to see the parade.'' She said, ``It was so frustrating.'' 
But others said the police were helpful. ``They could have been mean 
and rude, but they were nice,'' said Fred Mitchell, a tourist from 
Heber Springs, Ark. ``They were fun. They told many jokes.'' As the 
parade began at 9 a.m. at the south end of the American Museum of 
Natural History, the announcer said, ``Let's have a parade!'' But 
the memory of last year's accident hung heavily and inescapably. ``I'm 
just scared,'' said Christine Arias, who lives in New Hyde Park and 
was one of Babe's handlers. ``I don't want anyone to get hurt. I just 
want a happy parade.'' Kathleen Caronna and her husband, Massimo, 
and their 19-month-old son did not attend this year's parade, said 
their lawyer, John Q. Kelly. They were visiting Massimo Caronna's 
family in Italy. Kelly said his client's recovery is far from complete. 
``It's a day-to-day battle,'' he said. ``Some days she'll take a step 
forward and some days she'll take two steps back.'' Kelly said that 
when Ms. Caronna returned home from the hospital in February, the 
family ate the Thanksgiving dinner that Massimo Caronna had put in 
the freezer after the accident. He said she had never read her son 
``The Cat in the Hat,'' the Dr. Seuss book she had bought just a week 
before the accident. The weather defined Thursday's parade. Although 
the National Weather Service said just 0.59 of an inch of rain had 
fallen in Central Park during the three hours it took marchers to 
complete the route, the precipitation never let up, and at times it 
pounded down hard. Near the parade's beginning, at West 64th Street 
and Central Park West, grim-faced parents were towing confused, sopping-wet 
children away from the crowd toward Columbus Avenue even as the low-flying 
and much-beloved Big Bird sailed serenely behind their backs. But 
many professed not to mind the rain, and a few even said they welcomed 
it. ``A beautiful sunny day would be nothing,'' said Ron, a handler 
for the Garfield balloon who declined to give his complete name. ``This 
is a challenge.'' Another parade worker also looked on the bright 
side. ``The rain is good luck,'' said Sabrina Serio, a balloon handler 
from the Bronx. ``It means the parade is going to go well.''
