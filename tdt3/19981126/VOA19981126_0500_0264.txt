The top Serbian official says anything beyond local self rule in Kosovo 
would probably trigger a regional war. Serbia's Deputy Prime Minister 
says that making Kosovo a Republic and Yugoslavia would lead to more 
bloodshed. He spoke in Pristina as Serbian leaders and representatives 
of ethnic groups approved a government plan to resolve the crisis. 
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have rejected the plan and again boycotted 
the talks.
