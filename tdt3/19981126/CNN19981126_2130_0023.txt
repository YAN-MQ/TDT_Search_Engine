This is "CNN Headline News." I'm Denise Dillon, sitting in for Lynne 
Russell. Happy Thanksgiving. High winds and rain couldn't dampen the 
enthusiasm of the thousands of spectators who turned out for Macy's 
72nd annual Thanksgiving day parade. New safety restrictions were 
taken after an accident last year. But blustery weather left its Mark 
again. Wind gusts up to 30 miles an hour took four giant balloons 
out of the lineup, including spiderman and the new entry, "wild thing," 
from the children's book, "where the wild things are." It deflated 
after it blew into a lamppost. We were coming down the quarter over 
here and some wind picked up and followed through and caught up in 
the light here and popped a hole in the side. And we had to deflate 
it. Despite rain and wind, thousands of spectators lined the streets 
for the macy's parade. And many of the balloons were kept under control 
for folks to enjoy. Parades marked the day in many cities. In Houston, 
Texas, enjoyed temperatures well into the 70s for their thanksgiving 
parade.
