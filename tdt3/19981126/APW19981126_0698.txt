Spanish club Real Mallorca on Thursday withdrew its appeal against 
a four-match suspension imposed by UEFA on its winger Iovan Stankovic. 
``There was a problem with interpretation when it was explained to 
us why he was being suspended,'' said Mallorca club director Ramon 
Servalls. ``Now it has been cleared up so we don't have any protest.'' 
Stankovic was suspended for violent conduct during his team's Cup 
Winners Cup second-round match against Genk of Belgium earlier this 
month. In the day's earlier case, Mallorca came out the winner when 
UEFA's appeal body upheld its rejection of a protest by Genk about 
the advertising boards in the Spanish club's Luis Sitjar stadium. 
Genk claimed the boards were not at regulation distance from the playing 
area. ``It was up to the referee to decide if the match should be 
played,'' said Peter Limacher, UEFA's section manager for disciplinary 
matters. UEFA had to decide whether referee Remi Harrel of France 
had abused his powers of discretion. ``The board of appeal felt he 
did not,'' Limacher said. UEFA regulations stipulate that advertising 
panels be placed 4 meters (13.1 feet) from the edge of the playing 
area. Mallorca's boards were only about a half meter (1 1/2 feet) 
from the touchline, Limacher said. ``They acknowledged the pitch was 
irregular but the degree of irregularity was an important factor,'' 
Limacher said. ``In this case it was considered to be a minor irregularity.'' 
UEFA also noted Genk, which knew the problem long before the start 
of the match, lodged its protest just 20 minutes before kickoff. The 
protest ``complied with the regulations,'' said Limacher. ``But they 
should have protested earlier or informed the Spanish club in time 
for it to make necessary changes.'' Mallorca was fined 5,000 Swiss 
francs (dlrs 3,600) and its stadium will undergo a full inspection 
by UEFA within the next two weeks. UEFA will then decide if changes 
are required, Limacher said. ``The club is about to construct a new 
stadium where the conditions will be much better.'' After Mallorca 
knocked out Scottish club Hearts in the first round, UEFA rejected 
an appeal from Hearts over the size of the goalposts at the Spanish 
club's stadium.
