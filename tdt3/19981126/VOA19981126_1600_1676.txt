A Canadian Researcher says the remarkable ability of whales to communicate 
and socialize, using long distance sonar signaling may have been passed 
down, along with their genes. Hal Whitehead of Dalhouser University 
in Nova Scotia says he has found the first evidence, cultural behavior 
is passed on down the generations through genetic material, in a species 
other than humans. Mr. Whitehead focused his studies on Pilot. Sperm, 
and Killer Whales. He theorizes cultural behavior is passed along 
in the whale's mitochondria DNA in cells, which he says shows a strikingly 
low level of genetic diversity. The research is reported in the Journal 
Science.
