Warren Hunting Smith, who devoted more than 50 years of his life to 
editing the letters of Horace Walpole, died Nov. 22 at his home in 
Geneva, N.Y. He was 93. From 1931 to 1982, Smith worked in Yale University's 
Sterling Library on a project that had been started in 1924. The result 
is a 48-volume edition of Walpole papers, an indispensable source 
on the life of the 18th-century English author and man of letters. 
While admitting that others might think his work tedious, Smith found 
a special pleasure in projecting himself back to Walpole's day. Walpole, 
who lived from 1717 to 1797, was the son of the British prime minister, 
Sir Robert Walpole, and was himself a member of Parliament as well 
as a writer. His literary reputation rests largely on his letters, 
in which he wrote about everything from Benjamin Franklin's experiments 
with electricity to the discovery of the planet Uranus. ``It was something 
like existing in a monastery,'' said Smith in 1983, after the project 
was completed. ``There were these Gothic arches, and we were sitting 
there like medieval monks, reading manuscripts.'' He said it was pleasant 
being in ``the backwater of the university,'' as he peacefully went 
about his daily work researching and editing and writing footnotes 
in what was popularly referred to as the Walpole Factory. It was before 
the days of the computer, and Smith did all his work by hand. Frank 
Brady, chairman of the project that edited the papers of James Boswell 
at Yale, marveled at the painstaking labors. He compared it to being 
``in the solarium when Gutenberg came along,'' and concluded that 
``no one will ever do that again.'' The project began in 1924 when 
Wilmarth Lewis, a 1918 graduate of Yale and a book collector, bought 
several Walpole letters. Those letters inspired him to collect Walpole's 
books, letters and memorabilia and to make him his life's work. Lewis 
financed the project at Yale and was in charge of it until his death 
in 1979. Smith began working with Lewis as a graduate student. After 
Lewis died, Smith, one of 14 editors and 48 students involved in the 
process, took over the older scholar's mission as managing editor, 
with a zeal equal to that of his predecessor. ``The Yale Edition of 
Horace Walpole's Letters'' was never intended to have a large readership, 
with a first edition limited to 1,250 copies. But some of the early 
volumes went into a second printing. The index takes up five volumes, 
and the work on it was principally attributed to Smith. Lewis' home 
in Farmington, Conn., which he donated to Yale, houses the university's 
Walpole Library, by far the largest repository of Walpole material. 
Smith was born in Geneva, N.Y. He graduated from Yale in 1927 and 
received a Ph.D. from Yale in 1931. During World War II, he served 
in U.S. Army intelligence. In addition to his work on Walpole, he 
published six books, including histories of Geneva and Hobart and 
William Smith Colleges, and two novels set in his hometown. No immediate 
family members survive. Walpole was his consuming passion, but even 
as he immersed himself in the author's world of letters, the man himself 
remained at a remove. ``Walpole never completely unbuttoned, so to 
speak,'' Smith said. ``He wrote a great deal about his prejudices 
and opinions on all subjects but very little about himself.''
