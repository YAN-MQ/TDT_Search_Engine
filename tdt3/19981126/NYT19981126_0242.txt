It looks like any other brand-new BMW 540i. But try firing a .44 Magnum 
at the ``540i Protection'' _ it handles bullets as blithely as Superman 
does. Still, no car can do everything that the Man of Steel can; the 
540i Protection still has to be driven around tall buildings. We are 
talking armored cars here, automobiles that have been fortified to 
withstand attacks by shady characters with guns or crowbars in their 
hands and larceny, or worse, on their minds. Turning out these cars, 
customized to keep the enemy out, is a growing business: O'Gara-Hess 
&AMP; Eisenhardt, the armored-car division of the far-flung Kroll-O'Gara 
security company, has opened factories in four countries in the last 
five years. Until 1993, it did all its work at its Cincinnati headquarters. 
BMW, too, sees demand for armored cars that do not look like armored 
cars. The bottom line, BMW says, is the bottom line: Installing security 
equipment at the factory is less expensive than having the materials 
added after a car has left the assembly line. BMW maintains that these 
after-market alterations weaken the cars they are meant to strengthen. 
``It is a fact that work of this kind often means a loss of quality,'' 
said Edward Hightower, manager of 5- and 7-Series cars for BMW of 
North America. ``And you don't have the body panels being disassembled, 
as by an after-market supplier, which in most cases voids the manufacturer's 
responsibility.'' Or, by another name, the warranty. O'Gara-Hess disputes 
the idea that a specialty coach builder cannot do the job. ``To answer 
the idea that we're going to mess up the car, we've never, ever had 
that complaint, not even once,'' said Dan Heimbrock, O'Gara-Hess' 
marketing manager. ``You're only adding a couple hundred pounds, the 
majority of it glass. The competency has to be that you put the glass 
in right and put the trim back. It's not tremendously complicated. 
The hard part is how do you make sure that the armor is integrated 
into the body of the car so that the bullets don't go through _ ever.'' 
To keep that from happening, O'Gara-Hess' Lincoln Town Car has reinforced 
body panels and an armored roof. BMW's 540i Protection (yes, the ``P'' 
word is part of the name) comes factory-equipped with everything needed 
to outgun and outrun the average armed assailant, from a bullet-resistant 
body and windows to run-flat tires. That is also everything that Bonnie 
and Clyde could have wished for in a getaway car, though BMW's marketing 
pitch is aimed at potential victims _ high-profile types whose names 
are more likely to appear in the gossip columns than on most-wanted 
posters. BMW insists that the 540i Protection was not designed with 
drug lords in mind. ``That's certainly not something we're promoting,'' 
Hightower said. ``We're not promoting or targeting any illegal type 
of activity.'' O'Gara-Hess goes a step further, running background 
checks on customers. ``There are enough lower-end companies that don't 
care who they serve, particularly in places like Colombia,'' Heimbrock 
said. ``If someone shows up on our doorstep with a suitcase full of 
money, we don't just hand them the keys.'' Hess &AMP; Eisenhardt, 
predecessor of O'Gara-Hess, began as a maker of ambulances and hearses 
and got into the armored-car business at the request of the Secret 
Service in the 1940s. Heimbrock said today's customers were ``people 
who are afraid of rape, abduction, kidnapping or armed assault.'' 
All are high-profile people, he said, and most fall into one of three 
categories: celebrities, politicians or captains of industry. ``Outside 
the United States, the market is much broader,'' he said. The BMW 
540i Protection has mats of a plastic tissuelike material called aramide 
fiber _ which BMW says is lighter and stronger than bulletproof vests 
_ tucked like insulation behind the body panels and the back seat. 
If a hapless attacker tries to drill his way in, BMW says the material 
will wrap itself around the drill bit, rendering it useless. BMW also 
replaces the conventional windows with reinforced glass made with 
nearly invisible steel fibers. Don't try to roll down the rear windows 
to wave at crowds: As a precaution against would-be assassins, the 
windows do not move. Also, hope that sledgehammer-wielding attackers 
miss the mark. At least one auto writer _ a latter-day Clark Kent 
_ managed to crack the glass with a forceful heave at a demonstration 
arranged by BMW. Hightower said the changes added only 255 pounds 
of weight, raising the car's 0-to-60 acceleration time to 6.7 seconds, 
only a half-second slower than an unarmored 540i. And while the car 
may be intended for people who like to shift for themselves in the 
real world, they must accept an automatic: The 540i Protection is 
not available with a stick shift. It goes 21.4 miles on a gallon of 
premium, the same as an ordinary, thin-skinned 540i. Hightower said 
the price had not been set; the 540i Protection will cost more than 
the $51,670 sticker of an ordinary 540i with an automatic transmission. 
O'Gara-Hess offers modifications on 20 brands of cars. It charges 
$45,000 to convert a Lincoln Town Car, not including the car. It is, 
Heimbrock said, ``a logical, affordable, practical piece of personal 
security equipment'' _ one that is designed to be driven away from 
danger. That means the car has to keep running. So the battery is 
encased in bullet-resistant material. (``It can take multiple ballistic 
impacts or even penetrations from bullets,'' he said.) The O'Gara-Hess 
Lincoln has armor on the roof and sides, but not the floor (that is 
an option). The idea is to provide what Heimbrock called ``protection 
against what the common criminal uses, which is typically easy-to-conceal 
handguns and submachine-gun types of threats.'' ``Not too often will 
you see a street thug with an M-16,'' he said. ``The rebels up in 
the mountains have those, but the guy who's going to rip off your 
watch, he's going to come up with a 9-millimeter handgun.''
