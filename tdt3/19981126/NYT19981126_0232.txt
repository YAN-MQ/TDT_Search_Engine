The Giuliani administration told city agencies this week to cut their 
budgets for next year, in part to offset an anticipated $500 million 
revenue loss from the elimination of an income tax surcharge on city 
residents' salaries, the mayor's budget director said Thursday. Robert 
Harding, the director of the Office of Budget and Management, said 
he had sent a memorandum to city commissioners Wednesday asking them 
to find $600 million to $700 million in budget cuts for fiscal year 
2000, starting July 1. Mayor Rudolph Guiliani is to present his preliminary 
budget in January. Harding said the city must close a $2 billion gap 
between projected revenues and spending. A memorandum asking commissioners 
to scour their departments for cuts has become an annual rite under 
Giuliani before he unveils his budget proposals. But the cuts requested 
this week go deeper than the appeal last year, when the budget gap 
was between $600 million and $800 million, Harding said. Last year's 
request was smaller because city coffers were swelled by increased 
tax receipts courtesy of Wall Street's good fortune. Since the summer, 
Giuliani has been warning that dips in the stock market will shrink 
the city's capital gains tax revenues. Those reduced expectations 
and the income tax cut led to this year's requests, Harding said. 
``The deficit that needs to be cut is greater,'' he said. Giuliani 
had warned earlier this month that the tax break would mean cuts in 
the city's $34 billion budget. But the level of cuts was not known 
until this week's memorandum. In a budget pact announced on Nov. 17 
after a five-month standoff between the mayor and the City Council, 
the two sides agreed to eliminate the 12.5 percent income tax surcharge. 
The surcharge, enacted in 1991, raises $500 million each year but 
was to expire on Dec. 31 unless the City Council asked the state Legislature 
to extend the tax. This year, about a third of that projected deficit 
will be made up by budget cuts. The rest of the money will come from 
revised estimates of tax revenue, as well as from other non-tax sources 
of income, like land sales, Harding said. Agencies have until the 
second week in December to present their proposals to the budget office. 
Various departments have been asked to make different levels of cuts, 
Harding said by telephone from North Carolina, where he was celebrating 
the Thanksgiving holiday. He said he did not have information available 
on how much each agency had been asked to trim. But he said the Police 
Department and other uniformed services had been asked to absorb smaller 
cuts. Most of the Police Department's expenses come from salaries, 
and the mayor does not want to reduce the number of officers on the 
force, Harding said. Some other departments' budgets cannot be cut 
because of federal requirements or matching money from federal or 
state agencies, he said. That means the largest cuts would have to 
come from other departments in which personnel costs make up smaller 
parts of the budget, like the Department of Transportation. A spokesman 
for that department said he was unaware of memorandum.
