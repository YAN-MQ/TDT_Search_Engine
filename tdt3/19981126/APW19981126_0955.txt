Stock markets in Asia and Europe advanced Thursday, as Japanese investors 
awaited economic stimulus measures and the European markets percolated 
with rumors of a big oil merger. Tokyo's main index, the 225-issue 
Nikkei Stock Average, gained 134.30 points, or 0.89 percent, closing 
at 15,207.77. The index rebounded from a drop of 91.17 points Wednesday. 
Share prices rose amid optimism that recent moves to stabilize Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi's government will prove beneficial to the ailing 
Japanese economy. Investors have been encouraged by an alliance between 
Obuchi's ruling party and the minority Liberal Party, which has called 
for suspending an unpopular sales tax and trimming the government 
bureaucracy, traders said. The main stock index has rallied about 
800 points this week, closing above 15,000 points Tuesday for first 
time since Aug. 25. In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 
57.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 10,778.92. The Hang Seng 
has gained 8.4 percent over the past two weeks. Thursday, financial 
giant HSBC Holdings led the charge, rising 5 Hong Kong dollars to 
its highest level in more than six months. Most other Asian markets 
posted slim gains or losses, with the exception of South Korea, where 
shares fell 3.8 percent. Analysts said the losses were caused by massive 
selling by local institutional investors to hedge against the futures 
market. In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index 
rose 72.6 points, or 1.26 percent, to close at 5,827.9 points. Some 
traders attributed the gains to a Financial Times report that said 
U.S. oil giants Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are in an advanced stage 
of merger talks. Several European oil companies saw their shares benefit 
from the prospect of continued industry consolidation, led by the 
British-traded shares of Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos., which rose 
4 percent. British Petroleum, which stunned the industry in August 
with its $49 billion acquisition of Amoco Corp., also rose. Most other 
European markets rose, too. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX closed 2.3 percent 
higher, the Paris CAC-40 rose 1.7 percent and the main indexes in 
Milan and Madrid both rose 2.6 percent. Volume in most markets was 
light, as traders took cues from the United States, where markets 
were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.
