The clothes it sells are, mildly put, conservative. Its line in precooked 
food caters to everyone from brown-bag lunchers to dinner-party hosts 
too pressed to attend to the cuisine themselves. Marks &AMP; Spencer 
PLC is _ in other words _ dependable. Until now. For the last month, 
the venerable British retailer has been roiled by the unthinkable: 
an unseemly board room tussle aired in public after profits cascaded 
and the company stock plummeted. Britain's financial journals, moreover, 
gleefully picked over what they called Marks &AMP; Spencer's parochialism 
and introverted management culture, criticizing as slow footed its 
effort to take its distinctive green-and-white storefront to a broader 
European market. The company's autocratic chairman, Sir Richard Greenbury, 
even flew back from India to halt disclosures about a power struggle 
over the succession to his job. Thursday, the company _ known affectionately 
to many in Britain as Marks and Sparks _ moved to stanch the bloodletting. 
After a board meeting that lasted into Wednesday night, Greenbury's 
heir apparent, Peter Salsbury, was named to succeed him, and an insurgent 
executive who had sought to usurp him was pressed into early retirement. 
Greenbury, 62 _ who had been both chairman and chief executive _ was 
seen as having triumphed by securing the post of nonexecutive chairman 
until 2000. Salsbury, 49, will be the new chief executive beginning 
in February. The deputy chairman, Keith Oates, 56, will retire in 
January after 15 years with the company. The markets were not impressed. 
Shares of Marks &AMP; Spencer, which have underperformed the London 
Stock Exchange blue-chip index all year, fell 21 pence Thursday, to 
425 pence, reflecting investors' assessments that the new chief executive 
might not be able to turn around the company's sliding fortunes. Profits 
fell 23 percent in the first half of 1998, the first drop in six years, 
and the decline apparently precipitated Oates' bid for the top job. 
The crisis in what has been known as Britain's most profitable retailer 
comes after criticism by outsiders who said the company had failed 
to introduce new ideas to remain competitive. Greenbury has been with 
the company since he joined it at 17. Salsbury is a Marks &AMP; Spencer 
lifer who joined after leaving the London School of Economics 28 years 
ago. According to analysts who spoke on the condition of anonymity, 
Oates _ with only 14 years at the company _ was seen as a newcomer 
with a background in finance rather than retailing. Marks &AMP; Spencer 
pioneered the sale of pre-prepared food for the upscale market in 
its stores, only to be challenged by other mass market retailers like 
Tesco and Sainsbury. It bought Brooks Brothers in the United States, 
but though the acquisition introduced button-down Oxford-cloth shirts 
to a British mass market, it has lost money. A global expansion plan 
valued at $3.7 billion was announced last year, just as consumer demand 
was about to falter. And Greenbury insisted on a high level of British 
content in his products, which made them expensive in Continental 
Europe. The woes escalated this month when Oates, the deputy chairman, 
sensed he would be passed over for promotion to the top job when Greenbury 
divided his titles _ a move that initially had been scheduled for 
next May. According to reports in the British media, Oates appealed 
to nonexecutive board members for support. That brought Greenbury 
flying back from a vacation in India to put down the revolt and defend 
his management style. ``I'm not an ogre,'' he said. ``I'm blunt and 
I'm competitive.'' Oates said Thursday that he was ``disappointed 
to be retiring early from Marks &AMP; Spencer.'' And Greenbury said 
it was ``very sad that as part of the modernizing of our top management 
structure, there is no longer a full-time role for Keith.''
