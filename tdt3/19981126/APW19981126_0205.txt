A cease-fire committee on Thursday halted five days of sporadic fighting 
between soldiers and Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines that 
left at least five people dead and 23 wounded. The committee, headed 
by a Roman Catholic priest and military and Muslim rebel representatives, 
went to the battle site near the town of Datu Piang in Maguindanao 
province to prevent the fighting from escalating. It ordered the two 
sides to maintain a distance of five kilometers (three miles), which 
was agreed upon during earlier talks. ``It's quiet now and fighting 
has stopped,'' said army battalion spokesman Capt. Onting Alon. ``We 
will remain on guard because the enemy is still around. It is too 
early to say it is safe.'' Each side accuses the other of starting 
the fighting, which began Saturday. It led to fierce exchanges of 
mortar and automatic weapons fire in sporadic clashes that spread 
to three towns in Maguindanao, 910 kilometers (570 miles) southeast 
of Manila. Maj. Gen. Rolando Bautista, the army's area commander, 
said stray bullets killed a woman visiting a nearby ranch Tuesday 
in Datu Piang and an old man Wednesday in nearby Sharif Aguak town. 
Bautista said soldiers recovered the body of a Muslim rebel and that 
18 soldiers were wounded in the fighting. He said the rebels took 
20 civilians hostage in a village Tuesday to prevent soldiers from 
attacking their positions, and continued to hold them. Al-haj Murad, 
spokesman for the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front, said two other 
rebels died and five were wounded. Bautista said the rebels were trying 
to expand areas under their control and the military was holding them 
back. But Shariff Julabbi, an MILF spokesman, accused government troops 
of starting the fighting by bombarding rebel positions with 105mm 
howitzers. He said the rebels retaliated with mortar fire. Muslim 
rebels claim they have 48 camps, including 13 strongholds, in southern 
Mindanao, the country's second largest island, but the government 
has yet to recognize any of these camps. The fighting closed a road 
linking Cotabato to the nearby city of General Santos, a major fishing 
port. The MILF is the bigger of two Muslim rebel groups still fighting 
the government. The main rebel group, the Moro National Liberation 
Front, signed a peace pact with the government in September 1996.
