China and Japan have hailed the beginning of a new stage in their 
relations. Visiting Chinese President, Jeing Ze Minh met Thursday 
with Japanese Kazuo Obuchi. The two issued a communique agreeing to 
enhance cooperation, but the two countries failed to emerge completely 
from the shadow of their war time past. The Chinese had wanted Japan 
to formally apologize for its war time atrocities. But in their joint 
statement, it did not contain the word, Apology. Instead it spoke 
of Japan's deep remorse.
