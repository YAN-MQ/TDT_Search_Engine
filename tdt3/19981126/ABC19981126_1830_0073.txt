Good evening. And happy Thanksgiving. We are going to start tonight 
in Russia, with an alarming piece of evidence about the decaying state 
of its military. A top Russian general is now saying that nearly 60% 
of the intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, in the Russian 
arsenal have surpassed their recommended shelf life, and are now unreliable. 
Many of them are loaded with nuclear warheads. Russia has more nuclear 
warheads than the rest of the world combined, and now there is almost 
no money to maintain the missiles that carry them. Here's ABC's Jim 
Wooten. It isn't just the Rockets the general's worried about, but 
the rest of Russia's nuclear strike system as well, from launch sites 
on the ground to surveillance satellites in orbit. In today's "red 
star", the military's daily paper, Anatoly perminov warns that age 
and a lack of funds for modernization have destabilized his country's 
nuclear arsenal. Intelligence sources say two Russian Rockets, probably 
with little or no maintenance, have already exploded inside their 
silos in the past six months. Unlike the United States, where the 
shelf-life of weapons is routinely extended, the Russians just don't 
have the technology or the money to keep theirs from deteriorating. 
And there's little promise that either the know-how or the funds will 
soon be available. So today's warning from the commander of all missile 
forces here, he's the general down there at the end of the line, was 
a clear signal that the military supports start two, a treaty with 
the U.S. that would reduce both countries' nuclear weapons by half. 
It was signed by presidents Yeltsin and bush nearly six years ago 
and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, but the Duma, the Russian 
parliament dominated by communists, has balked. Too expensive to dismantle 
weapons, like this, they say, and too dangerous as well. Now, the 
Russian military is saying, do it anyway. Obviously if they got rid 
of these older missiles, it would be cheaper and better and safer 
for them and probably for us in the west as well, although it might 
give them some money to go for a new generation of ballistic missiles, 
and then we start to look at all sorts of arms-control limitation 
problems again. That's the bad news. What the general and the Russian 
military want is to use start two and any savings to deploy this new 
advanced missile, the topol-M, designed to be invisible to radar.
