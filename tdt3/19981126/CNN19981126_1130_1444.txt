Garth Brooks says he's more proud for country music than he is for 
himself. According to his label, the country music star's latest album, 
"double live," broke all sales records, selling more than 1.085 million 
copies in its debut week. That beats the old sales record set by pearl 
jam five years ago. The recording industry association of America 
says Brooks is the biggest selling artist in U.S. music history with 
career sales of 83 million units.
