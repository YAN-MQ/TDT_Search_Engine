A pre-dawn fire swept through a three-story apartment building in 
northeast Bahrain, forcing some 300 Asian workers to flee, a newspaper 
reported Thursday. There were no injuries as a result of the Wednesday 
fire in Muharraq, northeast of the capital, Manama, the English-language 
Gulf Daily News reported. Police were investigating the cause of the 
fire, the paper said. Shiite Muslim activists campaigning for political 
and social reforms have been blamed for numerous arson attacks in 
the country. More than 40 people have been killed since the campaign 
began in 1994. Many of the victims have been Asian workers. Activists 
have accused the Asians of taking away jobs from local workers and 
of being police informers. At least 300 Asians, including Indian and 
Bangladeshi laborers, resided in the three-story building that was 
the site of Wednesday's fire. Shiites form a slight majority of Bahrain's 
400,000 citizens, but the Gulf state is ruled by the Al Khalifa family, 
which belongs to the mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.
