President Pierre Buyoya said he will urge other African leaders to 
help him persuade neighboring countries to lift economic sanctions 
against Burundi. ``The support of many heads of state is already there,'' 
Buyoya said Wednesday before departing for a two-day summit of African 
leaders that opened Thursday in Paris. But Burundi's neighbors have 
repeatedly refused to lift the sanctions they imposed against the 
retired army major less than a week after he overthrew a weak coalition 
government on July 25, 1996. The seven countries want to force Buyoya 
to restore democratic institutions, which he has partially done, and 
to share power with the Hutu majority. Hutu rebels are fighting to 
topple Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi minority, which accounts for 
14 percent of Burundi's population of 6 million. Hutus account for 
85 percent. More than 200,000 people have been killed since 1993 when 
violence erupted in the East African nation after Tutsi paratroopers 
killed the country's first democratically elected president, a Hutu.
