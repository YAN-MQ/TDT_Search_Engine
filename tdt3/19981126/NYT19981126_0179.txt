Two Republican members of the House committee that handles the budget 
of the District of Columbia have asked a federal prosecutor to investigate 
the use of local money to pay for abortions. Congress stipulated in 
1993 that the district could not use local money to provide abortions 
to poor women, but district officials acknowledge that the practice 
continued until last month, when a financial control board official 
noticed the restriction in the latest appropriations act. In a letter 
to Wilma Lewis, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Reps. 
Todd Tiahrt of Kansas and Robert Aderholt of Alabama, wrote: ``We 
are outraged that officials and employees of the District of Columbia 
government have feigned ignorance to justify their blatant violation 
of federal law.'' Ms. Lewis would not comment on the investigation. 
District officials acknowledge that the abortion ban had been overlooked, 
even though it consistently appeared in appropriation bills and those 
measures were widely covered in local newspapers. ``All evidence thus 
far indicates that this was an administrative snafu, pure and simple,'' 
said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate in 
the House. ``This occurred during a time when the district was flat 
on its back _ it's only now recovering _ from a financial and management 
crisis.'' Ms. Norton said she was confident that officials in the 
district had always meant to scrupulously follow the laws enacted 
by Congress, even though some have resented measures that undermined 
local policy. In the last two years, the district has spent $202,000 
to pay for 756 abortions. Many of the women who had abortions were 
on welfare and were advised to apply for money from the Medical Charities 
Program, officials said. In 1996, 13,674 abortions were performed 
in the District of Columbia, 6,771 of them reported as being for district 
residents. The Medical Charities Program, which does not rely on federal 
funds, is financed from property and income taxes. The fund helps 
poor residents of Washington pay medical bills if they are not covered 
by Medicaid, or if they are ineligible for Medicaid because they are 
childless or able-bodied. Federal policy prohibits Medicaid _ health 
insurance programs for the poor and disabled that are financed by 
federal and state governments _ from paying for abortions except in 
cases when the mother's life is in danger or in cases of incest or 
rape. States are free to use local tax money to pay for abortions. 
Paul Offner, the district commissioner of health care finance, whose 
office oversees the Medical Charities Program, complained that the 
abortion rule was an example of Congress telling the city what to 
do with its own money. Last month, Congress also barred the use of 
federal or district money to pay for needle-exchange programs, which 
have been active in the city for several years.
