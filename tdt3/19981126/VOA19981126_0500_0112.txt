Japan and China will issue a joint statement following talks between 
their top leaders but will not sign it. As we hear from VOA's Roger 
Wilkinson the decision not to sign the statement cast a poll on China's 
President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan. And the two nations hopes 
for improved ties. Japanese media reported earlier Thursday that Japan 
and China cancelled the signing ceremony because Beijing is angered 
by Tokyo's refusal to issue a forthright written apology to China 
for its war crimes there in 1930's and 1940's. Now, a Japanese official 
who asked not to be identified says the signing ceremony was never 
formally scheduled. He also denies that the decision not to sign the 
statement is related to its content. Japan plans to issue an oral 
apology for it's wartime atrocities in China. But the statement to 
be issued after the summit between President Jung and Japanese Prime 
Minister Keizo Obuchi will only include Mr. Obuchi's expression of 
deep remorse over Japan's wartime atrocities in China. Chinese official 
has no comment on the diplomatic boo-ha-ha saying only that everything 
will be cleared up after the summit. Roger Wilkinson, VOA News, Tokyo.
