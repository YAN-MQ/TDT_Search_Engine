The first ascent of north America's tallest mountain may have been 
a hoax. "The New York Times" reports, researcher Robert Bryce has 
found evidence the photograph of the 1906 expedition up Alaska's Mt. 
McKinley was cropped. He says a print from the original Negative, 
taken by Dr. Frederick cook, shows geographical surroundings that 
indicate cook was actually 15,000 feet below the summit at a place 
critics have dubbed fake peak. Bryce says he believes cook never intended 
to go all the way to the top.
