The pacific northwest is recovering from its second strong storm system 
in three days. Heavy rain and strong winds set off mud slides, toppled 
trees, blew over mobile homes, and left many residents without power. 
Flood watches are in effect for several of Oregon's coastal counties. 
The rain should continue through this afternoon.
