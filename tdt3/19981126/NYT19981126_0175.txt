Leon M. Singer is 70 and has no delusions of immortality. Nonetheless, 
Singer, a retired businessman who lives in Great Neck, N.Y., has created 
a Roth IRA that should be paying out tax-free income until 2073. The 
beneficiaries are his granddaughters, Alexis Gertler, who is 6, and 
her sister Shelley, 3. ``I had no idea of the magnitude of the potential 
benefit of converting my traditional IRA to a Roth IRA with my grandchildren 
as beneficiaries until I attended a seminar at a bookstore,'' said 
Singer, a widower. The seminar was held by Seymour and Jason Goldberg, 
father-and-son tax lawyers and accountants in Garden City, N.Y. ``They 
tuned me on to the differences that started a ball rolling,'' Singer 
said, ``and I attempted to educate myself to learn whatever was required 
to take advantage of the Roth.'' Singer has put $65,000 into a trust 
for each girl. Assuming that he lives another 10 years, and the Roth 
earns 8 percent annually, each girl would receive $2,339 in income 
from her trust the first year after he dies. And each will collect 
more than $4.2 million, tax-free, before their accounts must be emptied 
under tax rules in 2073. Earning 10 percent, each girl would collect 
$11.5 million. ``Paying the taxes now is a sacrifice for me, but not 
a very great one, because I believe I can do without that money,'' 
Singer said. ``The advantages are so enormous that anybody who can 
do this and doesn't is making a mistake.'' --- It was a remark by 
his father, a retired Chicago police sergeant, that prompted Leon 
C. Blair, 23, to put $2,000 into a Roth IRA. ``My father told me he 
wished he had started saving when he was young, because he'd be a 
lot better off now,'' said Blair, who attends college and works full-time 
as a human resources consultant for the Chicago Park District. His 
dad's comment prompted Blair to read ``Pay Yourself First,'' a book 
by Jesse Brown, a member of his church who runs Krystal Investment 
Management, a financial advice firm in Chicago. Blair and his father, 
also named Leon, attended a seminar conducted by Brown, who explained 
how compound interest, over time, makes money grow almost magically. 
Besides opening a Roth _ investing the money in a mutual fund recommended 
by Brown _ Blair began putting $100 a month into a taxable account 
in another mutual fund. The saving forced a change in the young man's 
life style. ``I love to go out and have a good time, but I am in the 
process of learning how to manage my money,'' Blair said. ``I am learning 
to bite the bullet. I have run up credit card debts in the past. Now 
I'm paying off my debt. The money I am investing I would just blow 
going to the show or chasing girls _ and I still do, just a little 
less now.'' If Blair puts $2,000 into his Roth IRA every year until 
he is 65, he will have saved $86,000. But if his money earns an 8 
percent average annual return, his account will be worth worth more 
than $700,000, all of it tax-free. If he earns 10 percent, he will 
have $1.25 million. And if he keeps making $100 monthly investments 
in his taxable account, an 8 percent return will give him an additional 
$259,366, even after he pays taxes on the capital gains. --- When 
Dale E. Schmidt retired six years ago as inventory manager at a Nebraska 
factory that makes cough syrup, he rolled his retirement nest egg 
into an Individual Retirement Account. Last February, sold on the 
benefits of the Roth IRA, he moved a chunk of his savings into two 
Roths. But in October, when the value of the stocks in one of his 
new accounts plummeted, Schmidt feared that he had made a terrible 
mistake. The conversion of his traditional IRA meant he faced paying 
taxes this coming April on money he no longer had. ``I put in $89,000 
in one Roth, and it dropped to $73,000,'' Schmidt said. ``I thought: 
`Oh, my goodness, I don't feel very comfortable. What a disaster.' 
'' Schmidt turned for help to Bob FitzSimmons, a certified financial 
planner in Lincoln, Neb. FitzSimmons had his client undo the slumping 
Roth by putting the money back into a traditional IRA and then rolling 
it back into another new Roth account. Under Internal Revenue Service 
rules, the conversion is valued for tax purposes at the lower figure. 
``That advice saved me taxes on $15,000,'' Schmidt said. ``It's been 
a month since I reconverted and, by golly, that Roth's back to $87,000, 
so I did well with that.'' People whose Roth accounts have dropped 
in value can reconvert once before the end of the year to cut their 
taxes. And people who convert to Roths next year will also be allowed 
one reconversion. The IRS plans a permanent rule governing reconversions 
for 2000 and beyond. --- Money in Roth IRAs can be withdrawn tax-free 
after the saver is 59{. That rule can help people who become parents 
in middle age _ like Kenneth O'Hare and Denise Zaccardi _ save for 
their children's college education. O'Hare, 56, will be in his early 
60s when Rose Erin, his 11-year-old daughter, starts college. And 
when their son, Miles, 7, finishes high school, Ms. Zaccardi, 50, 
will also be eligible for tax-free withdrawals. ``I read about all 
these new savings vehicles in the 1997 tax law,'' said O'Hare, chief 
executive of Millennia Consulting in Chicago, which evaluates programs 
for foundations and other nonprofit organizations. ``I avoided them, 
because a quick reading of what was in the newspaper made it all sound 
pretty complicated. And who wanted to fool around with the paperwork? 
Frankly, I was not impressed with the Roth IRA.'' Then O'Hare talked 
to Ron Freund, his financial adviser at Social Equity Group in Berkeley, 
Calif., about ways to finance college for the children. Freund noted 
that by using the new Education IRA, each parent could set aside $500 
a child _ a total of $2,000 annually. But with the Roth IRA, each 
parent could set aside $2,000, doubling their tax-advantaged savings. 
The Roth has another advantage. College-aid formulas count money in 
a student's accounts, including Education IRAs, but not savings in 
a parent's Roth IRA, said Cynthia Rife, director of student awards 
at Stanford University's financial aid office. Weighing all the information, 
the O'Hares each have decided to establish a Roth account by year-end.
