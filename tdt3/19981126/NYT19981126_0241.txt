Earl Kim, a composer whose music valued economy, precision and quietude, 
and who was an important mentor to younger composers during a 23-year 
career at Harvard University, died Nov. 19 at his home in Cambridge, 
Mass. He was 78. He had recently been diagnosed with cancer, his family 
said. Kim received the most public attention for works he wrote for 
the violinist Itzhak Perlman, which were were somewhat out of character 
for the composer. In 1979 Perlman gave the premiere of Kim's Violin 
Concerto with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall. Though 
a compact, 20-minute, one-movement piece, the concerto teems with 
an almost romantic lyricism and brilliant writing for the violin. 
Following this, Kim composed a set of dazzling violin caprices for 
Perlman that have become popular with many violinists. But for the 
most part, Kim's music was modest of statement and infrequently heard 
outside contemporary and chamber music circles. He was a modernist 
in the sense that his musical language was steeped in contemporary 
procedures, including touches of the 12-tone idiom. But his voice 
was deeply personal: aristocratic, restrained, with not a note wasted. 
Kim was especially admired for his vocal works. Versed in several 
languages, he selected texts of distinction by authors like Baudelaire, 
Rimbaud, Rilke, Anne Sexton and, his favorite, Samuel Beckett. The 
spareness, abstraction and mystery in Beckett's writing was reflected 
tellingly in Kim's many musical settings, including ``Exercises en 
Route'' and ``Earthlight.'' Some of Kim's vocal works use the singing 
voice traditionally. But he was especially noted for his melodramas, 
in which the words are spoken or quasi-sung, accompanied by spare 
instrumental gestures. Bethany Beardslee and Benita Valente were among 
the singers who championed Kim's vocal music, and Dawn Upshaw took 
the title of her album ``The Girl With Orange Lips'' from one of the 
songs in his cycle ``Where Grief Slumbers.'' Kim was born in Dinuba, 
Calif., on Jan. 6, 1920. In 1939, he began studies in composition 
at the University of California at Los Angeles with Schoenberg; the 
following year he transferred to Berkeley, where he worked with Ernest 
Bloch. From 1952 to 1967, he taught at Princeton. He then accepted 
a position at Harvard, eventually becoming James Edward Ditson professor 
of music. He retired in 1990. Kim was active in political causes. 
In 1983, as president of Musicians Against Nuclear Arms, he participated 
in a concert at Avery Fisher Hall to raise funds for Physicians for 
Social Responsibility. In 1990, he refused an invitation to join a 
music panel of the National Endowment for the Arts to express his 
opposition to ``all forms of censorship of the arts,'' as he wrote 
in a letter published in The New York Times. He is survived by his 
wife, Martha Potter, a violinist; a daughter, Eva, of Cambridge, and 
a daughter from a previous marriage, Shawna Kent of New York. Kim's 
last major work, ``The White Hour'' for chamber orchestra, was given 
its premiere this year by the Boston Chamber Music Society.
