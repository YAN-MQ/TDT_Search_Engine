The death toll is climbing following a collision between two trains 
this morning in India. At least 92 people are dead and 141 others 
injured after seven cars from one train jumped the tracks. Another 
train on a parallel track slammed into the derailed cars. 1,700 passengers 
were on both trains. The collision has been called India's worst train 
crash in the past three years.
