Nearly 7,000 American soldiers spent Thanksgiving Day writing letters, 
sending e-mail to their loved ones and enjoying turkey and apple pie 
7,000 miles away from home. Many of the troops, who are stationed 
in Bosnia as part of a NATO-led international peacekeeping force, 
had mixed feelings about spending the holiday so far from home. ``The 
soldiers are sad to be away of their families, but they are here on 
a noble mission and they are very proud to be part of that,'' said 
Maj. Gen. Kevin Byrnes, Cmdr. Multinational Division North. Although 
they were far from home, the decorated dining facilities tried to 
create the feel of Thanksgiving back in the United States. Troops 
heaping their plates could feast on a traditional turkey dinner and 
count their blessings. ``I miss my parents, but I have a lot of things 
to be thankful for,'' said Capt. Dia Logan, 30, of Boise, Idaho. ``And 
I feel as additional benefit to be in Bosnia on a peacekeeping mission.'' 
Marking the holiday, American Forces Network-Europe (AFN) radio station 
based in Frankfurt, Germany traveled to Eagle Base to open AFN-Bosnia. 
The station, to be based in Taszar, Hungary and share the airwaves 
with its partner AFN-Hungary, will broadcast to more than 10,000 U.S. 
troops deployed in Hungary and Bosnia, as well as Macedonia and Croatia. 
``We're American radio for the American peacekeepers, spreading the 
word and music to those who keep the peace,'' said Bill Johnson-Miles, 
AFN-Bosnia station manager. American singers and bands _ Lari White 
and ``Galaxy'' _ traveled to a few U.S. military bases in Bosnia, 
trying to bring the sounds of home. ``Everyone like different things 
for Thanksgiving. For me, without egg eggnog it is not Thanksgiving 
Day, ``said Lt. Colonel Stephen Kerrick,49, of Lansing, Kansas. Along 
with the traditional feast of grilled turkey, glazed baked ham, candied 
sweet potatoes and apple pie, there was eggnog too _ but without alcohol.
