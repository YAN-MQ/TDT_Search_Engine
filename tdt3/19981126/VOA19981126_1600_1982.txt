Israel says it will review its troops presence in Lebanon following 
and upsurge in casualties from Guerrillas attacks in the occupied 
border strip. The two Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday night 
by a bomb planted by Hezbollah guerrillas. Three Israeli soldiers 
were killed last week. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says 
Israel will not leave Lebanon until it is sure of two things: that 
the region won't be a base for attacks, and that Israel's local militia 
allies will be safe.
