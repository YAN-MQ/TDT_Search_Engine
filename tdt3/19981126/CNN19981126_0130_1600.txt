The executive editor of "spin" magazine, Craig marks, says he was 
assaulted by bodyguards for musical artist Marilyn manson. Marks says 
he was invited backstage after a manson performance in New York and 
during their conversation, manson boasted of being able to kill him, 
his family and everyone he knows. Marks says that's when bodyguards 
grabbed him by the neck and shoved him against a wall. Marks was treated 
for bruises and reported the incident to police. So far, there's been 
no comment from manson.
