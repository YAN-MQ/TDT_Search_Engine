the international conflict over Augusto Pinochet continued today after 
yesterday's ruling by Britain's highest court that the former Chilean 
dictator is not immune from prosecution. British Home Secretary Jack 
Straw has asked for a one week extension of the deadline for him to 
make a decision on whether the 83-year-old general should be sent 
home to Chile or extradited to Spain. NPR's Michael Goldfarb reports. 
From the time that the police in London arrested Augusto Pinochet 
in his hospital bed, Jack Straw has made it very clear that his inclination 
is to let the judicial process take its full course. Now we've already 
had two separate visits to the courts to discuss the situation. Pinochet's 
lawyers went to a court to have the arrest voided, and the court agreed 
with Pinochet's lawyers. The Britain's supreme court, listening to 
the British government on appeal, said, no, no, Pinochet must stay 
under arrest, and the extradition proceedings must go on. So there's 
a way to go yet, and the only public pronouncement so far from Straw 
is that his inclination is to let the judicial process take its course, 
and he will not intervene. NPR's Michael Goldfarb reporting from London.
