two Israeli soldiers have been killed in a road side bomb blast in 
South Lebanon, inside the Israeli controlled zone. In Beirut, the 
pro Iranian Hezbollah Guerilla Group claimed responsibility for the 
attack. The bomb was apparently detonated by remote control, as an 
Israeli troop patrol passed by. Israeli forces retaliated by firing 
artillery shells at suspected gorilla hideouts near the area.
