China is another traditionally thin culture. And maybe one explanation 
is the popularity of foods like pickled tuber. VOA correspondent Stephanie 
Ho has more from Beijing. Chinese people love to eat. But with no 
surprise, that the Fu Ling, Chong Ching municipality chose to honor 
a food product during a recent ceremony. Banners were hung hailing 
the 100th anniversary of the production of a pickled tuber known as 
Ja Tai. There was even a sort of mascot, a round green tuber as the 
smiling head of a character whose arm was waved in a perpetual wave. 
At another ceremony in honor of Ja Tai, hundreds of children dressed 
in red, yellow and green costumes braved rain showers to wave colored 
hoops and gold spangles. The Ja in Ja Tai means to press or to extract, 
which refers to the process of squeezing out all of the tubers juice. 
Bran Chulai of the Fu Ling Foreign Information Office says families 
in the last century had leftovers of the tuber and so figured out 
a way to preserve it. or as a kind of sauce. Fu Ling resident, Clara 
Wang says Ja Tai is a regular part of her breakfast. I east it every 
day in the morning. Clara says her favorite is the spicy kind. I think 
its quite exciting food. You sweat after you eat those spicy ones. 
Local simply taste better, a fact that authorities hope will bring 
in more investments and more tourists. VOA correspondent Stephanie 
Ho in Beijing. Obesity and affluence was the subject examined on today's 
addition of Dateline. I'm Carolyn Weaver.
