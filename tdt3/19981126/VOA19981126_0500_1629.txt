Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two minute break. Don't go away, though. We'll be back with more 
of VOA News now. November 26, 1998 it is. Looking back in history 
on this date. In 1832, New York City began the nation's first mass 
transit program with the inaugural service of streetcars. Nordstrom 
trolley's similar to those in Paris rode on wooden wheels and could 
carry up to thirty passengers. Within a few years time, rails were 
installed in the streets and the trolley's were fitted with wheels 
that could roll on the rails. This provided a smoother ride for passengers 
and permitted horses to pull a heavier load. The city-run service 
charged about a twelve cent fare. Streetcars proved so popular that 
routes were established all over the city. Streetcar systems soon 
became the benchmark by which American cities were rated. By 1900, 
there were nearly thirty two thousand kilometers of streetcar tracks 
in the United States. By World War I, the number had grown to seventy-two 
thousand kilometers of tracks. On November 26, 1922, cartoonist Charles 
Shultz was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Shultz is known for a comic 
strip about children, Peanuts. It's characters such as Charlie Brown, 
Lucy, Linus, and the dog, Snoopy, talk like adults. Schultz wanted 
to be a cartoonist from an early age. He had little formal art training. 
The correspondence course given by Minneapolis Art School mainly. 
1948, the "Saturday Evening Post" Magazine published some of Shultz's 
work then in 1950, the United Feature Syndicate bought a comic strip 
called Will Folks and distributed under the name Peanuts. Peanuts 
now is published by newspapers all over the world in many languages 
every day of the week. It is eight hours thirty, Universal Time. And 
this is VOA News Now. At least one hundred people are dead in India 
as a result of a train accident. A dispute erupts over the Japan-China 
summit over a planned apology for wartime atrocities. Former Chile 
dictator Augusto Pinochet loses his appeal for freedom. Those stories 
plus business news and more in the next half hour of VOA News Now. 
Hello again, everyone. I'm Paul Westfeeling broadcasting live from 
Studio 29 in Washington.
