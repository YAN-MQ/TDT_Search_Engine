Russia has told Western bankers that it will renege on the terms of 
repaying $28 billion in Soviet-era debt to creditors, effectively 
paving the way for a default on interest payments next month, bankers 
said here Thursday. The Russian position emerged from three days of 
negotiations this week between Russian officials and the so-called 
London Club, a loose assembly of more than 600 Western creditors. 
It is the latest setback for Russia, which has already announced its 
intention to renegotiate foreign loans. The country is facing a collapsing 
currency, a yawning budget deficit and a deteriorating economy. The 
thrust of the discussions, according to Russian officials and Western 
bankers, was that Russia would not meet previously agreed terms to 
pay half of a $724 million interest payment, due this coming Wednesday, 
in cash and has offered instead to pay in bonds worth only about 13 
percent of their face value. In a further sign of trouble, bankers, 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said separate negotiations 
on $10 billion in ruble-denominated domestic debt owed to foreigners 
had divided Western creditors over whether to accept new Russian terms 
or not. ``The issue is whether they should give any form of acknowledgment 
or not'' when a committee of 18 banks meets here Friday to discuss 
the Russian offer, a banker said. ``No one feels there's been much 
achievement.'' Russia announced a moratorium on debt Aug. 17 and devalued 
the ruble by 34 percent. Since then, it has failed to reach agreement 
with the International Monetary Fund on what economic policies it 
will undertake in exchange for the IMF's freeing $4.3 billion of a 
$22.6 billion loan. And Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov has 
signaled deepening troubles by saying Russia will be able to pay back 
less than $10 billion of the $17 billion in foreign debt that falls 
due in 1999. Michel Camdessus, the head of the IMF, has agreed to 
visit Moscow next week to discuss Russia's economic crisis, Russian 
officials said Thursday. The negotiations with the London Club had 
centered on terms agreed to in 1997 that set out a schedule of repayments 
of debts from the former Soviet Union that have principal denominated 
in principal bonds _ known as PRINs. Under the 1997 agreement, half 
of the interest due Wednesday was to be paid in cash and half in bonds 
called interest arrears notes, or IANs. Instead, Russia wants to pay 
the whole $724 million by issuing new IANs. Under the terms of the 
1997 deal, Russia has a 15 business-day grace period to meet its obligations, 
but bankers remained skeptical that creditors and investors holding 
IANs could be reached for their approval of Moscow's interest repayment 
proposals. To fulfill earlier agreements, 75 percent to 95 percent 
of creditors must agree to accept payment in new paper, but most of 
the holders of IANs are thought to be dispersed. Russian officials 
maintain that a separate interest payment of $216 million will be 
repaid in cash, but a London Club statement did not confirm this. 
And while Kasyanov said Thursday that London Club negotiations had 
agreed in principle to accept the whole Dec. 2 interest payment in 
IANs, bankers said creditors had not agreed. ``To most lay people, 
it's definitely a default,'' said a banker who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. ``They are not going to pay. We are not even at the 
due date, and they have already announced that they are not going 
to pay, and they are trying to get the creditors to accept that.'' 
However, he said, `'it won't be considered a default until late December 
because of the 15-day grace period.'' In separate discussions, Russian 
officials have offered a complicated mix of repayments of $10 billion 
in domestic ruble debt that was part of the $40 billion Treasury debt 
frozen last August. Effectively, though, the Russian offer would permit 
foreign creditors to repatriate only $550 million, staggered over 
a year of monthly central bank auctions. The rest would be swapped 
for a variety of ruble securities useful only for transactions inside 
Russia. A negotiating committee led by Deutsche Bank AG and Credit 
Suisse First Boston is to present the Russian proposal to a larger 
banking group Friday, but some of those close to the discussions said 
there was little unanimity among the creditors about the value of 
the deal. ``It's not that anybody thinks that the Russians could have 
been moved more'' in the negotiations, said one banker close to the 
discussions. ``It's a question of whether it's worth reacting to it.'' 
Konstantin Korishchenko, a senior Russian Central Bank official, said 
Thursday that the offer was the best available. ``Investors could 
not ask for more than we offered because there was no way we could 
improve conditions of the swap,'' he told Bridge News.
