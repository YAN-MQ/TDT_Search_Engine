Several fans among the thousands waiting to buy tickets for a weekend 
soccer match that could decide the season championship scuffled with 
one another and police Thursday. Twelve people were injured and 11 
arrested, authorities said. Many of the nearly 10,000 people who lined 
up outside the Boca Juniors' stadium arrived Monday, hoping for a 
chance to watch their team play Sunday against Independiente. A Boca 
tie or win would give Diego Maradona's former club team its first 
Argentine championship since 1992. As time drew near for the 12,000 
tickets priced at dlrs 10 to be put on sale Thursday, fans began pushing 
and shoving among themselves and later with police who tried to maintain 
order. Annoyed with the more than 300 police officers surrounding 
the stadium, fans began throwing bottles, rocks and sticks at the 
officers, who were armed with batons. Meanwhile, Gustavo Correa, the 
fan lucky enough to be at the head of the line, held firmly onto his 
spot. ``My dear Boca....the champion,'' he shouted after buying the 
first ticket. He will be among the more than 62,000 fans expected 
to fill Boca's La Bombonera stadium Sunday.
