Preparations are under way for the Macy's day parade. The horrifying 
mishap last year forced officials to make new rules for this year. 
We have a report. It was not the first balloon accident, but it was, 
by far, the worst. The cat in the hat careened into a lamp post, snapping 
off a five-foot iron cross-section. It came crashing down on a young 
mother, fracturing her skull. Sometimes it takes an accident, an unfortunate 
accident, to focus attention. That accident, from which the woman 
is still recovering, spurred New York City to create a task force 
to review the Macy's Thanksgiving day parade. It set new safety guidelines, 
including the possibility of grounding the balloons completely this 
year if it gets too windy. Macy's says parade viewers will see smaller 
balloons tethered to cars so they're not blown off course, like the 
quik bunny was last year. You got it! Lean forward, lean forward! 
There will be more balloon handlers. And they've been better trained, 
Macy's says, to keep the balloons from spinning out of control. Though 
if that does happen, a police official, now specially assigned, will 
decide whether to let the air out of the balloon. What is critical 
is that we have gone forward to make the necessary enhancements to 
the program. The biggest variable is wind, which parade organizers 
say will be monitored at every street corner. The gustier it gets, 
the lower the balloons will fly. Wind over 34 miles an hour, slightly 
less than last year, will ground the balloons. As for the lampposts, 
Macy's shared the cost with the city to have the old ones removed 
and replaced with safer models that don't extend over the street. 
Four balloons will no longer be seen on the historic parade route. 
The cat in the hat is out. Woody woodpecker, wounded in action, has 
retired, as has izzy the Olympic mascot, and the pink panther, which 
sadly limped along last year. Despite the changes, Macy's is promising 
the parade will rival those of years past. They plan to unveil three 
new balloons, all of which will meet the new standards. Deborah feyerick,
