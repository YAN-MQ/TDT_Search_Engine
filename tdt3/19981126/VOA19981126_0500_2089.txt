Chilean President, Eduardo Frey is sending his foreign minister to 
London in an effort to prevent the extradition of former Chilean Dictator, 
Augusto Pinochet to Spain. Mr. Free told the nation Wednesday, that 
the decision by a British Court to deny the 83 year old General immunity 
from prosecution is not the end of the battle. A panel of the British 
House of Lords, the nations highest court, ruled Wednesday that Former 
Chilean Dictator Pinochet does not have immunity from prosecution 
for crimes committed when he was in power. Chile's former military 
leader was arrested last month in London on a Spanish charging him 
with the crimes committed when he was head of state.
