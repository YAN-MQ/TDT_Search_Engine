I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
On this Thanksgiving day, it's pretty warm in a lot of locations, 
especially in the southwest. Forecast highs into the 80s in the plains. 
We'll see temperatures well into the 60s today. Coldest weather through 
the northern Great Lakes. Check your forecast weather maps -- a wet 
day in the northeast. It's gonna continue through much of the day 
today and on into early tomorrow. High pressure though building into 
the southeast. Another fine day of weather expected there. And we're 
looking for more wet weather along the west coast. That'll inching 
down the California coast by late tomorrow. The extended forecast 
shows rain into southern California, including Los angeles and San 
Diego, during the day on Saturday. We'll find snow as you head inland 
into the Rockies. And warm weather continues through much of the midwest, 
into the 60s, cities like Chicago and Milwaukee, and as far north 
as Minneapolis. On Sunday, showers will be scattered over the northern 
Great Lakes. We'll find rain again moving into the pacific northwest. 
Snow is expected inland there. Scattered showers expected along the 
Mississippi river valley during the day on Monday. For more weather
