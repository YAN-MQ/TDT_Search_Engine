I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"CNN Headline News" forecast. Lingering snow and rain in the northwest 
behind a winter storm system that caused very high winds along the 
west coast yesterday. Into the evening, that area of low pressure 
causing rain and snow in the northeast begins to push into Maine and 
southern Canada. The front associated with it pushes out to sea. While 
most of the nation will see beautiful weather, a dry front pushing 
into the Great Lakes by Friday evening, more snow and rain on the 
way for the northwest as a trough precedes another winter storm system 
into the northwestern U.S. high temperatures on Friday in the 30s 
for New England, the northern Rockies, otherwise, very warm in the 
south. 70s with 80s in southern Texas. Your extended forecast shows 
those warmer temperatures on Saturday. Rain and snow throughout the 
western third of the country. Windy in the northern plains. On Sunday, 
rain and snow in the northwest. Showers from the four corners region 
into Missouri with showers over the Great Lakes. On Monday, we'll 
see snow in the Great Lakes turning into showers. As you push toward 
the gulf coast, rain and snow continuing in the northwest. Remember, 
you can get your four-day forecast for more than 7,200 cities at cNN.com.
