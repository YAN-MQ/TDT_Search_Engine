Susan Lisovicz is standing by at our business newsdesk in New York 
to tell us what the outcome is. Susan? There's no sign that oil-producing 
countries are going to push oil prices up anytime soon, OPEC ministers 
ended their meeting in Vienna without any agreement at all to extend 
cuts in oil production. Some delegates had voiced hope that an earlier 
production cut would be extended until the end of 1999. But they were 
disappointed. Ministers agreed only to meet again in March. This comes 
as Exxon, the world's largest oil company, is reportedly in talks 
to buy mobil, the second-largest oil company in the United States. 
If completed, the deal would be the largest industrial merger ever 
and perhaps the largest of any kind. No price has been set yet, but 
a deal could come as early as next week.
