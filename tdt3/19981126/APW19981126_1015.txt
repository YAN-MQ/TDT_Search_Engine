Sounding on a theme for next year's elections, President Nelson Mandela 
on Thursday insisted the ruling African National Congress needs a 
two-thirds majority to accomplish its goals. Speaking at an annual 
gathering of foreign journalists, Mandela complained that traditional 
white ``Mickey Mouse'' parties are blocking the government's efforts 
at social transformation. With sharp rhetoric, the usually reconciliatory 
Mandela also lashed out at whites for dragging their feet and defending 
the privileges they had during apartheid that ended with 1994's first 
democratic ballot. ``We are crawling out of the traditions and institutions 
of apartheid (and) some opposition parties are opposing every effort 
to deliver services'' to previously disadvantaged nonwhites, Mandela 
said. A two-thirds majority for the ANC would enable it to change 
the country's new constitution. It was not clear which programs have 
been blocked, since the ANC has used its 60 percent vote in Parliament 
to push through all of its major legislation in the past four years. 
The opposition parties do not have enough votes to block the ANC initiatives. 
``We need two thirds majority to make sure we're not interfered with 
by Mickey Mouse parties,'' Mandela said. Mandela is retiring next 
year. His likely successor is Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. The National 
Party which ruled during apartheid and the Democratic Party are the 
leading opposition parties, and are supported mostly by whites. Mandela 
told the journalists he supported an initiative by the Human Rights 
Commission to investigate racism in the South African media. ``We 
hope it will contribute to understanding the extent to which racism 
plays a role in our every day lives,'' Mandela said. The investigation 
was triggered by a cllfoblc ofsial rpswobjcetorptigocorponb C fial
