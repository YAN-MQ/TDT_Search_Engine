Penny Cipolone's eighth-grade Latin students recently turned their 
classroom in Woodbury Heights, N.J., into a living hell. They covered 
the windows with black curtains, piped in dry-ice smoke and flashed 
red lights in their interpretation of Virgil's Underworld. That is 
about as close to dead as Latin gets these days. Once a tedious prep-school 
requirement endured with yawns, Latin was deemed by the curriculum 
reformers the subject least likely to survive the 1960s. Not only 
did it survive, it now continues to grow in high school enrollments, 
up more than 15 percent from 1990 to 1994, to a national total of 
189,000, according to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign 
Languages. In middle schools, meanwhile, the number of Latin students 
has tripled since the early 1980's. And some enterprising elementary 
schools were offering Latin to some 4,300 children as of 1994, up 
from 2,000 in 1990. Membership in the National Junior Classical League, 
a confederation of Latin clubs, has more than doubled since 1977, 
to more than 55,000. Students at state and national conventions don 
bedsheet togas, compete in ``Jeopardy''-style classics quizzes and 
eat grapes at Roman-style banquets. Part of what has attracted enrollments 
is a wholesale revamping of the way Latin courses are taught: students 
these days are as likely to learn about the lives of Pompeian teen-agers 
as to memorize the ablative case. ``It's not just, `Can you parse 
this sentence in the subjunctive?' '' said Mrs. Cipolone, who had 
36 Latin students when she began teaching 28 years ago and now has 
140. At the core of this renaissance _ after a period, beginning 35 
years ago, when Latin enrollment plunged _ is an enthusiastic community 
of scholars and devoted teachers like Mrs. Cipolone. They hold classics 
conventions, hand out pro-Latin fliers, put up billboards and generally 
do public relations for Latin. Kenneth Kitchell, a professor at the 
University of Massachusetts who has studied classics for 22 years, 
calls all this the Great Counteroffensive by Latin scholars. ``All 
of us are in the same ship, and about 20 years ago we realized the 
ship was the Titanic,'' Kitchell said. High school enrollments had 
dropped to 150,000 in the mid-1970s from more than 700,000 in the 
early 1960s. ``People just really woke up,'' the professor recalled, 
``and said it cannot continue to be the way it was.'' The big task 
was to make classics palatable to teen-agers. A crucial change was 
in textbooks. Where once a classical history text dealt with wars 
and conquerors, students now are more likely to use texts that discuss 
Roman family life. ``They tend to like stories about daily life and 
what it was like to be a teen-ager, instead of reading about Julius 
Caesar invading a country and slaughtering millions of people,'' said 
Ed Long, a high-school Latin teacher in Clarksville, Tenn. Teachers 
also began pointing to the ancient world as a paradigm of diversity. 
``Greco-Roman civilization is the archetypal multiculture,'' said 
Richard LaFleur, who heads the classics department at the University 
of Georgia. ``The Roman Empire included three continents. And the 
Romans, by and large, unlike Americans, were basically color-blind.'' 
Encouraged by studies of successful Latin programs in inner cities 
like those of Philadelphia and Los Angeles, educators began to write 
for the minority students who fill an increasing part of Latin classrooms. 
``Women and girls, Romans from the Near East and from Asia, black 
citizens of the Greco-Roman world, they all figure in these new text 
materials,'' said LaFleur, whose book ``Latin for the 21st Century'' 
(Scott Foresman Addison Wesley, 1998) describes trends in Latin education. 
Similarly, new textbooks highlight Spain's role in the Roman Empire, 
an appeal to Hispanic students, whose numbers in Latin classes are 
growing. ``They are the ones who have the edge,'' LaFleur said. ``They 
look at Latin and think that they're looking at their own language.'' 
American resistance to Latin is nothing new. As early as 1711, a group 
of Puritan parents protested its teaching at the Boston Latin School, 
calling it impractical. And the Revolutionary patriot Benjamin Rush 
maintained that the drudgery of the classics led to juvenile delinquency. 
But its defenders have been just as fierce in their loyalty. ``No 
one ever asks a mother why she ran back into a burning house to save 
her child,'' Kitchell said. ``For those of us who are really involved 
in promoting in a very aggressive way, it's just something you have 
to do.'' Peter Howard, who runs a teacher placement service for the 
American Classical League, a professional association, said the biggest 
challenge now was to keep enough Latin teachers to meet the demand. 
``The whole idea that this is some sort of a Brahmin caste studying 
Latin, I think we've blown that out the window,'' Howard said. Mindi 
Goodman, who is the only language teacher at Day Middle School in 
Newton, Mass., recruits students by visiting sixth-grade classes with 
her ``Latin show,'' pitching the benefits of Latin. When she began 
teaching in 1971, Ms. Goodman had 30 Latin students; now she has 160, 
more than a third of the student body. She promises her recruits better 
standardized-test grades and a leg up on English vocabulary. ``She 
came in and sold it to us,'' said Elana Rome, now an eighth grader. 
``It just seemed like so much fun.'' And, it turns out, it is. Students 
like Stephanie Carrera, also an eighth grader, are particularly taken 
with all the new insults they have learned using Latin roots. If they 
want to chide someone for childish, dull stupidity, they need only 
say, ``You are a prime example of puerile hebetudinous desipience.''
