Exxon and Mobil Corporations are in the final stages of talks that 
could result in the world's largest industrial merger. From member 
station WNYC in New York, Lance Lucky reports. As members of oil-producing 
countries meet in Vienna trying to cope with the lowest oil prices 
in 25 years, Exxon and Mobil appear poised to merge, creating an industry 
giant with a combined market capitalization of some $240 billion. 
It would make it the third largest company in the world. It would 
dramatically cap off a trend in the oil industry which has seen the 
takeover of Amoco by British Petroleum, along with numerous joint 
ventures. Exxon Chief Executive Lee Raymond says he's not looking 
to reunite John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken 
up in 1911. He wants to deliver more value to his shareholders. Exxon 
and Mobil could announce their intentions as early as next week. For 
NPR News, I'm Lance Lucky in New York.
