In Boston, I'm Tony Kahn. We'll be back again tomorrow with another 
spin of the world. THE WORLD is a co-production of the BBC World Service, 
Public Radio International, and WGBH Boston, and is made possible 
in part by the PRI program fund, whose contributors include the Ford 
Foundation, the John D. and Katherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and 
the Theresa and H. John Hines III Foundation. PRI, Public Radio International.
