It was a wild one in the Silver Dome in Pontiac, Michigan. That's 
where the Pittsburgh Steelers were taking on the Detroit Lyons in 
a Thanksgiving Day National Football League contest. This game featured 
many controversial calls: passes that were not passes, interceptions 
that were not interceptions, or turned into interceptions when they 
weren't, all kinds of things, including the coin-toss for the overtime 
period. Now Jerome Bettis of the Pittsburgh Steelers says, and he 
would probably swear to this, that he called Tails, just like Bill 
Cower said he should. You can hear it on the audio of the game. He 
calls Tails, but the referee said the call was heads, the Lions won 
the overtime field, overtime coin toss. They got the ball, they went 
down the field, they scored a field goal, they won the game 19-16.
