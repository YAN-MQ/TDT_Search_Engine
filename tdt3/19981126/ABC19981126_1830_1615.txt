Flip Wilson has died. He was beloved by millions of us for being clever, 
clean and funny. Underappreciated was the fact that flip Wilson was 
a television pioneer. Which on many weeks was the number one show 
in America. Bill Cosby, right? Wrong. You're not Bill Cosby. I know 
Bill Cosby when I see him. At the end of the bed, will you please? 
What does it say? yes. Sure enough. Bill Cosby. That's right. Star 
of stage, screen, theater, concerts, records, everything. Yes, stage, 
screen, concerts, everything. yes. You must be here for a swollen 
ego. Flip Wilson died of liver cancer at 64. The best eulogy, surely 
would have come from Reverend leroy.
