Antitrust regulators in Washington and at the European Union in Brussels 
are conducting separate investigations into recent price increases 
announced by the Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, the world's largest 
manufacturers of big commercial airliners. A spokesman for Airbus 
said Thursday that it had been notified of the investigation by the 
Federal Trade Commission in the United States. He denied that the 
two companies had cooperated in setting prices. Sean O'Donnell, a 
spokesman for Boeing in Seattle, declined to comment and referred 
inquiries to the commission. FTC officials were unavailable for comment. 
Karel van Miert, the European competition commissioner, said his office 
had also sent ``a series of questions'' to the companies, Bloomberg 
News reported. ``We have received substantial responses and are now 
evaluating them,'' van Miert said. The FTC investigation, first reported 
Thursday by The Financial Times of London, followed increases in list 
prices by both Airbus and Boeing. Boeing raised prices on its aircraft 
by 5 percent on July 21, its first increase in 23 years. Airbus made 
a 3 percent increase in September. ``There was no collusion whatsoever,'' 
said an Airbus spokesman in Toulouse, France, who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. ``That would be totally illegal.'' Last year, European 
antitrust regulators threatened to block the $14 billion merger of 
Boeing and the McDonnell Douglas Corp. The European Commission let 
the deal go through after Boeing agreed to back away from exclusive 
supplier contracts it had signed with several U.S. airlines. Both 
companies have been struggling for market share. Boeing, the long-standing 
leader, has had about 60 percent and Airbus about 30 percent. Airbus 
recently obtained an order valued at $8.5 billion from British Airways 
PLC, which had been virtually an exclusive customer of Boeing, and 
a $3.5 billion commitment from a group of Latin American airlines. 
Industry officials have said that to obtain such orders, Airbus had 
to reduce prices sharply, possibly to levels below its costs. They 
said plane makers often made deals at discounted prices, expecting 
to recover in lucrative follow-up deliveries of spare parts, services 
and additional orders for planes. Boeing has been under pressure to 
raise prices after a $178 million loss last year, its first in half 
a century. Ronald B. Woodward, president of the commercial aircraft 
division at Boeing, was forced out and company officials suggested 
that their priority would be profitability, even if they lost market 
share to Airbus. The price of commercial jets has dropped 20 percent 
over the last two years, squeezing the profit margins of plane makers. 
Earnings at Airbus fell 61 percent, to $147 million, last year. Noel 
Forgeard, who took over as chief executive of Airbus on April 1, is 
under pressure to improve profits as Airbus changes to a unified corporation. 
It was created as a loose consortium of four companies _ Aerospatiale 
of France, Daimler of Germany, British Aerospace and Construcciones 
Aeronauticas SA of Spain. The revamped Airbus plans eventually to 
sell shares to investors. Industry analysts found little merit in 
accusations of price fixing. ``On the contrary,'' said Daniel Solon, 
an analyst in London with Avmark International, a consulting firm. 
Price increases would be ``a return to sanity by both companies,'' 
he said. He said Forgeard's predecessor at Airbus, Jean Pierson, had 
cut prices in a drive for market share. Boeing tried to match the 
Airbus reductions. ``They are both right in getting less hysterical 
about who has what relative share of the market,'' Solon said. The 
European Commission can impose severe fines on companies that it finds 
have been fixing prices. Last month, the commission fined Asea Brown 
Boveri Ltd., the big Swiss electrical engineering company, $80 million 
on price-fixing charges involving heating pipe, Bloomberg News reported. 
This week, commission inspectors seeking evidence of price fixing 
for plasterboard raided the offices of Lafarge SA and BPB PLC, two 
big building materials companies, Bloomberg said.
