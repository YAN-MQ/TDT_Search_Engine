Youth drug abuse continues to rise in Southeast Asia despite legal 
crackdowns, threatening the ``fabric of society,'' officials at a 
regional anti-drug conference said Thursday. They urged a cooperative 
global effort that would incorporate young people's views and encourage 
alternative healthy activities. ``Undoubtedly, drug abuse is extremely 
dangerous to the survival of a nation, and it may even endanger mankind 
in general,'' said a paper presented by Bersama, an Indonesian umbrella 
group of anti-drug organizations. ``Drug trafficking has such a huge 
criminal network that they have the ability to impose their will on 
society. Drug abuse is not merely a single problem; it is always associated 
with other aspects of life, such as health, security and socio-economy.'' 
Maria-Pia de Palo, program officer for the U.N. Drug Control Program's 
Regional Center for East Asia and the Pacific, said the biggest rise 
has been in synthetic drugs, including amphetamine-type stimulants 
like Ecstasy. ``There are also disturbing indications that young people 
are increasingly being exposed to a popular youth culture and mass 
media messages that are more tolerant toward the use of certain illicit 
drugs,'' she said. De Palo said youths must be involved in seeking 
solutions. ``Young people are usually considered a target population 
and sometimes even a problem instead of a resource in the prevention 
of drug abuse,'' she said. ``It is fundamental that their voices be 
heard in the attempt to raise awareness among their peers, policy 
makers and the public at large.'' In recent years, Vietnam, Indonesia 
and other countries have stiffened their penalties for drug abuse 
and trafficking. In Vietnam, 34 people were sentenced to death for 
drug trafficking in the first eight months of the year. ``The government 
of Vietnam is deeply concerned that drug abuse continues to be more 
and more serious, particularly among young people, which endangers 
... the fabric of society and erodes cultural values and the family,'' 
Le Minh Huong of the Ministry of Public Security said in an opening 
speech. Despite such efforts, drug addiction continues to rise, particularly 
among the young. ``National efforts are important but not enough,'' 
said a paper by the Secretariat of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations. ``There should also be concerted efforts at the regional 
and international levels with a global approach and participation 
of all sectors in the societies.'' Not every country has seen increases. 
Singapore said its number of drug-abuse arrests has declined since 
peaking in 1994 and that youths comprise only 6.8 percent of all drug 
abusers. It credited a number of initiatives, including a high-profile 
campaign introduced in 1995 that is launched each year with a variety 
of concerts featuring popular local and international stars espousing 
anti-drug messages. ``The annual campaign aims to raise the awareness 
of the general public toward the detrimental social and economic effects 
of drug abuse, and to introduce alternative healthy lifestyles to 
our youths,'' a paper from the island nation said.
