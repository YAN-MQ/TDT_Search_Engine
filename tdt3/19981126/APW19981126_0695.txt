Four birdies in the last seven holes Thursday propelled Zimbabwean 
Nick Price toward the top of a leader board dominated by South Africans 
on the first day of the Zimbabwe Open golf championship. Seventh in 
world golf rankings, Price found himself one over par after 10 holes 
but he fought back to return a three under par 69 with birdies at 
the 12th, 13th, 15th and a tap-in at the last. This put him in joint 
fifth place. Price said his weaker performance in the early going 
was partly due to jet lag. ``For me it was a dawn patrol today. My 
driving was indifferent and I paid the price a couple of times,'' 
price said. ``But then I got my tee shots organized, my putting improved 
and overall I was well pleased with the day.'' Price is defending 
his home country's open title and going for a third championship victory 
before his home town fans and on the Royal Harare course he redesigned 
two years ago. He is three shots behind Tjart van der Walt, who was 
second to him last year. Van der Walt, of South Africa, is on six 
under par 66, a shot ahead of compatriot Ryan Dreyer and a further 
shot clear of two other South Africans, Alan McLean and Andre van 
Staden. Price shares fifth place with South African Warren Abery. 
Zimbabwean Mark McNulty had an indifferent day, finishing on two over 
par 74 but Tony Johnstone, also of Zimbabwe, was handily placed on 
level par 72.
