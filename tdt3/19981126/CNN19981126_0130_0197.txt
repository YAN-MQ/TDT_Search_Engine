Traffic jams, long lines and crowded trains are not exactly pleasant 
thanksgiving appetizers. But millions of Americans got a taste of 
travelers' frustration Wednesday as the holiday weekend began in earnest. 
There's some debate on whether the day before Thanksgiving is the 
busiest travel day of the year. But for those in the crush, the superlatives 
probably don't matter. Some Amtrak trains were standing-room-only. 
And some airlines say that nearly all of their planes were in service. 
Aaa says 34 million Americans are on the move this holiday. 28 million 
drive themselves, the others travel by plane, train or bus. For most, 
the destination is familiar. 63% are staying with family and friends.
