A quick review tonight of the way we Americans observed our holiday 
of thanks. Collectively, we ate today 45 million turkeys. Early in 
the day, we stuffed them, later, we stuffed ourselves. Whatever the 
weather, wherever they were, this was a day for Americans to celebrate 
an American tradition. The nation's oldest Thanksgiving parade in 
Philadelphia. A relative newcomer in Houston. In New York, even a 
torrential downpour couldn't keep 2 million people off the sidewalks. 
Last year, several paradegoers were injured when balloons broke their 
tethers. This year, spiderman and three other balloons were grounded 
the winds got too high. For the record this was the 377th Thanksgiving. 
And Americans around the world paused to give thanks. In some cases 
thankful that things are not worse. Many who were in the position 
to give, did. Their time, their turkeys. More than 10,000 ate at Atlanta's 
Turner field. Josea Williams annual feeding. 25,000 more in San Antonio 
where Raul jiminez has been feeding the hungry for 19 years. And there 
was anger where this holiday began so long ago, where the pilgrims 
came ashore in Plymouth, Massachusetts. We will not celebrate a day 
that glorifies the European invasion of our lands, the theft of our 
lands. 1500 American Indians want the rest of the country to know 
this is their national day of mourning. Their troubles began, they 
say, when they were nice to the pilgrims 377 years ago.
