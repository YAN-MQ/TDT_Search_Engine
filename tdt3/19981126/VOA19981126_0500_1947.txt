Chinese President Jiang Zemin has been officially welcomed to Japan 
by Japanese Emperor Akihito. Mr. Jiang is the first Chinese Head of 
State to visit the island country. But, Japan's unwillingness to issue 
a forthright apology in written form for its wartime crimes discussed 
appalled over the visit. As we hear from VOA's Roger Wilkinson. Mr. 
Jiang was more somber than he usually is at ceremonial occasions as 
he reviewed a Japanese honor guard Thursday. The Chinese President 
has long-stated his desire for a clear-cut apology by Japan for it's 
invasion and occupation of China during the 1930's and 1940's. That, 
he said, is the only way ties between the two East Asian giants can 
move forward. Japan, however, is only willing to give China a verbal 
apology, although they are prepared to include an expression of deep 
remorse over Chinese aggression in a joint statement to be issued 
later Thursday after Mr. Jung's summit with Japanese Prime Minister, 
Keizo Obuchi. That was the deal worked out between the Japanese and 
Chinese Foreign Ministers on Tuesday, but Japanese news media reports 
Mr. Jung is not satisfied with the arrangement. He wants an apology 
to China along the lines of what Japan gave South Korea earlier this 
month when President Kim Don Jung visited Tokyo. Now a Japanese Foreign 
Official says the two sides will issue a joint statement but will 
not sign it. The official says no such signing ceremony was scheduled 
anyway and he denies that the decision not to sign the document has 
anything to do with the contents of the statement. Japan says that 
they expressed remorse for it's past transgressions when it normalized 
relations with China in 1972. But Chinese Officials insist Japan unlike 
Germany, have never formally apologized for its atrocities during 
World War II. China says at least 20 million Chinese were killed by 
Japanese troops during the war. A western diplomat says the Obuchi 
government is too politically weak to feel comfortable issuing a forth-wide 
apology which would be opposed by powerful conservative politicians. 
Rightwing groups that oppose any expression of atonement for Japan's 
wartime row, are even protesting the hedge apology Mr. Obuchi is offering 
the Chinese. Roger Wilkinson, VOA News, Tokyo.
