The start of the Christmas season in the town where Jesus was born 
marks a mad rush to complete a total makeover of Manger Square in 
time for the holidays and for millennium celebrations next year. Manger 
Square, in front of the 4th century church built over the traditional 
birthplace of Jesus, is one big construction site. Two yellow tractors 
clear away rubble as workmen lay large, square stone tiles that are 
to cover the football-field-sized square. They're about one-quarter 
done. The rest of the square is dust, dirt, open trenches and piles 
of gravel, sand and bags of cement. City officials claim the dlrs 
12 million project will be nearly completed by Christmas Eve. Palestinian 
merchants, watching the proceedings from their empty stores around 
the square, say that would be a miracle. Even according to the most 
optimistic schedule, the square will not be ready for visitors in 
the middle of December, least of all President Bill Clinton. City 
officials expect Clinton to stop by and light the Christmas tree during 
a visit to the Palestinian areas and Israel. A chain-link fence stands 
between Angela Giacaman's large gift shop and the ruins of Manger 
Square. The store is at the end of a row of shops along one side of 
the square, near the church. Before construction, three steps along 
the length of the row of shops connected them with the square. Now 
there is a three-foot dropoff. A rickety wooden plank crosses it at 
one end. Work started in August. ``They destroyed our summer season, 
and now they are destroying our winter season,'' said Giacaman, who 
has run her souvenir store for 20 years. Disgusted, she pointed to 
a few tourists raising a cloud of dust on the other side of the square. 
``They have to climb over rubble to get to the church,'' she complained. 
Bethlehem Mayor Hanna J. Nasser presides over the project from his 
wood-panelled office on the second floor of city hall, facing the 
Church of the Nativity at the other end of Manger Square. He promises 
that the square will be ready for Christmas and reminds the disgruntled 
merchants: ``You cannot construct things if you do not destroy things,'' 
he said. Nasser said this reconstruction project has been his dream 
for 25 years, but there was never enough money. Then along comes the 
millennium, a one-time chance to remake Bethlehem for the celebrations 
of the year 2000. Large donations came from Europe, Japan and the 
United States. ``This occasion is a very important and unique vehicle 
for us to use for developing the city,'' Nasser observed with a sly 
smile. Khader Ali, 50, sat dejectedly on a stool at the end of Milk 
Grotto Street overlooking Manger Square. He owns a small restaurant, 
appropriately named ``Ruins'' at the other end of the street. The 
end next to the church, where Ali sat, was blocked off by a large 
cement sewer pipe fixture at the edge of Manger Square. Ali didn't 
bother opening his restaurant. It stands forlornly shuttered amid 
a row of shops in the shadow of a huge, square church bell tower. 
Shrugging a shoulder toward the rubble, he complained, ``Because of 
this, they destroyed the business, especially for me inside.'' Ali 
admitted that in the long run, he will benefit from this. ``When it 
is finished,'' he said. ``It will be 100 times better than before.'' 
City engineer Judeh Morkos underlines that. Standing on a City Hall 
balcony surveying the work in progress, he pointed out the renovation 
project includes reworking Bethlehem's ancient and crumbling infrastructure 
_ water, sewage, electricity and phones, to benefit the city's 24,000 
residents. A sign on one corner of the church states the projected 
completion date is Jan. 3, 10 days after Christmas. Morkos said he 
is pressing the contractor to finish by Dec. 23. Standing in shirtsleeves 
under a bright sun, Morkos admitted the weather has been in his favor. 
The rainy season is a month late. ``Maybe this is a gift from God 
to us,'' said Morkos.
