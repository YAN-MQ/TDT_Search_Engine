We gladly listen to Boris Maksimov regularly on THE WORLD. Coming 
up, we listen to the blues on PRI. I'm Brian Lehrer. There's much 
ado about the media these days from the quality of the news you get 
to the ways the Internet or TV shows like "Dawson's Creek" or "Jerry 
Springer" influence the way we live our lives. So for a lively look 
at these issues and more, join me every week for NPR's "On the Media." 
That's Friday night at on 91 FM, WHYY. Holiday shopping is upon us, 
but don't let it stress you.. I'm Ellen Kushner. On this week's "Sound 
and Spirit," we'll be hearing a host of new CD releases, seeking out 
the sound that perfectly fits the spirit of everyone on your list. 
We'll also hear letters about past programs and take a look forward 
into the new year. It's "Sound and Spirits" gift-giving edition from 
PRI, Public Radio International. Saturday night at on 91 FM, WHYY. 
This is THE WORLD. I'm Tony Kahn.
