Calling Boris Yeltsin's government ``squishy as cabbage,'' the speaker 
of Russia's upper house of parliament abandoned his support for the 
president Thursday and called for a transfer of some powers to parliament. 
The statement was remarkable coming from Yegor Stroyev _ a moderate 
who until now had firmly refused to take sides against Yeltsin _ and 
another sign that the ailing president is losing even his most loyal 
supporters. ``The government is as squishy as cabbage in the fall,'' 
Stroyev, the speaker of the Federation Council, said in an interview 
published in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. He joined a growing number 
of former presidential supporters who have distanced themselves from 
Yeltsin in recent days, while the president remains hospitalized with 
pneumonia. Stroyev said that a weakened president was unable to use 
the extensive powers granted him under the Russian constitution. ``There 
is a flow of accusations against the president for having sweeping 
powers unrivaled by any other president, but these powers end at the 
Kremlin walls,'' Stroyev said. The Kremlin released no new details 
Thursday on the president's condition. Still, a series of illnesses 
has turned Yeltsin into a part-time president and fueled strong doubts 
about his ability to serve out the remainder of a term that runs until 
mid-2000. Valentin Pokrovsky, a doctor and the president of the Russian 
Academy of Medical Sciences, who has examined Yeltsin in the past, 
said Thursday that the president seems ``rather tired and not quite 
healthy.'' The Communist-led opposition in parliament's lower house 
has pushed for a bill that would require a medical checkup for the 
president, with the results made public. So far, the move has failed. 
While parliament's lower house has long been opposition-dominated, 
Stroyev's upper house, made up of regional governors, has been generally 
pro-Yeltsin _ until recently. Stroyev didn't touch upon Yeltsin's 
health in his interview, but spoke for a check on presidential powers 
and a corresponding increase of parliamentary authority. ``No reasonable 
man doubts that the constitution needs revision,'' Stroyev said. ``The 
parliament's functions have been unreasonably reduced.'' In another 
blow to Yeltsin, his former chief bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov on 
Thursday reiterated allegations that the president and his family 
are manipulated by controversial business mogul Boris Berezovsky. 
Korzhakov called a news conference to claim that Berezovsky was blackmailing 
the president's family, threatening to release compromising materials. 
He did not elaborate. Berezovsky, who has gained a reputation as an 
influential background player in Russian politics, serves as the executive 
secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of 
ex-Soviet republics. Many in Russia believe that Berezovsky is a strong 
influence on Yeltsin _ as Korzhakov had been before he was dismissed 
in a Kremlin power struggle in 1996. Berezovsky dismissed Korzhakov's 
allegations Thursday, and the Kremlin refused to comment, the Interfax 
news agency said.
