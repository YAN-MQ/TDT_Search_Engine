Happy Thanksgiving. This is "CNN Headline News." I'm holly Firfer 
in for Catherine Callaway. Financial markets, government offices and 
banks are closed for the thanksgiving holiday. Many Americans are 
spending the day preparing a holiday feast for family and friends. 
Others braved the rainy New York streets for the Macy's Thanksgiving 
day parade. The raincoats were on, the umbrellas opened and the floats 
were afloat today as the parade got under way. This year, the massive 
balloons are on a tight reign to prevent any mishaps like the one 
that injured a spectator last year. Each balloon has 60 handlers, 
up from last queer. Some are anchors by utility vehicles. This is 
the 72nd year of the famous parade.
