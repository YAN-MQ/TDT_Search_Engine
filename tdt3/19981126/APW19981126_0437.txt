Dutch banking and insurance combine ING Group NV said Thursday its 
nine-month net profit rose 42 percent, but its banking results were 
slashed by global financial woes. Net profit for the nine months ending 
Sept. 30 came to 4.86 billion guilders (dlrs 2.56 billion), up from 
3.43 billion guilders (dlrs 1.8 billion) in the same period a year 
ago. But non-recurring items contributed 1.34 billion guilders (dlrs 
705 million) to ING's total profit increase. Excluding these items, 
net profit rose only by 2.9 percent to 3.53 billion guilders (dlrs 
1.85 billion). The company reiterated its full-year expectation, saying 
that 1998 earnings per share will be 15 percent higher from last year's 
figure. Pretax profit from its banking operations dropped 9.6 percent 
to 2.10 billion guilders (dlrs 1.1 billion), from 2.32 billion guilders 
(dlrs 1.22 billion). ING said if non-recurring sales results were 
excluded, profit would have decreased by 35 percent. The sharp drop 
was caused entirely by losses in the third quarter due to the worldwide 
financial crisis, said the company in a statement. ING's insurance 
arm fared better. Pretax profit rose 70.3 percent to 4.24 billion 
guilders (dlrs 2.23 billion), up from 2.49 billion guilders (dlrs 
1.31 billion). But excluding non-recurring items, such as one-off 
sales profits, the operational result rose by 31.8 percent.
