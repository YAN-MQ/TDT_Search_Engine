Nicholas Garrigan, the willfully oblivious hero of Giles Foden's first 
novel, is a nightmare version of Forrest Gump transplanted to Uganda: 
he is a witness to many of the bloody atrocities committed during 
the 1970s rule of Ugandan President Idi Amin, the confidant of both 
Amin and the British consul, a witness to the Entebbe hijacking and 
hostage rescue and an unwitting accomplice in the bombing of a plane. 
``The Last King of Scotland'' (which was published to considerable 
acclaim in Britain earlier this year) is an uncomfortable amalgam 
of black comedy and historical tragedy _ the sort of thing you'd get 
if you took Evelyn Waugh's ``Black Mischief'' and William Boyd's ``Good 
Man in Africa'' and set them against the backdrop of a real-life mass 
killing. The result is a highly readable but troubling novel that 
inadvertently trivializes the plight of the estimated 500,000 people 
who died in Uganda during Amin's eight-year reign of terror. The fictional 
Garrigan, we learn, is a Scottish physician, posted by the British 
Ministry of Health in a remote Ugandan village to work in a clinic. 
Through a chance encounter, he becomes Amin's personal physician, 
a job that will make him privy to many of the heinous acts committed 
during the dictator's reign. As the novel's narrator, Garrigan initially 
comes across as a bumbling but likable twit: a self-absorbed fellow 
looking for women and a good time. Still, Garrigan readily admits 
that he has a ``closed-in, oblivious temperament,'' and he soon falls 
under the spell of Idi Amin, whom he likens to ``a being out of Greek 
myth.'' The real-life Amin has been described by journalists as a 
larger-than-life figure, capable of exuding childlike geniality one 
minute, irrational rage the next, and the portrait of the ruler that 
Foden, a staff writer for The Guardian, draws in this novel clearly 
owes a debt to such descriptions. Foden's Amin is a monster of egotism, 
declaring himself ``the savior of Africa'' and the ``most powerful 
figure in the world.'' He boasts of cannibalism. He absurdly maintains, 
``Anything that is done in my name, it is the right thing. Any bad 
thing done, it is by those who are disobeying me.'' And when asked 
about atrocities committed by his soldiers, he replies, ``There have 
been a few mistakes.'' Because we see Amin in this novel through the 
star-struck eyes of Nick Garrigan, however, the comic, rather than 
monstrous, aspects of his personality tend to be italicized. This 
Amin drives a red Maserati and swans about Uganda, dressed in ridiculous 
costumes: full Highland dress, complete with kilt, spats and brogans; 
or an electric-blue safari suit with a matching sombrero. He even 
rigs up an elaborate machine that allows him to make a grand entrance 
by rising from the midst of a swimming pool. Foden's Amin captivates 
Garrigan, who soon admits to feeling ``a sneaking sense of affection 
towards him.'' Garrigan accepts a used van from his new boss, using 
it to drive around Kampala to visit bars and clubs. And when his affair 
with the British ambassador's wife fails to ignite, he finds comfort 
in Amin's philosophical words about romance. Despite knowing that 
the dictator thinks ``Hitler was right about the Jews,'' despite seeing 
the hacked-up body of Amin's unfaithful wife, Garrigan persists in 
being his friend. There was, he concedes to himself, ``something in 
me that actually liked the man, monster though he was.'' Garrigan 
decides to leave Uganda only after Amin turns on him and has his British 
passport revoked. He realizes that he has been corrupted by Amin, 
that he has, in a sense, become Amin, ``a suppurating beast, someone 
with a smell of evil about his person.'' Garrigan's story is presumably 
meant to make the point that one cannot be an innocent bystander when 
appalling crimes are being committed, that bystanders who ratify such 
acts by refusing to dissent are morally contaminated themselves. By 
the end of the book, Garrigan is saying ``I merely did my job,'' echoing 
those Germans who aided Hitler by shutting their eyes to his crimes. 
His private feelings of guilt have also given way to the conviction 
that he has put Amin's world ``with all its blood and crazed illusions'' 
behind him. In the end, the reader remains mystified by Garrigan's 
bizarre affection for Amin in the face of so many horrors: his suggestion 
that his own Scottish heritage made him susceptible to Amin's claims 
to be the ``last King of the Scots'' remains absurd, as is his suggestion 
that Amin's charisma is nearly impossible to resist. Worse, the comic 
tone of much of this novel overshadows the reality of the horrors 
actually committed in the Uganda of Idi Amin. Although Foden does 
a vivid job of describing the decapitated bodies, the mutilated corpses, 
the unspeakable crimes committed by Amin's henchmen, such scenes essentially 
become a suspenseful backdrop for Garrigan's bumbling adventures. 
Midway through ``The Last King of Scotland,'' one of Foden's characters 
says of Idi Amin's antics: ``It would be quite funny if it weren't 
for the thousands of people who are dying. All these silly larks of 
his, it's like pornography. If you laugh at it, you're stepping over 
the corpses.'' The same might well be said of this clever, fluently 
written _ but ultimately perverse _ novel. PUBLICATION NOTES: THE 
LAST KING OF SCOTLAND By Giles Foden 335 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.
