This is THE WORLD, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It's Thursday, November 26th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, 
the case of the extradition of former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, 
enters its final phase. It's now all up to the British. They have 
to take account of both the legal process, the strength of the case 
against the individual, in this case Pinochet, and the political situation 
elsewhere. Also, THE WORLD's Boris Maksimov gives thanks for the mysteries 
of Thanksgiving. And Bob Brozman gives thanks for the blues. If I 
didn't have music as an outlet, I would clearly be in the nut house. 
First, this news. From National Public Radio News in Washington, I'm 
Corey Flintoff.
