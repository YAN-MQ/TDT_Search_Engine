I'm John Bruschard, VOA News. Former First Chilean Dictator, Augusto 
Pinochet remains under police Guard at a private London clinic, a 
day after Britain's House of Lords ruled he is not immune from extradition 
to Spain. Correspondent Laurie Castman reports from London. The final 
decision on Spain's extradition request is up to Britain's home secretary, 
the country's Justice Minister. Conservative politicians are calling 
on him to release Mr. Pinochet on humanitarian grounds. Human rights' 
activists and Chilean exiles are urging the British Minister to take 
action on Spain's request, and send Mr. Pinochet to Madrid to face 
charges of human rights abuses during his 17 year Chilean rule. Home 
Secretary Jack Straw was due to make that decision by next Wednesday. 
But he has asked the British Courts for another week to mull over 
the legal and political implications of the issue. Chile's foreign 
minister is expected in London shortly, to formerly present his government's 
position that Mr. Pinochet be allowed to go home. Laurie Castman, 
VOA NEWS, London.
