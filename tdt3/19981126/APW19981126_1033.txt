After winning in the United States, Canada, Germany and France, Russian 
figure skaters led all four events in Moscow on Thursday, the first 
day of the Cup of Russia. The Cup is the fifth event in the International 
Skating Union's Grand Prix, which features Olympic-eligible skaters 
and is being held in Moscow for the first time. In Skate America and 
Skate Canada, the Russians had four victories in eight events. They 
doubled that in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and added two more at the 
Lalique trophy competition in France. Back on their home turf, the 
Russians again are favorites. In the first day of competition, Russians 
captured all three top positions in the women's short program. Irina 
Slutskaya, 19, the 1995 world junior champion and second to Michelle 
Kwan in the 1998 World Championship, committed the same mistake as 
at Skate Canada, when she two-footed a jump landing. In Moscow on 
Thursday she came in second to Yelena Sokolova. Sokolova, 18, finished 
second at Skate America and is one of a half-dozen Russian skaters 
who could fight for spots for the Russian team. Julia Soldatova was 
in third. Russian World ice dance champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg 
Ovsiannikov are leading in the ice dances after the compulsory dance, 
the Ravensburg Waltz. They made their season debut two weeks ago to 
win the Nations Cup in Gelsenkirchen. Russians captured the men's 
event Thursday as well, with Alexei Urmanov of Russia, the 1994 Olympic 
champion, leading in the short program with the highest marks of the 
day. Yevgeny Plushenko was second and Alexander Abt third. Abt had 
a more difficult routine than Urmanov but missed a triple axel-triple 
loop slightly. In the pairs short program, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton 
Sikharulidze of Russia were first, followed by Dorota Zagorska and 
Mariuzh Sludek of Poland. Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman of the United 
States held third. Original dance with the free program will be held 
on Friday. Winners receive dlrs 30,000. Skaters can accumulate points 
from two of the meets to qualify for the series final in St. Petersburg, 
Russia, in March. The next event is NHK Trophy in Sapporo, Japan, 
in December.
