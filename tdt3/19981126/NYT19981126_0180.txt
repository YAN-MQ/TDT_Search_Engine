OPEC ministers, deeply divided over the best strategy for propping 
up sagging crude oil prices, took no action Thursday on making further 
production cuts. Rilwanu Lukman, secretary general of the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which was meeting in Vienna, said 
the organization already had an agreement in place from June for restraining 
production and that any further agreement would be decided at a meeting 
in March. Oil markets showed only a modest reaction, since it was 
widely expected that OPEC would merely continue with the current production 
cuts, which are scheduled to run out in June. In London, Brent crude 
oil for January delivery ended the day up 6 cents, at $10.96 a barrel, 
after a slight decline earlier. Oil markets in New York were closed 
for Thanksgiving. ``This was about the minimum that was expected,'' 
said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, 
a group in New York that does research for the oil industry. ``If 
they really stick to their quotas it might at least put a floor on 
oil prices.'' The price of crude oil has fallen by about 40 percent 
since the beginning of the year because demand has declined and inventories 
have grown as a result of the economic downturn in Asia and the warm 
autumn in the United States. Earlier this year, OPEC agreed to cut 
production by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily 
supply of 74 million barrels. Leading the cuts were Saudi Arabia and 
Venezuela, OPEC's largest producers, and Mexico, which is not an OPEC 
member but is also a big oil producer. There was dissension among 
the members, with some ministers, including Youcef Yousfi of Algeria, 
advocating deeper cuts. ``I would prefer to have seen further output 
cuts now,'' Yousfi told Bloomberg News after the meeting in Vienna. 
Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar-Zanganeh, argued that Saudi Arabia 
should make further cuts in its production. Saudi Arabia had replaced 
most of the oil production lost when Iraq's exports were cut off after 
its defeat in the Persian Gulf War in 1991. But the Saudis said OPEC 
should enforce its existing cutbacks. This has been a point of contention, 
because some members have failed to make all the cuts they pledged. 
``Unless they do something in March, prices will stay very low through 
1999,'' Lichtblau said. ``It's good for the consumer. You will have 
the lowest gasoline and heating oil prices since 1986.'' Lower prices, 
however, have hit the oil industry hard, with some major oil companies 
making further reductions in already lean work forces and trimming 
exploration budgets.
