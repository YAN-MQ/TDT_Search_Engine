Volunteers around the country are helping those less fortunate celebrate 
thanksgiving. Brian Cabell joins us live from Turner field in Atlanta 
where thousands of people are expected to attend the feed the hungry 
feast. Brian? Hi, holly. This probably is the largest Thanksgiving 
feast in the entire United States. For 30 years now they've been putting 
this on, started out with about 100 people. Now, they will have as 
many as 30,000. We've had entertainment throughout the morning. You're 
looking at volunteers from all over the Atlanta area. The folks who 
are eating, the hungry, the homeless, the downtrodden, well, they're 
over here enjoying a good meal. Right here, we have one of the servers. 
This is my nephew and niece. What brings you out here? I come out 
here every year. Basically, to be able to give back to the public. 
And, you know, to give back to people, the less fortunate and everything. 
So we try to come out here, and basically, get them involved at all 
times. Thank you very much. Thank you. Once again, we're expecting 
up to 30,000 people for about the next six hours or so. This was started 
an irration by hosea Williams. It has grown ever since. They have 
corporate support, individual support, literally hundreds upon hundreds 
of people come out here to help out. Again, the folks who are eating 
are those who are on the streets who are just having a hard time. 
We seem to have some technical difficulties. We apologize for that. 
We'll see if we can get Brian back later.
