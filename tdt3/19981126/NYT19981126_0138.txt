A lawyer for two Kentucky high school seniors who said they were denied 
admission to the National Honor Society because they became pregnant 
has asked a federal judge to force the society to admit the two students 
while they wait for their case to go to trial. ``It won't do them 
much good if they get admitted after they graduate from high school 
in May,'' said Sara Mandelbaum, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties 
Union's Women's Rights Project, which represents the students, Somer 
Chipman, 17, and Chasity Glass, 18, of Grant County High School in 
Williamstown, Ky. ``It's not just the prestige of being in the honor 
society,'' Ms. Mandelbaum said, ``but being able to participate in 
its day-to-day activities, which include meetings, service projects, 
fund-raising and eligibility for National Honor Society scholarships.'' 
But a lawyer for the Grant County School District, Suzanne Cassidy, 
countered: ``Participation in the National Honor Society is a privilege. 
It is not a right.'' Ms. Cassidy also represents the superintendent 
of schools and the five-member faculty committee that selected the 
society members last spring. Judge William Bertelsman of U.S. District 
Court in Covington, Ky., said he would rule by Jan. 1 on the request 
for a temporary injunction forcing the society to admit the students, 
pending a trial. The selection committee for the honor society, Ms. 
Cassidy said, usually evaluates candidates on the basis of scholarship, 
leadership, service and character. In selecting members, local chapters 
generally follow guidelines for the National Honor Society, which 
has more than 15,000 members in high schools throughout the United 
States. Local chapters may also set their own standards. In her interviews 
with school officials, Ms. Cassidy said, she found ``no evidence that 
sex discrimination, parental-status discrimination or any other illegal 
discrimination played a part in the decision by the faculty selection 
committee.'' Speaking after the hearing on Tuesday, Ms. Mandelbaum 
said: ``The issue here is that a school cannot use pregnancy as a 
basis for excluding a student from any educational activity. What 
the school did in this case was to punish students for engaging in 
premarital sex, but all they did was look to see who got pregnant, 
and that rule affects only female students.'' At the end of their 
junior year, Ms. Chipman's grade-point average was 3.9 on a scale 
of 4.0, and Ms. Glass' was 3.7. They were never officially told why, 
out of 33 students with the required academic record, they were the 
only ones to have been denied entry to the National Honor Society. 
When they asked for an explanation, they were told that they had not 
met the criteria. Ms. Glass is single, and she and her daughter, Shelby, 
who is 19 months old, live with her parents. Ms. Chipman's daughter, 
Cheyenne, was born in June, and Ms. Chipman and the baby's father, 
Shawn Hurston, were married in August.
