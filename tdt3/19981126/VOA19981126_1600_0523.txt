Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in London Thursday, 
for consultations about the fragile Middle East Peace Process. Laurie 
Cassman in London reports, Britain renews its commitment to the peace 
process. Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook says his government 
will offer another $150 million of aid to Palestinians and the UN 
agency working with them in order to help push the peace process forward. 
It is very important that we demonstrate to the people who live in 
the back streets of Gaza, on the villages of the West Bank, that they 
have a stake in peace. He announced the gesture after talks with Israeli 
Prime Minister Netanyahu. For his part Mr. Netanyahu says, he is confident 
he can deliver a lasting peace. The one and only way to achieve a 
solution is through negotiation. But the Israeli leader warns that 
negotiations for a final peace settlement will suffer if the Palestinians 
go ahead with their promise to unilaterally declare statehood next 
May. Palestinian leaders, frustrated by the slow progress of the peace 
process have been lobbying European allies for support of their position. 
When asked by reporters about the violence in Israel's self-styled 
security zone inside southern Lebanon, Mr. Netanyahu said a review 
of the situation is underway. But he said Israel would not withdraw 
its soldiers until there are guarantees that residents of Northern 
Israel would be protected from Guerrilla attacks across the border.
