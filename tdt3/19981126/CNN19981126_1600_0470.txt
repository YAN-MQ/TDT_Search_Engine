I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"CNN Headline News" forecast. The rain and snow push offshore in the 
northeast and begin to diminish over thanksgiving evening in the northwest. 
By Friday, however, rain and snow return to the northwest as a trough 
pushes into the pacific northwest region. Otherwise, beautiful weather 
across the rest of the nation, perhaps some clouds from the Great 
Lakes into the desert southwest along a dry frontal system. High temperatures 
on Friday in the 30s in New England and the northern rockies. And 
in the south, quite warm, '70s and even a few '80s. Your extended 
forecast for Saturday showing rain and snow in the western third of 
the country, windy over the upper plains. And we're going to see a 
warm-up throughout the nation. Sunday, rain and snow continue in the 
northwest. Showers from the four corners region into Missouri. Showers 
also over the Great Lakes. On Monday, snow in the Great Lakes turning 
into scattered showers as you push to the south. Rain and snow continuing 
in the northwest with mild temperatures prevailing. And remember, 
you can get your four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities at
