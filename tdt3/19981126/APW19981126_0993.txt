French rail service slowed to crawl Thursday night as train workers 
began their second national strike in a week. The French national 
train company, the SNCF, said service across the country would be 
seriously disrupted at least until Saturday morning. About one in 
three trains were expected to run Thursday night and Friday, the SNCF 
said. Only Eurostar trains to London, Thalys trains to Brussels and 
the fast train to Switzerland were expected to run normally Friday.
