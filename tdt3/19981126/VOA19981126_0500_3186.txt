Mergers have dominated economic news this week with a rash of new 
announcements on Monday. But, the latest since it's only on a talking 
stage at this point would be a whopper. The largest U.S. oil company, 
Exxon, is negotiating to buy Mobile Oil, the nations second largest 
for what analysts say would be for at least 61 billion dollars. However, 
the merger could draw close scrutiny from federal regulators since 
it would reconstitute much of John D. Rockerfeller's standard oil 
monopoly that was broken into 34 companies by anti-trust action in 
1911. That's business, I'm Les Carpenter.
