Three former college basketball players are going to jail for their 
participation in a point-shaving scandal at Northwestern University 
four years ago. Kenneth Dionlee and Duey Williams have received thirty 
day sentences after telling federal authorities they tried to fix 
games during the 1994-95 season. Former Notre Dame athlete, Kevin 
Pendagrass, will serve two months for helping to organize the scheme. 
The conspiracy was designed to ensure the success of bets that were 
placed against Northwestern to cover points spreads in three separate 
games. The scandal is the second college basketball point-shaving 
scheme to come to light in the past year. Two former players of Arizona 
State recently pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit sports bribery 
during the 1993-94 season.
