Netscape communications is losing its independence in the buyout by 
America online and sun Microsystems. Some employees have mixed feelings 
about that. Casey wian reports. Netscape employees are still pondering 
the implications of the company's $4.2 billion deal to be acquired 
by America online. Company officials issued a gag order, banning employees 
from speaking with the media. Those few willing to talk are optimistic. 
It's okay with me. Like, it doesn't affect me personally. We know 
what we're doing here, so it's fine. Many of Netscape's 2,600 workers 
will profit handsomely from the recent rise in the company's stock. 
Even management's refusal to discuss the possibility of layoffs doesn't 
worry this employee, who joined Netscape just a month ago. This industry 
is rich with opportunity. And the combining of AOL ing and Netscape 
and the alliance with sun only generates far more opportunity. I'm 
not worried in the slightest. But for some longtime Netscape employees, 
the proposed merger is the corporate equivalent of throwing in the 
towel in the company's long-running battle with Microsoft. Off camera, 
they expressed disappointment that Netscape will no longer be independent. 
They also worry that America online's more traditional corporate culture 
will clash with freewheeling Netscape, where employees dress down 
and bring their pets to work. But most realize that for Netscape to 
survive, it needs help -- in this case, AOL and its Internet muscle. 
They are partnering with a company that has soundly beaten Microsoft 
in an area that Microsoft has very aggressively wanted to enter. So, 
I think, if anything, if they can shore up that opportunity and make 
aOL's opportunity even better and more competitive to Microsoft, I 
think netscape will deem themselves successful. Many employees who 
joined Netscape around the time it started in 1994 will soon be able 
to exercise lucrative stock options. Some are planning to take that 
money and leave to seek other opportunities in Silicon Valley. Casey 
wian, "CNN Financial News," mountain view, California.
