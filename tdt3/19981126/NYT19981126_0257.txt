A surgeon who was on his way to visit a patient was repeatedly stabbed 
in an elevator of a Brooklyn hospital Thursday during an apparent 
robbery attempt, the police said. Dr. Magdy Bouraee, 48, was in stable 
condition Thursday night with wounds to his neck, face and arm at 
Lutheran Medical Center, where the attack occurred and where he has 
worked for nearly 20 years, said Myles Davis, a senior vice president 
at the hospital. The wounds were not life-threatening, and Davis said 
that the prognosis for Bouraee, who underwent surgery, was ``excellent.'' 
Davis said Bouraee withdrew cash from an automated teller machine 
in the hospital's lobby around 3:15 p.m. and then walked 25 feet to 
the elevator and got in with another man. Between the lobby and the 
fourth floor, where Bouraee was going to check on one of his patients, 
the man grabbed him from behind in a choke hold and stabbed him four 
times, in the neck, near the right eye, in a forearm and a hand, Davis 
said. When the elevator stopped on the fourth floor, the attacker 
fled, leaving the doctor slumped in the car, Davis said. A large folding 
knife was found in the car, he said. It was not known whether any 
money was taken, Davis said, but police said robbery appeared to be 
the motive for the attack. Police said they had no suspects. Davis 
declined to say whether a video camera was in the elevator, but he 
said the hospital was secure. He said that in his nearly 20 years 
at the hospital, he had never heard of any attacks there. Bouraee, 
who attended medical school in Cairo, lives in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 
with his wife and three children. He was not scheduled to work Thursday, 
but hospital officials said doctors often visited their patients on 
days off. A neighbor of Bouraee, Chris Reinke, described him as equally 
devoted to his family and his profession.
