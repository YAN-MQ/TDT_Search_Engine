Thanksgiving is the heaviest holiday travel period and one of the 
busiest retail shopping times. But what happens when you combine travel 
and shopping? Stephanie Oswald explains, in this edition of "working 
ahead." It may be the most unusual place in the world to shop. Bought 
these Ray-bans. The unclaimed baggage center in scottsboro, Alabama, 
sells -- you guessed it -- items found in lost airline luggage. We 
stock over a million items every year in our facilities. The department 
of transportation says only 2% of luggage mishandled by airlines is 
lost or unclaimed. The majority of bags, 98%, are reunited with owners 
within five days. Once an airline pays out a lost bag claim, usually 
within 100 days of the loss, it's theirs to sell. And it will likely 
end up at this store. Cameras and bicycles, and you name it. I can't 
believe all this stuff gets lost on airplanes. The draw for the 500,000 
shoppers a year -- bargains. We price things at 50% to 80% off of 
retail. Beautiful Cartier watch, it's appraised at $23,000, so it'd 
be $11,500. Appraisers authenticate an item's worth, and there's a 
two-week return policy. But seasoned shoppers say, go prepared. Research 
what you're looking for before you come. If you can't make the trip 
to Alabama, you can shop the store online. Stephanie Oswald, CNN, 
scottsboro, Alabama.
