Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair says his nation and Ireland must 
not become prisoners of history by letting the chance for lasting 
peace slip away. Mr. Blair told Irish lawmakers he is optimistic peace 
will prevail despite the current deadlock over paramilitary disarmament 
in Northern Ireland. It was the first address to the Irish Parliament 
by a British leader since Ireland won independence from Great Britain 
76 years ago. I'm John Bruschard VOA News.
