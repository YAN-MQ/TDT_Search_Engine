What Jeffrey Forster considers art looks to most people like a stack 
of old mail. But in the rarefied world of philately, his collection 
of 1869 stamps _ most still affixed to their original envelopes _ 
are masterpieces worth an estimated $1 million. Last weekend, Forster's 
precious collection was stolen outside the Jacob K. Javits Convention 
Center, where it had been one of several collections on display at 
the Postage Stamp Mega Event. Forster, 53, a lawyer from San Jose, 
Calif., said the theft occurred on Sunday afternoon as he left the 
exhibition hall with a locked briefcase holding his stamp collection 
and two other pieces of luggage. Forster said he set his bags near 
the curb and turned his back for a few seconds to hail a cab. When 
he turned back around, the briefcase was gone. The police said they 
had no leads in the case, but Forster said he remained hopeful the 
stamps, which are fully insured, would be found. In a telephone interview 
Thursday, he said he was offering a $25,000 reward for the return 
of his collection. The theft, believed to be the largest ever of rare 
stamps, brought a sad end to one of the most prestigious stamp exhibitions 
of the year and has ignited panic among stamp collectors across the 
United States. ``It sends a shiver through the hobby,'' said Bill 
Welch, editor of the American Philatelist, the journal of the 56,000-member 
American Philatelic Society. ``It simply underscores the point that 
when you're traveling with your stamps, you can't let them out of 
your grip for one second.'' Linn's Stamp News, a weekly publication 
based in Sidney, Ohio, that is sent to some 70,000 subscribers, reported 
the theft on its front page under the headline ``Million-Dollar Collection 
Swiped from a New York Sidewalk.'' Its publisher and editor, Michael 
Laurence, said collectors who heard the news have discussed plans 
to increase the insurance on their stamps and ways to make stamp exhibitions 
safer. ``These are like rare works of art,'' Laurence said. The theft 
was most distressing, of course, to Forster, a business lawyer who 
spent 25 years acquiring his collection and exhibited it at stamp 
shows around the world. ``Collectors of stamps, just like art collectors 
or collectors of rare books, are caretakers of history,'' he said. 
``We are simply preserving these things for the next generation of 
collectors.'' The stamps in Forster's collection, issued for eight 
months in 1869, are rare because they were examples of the first two-color 
pictorial stamps ever printed in the United States. Before this series, 
stamps featured only the faces of dead presidents. The 12-cent-stamp 
was a green stamp depicting the steamship Adriatic. The 15-cent stamp 
had a brown-and-blue scene of Columbus' arrival in the New World. 
And the 24-cent stamp was a green-and-violet vignette of the famous 
Turnbull painting of the signing of the Declaration of Independence 
that is so detailed, Forster said, that with the help of a magnifying 
glass it is possible to distinguish the faces of the signers. ``When 
these stamps came out, people hated them,'' Laurence said. ``They 
didn't like the two colors and they thought it was inappropriate to 
put pictures on stamps. But collectors loved them from the moment 
they were printed.'' Forster's collection was also rare, he said, 
because the stamps are affixed to their original envelopes, and many 
of them traveled to exotic corners of the world, including Natal, 
the South African province, and St. Helena, the South Atlantic island 
where Napoleon died in exile. Often the letters took weeks to reach 
their destinations, making stops at several international post offices 
along the way. At each stop, the envelope would be stamped with a 
date and the name of the town. The more postal markings on a stamp 
and its envelope _ called a ``cover'' by philatelists _ the more valuable 
it is to the collector. Forster said one of the most valuable pieces 
in his collection, an item valued at $50,000 to $60,000, is a bright 
yellow 10-cent stamp, with an eagle on a shield, that is affixed to 
an envelope that was sent in 1870 from Rochester to a city in the 
old West German province of Baden called Bruchsal. The envelope had 
markings from post offices in New York City, Bremen and Bruchsal, 
where it arrived three weeks after it was mailed. Another valuable 
stamp in the Forster collection is the 90-cent stamp of President 
Lincoln, his image in carmine and black. ``Stamp collectors do this 
because it's fun,'' said Laurence, himself a collector for 50 years. 
``The hunt for rare items takes a lot of determination and dedication. 
It's a great way to learn about history, and a great way to learn 
about geography.'' There is also a financial incentive, he acknowledged. 
``The economics of it are quite good, too,'' he said. ``Rare stamps, 
over time, have held their value rather decisively.'' For his part, 
Forster said that while saddened by his loss, he will continue to 
hunt for gems on the corners of old envelopes. ``Stamp collecting 
is a passion for me,'' he said. ``Even though it's sort of a dark 
day right now, it will still remain a passion.''
