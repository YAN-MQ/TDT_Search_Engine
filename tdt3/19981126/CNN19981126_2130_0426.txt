The pacific northwest is recovering from its second strong storm system 
in three days. Heavy rain and strong winds set off mudslides, toppled 
trees, blew over mobile homes, and left many residents without power. 
Flood watches are in effect for several of Oregon's coastal counties. 
The rain is beginning to let up in the western part of the state, 
but high wind warnings remain in effect for the southern Oregon coast.
