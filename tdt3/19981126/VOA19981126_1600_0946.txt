The United Nations has warned that the number of severely malnourished 
people in the world is rising. In a report, the Rome-based UN Food 
and Agriculture Organization says, an estimated 828 million people 
suffer chronic malnutrition, in developing countries in 1994 through 
1996. That is an increase from the earlier 1990s. The UN Agency says 
Asia has the highest number of people who are malnourished, while 
Africa has the highest percentage of the population that is undernourished. 
The 1996 World Food Summit set a goal of cutting the number of hungry 
people in half by the year 2015.
