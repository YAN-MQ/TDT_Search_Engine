Time now for our geography stumper. We're looking for the site of 
the third largest pyramid in the world, but we're nowhere near Egypt. 
No, no, no. We are in fact just 30 miles northeast of what's now downtown 
Mexico City. The Pirami De Del Sol or the Pyramid of the Sun, stands 
230 feet high. In the sixth century, it was at the heart of the region's 
biggest city, a city that a hundred years later would be abandoned. 
So what's the name of this city? Well, we'll discover it in just a 
few minutes. And timely as ever, we'll also discover a link between 
this place and your Thanksgiving dinner.
