Augusto Pinochet broke down and cried upon learning he faces the threat 
of extradition to Spain and trial on charges of genocide, torture 
and terrorism, Spanish newspapers reported Thursday. Half an hour 
before a five-judge panel of Britain's House of Lords announced Wednesday 
that Pinochet has no immunity from prosecution, a government interpreter 
went to the London hospital where the former Chilean dictator is staying 
under police guard and broke the news to him. The interpreter read 
the ruling to Pinochet in Spanish, and repeated it once at Pinochet's 
request. Then Pinochet, who turned 83 on Wednesday, held his head 
in his hands and wept, El Pais reported from London, quoting sources 
close to the Pinochet affair. Another paper, El Mundo, also reported 
that Pinochet sobbed when he got the news. Earlier in the day Pinochet 
supporters tried to make his birthday as festive as possible at the 
Grovelands Priory hospital, delivering a cake they'd kept fresh in 
a large portable refrigerator. Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish 
warrant in London on Oct. 16 as he recovered from minor back surgery. 
In Madrid, the judge who issued that warrant and has requested his 
extradition reacted to the Lords' ruling with the silence that has 
become his trademark. Baltasar Garzon, dubbed Super Judge for taking 
on a string of high profile cases in Spain, made no public statement 
on the ruling. Even in the privacy of his office he did not so much 
as express satisfaction because he feared this would show bias, El 
Pais said, quoting sources close to Garzon. Garzon wants Pinochet 
to stand trial in Spain over the deaths or disappearances of more 
than 3,000 people during his regime. Spanish newspaper editorials 
welcomed the British Lords' ruling as a precedent-setting one that 
should send shivers down the spine of retired despots around the world. 
``As of yesterday, dictators who have lost power will no longer enjoy 
freedom of movement outside their country. They will have to stay 
home, or risk being arrested,'' El Pais said. The center-right daily 
El Mundo added: ``The foundations of what can and should be justice 
without borders are being laid.''
