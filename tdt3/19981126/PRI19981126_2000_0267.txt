In one week, the Space Shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to blast off. 
The six-member crew is carrying with it the second part of the international 
space station. Pat Duggins of member station WMFE reports. The first 
space station construction flight means the astronauts will be handling 
two very big objects. The Zarium compartment now in orbit is the size 
of a school bus and it weighs over 40,000 pounds on Earth. The shuttle 
will carry up to the unity compartment which weighs 25,000 pounds. 
Astronaut commander Bob Cabana says the station can be seen from Earth 
as a star moving across the nighttime sky. I really envy those future 
commanders that are going to take the space shuttle up and dock with 
it. So it's going to have a small beginning here on our flight but 
it's going to grow to something that's pretty immense. Russian ground 
controllers are working on antenna problems on Zarium. Humidity inside 
the craft is also higher than expected. Endeavour's lift off is set 
for December 3rd. For NPR News, I'm Pat Duggins in Orlando.
