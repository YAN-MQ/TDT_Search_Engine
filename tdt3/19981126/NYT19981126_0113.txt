Q. (italics)I recently received a promotion, but my new boss dislikes 
me and has been verbally abusive, to the point of using an obscene 
term to describe me in front of my colleagues. (I reported the incident 
to the department head.) Obviously, this behavior can't go on. What 
are my rights? Can I sue?(end italics) A. In America, everyone has 
the right to sue. You could claim defamation of character or infliction 
of emotional harm. With luck, Judge Judy would hear your case on TV. 
But that wouldn't necessarily solve the problem. Your recent promotion 
indicates that your grievance isn't with the company, but with the 
cretin to whom you've been assigned. You need to target your counterattack 
more precisely than with a lawsuit. In short, it's time to get personal. 
First, do a little detective work, advises Joel Neuman, director of 
the Center for Applied Management at the State University of New York 
at New Paltz. ``Is this common?'' he asked. ``Has your manager done 
this to others?'' If so, you have additional ammunition for your case. 
If not, you may find that your boss has short-term personal problems 
that are making him hot-tempered. After sizing up the situation, confront 
your tormentor privately (and quickly, since you've spoken to the 
department head). When you aren't in the heat of the moment, the two 
of you just might be able to resolve _ or at least clarify _ the problem. 
The step you've already taken _ going over your boss' head _ should 
have been a last resort. The outcome is rarely happy; the sad reality 
is that management (like the rest of us) often suffers from an us-versus-them 
mentality, and just finding a senior person to back you up can be 
a nightmare. For instance, if the department head hired and trained 
your nemesis, he's probably your boss' ally, said Gary Namie, a psychologist 
in Benicia, Calif., who started the Campaign Against Workplace Bullying. 
In that case, you'll need to go even higher up the chain of command. 
Assuming that you find a sympathetic ear, take care when outlining 
your complaint. Don't expect management to take you seriously if you 
get all weepy. Lay out your case as impersonally as possible and try 
to show how the situation is hurting the department's performance, 
Namie said. Wonder aloud whether your boss' actions have become apparent 
to customers or are undermining staff morale. To avoid the your-word-against-his 
trap, try to round up witnesses. Most employees will be less than 
eager to get involved, but you can probably convince a few to confirm 
public incidents. Your boss' habit of carrying on like a deranged 
harpy in front of others should make this easier. Of course, even 
if you succeed and your boss is reprimanded, you can expect relations 
to worsen radically. Consider pushing for reassignment to a new manager 
or division. Barring that, it may be time to start thinking about 
moving on. If you thought your boss was unpleasant to begin with, 
just wait until he learns that you've squealed. Michelle Cottle is
