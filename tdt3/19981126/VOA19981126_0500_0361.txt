Former Chilean Leader Augusto Pinochet has lost his legal battle as 
Britain's High Court has ruled three to two against giving him immunity 
from extradition. VOA's Laurie Casman is in London where the news 
brought cheers as well as jeers. The cheering erupted outside the 
House of Lords as soon as the ruling against Mr. Pinochet became clear. 
Chilean exiles in the crowd could not hold back their tears of joy. 
This is wonderful. This is just wonderful. It's it's very difficult 
to say anything because and it's just all emotion memories. It's a 
victory for the future of the humanity. Never again if happened, it 
will happen again. If there's any justice in this world, this is the 
only that it could be given. Relatives of victims of Mr. Pinochet's 
government warned the Former General he must go to trial. The ruling 
to deprive Mr. Pinochet of immunity now opens the way to his possible 
extradition to Spain. Britain's Home Secretary, the countries Justice 
Minister will have to decide on that action by next Wednesday. The 
Spanish Judge wants him to face charges of the torture, murder and 
disappearance of thousands of Chilean's and other nationals after 
he seized power in a bloody 1973 coup. Other European nations including 
France and Switzerland has also requested Mr. Pinochet's extradition 
on similar charges. Human Rights Watch calls the ruling a wake up 
call for tyrants around the world. Amnesty International sees it as 
a land mark break through against impunity. Chilean's and Human Rights 
Activists demonstrating in front of the House of Lords call it a victory 
for the Chilean people. Not everyone welcomes the ruling, however. 
Former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, a friend of the 
Former General, says that Mr. Pinochet should be allowed to go home. 
In Santiago, Mr. Pinochet's son calls the verdict a sadistic and cruel 
blow on his father's 83rd birthday. Laurie Casman, VOA News, London.
