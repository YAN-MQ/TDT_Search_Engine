birth control pills. New evidence shows there is a very real danger 
when women combine taking the pill and smoking. Studies show the combination 
increases risk of heart attack. And the older you are, the more the

who don't. A similar relationship seems to exist among smoking, oral 
contraceptives and stroke. For the latest health news online, check
