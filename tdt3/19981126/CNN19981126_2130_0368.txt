Memorial services are pending for entertainer flip Wilson. His assistant 
says Wilson died of liver cancer at his home in Malibu, california, 
yesterday. He was 64. Wilson made his Mark as a comedian who defied 
racial barriers to become the first African-American host of a top 
television variety show. His friends are remembering him with fondness. 
There was a gentleness -- a gentle quality to his work. He could occasionally 
give a squeal and a little cute flip. It's interesting I used the 
word cute, because comedy itself is only rarely cute. Especially these 
days, it's often very harsh and aggressive, and, to use a Cliche, 
mean-spirited. But flip Wilson never worked that way. There was always 
a gentleness, a sweetness, and, I repeat, a cuteness in work. I wish 
we had more like him today. Wilson underwent surgery last month for 
a malignant tumor close to his liver.
