A widow clutched a sack of donated rice, beans and oil, relieved that 
she will be able to feed her five children this month without begging 
for handouts. Constance Nthambui Mutinda, 39, said she has struggled 
to care for her family since her husband was killed in the terrorist 
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya on Aug. 7. ``Well-wishers and 
friends have been helping us, but as time goes on, they are giving 
less and less,'' Mutinda said. The Red Cross, in a first distribution, 
gave food Thursday to 100 families who lost a breadwinner in the blast, 
which killed 213 people, including a dozen Americans. Another 11 people 
were killed in a nearly simultaneous attack on the U.S. Embassy in 
Tanzania. U.S. authorities believe Osama bin Laden, Saudi exile and 
militant Muslim, masterminded the bombings. Three alleged co-conspirators 
are already jailed in New York. All families who lost a relative in 
the bombing, regardless of their economic status, will receive food 
from the Red Cross for the next eight months. ``Most of these families 
are desperate,'' said Marion Weigel of the International Federation 
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Each family received 40 kilograms 
(90 pounds) of rice, 4 kilograms (10 pounds) of beans, and 2 kilograms 
(5 pounds) of cooking oil. The next parcels will be provided in two 
weeks, Weigel said. Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow said in the aftermath 
of the bombing, needs have only intensified. Among families that lost 
breadwinners, some are now homeless, he said. Many of the more than 
5,400 people wounded in the blast still need surgery, which they cannot 
afford. Some need training to adjust to being sightless or maimed. 
``We are not going to fix their problems today or next week or next 
month,'' Sparrow said. ``We will need ongoing vigilance and commitment.'' 
The Kenya Red Cross, supported by the federation, already is helping 
people who need surgery and care that is beyond their means, providing 
training to people with disabilities, and ensuring orphans have money 
to continue their educations. The Red Cross aims to help 1,000 people 
in the next year. Kenya Red Cross official Wambui Kairo said initially 
friends and relatives generously supported bombing victims, but more 
than three months later they are attending to their own needs, many 
of which are severe in Kenya's steadily worsening economy. ``You can 
give for only so long if you have, and if you don't have, you can't 
give,'' Kairo said. Mutinda said she's right _ even the church where 
her husband was an elder has begun to lose interest. ``From next month, 
I don't know how I will pay the rent,'' the housewife said. Mutinda 
is unwilling to touch the 100,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 1,670) in 
death benefits she has stashed in the bank, although she is due to 
collect another 300,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 5,000). ``It is a lot 
of money, but not if you don't know where your next money is coming 
from,'' the widow said.
