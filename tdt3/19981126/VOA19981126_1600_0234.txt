Israel says it will revue its troop presence in Lebanon following 
an upsurge in casualties from guerrilla attacks in the occupied border 
strip. Two Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday night by a bomb 
planted by Hezbollah guerrillas. Three Israeli soldiers were killed 
last week. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says, Israel will 
not leave Lebanon until it is sure of two things: that the region 
won't be a base for attacks, and that Israel's local militia allies 
will be safe.
