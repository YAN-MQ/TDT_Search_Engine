More than 3,250 new cases of HIV have been registered in Russia this 
year, and 90 percent of those who contracted the virus were intravenous 
drug users, the health minister said Thursday. The new cases bring 
the total number of people with HIV in Russia to 10,283, including 
418 children, Health Minister Vladimir Starodubov said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. More than 220 Russians have died of AIDS 
since the disease was first detected here in 1987, including 77 children, 
Starodubov said. Russian officials warn that the actual number of 
HIV cases may be up to 10 times higher, as Russia still lacks comprehensive 
diagnostic and treatment programs. While this year's figure appear 
to mark a decrease in new HIV cases from 1997, when 4,300 new cases 
were registered, Starodubov warned that the virus may spread faster 
in the next few years if living standards continue to decline, bringing 
a rise in drug use and prostitution. Officials say more than 90 percent 
of people testing positive for HIV are intravenous drug users who 
have caught the virus through infected syringes.
