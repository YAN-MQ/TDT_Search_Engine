Millions of Americans are enjoying platefuls of food today. But how 
can you make sure you don't overdo it? Dr. Steve Salvatore has some 
tips. It's likely a Turkey won't be the only thing stuffed this holiday. 
If you're like most people, you're probably going to overindulge this 
thanksgiving. My family's big on food, so -- especially my grandma. 
Like you can't get enough of food. She keeps feeding you and feeding 
you. Thanksgiving began as a harvest celebration shared by the pilgrims 
and native Americans. Today's Thanksgiving is slightly different. 
We've really forgotten the meaning of some of these holidays. So everything 
is about how much food we can put on a table at one time. But why 
so much food? We use food to show nurturing and love and wealth and 
health and things like that. Experts say overindulging can be dangerous 
for diabetics or those on strict diets. But for the most healthy Americans 
who decide to overdo it this thanksgiving, it's not likely to cause 
problems, except for maybe a Stomachache and a bad case of the guilts. 
Experts say you can avoid the stomachache by being selective. If you 
love the stuffing, go for it. If you love the pecan Pie, go for it. 
Make sure that you eat what you really love, but don't overeat on 
the other things. If you do overindulge -- and you know you will -- 
here are some tips to help you out. Go for a walk. Fresh air is best, 
but if you can't go outside, just walk around the house for a bit. 
You don't have to do a lot of exercise to feel better. Brush your 
teeth. Sometimes changing the taste in your mouth can freshen you 
up. Chew some gum. This is especially helpful if you're party hopping. 
If you're chewing gum, experts say you're less likely to put food 
in your mouth. And lastly, pace yourself. If you loaded up on dinner, 
wait awhile before dessert or eat a small portion. These tips might 
help your stomach, but they won't do much for the guilt. Experts say 
you really shouldn't feel guilty. If you've enjoyed it, you shouldn't 
feel guilty. But you don't have to overdo it to enjoy it, and I think 
that's the key. That may be the key, but I'll probably overdo it anyway.
