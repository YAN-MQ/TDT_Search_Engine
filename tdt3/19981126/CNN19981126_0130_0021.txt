Guess what? Michael J. fox has spent virtually his entire adult life 
in the public eye, starting at age 21, when he landed the role of 
alex Keaton on the hugely successful sitcom "family ties." Now at 
37, the star of ABC's "spin city" goes public with his private battle 
with Parkinson's disease. The star of the "back to the future" series 
of films, fox broke the news in an eight-page cover story in the December 
7th issue of "people" magazine, revealing that in 1991, while on the 
set of the movie "doc Hollywood," fox noticed a twitch on his left 
pinkie, which was diagnosed as Parkinson's disease, a degenerative 
neurological disorder. According to the article, fox said over the 
next few years, the disease progressed and his entire left side suffered 
from stiffness and tremors, along with a violent shaking of his left 
arm. Through his spokesman, he told CNN -- Fox is married to actress 
Tracy pollan and, together, they have three children. According to 
the magazine, in March, fox underwent brain surgery, which has almost 
completely eliminated his worst tremors. Fox tells "people" magazine 
he continues to treat the disease with medication to control his milder 
symptoms. According to fox's spokesman -- fox says he went public 
because he thinks he can help people by talking. Jim Moret, CNN, Los
