KHANNA, India (AP) _ ``Cut off my legs! Cut off my hands! Just save 
me.'' The pathetic shriek came from a passenger _ one of many _ trapped 
in the wreckage hours after an express train collided Thursday with 
the toppled cars of another train that had derailed moments before 
in rural northwest India. Daylight was still hours away when neighbors 
arrived at the crash site, where at least 86 people were killed and 
250 wounded among the 1,700 passengers on the two trains. The townspeople 
of Khanna, a wheat marketing town five kilometers (three miles) away, 
were among the first to reach the site of the crash. ``My neighbors 
and I rushed there immediately,'' said Shiv Kumar, who sells bathroom 
fittings. ``I took three flasks of tea and 50 loaves of bread.'' ``Our 
first priority was to rescue people. And they needed comfort.'' Many 
residents took off their sweaters or shawls and offered them to passengers, 
many of whom were dressed in night clothes or had lost their belongings. 
``I saw one woman still trapped inside. Her legs are dangling from 
the compartment, but they are not able to rescue her because the compartment 
is at the bottom,'' Kumar told The Associated Press by telephone. 
Kumar joined hundreds of others in pulling out people from the coaches. 
Volunteers took them to hospitals in cars, motorscooters and tractors, 
or tried to help them find their families. ``I found one boy crying 
in the Frontier Mail. His father, mother and sister were in another 
compartment, in the front. He was at the back and escaped unhurt.'' 
Kumar drove the 13-year-old Sunil Gupta to three hospitals in nearby 
towns. ``We couldn't find his relatives. I brought him back to the 
government hospital in Khanna. Maybe they will show up.''
