US and Chinese researchers say they have found a fossil of what's 
believed to be the world's oldest known flower. The Researchers report 
their finding in the Journal Science. They say the fossil flower was 
found in sediment in northeastern China. They think the flowering 
plant is about 150 million years old. Previously the oldest known 
such specimen was dated to about 130 million years ago. The researchers 
speculate that the plant is related to sea ferns. Many peleobotonists 
thought flowering plants originated in tropical regions of the world, 
but the new finding suggests otherwise.
