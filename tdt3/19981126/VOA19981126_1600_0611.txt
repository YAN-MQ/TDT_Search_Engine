Meanwhile violence continued in the West Bank where Israeli soldiers 
near the town of Janine clashed with hundreds of Palestinian protesters. 
The protesters were demanding the release of Palestinian political 
prisoners held in Israeli jails. Witnesses say the soldiers fired 
rubber bullets at the crowd after the protesters broke through a Palestinian 
barricade and approached the joint Palestinian/Israeli Liaison Office. 
Two demonstrators were wounded in the clash. Palestinian activists 
have been angry that Israel released only 100 political prisoners, 
among the 250 people freed last Friday, as part of its commitments 
under the Wye River Peace Agreement.
