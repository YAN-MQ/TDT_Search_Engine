Former head of the Yugoslav Army, Moncello Parischech, has denounced 
President Slobodan Milosevic's decision to dismiss him. The general 
has previously criticized the way that the Yugoslav president has 
handled the crisis in Kosovo. From Belgrade, Jackie Roland reports. 
General Parischech said his dismissal was illegal, since proper consultations 
did not take place. His outspoken criticism of Yugoslavia's leaders 
at the height of the Kosovo crisis probably hastened his departure. 
President Milosevic appears to be purging his inner circle of any 
potential critics at a time when he is feeling increasingly isolated 
on the international scene. Jackie Roland, BBC News, Belgrade.
