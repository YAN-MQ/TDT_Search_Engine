CNN has learned democrats on the house Judiciary committee have some 
more questions for independent counsel Starr. They sent him a letter 
yesterday with 19 follow-up questions to his 12-hour testimony before 
the committee last week. Among other things, the letter asks about 
the resignation of Starr's ethics adviser, Sam dash. Democrats also 
want Starr to provide a list of clients he has represented as a private 
lawyer since he became independent counsel.
