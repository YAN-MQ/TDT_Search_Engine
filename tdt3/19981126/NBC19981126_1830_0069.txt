Good evening. On this traditional day of thanks, millions of Americans 
are celebrating. The country has plenty to be thankful for -- a healthy 
economy, relative peace and stability, despite some political turmoil. 
But this Thanksgiving day we are also reminded of the thousands of 
americans who are far away from home, and family, as well as those 
in desperate need. We begin with NBC's Bob Faw. We gather together 
to ask the lord's blessings. On this day, hymns of Thanksgiving and 
praise rang out through the land. Inasmuch as the great father has 
given us this year an abundant harvest -- In the week when the stock 
market hit a record high, America showed its gratitude. But America 
also strutted. At Macy's parade, to kick off the holiday shopping 
season, streetlights this year were turned sideways, huge floats tied 
down tighter, but nothing could stop a drenching rain. There were 
brighter skies in Birmingham, in St. Louis and Detroit, where the 
bands also played on. Plymouth rock, where Thanksgiving began, hosted 
another kind of parade -- by American Indians. Commemorating what 
they call the "national day of mourning." The United States has never 
honored one treaty with indigenous people. Mostly though, it was a 
time for tradition. 45 million turkeys gobbled down today, the national 
Turkey federation estimates. 6900 American troops, served all the 
trimmings in Bosnia. 800 people served at this falls church, Virginia, 
church. 24,000, many homeless, provided for in San Antonio. Another 
30,000 free meals in Atlanta's home of the Braves. Feeding all these 
hungry and homeless people is evidence of the true level of our economic 
situation. For a country fed up and worn down by political crisis, 
today was also an opportunity not just for those in need, but for 
those who volunteered to help them out. It's just doing something 
on Thanksgiving day to try to be helpful to others, those who need 
help. That's just what the spirit of Thanksgiving ought to be about. 
a spirit which prevailed this day when America slowed down, came together, 
and gave thanks. Bob Faw, NBC news, Washington.
