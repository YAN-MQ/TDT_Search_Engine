In southeast Asia today, new rioting in Indonesia, as the people of 
that country fight for more democracy. In the last year, the government 
has been overthrown and the economy has collapsed. Poverty is spreading, 
food shortages are a way of life in the world's fourth most populace 
nation. And no one is feeling this more than Indonesia's children. 
NBC's Ned Colt on a generation in danger. On a hill of garbage, Indonesia's 
children struggling to survive, battling clouds of flies and a terrible 
stench. 11-year-old sardi is a scavenger -- picking plastic, paper, 
and glass to recycle. 20 baskets a week, 5 cents a basket. It's difficult 
for me. I'd like to have another job. But this is all there is. Sardi's 
money goes to buy food. His mother needs every cent. Food prices have 
tripled. Indonesia has been hardest hit in the economic meltdown sweeping 
across asia. Every day, 15,000 people losing their jobs. 50 million, 
one in four so poor they can't even buy enough rice to feed their 
families. For other children, the only way to fill their stomachs 
is to sweep up spilled rice at the market, or by begging in the streets. 
Many aren't getting enough. The U.N. says half the children here under 
2 are malnourished, facing hunger now that will lead to developmental 
problems later. The problem of malnutrition leading to decreases in 
mental abilities is well documented. We will see a generation that 
is not as competitive in the global economy. Another risk -- disease. 
When the economy collapsed, so did the health care system. Vaccinations, 
checkups all cost money. Very few can afford them. Health experts 
fear outbreaks of measles, Polio and tuberculosis. With children at 
such great risks, school is an afterthought. Sardi's family struggles 
to keep him in class. In the last year, fully one in three Indonesian 
children dropped out. What are their prospects? Very unlikely they'll 
ever go back to school. They'll become street workers, street kids. 
They might end up in hazardous labor. Their futures are seriously 
comp row moyzed. As for sardi, he still has hope. I want to be an 
engineer. It would be easier than this. But for a generation of Indonesian 
children, many fear the future may already be lost. Ned Colt, NBC 
news, Jakarta.
