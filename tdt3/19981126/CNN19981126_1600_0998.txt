Many car owners buy higher octane gasoline, even though the government 
says cheaper, regular grade gasoline is just as effective. U.S. retailers 
say sales of higher grade gasoline is skyrocketing amid the lowest 
fuel prices in years. The national average price for a gallon of regular

premium is just under $1.18.
