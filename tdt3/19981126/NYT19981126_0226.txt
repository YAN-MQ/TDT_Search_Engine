American rap stars have attracted big audiences in Europe for years, 
so it was not entirely surprising that teen-agers in the small southwest 
German town of Boeblingen lined up along the street Thursday morning 
to see Coolio, whose hits include ``Gangsta's Paradise.'' But this 
was no ordinary stop on a concert tour. For rap-enchanted teen-agers, 
it was a chance to get an autograph. For the stolidly middle-class 
residents of Boeblingen, Thursday marked a real encounter with renegade 
American pop culture. In an event that people have been awaiting for 
months, Coolio arrived at the local courthouse to face trial on charges 
that he stole about $900 worth of clothes and assaulted a store clerk 
at a local boutique. The rap star has said it was all a misunderstanding; 
his lawyers are seeking an out-of-court settlement. It was, they say, 
a promotional deal with the boutique that went awry. But the boutique 
is pressing charges, and this town has not been as electrified in 
years. The police cordoned off the street in front of the local courthouse 
in preparation for Coolio's arrival. Hundreds of teen-agers showed 
up, and television crews from around Germany came to record the event. 
The courtroom audience was split almost evenly between teen-agers 
in baggy jeans and journalists. ``The things we usually write about 
are garbage incinerators,'' said Siegfried Dannecker, an editor at 
Boeblinger Kreiszeitung, the town newspaper. ``I don't think we have 
ever seen such a mass of media representatives in a Boeblingen courtroom. 
Our paper is suddenly selling to an age group we usually don't reach.'' 
Coolio himself showed little anxiety as he showed up for his day in 
court. Dressed in a black shirt and pin-striped black suit, he stomped 
out a cigarette outside the courthouse and signed hundreds of autographs 
before walking in. ``Coolio wants the world to know that this is just 
a big misunderstanding,'' said Bill Harris, the rap singer's tour 
manager, who seemed amazed by the fuss. ``For the most part, he's 
innocent. I think this was a little hyped up by the media.'' By American 
standards, the alleged crime probably would not rate much more than 
a mention on ``Entertainment Tonight.'' But in Germany, where people 
follow rules with excruciating precision and violent crime is unusual 
in small towns, it immediately became a big story. The event in question, 
as the police might say, took place almost exactly one year ago. Coolio 
and several band members arrived at the boutique for a promotional 
autograph-signing session. The musicians have said they were upset 
by what they considered the low pay offered by the boutique. The store 
owners charged that the rappers started to grab clothing as a way 
to get even and injured a store clerk who tried to stop them. Lawyers 
for the singer have already settled a civil lawsuit with the store 
for about $2,900, but prosecutors have pressed ahead with the criminal 
case. If convicted, Coolio could face a jail term but would almost 
certainly be put on probation. He is scheduled for one more day of 
trial next month. ``Coolio has never faced charges in court, and this 
is a foreign country,'' said the singer's attorney, Georg Strasser. 
``It is all very new for him. I am hoping that this can be settled 
with a payment to a charitable organization.'' Older residents expressed 
more alarm. ``There are so many women working here alone, and they 
are already scared,'' said Angela Erhart, a saleswoman in her late 
40s at a store next to the boutique that hired Coolio. ``I am sure 
that the woman there felt threatened.'' Though Thursday was a normal 
school day in Germany, about 200 teen-agers were on hand at the courthouse 
to catch a glimpse of the excitement and debate the merits of the 
case. ``I don't know exactly what happened, but I think Coolio was 
right because the people in the store refused to pay him,'' said Murat 
Dinar, 17, a student dressed in baggy jeans and an oversized blue 
jacket. ``I would have done the same thing.'' But while rap music 
has a passionate following, even in small towns like Boeblingen, many 
teen-agers were critical of the singer. ``If he did what they say 
he did, then it was wrong,'' said Anika Schaffer, 16. ``He has enough 
money to buy the clothes.'' Others suspected that both the store and 
the rap singer were simply using the case to generate publicity. ``I 
think this whole story is just a big promotional move,'' said Jens 
Schuetz, a blond 17-year-old wearing baggy jeans and a baseball hat. 
``Look how many hits he had during the last few years: basically none.'' 
It is hard to overstate the allure that rap and hip-hop music hold 
for teen-agers across Europe. Many fans revel in the fact that it 
is inscrutable to their parents and makes for good dancing.
