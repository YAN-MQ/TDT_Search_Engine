Lawyers for jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim said Thursday they would 
ask a court to free him on bail because he was not well. Attorney 
Sankaran Nair said an application for bail had been filed in court 
and would be heard Saturday. ``Normally in cases like these, medical 
conditions are always a basis to ask for bail,'' Nair told reporters. 
Anwar's bail application has been turned down by a lower court once 
and an appeal against it also failed. Trial Judge Augustine Paul said 
Anwar's lawyers weren't able to prove that he would not tamper with 
witnesses if released on bail. Anwar suffers from a stomach disorder 
that causes intense heartburn, family members have said. Although 
he does not appear to be in physical pain during his court appearances, 
his lawyers say his condition has worsened. Anwar was arrested Sept. 
20 under a special security law only hours after organizing a mammoth 
rally in the capital. During that protest, he called for sweeping 
government reforms and the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad. Mahathir sacked Anwar Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and 
finance minister after deeming him morally unfit to lead the Southeast 
Asian country. Anwar currently is standing trial on charges of abuse 
of power and sexual misconduct, charges he denies and calls politically 
motivated.
