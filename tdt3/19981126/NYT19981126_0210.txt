There was a time when Ed Cota was a scoring machine. He would penetrate 
and finish with dazzling layups, and make jump shots from all over 
the court. More than a few observers said Cota, who averaged 31 points 
at Tilden High School in Brooklyn and 21 points at St. Thomas More 
Academy in Montville, Conn., could not be stopped. Then Cota, a highly 
recruited prep all-American, enrolled at North Carolina _ and was 
stopped. ``That's when my scoring average went way down,'' Cota said 
with a laugh, moments after scoring 11 points Wednesday in ninth-ranked 
North Carolina's 54-47 victory over Purdue at Madison Square Garden. 
``I used to score a lot before I came to Carolina, but when my scoring 
average went down it wasn't a problem because I just like winning.'' 
Now more Mark Jackson than Isiah Thomas, Cota is perhaps better at 
directing an offense than anyone else in the country. On Friday night 
he will bark calls, make assists and try to control the game's tempo 
in the hope of leading the Tar Heels (5-0) to a victory over No. 3 
Stanford (4-0) in the championship game of the Chase Preseason National 
Invitation Tournament. St. John's (3-1) will face Purdue (4-1) in 
the consolation game. After watching Cota play, it is easy to see 
why Magic Johnson is one of the athletes he most admires. At 6 feet 
1 inch, Cota is 8 inches shorter than Johnson, but he possesses the 
same love of teamwork and unselfishness that made the former Los Angeles 
Lakers star so special. That quality makes Cota, who was raised in 
the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, stand out among today's shoot-first, 
pass-second point guards. In two seasons with the Tar Heels, Cota, 
a junior, has placed his name atop the North Carolina assists list, 
which includes Phil Ford and Kenny Smith. The Atlantic Coast Conference 
assists leader the past two years, Cota has a career average of 7.3 
a game, dwarfing the Tar Heels' next highest mark _ 6.1, by Ford. 
His 7.4 average last season was a school single-season record. Cota's 
love for passing is obvious this season. He understandably averaged 
only 8 points as a freshman and sophomore, because Antawn Jamison 
and Vince Carter, who were selected fourth and fifth, respectively, 
in the NBA draft in June, did most of the Tar Heels' shooting and 
scoring. But with graduation and the draft taking their toll on the 
roster, Cota came into this season as the club's leading returning 
scorer. It was thought that he would have to increase his scoring 
dramatically for the Tar Heels to remain among the nation's elite 
teams, but with two freshmen and a previously little-used sophomore 
in the starting five, Cota has chosen to lift North Carolina the way 
he always has _ via the pass. While his average has risen to 11.4 
points a game, Cota enters Friday's game as North Carolina's third-leading 
scorer this season (behind center Brendan Haywood's 14.4 points a 
game and forward Ademola Okulaja's 11.6). And despite not having a 
big scorer on the club, Cota is averaging 9.2 assists a game. ``My 
game's not going to change,'' Cota said. ``I'm going to still do what 
I'm capable of doing out there _ get everybody involved and score 
at the times when I have to. I'm not looking to come into the game 
saying, `I'm going to score 20,' or anything like that. Whatever the 
defense gives me, I'll take. And as long as we win, that's all that 
counts.'' With a young, inexperienced team, Cota and Tar Heel Coach 
Bill Guthridge admitted there would be nights when Cota would have 
to step out of his traditional point guard mode and revert to taking 
opponents to the hoop. When that time comes, Cota will be ready. ``I 
know that in the future I'm going to have to score more,'' he said. 
``And that won't be a problem.''
