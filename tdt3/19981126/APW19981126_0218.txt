Russia's nuclear weapons are reaching the end of their service life, 
leaving Moscow no alternative but to ratify the START II arms reduction 
treaty with the United States, a senior military official said. Fifty-eight 
percent of Russia's strategic missiles are past their expiration date, 
Gen. Anatoly Perminov, the chief of staff of Russia's strategic missile 
forces, said in an interview with the military daily Krasnaya Zvezda, 
or Red Star. Military satellites, which monitor missile sites and 
collect intelligence data, are also growing old, with nearly 70 percent 
of them past their service life, he said. Perminov said the military 
was carrying out a modernization program that would allow it to extend 
the life of 200 missiles until the year 2007. However, that wouldn't 
solve the force's overall problem and he stressed that Russia must 
build new single-warhead Topol-M missiles to preserve its nuclear 
potential. The general said Russia must ratify the START II treaty, 
which would allow the country to reduce spending on its nuclear forces. 
``There is no alternative to strategic arms reduction,'' Perminov 
said. ``Because of that, the START II treaty will be ratified sooner 
or later.'' Other military officials have sounded a similar note, 
saying most Russian ballistic missiles won't be reliable in coming 
years regardless of whether the country signs the treaty. START II, 
which was signed in 1993, would halve Russian and American nuclear 
arsenals to about 3,500 warheads each. The U.S. Senate ratified it 
in 1996, but the Communist-led opposition in the Russian parliament 
has balked, claiming that dismantling strategic weapons would harm 
Russia's security and be too expensive. There's been some progress 
in recent weeks, and President Boris Yeltsin's government has made 
a renewed push to convince lawmakers to ratify the document. The Duma 
has agreed to speed up preparation for the debate, and many lawmakers 
have voiced optimism that the treaty can be ratified.
