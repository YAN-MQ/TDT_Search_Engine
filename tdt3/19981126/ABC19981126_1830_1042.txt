Americans don't give just money. Case in point -- central America 
hurricane Mitch and the massive amount of goods that have been contributed 
to for relief mostly in Honduras and nicaragua. Food, clothes, bedding 
by the planeload. It is one thing to good, it is another to give what's 
needed. When disaster struck Nicaragua and Honduras, their consulates 
in the U.S. put out urgent calls for help. I didn't know exactly how 
to do it, I just screamed for help, everywhere I went. And for weeks 
now, help has been pouring in. Mountains of it, from people who wanted 
to do something and reached for the nearest closet or pantry. But 
much of this aid is likely to go to waste. We have shoes, one is good, 
the other is not. Then we have old stuff like this. It's 3 years old. 
More canned stuff, we don't need this. We don't have can openers. 
So that's useless? It's useless. Sure enough, at the federal express 
building at the Honduras airport, boxes of canned goods are still 
piling up. To be realistic, what we need here is more grains. That's 
what the people eat every day. This sort of well-intentioned waste 
is common when private citizens do not work through experienced organizations 
that know how to meet a country's specific needs. At least that's 
the opinion of Richard Walden of operation USA. This is an antibiotic 
which is on a list of needed items in central america. This is what 
should be sent? yes. Okay. And what is this? This is from someone's 
medicine chest. They're half empty bottles of prescription drugs. 
Walden says sorting through donated goods to ferret out used pharmaceuticals 
and expired food is not a job for amateurs. Experts in the field of 
disaster relief, say the best way to give is through an organized 
charity and to give cash. That gives us the flexibility to purchase 
what is needed, when it's needed, and deliver it where it's needed. 
But if you really want to have a connection with an item, which I 
think is the emotional connect people have, then by all means, go 
buy a case of diapers, go buy a 50 or 100-pound sack of beans, and 
then we'll talk. In other words, emotion and compassion work best 
when they come in practical packages. Judy Muller, ABC News, Los Angeles. 
We should say there are plenty of people trying to help with money. 
In Wisconsin, the local red cross has received so much money for the 
victims of Mitch, they have fallen behind counting checks.
