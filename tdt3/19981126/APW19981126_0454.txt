After months of wrangling with management, Hong Kong Telecom staff 
agreed Thursday to a pay plan linked to work performance, the company 
said. Last week, the company _ one of Hong Kong's largest private 
employers, with a staff of 13,800 _ proposed a profit-related bonus 
scheme to workers earning more than 10,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
dlrs 1,282) a month. Under that plan, the workers would lose out if 
the company's operating profits rose by less than 3 percent. Hundreds 
of Hong Kong Telecom staff staged a sit-in outside company headquarters 
in protest. Hong Kong Telecom managers defused the situation by offering 
a new plan under which workers stand to get a smaller bonus _ one-quarter 
of a month's salary _ if profits rise by less than 3 percent. Many 
companies in Hong Kong give year-end bonuses equivalent to about one 
month's salary. The dispute began in September when Hong Kong Telecom 
first proposed pay cuts of 10 percent. Hong Kong Telecom later came 
up with its initial bonus plan, which workers called a pay cut in 
disguise.
