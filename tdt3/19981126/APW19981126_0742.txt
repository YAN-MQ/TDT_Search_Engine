Greece will hold talks with the Cypriot president on the fate of a 
controversial missile deployment that threatens to bring conflict 
to the divided island. Premier Costas Simitis said Thursday he will 
discuss the S-300 missile stalemate with Cypriot President Glafcos 
Clerides during his current visit to Greece. Purchased earlier this 
year, the missiles have been gathering dust in a Russian warehouse 
at a cost of dlrs one million a month until Cyprus decides what to 
do with them. They have twice postponed their deployment. Greece is 
said to favor a proposal to install the missiles on the Greek island 
of Crete, but Clerides fears such a decision could lead to his political 
demise. Simitis would not directly deny that the missiles could wind 
up on Crete. ``The S-300 are not an end in themselves. We will discuss 
and decide which course helps solve the problem,'' he said. Last week, 
Turkey's second highest-ranking general warned Greece that war would 
break out if Greek Cypriots set up the Russian-made missiles. Cyprus 
has been divided since Turkish forces invaded the northern third of 
the island to protect the Turkish minority following a short-lived 
coup by supporters of union with Greece in 1974. Turkey maintains 
about 30,000 troops in a northern break-away state, which is only 
recognized by Ankara. Greece has a defense pact with Greek Cypriots. 
``Greece's government agrees with Cyprus that it needs an effective 
defense. To do this they need some means. But they are not an end 
in themselves,'' Simitis explained during a news conference. Simitis, 
Clerides and their ministers of defense and foreign affairs will meet 
here Friday to discuss whether Cyprus will go ahead with the deployment 
of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. Although NATO allies, 
Greece and Turkey have nearly fought twice in the past 11 years over 
territorial disputes.
