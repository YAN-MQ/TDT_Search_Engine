Iraq's defiance of Washington brought most Arab nations to its side 
and proved that the United States was not the world's only superpower, 
President Saddam Hussein was quoted as saying Thursday. However, he 
said it did not matter if the ``feeble and weak'' Arab rulers did 
not support him during his standoff with the United States over U.N. 
weapons inspections. ``We are not frustrated if we fail to persuade'' 
Arab rulers to support Iraq in its fight against U.N. trade sanctions, 
state-run newspapers quoted Saddam as saying. Arab rulers were only 
thinking of staying in power, while he was concerned with Iraq's future 
and that of the Arab nations, Saddam said without mentioning any Arab 
ruler by name. He was apparently referring to the governments of the 
Arab Gulf states as well as Syria and Egypt which, during a conference 
in Qatar earlier this month, held Iraq ``responsible for any consequences'' 
for refusing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The United 
States on Nov. 14 called off air strikes after the Iraqi leader promised 
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan he would permit U.N. weapons inspectors 
to visit suspected weapons sites in Iraq. Lack of Arab support during 
the standoff apparently forced Iraq to make a quicker retreat. ``Those 
rulers are feeble and weak and no matter how many they are, they do 
not belong to the people,'' Saddam was quoted as saying Thursday. 
Many Arabs and Muslims, Saddam said, believed ``America had the power 
to give life and deny it.'' But Iraq's ``steadfastness'' made them 
rely on God instead, he added. He said he was certain he would emerge 
victorious in his defiance of America. ``Based on strong faith in 
God, the future is for Baghdad and not its enemies,'' he said.
