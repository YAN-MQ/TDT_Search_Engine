The lower house of parliament on Thurday approved a new pension system 
that makes retirement payments dependent on duration of employment 
and amount of contributions that will be split between state and private 
funds. The 460-member Sejm voted 194-123 with no abstentions to approve 
the plan, a vital element of Poland's reforms that do away with the 
remains of the communist-era administrative and social welfare structures. 
It is to take effect Jan. 1. The bill still needs the approval of 
the upper house and of President Aleksander Kwasniewski. The new plan 
offers working Poles the possibility of larger pensions than the current 
scheme, which provides meager payments not directly related to workers' 
contributions. It also will ease the burden on the strained national 
budget by eliminating subsidies for social security payments. Heavy 
subsidies to cover average payments of 720 zlotys (dlrs 205) a month 
- or 60 percent of the average wage - to 7.5 million pensioners amounted 
to 3.8 billion zlotys (dlrs 1.08 billion) in 1996, the same as total 
spending on culture and higher education. The plan guarantees state 
pensions for workers now over 50, but gives workers between 30 and 
50 the option of splitting their pension plans between state and private 
funds. Workers under 30 can chose between the state, private and mixed 
plans. Social security contributions would remain at the current level 
of 45 percent of the payroll, split equally between employer and employee. 
The new plan also sets strict retirement limits _ 65 years for men 
and 60 years for women _ and curtails earlier retirement. Last month, 
the United States offered dlrs 4.6 million for the Western-style pension 
reforms. The money funneled through the U.S. Agency for International 
Development by the year 2000 will be spent on an information campaign, 
training and supervision of funds.
