Firebombs exploded Thursday at the private office of Greece's justice 
minister, causing damage and slightly injuring a security guard, police 
said. A previously unknown group, calling itself Student Rebels, claimed 
responsibility for the attack in a call to an Athens newspaper. It 
claimed the justice minister, Evangelos Yannopoulos, was unfair to 
students. The explosion occurred while nearly 10,000 people joined 
a student-led march through central Athens to protest proposed education 
reforms, including replacing a single university entry exam with a 
series of tests. Marchers used gasoline-filled bottles to set fire 
to at least five cars, including one belonging to the Egyptian Embassy, 
police said. Students also clashed with police outside parliament. 
The attack on Yannopoulos' downtown Athens office was similar to more 
than 200 other arson strikes this year, including one earlier this 
month at a government labor office. Most have been claimed by small 
leftist groups. ``Such acts won't frighten anybody and Greeks are 
disgusted by them,'' Yannopoulos stated after visiting his office.
