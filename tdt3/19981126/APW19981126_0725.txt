Using high-level diplomacy and high-emotion lobbying, Canadians are 
campaigning to save the life of a man who on Dec. 10 is scheduled 
to become the first Canadian executed in the United States since 1952 
The case of Joseph Faulder, a former mechanic convicted in the stabbing 
and beating death of a 75-year-old Texas woman, has captured the attention 
of international human rights groups, the U.N. human rights commission 
and the Canadian government. Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy plans 
to press Canada's campaign for clemency when he meets U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright in Washington on Monday. Canada abolished 
the death penalty in 1976, and regularly seeks clemency for Canadians 
sentenced to death abroad. The Faulder case has generated especially 
intense feelings because many Canadians are critical of the high number 
of executions in the United States, particularly in Texas. Faulder 
has never claimed he is innocent in the 1975 death of Inez Phillips, 
the matriarch of an oil family who was fatally stabbed and bludgeoned 
during a botched robbery at her home in Gladewater, Texas. But those 
seeking clemency for Faulder have raised several issues which they 
say should persuade Texas Gov. George W. Bush to commute the execution. 
For the Canadian government, which filed a brief Wednesday with the 
U.S. Supreme Court, the key argument is that Texas authorities violated 
an international treaty affording all foreign suspects the right to 
contact their own governments for legal help. Faulder wasn't given 
the chance to speak with Canadian consular officials until 1991. Texas 
authorities said they had no idea Faulder was Canadian at the time 
of his arrest because he was using a Texas driver's license. Other 
critics of Faulder's sentence note that he was convicted as a result 
of a private prosecution, funded by Mrs. Phillips' son. Faulder, 61, 
grew up in Jasper, Alberta, but left his wife and children during 
the winter of 1974-75 and headed to the United States. He and a girlfriend 
robbed Mrs. Phillips' home on the mistaken belief that there was a 
large sum of money in her safe. He signed a confession after his arrest, 
and was convicted of murder in 1977. That conviction was overturned 
in 1979 because Faulder had no lawyers present for the confession, 
resulting in a second trial involving the private prosecutors. Faulder, 
who is sentenced to die by lethal injection at the state prison in 
Huntsville, granted an interview this month to the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corp. ``I don't say that I shouldn't be here,'' Faulder said. ``I 
say that death row should not exist. Period.'' He thanked the Canadians 
campaigning on his behalf, and added, ``I just want to let people 
know I am not a monster.'' Axworthy raised Faulder's case Wednesday 
with Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, during 
her visit to Canada. ``I'm very concerned about the circumstances 
of the Canadian and the fact that he did not have access to consular 
advice at an earlier stage,'' Robinson said. A delegation of Canadians 
opposed to capital punishment is leaving for Texas on Dec. 5 to ask 
Bush to commute Faulder's death sentence. The delegation will include 
Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the former boxer who spent 19 years in 
a New Jersey prison for a murder he didn't commit. Not all Canadians 
support the clemency campaign. Alberta's conservative premier, Ralph 
Klein, said of the Faulder case, ``Texas has its laws and when you 
commit the crime you know what the punishment is going to be.''
