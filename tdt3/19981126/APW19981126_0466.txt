Celebrity judges on Thursday finished interviewing 86 contestants 
for Miss World, just hours before one was to be crowned. As the first 
step in the Thursday evening finals, which will be televised live 
in 130 countries, each judge had 2 1/2 minutes with each candidate. 
``Outer beauty can fade, but inner beauty will last for life,'' said 
New Zealand All Black rugby star Jonah Lomu, a Miss World judge. Photographer 
Terry O'Neill said he was looking for ``bearing, beauty and nature.'' 
Among the other judges are Formula 1 racing driver Jacques Villeneuve; 
outgoing Miss World, India's Diana Hayden; model Christelle de St. 
Augustin; and Venezuela's 1981 Miss World Pilin Leon. Thursday's event 
was to be co-presented by the MTV hostess Eden and Ronan Keating, 
lead singer for the Irish pop group Boyzone, which will play its new 
single. Former Hot Chocolate singer Errol Brown was open the show 
with his hit ``You Sexy Thing.'' Controversy came to the contest this 
year with Croatia's entry, Lejla Sehovic, a business administration 
student stripped of her title by her country's Miss World franchise 
holder because she is a Muslim. Muslims are a minority among Croatia's 
4.7 million people. Judges voted a second time and awarded the crown 
to a Roman Catholic, Ivana Petkovic. But protests were so great, the 
crown was returned to Sehovic, with the proviso that Petkovic would 
represent Croatia next year. India's Annie Thomas, 23, said she sees 
herself as ``defending champion,'' taking advice from her compatriot, 
the current Miss World. South Africa's Kerishnie Naicker, 25, is one 
of the oldest candidates. A qualified pharmacist, she is now hosting 
two television shows, one on culture and races in her country, and 
the other promoting South Africa's food, wine and tourist attractions. 
She wants to be her country's health minister. The Seychelles government 
is hosting the show for the second year in a row in the hopes of promoting 
the country as a tourist destination.
