VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ended a rancorous year-end meeting Thursday 
without even a minimum agreement to extend oil production cuts, saying 
it would review the situation again in March. OPEC secretary-general 
Rilwanu Lukman said the organization will take whatever measures are 
necessary at that time to try to boost oil prices, but there will 
be no policy changes in the meantime. The reason for the failure to 
take action wasn't immediately announced, but the official meeting 
already had been pushed back from Wednesday because of the internal 
split. Analysts had said that extending production cuts to the end 
of 1999 was the bare minimum action needed to prop up rock-bottom 
oil prices, flirting with 12-year lows. Some delegates had voiced 
hope a 2.6 million barrel-a-day cut that the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries set in June to run for one year could be extended 
six months to the end of 1999. ``We have already got an agreement, 
you know,'' Lukman said. ``In March we will decide what to do.'' ``There's 
no question of the need to reduce'' output, he said. But when pressed 
on the issue, he said output levels were a question of opinion, and 
refused to elaborate. OPEC did decide to realign its annual meeting 
schedule, and will meet from now on in March and September rather 
than June and November, its secretary-general said afterward. Cartel 
president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, who also is the United Arab Emirates' 
oil minister, acknowledged in an opening speech to delegates that 
a ``strong bearish sentiment has set in'' on the world market.
