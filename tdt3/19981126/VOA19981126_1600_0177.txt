Thousands of mourners gathered Thursday in Tehran for the funeral 
of an Iranian opposition leader and his wife who were found murdered 
in their home, four days ago. VOA Middle East correspondent Scott 
Bob reports that Iranian authorities have launched an investigation 
into the crime. The mourners chanted slogans against despotism and 
in favor of freedom of thought at Thursday's funeral for dissident 
Dadiyush Paruhash and his wife Parvani. The couple were found stabbed 
to death last Sunday in their home. Iran's president has called for 
an urgent investigation. Police Thursday announced, they have arrested 
several suspects. The late Mr. Paruhash served as Labor Minister in 
the provisional government that followed the Iranian revolution, in 
1979. But he resigned to form his own party, deNation party which 
espoused nationalist secular ideals and opposed the Islamic government 
that later emerged. Scott Bob, VOA News, Middle East Bureau.
