By this evening hour on Thanksgiving day, just about everyone has 
probably reached their destination for the holiday. An estimated 35 
million of us traveled somewhere for Thanksgiving and most are probably 
already getting apprehensive about the trip home. Our next story is 
about a 77-year-old woman who has made travel her life for a very 
long time. If you have taken a flight any time the last 50 years or, 
so maybe you've seen her. Here's ABC's John Martin. Loretta Burke 
is an American living and working in Paris. She rides a bus to her 
job in the suburbs. Actually, it's at an airport. And this is her 
office, the cabin of a jetliner. In the event of an evacuation -- 
She started as a secretary at united airlines during the second world 
war. I had to sign a statement when I came in there that this was 
a temporary job. And I had to give it up when the boys came back from 
the service. So 55 years later, I'm in my temporary job. For stewardesses, 
as they were called, it was an age of daring and glamour. Two pilots 
and myself, it was very personal. Very small. Only 21 passengers. 
And you really worried for them. You looked out for them. They used 
to dress up. It was an occasion. Today, she says, passengers feel, 
well, different about flying. Now it's something they feel that has 
to be endured. They're a little grouchy when they get on. But grouchiness 
doesn't get them very far with Burke, the tough-as-nails daughter 
of a New York taxi driver. I can stare somebody down. I guess, they 
know I have a little seniority on them. I'm not intimidated by anybody. 
And certainly not intimidated by airline age restrictions, which she 
fought until vindicated, when Congress passed the age discrimination 
in employment act in 1967. What changed? The government changed it 
for them. Most of the airlines came kicking and screaming. They had 
a bad image there for a while in some of the airlines, like a Coffee, 
tea or me image. Today, Burke works with attendants young enough to 
be her grandchildren. What's it like? Well, I am who I am. I think 
I can work as well as they do. I'm sure of it. And so are passengers. 
This one kissed her as the flight arrived in Washington. Was he a 
friend? no. No, I hadn't met him. Just had a kind of a rapport. Nice 
gentleman. And a nice lady who says that in English and French, there 
is just one word she does not recognize. Retirement. John Martin, 
ABC News, Washington.
