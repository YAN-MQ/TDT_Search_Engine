The death toll remains -- topped 100 following a collision between 
two trains this morning in India. 250 others were injured after seven 
cars from one train jumped the tracks. Another train on a parallel 
track slammed into the derailed cars. 1,700 passengers were on both 
trains. It's India's worst train crash in three years.
