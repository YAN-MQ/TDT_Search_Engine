Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blare delivers an address to the Irish 
Parliament in Dublin today. The first by-British Prime Minister said 
Irish independence in 1922. Mr. Blare is to call for the two countries 
to put past animosities behind them and usher a new era of good will 
and cooperation. He is also expected to offer an optimistic assessment 
of prospects for peace in Northern Ireland.
