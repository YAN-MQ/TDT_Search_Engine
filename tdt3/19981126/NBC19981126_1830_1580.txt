And finally tonight -- grandparents who have to raise their grandchildren. 
The kids are growing up healthy, but this second round of parenthood 
is taking a toll on the grandparents. NBC's fredricka Whitfield on 
the risks. After 32 years of work -- What's that word? Jan Richmond 
of California looked forward to retiring from the school board next 
year. This ought to be 80 -- looks like a distinct possibility for 
retirement, if i'm lucky. Do you need to get dressed? In Atlanta, 
former nurse addie Dale reflects on what retirement used to be like. 
Oh, you're dressed. I used to get up and, could sleep a little later, 
would get up and kind of have a leisure breakfast and a leisure Bible 
study. Two grandparents complete strangers making the same discovery 
as more than 4 million other older Americans across the country. We 
thank the lord for waking us up this morning. Raising grandchildren 
can put your health in danger, even lead to chronic illnesses. In 
fact, a recent Georgia state University study of 100 women raising 
their grandchildren found that 75% were overweight, 50% had high blood 
pressure. Experts say it's because so many grandparents already experiencing 
some health problems and living on fixed incomes. oh, my. no. no. 
Put this back. Often put their own needs on the backburner. By the 
time they care for the children, get them to school and all their 
regular activities, they just often don't have the resources or the 
time left to make appointments, to go seek health care. Since 1970, 
the number of house holds headed by grandparents has increased 76%. 
And nearly half of the grandparents are women. Raising kids all alone. 
In most cases, filling in for parents who either can't or won't be 
there for the children. At healthy grandparents meetings in Atlanta, 
there's help. 130 over 85. Very good. Here, grandparents get free 
medical screening and on this day, a Lesson on hypertension. There 
aren't enough support groups yet to go around. But experts say there 
are at least three key ingredients for good health. It's following 
the medical regime, it's getting exercise, and following a Proper 
diet. So that they can be there for their grandchildren, without jeopardizing 
their golden years. Fredricka Whitfield, NBC news, Atlanta.
