for the world, i'm liz George in New York. You're listening to THE 
WORLD, but you can join us anytime online 24 hours a day at www.theworld.org. 
This is PRI. Holiday shopping is upon us but don't let it stress you. 
I'm Ellen Kushner. On this week's "Sound and Spirit," we'll be hearing 
a host of new CD releases, seeking out the sound that perfectly fits 
the spirit of everyone on your list. We'll also hear letters about 
past programs and take a look forward into the new year. It's "Sound 
and Spirits" gift-giving edition from PRI, Public Radio International. 
Saturday night at on 91 FM, WHYY. I'm Tony Kahn. Ahead on THE WORLD, 
the case of convicted American spy Jonathan Pollard is for his wife 
about more than one man. If anything, Jonathan is the Litmus test 
of the true nature of the relationship between Israel and the United 
States. Also ahead, Bob Brozman hears the blues wherever he goes. 
First, this news.
