Some people wonder whether there are too many new saints under consideration 
these days. There are also hundreds of saints most of us don't know 
about, like St. Rosalie of Palermo, the protector against plague, 
smallpox, typhoid and earthquakes; the Holy Child of Atocha, the patron 
of travelers who risk capture by non-Christian enemies, and St. Isidore 
the Plowman, the patron of rain and good crops. Stanley Marcus' collection 
of carved images of these saints and others, made in the 1800s by 
Hispanic colonists, native New Mexicans and American Indians in the 
Southwest, are coming up for auction at Sotheby's next week, and they 
give new meaning to the term ``folk art.'' The sale, on Dec. 2, consists 
of 159 items from the Marcus collection of Southwestern art, and is 
part of Sotheby's sale of ``Important American Indian Art.'' Marcus 
and his wife, Linda, bought the works _ American Indian, New Mexican 
Devotional and Latin American _ for their home in Santa Fe, N.M. They 
are now selling the house and the collection because Marcus, 93, is 
finding it difficult to live at the high altitude. In a recent interview, 
Marcus said he started buying bultos, three-dimensional carvings of 
saints, on his first trip to New Mexico in 1937, a decade after Mable 
Dodge Lujan, a socially prominent Easterner, established an art colony 
in Taos, N.M. But there was little interest in such art in this country 
then. ``At the time, bultos were $40 to $60 apiece,'' he said. And 
while he traveled the world buying the most sophisticated, high-style 
couture for Neiman-Marcus, his father's department store, he was also 
developing a taste for native folk art. He spoke of how bultos came 
to be carved in New Mexico: founded in 1598, New Mexico was a frontier 
ruled by Spain until 1821. ``After the Christian conquistadors conquered 
New Mexico, they brought in a carver with models,'' Marcus said. ``The 
Indians saw them and then carved their own religious sculptures.'' 
The sculptures were not just for decoration. ``They were devotional 
objects,'' Marcus said. ``They were daily companions to the farmers 
and ranchers. They helped them through their lives.'' The easiest 
way to understand the importance of the works is to read Harriet Doerr's 
beautifully written novella ``Stones for Ibarra,'' which recounts 
a young American woman's life in rural Mexico and her confrontation 
with the faith of the local people. An essay in the catalog for the 
Al Luckett Jr. sale at Sotheby's in January by Larry Frank, the author 
of ``New Kingdom of the Saints: Religious Art of New Mexico, 1780-1907,'' 
also explores the role of bultos. Frank wrote that the saints were 
``not worshiped by Catholics like Jesus and Mary but rather they are 
revered and esteemed.'' ``Like miscreant children they can be naughty 
and whimsical because they do not always behave properly,'' he continued. 
``They simply do not grant everyone's petition.'' But Frank said, 
``As members of an extended family, they are accepted as companions, 
supporters and benefactors along with their foibles and consequently 
they are loved.'' It's a bit like the antics of Zeus and the Olympian 
gods. For Marcus, the bultos carry a special appeal. ``There's a sincerity 
to them that is moving,'' he said. ``They are more naive than the 
bultos of any other culture in Latin America.'' Marcus has studied 
his collection with the help of dealers. Some of the bultos in it 
are quite primitive and others more refined. ``Most of the early carvers 
have now been identified,'' he said. One of the more primitive bultos 
for sale is carved polychromed wood thought to be a representation 
of St. Raymond of the Unborn, the patron of pregnant women and women 
in childbirth. This saint, in long robe and red cloak, has clenched 
fists that may have once held implements. The sale catalog says that 
women giving birth would pray a novena to St. Raymond for nine days 
before the delivery. With his deep-set eyes and well-trimmed beard, 
he is a kindly saint. Experts speculate that the artist was Pedro 
Antonio Fresquis or Jose Aragon, circa 1820. The estimate is $2,500 
to $3,500. Another Aragon, Rafael Aragon, is thought to be the carver 
of St. Michael the Archangel, circa 1820. The angel has speckled, 
flaring yellow wings, a sword in his hand and a serpent at his feet. 
His task was to fight the devil. He was also the patron of soldiers 
and the guardian of small children. The estimate is $5,000 to $7,000. 
A third bulto for sale is of St. Isidore the Plowman, driving a pair 
of oxen with the help of a small angel. He is attributed to Jose Benito 
Ortega, a prolific carver who worked between 1875 and 1907. St. Isidore 
is the patron of farmers and crops, and was petitioned for rain. ``Farmers 
depended on his good will,'' Marcus said. ``He could assure them continuity 
and reproduction for their livestock and themselves. Survival was 
their biggest worry.'' The estimate is $20,000 to $30,000. Probably 
the most refined bulto in the sale is Our Lady of St. John of the 
Lakes. She is mounted on a wood platform and flanked by two wood candles. 
Her face is modeled to emphasize her dark eyes. Her robe and crown 
are painted red, her cloak blue. Her hands are cupped in prayer. The 
work is attributed to Antonio Molleno or the Laguna School, circa 
1800-45. The estimate is $18,000 to $22,000. The Museum of International 
Folk Art in Santa Fe also has examples of Laguna School bultos. Its 
catalog ``Traditional Arts of Spanish New Mexico'' is another good 
introduction to these carvings. The Marcuses were married in 1979. 
At the time, Mrs. Marcus, an anthropologist who had worked in Belize, 
Panama and Nicaragua, collected Mexican and Guatamalen textiles. After 
they bought a second home in Santa Fe, Marcus was soon hooked on textiles, 
too, and they began to buy blankets and rugs. He realized, he said, 
that ``textiles embody all the dimensions of art: color, innovation, 
talent.'' Marcus' favorite textile in the sale is a manta, a classic 
Navajo woman's shawl from the 1870s made of hand-spun wool, that once 
hung in his master bedroom. Its stripes of rare indigo blue alternate 
with bands of red and pale blue. The estimate is $35,000 to $45,000. 
The Marcuses bring different backgrounds to their collecting. Jay 
Cantor, a Sotheby's freelance consultant, wrote in the catalog: ``For 
Stanley, in the end, it is the conjunction of both the humanity of 
the object and the perfection of the form that combines to create 
an excited and ongoing energy, and for Linda, it is also the especially 
fine state of preservation.'' In addition to the bultos and textiles, 
the sale includes prehistoric Southwestern pottery, contemporary Acoma 
black-on-white jars, antique carved storage chests and vintage Indian 
clothing. ``We bought what we liked, not what we should have bought,'' 
Marcus said. ``If we had concentrated on one thing, we would have 
a great collection, but we wouldn't have had as much fun.''
