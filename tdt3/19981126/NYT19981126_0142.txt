Speaking as the first British prime minister ever to address the Parliament 
of the Irish Republic, Tony Blair on Thursday declared an end to centuries 
of British-Irish hostility and said that London and Dublin must now 
work together to rescue the stalled Northern Ireland peace effort. 
Blair, addressing a joint session of the Senate and the lower house, 
used the occasion not to advance any prescription for the peace effort 
but to nurture good will between two nations who have been enemies 
for 800 years. He emphasized his own Irish roots, waxed nostalgic 
about childhood memories of Ireland and tried his tongue at Gaelic, 
bringing smiles to many of the 226 Irish lawmakers in attendance. 
He also appealed to common history rather than to a history of division, 
and received one of several ovations when he said: ``So much shared 
history, so much shared pain. And now the shared hope of a new beginning.'' 
The event was another in a string of efforts by Ireland and Britain 
to move closer and was broadcast live by Irish national television. 
``It is a cementing of the close friendly relationship between the 
two governments,'' said Brian Farrell, Irish television's senior commentator. 
Other recent steps include a visit by the Irish president, Mary MacAleese, 
to Queen Elizabeth II in London, and a visit by Prince Philip to Dublin 
two weeks ago. The queen is widely expected to become the first British 
monarch to visit Ireland since it won independence after a bloody 
insurrection in the early 1920s. Blair urged a solution to the problems 
blocking the enactment of the provisions of the Northern Ireland peace 
agreement approved in the spring. He said the peace effort is ``at 
a difficult juncture.'' He alluded to the basic obstacle, the dispute 
over disarmament of the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republican 
Army in the predominantly Protestant British province of Ulster. ``Let 
us not underestimate how far we have come; and let us agree that we 
have come too far to go back now,'' Blair said. Seeming to speak directly 
to the IRA, which has refused to disarm, he added that it was ``time 
for the gun and the threat of the gun to be taken out of politics 
once and for all; for decommissioning to start.'' Decommissioning 
is Ulsterspeak for disarmament. ``I am not asking anyone to surrender,'' 
he said. ``I am asking everyone to declare the victory of peace.'' 
The IRA and its political wing, Sinn Fein, insist, accurately, that 
the peace agreement specifies only that disarmament will take place 
by the spring of 2000. But leaders of Northern Ireland's Protestant 
majority insist that some disarmament must start soon, before Sinn 
Fein is allowed to participate fully in new governmental power-sharing 
structures that will give Catholics more political power in the North. 
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sat unsmiling in the visitors' 
gallery in the parliament chamber in Leinster House. He is an elected 
member of the British Parliament in London, but refuses to take his 
seat because that would involve an oath of loyalty to the monarchy. 
Officially, Blair heads what is called Her Majesty's government. Adams' 
claim that Sinn Fein is independent of the IRA is a politically necessary 
fiction, in the view of the vast majority of the people of the Irish 
republic and of Northern Ireland. He says the IRA's 16-month cease-fire 
is convincing evidence that they want peace. ``I reflect on the sheer 
waste of children taught to hate,'' Blair said, ``when I believe passionately 
children should be taught to think. No one should ignore the injustices 
of the past, or the lessons of history. But too often between us, 
one person's history has been another person's myth.'' ``The old ways 
are changing between London and Dublin,'' he continued. ``And this 
can spur the change and healing in Northern Ireland too. The old notions 
of Unionists' supremacy and of narrow nationalism are gradually having 
their fingers prised from their grip on the future.'' Ireland and 
Britain became enemies 800 years ago, when an Irish warlord invited 
an English warrior, Strongbow, to help him kill other Irish armies. 
In the 17th century Oliver Cromwell led a bloody punitive expedition 
to Ireland. Eamon de Valera, one of the founders of independent Ireland, 
outraged Prime Minister Winston Churchill by keeping the country neutral 
during World War II. In 1972, Catholic nationalists burned the British 
embassy in Dublin. In 1979, the IRA killed the queen's cousin, Lord 
Mountbatten. But in the late 1980s and early 1990s an Englishman, 
Jack Charlton, became the most popular man in Ireland as he made the 
national soccer team a world-class contender. And in 1997, Irishmen 
and women placed thousands of bouquets outside the British embassy 
after the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales. Only a small minority 
of the Irish lawmakers can speak Gaelic, one of the two official national 
languages, but most knew enough to applaud Blair's attempt when he 
said, ``Go raibh mile mait agaibh,'' roughly, ``thank you from the 
bottom of my heart.'' They also enjoyed the prime minister's statement: 
``Ireland, as you may know, is in my blood.'' His mother was born 
in County Donegal ``above her grandmother's hardware shop,'' he said. 
``She lived there as a child, started school there and only moved 
when her father died, her mother remarried and they crossed the water 
to Glasgow.'' He said that in his childhood his family spent summer 
holidays in Ireland. ``We would travel the beautiful countryside of 
Donegal. It was there in the seas off the Irish coast that I first 
learned to swim, there that my father took me to my first pub, a remote 
little house in the country, for a Guinness, a taste I've never forgotten 
and which is always a pleasure to repeat,'' Blair said.
