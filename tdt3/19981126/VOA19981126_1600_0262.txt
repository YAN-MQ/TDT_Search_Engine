The US oil companies Exxon and Mobile are discussing a merger to create 
what would be the world's premier energy business. Sources close to 
the talk say, a final transaction could be reached as early as next 
week. A deal would be the largest industrial merger ever. Oil analyst 
Fergus McCloyd says the merger should be positive for consumers. It 
means that the organizations that provide you with gasoline at service 
stations should have lower costs. And they should be able to pass 
on some of the benefits of lower costs in retail prices that are lower 
than they would otherwise be. The companies have not confirmed reports 
of the talks. Exxon is the world's largest energy company, while Mobil 
is the second largest US oil company.
