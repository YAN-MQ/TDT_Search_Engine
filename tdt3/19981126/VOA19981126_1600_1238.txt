Meanwhile American League batting champion, Bernie Williams has resigned 
-- that is re-signed -- with the World Series Champion New York Yankees. 
The 30-year-old center fielder inked a 7-year deal Wednesday night. 
Yankees' General Manager Brian Cashman explains the contract. The 
original offer we made was accurately given in the press and the media, 
which was 60 for five. And ultimately, we signed them to a seven year 
deal with the club option for the eighth, that the total guaranteed 
money was 87/five. The contract also contains an option for 2006 and 
is expected to keep Williams in Yankee pinstripes for the rest of 
his career. Williams said he had given other free agent offers a lot 
of thought, but in the end his decision came down to the fact that 
he wanted to remain a New York Yankee.
