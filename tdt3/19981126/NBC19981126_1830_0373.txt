Still ahead on this Thanksgiving day -- eating your way to a healthier 
life. These are foods that can actually Ward off the kinds of diseases 
and ailments that we all develop as we grow older. Designer foods 
-- state-of-the-art nutrition from some of the most common foods we 
eat. And why help for the desperate people of Iraq is not reaching 
them. Is Saddam Hussein to blame? You got heartburn, too? Yeah. Wanna 
try these new pepcid ac chewables? It says you gotta take it with 
water. What's the water for? With tums, you don't need water. Just 
because new pepcid is chewable doesn't mean it works like tums. Tums 
calcium knocks out heartburn fast. Pepcid chewables' famotidine has 
to go through your bloodstream, so it takes 40 minutes just to start 
working. You wanna go back for water? Forget the water. Pass the tums. 
Tums ta tum tum tums I never get up early to powerwalk or power jog. 
But I'll be at the JCPenney after Thanksgiving sale at seven A.M. 
Friday. Where I'll save fifty percent on select stuff storewide while 
quantities last. With power shopping I know I'll see results. Mornings 
seem so much brighter after a good night's sleep. That's why I love 
my Tylenol pm. It stops my pain and helps me sleep so in the morning 
I'm rested, refreshed... ready to make the most of my day. It's... 
the truck. The award. The new Chevy Silverado. The motor trend truck 
of the year. It's bigger. It's more powerful. It's the truck. From 
Chevrolet. Like a rock. oh...like a rock.
