A leading Russian bank has offered a dlrs 100,000 reward for information 
that could help solve the killing of a prominent liberal lawmaker, 
the bank president said in an interview published Thursday. Galina 
Starovoitova, 52, was gunned down by unidentified assailants on the 
stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg last week, and 
was buried Tuesday in a ceremony attended by thousands of mourners. 
``If this crime goes unpunished, it would deal an enormous blow to 
peoples' attitude to the state,'' Mikhail Friedman, the head of the 
Alpha-Bank, said in an interview published in the business daily Kommersant. 
``It would leave no hope that the government is capable of caring 
for ordinary citizens, since it's unable to care for even the leading 
members of the society.'' Friedman said his bank would pay dlrs 100,000 
from its charity fund to any person or group that provides information 
to help solve the crime. ``When we learned about this gruesome murder, 
we consulted our partners and colleagues and decided that we must 
take part despite the current difficult financial situation,'' Friedman 
said. Starovoitova's slaying had all the trademarks of a contract 
murder, which have become common in Russia and are rarely solved. 
Still, her death has provoked outrage among many Russians. Many of 
the killings are related to business disputes, but Starovoitova had 
no known business interests and was perhaps the most prominent female 
political figure in the country. Police have not announced any major 
breakthroughs in the case. However, the Russian media has speculated 
that the killing was linked to Starovoitova's role in local elections 
in St. Petersburg set for Dec. 6. A number of reports have claimed 
that local mobsters might have been tempted to kill Starovoitova because 
her liberal election bloc, the Northern Capital, is expected to make 
a strong showing. Starovoitova was not on the ballot, but was campaigning 
for her allies, who have often spoken out against corruption. Russian 
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said Thursday that detectives had 
received some clues from Starovoitova's aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov. 
He suffered serious head wounds but has recovered enough to speak 
with police. His testimony along with other witness accounts should 
allow police to make sketches of the attackers, Stepashin said.
