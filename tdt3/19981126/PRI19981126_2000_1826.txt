For THE WORLD, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC newsroom in London. 
The Chilean government is sending a mission to Europe to try to win 
freedom for the country's former military leader, General Augusto 
Pinochet. The general cannot leave Britain because the country's highest 
court ruled that he's not immune from prosecution. He is currently 
in a clinic in London and faces possible extradition to Spain for 
alleged genocide and torture.
