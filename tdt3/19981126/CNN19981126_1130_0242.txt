The White House says it will now be at least tomorrow before it delivers 
answers to 81 questions from the house Judiciary committee. A spokeswoman 
says Mr. Clinton and his lawyers are still working on responses, which 
she says should be finished and signed tomorrow. The questions from 
committee chairman Henry Hyde are based on independent counsel Ken 
Starr's report to Congress on the Monica Lewinsky matter. Hyde is 
threatening to subpoena the president if he does not voluntarily submit 
his answers by Monday.
