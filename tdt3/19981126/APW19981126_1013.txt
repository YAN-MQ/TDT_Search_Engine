Spain's Constitutional Court has rejected a bid by a former cabinet 
minister and another ex-official to be released from prison while 
they appeal their convictions in a `dirty war' against Basque separatists, 
news reports said Thursday. The court ruled that former Socialist 
government minister Jose Barrionuevo, his former top aide, Rafael 
Vera, and four others convicted in the case should remain in jail 
while the appeals are heard. Another four who were convicted _ former 
low-ranking police officials _ will be allowed to leave jail, the 
private Europa Press news agency and other media reported. Barrionuevo, 
Interior Minister under former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez between 
1982-86, and 11 others were convicted in July of organizing the 1983 
kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was mistaken for a hitman of 
the armed Basque separatist group ETA and held for 10 days. The abduction 
was the first act attributed to the self-styled Anti-Terrorist Liberation 
Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill 27 people over the next 
four years in a campaign designed to crush ETA. Many of the victims 
were mistaken targets. The case against Barrionuevo came after two 
police officers also convicted in the case alleged that the GAL was 
run by Gonzalez's government. Gonzalez, who has always denied his 
government had anything to do with the dirty war, is acting as a lawyer 
in Barrionuevo's appeal. ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old 
drive for an independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain. 
It is currently abiding by an unconditional ceasefire begun Sept. 
18. Barrionuevo, 56, and ex-secretary of state for security Vera, 
53, began serving 10-year sentences on Sept. 10. Last month the Supreme 
Court also rejected the two men's petition to be released while their 
appeals are studied.
