British prime minister Tony Blair is predicting the northern Ireland 
peace accord will ultimately work. He made those comments during a 
speech in Dublin today, the first speech by a British prime minister 
to an Irish parliament in 76 years. Blair said the British and the 
Irish are "irredeemably linked." He urged everyone involved in the 
peace process to live up to their commitments and to declare what 
he called "the victory of peace."
