Former skiing star Alberto Tomba and his father were indicted Thursday 
on charges of tax fraud, and the court set a trial date in March 2000. 
Tomba's mother was cleared. None of the defendants was present in 
the Bologna courthouse. The three-time Olympic champion, who announced 
his retirement from the slopes last month, is accused of failing to 
pay taxes on 23 billion lire (dlrs 14 million) in income from 1990-96. 
Franco Tomba is his son's business manager. Tax fraud is punishable 
in Italy by up to five years in prison and fines.
