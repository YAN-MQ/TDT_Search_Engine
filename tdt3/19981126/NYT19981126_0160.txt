In the last year, exposure to Asia has generally meant risking a bad 
case of the flu. The region's economic turmoil has weakened demand, 
and the health of many companies _ and their stocks _ has suffered. 
But some analysts see signs of a possible Asian recovery. Economists 
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, for example, forecast growth in gross 
domestic product for the region, excluding Japan, of 3.3 percent for 
1999. Falling interest rates, looser monetary policies, rebounding 
currencies and greater direct foreign investment are also positive 
signs. In a recent report, the Morgan Stanley analysts Markus Rosgen 
in Hong Kong and Deborah Weinswig in New York said that it was too 
soon to declare the Asian crisis over, but that there were ``glimmers 
of hope'' in the region. They recommended that investors consider 
multinational corporations they might have avoided previously because 
of Asian exposure. Working with their colleagues, the analysts compiled 
a list of North American companies that derive at least a fourth of 
their revenues from Asia. While investors who remain skeptical can 
still avoid these companies, buying stocks of multinationals helps 
reduce the risk of betting on the Asian turnaround. ``These are globally 
diversified companies,'' Ms. Weinswig said, and that diversification 
should help protect them even if the Asian economy fails to recover. 
Technology companies, especially semiconductor-related companies like 
Kulicke &AMP; Soffa Industries, Applied Materials and Intel, are among 
the biggest sellers to Asia, according to the analysts, but demand 
for their goods is not driven solely by Asian companies or consumers. 
While these companies initially ship many of their goods to the region, 
they are then assembled into electronic products that are exported 
to other areas. Energy companies like Unocal, Texaco, Chevron and 
Mobil also do a lot of business in Asia. Morgan Stanley has also uncovered 
some companies whose exposure to Asia may be less obvious: Aflac, 
an insurer, which gets the bulk of its sales from Japan, and AMF Bowling, 
which runs bowling centers. Investors may also want to consider overseas 
companies that aren't based in Asia but that derive a sizable share 
of their revenue there. These include Cable and Wireless Communications 
of Britain, the telecommunications company; Gucci Group of the Netherlands, 
a luxury goods maker; Bulgari of Italy, a jeweler, and Sappi of South 
Africa, a paper maker.
