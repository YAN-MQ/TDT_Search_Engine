Military prosecutors said Thursday they have asked for an arrest warrant 
for communist-era prosecutor Helena Wolinska, a step toward seeking 
her extradition from England. Historians say Wolinska, 79, is responsible 
for the 1952 arrest and subsequent execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf, 
a World War II resistance hero, on allegedly fabricated evidence. 
She failed to appear in Poland on Oct. 15 to testify at the investigation 
of Fieldorf's death. Col. Tadeusz Krysicki, head of the Warsaw Military 
Prosecutor's Office, said it was seeking a temporary arrest warrant 
for Wolinska, which he called a requirement for any further steps 
toward her extradition. Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the 
Polish underground Home Army that fought the Nazis during World War 
II. After the war, he refused to collaborate with the secret service 
of the new communist regime. He was charged by Wolinska in 1952 with 
killing Soviet soldiers and leftist resisters during the war, and 
was hanged in 1953. Historians say Wolinska fabricated the charges. 
If formally charged and convicted of denying Fieldorf his freedom, 
Wolinska could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. Wolinska 
lives in Oxford and is a British citizen. According to Polish media 
reports, Britain could refuse to extradite her even though it has 
an extradition treaty with Poland. Maria Gorowska, the judge who presided 
over Fieldorf's trial, died of cancer in January without testifying 
in the investigation. Also Thursday, a state commission investigating 
Nazi and communist crimes in Poland said it found evidence of 2,450 
death sentences carried out by the communists from 1944-56. Witold 
Kulesza, head of the Commission for Investigating Crimes on the Polish 
Nation, said some of the sentences were for stealing food from state-owned 
farms or selling hard currency, which was illegal then. Kulesza said 
the committee will seek homicide charges against any prosecutors and 
judges involved in the verdicts who are still living.
