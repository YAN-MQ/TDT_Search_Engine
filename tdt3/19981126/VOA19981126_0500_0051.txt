I'm Becky Bailey, VOA News. A train accident in India's Northern Punjab 
State has killed at least 100 people. More than 250 others are injured 
and many are in critical condition. VOA New Delhi Correspondent, Douglas 
Bachun has the story. Two passenger trains were involved in the accident 
near Kana, in the darkness of early morning Thursday. A railway spokesman 
says the Golden Temple Express heading for Atmosphere derailed and 
shortly afterwards, the Calcutta bound Sielda Express collided with 
the derailed cars. Police say the engine and several cars of one of 
the trains crumbled on impact. Rescue workers cut through the wreckage 
with blow torches to remove the bodies and survivors. Hundred of local 
villagers helped police with rescue efforts. And shops and schools 
in Kana closed to mourn the dead. Traffic along northern train routes 
in Punjab were suspended to allow workers to clear the crash site. 
Railway officials have ordered an investigation into the accident.
