The house Judiciary committee will take the day off for Thanksgiving, 
then it's back to work on Friday. Wolf Blitzer has the latest developments 
on the impeachment hearing. As the president and his family left for 
a long Thanksgiving weekend at camp David, his aides were insisting 
he's still reviewing answers to the 81 questions the house Judiciary 
committee sent him three weeks ago. They say the answers will be released 
Friday. They insist he will continue to deny he committed perjury 
during his january 17th deposition in the Paula Jones case, or during 
his August 17th testimony before the Monica Lewinsky grand jury. They 
insist there won't be any bombshells. Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde, 
frustrated by the delay, sent a letter to the president, warning he'll 
subpoena those answers unless they arrive by monday. "The committee 
is reaching the critical stage of this process," Hyde writes. White 
House officials insist they'll meet that deadline. They say they're 
also considering Hyde's proposal that the president's legal advisers 
make their case against impeachment before the committee on december 
8th. In his answers, aides say the president will walk a legal tightrope 
by sticking to his earlier testimony, as well as to the formal White 
House responses issued immediately after Ken Starr's allegations were 
sent to congress in September. Among the questions the committee wants 
the president to answer -- Those kinds of questions are questions 
that if you are certainly representing the president in a criminal 
context you don't want him to answer. But we're talking about impeachment 
process, where most of the rules simply don't exist. Meanwhile, house 
democrats have written to Starr asking that he answer 19 questions 
about the way he conducted his investigation -- a Follow-up to his 
testimony last week. Wolf Blitzer, CNN, the White House.
