Chilean President Eduardo Fray sending his Foreign Minister to London 
in an effort to prevent the extradition of Former Chilean Dictator, 
Augusto Pinochet to Spain. Mr. Fray told the nation Wednesday that 
the British Court's decision to deny the 83 year old General immunity 
from prosecution is not the end of the battle. Foreign Minister Jose 
Megal Isolsa is trying to persuade the British government not to act 
on a Spanish extradition request, accusing General Pinochet of torture 
and genocide when he was Chile's head of state.
