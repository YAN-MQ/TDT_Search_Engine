And that music brings us time now for Sports, with Dave Byrd. All 
right, thanks a lot Tony. American tennis star Pete Sampras has made 
history thanks to a little help from the man who tried to take the 
World's number one ranking from him. As John Meyers reports, Sampras 
keeps the world number one spot, because Marcello Rios pulled out 
of the season-ending ATP championships in Germany. Day three produced 
some more thrilling tennis, and another short withdrawal as Pete Sampras 
was crowned World Number One for a recording-breaking sixth consecutive 
year, following the decision by number two, Marcello Rios to pull 
out minutes before his clash with Greg Rosetsky. The British Number 
Two standing in for Andre Aggassi had no problems in beating second 
reserve Albert Costa in straight sets whilst earlier his fellow countryman 
Tim Handman booked a semifinal place with the two sets two one big 
over Alex Carrachia. A full house of around 14,000 people enjoyed 
the final match of the day, which turned into an exhibition as Pete 
Sampras celebrated retaining the top spot with a 6-2, 6-1 crushing 
of Slovak Karal Cacharra. John Meyers for VOA Sports, in Hanover, 
Germany.
