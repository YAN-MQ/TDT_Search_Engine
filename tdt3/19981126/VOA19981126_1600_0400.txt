Argentina and Uruguay have expressed solidarity with Chile's efforts 
to block the extradition of General Pinochet from Britain for trial 
in Spain. Details from George Meek in our South America Bureau. Uruguay's 
foreign ministry has issued a formal communique supporting Chile. 
Uruguay says that regardless of the persons involved, it rejects any 
attempt by a country to assert jurisdiction over crimes committed 
in another country. Uruguayan President. Julio Maria Sanguinettie 
reaffirmed the principal in a television interview. He said if Spain 
can charge General Pinochet, it would open the door for some US judge 
to try to extradite former Uruguayan Guerrillas who killed an American 
diplomat in Montevideo, three decades ago. Argentine Interior Minister, 
Carlos Corrage says the decision of the British House of Lords, denying 
General Pinochet's immunity is a serious mistake that does not respect 
international criminal law. Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Detalla 
and Colombian President, Andres Pastriana both says the case shows 
the need for an international tribunal to try crimes of genocide. 
Peruvian foreign minister Fernando DeTrajiania says that if the concept 
of national jurisdiction is undermined, there is no telling what might 
happen in the future. Human rights groups in South America welcomed 
the decision of the House of Lords. But Quito-based Latin American 
Human Rights Association calls it a victory for a form of law that 
puts protection of human rights above any question of diplomatic immunity, 
or third nation jurisdiction. Bolivia's Congress unanimously approved 
a resolution Thursday, calling for the Spanish judge in charge of 
the Pinochet case to investigate the detention, torture and murder 
of Bolivians in Chile during the military dictatorship. George Meek,
