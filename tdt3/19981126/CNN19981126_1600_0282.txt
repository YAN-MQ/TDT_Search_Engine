Independent counsel Ken Starr has some questions to answer courtesy 
of house Judiciary committee democrats. Yesterday, the democrats sent 
Starr a letter that contains 19 questions they said are follow-UPS 
to his testimony last week. They want to know things like when Starr 
first became aware his ethics adviser planned to resign because of 
the independent counsel's decision to testify in the impeachment inquiry. 
The letter also asked Starr to provide a list of clients he has represented 
as a private lawyer since becoming independent counsel. Last night 
on ABC's "20/20," Starr defended his investigation. It wasn't just 
my professional judgment, but it was the professional judgment of 
the senior leadership of the department of justice, including the 
attorney general of the U.S., that this had to be looked into. What 
the Supreme Court has said emphatically, it said it repeatedly, you 
cannot perjure yourself. There is no excuse for perjury. Never, never, 
never.
