Stock markets are closed today for the Thanksgiving holiday. Yesterday, 
there was a lot of profit taking on Wall Street as investors prepared 
for the break. One curious side effect was a dip in the value of Brazil's 
currency, as U.S. investors preferred to sell Brazilian stocks rather 
than risk holding them for an extra day. As Liz George explains from 
our business desk in New York, this comes as the Brazilian government 
is trying to convince the world community that it's on the way to 
financial recovery. This week sees the end of a series of road shows 
in Europe during which the Brazilian finance minister, Pedro Milan, 
called for banks and financial institutions to begin investing in 
Brazil once again. Following the IMF's $41.5 billion credit line package 
for the country, he says he's confident the economy's beginning to 
return to a steady footing. There has been an enormous improvement 
both in the matter of the political debate in Brazil and the rationality 
of the economics discourse in Brazil, and a clear understanding that 
we must preserve the stability of the purchasing power of the domestic 
currency, which is the stability of the purchasing power of the wages 
of the Brazilian worker, and the respect for hard budget constraint. 
I think this is there already, and it's very important change. And 
Minister Pedro Milan emphasized that now is the time to invest. Well, 
it's the same message of confidence in Brazil and its future, something 
which is not difficult, because especially when I talk to those banks 
and financial institutions who have been - many of them are there, 
have been there, some of them for decade either directly working through 
enterprises and financial institutions in Brazil. They know the country 
reasonably well, and they know the potentialities there. So the feedback 
I'm receiving, I would say, is a positive one, and I'm sure this thing 
will be refracted in the statistics as we move forward. Over the next 
year, the Brazilian economy is not expected to grow much. The predictions 
for a rate of.6 percent compared to 3 percent last year as a result 
of the stringent financial reforms being imposed by the government. 
Meanwhile, the Brazilian currency, the real, took a bit of a tumble 
this week, ahead of today's Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. traders were 
selling their Brazilian assets choosing instead to park their profits 
in U.S. dollars while they took a break to eat turkey.
