Researchers in Colorado say there is new evidence people are to blame 
for global warming. They say by studying 115 years of global temperature 
data, they found the release of Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide 
explains most of the reason for the phenomenon. Some people thought 
natural occurrences, like sunspots or volcanoes, were responsible. 
The findings are published in the journal "science."
