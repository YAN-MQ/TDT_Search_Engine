Turkish authorities say Kurdish rebels have sabotaged a pipeline carrying 
crude oil from Iraq through Turkey. They said the rebels set the pipeline 
on fire late Wednesday in Mardine Province. Fire crews extinguished 
the blaze several hours later. Turkish officials are examining the 
extent of the damage. One official said the fire burned an estimated 
50 tons of crude oil.
