The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued new warnings about 
the wildly popular anti-impotence drug, Viagra. The FDA cautions that 
it may be too risky to give Viagra to men who recently had heart attacks 
or who has very high blood pressure. The agency is requiring Viagra's 
maker to add the more explicit warnings to the drugs label. The FDA 
says it still says Viagra is safe and that serious problems have arisen 
in only a fraction of the six million subscriptions written for Viagra 
since April. About 130 men have died after taking Viagra but it is 
not clear that the drug caused the deaths. You're listening to VOA 
News Now.
