The head of the International Monetary Fund says the worst of the 
global financial crisis is over. But, Michele Kondosus says some obstacles 
still impede recovery. Although, he believes it is possible to avoid 
a global recession. Speaking to Spanish business leaders in Madrid, 
Mr. Kondosus contradicted critics who believe the Brazilian and lied 
American markets are doomed. He praised Brazil's three year economic 
and financial reform program but Mr. Kondosus was more pessimistic 
about the financial states of Japan and Russia which he said should 
formulate a plan to stabilize their economies.
