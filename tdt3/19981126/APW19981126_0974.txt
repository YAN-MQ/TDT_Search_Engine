An armed man opened fire in a bar east of Paris Thursday afternoon, 
killing two people and critically injuring another, police said. The 
gunman entered the ``Le Paris'' bar in Lilas, a working class suburb 
east of Paris, just before 3 p.m. (1400 GMT) and shot the bar's owner, 
the owner's wife and a waiter, police said. The attacker fled the 
scene in a car. The bar's owner, Gerard Pasquier, 51, and the waiter, 
Marc Braun, 54, died of their injuries, despite efforts by emergency 
workers to resuscitate them. Christine Pasquier, 53, was taken to 
the hospital but her life was not in danger, emergency workers said. 
Investigators do not know the motive for the shooting, but said they 
believe it could be a settling of scores. Two customers who witnessed 
the shooting were being treated for shock, police said.
