Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan apologized Thursday to President 
Jiang Zemin of China for Japan's conduct in World War II, but the 
two countries immediately became entangled in an uproar about the 
wartime memories that still haunt relations between the two great 
powers of East Asia. Jiang is the first Chinese head of state to visit 
Japan, and the five-day trip was intended as a milestone in the process 
of healing suspicions between the countries. Instead, the session 
on Thursday seemed to inflame the antagonisms. Instead of focusing 
on the Asian economic crisis or the risks of war on the Korean Peninsula, 
the summit meeting has been caught up in disputes about events of 
half a century ago. Once again the main force shaping East Asia's 
future has turned out to be its past. Officials from both sides played 
down the disagreement, emphasizing that Jiang and Obuchi agreed on 
a wide range of important issues ranging from environmental cooperation 
to youth exchanges. But a joint declaration by the leaders was delayed 
for more than five hours, and in an unusual move it was simply issued 
without being signed. Jiang wanted two concessions from Obuchi: a 
clear-cut written apology to the Chinese people for World War II behavior 
by Japan, similar to the apology Japan gave South Korea last month, 
and a pledge about relations with Taiwan similar to the statement 
President Clinton made to China during his visit earlier this year. 
Japan rebuffed Jiang on both counts, instead offering an oral apology 
for the war. ``For the Japan-China relationship to develop further 
in the future, it is necessary to face up to the past squarely,'' 
Obuchi told Jiang. ``There was an unfortunate relationship between 
Japan and China for a certain period in the past.'' ``The Japanese 
government expresses once again its remorse and apology to China on 
this occasion,'' Obuchi added. Akitaka Saiki, Obuchi's spokesman, 
said that Jiang had nodded and then said that it was a good statement. 
``I guess the Chinese president was happy with what Obuchi told him,'' 
Saiki said. ``That's our view.'' China did not publicly express its 
discontent Thursday night, but it did manage to extract an expression 
of Japanese remorse in the joint declaration. ``Japan feels acute 
responsibility for the grave misfortune and harm to the Chinese people 
during a certain period of aggression toward China, and we express 
deep remorse about this,'' the declaration said. But it did not use 
the word apology, which many Japanese feel is more serious than the 
word for remorse. Negotiations over how Japan would refer to the past 
have been going on with China since the summer, and Beijing has been 
pushing for the kind of apology that Obuchi gave President Kim Dae 
Jung of South Korea during Kim's visit last month. At that time Obuchi 
signed a declaration along with Kim expressing Japan's ``remorseful 
repentance and heartfelt apology'' for having inflicted ``unbearable 
damage and pain on the Korean people.'' Japan refused and dug in its 
heels. Saiki explained Thursday night that Japan believes the historical 
circumstances were different and that an apology like the one made 
to the Korean people was inappropriate for China. He noted that Japan 
had formally annexed the Korean Peninsula, while in the case of China 
it had fought a war there. ``We have never colonized China, although 
we did fight on the continent of China, and that is something we have 
to apologize for,'' Saiki said, adding, ``But we do not have to issue 
an apology in writing for China.'' Saiki said that the essence of 
the apology was the same to both countries, and that it was simply 
a matter of the form's being different. Japan also refused to follow 
Clinton's lead and issue a ``three no's'' statement about Taiwan: 
no support for Taiwan independence, no support for a policy of ``one 
China, one Taiwan,'' and no support for entry by Taiwan into international 
groups for which statehood is required. Obuchi did say that he did 
not support Taiwan independence and that he did regard it as Chinese 
territory.
