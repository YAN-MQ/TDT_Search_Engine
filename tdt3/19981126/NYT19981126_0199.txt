In an early scrimmage in the Knicks' training camp in the mid-'60s, 
the chief scout, Red Holzman, watched one of the rookies he had scouted 
_ the team had followed his enthusiastic advice to draft the player 
high _ and now anticipated that he would be a productive member of 
the team. On the sideline, Scout Holzman noticed a flaw in the player 
that he hadn't noticed before. He had trouble getting through screens 
on his left. During a break in the action, Holzman went onto the court 
to demonstrate to the player how it's done. ``You have to look out 
of the corner of your eye and then fight through the screen,'' Holzman 
told the player. ``I can't look out of the corner of my eye,'' the 
player said. ``You can't?'' Red said, skeptically. ``What's so hard?'' 
``I'm blind in the left eye,'' the player said. Holzman looked around 
to see if anyone was in earshot. No one was. ``C'mere,'' he said, 
and led the player to a corner of the gym. Holzman whispered, ``Don't 
ever tell anyone you can't see, OK?'' ``OK,'' the player said. This 
story is revealed for the first time, since Holzman, even some 30 
years after the incident, and after enough successful draft suggestions 
_ from Willis Reed to Walt Frazier _ and enough successes as the coach 
of the Knicks to win two NBA championships and earn him a place in 
the Basketball Hall of Fame, even after all that, was still a little 
embarrassed about the player, who never played in the league. But 
in a relaxed moment at dinner one night he told the story, with the 
self-effacement and humor that had become as much a part of him as 
was Selma, his wife of over 55 years. This week, the MSG Network has 
been broadcasting a half-hour retrospective on Holzman who, as every 
basketball _ and perhaps sports _ fan knows, died on Nov. 13, at age 
78, losing a battle to leukemia. His death came just four months after 
Selma died. To say that he missed Selma would be a gross understatement. 
Just a week before he died, he attended the wedding of George Kalinsky, 
the longtime official photographer at Madison Square Garden. Holzman 
had not been feeling well, and Kalinsky called to inquire after him. 
``I'm OK,'' Holzman said. ``But I was thinking about the gift I gave 
you and June. I don't know if it was appropriate. Selma would have 
done better.'' What made Holzman a successful coach? The reason as 
I see it, and I covered the team in its glory years and grew in friendship 
with Red after he left coaching in 1982, was that he gave people a 
boost, was sensitive and thoughtful of their feelings, left them with 
their dignity and even when being critical did so with an underpinning 
of humor. But he could be tough. And many years after he had coached 
Phil Jackson, the former Bulls coach called Holzman with condolences 
after the death of Selma. Holzman recalled Jackson's saying, surely 
recalling his days as a player for Holzman, ``Red, if you need someone 
to scream and holler at you, call me any time.'' If a friend hadn't 
called him in a while, he'd phone the friend. ``Where've you been?'' 
he asked. He wouldn't put the guy on the defensive by saying, ``How 
come you haven't called?'' It was more like, you must have been lost 
in the wilds of Borneo and couldn't get to a phone. At dinner one 
night in a restaurant in Madison Square Garden, the waiter and Holzman 
greeted each other. ``Is your soup hot tonight?'' Holzman asked. The 
waiter said, ``Of course, Mr. Holzman, absolutely.'' I wondered about 
that question, never having heard it before. Then I realized what 
the coach had done. The soup wasn't hot the last time he was there, 
he didn't want to embarrass the waiter, but wanted to make sure the 
soup was hot this time. When the soup arrived, it was piping hot. 
Sometimes, though, his humor could be wry. Even on his deathbed. His 
daughter, Gail Holzman Papelian, recalled that when her father was 
admitted to the hospital for the last time two weeks ago, he was put 
into a bed in a room with another man. The other man kept talking 
and talking. Red turned to Gail, with an irritated nod toward the 
man. ``Doesn't miss a detail,'' Holzman said quietly. I once invited 
Holzman to lunch with Jackie Mason. Holzman was a great fan of Mason's. 
Mason, however, has no interest in any sport other than boxing. When 
I introduced the comedian to Holzman, I said: ``Jackie, this is Red 
Holzman. He was the brilliant coach of the Knicks.'' Mason looked 
at Holzman. ``Doesn't look so smart to me,'' he said. Red loved it.
