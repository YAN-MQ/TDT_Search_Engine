The house Judiciary committee reportedly is drawing up articles of 
impeachment against President Clinton. A senior republican on the 
committee tells "the New York Times" the draft is in its very early 
stages. The official says the articles include perjury, obstruction 
of justice and abuse of power allegations. Any such articles must 
be approved by the 21 members of the house Judiciary committee.
