There were cries of horror and general consternation when the New 
York City Ballet announced that George Balanchine would create a ``Nutcracker'' 
for the company. How could that revered avant-gardist pander so to 
public taste? Could the chronically penny-counting company even afford 
to present a ``Nutcracker''? The City Ballet production opened on 
Feb. 2, 1954, at City Center, the company's home before Lincoln Center. 
A Christmastime premiere would, perhaps, have gone a little too far 
in accommodating public taste. Though now a landmark in the company's 
50-year history, ``The Nutcracker'' had a mixed reception, as did 
the 1892 original. John Martin, the dance critic for The New York 
Times, advised audiences to arrive at the theater at ``about 10 o'clock 
when the adults take over.'' This was ``not much of a ballet,'' he 
added, ``a loving and imaginative resurrection of a decidedly mediocre 
work.'' Balanchine's staging did have its early admirers, chief among 
them the dance writer Edwin Denby. `` `The Nutcracker' is a fantasy 
ballet for children, like a toy that a grown-up makes with thoughtful 
care,'' Denby wrote in 1954. ``Grown-ups watching can slip back into 
a world they have left. The buried longings of it are there glittering 
still, but so charmingly, so lightly offered one doesn't have to notice.'' 
A success at the box office, ``The Nutcracker'' was performed for 
a full five weeks the next year; the ballet, in various productions, 
has proved to be a cash cow for American ballet companies ever since. 
And the City Ballet version, which opens Friday night at the New York 
State Theater for a nearly five-week run, has become a rite of passage 
for New York children. ``The Nutcracker'' is a rite of another kind 
for balletomanes, who attend performances regularly to check on each 
new piece of casting. Then there are those who, like Denby, are open 
to the simple magic of the ballet. For Balanchine, the ballet centered 
on the Christmas tree that grows to the top of the stage as the child 
Marie dreams _ or does she dream? _ of bizarre events in the dark 
parlor after the last party guests leave. ``George, can't you do it 
without the tree?'' Morton Baum, then managing director of City Center, 
had asked plaintively. Baum had budgeted $40,000 for the new production; 
the tree cost $25,000. But Balanchine dug in his heels. The ballet, 
he insisted, was the tree. At City Center, Nancy Reynolds recalled 
in her book ``Repertory in Review: 40 Years of the New York City Ballet,'' 
the scenery looked homemade, especially the first Christmas tree, 
``uncurling and wheezing and puffing upward, growing gigantic to some 
of Tchaikovsky's most glorious music.'' In early performances, Lincoln 
Kirstein, a founder of City Ballet, remembered, tiny bulbs wired to 
the tree continually short-circuited, causing alarming special effects. 
Though everything got bigger and slicker when City Ballet moved to 
the larger stage of the New York State Theater in 1964, the tree, 
now zooming awesomely upward, still gets its own round of applause. 
As a ballet student at the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
early this century, Balanchine performed several roles in ``The Nutcracker.'' 
For the City Ballet production, he kept much of the original staging 
by Lev Ivanov. He also moved closer to the story by E.T.A. Hoffmann, 
on which the ballet was based, of a Christmas party in a 19th-century 
middle-class German home and of two children's voyage to a candy kingdom. 
Jerome Robbins choreographed the rowdy first-act battle of invading 
mice. But there are many touches of pure Balanchine. Balanchine's 
love of gadgetry led him to put a galloping bed in the midst of the 
first act and to create an ice-skating glide for the Sugar Plum Fairy 
on a strip moving across the stage. His love of dance ensured choreography 
that made the most of the dancers' gifts in roles from the Sugar Plum 
Fairy and the Dewdrop, danced at the first performance by Maria Tallchief 
and Tanaquil LeClercq, to assorted child candy canes and angels and 
Marie and the Nutcracker Prince, danced originally by Alberta Grant 
and Paul Nickel. Balanchine's production reminded Denby of something 
very like the snow that falls at ``Nutcracker'' time onstage and outside 
the theater. ``Each dance is instantly specific, it keeps its solidity 
as it rushes through the air, and is instantly gone,'' Denby wrote. 
``It has the grandeur of being complete, of asking nothing, of creating 
around its brief form a sense of airy stillness, of spacious calm.'' 
The New York City Ballet will perform ``The Nutcracker'' Friday night 
at 8, Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m. at the New 
York State Theater at Lincoln Center. Limited tickets for all shows 
this weekend are available for $15 and $25. Reservations: (212) 307-4100. 
The lead roles of the Sugar Plum Fairy, Cavalier and Dewdrop will 
be performed, respectively, by Kyra Nichols, Damian Woetzel and Wendy 
Whelan (tonight); Miranda Weese, Jock Soto and Yvonne Borree (tomorrow 
matinee and Sunday night); Ms. Nichols, Philip Neal and Alexandra 
Ansanelli (tomorrow night) and Ms. Whelan, Nilas Martins and Ms. Ansanelli 
(Sunday matinee). Performances continue through Jan. 3, with none 
on Christmas and New Year's Day. Tickets: $10 to $80. Information 
and performance schedule: (212) 870-5570.
