Ken Starr could be on the government payroll for at least another 
two years. A spokesman for the independent counsel says the time will 
be used to handle ongoing criminal cases, write a final report, and 
possibly prosecute President Clinton when he leaves office. There 
are three other cases on Starr's docket. Two involving Webster Hubbell, 
one of those is on appeal. And one involving Susan McDougal, who has 
refused to testify before Starr's grand jury.
