It was awfully expensive mouse feed. Mice in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg 
reportedly gnawed through dlrs 6,000 in cash dollars that a woman 
had been saving in a food jar _ a common alternative to Russia's risky 
banking system. The woman told officials at a local bank that she 
had saved dlrs 30,000 in the glass jar, which she kept in her cellar 
in Yekaterinburg, 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) east of Moscow, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday. The mice apparently ate through 
the plastic lid on the jar, which was among other jars that actually 
contained food. She brought the remains of the chewed-up dlrs 6,000 
into a branch of the Uralvneshtorgbank to see if they were worth anything, 
ITAR-Tass said. The bank often accepts mangled notes, but said this 
was its first experience with mouse-eaten money. The report did not 
say whether the bank could reimburse the woman for any of the damaged 
bills. Most Russians keep their savings in dollars because of the 
instability of the ruble in recent years, and many people have long 
been suspicious of depositing money in Russia's fledgling banks. Their 
fears have only worsened since August, when Russia's financial crisis 
crippled most banks, prompting them to freeze accounts because they 
couldn't pay off depositors _ and depriving millions of Russians of 
their savings.
