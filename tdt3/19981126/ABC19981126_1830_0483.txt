Across the country, there are so many places that have been closed 
to the public and shut off from the word because of pollution. In 
California, it looked like the town of Avila beach would join that 
list, because of an underground oil spill. But now, the company that 
cause the trouble has come up with a unique solution. Her's ABC's 
Brian Rooney. They started tearing down buildings on front street, 
much to the relief, and sadness, of many people who live here. To 
save Avila beach, they have to destroy it. To see people displaced 
and see the town that I grew up in destroyed pretty much, to be rebuilt, 
you know, it's not easy to watch. Avila beach is a quaint town of 
only 400 people. No stoplights or parking meters. Business caters 
to surfers, beachgoers and fishermen. The Unocal oil company is knocking 
down and digging up about 20% of the town and its beach. Out with 
the old, in with the new. For nearly 100 years, Avila beach was an 
oil town, a shipping and storage port. Storage tanks on the hill over 
town once dominated the view. Over the years, the oil leaked, leaving 
an enormous underground pool of oil and gas beneath the town. It didn't 
really get anybody's attention until we had some explosions under 
a building down the street. This is like living on top of the gas 
station only the tank lid is off. For ten years, the community fought 
with the Unocal oil company to take responsibility and fix the problem, 
and now they are. The significant thing about what's happening here 
is that they aren't just putting up a high fence around Avila beach 
and declaring it off limits. Unocal is taking 18 months and spending 
$200 million to clean up the underground mess. We found that this 
was probably the best solution allowing the community to come back 
as quick and expeditious as possible. Avila beach will be rebuilt 
to be similar, but not exactly the same. Everyone here knows that 
you can't rebuild the character that comes only with age and familiarity.
