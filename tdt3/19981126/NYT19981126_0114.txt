When John and Lisa Manuele of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., make cash gifts 
to their two sons for birthdays, Christmas and special events like 
first communion or confirmation, they emphasize how hard they worked 
to earn the money and urge the boys to use it wisely. Manuele suggests 
spending part of it for something they really want, saving part of 
it and giving part of it to charity. ``I feel it's important to pass 
the values I have on to them,'' he said. ``My grandfather did that 
for my father, and he did it for me, so I want to do it for them, 
and I hope they will for their children.'' The Manueles also regularly 
give the boys _ Matthew, 11, and Andrew, 8 _ larger amounts for college 
savings, and Mrs. Manuele, a brokerage firm executive, decides how 
to invest it. ``For small amounts of money,'' she said, ``mutual funds 
are generally best because of the diversification.'' The couple's 
financial adviser, Martin L. Greenberg, a partner in the New York 
accounting firm Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin, likes the tax advantages 
of giving to children. Under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, an account 
may be owned by a child for tax purposes, but the parent or other 
adult custodian controls it, generally until the child is 18 or 21, 
depending on the state. The first $700 of income each year is tax-free; 
the next $700 is taxed at the child's rate, generally 15 percent. 
After that, income is taxed at the parents' rate until a child is 
14, when all income is taxed at the child's rate. That means a sizable 
account balance can be built up before the income is subject to the 
parents' tax rate _ and if the holdings are in growth stocks paying 
little or no dividends, there may be no taxable income until the shares 
are sold to pay for college. Like many other parents, the Manueles 
are combining different purposes in making financial gifts to their 
children _ salting away savings for their college educations and teaching 
them the practical lessons of handling money and the virtues of thriftiness 
and generosity. But there is no one-size-fits all strategy for these 
goals. David B. Rhine, partner and national director of family-wealth 
planning for BDO Seidman, the accounting firm, said parents fell roughly 
into three groups: those with incomes low enough that their children 
are likely to qualify for financial aid for college; middle-class 
people, whose incomes are above the aid level but who must save regularly 
to meet college costs without borrowing, and the affluent, who are 
not worried about college costs but make big gifts to get assets out 
of their taxable estates. Whatever a family's finances, Rhine said, 
a gift to a teen-ager of a small checking account or low-limit credit 
card will offer invaluable experience in financial management. It 
is in disbursing the ``heavy-duty money'' that approaches vary, he 
said. Rhine advises parents in the first group: ``Build up your own 
retirement savings. It's very much pay as you go _ you can't make 
up a year that you missed.'' Some people struggle to put money into 
a child's account and then find scholarships reduced as a result, 
he noted. ``If the parent builds up his own 401(k), the money is on 
his court, not at the kid's end,'' he added, ``so it won't be counted 
in the formula.'' Then, if no aid is received, parents can withdraw 
retirement money. Beginning this year, the 10 percent tax penalty 
on early IRA withdrawals is waived if the money is used for qualified 
education expenses, and many 401(k) plans allow loans. The middle-income 
group may want to make regular gifts of securities, using a Uniform 
Gifts to Minors account. And the wealthy may want to make sizable 
gifts _ individuals may give $10,000 a year to an unlimited number 
of recipients with no gift or estate tax consequences. Because college 
payments do not count against the $10,000, Rhine noted, this group 
may prefer paying those costs directly. Steven Lockwood, president 
of Lockwood Pension Services Inc. in New York, said many parents set 
up trusts for gifts to children so they can control the money longer 
_ even to age 35 _ to make sure it isn't wasted on sports cars or 
ski trips. But trusts can cost several thousand dollars to establish, 
and some carry no tax benefits unless the dividends and earnings are 
distributed. ``Most kids will do the right thing,'' Lockwood said. 
``In 98 percent of the cases, it is not a problem.'' Brian H. Breuel 
of Princeton, N.J., author of ``Staying Wealthy,'' (Bloomberg Press, 
1998) recommended that people who want to make sizable holiday gifts 
to their children give stocks or other securities, not cash, ``because 
it is less likely to be spent.'' Some parents go to great lengths 
to leaven monetary gifts with symbolic significance. ``One of my clients 
likes to give his children $1,000 apiece for each day of Hanukkah, 
plus $1,000 each for the ninth candle and for birthdays,'' said Avery 
E. Neumark, a principal at Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin. ``So there's 
the $10,000.''
