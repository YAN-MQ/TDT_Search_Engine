The federal trade commission has a warning for smokers. Light or low-tar 
cigarettes may not be all they're cracked up to be. The FTC is starting 
an ad campaign telling smokers a test used to measure tar and nicotine 
levels may be inaccurate. Democratic senator Frank Lautenberg goes 
even further. He calls light cigarettes a sham, and wants the term 
banned from advertising.
