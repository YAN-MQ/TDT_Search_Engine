A terrible train accident in India's Punjab state has claimed up to 
150 lives and injured more than 250 others. Early Thursday, and pre-dawn 
mist that cut visibility to a few meters, a speeding express train 
rammed into coaches of a passenger train that derailed moments before. 
The crash was the worst train accident in India in at least three 
years. At last count, 36 of the injured were in critical condition. 
Thirty-five more passengers are missing and presumed dead.
