Rebels fired on a bus and a truck in northern Uganda, killing three 
people, then attacked another bus in the same location the following 
day, newspaper reports said Thursday. Rebels of the Lord's Resistance 
Army on Tuesday shot at a bus and truck driving through the village 
of Ancholi Bur, 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of the capital Kampala, 
The Monitor reported. The independent newspaper said the rebels flattened 
the bus tires, but the driver was able to continue to the town of 
Kitgum, 17 kilometers (10 miles) to the north. The rebels also fired 
on a civilian truck behind the bus, killing three people, including 
a policeman and a soldier, the newspaper said. Several reports said 
the LRA attacked the same bus line Wednesday in the same location, 
forcing passengers to flee into the bush. There were no reports of 
injuries in Wednesday's attack, though the tri-weekly newspaper The 
Crusader said many of the passengers who scattered following the gunfire 
were abducted by the rebels. Minister of State for Defense Stephen 
Kavuma could not confirm the attack. The LRA, which has bases in government-held 
areas of southern Sudan, has been fighting a 12-year insurgency in 
northern Uganda, targeting mostly civilians. The group often abducts 
children and young adults to use as bearers, fighters or sex slaves.
