Officials from five Central American countries devastated by Hurricane 
Mitch estimate it will cost them dlrs 4 billion to rebuild. ``This 
amount will be proposed to the international financial community that 
is willing to help in the area's reconstruction,'' Guatemalan Foreign 
Minister Eduardo Stein said Wednesday night after an eight-hour meeting 
of ministers from the five nations. The presidents of the Central 
American nations will travel to Washington on Dec. 9-11 to meet with 
representatives of the Inter-American Development Bank, the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Officials say more than 10,000 people 
were killed in Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa 
Rica. About 19,000 are still missing and almost 3 million were left 
homeless from last month's storm.
