Work crews in Washington state are struggling to reopen two major 
passes in the cascade mountains following heavy snowfall. Authorities 
closed them fearing the risk of avalanches. That has left at least 
4,000 holiday travelers stranded. Hotels in the area are full. Some 
people are waiting in hotel lounges and lobbies. There are other problems 
as well. In gig harbor, a mudslide pushed a house off its foundation 
and forced the evacuation of six other homes.
