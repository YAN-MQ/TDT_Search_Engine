The search for the cure to the common cold has been long, elusive 
and it has cost a lot of money. According to the most recent figures 
if you add it all up, Americans miss almost 21 1/2 million combined 
work days every year because of colds and coughs. Americans spend 
over $3 billion in over-the-counter remedies alone. But how could 
these days possibly be over anytime soon? NBC news chief medical correspondent 
Robert Bazell has our report tonight. For Dennis meehan, a bad cold 
means less joy this holiday season. His party's decorations not hung. 
It puts a damper on things. For many of us the holidays come with 
a cold. American adults catch an average of four colds a year. Children, 
eight. They strike most often when cold weather forces us to gather 
inside. So are we doomed to endless sniffles and sneezes? Dr. Tony 
fauci is in charge of infectious disease research for the government. 
When he testifies before Congress, after the talk of AIDS and other 
serious diseases, there is a familiar question. There's usually a 
comment as someone is kneesing and says one other thing, when are 
you guys going to cure the common cold? The answer -- maybe as soon 
as two or three years. Agouron pharmaceuticals, a San Diego company, 
designed a new drug now called ag7088. In the test tube, it stops 
the growth of so-called rhinoviruses. They're named for the Greek 
word for nose and they're responsible for 1/3 of colds. The company 
is now testing the drug at a facility like this where people get paid 
to get infected with cold viruses. A second company, called viropharma, 
is testing a different anti-cold virus drug in people. The results 
for both drugs should be available by next year. But scientists caution 
that to win approval, the drugs must prove to be especially good. 
You really need to have a drug that's effective very rapidly and that's 
very, very safe. Another promising approach -- ignore the viruses 
altogether and concentrate on the body's response. The flood of fluids 
that the body sends to try to destroy the virus but leaves us stuffed 
and sneezing. We probably wouldn't care if we had a virus in our nose 
if it wasn't producing symptoms. Antihistamines and decongestants 
already relieve the symptoms somewhat. But several companies are looking 
at drugs that could shut down the symptoms altogether. So I think 
that probably represents the new avenue, if you will, of treatment 
for the common cold. Until these cutting edge treatments prove useful, 
the old-fashioned advice remains best. To avoid infection, wash your 
hands frequently and stay away from others with a cold. If you get 
sick, rest and drink lots of fluids. Robert Bazell, NBC news.
