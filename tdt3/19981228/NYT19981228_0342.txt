In the new production of ``Electra'' at the Barrymore Theater, Zoe 
Wanamaker comes out onstage like a fist. ``Divine light, sweet air, 
again hear my pain,'' she says in Electra's opening speech. Tiny, 
with an upturned nose, glinty eyes, and a coat that is too big for 
her, Ms. Wanamaker looks like an adult whose soul has somehow been 
arrested in childhood. Because she can neither avenge the murder of 
her father, Agamemnon, nor forgive her mother, Clytemnestra, and her 
lover, Aegisthus, Electra remains suspended between childhood and 
womanhood. ``I'm a childless woman who is melting away,'' Electra 
says. ``She's a meteoric soul,'' Ms. Wanamaker said of the character 
she has been playing on Broadway to standing ovations since November. 
``She's a terrorist.'' The reviews for the production, Frank McGuinness' 
adaptation of Sophocles' play, were strongly positive. In The New 
York Times, Peter Marks called Ms. Wanamaker ``astounding.'' Electra 
is one of the theater's most taxing roles. She is a passive figure 
around whom events swirl. (Only in Euripides' version of the myth 
is Electra even present when her brother, Orestes, finally murders 
their mother in revenge for their father's death.) The part requires 
an actress who can transform suffering into action. It is the role 
of Ms. Wanamaker's career, and despite the exhaustion of eight shows 
a week, she is exhilarated. ``I knew,'' she said, in an interview 
in her Chelsea apartment. ``I knew America would love it.'' The agile 
Ms. Wanamaker, 49, jumped up to demonstrate her point, clapped her 
hands, clenched her fists, giggled. Darting about to make tea, rolling 
her own cigarettes, she is very different from the grief-riven figure 
at the Barrymore. Patches of her head are shaved and reddened onstage 
to look as if she has been tearing her hair out. ``I wanted her to 
look horrible, like hell,'' Ms. Wanamaker said gleefully. Onstage, 
Electra is in stark contrast to her mother, Clytemnestra, played by 
Claire Bloom in a filmy, low-necked red dress. ``Her mother who's 
abused her,'' said Ms. Wanamaker. ``She hates her. But she's her mother.'' 
Ms. Wanamaker's performance is the result of a long accumulation of 
personal experience. In a sense, she has been training for the role 
for 25 years. ``She has played alongside more great actresses _ Jane 
Lapotaire, Judi Dench _ than any other actor in the British stage,'' 
the director and playwright David Hare said in a telephone interview 
from London. Ms. Wanamaker has appeared in several of his plays. And 
as with Electra, Ms. Wanamaker has lived in the shadow of a powerful 
and beloved father, Sam Wanamaker, the American actor and director 
who for years campaigned to build a replica of Shakespeare's Globe 
Theater in London. Ms. Wanamaker's mother was the actress Charlotte 
Holland. Sam Wanamaker was ``an extraordinary, huge, imposing, rather 
wonderful, dignified person,'' said Howard Davies, who directed Ms. 
Wanamaker in ``Piaf.'' ``Zoe adored him. She wanted to follow in her 
father's footsteps, make moral decisions about her work.'' Sam Wanamaker 
died in 1993 and Ms. Holland in 1997, both from cancer. ``There are 
some performances when you can scream and shout and hang onto the 
curtains, and you don't feel it,'' Ms. Wanamaker said. But her grief 
in this performance is authentic, she said. ``This has a lot to do 
with the loss of my parents.'' The Daughter of `a Strong Liberal' 
Ms. Wanamaker was born in New York in 1949. The family moved to London 
when Ms. Wanamaker was about 3. Her father was later subpoenaed by 
the House Committee on Un-American Activities and was subsequently 
blacklisted. ``He was a very strong liberal,'' Ms. Wanamaker said. 
``When he did `Joan of Lorraine' with Ingrid Bergman, Daddy refused 
to play to a segregated theater.'' ``When he directed `Goodbye My 
Fancy,''' he continued, ``Ed Sullivan wrote that it was a pinko production. 
That started it. I don't think he was a member of the party. But a 
lot of people had great hopes for the Soviet Union.'' During the 1950s 
London was a haven for blacklisted American artists. Sam Wanamaker 
became a figure to reckon with, one of the first Method actors in 
England and one of the few Americans to act in the Royal Shakespeare 
Company, as Iago, with Paul Robeson. When Ms. Wanamaker told her parents 
she wanted to be an actress, they were horrified, she said. But she 
finally enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. 
``My ambition was to work in British repertory theater as much as 
I could. That was the training my parents believed in.'' She made 
her professional debut as Hermia in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' 
Early on, Hare directed her in a production of ``The Provoked Wife.'' 
``She was the most extraordinary mixture of self-confidence and self-doubt 
of any actor I've worked with,'' he said. ``She was possessed of an 
extraordinary fluency in the way she spoke. She seemed very damaged 
but sure of her ability to act.'' For 12 years on and off, Ms. Wanamaker 
worked in the Royal Shakespeare Company. In ``Othello,'' she played 
Emilia to Ian McKellen's Iago. American audiences saw her in Joe Orton's 
``Loot,'' for which she won a second Tony nomination for best featured 
actress. On the television series ``Prime Suspect,'' she was Moyra 
Henson, an ex-hooker who sticks with her companion despite the fact 
he might be a serial killer. She had a role in ``Wilde,'' a film about 
Oscar Wilde. But because of her perky looks, she was often cast in 
soubrette roles. ``She forced her way into being what she does now,'' 
said her husband, the actor and writer Gawn Grainger, ``a great classic 
actress.'' She broke through, she said, as Tessa, ``a very smart, 
bright businesswoman who changed her career and started to work for 
famine relief,'' in the 1992-94 BBC series ``Love Hurts.'' ``It changed 
my life completely,'' Ms. Wanamaker said. ``I couldn't walk down the 
street'' without being recognized. By 1993 her father was dying. But 
he appeared at a fund-raising event at the site of the new Globe. 
``It was raining heavily,'' Ms. Wanamaker told The Times of London. 
``He stood there in silhouette in the sheets of water, looking bigger 
than he was, thanking people for their generosity. It was like seeing 
Moses and Lear in one.'' After her father died, Ms. Wanamaker found 
comfort with Grainger, an old friend whose wife had also died of cancer, 
leaving him with two children, Eliza now 18, and Charlie, 22. ``I 
swore I'd never get married,'' she said. ``I was a child of the '60s 
to whom marriage was not a groovy idea. I'd been in three strong relationships, 
which were sort of marriages.'' Ms. Wanamaker and Grainger were married 
in 1994. ``I thought it was important for the children,'' she said. 
``After Daddy died ...'' She paused. ``We all confront our mortality.'' 
The role of Electra came about at the suggestion of the production's 
director, David Leveaux. He recalled: ``I said: `Don't you think it's 
time you had a really good scream? Why don't we do something we really 
want to do, something that is dangerous and a challenge?' I wanted 
to see her go up and show what she's got.'' `Too Many Greek Gods and 
Stuff' ``It had to be adapted because there are too many Greek gods 
and stuff in it,'' Ms. Wanamaker said. ``It gets in the way.'' In 
his adaptation of Sophocles, McGuinness did away with the lofty tone 
of previous productions, which were influenced by 19th-century conceptions 
of Electra. ``What the 19th century did was establish a heightened 
nobility, a loftiness in dramatic heroines,'' said Leveaux. ``Classicism 
is not style, it's necessity.'' Her performance was inspired in part, 
Ms. Wanamaker said, by a production of Strauss' ``Electra'' at Covent 
Garden. ``It was so theatrical, so outrageous,'' she said. ``When 
Clytemnestra is killed, there are 70 violins in the orchestra. The 
violins were screaming. It is the most sustained sound.'' Ms. Wanamaker 
first appeared in ``Electra'' in 1997, at the Chichester Festival. 
After the play was performed at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, 
N.J., the producers wanted to move it to New York. ``A lot of people 
turned us down,'' she said. ``Oh yes!'' she added. But ``they all 
came'' to the opening.
