The latest Congo Kinshasa peace effort has ended in Libya apparently 
with no face-to-face talks between President Lauren Kabila and the 
rebels who control most of the Eastern Congo. Mr. Kabila, Ugandan 
President Yari Musevani and rebel leader Earnest Wamba Diawamba flew 
to Tripoli for talks over the weekend with Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi. 
Uganda and Rwanda are helping the rebels in their war against Mr. 
Kabila. Like most African countries, including Mr. Kabila's allies, 
they want the Congo leader to negotiate directly with the rebels. 
But so far he has refused, blocking all attempts to reach a peaceful 
settlement to the five-month old civil war.
