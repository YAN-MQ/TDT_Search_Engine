Again U.S. targets have destroyed Iraqi targets. But this after being 
fired on by Iraqi offensive weapons. Meantime the very same president 
approving air strikes in the desert tries to cling to the high ground. 
And the wealthy, the adventurers who race yachts in some of the world's 
toughest waters. Tonight some of them are dead. Freak weather and 
a horrifying scene. And some of them didn't even get their 15 minutes 
worth. Those who seemed to burst on the scene this past year and then 
just seemed to burst and did you happen to catch their names? And 
good Monday evening to you. We have a lot to tell you about tonight. 
A member of the U.S. Senate standing by to talk with us. We will get 
a preview of what tomorrow morning's "New York Times" is saying about 
what's about to happen on the hill, a late update on some bad weather 
and bad timing for those traveling around the country and our roundup 
of the Tuesday morning papers here this Monday night.
