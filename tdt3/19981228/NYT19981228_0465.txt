The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 29, 1998: 
As the curbsides begin to disappear under bags of tinsel and leftover 
fruitcake, it is a good time to think not about what we bring home 
for the holidays but about what we throw away afterward. New York 
City's 7.3 million people, plus the 34 million or so tourists who 
will have been through town this year, produce about 26,000 tons of 
refuse a day. We dutifully recycle about 2,000 tons of that load _ 
an amount that should increase now that the city has wisely agreed 
to weekly recycling. That still leaves a lot of the smelly stuff, 
some commercial, some residential, that must be carted off and sent 
elsewhere. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani earlier this month announced his 
plans for closing the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, the world's 
largest dump, by 2002 and rerouting residential trash through major 
barge facilities in Brooklyn and New Jersey. As expected, New Jersey 
let out a protesting yelp and Brooklyn prepared alternative plans 
and protective lawsuits to block more garbage flowing into their respective 
areas. To no one's surprise, the process has quickly become noisy 
and complicated as other proposals like one at Port Ivory on Staten 
Island begin to sound intriguing. However, what may be most surprising 
to those watching the dumping war is that it concerns only about half 
the garbage the city gets rid of each day, about 11,000 tons. The 
other half is commercial trash, including such items as restaurant 
leftovers that are officially described as ``putrescible,'' which 
may offer a clue why many communities do not like them being trucked 
day and night through their neighborhoods. While the city recognizes 
two separate trash ``streams'' or systems _ residential garbage and 
the privately hauled commercial garbage _ the resident of Brooklyn 
or the Bronx who has bumper-to-bumper trucks running through the neighborhood 
has a hard time smelling the difference. Garbage is garbage, whether 
it comes from a one-family house or the Four Seasons. For that reason, 
Giuliani and his garbage experts, as well as the various groups interested 
in this weighty matter, should be looking at how all our tossables 
in black plastic bags will finally make their way out of the city 
after the closing of Fresh Kills. If marine stations are deemed best 
for residential garbage, why not consider them best for other garbage 
as well? City officials groan at the thought; they already have enough 
trash problems trying to close Fresh Kills without reconsidering the 
commercial system as well. City Hall may be able to thus compartmentalize 
this problem, but in the rest of the city it is all one big 26,000-ton-a-day 
issue.
