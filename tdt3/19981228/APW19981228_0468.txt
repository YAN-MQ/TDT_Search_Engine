A man using a stolen hearse to smuggle illegal immigrants led police 
on a high-speed chase Monday before escaping on foot, a report said. 
The smuggler allegedly stole the hearse Sunday from a funeral home 
in Maniaki on the border with Albania. He used it to transport seven 
Albanians who hid in the space for the coffin, the Macedonian Press 
Agency quoted police as saying. Patrol cars pursued the hearse after 
its driver failed to pull over. But the driver abandoned the vehicle 
and managed to escape, the agency said. The seven Albanians told authorities 
they paid the driver to transport them to the northern port of Salonica. 
Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants attempt to sneak across Greek 
borders each year. Some are sent home, while others manage to find 
jobs in Greece.
