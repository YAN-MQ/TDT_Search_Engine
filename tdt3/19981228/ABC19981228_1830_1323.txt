It's been a bitter year for farmers across the country, and the forecast 
for next year is grim. Experts predict income for farmers will fall 
by as much as 7%. Hog farmers in the midwest are in the worst shape. 
The global economic crisis has drastically reduced prices for their 
pigs. And as ABC's dean Reynolds reports, many small farmers are in 
danger of going under. Don Brady knows this is a lousy time to be 
a hog farmer. My banker says, "hey, you have some notes. You need 
to pay those off. You better get out of the hog business, because 
you're going in the wrong direction." And perhaps as many as 40,000 
other small pig farmers in the midwest are hearing the same thing 
this winter. That's because prices for their once-prized livestock 
are at a 50-year low. The price a farmer gets for a pig is far less 
than what it costs to feed and raise the animal. A year ago, Brady 
got 45 cents a pound for his pigs. Now, he's getting only 9 cents. 
My father has been farming for 62 years, and he's never seen products 
-- prices this low. What makes it so maddening for farmers is that 
only 18 months ago, pig market prices were at record highs. Everybody 
was doing well. So everybody produced as many pigs as they could. 
And in no time, they produced an enormous oversupply. The abundance 
of pigs came just as the export market for pork went into a Tailspin, 
with demand from Asia and Russia way off. Large corporate farms can 
withstand that decline in demand, but Brady and others like him cannot. 
Now we are in a situation where the industry ask locked into a structure 
in which the number of producers are getting smaller and smaller but 
what they are producing in quantity is getting larger and larger. 
While the price for a pig has plummeted, the price for pork at the 
supermarket has not. There's always a lot to like about the great 
taste of pork. Meat Packers and retailers are making hugeing high. 
And while some in Congress have called for an investigation of this 
imbalance, it would probably be too late for Don Brady and his way 
of life. This is the last of the hogs from this farm. When they grow 
to be market size, they'll be -- that will be the final chapter in 
the hog story. Dean Reynolds, ABC News, Chicago.
