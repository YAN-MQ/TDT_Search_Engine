Another easier way to control diabetes is showing promise in laboratory 
tests. There is help for people who are intensely shy and withdrawn. 
And loud music may actually be addictive. Jane Hughes has details. 
Until the discovery of insulin in 1921, the almost inevitable result 
of diabetes was death. Since then, diabetics lives have been saved 
by regular insulin injections, sometimes as many as four a day. The 
insulin is needed to prevent excessive acidity of the blood, a dangerous 
and sometimes life threatening condition known as diabetic kitoacidosis. 
Alternative insulin delivery systems are on the way. Insulin inhalers 
are already on the US market, and there is another promising alternative 
on the horizon, insulin pills. Until now, it hasn't been possible 
to take insulin orally because stomach enzymes break down the insulin 
before it has a chance to work. But researchers at Purdue University 
in Indiana, have created a gel that protects insulin so that it remains 
active until it can be released in the small intestine or colon. Purdue 
Biomedical Engineering Professor Nicholas Pappas says at that point 
the insulin can be absorbed into the blood stream. The gel delivery 
system has been shown to work in the laboratory and in rats, but has 
yet to be tested in humans.
