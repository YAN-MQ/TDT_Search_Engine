The United Nations mission in Angola has picked up an SOS morse code 
signal from a U.N.-chartered plane that crashed near a war zone in 
the central highlands, raising hopes that some of the 14 people on 
board may have survived, a U.N. spokesman said Monday. Hamadoun Toure 
said the United Nations is increasing pressure on the government and 
the rebel group UNITA to call a cease-fire and allow in a rescue team. 
``This may be last be our last chance to rescue innocent U.N. peacekeepers,'' 
Toure said by phone. The C-130 aircraft crashed Saturday at Vila Nova 
near the city of Huambo, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast 
of the capital, Luanda. U.N. communications specialists cannot tell 
whether the signals _ identified as coming from the plane _ are being 
sent manually or if they are just automatic transmissions, according 
to Toure. The 10 passengers on board included three Angolans, two 
Russians, an Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian and 
a Namibian. The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a 
Bolivian and a Filipino. Eight of the passengers were members of the 
U.N. Observer Mission in Angola which was overseeing implementation 
of the country's collapsed 1994 peace deal. Two others were employed 
by a private communications company, Dinacom, which works with the 
United Nations, Toure said. The plane, owned by TransAfric, was painted 
with the U.N. colors, and both the government army and rebels were 
informed of the flight's schedule before the aircraft took off from 
Huambo. The government says the plane was shot down by rebel forces 
and that it crashed in a UNITA-controlled area. UNITA Secretary-General 
Paulo Lukamba Gato denied his troops shot at the plane and said he 
had no information about its location. ``We don't know anything about 
it,'' Gato said by satellite telephone. ``There's heavy fighting in 
all that area.'' Gato said he had not received any U.N. request for 
safe passage to the area, and that he could not comment on the request 
until it was presented directly to the UNITA leadership. In Washington, 
the U.S. State Department issued a statement offering its condolences 
and adding its call for a cease-fire to aid search crews. The State 
Department also called on both sides to provide security guarantees 
and support to the searchers. The U.N. observer mission, deployed 
to monitor the peace accord that halted a two-decade civil war between 
the rebels and the government, has been unable to stop the renewed 
fighting. ``The government broke off dialogue with us, so now we're 
talking with weapons,'' Gato said. He added that he had no information 
on the number of casualties from the fighting, which erupted Dec. 
4. The main battles have focused on the central highland cities of 
Huambo and Kuito, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east, which provide 
a traditional powerbase for UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola. The U.N. Security Council 
has expressed dismay at Angola's apparent slide back to civil war. 
The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining independence 
from Portugal in 1975.
