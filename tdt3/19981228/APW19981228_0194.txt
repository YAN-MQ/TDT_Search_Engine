Mobs armed with sickles and swords on Monday battled each other and 
hurled gasoline bombs at houses and shops in an Indonesian provincial 
town. At least 22 people were injured in the outburst of ethnic violence. 
The riots in the town of Poso on Sulawesi island were triggered by 
brawls between rival gangs of youths a day earlier. The unrest escalated 
into attacks by townspeople on the homes of migrants from the main 
island of Java. Rioters set afire as many as 20 buildings and threw 
stones at the bus station, a local resident, Hajj Fatma, said by telephone. 
``The center of the town was blackened from the smoke billowing into 
the sky,'' Fatma said. She was preparing food for civilian guards 
who patrolled neighborhoods, fearing more violence. Police and soldiers 
were also deployed to protect government buildings and mosques and 
churches in Poso, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. 
Shops were closed and buses stayed off the streets. A nurse at the 
local hospital said by telephone that 22 people were injured and that 
the staff anticipated more victims. Fatma said she saw men bleeding 
from head wounds. Indonesia has endured sporadic riots this year amid 
economic hardship and rising ethnic and religious tensions. Deadly 
riots in Jakarta helped force former President Suharto to quit in 
May after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
