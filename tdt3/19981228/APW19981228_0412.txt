Iraq has no immediate plans to eject U.N. humanitarian workers who 
help distribute supplies to Iraqis under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food 
program, Iraq's trade minister said Monday. But the minister, Mohammed 
Mehdi Saleh, said the 2-year-old program was a temporary measure and 
could not substitute for meeting Iraq's demand of lifting U.N. sanctions, 
which limit its oil exports. ``Iraq will not live forever with the 
oil-for-food program. So, our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' 
he said. Saleh did not say whether Iraq will accept a renewal of the 
current phase of the program _ which allows the country to export 
oil worth dlrs 5.2 billion over six months _ when it expires in May.
