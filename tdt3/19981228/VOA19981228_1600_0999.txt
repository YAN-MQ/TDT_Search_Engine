Six people are feared dead in a violent storm that brought disaster 
to one of Australia's premier boating events, the Sidney to Hobart 
Yacht race. High seas, and gale force winds battered contestants in 
the race which began Saturday, as 115 yachts raced from Sidney down 
Australia's east coast to Hobart on the island of Tasmania. Two sailors 
were confirmed dead and four others were listed as missing as more 
survivors were plucked from the stormy seas Monday. Some 50 sailors 
have been rescued so far. At least 30 aircraft are looking for others. 
The competition is still going on, despite the weather conditions. 
Officials did not call off the race, but almost half of the yachts 
taking part in the annual competition abandoned their quest.
