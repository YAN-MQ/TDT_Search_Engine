As 1998 draws to a close, other news organizations are trotting out 
their top-10 story picks of the past year and asking your favorite 
commentators to make predictions for the next year. Well, you already 
know what happened last year and we don't know what's going to happen 
next year. Instead, we've asked some of our far-flung BBC correspondents 
to tell us where things stand in their parts of the world, as we head 
into 1999. We begin in Russia, where political chaos and economic 
decline have reigned all year. President Yeltsin has been in and out 
of the hospital and continually shuffling and re-shuffling his cabinet. 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is now considered to be the real power 
in Moscow. As the West worries about Russia's instability, Russia 
accuses the West of too often throwing its weight around. Reporter 
Alan Little says Russian officials continue to feel threatened by 
NATO expansion. One of the points that was made repeatedly, not only 
by the opposition here, but also by Yevgeny Primakov is a very hawkish 
character. The expansion of NATO is explicitly hostile towards Russia. 
In areas as -- which are traditionally regarded as part of Russia's 
sphere of influence, like the Balkans, the seven Balkans, Kosovo, 
South Serbia and so on. Russia regards everything, the United States 
and Britain does, in places like that, as directly threatening and 
hostile.
