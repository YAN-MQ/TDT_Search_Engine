The Metropolitan Opera's ``Die Fledermaus'' is funnier than ever, 
with a new book and English dialogue by musical comedy lyricists Betty 
Comden and Adolph Green. As in traditional versions, Falke is a buddy 
of the hot-headed Gabriel von Eisenstein who is heading to jail. Now 
called Dr. Fledermaus, the friend propels the plot to repay Eisenstein 
for a practical joke. The Comden-Green team has also transformed Eisenstein 
into a Viennese newspaper publisher who, on New Year's Eve 1899, is 
in trouble for punching a music critic who disparaged his soprano-wife, 
Rosalinde. And the duo depict Falke as a psychiatrist who, in the 
last scene, changes his name to Sigmund Freud. These changes allow 
new jokes, replacing those that Met audiences know too well. And one 
bigger change is cutting the last-act drunk scene by Frosch, the jailer 
of Bratwurst Prison. The success of the non-singing role depends on 
the actor. Max Wright, an actor in film, television and Broadway, 
handled the shortened part nicely. The last act's funniest visual 
joke remains. After midnight, when Frosch pulls the page marking the 
31 off his wall calendar, he uncovers 32. Though the dialogue for 
``Fledermaus'' is in English, the singing is in German. So, for their 
first operatic assignment, Comden and Green stuck to the general plot, 
which swirls along with Johann Strauss' lilting waltzes. Rosalinde 
was performed ravishingly by Carol Vaness; surely no critic would 
disparage her. Baritone Bo Skovhus, handsome and upbeat vocally, made 
his Met debut on Christmas Eve as Eisenstein. Though he's Danish, 
his English is American. Elizabeth Norberg-Schulz charmingly sang 
their maid, Adele, who beguiles Eisenstein at Prince Orlofsky's New 
Year's Eve party. Rosalinde, introduced as a Hungarian countess, beguiles 
him even more. The would-be philanderer, of course, doesn't recognize 
either of them. Jochen Kowalski as Prince Orlofsky has mastered looking 
bored _ the problem that made the prince a psychiatric patient in 
Comden and Green's conceit. He's a countertenor, which works well 
vocally. (A mezzo-soprano will eventually sing the role, standard 
since the premiere in 1874.) Tenor Michael Schade was properly self-absorbed 
as a former lover of Rosalinde, who launches into arias, favoring 
``Ritorna vincitor'' from ``Aida.'' In one joke for music insiders, 
Rosalinde protests: She doesn't want to sing opposite a tenor any 
more; Ernestine Schumann-Heink could sing Pinkerton. Actually, Schumann-Heink 
sang Orlofsky in ``Fledermaus'' in 1894 in Hamburg, with Gustav Mahler 
conducting. Comden and Green's first joke is for conductor Patrick 
Summers, who began his Met debut with the overture to ``Pagliacci.'' 
Just as in that opera, a baritone stepped in front of the curtain. 
Earle Patriarco performed Dr. Fledermaus, who establishes himself 
as a psychiatrist by blaming the conductor's start of the wrong opera 
on a dream he had last night. And his theories about dreams, he bragged, 
were ``spreading like hot strudel.'' David Kneuss brought new staging 
to the beautiful Gunther Schneider-Siemssen sets, and Robert La Fosse 
offered new choreography. No famous surprise guests appeared at Prince 
Orlofsky's party. That tradition wasn't followed; the new speaking 
parts were surprise enough.
