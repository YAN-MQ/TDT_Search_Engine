Dorothy Bird Nyswander, who was widely regarded as a primary promoter 
of U.S. public health education, died Dec. 18 at her home in Berkeley, 
Calif. She was 104. Dr. Nyswander was a founder of the School of Public 
Health at the University of California at Berkeley after World War 
II. Earlier, in the Depression, she pursued her interest in public 
health at the Works Progress Administration and after the war started, 
she served with the Federal Works Agency, playing an important role 
in setting up nursery schools and child care centers in 15 Northeastern 
states to accommodate young mothers working in defense plants. Because 
centers could not be created fast enough, Dr. Nyswander advocated 
the nationwide training of temporary foster parents who could look 
after the children of working women. In 1939, she served as director 
of the City Health Center in Astoria, Queens, and promoted the idea 
that New York City should keep close tabs on the health of its children 
through records that would follow them when they moved to new schools. 
Her written analysis of the health problems of New York youngsters 
was called ``Solving School Health Problems,'' and is still studied 
in public health education courses. She came to Berkeley in 1946, 
where she pioneered the application of behavioral sciences in public 
health. She was a professor of public health there until her retirement 
in 1957. She enjoyed good health until recently. Paul Mico, the executor 
of her estate who was also a student of hers in her final year at 
Berkeley, said that up until a couple of months ago, she had continued 
to receive former students at her home, where she conducted seminars. 
Dr. Nyswander was born on Sept. 29, 1894, the daughter of Albert Dixon 
Bird and the former Margaret Collins Miller. She earned bachelor's 
and master's degrees at the University of Nevada and in 1926 received 
a doctorate in educational psychology at Berkeley. Dr. Nyswander was 
married for more than 20 years to George Palmer, former director of 
research for the American Child Health Association in New York. He 
died in 1971. She was also the mother of Marie Nyswander Dole, a psychiatrist 
who pioneered the use of methadone to treat heroin addicts in New 
York and elsewhere in the early 1970s. Dr. Dole died in 1986. There 
are no immediate survivors.
