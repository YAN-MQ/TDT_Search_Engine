many college graduates are finding great jobs in computers and on 
computers. in today's "tech trends," marsha walton looks at the changing 
face of the high-tech job market. we have a list of all our job postings. 
and you can actually apply directly online. yoel lessing chose a job 
fair at a computer show to look for a position as a software engineer. 
according to "cio" magazine, there's a 10% annual turnover rate among 
high-tech workers. and with explosive growth in technology, recruiters 
at expos like these are competing aggressively for talent. right now, 
there is high demand and limited supply. so the value of these high-tech 
professionals is at an all-time high. high-profile athletes are not 
the only ones getting signing bonuses. the president of one online 
job search site says a $2,000 to $10,000 "incentive" is common for 
computer professionals. and these days, young workers have different 
demands from their parents' generation. a long time ago, a lot of 
people wanted that stability. they wanted to stay with a company for 
18, 20 years. right now, a lot of people, i've noticed, bottom line 
is, "hey, we like money." "cio" magazine lists training as the number 
one incentive. both two and four-legged family members are also important 
to the high-tech crowd. bring your dog to work. bring your kids. they've 
become very accommodating. for many, the chance to continue to learn 
and apply new skills is the most important perk. it's the challenge. 
when i'm sitting there installing routers, it's like a boy playing 
with legos. companies are finding more and more that they are using 
the internet as another way of getting candidates. as for yoel lessing, 
the las vegas job fair proved to be a good bet. he signed a contract 
with volt services before he even left town. and he's now testing 
software for microsoft. marsha walton, cnn, las vegas.
