EASTON, Maryland (AP) _ E.W. ``Skip'' Etchells, an influential boat 
builder who won many U.S. and international yachting championships, 
has died at age 87. Etchells, who died Dec. 20, designed the Etchells 
22. This design is now known as the International Etchells Class _ 
sailboats built to a specific design so that the outcome of racing 
depended on the skill of the crew rather than that of the boat builder. 
In the 1940s and the 1950s, Etchells dominated international competition 
in the one-design Star Class. In the 1960s, he created the Etchells 
22. He built Stars for 30 years and Etchells 22s for 20 years. In 
1951, with his wife, Mary, as crew, he won the Star Class world championship. 
She is the only woman to have won a world title in the popular boat. 
Etchells won the 1959 North American Star Class and many U.S. and 
international championships. Etchells grew up in Trenton, New Jersey 
and graduated the University of Michigan in 1936 with a degree in 
naval architecture and engineering. During World War II, he helped 
build destroyers and icebreakers for the Navy. After the war, he worked 
in New York for Sparkman and Stephens, the well-known yacht designers. 
After two years, he founded Old Greenwich Boat Co., which became a 
leading builder of Stars, Lightnings and other one-design boats. In 
1965 and 1966, the International Yacht Racing Union held a competition 
in Kiel, Germany, to choose a new three-man keelboat for the Olympics. 
The six entries included an Etchells-designed craft with a wooden 
hull covered with fiberglass. Although it won 10 of the 13 races, 
the officials chose a Soling. Sailors, however, praised his yacht, 
and he started production of the class that he called the Etchells 
22 because the boat's waterline length is 22 feet (6.7 meters). The 
design's first national championship was held in 1968. Etchells won 
it and sailed in Etchells 22 races throughout the 1970s. In 1984, 
he retired to Easton. He is survived by his wife, the former Mary 
O'Toole; a son, Tim of Middlebury, Vermont; a daughter, Anne Nieusma 
of Easton, and three grandchildren.
