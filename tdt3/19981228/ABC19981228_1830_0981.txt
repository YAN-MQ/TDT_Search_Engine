People aren't just shopping for books and toys on the Internet, the 
number of people investing online has nearly doubled in just one year. 
ABC's Betsy Stark reports, while the number of online investors has 
gone up, so has the number of online scams. One day, while California 
lawyer zane Smith was surfing the internet for investment ideas -- 
one of these advertising banners had a Little thing that said the 
next Microsoft. Smith clicked on the ad, which took him to the web 
site of a new company called interactive products and services. It 
described plans to make a wireless mouse and keyboard in one. Smith 
E-mailed for the prospectus, which impressed him. So I invested $1500, 
that was supposedly for 300 shares of stock. Retired engineer tobias 
Anthony invested $5,000. Unfortunately for both men, interactive products 
and services was a sham. There was nothing valid about it at all. 
None of the claims. ta-da. It's that easy to lose your money. Stock 
regulators say the case is a good example of just how easy it is to 
deceive investors on the Internet. While the scams themselves are 
as old as the stock market, the Internet has provided an effective 
new medium for perpetrating them. Everything that comes across the 
Internet looks very professional and very authoritative and there's 
no sort button you can push so that the bad information goes to one 
side and the good information goes to another side. What's more, in 
the time it takes a telemarketer to dial one phone number, an Internet 
stock promoter can reach millions of people all over the world. This 
is a problem we think is prevalent and persistent and it's a problem 
that we are going to continue to go after. Regulators are now cracking 
down. This fall, in its first-ever Internet sweep, the SEC charged 
44 stock promoters with using the web to defraud investors. But its 
work is far from over. Online investors send the agency hundreds of 
new leads every day. Betsy Stark, ABC News, New York.
