night dousing a burning freighter with water. flames broke out today 
in the engine room of the ship and spread throughout the vessel. the 
coast guard has rescued 23 people. two remain missing. authorities 
say they've had to call in oil spill crews because the ship is carrying 
more than 150,000 gallons of fuel oil. still, authorities say there's 
little danger of an explosion, or an oil spill.
