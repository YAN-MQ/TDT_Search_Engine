A United States Olympic panel has scheduled its initial meeting to 
probe allegations that Salt Lake City used bribery to win the bid 
for the 2002 winter games. Salt Lake City organizing committee officials 
will not attend the meeting on Washington on Tuesday. No agenda has 
been released, but the meeting is expected to build the framework 
for the investigation. Salt Lake City officials allegedly paid for 
scholarships for relatives of the International Olympic Committee 
members, and gave the members numerous gifts in violation of IOC rules. 
The US Olympic Committee probe will be headed by former senator George 
Mitchell, and we'll also include Baseball union head, Donald Fear. 
That's a look at Sports, I'm Jim Stevenson.
