The offseason purge of NFL coaches began quickly Monday. Within one 
hour, Dom Capers of Carolina, Dave Wannstedt of Chicago, Ted Marchibroda 
of Baltimore and Ray Rhodes of Philadelphia were fired. Seattle's 
Dennis Erickson was also fired, a Seahawks' source said. Capers and 
Rhodes, both former coaches of the year, have already been mentioned 
for vacancies. Capers is a candidate for the openings in Philadelphia 
and Baltimore, and Rhodes is a candidate in Green Bay, where Mike 
Holmgren has the option of getting out of his contract for a coach-general 
manager position elsewhere. All were expected because all had losing 
seasons except Erickson, whose Seahawks went 8-8 for the third time 
in his four-year tenure. They were 7-9 the other year, prompting owner 
Paul Allen, who has spent millions on free agents, to make the change. 
The biggest surprise may have been Wannstedt's dismissal in Chicago, 
even though he finished 4-12 for the second straight year. His team 
played hard every week and even owner Mike McCaskey conceded that 
the team's talent level was lower than needed to compete in the NFL. 
``This is a very disappointing day for me and my family,'' Wannstedt 
said at a news conference with McCaskey. ``I do respect his decision 
for making what he feels is the best decision for the organization.'' 
Wannstedt acknowledged that a number of mistakes in drafting and signing 
free agents were made during his tenure. ``We have a good nucleus 
of players and we need to increase the talent level,'' McCaskey said. 
Capers, the only coach the Panthers have had in their four seasons, 
was fired two seasons after taking the team to the NFC championship 
game in its second year. But Carolina finished 7-9 last year and 4-12 
this season as it fell apart on the field and within the locker room. 
Rhodes also lasted four years, taking the Eagles to the playoffs in 
his first two. But he fought with the front office from the start 
and this season the team collapsed, falling to 3-13 with the worst 
offense in the league. ``When you don't win, changes have to be made. 
This is part of the business,'' Rhodes said at a news conference with 
Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie. Marchibroda, meanwhile, came from Indianapolis 
to an unsettled situation in Baltimore, taking over the Ravens the 
year after they moved from Cleveland. The team was 16-31-1 under Marchibroda, 
including 6-10 this season. They won three straight games only once 
and never came close to reaching the playoffs. The firing left five 
vacancies _ June Jones of San Diego has already taken the coaching 
job at the University of Hawaii. Among other coaches whose jobs were 
in jeopardy were Dennis Erickson of Seattle and Norv Turner of Washington 
_ although any move in Washington wouldn't be made until the team 
is sold. Bruce Coslet of Cincinnati is also on shaky ground after 
a 3-13 season, although the Bengals will probably keep him so they 
don't have to pay the remaining years of his contract. San Francisco's 
Steve Mariucci still hasn't signed a contract extension and could 
move on, perhaps to the expansion team in Cleveland.
