Two children left alone at home died from smoke inhalation after starting 
a fire in the house, officials said Monday. The pair, aged 4 and 5, 
started a fire while playing with matches and died from inhaling carbon 
monoxide, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. The accident occurred 
Sunday in the eastern city of Donetsk and followed a similar accident 
last week, when four children in a central Ukrainian village died 
under the same circumstances.
