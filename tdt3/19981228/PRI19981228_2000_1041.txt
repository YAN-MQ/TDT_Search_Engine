There is joy in Teletubbie land today because the television show 
kids love and adults just don't get, is going Latin. Word has come 
that the hugely successful program with those irritatingly lovable 
little beings with the TV sets in their tummies, will soon be shown 
in Latin America. They're already gracing televisions in the U.S., 
Canada, even Estonia, Malaysia and Turkey. Brazil's main broadcaster 
is the latest to sign on. I guess the Teletubbies will now have to 
learn how to gurgle in Portuguese.
