The bodies of four foreigners who were beheaded in Chechnya earlier 
this month were to be handed over to British envoys on Monday, but 
the sides appeared at odds as to where the handover would take place. 
A spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow, Mike Haddock, said 
Britain wanted the handover to take place in the Russian capital, 
the Interfax news agency reported. But Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister 
Kazbek Makhashev said the separatist republic considered the proposal 
``unacceptable'' and wanted the bodies to be handed over in the nearby 
republic of Azerbaijan, Interfax reported. In that case, the bodies 
would have to be driven across Russia's region of Dagestan, which 
separates Chechnya and Azerbaijan, Makhashev said. Chechnya, which 
had fought a 1994-96 war for secession from Russia, adamantly tries 
to assert its independence from Moscow. No country has recognized 
its sovereignty. The bodies of the four men were found Saturday evening 
in the village of Chernorechiye, on the outskirts of the Chechen capital, 
Grozny. Doctors confirmed the identities of the bodies Sunday, according 
to Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov. British officials confirmed 
that the bodies had been identified by Chechen experts. But Britain 
has been unable yet to get an independent confirmation of their identity, 
Haddock said, according to Interfax. The four men _ Peter Kennedy, 
Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley 
Shaw _ were kidnapped Oct. 3, and their severed heads were found by 
a roadside on Dec. 8. A mourning service for the four was held Monday 
in the church of St. Archangel Michael in Grozny, the capital of predominantly 
Muslim Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Authorities said 
the men, who were in Chechnya to set up a cellular phone system, had 
been killed after a rescue attempt went wrong. The region, in the 
southern Caucasus, has seen a boom in crime and kidnappings for ransom 
since Chechnya's independence war ended.
