The urge to merge could hit the aerospace industry yet again. I'm 
Myron Kandel at the "CNN Financial News" desk in New York and this

with Britain's General Electric. Gec is not commenting on the reports, 
but such a deal could be worth up to $42 billion. Just last week, 
Lockheed-Martin said its profits will fall about 22%, below Wall Street 
forecasts due to slumping sales.
