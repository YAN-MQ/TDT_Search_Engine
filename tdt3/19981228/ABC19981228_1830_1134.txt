When we come back, trouble on the farm. A devastating year for hog 
farmers. It began as a way to give something back. You never knew 
you'd get so much in return. Throughout the day, with fixodent's long-lasting 
hold, you'll enjoy every moment-- right up until the very last thank-you. 
For long-lasting hold... my first boyfriend-- Rick whiting. I hadn't 
seen him in years. And we're at our 20th reunion catching up, and 
I get this terrible heartburn. But Rick hands me Zantac 75. "Thanks," 
I said. "So, did you ever become an accountant?" "No," he says, "A 
doctor." The medicine in Zantac 75 is the #1 doctor-prescribed acid 
reducer. It relieves even your toughest heartburn, controlling acid 
for up to 12 hours. Dr. Rick whiting. Zantac 75 for tough heartburn.
