Cambodia has rejected calls to try two high-ranking members of the 
Kamir Rouge. The pair defected to the government over the weekend. 
Cambodian Prime Minister Han Sen says a trial could mean a return 
to civil war. Human Rights Asia and other international Human Rights 
groups have called for the two men to stand trial for crimes against 
humanity. Cambodian government spokesman, Que Canarit says the government 
is aware of the international convention on genocide. The Cambodian 
tragedy is not like the holocaust or South Africa or what's happening 
in Bosnia. It's between Cambodia, but also we are aware that, according 
to the International Convention on Genocide, nobody can grant amnesties 
to the -- of the genocide. But we feel that now it's not appropriated 
to talk about it. Cambodian government spokesman Que Canarit.
