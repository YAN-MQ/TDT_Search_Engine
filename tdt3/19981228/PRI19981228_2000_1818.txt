For "The World," this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
U.S. warplanes have fired missiles at an Iraqi anti-aircraft position. 
Iraq says four soldiers were killed. Washington says the U.S. aircraft 
retaliated after Iraqi missiles were fired at them in the no- fly 
zone over Northern Iraq. Baghdad now claims an enemy plane has almost 
certainly been shot down. But Washington says, all aircraft returned 
safely. The BBC's Caroline Wyatt reports from Baghdad. Iraq is, once 
again, determined to portray itself as the victim of Western aggression, 
but one that's prepared to fight back in defense of its territory. 
This latest incident re-opens the contentious issue as the no-fly 
zones patrolled from the skies by the United States and Britain. Baghdad 
has made clear it regards that area as part of its own air space. 
And warned that the weekend, that it would fire on any planes patrolling 
its territory. Now it's made good that threat. -- unlikely to be the 
last such confrontation with both Baghdad and Washington determined 
to assert themselves in this battle of wills. Caroline Wyatt, BBC 
News, Baghdad.
