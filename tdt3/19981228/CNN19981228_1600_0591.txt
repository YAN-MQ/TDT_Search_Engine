Competitive boaters in Australia are continuing a major race, despite 
gale-force winds and fierce waves that have tossed around dozens of 
yachts. Two sailors have been killed and several are missing. Roger 
Maynard has more. It began in the idyllic setting of a sunny Sydney 
harbor on boxing day, and ended in tragedy. Among the missing, British 
Olympic sailor Glenn Charles who was aboard the australian yacht "sword 
of Orion." He was washed overboard when the boat rolled during the 
70-knot winds and mountainous seas which forced nearly half the 115 
craft to retire or seek shelter. It was the most grueling chapter 
in the history of the 54-year-old blue water classic which invariably 
hits bad weather. But fierce winds and waves as high as a two-story 
house made this one more treacherous than ever before. As the Australian 
Navy and air force join civilian planes and ships to mount a massive 
rescue operation, two men were confirmed dead aboard this yacht but 
seven fellow crewmen were winched to safety. One minute we had 80-foot 
underneath the craft, and the next minute, 10 foot. It took all our 
efforts and our training to get these people out. Survivors told of 
horrendous conditions which tossed the yachts around like matchwood, 
tearing down masts and rigging with unimaginable force. Very rough 
conditions. Probably the worst we've ever experienced in probably 
35 years of sailing, yes. Enormous seas. One when right under our 
boat, washed two guys overboard and then came straight back on again 
because they were on harness. But it was pretty exciting. Mayday, 
mayday. "Winston Churchill," "Winston Churchill." As the search continued, 
rescue helicopters picked up a distress call from the "Winston Churchill," 
seen here on a recent training run. The veteran 56-year-old cutter 
which took part in the inaugural sydney-hobart race had to be abandoned 
after taking water. Four of its crew of nine were missing for 24 hours 
before being picked up. In all, over 50 yachtsmen were winched to 
safety during the height of the storm. The race organizers pledged 
to hold a full inquiry into the tragedy as soon as possible. One official 
conceded that had they known what was to confront the fleet before 
it left, the event would have been delayed. Roger Maynard, itn, Sydney.
