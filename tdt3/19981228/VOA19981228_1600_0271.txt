And uneasy peace has taken hold in Serbia's Kosovo province after 
several days of fighting between government forces and ethnic Albanian 
separatists. The chief of the international monitors verifying compliance 
with peace efforts says, neither side has used their full fire power. 
He expressed hope for an end to the violence. But the chairman of

questioned whether they can continue to do their work without cooperation 
from both sides.
