The very same president who okayed today's air strike is preparing 
for the battle of his political life in the U.S. Senate, where any 
number of things could happen as Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial nears. 
NBC's Claire Shipman is with us tonight from the White House. Claire, 
good evening. Brian, almost no politician wants to see a long Senate 
trial and no one believes he would lose a vote in the Senate. But 
it has the possibility to be a damaging process. This White House 
knows it and it has been warned by democratic allies to keep its head 
down and keep quiet. The president focused his afengs on Iraq and 
the year 2000 computer problem. But his legal team, after cutting 
their holidays short, spent the day looking for any hints from Capitol 
Hill about how the Senate will proceed when it returns next week. 
The leading option being discussed -- a streamlined trial which could 
open on January 11th, no witnesses, short presentations and then a 
vote which would presumably acquit the president, and then a vote 
on a censure resolution. The goal -- to wrap everything up before 
the state of the union address on january 19th. But there are pitfalls. 
The president's legal team wants assurances there will be no surprise 
evidence or witnesses. Likewise, republicans would want to know that 
the president would accept censure. And the toughest part -- language 
in a censure resolution. Will the president admit he lied? Will republicans 
insist on that? As one adviser said, there will have to be more good 
will in this phase of the process in order to avoid a long, damaging 
trial. Brian? Claire Shipman at the White House tonight, thanks.
