President Mohammad Khatami on Monday urged oil-producing countries 
to move quickly to shore up weak world oil prices, which are harming 
Iran's economy, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. 
Khatami ``deplored the indifference shown by certain countries regarding 
the falling oil prices,'' the agency said. ``This is not acceptable,'' 
he was quoted as saying. ``We must reach a firm decision quickly in 
order to be able to defend our resources.'' IRNA said Khatami made 
the comments during a meeting with Qatar's new ambassador to Tehran, 
Hussein bin Ali al-Dowsari. Al-Dowsari expressed hope that members 
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce 
their production to boost prices, the agency said. Iran is at odds 
with other OPEC members, which have accused Tehran of failing to cut 
its production as much as it agreed to earlier this year. OPEC pledged 
output cuts totaling 2.6 million barrels a day last April and July, 
using February output as the baseline for the cuts. But Iran objected 
and said it would make its cuts from the quota it was assigned by 
OPEC in November 1997. That means Iran has been working off a base 
of 3.9 million barrels per day, rather than the 3.6 million barrels 
estimated to be its February output. Iran has said it is willing to 
attend an emergency meeting of OPEC and would support new cuts of 
1.5 million barrels per day by the cartel, provided the higher baseline 
level stayed in place. Both Iran and Qatar are members of OPEC. Iran 
has an output quota of 3.318 million barrels per day, and Qatar's 
quota is 640,000 barrels per day.
