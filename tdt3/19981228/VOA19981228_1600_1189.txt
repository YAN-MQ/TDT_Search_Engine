The curtain comes down on the 1998 National Football season regular 
season later today, as the Jacksonville Jaguars host the Pittsburgh 
Steelers in the weekly Monday Night Game. The Jaguars have replaced 
the Steelers as AFC Central Division Champions for the first time 
in their four year history, with a record of ten wins and five losses. 
They will host the New England Patriots Sunday in a wildcard playoff 
game. The Steelers failed to make the playoffs for the first time 
during headcoach Bill Cowers tenure, and could finish with their first 
losing season since 1991. Although the Steelers have won just seven 
games and eight losses in 1998, they have won five division titles 
during Cowers' six years at the helm. The Jaguars have lost their 
last two games and will give rookie quarterback Jonathan Quinn his 
second career start. Starting quarterback Mark Brunnell and backup 
Jamie Martin are both injured.
