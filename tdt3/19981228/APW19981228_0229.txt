The head of Britain's judiciary rebuked the country's highest court 
on Monday, saying its conduct in the case of Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
endangered the reputation of the legal system. Earlier this month, 
the House of Lords set aside its own ruling against the former Chilean 
dictator because one of the judges, Lord Justice Hoffman, failed to 
disclose his ties with the human rights organization Amnesty International. 
``We would not have wished this to happen,'' Lord Irvine, the Lord 
Chancellor, told BBC Radio. ``It is in the highest degree unfortunate, 
particularly when he eyes of the world are upon us. ... It does have 
a tendency to bring the legal system into disrepute.'' The decision 
means a new House of Lords panel must rehear Pinochet's claim that, 
under British law, his status as a former head of state gives him 
immunity from arrest on charges of murder and torture during his 1970-93 
rule. Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 under a Spanish arrest warrant 
while recuperating from back surgery in London. He remains under police 
guard at a rented mansion 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London. 
The general's lawyers, asking the House of Lords to reverse its earlier 
ruling, cited the maxim that justice must be done and also be seen 
to be done . They complained that Hoffmann should not have been allowed 
to sit in judgment of Pinochet since he is the director of Amnesty 
International's fundraising arm. Hoffmann was one of the majority 
judges in the Lords' 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 holding that Pinochet does 
not have immunity. In addition to Hoffmann's own role with the human 
rights group, the judge's wife has worked at Amnesty's London headquarters 
since 1977. Amnesty has played a key role in a long campaign to have 
Pinochet charged with gross abuses of human rights, and also made 
special representations in the first hearing before Hoffmann and the 
other law lords. But the group insists Hoffmann and his wife played 
no role in its efforts to try Pinochet. Irvine said Law Lords should 
declare their interests and ``should address together whether there 
are any circumstances that ... might give rise to an appearance of 
a conflict of interest.'' But he refused to say whether he thought 
Lord Hoffmann should face any disciplinary action. ``What is necessary 
is not to cry over spilt milk but see procedures are put in place 
to make sure this does not happen again,'' he said. The rehearing 
in the Law Lords is expected to take place Jan. 18.
