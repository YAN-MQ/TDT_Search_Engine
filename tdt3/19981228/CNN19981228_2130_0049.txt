the war of words between iraq and the united states is again turning 
into a war of actions. after a disputed incident over the skies of 
northern iraq today. david ensor has the story. pentagon officials 
say the incident started when a group of u.s. f-15e fighters was targeted 
by two iraqi surface-to-air missiles. a few minutes later, another 
iraqi missile was fired at a u.s. f-16 fighter. the missiles missed, 
and the u.s. air crews retaliated. the president said they did the 
right thing. the no-fly zones have been and will remain an important 
part of our containment policy. because we effectively control the 
skies over much of iraq, saddam has been unable to use air power to 
repress his own people or to lash out again at his neighbors. our 
pilots have the authority to protect themselves if they're threatened 
or attacked. they took appropriate action today in responding to iraq's 
actions. u.s. planes fired h.a.r.m. anti-radar missiles and dropped 
six precision-guided bombs on the iraqi anti-aircraft battery. though 
iraqi officials say the attack was unprovoked, pentagon officials 
say they can prove the planes were targeted by iraqi missiles. the 
incident is certain to increase tensions already heightened by "operation 
desert fox." over the weekend, over the no-fly zone in southern iraq, 
british fighters reported they were fired on by anti-aircraft guns. 
it'll be interesting to see if in fact there's a continuation of these 
events. if i were a betting man, there probably will be other events 
that will trigger responses. and that is the point that officials 
here stress -- that there could be no military advantage for iraq 
in threatening u.s. and allied planes, that such threats will always 
trigger firm retaliation. david ensor, cnn, the pentagon.
