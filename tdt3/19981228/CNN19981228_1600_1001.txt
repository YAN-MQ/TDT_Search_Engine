More job cuts in store for corporate America. I'm Lauren Thierry in 
New York with this edition of "Dollars & Sense." Auto partsmaker SPX 
says it will take a fourth-quarter restructuring charge of up to a 
quarter of a billion dollars, and it will eliminate 1,000 jobs in 
connection with its recent acquisition of general signal. As part 
of the restructuring, SPX will close about 25 facilities, as well 
as the Stamford, Connecticut-based headquarters of general signal.
