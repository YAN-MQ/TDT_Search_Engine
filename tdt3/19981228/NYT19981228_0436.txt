Defying international pressure to put top leaders of the Khmer Rouge 
on trial, Prime Minister Hun Sen said Monday that they should be welcomed 
``with bouquets of flowers, not with prisons and handcuffs.'' Preparing 
to greet two of the last Khmer Rouge holdouts _ Khieu Samphan and 
Nuon Chea _ at his home on Tuesday, Hun Sen said a trial would reopen 
old wounds and possibly lead to instability. Both men, who defected 
on Saturday, were at the very top of the Khmer Rouge hierarchy from 
1975 to 1979, when the group ruled the country and more than a million 
people were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork. 
``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look ahead to the 21st 
century with a clean slate,'' Hun Sen said. They are among the last 
of the movement's leaders to give up the struggle, and Hun Sen did 
not rule out a future Khmer Rouge trial, saying it was an issue for 
the judiciary _ which he controls _ rather than the executive branch 
to decide. The defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea leave only 
one major figure at large, Ta Mok, known as ``the Butcher,'' who seems 
to be as unpopular among his comrades as he is among his enemies. 
Hun Sen said Monday that he would extend no welcome to Ta Mok. The 
main Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in April. If the last two defectors, 
along with earlier ones like the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister, 
Ieng Sary, are not brought to trial, Ta Mok _ if he is captured _ 
could be the sole Khmer Rouge figure to be held accountable for the 
deaths and misery the movement caused. Hun Sen's remarks Monday were 
not the way he has talked in the past. In June 1997 he signed a letter 
requesting help from the United Nations in preparing for a trial for 
Khmer Rouge leaders on charges of crimes against humanity. In a weekend 
interview, Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. official who monitors human 
rights in Cambodia, said Hun Sen had repeatedly assured him that he 
planned to proceed with a trial. ``He said, `I agree completely that 
there must be justice,' '' Hammarberg said. `` `I promise you that 
no one will be spared.' He told me this several times.'' After years 
of struggle against political opponents, it is only in the last two 
months that Hun Sen has achieved full control of Cambodia's government. 
His stance Monday seemed to reflect a desire to avoid a situation 
that could get out of control. In addition, his words echoed a feeling 
among many Cambodians who are exhausted from decades of conflict and 
prefer not to stir up the demons of their past. ``If a wound does 
not hurt, you should not poke at it with a stick to make it bleed,'' 
Hun Sen said. ``If we put these two men in prison, will this benefit 
society or lead to civil war?'' This sentiment clashes with a contrary 
feeling among many foreigners _ and many Cambodians as well _ that 
a wound cannot heal until it is treated, even if the cure is painful. 
Human rights workers say a ``culture of impunity,'' with its roots 
in the unresolved cases of Khmer Rouge leaders, is to blame for much 
of the country's lawlessness and violence. Sidney Jones, the Asia 
director of Human Rights Watch, said in Washington that after a trial 
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea could be pardoned in the interest of national 
reconciliation if that is what Cambodians choose. ``But to allow these 
men to return to society as if one of the worst massacres of the 20th 
century never took place _ that's unthinkable,'' she said. At the 
United Nations, experts are preparing an outline of charges and legal 
procedures that could be used if a tribunal is created. One possibility 
would be to create a special court in a third country, like those 
trying people charged with committing genocide and other crimes in 
Rwanda and Yugoslavia. Another would be for Cambodia to set up its 
own special court with international help. Hun Sen brushed aside all 
outside advice. ``In Cambodia we know how to heal ourselves using 
our own medicines,'' he said. ``If we try mixing in foreign medicine 
it will not cure Cambodian diseases.'' He added: ``The interests of 
the nation and the people do not require a trial or conflicts among 
ourselves, but national reconciliation.'' Newspapers here largely 
support this stand. ``Cambodia should discard sentiments of vengeance,'' 
said the daily Rasmei Angkor. ``Even if we killed Khieu Samphan and 
Nuon Chea, the lives of those who died would not be returned to us. 
The best thing now is for all Cambodians to come together and love 
each other so we can find real peace.'' Noun Chea, 71, who was ``Brother 
Number Two'' under Pol Pot, and Khieu Samphan, 67, who was the official 
head of state, joined a community of defectors in the remote town 
of Pailin on Saturday. Both had spent most of their lives as revolutionaries, 
alongside Pol Pot. Khieu Samphan, the public face of the movement, 
returned to Phnom Penh once before, in 1991, and was attacked by a 
mob organized by Hun Sen's government. Nuon Chea was the man whose 
idea of creating a primitive agrarian society led to the forced evacuation 
of the cities and the massacres of the country's educated classes. 
A large number of former Khmer Rouge leaders are now nominally within 
government control in Pailin and elsewhere and are available for capture 
and trial, after more than two years of defections. But Hun Sen said 
the two latest defectors should be greeted with an embrace for giving 
up the fight. ``They will not come tomorrow with the political and 
military agenda of the Khmer Rouge,'' he said. ``They will come as 
simple citizens, bringing their wives and children and grandchildren. 
There's nothing for anyone to worry about.''
