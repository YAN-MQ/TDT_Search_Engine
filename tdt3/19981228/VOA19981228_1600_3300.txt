American authors are also looking to the future. As 1998 turns to 
1999, they are paying growing attention to the potential communication 
breakdown that could occur when computers can't read the two digit 
code for the year 2000. While much of what's being written about the 
Y2K crisis deals with practical and legal questions, there are also 
books like, "Spiritual Survival during the Y2K crisis, by author Steve 
Ferrarr. He draws on biblical scripture to offer advice on how to 
deal with possible social and personal upheavals. Diction writers 
also see fresh possibilities in the subject. In February, St. Martin's 
Press will publish, "Deadline Y2K" by Mark Joseph. The book is described 
as the first truly stunning thriller about the new millennium.
