Prime-time television has had an uneven record in employing and depicting 
blacks. Early shows like ``Beulah'' and ``Amos 'n' Andy'' have been 
heavily criticized for the caricatures they presented, but it took 
years for black actors to find better roles. In one particularly unsettling 
incident in the 1950s, the popular black singer Nat (King) Cole was 
unable to attract a corporate sponsor for his short-lived variety 
show, reportedly because of fears that Southerners might boycott the 
sponsor's products. One breakthrough came in 1965, when Bill Cosby, 
already popular with white audiences as a comedian, co-starred on 
``I Spy'' and eventually won three Emmys. In 1968, Diahann Carroll, 
who had already established crossover appeal as a singer and star 
of Broadway musicals, appeared in a popular series, ``Julia,'' about 
a black nurse struggling to raise her child after her husband, a pilot, 
had been killed in Vietnam. One of the first televised interracial 
kisses occurred in 1968, on ``Star Trek,'' when Captain Kirk embraced 
Lieutenant Uhura. And in 1970 the black comedian Flip Wilson started 
a successful variety show. The '70s were a time of enormous ferment, 
with a number of shows that had prominent black characters, including 
``All in the Family'' beginning in 1971, ``Sanford and Son'' in 1972 
and ``The Jeffersons'' (which had prime time's first interracial couple, 
the Willises) in 1975. ``Roots,'' the powerful mini-series about slavery, 
was broadcast in January 1977, with 130 million people watching at 
least some portion. Then, in 1984, ``The Cosby Show'' had its premiere 
in what became in many ways the high-water mark for broad acceptance 
of shows with predominantly black casts or themes. For many weeks 
during its eight-year run, it was the most heavily viewed show in 
the country.
