China has been hit hard by the economic slowdown, as well. It's responding 
to growing political unrest with a harsh crack down on prominent dissidents. 
Yesterday, labor activist, Chun Shen Gwan was handed a 10-year sentence 
for giving information to radio-free Asia. That's a U.S.- funded radio 
service. And last week, three leading pro-democracy activists were 
sentenced to 11-, 12-, and 13-year prison sentences for -- the China 
democracy party. Matt Frye says China is beginning to experience the 
repercussions of its economic reforms. Millions of workers have been 
laid off and spewed out by the more-advanced state industries. They're 
demonstrating on the streets of scores of cities in China. And that 
really has sent a very clear signal of fear to the Chinese government 
that they cannot reform the economy as much and as quickly as they 
wanted to, without creating a massive underclass. That will create 
huge political problems as it has done already.
