Appearing forever young is everybody's dream. But, biologists wonder, 
what good is immortality if all those extra years are accompanied 
by cancer? That's the quandary posed by the discovery earlier this 
year that a body substance called telomerase is an ``immortality enzyme'' 
that encourages cells to keep dividing indefinitely instead of dying 
with age. Scientists theorized that telomerase could be used to slow 
the aging process. At the same time, some feared that the enzyme could 
cause cancer by letting cell division run amok. Now, new experiments 
by the same University of Texas team of researchers have concluded 
that such fears are groundless. The researchers watched human cells 
divide hundreds of times in test tubes and concluded that telomerase 
does not by itself turn healthy cells into malignant ones. In fact, 
they said the enzyme may offer promising new ways to treat cancer. 
``Telomerase does not cause cancer progression,'' said Woodring Wright 
of the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, a co-author of the 
study, published Tuesday in the January issue of the journal Nature 
Genetics. ``The abnormalities seen in cancer are due to other mutations.'' 
Other researchers said the experiment is too limited to exonerate 
telomerase. They said that while telomerase may not cause cancer by 
itself, it appears to play a fundamental role in the growth of cancerous 
cells, even if the cancer itself is triggered by, say, radiation or 
a virus. ``There is no simple statement that telomerase is irrelevant 
to cancer,'' said Ronald DiPinho of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute 
of Harvard University. ``It's a very complex subject.'' Thomas Cech, 
a 1989 Nobel laureate and biochemistry professor at the University 
of Colorado, said the Texas researchers looked only at the effects 
of adding telomerase to a normal cell, not what happens when telomerase 
is blocked in a cancer cell. A year ago, Wright and colleague Jerry 
Shay published research demonstrating that telomerase enables cells 
to keep on dividing and avoid the normal process of aging and death. 
Normally, human cells divide about 75 times over a lifetime. But each 
time a cell divides, the telomere, or the protective end of a chromosome, 
erodes. Eventually, the telomere becomes too short to protect the 
chromosome. When that happens, the cell can no longer divide and eventually 
dies. By the time a person is an adult, most of their healthy cells 
no longer contain any telomerase. But 90 percent of cancer cells have 
been found to have telomerase, raising suspicions that telomerase 
is linked to cancer. In test-tube experiments, Wright and Shay showed 
that normal cell death can be avoided by inserting a gene that instructs 
the cell to produce telomerase. As of late December, the cells had 
divided as many as 220 times beyond their typical lifespan, and none 
exhibited cancerous traits such as abnormalities in chromosomes, the 
researchers said. At least a dozen pharmaceutical companies are in 
the early stages of developing drugs that would shut down telomerase 
and starve cancer of the tumor growth substance critical to its survival. 
Telomerase also is being considered for use in unclogging blood vessels, 
restoring circulation involved in some forms of blindness, and accelerating 
the healing of skin grafts.
