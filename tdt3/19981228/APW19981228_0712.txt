A thief made off with the silver slippers of a 250-year-old church 
image of the baby Jesus during a feet kissing ritual, news reports 
said Monday. The slippers, measuring 7 centimeters (2.76 inches) and 
adorned with a buckle and two emeralds, were stolen Saturday as worshippers 
filed passed the image to kiss its feet in the hermitage of the Roman 
Catholic Brotherhood of Our Lady of Charity, the state-owned news 
agency EFE reported. The image is attributed to the religious artist 
Duque Cornejo who also sculpted the choir in the cathedral of this 
southern Spanish city, the agency said. Brother Manuel Serrano told 
EFE that the thief must have acted quickly as the feet kissing faithful 
are watched over by members of the brotherhood. ``We don't think that 
it was an ordinary thief,'' the agency quoted Serrano as saying on 
the grounds that only an art collector would recognize their ``incalculable 
value.''
