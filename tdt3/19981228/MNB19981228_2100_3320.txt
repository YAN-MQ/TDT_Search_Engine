It was a year that saw a number of people turn into stars but very 
briefly look away and they were gone. NBC's Bob Faw tonight has a 
look back. This year they flashed by and then they were gone. Louise 
Woodward the nanny charged with murder, Al dunlap, the boss called 
chain saw, Frank capaci who won the powerball, William Ginsburg, Monica's 
attorney about town, each had 15 minutes of fame and then seemed to 
vanish. They get their moment. They get their little walk-on in the 
scene and then they disappear. Ask yourself whatever happened to Olympic 
gold medalist Tara Lipinski? To Oprah's film that was to be a blockbuster 
or to all the swordfish the famous chefs told us to boycott? Issues 
and personalities here today and gone -- We have disposable diapers 
and we do have some disposable celebrities. In his film, Woody Allen 
said the way we make and break celebrities is something very American. 
You can learn a lot about society by who we choose to celebrate. Just 
what was it we learned from that former teacher who volunteered he 
had had sex with Monica or from that aspiring actress who volunteered 
she'd had sex with Mr. Clinton or the Chicago physicist who caused 
a sensation when he said he would clone humans? Or from the woman 
who gave birth on the Internet? Try to remember any of their names. 
Clue -- none of them rhymes with Joey buttafuoco. There will always 
be a Joey buttafuoco. There will be more Joey buttafuocos because 
we've proliferated the number of celebrities we have in our society. 
Do you think your life will ever be the same? The nanny is back in 
England where she attends law school. Monica consort Andy blieler 
works in the theater. Actress Elizabeth Ward Gracen has not become 
a box office sensation. Frank capaci kept his lawn mowing job but 
no longer carouses with friends who bought the winning ticket with 
him. "Chainsaw" Al dunlap got mired in lawsuits and William Ginsburg, 
back practicing law in Los Angeles, now does comedy for charity. Damn 
it, what am I doing here? Nothing is as perishable as celebrity and 
nothing perhaps says more and about us. Bob Faw, NBC news, Washington.
