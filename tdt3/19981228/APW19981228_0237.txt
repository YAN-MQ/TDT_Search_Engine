Thousands of Romanians crammed hospital emergency rooms after stuffing 
themselves with pork, pickled cabbage and prune alcohol over Christmas 
holidays, local media reported Monday. About 3,500 Romanians called 
ambulances since Christmas Eve in Bucharest alone and thousands more 
were treated elsewhere for ulcers and gastritis over the weekend, 
Bucharest newspaper Libertatea reported Monday. Hospitals nationwide 
are prepared for more patients as Romanians continue the traditional 
indulgence of food and drink through to New Year's Day. ``It happens 
every Christmas due to excess of food,'' said Lucia Oana, a doctor 
with the state ambulance service in Bucharest. She said problems ranged 
from simple stomach aches to liver failure. National television showed 
images of emergency rooms crowded with patients holding their stomachs, 
many unable to speak and others too embarrassed to say how much they 
ate. Despite declining living standards, most Romanians managed to 
save enough for the traditional holiday meals of pork chops, cabbage 
rolls and dozens of other typical dishes washed down with prune alcohol 
and vodka. Doctors say sarmales, made of spicy minced meat and pickled 
cabbage, generally cause most cases of indigestion.
