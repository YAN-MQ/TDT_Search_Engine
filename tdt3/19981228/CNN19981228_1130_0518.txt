This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News" weather update. 
An area of low pressure will continue moving across the gulf of Mexico 
states, and also look for an area of low pressure to move off the 
eastern seaboard. Both of these cold fronts will cause a chance of 
rain and some frozen precipitation in the north. A strong front will 
be moving through the Great Lakes with the chance of snow, mainly 
to the north of the front, rainfall expected to the south. A high 
pressure Ridge building in means cold temperatures to the northern 
plains as we go into the middle of the week, and a new pacific storm 
means generally rain for the coast with snow for the rocky mountains. 
Temperatures across Alaska will be cold today, you'll see 16 degrees 
at anchorage, with snow, Fairbanks will be 9 degrees below zero. Under 
partly cloudy skies. Nationwide, temperatures will be mild in the 
south, you'll see readings in the 60s and 70s with colder temperatures 
in the teens 20s and 30s for the northern plains, the Great Lakes 
and New England. The extended forecast includes heavy rain in the 
northwest, Wednesday, with the rain-snow mix in the west Thursday 
and snow showers lingering in the east through Friday. The extended
