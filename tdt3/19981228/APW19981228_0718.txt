To eight out of 10 Russians, 1998 was a harder year than 1997, according 
to poll results issued Monday. Not surprisingly, Russians said the 
country's economic crash was the most important event of the year. 
Only 3 percent of the 1,600 people polled nationwide by the Public 
Opinion Fund said this year was easier than last year. Eighty-two 
percent said it was harder, the Interfax news agency reported. The 
Public Opinion Fund compared the results to a similar poll conducted 
10 years ago, when Russia was still part of the Soviet Union. Then, 
79 percent said the year had been harder than the previous one. The 
pollsters did not list the margin of error. However, it was almost 
certainly large enough that the results of the two polls a decade 
apart were statistically indistinguishable. In this year's poll, respondents 
were asked to name the three most important events of the year. The 
top three were the Aug. 17 economic crash, named by 43 percent of 
respondents; the killing of liberal political leader Galina Starovoitova 
(32 percent), and the resumption of high inflation (30 percent). They 
were followed by: Western air strikes against Iraq (25 percent); the 
introduction of new Russian rubles last January (22 percent); the 
dismissal of former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's government 
and the formation of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko's government 
(16 percent); and the dismissal of Kiriyenko's government and the 
formation of the current government under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
(15 percent). Besides the Iraq strikes, only one foreign event was 
named by a significant number of people _ the U.S. scandal involving 
President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, named by 13 percent of 
respondents.
