Holiday gatherings can be a source of dread and fear, especially for 
people who are shy or withdrawn. Dr. Una McCanne, chief of the Anxiety 
Disorders Unit at the National Institute of Mental Health, says there 
are two specific treatments for a social phobia. One is a form of 
psychotherapy known as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and the other 
is anti-depressant medication. Dr. McCanne says that without treatment, 
social phobia can be extremely disabling, not only during times of 
more intense social activity, but also for a person's work and family 
relationships. Dr. McCanne explains why, while a larger percentage 
of women have social phobia, more men seek treatment for the disorder. 
I think it has to do with the way our society is structured. First 
of all, its generally more accepted for a women to be shy, demure, 
somewhat withdrawn. In contrast, when a man stays at home, doesn't 
get a job, is a little wallflower in a party, people start to wonder 
what's wrong with that person. And so when men who have social phobias 
are sort of forced to take a job, they frequently encounter a brick 
wall, where suddenly they are unable to progress in their job or do 
their job unless they actually confront certain fears and phobia like: 
speaking in front of others, talking to authority figures, giving 
public presentations. And those are the things that drive men to therapy, 
typically. As to the causes of social phobia, Dr. McCannes says they 
are probably a complex combination of environmental and inherited 
factors.
