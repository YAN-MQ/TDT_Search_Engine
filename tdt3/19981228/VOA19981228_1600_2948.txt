The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 9226, that was up eight 
points, and it was the second time this year that the Industrial Average 
is closed up in seven consecutive sessions. Should we do it again 
tomorrow we'll make a new record. But the Standard and Poor's 500 
index closed at eight down almost one point at 1225, while the NASDAQ 
closed at a record high. Many analysts say the recent rally in the 
stock market is an attempt by traders to get ahead of an expected 
January runup in prices.
