Coming up -- frequent Flyers don't have to lose their wings. We'll 
tell you what some airlines are doing to let Flyers keep their miles. 
A new product in India may be flying off the shelves, but it's coming 
under criticism from some women's groups. Whoa! Remember this place 
and those midnight snacks? Hi, guys. Mindy! Let's have 2 dogs with 
the works. Hey, I can't have one of those now. Watching your figure? 
No, I didn't take my pepcid ac and it's too late now. Take my tagamet-- 
you can eat now. Tagamet introduces a better way to avoid heartburn. 
Not before, not after--now! Now you can take tagamet right when you're 
gonna eat and still prevent heartburn. Mindy? You two...back again? 
Mindy! With tagamet, you can eat like a kid again.
