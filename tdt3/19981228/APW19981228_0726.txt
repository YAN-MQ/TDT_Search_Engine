A Turkish prosecutor indicted 47 members of a pro-Kurdish party on 
Monday for staging a hunger strike in support of Kurdish rebel leader 
Abdullah Ocalan. Prosecutor Talat Salk is seeking up to 7 1/2-year 
prison sentences for members of the People's Democracy Party, including 
its leader, Murat Bozlak. The 47 were among thousands of party members 
who went on hunger strikes to oppose Turkey's bid to extradite Ocalan 
from Italy for trial. Salk based his indictment on charges that the 
party leaders were supporting a separatist armed organization. Police 
rounded up hundreds of party members throughout Turkey during the 
recent hunger strikes. The party and its leaders are already fighting 
several other court cases on charges ranging from making separatist 
propaganda to belonging to Ocalan's outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, 
the PKK. The PKK has been fighting for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's 
southeast since 1984. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
