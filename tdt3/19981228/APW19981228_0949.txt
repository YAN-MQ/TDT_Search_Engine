A bill that would force members of religious councils to swear allegiance 
to Israel's Orthodox chief rabbinate _ whatever their religious affiliation 
_ received preliminary approval Monday in parliament. The bill, sponsored 
by ultra-Orthodox legislators, seeks to circumvent a recent Supreme 
Court ruling that ordered religious councils in three cities to accept 
Reform and Conservative candidates as members. The bill, approved 
by 51 legislators and rejected by 46 in the 120-member Knesset, must 
pass two more readings to become law. The Supreme Court last month 
ordered Religious Affairs Minister Eli Suissa, a member of an Orthodox 
Jewish political party, to recognize Reform and Conservative candidates 
who were elected to the local religious councils as full members. 
Swearing allegiance to Chief Rabbinate would imply acceptance of its 
Orthodox tenets, and the bill's sponsors hope that would keep away 
the non-Orthodox. But Reform movement leader Uri Regev suggested that 
even if the bill were to become law, Reform and Conservative councilors 
might take the oath in any case, just to secure their place on the 
councils. ``If the law passes, the Reform and Conservative candidates 
will not be prevented from serving on the councils,'' he said. The 
Orthodox regard the bible as the revealed word of God. They see the 
modernization's of Reform and Conservative movements as diluting and 
even undermining Judaism. The two modern movements have small followings, 
but placing them outside the fold could alienate the Jewish community 
in the United States, where they have substantial followings. Religious 
councils are appointed by municipalities, and in recent years, parties 
that campaign against religious coercion have nominated Conservative 
and Reform representatives to the councils. The councils oversee the 
supervision of kosher eating establishments and have the power to 
license ritual baths. Their powers are less important to the Reform 
and Conservative movements then the symbolism of being allowed membership. 
Before the Supreme Court ruling, Orthodox officials had disobeyed 
the orders of lower courts, and had forcibly removed elected officials 
from council meetings. Labor party legislator Ofir Pines described 
the bill as ``a slap in the face of the high court of justice.''
