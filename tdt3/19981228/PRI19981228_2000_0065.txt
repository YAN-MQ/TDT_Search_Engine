For "The World," this is Pamela McCall in the BBC Newsroom in London. 
U.S. warplanes have fired missiles at an Iraqi anti- aircraft position. 
Iraq says four soldiers were killed. Washington says the U.S. aircraft 
retaliated after Iraqi missiles were fired at them in the no-fly zone 
over Northern Iraq. Baghdad now claims that an enemy plane has almost 
certainly been shot down. Washington says all aircraft have returned 
safely. President Clinton says the U.S. attack was an appropriate 
response. Once again, I want to tell you I am very proud of the work 
they do, the risks they take, the skill and the professionalism with 
which they do it. They attacked because they were attacked and they 
did the appropriate thing. We will continue to enforce the no-fly 
zones.
