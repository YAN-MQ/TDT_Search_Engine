Happy holidays, you're fired. I'm Anthony Keith James and this is 
"CNN Headline Sports." Within one hour's time, Philadelphia's Ray 
Rhodes, gone. Dom capers of Carolina, gone. Chicago's Dave wannstedt, 
gone. Ted marchibroda of Baltimore, gone. 13% of the NFL's head coaches 
were fired. The four had a combined record of 17-47 this season. It 
has been difficult the last couple of years, but we will press on. 
If you've been around professional football, you know that things 
can turn in a hurry. And that's why you can't ever get too full of 
yourself when things are going well, 'cause it's a humbling business. 
We gave it the good fight. I feel like I gave it the good fight, and 
things don't always turn out the way you want it to turn out. And 
the seahawks have fired coach Dennis Erickson. He's the fifth head 
coach let go today. In four seasons in Seattle he was 31-33 overall.
