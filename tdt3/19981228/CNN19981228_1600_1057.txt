For holiday shoppers, it was the mouse that roared. Holiday sales 
grew at an estimated 3.5% from last year. But published reports say 
online sales boosted an otherwise disappointing season. Cybersales 
more than tripled from a year ago. Some retail web sites were overwhelmed 
by holiday shoppers. Some sites, like Barnes & Noble and ebay, even 
slowed or crashed under heavy traffic. Overall sales figures were 
somewhat short of expectations, but many shoppers are planning to 
make additional purchases this week, with many items slated for postholiday 
markdowns.
