In his latest movie, "You've got mail", actor Tom Hanks plays a man 
who falls in love with a women he's never met, played by Meg Ryan. 
They carry on their courtship through E-mail, sent between his computer 
and hers. In real life, Hanks says he can understand how people get 
hooked on E-mail relationships, as his character did in "You've Got 
Mail". He describes as "thrilling" the experience of writing to a 
person you've never met. Hanks says that before there were computers, 
the closest thing to an E-mail relationship was striking up a conversation 
with the person sitting next to you on a long plane ride. Hank says, 
it's amazing what you will tell a stranger during a five hour flight.
