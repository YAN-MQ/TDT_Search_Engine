Auto parts maker SPX Corp. is cutting 1,000 jobs, or about 7 percent 
of its work force, as it integrates the operations of General Signal 
Corp., which it acquired in July. The company will close about 25 
manufacturing, sales and administrative facilities, including the 
former General Signal headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, SPX said 
in a statement Monday. The dlrs 2-billion deal created a company with 
about 14,000 employees and dlrs 2.5 billion in sales in the industrial 
and automotive businesses. The job cuts will come from the closings, 
an early retirement program and other actions, SPX said. SPX will 
take a dlrs 210 million to dlrs 250 million fourth quarter charge, 
before taxes, to cover the costs. SPX spokesman Charles Bowman refused 
to elaborate on details of the cuts and where they will be made. At 
the time of the merger, SPX said it expected to achieve annual cost 
savings of dlrs 55 million to dlrs 60 million, starting in the first 
quarter of 1999. However, on Wednesday, SPX said it expected about 
dlrs 20 million of costs associated with the restructuring will be 
incurred next year. Despite the costs, SPX chairman and chief executive 
officer John Blystone said the company remains confident it will earn 
dlrs 4.85 a share, excluding items, in 1999. Earlier this year, SPX 
attempted a dlrs 3 billion hostile takeover of Branford, Connecticut-based 
Echlin Corp. but was outbid by Dana Corp. of Toledo, Ohio.
