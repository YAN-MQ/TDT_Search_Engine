Holiday sales for Internet retailers, released Monday, revealed a 
huge season _ even stronger than predictions that earlier this month 
had seemed overblown, initial reports suggested. And while the the 
data were preliminary, they sent many E-commerce stocks soaring as 
the market got its first glimpse of the Internet serving a mass retail 
market. The increases were realized despite glitches that forced consumers 
to suffer indignities like being denied access to retailers' Web sites 
and holiday gifts that did not arrive on time as promised. The most 
optimistic estimates of holiday sales came from a subsidiary of InterPublic 
Group of Companies, whose survey of 1,000 consumers suggested that 
online sales would reach $5 billion. That would be four times the 
total sales last year on the Internet between Thanksgiving and Christmas 
and twice expectations for this year of $2.3 billion in sales. The 
Boston Consulting Group and Shop.org, the industry group for electronic 
retailers, said that year-over-year sales grew 230 percent in the 
holiday season that just ended. Apparel sales were particularly strong, 
growing to $300 million, from under $100 million in 1997, The Boston 
group said. In addition, the average order was $55, up 6 percent over 
last year's average. Still, all these projections were very preliminary 
_ most retailers will not release actual sales figures until mid-January 
_ and even the most optimistic would be far less than 1 percent of 
estimated $2.6 trillion in retail sales in the United States for the 
year. To put Monday's E-commerce estimates in perspective, Wal-Mart 
Stores, the world's largest retailer, did $118 billion in sales in 
1997 _ more than 23 times the most optimistic estimate of all holiday 
retail sales on the Internet this year. Those facts led many analysts 
to remain skeptical of the wave of euphoria generated by Monday's 
data. ``There is not enough evidence to justify'' InterPublic's $5 
billion estimate, said James McQuivey, a senior analyst at Forrester, 
an independent market research firm that specializes in Internet commerce. 
Moreover, the strong showing did not exactly cause jaws to drop. If 
an established company like IBM had reported such increases, it would 
have been the business equivalent of an Elvis sighting. But Internet 
sales have been growing rapidly all year. Julie Wainwright, chief 
executive officer of Reel.com, an online video store that was recently 
purchased by Hollywood Entertainment, explained: ``Our business is 
up seven times from last year. But that is not a surprise really. 
December is up 25 percent from November, and November was up 40 percent 
from October.'' What is more, examining just percentage rates of growth 
can be misleading because online retailers started with such a small 
revenue base compared with their brick-and-mortar peers. Still, the 
numbers, the first of the post-holiday season, clearly confirmed strong 
Internet shopping growth and the World Wide Web's potential for further 
expansion. Seizing on the data, investors snapped up shares of more 
Internet companies Monday, sending them to new heights. SkyMall Inc., 
for example, an in-flight catalog and Internet retailer, announced 
Monday that online sales of $1 million for the fourth quarter of 1998 
would be triple its sales in the same period in 1997. Its shares jumped 
$18.875 to $31.44 after touching $48 earlier in the day on heavy trading 
of 24.6 million shares. Shares of Amazon.com, the giant on-line bookseller, 
jumped $27.125 to $351.9375, and even promises of Internet sales produced 
winners. Active Apparel, a maker of women's wear, saw its share price 
increase 145 percent, to $3.0625 on Monday after it launched a Web 
site to which it said it would eventually add a line of men's swimwear. 
But while the shares of electronic retailers appeared to rise broadly, 
it was unclear whether small electronic merchants benefited from the 
holiday on-line frenzy experienced by the largest Internet retailers. 
Boston Consulting Group tracked only the leading electronic retailers 
in 17 gift categories. ``The seasoned merchants had room to shine,'' 
said Wendy Brown, AOL's director of electronic commerce. Of most significance 
to potential investors and E-commerce watchers, was the growth of 
new online shoppers. Ms. Brown said that a review of AOL's holiday 
figures showed that ``at any given point, 20 percent of the people 
online are there for the first time.'' Female shoppers also made a 
strong showing this Christmas. An InterPublic subsidiary, the Marketing 
Corporation of America, found that while women still trailed men in 
total number of Internet purchases, they were 9 to 11 percent more 
likely to make multiple purchases, spending $168 per month, on average, 
versus the $125 spent by men. The significant shift in the demographics 
of Internet shoppers, from male, typically technologically savvy users 
to a mass market may have its own price tag, however, in the form 
of higher expectations. ``Mass market users are far less forgiving 
of technology-related glitches,'' said Nicole Vanderbilt, senior analyst 
of digital commerce for Jupiter Communication, a New York-based market 
research firm. The as-yet unanswered question is whether online retailers 
this season provided the kind of pleasant and convenient shopping 
experience that would make first-time experimenters comeback for more. 
Certainly, they knew what was a stake. ``This Christmas was a make-or-break 
period,'' said Joe Kraus, senior vice president and co-founder of 
Excite, a portal and search engine. ``It's like the first time you 
go to a restaurant. If the food and service were good, you'll come 
back. If the food is cold and the waiter is rude, you'll never go 
there again.'' For some, the Internet clearly provided convenience 
as promised. ``I have a newborn baby so I couldn't leave the house,'' 
said Deborah Kamali, a gynecologist in Princeton, N.J.. ``I could 
be in my pajamas, breast feeding a baby and still go shopping on line.'' 
She ended up buying her son a video from Amazon.com and her husband 
a leather jacket from J.Crew and a cellular phone from AT&AMP;T. The 
Internet, she said, provided all the satisfaction of walking the aisles 
of a well-stocked store. ``It's great,'' she said. ``You can spend 
hours searching for movies and disks and books.'' nn But Jupiter's 
Ms. Vanderbilt said that, already, ``there have been some missteps 
by retailers during this critical period.'' She added, ``And we are 
just starting to hear the rumblings about what went wrong.'' Several 
sites, including barnesandnoble.com and Macys.com, had trouble processing 
customers' orders because of heavy traffic. Perhaps worse, several 
retailers, including Amazon.com, failed in their promises to deliver 
gifts by Christmas. To make a splash with consumers, 800.Com Inc, 
an online electronics, music and video store, offered three movies 
or CD's for $1 as a promotion in November. Suddenly, the site was 
swamped. It received some one million unique visitors this month to 
date _ 400 percent over its target, said the company's president, 
Greg Drew. The result was a two-day period during which the site had 
trouble processing orders. Drew estimates that some 50 percent of 
the CD's and movies ordered were delivered to customers after Christmas. 
``We thought it was better to have people wait a week or two than 
be disappointed,'' Drew said. Wiley consumers did find ways around 
the Internet's shortcomings. For example, Abby Tannenbaum, an editor 
in Manhattan, realized her gifts would be delivered late anyway, so 
saved shopping time by waiting until after the holiday rush. ``I tried 
to order a book from Amazon the day before Christmas, and it was way 
too slow,'' Ms. Tannenbaum said. ``So I waited until yesterday, and 
it was fine.''
