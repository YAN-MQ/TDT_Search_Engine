He has the presidential impeachment he sought from the House. Now 
Rep. Henry Hyde is in search of a strategy for an impeachment trial 
in the Senate. On Tuesday, Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary 
Committee, and the 12 other Republican congressmen he picked to join 
him in managing President Clinton's Senate trial will begin mapping 
out the prosecution's game plan, meeting for the first time since 
the historic House impeachment votes of Dec. 19. With some of the 
group already disagreeing over whether there is a need to call witnesses, 
and with very little precedent to guide them, the managers face a 
host of thorny issues, and are obviously not yet ready to go to trial. 
Although the Senate will most likely receive the formal charges next 
week after the 106th Congress convenes, Senate rules allow the White 
House time to respond to the charges, and the managers time to respond 
to that reply. All this, lawmakers say, could take two to four weeks. 
When they gather on Tuesday in the same conference room of the Rayburn 
House Office Building where Republicans on the Judiciary Committee 
drafted the articles of impeachment, the managers will review Senate 
procedural rules, assign responsibilities and debate which witnesses 
to summon, if any. Hyde, for example, may want to call Monica S. Lewinsky 
to testify about her relationship with Clinton, a House Republican 
aide said on Monday, even though two influential Republican senators, 
Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have said 
doing so would be unnecessary. ``The managers are now before a Senate 
jury,'' the aide said, ``and a jury needs to see some live faces. 
If nothing else, we could have Monica attest to the fact her testimony 
is true and she stands by it.'' All 13 managers are lawyers, and so 
it is perhaps no surprise that they differ sharply as to the best 
approach. Rep. George W. Gekas of Pennsylvania, who was a manager 
in the Senate impeachment trial of Federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings 
in 1989, said there was no need to call witnesses. ``We're going to 
make the case that there is already testimony under oath, in grand 
jury testimony and affidavits,'' Gekas said in an interview. But Rep. 
Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who is a former U.S. attorney, envisioned 
calling as many as 15 witnesses in a month-long trial. ``You diminish 
the impact of the evidence if it's simply stipulated instead of given 
in live fashion,'' Hutchinson said in an interview. One of Hyde's 
greatest challenges may be melding the hard-edged courtroom approach 
brought by the three former federal prosecutors on his team with the 
experience he and two other managers have gained from previous Senate 
impeachment trials of federal judges. The managers say they also are 
well aware of the public's desire, shared by most senators, to avoid 
a drawn-out proceeding. ``A senator's attention span is probably less 
than an average juror's, so we'll need to simplify, simplify, simplify,'' 
said Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, a manager who is also a former U.S. 
attorney. ``We have to pick out the best pieces of evidence and not 
throw everything up on the wall. If we get bogged down into making 
this into a complicated case, we'll lose votes.'' Indeed, Sen. Thad 
Cochran, R-Miss., said on Monday he does not understand why a trial 
should take more than a matter of days. ``I don't see any point in 
calling a lot of witnesses,'' said Cochran. ``We all know what the 
evidence is. Let the president make his defense and offer any motions, 
and then let's start voting.'' But the House managers have only limited 
control over the proceedings. The White House can present its own 
witnesses and evidence, and a majority of senators can vote to end 
the trial at any point. And with Senate Democrats and Republicans 
openly debating the merits of a censure _ apparently in recognition 
of the current conventional wisdom that there are not the 67 votes 
needed to remove Clinton _ the managers worry the plug might be pulled 
on their case. ``It's really all guesswork,'' said Gekas. Indeed, 
uncertainty extends even to preliminary procedural steps. Hyde expects 
to formally present the two impeachment charges against Clinton _ 
perjury before the federal grand jury and obstruction of justice _ 
to the Senate sometime next week, after the 106th Congress convenes 
on Wednesday, but he does not know exactly when. That decision rests 
with Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, who has 
been consulting with the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of 
South Dakota. Meantime, Hyde's aides have been meeting quietly with 
Lott's chief of staff, David Hoppe, and one of Daschle's top aides, 
William V. Corr, to discuss the outlines of a trial schedule and other 
logistics. ``They're just talking through how it could proceed, what 
documents the House has,`` said one Senate Democratic aide.
