TWA union leaders say they were not behind dozens of TWA flight attendants 
calling in sick over the Christmas holiday. More than 200 flights 
had to be canceled and the airline's St. Louis hub was paralyzed. 
Union officials say TWA flight attendants are mad they don't have 
a new contract, but there was no "sickout." They say this year's absences 
were similar to last year's. The union and airline are scheduled to 
resume contract talks January 18th.
