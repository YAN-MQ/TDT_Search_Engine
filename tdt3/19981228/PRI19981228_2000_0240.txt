is on. They're searching for yachtsmen missing after a storm hit the 
annual city to Hobart race. At least three men are dead, another six 
are still missing. But the 700-mile race continues, despite its worst 
tragedy. One of -- organizers, commodore Hugo Vancrestar, says it's

the race has always been run in accordance with the International 
yacht racing rules which, very clearly, stipulates that its skipper's 
decision whether to participate in a race in the skippers -- whether 
or not to continue in a race. That's been the protocol by which this 
race has been run since it first came to being. Commodore Hugo Vancrestar.
