And in US news, a bus returning passengers to New York City from an 
overnight stay in Atlantic City, New Jersey has crashed as it entered 
the New Jersey Turnpike. All 31 people on board were hospitalized. 
The bus slid off the road early Sunday, hit a tree and came to rest 
in a wooded area. The crash came just three days after another bus, 
carrying casino patrons from New York to Atlantic City, overturned 
on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey killing eight passengers 
and injuring the others.
