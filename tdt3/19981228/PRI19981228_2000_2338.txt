In Africa, another war is raging. Rebel forces in Congo are trying 
to oust President Laurent Kabila who, himself, ousted Mobuto Sesi 
Seko last year. At least six other nations have become embroiled in 
the conflict. Correspondent Jane Stanley says it's being called Africa's 
first world war. You've got Uganda, Rwanda, Chad, rumors of Sudan, 
we've got Nnambia, Angola, Zimbabwe, all fighting there. And really, 
nobody seems to know how on earth they're going to stop this war, 
which I see intensifying and getting worse. I covered the -- the war 
intensely that brought Kabila to power and I didn't think I would 
come back to see, so quickly, another war start in a country that 
is so potentially rich.
