Iraq accused the United States of ``aggressive and vicious'' behavior 
Monday after U.S. warplanes fired on its anti-aircraft guns, killing 
four soldiers. The U.S. attack came two days after Baghdad announced 
it would fire at Western aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones over 
northern and southern Iraq. The Iraqi casualties were the first since 
the United States and Britain ended four nights of airstrikes on Dec. 
19. Iraq says those raids killed 62 Iraqi soldiers and at least 40 
civilians. In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the U.S. pilots 
opened fire in self-defense: ``They attacked because they were attacked, 
and they did the appropriate thing.'' The official Iraqi news agency 
later quoted an army spokesman as saying a ``an enemy plane'' had 
been shot down by Iraqi forces during the exchange. ``We declare that 
our air defense batteries almost certainly shot down an enemy plane 
and search is underway for the plane's wreckage and the pilot,'' the 
spokesman reportedly said. ``It's possible that the American authorities 
did not announce the shooting down of the plane so they give their 
pilot a chance to escape, if he is alive, or give their agents an 
opportunity to retrieve his body, if he's dead.'' But U.S. officials 
said all U.S. planes has returned safely. ``It's totally not true,'' 
said David Leavy, spokesman for the White House's National Security 
Council. ``This is just more propaganda from Saddam Hussein.'' British 
officials also said that all of their planes had returned safely. 
The incident occurred as Baghdad sought Arab sympathy for the Iraqi 
people, which had emerged in widespread protests against the U.S.-British 
airstrikes. Iraqi delegates to an Arab Parliamentary Union meeting 
in Amman Sunday had pressed the conference to call for Arab states 
to violate the U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq. But the Arab legislators 
did little more than repeat condemnation of the airstrikes. An Iraqi 
military spokesman said earlier that Monday's initial clash began 
when Western aircraft ``approached one of our air defense weapons 
sites ... and fired criminal missiles.'' ``These criminal and vicious 
actions led to the martyrdom of four of our valiant soldiers and the 
wounding of seven others,'' the unidentified spokesman told the official 
Iraqi News Agency. The spokesman said the aircraft came in two waves. 
Iraqi air defenses ``confronted'' the first group ``with all valor 
and capability.'' The second wave of warplanes killed four soldiers 
and wounded seven, the spokesman said. U.S. pilots said the Iraqis 
launched three missiles and used radar to lock onto U.S. planes, said 
a U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The 
Americans scored at least two direct hits against the anti-aircraft 
site, the official said. In Washington, a U.S. Defense Department 
spokesman said the clash took place near Mosul, 400 kilometers (250 
miles) north of Baghdad. In Stuttgart, Germany, a spokeswoman for 
the U.S.-European Command, Maj. Tony Kemper, said the U.S. planes 
fired anti-radar missiles and precision-guided munitions. The United 
States and its allies set up the northern no-fly zone to protect Kurdish 
rebels after the 1991 Gulf War. The southern zone was established 
in 1992 to protect Shiite Muslim rebels. Earlier Monday, Iraq's trade 
minister said the country has no immediate plans to eject U.N. humanitarian 
workers who check the distribution of supplies under a U.N.-approved 
oil-for-food program. Mohammed Mehdi Saleh added, however, that the 
2-year-old program was a temporary measure and could not substitute 
for a lifting of U.N. sanctions. ``Iraq will not live forever with 
the oil-for-food program. So, our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' 
he said. Saleh did not say whether Iraq would accept a renewal of 
the current phase of the program, which expires in May. The trade 
minister made the remarks at a news conference to clarify comments 
he made Sunday in an interview with Associated Press Television News 
in which he said Iraq would reject a continuation of the oil-for-food 
program. ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands 
lifting of sanctions, and this means the ouster of U.N. teams which 
supervise it'' he said in the Sunday interview. The program allows 
Iraq to export dlrs 5.2 billion in oil over six months. It is an exception 
to the sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
