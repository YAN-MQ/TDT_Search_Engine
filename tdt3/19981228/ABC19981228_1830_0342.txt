Across the southeast tonight, heat and power are still out in many 
places after an ice storm that hit on Christmas eve. As ABC's Barry 
Serafin reports, for thousands of people across the region, the bad 
weather has created a very unpleasant holiday season. Five days after 
the ice storm knocked out power across the south, thousands of people 
from Tennessee to Alabama are still without electricity. Virginia 
was hit the hardest. Officials today reported that three elderly people 
without electricity have died of hypothermia. 70,000 people in the 
southeast part of the state are still waiting for the heat and lights 
to come back on. At one point, 360,000 people here were without power. 
2,000 utility workers are putting in 16-hour shifts every day, but 
in many places, trees, power lines and even power poles have been 
snapped by the ice, leaving snarled wires and limbs. The weight of 
the ice and all has really done ya' in down here. I've never seen 
anything like it. Billy and Tammy griggs, of prince George, Virginia, 
had to leave their home when a tree fell on it. All of a sudden, you 
hear a crumble and a bump and it sounds like shotguns going off. Look 
at it. I mean look, look at the door. Since their frightening experience 
on Christmas eve, the griggs have been living out of bags and boxes 
in a motel, with their little dog, cody. It's been a living nightmare. 
It's one Christmas I'll never forget. Many others, have also spent 
their holiday in motels and shelters. But progress is being made. 
Utilities say power could be fully restored by the end of the day 
wednesday. But the clean-up and repairs will take longer after Virginia's 
worst ice storm in five years. Barry Serafin, ABC News, Washington.
