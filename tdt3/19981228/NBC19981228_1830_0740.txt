This is Dan Lothian in Los Angeles where the chill from the deep freeze 
in California has already reached the supermarket. Navel oranges, 
special advertised just before Christmas five pounds for $1, today 
up 400%, 99 cents a pound. The consumer is going to see a price increase, 
well over $1 a pound. For some consumers, this sudden and dramatic 
increase sours their appetite for citrus. Yes, I will buy fewering 
ons and lemons. But California growers, who supply 80% of oranges 
the nation eats, are feeling the brunt of the deep freeze. Crop damage 
estimated at more than $500,000. See the juice start to come out and 
start to drop off it. In Fresno county, Keith nilmeier lost 85% of 
his crop when temperatures dipped into the teens for many hours three 
nights last week. Farming is like a Gamble. If we didn't make it this 
year, we hope to do better next year. But the Gamble is paying off 
now for farmers in Florida. The navels we're packing now are bringing 
in more of a premium price. It's supply and demand. It's simple, you 
know, and supply has tightened up. Florida, Texas, and Arizona will 
try to meet the demand. It will be a boon to the growers in those. 
They'll see the increased revenue from the sales. The up and downside 
of a market that relies on weather no one can control. Dan Lothian, 
NBC news, Los Angeles.
