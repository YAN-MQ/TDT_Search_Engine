Thomas P. O'Neill, the former House speaker, and the humorist Finley 
Peter Dunne were fond of asserting that ``all politics is local.'' 
Now the Television Bureau of Advertising is seeking to extend that 
saying from the voting booth to the cash register. The bureau, the 
New York-based trade association that represents local television 
broadcasters, is undertaking what is being described as its first 
large-scale effort aimed at marketers and agencies to promote the 
benefits of running commercials locally rather than nationally. A 
television, print and direct-mail campaign by Fitzgerald &AMP; Co. 
in Atlanta, now getting under way, carries the theme ``Local TV: A 
better connection.'' The campaign, with a combination of $1.2 million 
in paid spending and donated commercial time valued in the millions 
of dollars, is the first work from Fitzgerald, owned by the Interpublic 
Group of Companies, since being awarded the account after a review 
several months ago. ``Local television is not on the radar screen,'' 
Ave Butensky, president of the association, said in a telephone interview 
Monday. ``It needs to be more visible.'' ``Advertisers have so many 
choices,'' he added. ``We want to see what we can do to create awareness.'' 
Additional details about the campaign are to be discussed at a news 
conference Tuesday. Robert Coen, who predicts ad spending trends for 
McCann-Erickson USA in New York _ part of the McCann-Erickson World 
Group unit of Interpublic _ forecasts that spending by national advertisers 
for commercials on local broadcast stations will increase 4 percent 
in 1999 from 1998. By comparison, he estimates national spending on 
cable television will rise 12 percent next year compared with this 
year. Coen also predicts that spending by local advertisers on television 
commercials will grow 5 percent in 1999 from 1998. The campaign comes 
as the cable television industry is intensifying attempts to capitalize 
on gains in viewership by persuading advertisers to increase budgets 
designated for cable or to switch spending to cable from broadcast. 
That is particularly true on the local level as so-called interconnects 
seek to make it easier to buy time on cable systems. Butensky said, 
however, that the campaign's message ``is not a broadcast-cable issue.'' 
Rather, he added, the purpose is to focus on what he called the strong 
points of ``localism,'' especially ``the ability to reach your best 
customer _ geographically, demographically, psychographically _ with 
local television because of greater program selection and targeting 
abilities.'' ``Some soap products do better in soft-water markets 
than in hard-water markets and vice versa,'' he said. ``General Motors 
may need to say something to potential customers in California different 
from potential customers in Detroit. And power drills sell better 
in Texas than in New York; in New York, I kiddingly say, you call 
the super.'' The campaign delves into those distinctions in several 
ways. One commercial and a companion print ad, playing on the use 
of regional expressions, carry the headline ``It's hard to sell `pop' 
to people who drink `soda.''' Another headline advises: ``Nothing 
helps you speak to a community like local TV. Except maybe a giant 
loudspeaker anchored to the roof of your car.'' A commercial elaborates 
on that idea by showing a man on a bustling city street, standing 
outside a large office building. He shouts into a bullhorn a conversation 
meant for a Dr. Kessler inside the building, describing an embarrassingly 
personal medical condition. As the details echo for blocks around, 
a newsstand operator, passers-by _ and soon after, the police _ make 
clear their dismay and displeasure. ``When you want to talk to someone, 
why talk to everyone?'' the spot asks. ``Use local television to really 
connect with your audience.'' The commercial borrows a page from popular 
films like ``There's Something About Mary'' in that some moments may 
lift the eyebrows of tradition-minded viewers. There is a brief discussion 
of bodily functions, for instance, and a sight gag involving a blind 
man. ``It's a comical approach, an absurd situation,'' Butensky said, 
``meant to be farcical.'' Besides, he added, in tests by Fitzgerald 
the spot ``had the highest recall scores'' of any idea the agency 
put forth. The campaign will run in the trade publications Advertising 
Age, Adweek, Brandweek and Mediaweek. Promotional materials will also 
be mailed to executives at agencies and client companies responsible 
for planning national ad budgets. The commercials are being sent this 
week to members of the bureau, which includes more than 500 local 
television stations, owners of station groups and advertising sales 
representatives who sell local commercial time. So far, Butensky said, 
more than 300 stations in more than 130 local markets have agreed 
to donate time to run the spots. Maybe they can stimulate interest 
by billing the commercials as the debut of a series called ``There's 
Something About Local TV.''
