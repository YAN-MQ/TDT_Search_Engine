American warplanes patrolling a ``no-fly zone'' in northern Iraq fired 
at an Iraqi air defense site Monday after coming under attack, U.S. 
officials said. Iraq said the missiles killed four Iraqi soldiers 
and injured seven others. U.S. President Bill Clinton said the pilots 
only fired after being fired upon. ``They attacked because they were 
attacked, and they did the appropriate thing,'' he said in Washington. 
However, the Iraq Information Ministry claimed its moves were defensive 
and forced the ``evil'' warplanes to flee. U.S. and British jets patrol 
a ``no-fly'' zone over northern Iraq that was set up in 1991 to protect 
Iraqi Kurds after their failed uprising against Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein. Monday's incident occurred just north of Mosul, according 
to the Pentagon. Major Tony Kemper, a spokeswoman for the U.S.-European 
Command based near Stuttgart, Germany, said the planes were attacked 
by Iraqi surface-to-air missiles. ``The aircraft acted in self-defense 
and attacked the ground-based missile launch site with HARM (High-Speed 
Anti Radiation) missiles and precision-guide munitions,'' she said. 
``There was no damage to coalition aircraft and all crew returned 
safely to Incirlik airbase (in Turkey).'' She added that officials 
were still trying to assess the damage to Iraqi forces. Two Iraqi 
missiles were fired, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity. ``There was a hostile Iraqi action, an act 
of aggression against U.S. aircraft,'' Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard 
Bridges said. ``The U.S. took appropriate action under their rules 
of engagement.'' In London, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense 
said its planes were not involved in Monday's incident. However, Bridges 
said, over the weekend two British tornado planes reported seeing 
anti-aircraft fire from Iraqi sites about five miles (eight kilometers) 
away. He had no further details about that incident. The casualties 
Monday were the first reported by Iraq since a four-day bombing campaign 
by American and British forces ended Dec. 19. Iraq said 62 soldiers 
and at least 40 civilians died in those airstrikes, but never gave 
a final civilian casualty count. ``The murderers and criminals returned 
once again and violated our national airspace,'' today's Iraqi statement 
said, adding that ``several enemy formations'' entered Iraqi airspace 
at 10:25 a.m. from Turkey. Iraqi air defenses ``confronted them with 
valor and forced them to flee to their bases of evil and aggression 
in Turkey,'' the statement said. Another wave of Western planes entered 
Iraq at 1:37 p.m. and ``fired criminal missiles against one of our 
sites,'' it said, adding that this killed four soldiers and wounded 
seven. Earlier Monday, Iraq's trade minister said Iraq has no immediate 
plans to eject 400 U.N. humanitarian workers who monitor an oil-for-food 
program. In earlier statements, minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said 
Iraq would not agree to extend the program and therefore the U.N. 
workers would have to go home. Saleh said the 2-year-old program was 
a temporary measure and could not substitute for meeting Iraq's demand 
of lifting U.N. sanctions, which limit its oil exports. ``Iraq will 
not live forever with the oil-for-food program. So, our demand is 
... to lift the sanctions,'' he said. Saleh did not say whether Iraq 
will accept a renewal of the current phase of the program _ which 
allows the country to export oil worth dlrs 5.2 billion over six months 
_ when it expires in May. The trade minister spoke at a news conference 
he called to clarify comments he made Sunday in an interview with 
Associated Press Television News. ``Iraq refuses the continuation 
of this project and demands lifting of sanctions, and this means the 
ouster of U.N. teams which supervise it'' he said Sunday. The program, 
which is an exception to trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 
1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows the country to export limited amounts 
of oil to buy food and medicine for its 22 million people, who have 
been hard hit by the sanctions. U.N. workers monitor the program to 
ensure that the Iraqi government does not divert any of the money. 
Also Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called for a quick 
review of Iraq's weapons program as a condition for lifting sanctions 
and again warned the United States against using force.
