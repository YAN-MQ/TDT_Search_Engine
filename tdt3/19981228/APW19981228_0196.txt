Ho Chi Minh City's economy grew by 9.2 percent this year, down from 
12.1 percent in 1997, an official from the city's statistical office 
said Monday. Despite the decline, the growth in gross domestic product 
in the country's economic engine was still much higher than the national 
figure of 6 percent. Annual per capita income in the former Saigon 
rose to dlrs 1,172 from dlrs 1,119 last year, the official said. But 
spending increased only 2.2 percent this year, compared with 11.3 
percent in 1995, 9 percent in 1996 and 3.7 percent last year, she 
said. The country has been hit hard by the Asian economic crisis, 
with sharp drops in exports to the region and investment from it. 
In a report to the National Assembly last month, the government said 
it will try to maintain positive GDP growth next year.
