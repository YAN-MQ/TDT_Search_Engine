When we come back -- NBC news "in depth." Fighting off the common 
cold. How close are they, really, to actually finding a cure? Take 
that laxative, and you could ruin your trip. Maureen!! It's got stimulants 
that may cause pain and cramping. Says who? Says on the label. Don't 
you know nothing's better than Phillips' milk of magnesia? All these 
overnight laxatives have stimulants that may cause pain and cramping. 
Phillips' doesn't. It's the only one that and nothing's more effective. 
And you know Phillips' is really... she never takes a vacation.
