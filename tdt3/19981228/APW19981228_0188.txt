Hong Kong stocks slumped Monday in extremely thin trading after the 
Christmas holiday. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 122.06, or 1.2 
percent, closing at 10,170.14. On Thursday, the index had gained 133.45 
points. The market was closed on Friday for Christmas. Turnover fell 
to 1.222 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 156 million), its lowest 
full-day trading level since March 23, 1989. Brokers said there was 
selective profit-taking following last Thursday's gains, but that 
many investors remained on holiday. ``There's very little news'' to 
move the market, said Alan Hutcheson, research director at Pacific 
Challenge Securities Ltd., Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.25 
Hong Kong dollars to 56.75, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 75 cents 
to 57.50. In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 4.00 dollars to 
195.00, and Hang Seng Bank fell 1.75 dollars to 71.00. Elsewhere, 
Hutchison Whampoa fell 75 cents to 55.00, and Swire pacific ``A'' 
fell 10 cents to 35.60.
