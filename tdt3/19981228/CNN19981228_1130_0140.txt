And fog blanketing much of the San Francisco bay area is tying up 
holiday travelers. Delays of up to three hours were reported at San 
Francisco international airport, with many flights to nearby cities 
canceled. Other incoming flights were diverted and passengers had 
to be bused into the San Francisco. Some weary travelers were not 
looking forward to the prospect. I remember years ago I took a bus 
ride and there was no sleeping in the bus stations. They -- a guard 
came by, and hit me with his nightstick one time, he said no sleeping. 
I hope they don't do that here.
