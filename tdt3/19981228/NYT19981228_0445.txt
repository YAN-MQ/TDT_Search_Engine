A Long Island-based rap musician known for his colorful antics was 
arrested Sunday night in Manhattan and charged with criminal possession 
of a weapon after the police said they found a loaded, unregistered 
.45-caliber pistol in his 1995 Mercedes-Benz. The musician, Trevor 
Smith, who goes by the stage name Busta Rhymes, faces up to seven 
years in jail if he is convicted of the weapons charge. His arrest 
comes a week after his new album made its debut at No. 13 on Billboard 
magazine's top-100 sales list. Smith, 26, whose frenetic stage persona 
and cartoonish costumes set him apart from ``gangsta'' rap musicians 
who have been criticized for promoting violence, was stopped by the 
police on the West Side Highway near 18th Street. Gerald Odom, 25, 
Smith's road manager, was riding in the musician's car at the time. 
Neither man has a criminal record, according to court documents. After 
pulling Smith over for changing lanes three times without signaling, 
Officer Anthony Curtin looked in the back seat of Smith's car, prosecutors 
said. Using a flashlight, he was able to see a gun sitting in an open 
bag, they said. Odom was searched and found to be carrying a small 
bag of marijuana, the police said. He was charged with unlawful possession 
of marijuana and criminal possession of a weapon, the .45-caliber 
pistol. The rap musician, the son of West Indian immigrants who moved 
to Long Island from Brooklyn in the early 1980s, told Curtin, `` `I 
got robbed twice _ that's why I have the gun,' '' prosecutors said. 
Smith's lawyer, Robert Kalima, would not comment on the specifics 
of the case but said the rap musician was innocent. ``We are investigating 
what occurred,'' he said. The arraignment of Smith, who has a part 
in ``The Rugrats Movie'' and is scheduled to be host of Black Entertainment 
Television's countdown of best videos of the year on New Year's Day, 
caused a brief stir in the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building on Monday. 
While court officers scratched their heads and struggled to pronounce 
Smith's stage name, some younger female court employees seemed to 
stir with excitement at the thought of seeing him. After receiving 
assurances that Smith would appear in court again, Judge Thomas Farber 
released both men on their own recognizance and ordered them to return 
on Jan. 28. Asked if he had anything to say as he left the courtroom, 
Smith grinned and said, ``Peace now.''
