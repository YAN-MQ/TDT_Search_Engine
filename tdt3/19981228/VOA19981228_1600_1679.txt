a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania claims credit for inventing the smiley icon for computer 
correspondence on E-mail, or electronic mail. The symbol is the combination 
of a colon, dash and parenthesis. It looks like a smiley face turned 
sideways - you've seen it. The icon is popular among many computer 
users who also have come up with additional ways to create faces and 
symbols by using computer keys. Professor Scott Paulman says he thought 
up the smiley face back in 1980 during the early days of E-mail, because 
he thought people took their on-line messages all together too seriously. 
Professor Paulman says he never thought the smiley idea would become 
as big as it did. He has one regret, that he did not save that first 
E-mail message that used the smiley face icon.
