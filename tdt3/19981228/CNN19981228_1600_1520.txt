They've been around for more than 100 years. Now, a Texas man says 
it's time sewing machines get their day in the sun. Jeff crilley from 
our affiliate kdfw reports. Well, the sewing machine is one of the 
greatest inventions ever on earth, and I thought it's been overlooked 
for years. He's on a one-man mission to make sure that sewing machines 
are restored to their rightful place in history. They've kept museums 
for cars and guns and watches and everything else. And I say, "well, 
gosh, there should be a sewing machine museum and no one's ever done 
it." So I decided maybe I could become the first, and I did. Museum? 
It's more like a shrine. Normally, machines pull the material from 
front to back. When it comes to large sewing machine collections, 
Frank Smith has the title all sewed up. -- And actually sewing sideways 
-- The guy has more than 300 antique sewing machines. So what? Well, 
just wait till you see the one he's got outside. The world's largest 
sewing machine. The needle's over 14 inches long. Oh, gosh, it took 
me eight months to build this. Just this wheel alone, took me over 
a week to build the wheel. Now, it's open to the public. Welcome to 
the sewing machine museum. But you have to understand that Frank doesn't 
get many visitors. Saw this through the auto club. So Frank decided 
if the people wouldn't come to him -- then he figured he'd just have 
to bring his museum to the people. So Frank has built himself the 
world's only sewing machine museum on wheels. It's so crammed with 
sewing machines, it's bursting at the seams, so to speak. And it's 
ready to come to a festival near you. And as an added bonus, Frank 
and his daughter will be glad to serenade you with their sewing machine 
song. The song of the sewing machine Like I said, Frank is a big fan 
of the sewing machine. In his mind, they're a stitch in time. And 
so, where his museum is concerned, he wouldn't dream of doing anything 
just "sew-sew." Machine Jeff crilley, reporting for CNN.
