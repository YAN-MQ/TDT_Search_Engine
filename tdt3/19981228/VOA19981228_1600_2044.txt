In Angola, the UN special Envoy has made an urgent appeal to the UNITA 
rebel movement for assistance in connection with the weekend crash 
of a UN cargo plane. VOA's Alex Boliter reports from our Southern 
Africa Bureau. The appeal by UN special envoy Esa Dialo comes after 
Angolan government sources told the United Nations, the C-130 cargo 
plane came down in an area near the town of Huambo controlled by UNITA 
forces. Mr. Dialo says in his statement, the United Nations needs 
the rebel groups assistance to determine the exact site of the crash, 
and to provide immediate relief to any survivors. The UN chartered 
plane went down on Saturday with 14 people on board. Angolan authorities 
have accused UNITA of shooting down the aircraft. For its part the 
rebel movement has blamed the government for the incidence by allowing 
planes to fly in a war zone. UNITA has admitted shooting down another 
aircraft earlier this month near Quito another embattled central Angolan 
town. Alex Bolita, VOA News, Southern Africa Bureau.
