President Clinton had what he labeled some good news for older Americans 
today. He announced that the social security administration has fixed 
the so-called millennium bug in its computers. That means benefit 
checks can be sent out on time come the year 2000. Despite today's 
success story, computer experts note this is just one federal agency, 
one that was very worried about senior citizens marching into the 
streets in protest burning torches and there are many others that 
have not fixed the bug as yet.
