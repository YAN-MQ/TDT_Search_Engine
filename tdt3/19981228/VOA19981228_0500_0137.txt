The United Nations has called for a 48 hour cease-fire between the 
Angolan government and the UNITA rebels to allow a safe search for 
a UN plane that crashed Saturday with 14 people on board. The transport 
plane went down in flames shortly after taking off from central Angola. 
It is not known if any of the 10 passengers or four crewmembers survived 
the crash in an area thought to be under UNITA control. UN World Food 
Program suspended flights in Angola pending further information.
