"Patch Adams" is proving laughter is the best medicine and draw for 
moviegoers. The film, starring Robin Williams as a medical student 
with a funny bedside manner, was number one at the box office this 
weekend. It brought in just over $25 million. "Stepmom" was in second 
place, earning an estimated $19.4 million. It was the best debut for 
a film starring Susan Sarandon and the second-best opening for Julia 
Roberts. And "you've got mail" rounded out the top three movies. The 
romantic comedy took in $19 million.
