Iraq has no immediate plans to eject U.N. humanitarian workers who 
help distribute supplies to Iraqis under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food 
program, Iraq's trade minister said Monday. But the minister, Mohammed 
Mehdi Saleh, said the 2-year-old program was a temporary measure and 
could not substitute for meeting Iraq's demand of lifting U.N. sanctions, 
which limit its oil exports. ``Iraq will not live forever with the 
oil-for-food program. So, our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' 
he said. Saleh did not say whether Iraq will accept a renewal of the 
current phase of the program _ which allows the country to export 
oil worth dlrs 5.2 million over six months _ when it expires in May. 
The trade minister made the remarks at a news conference to clarify 
comments he made Sunday in an interview with Associated Press Television 
News in which he said Iraq rejected continuation of the oil-for-food 
program. ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands 
lifting of sanctions, and this means the ouster of U.N. teams which 
supervise it'' he said in the interview Sunday. The program, which 
is an exception to trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 
invasion of Kuwait, allows the country to export limited amounts of 
oil to buy food and medicines for the 22 million Iraqis who have been 
hard hit by the sanctions. In his remarks to APTN Sunday, Saleh set 
no date for expelling the humanitarian workers, but complained that 
too little of the money from the sale of oil went to the Iraqi people 
and too much to administration. ``Iraq is bearing huge expenses which 
it pays to these (U.N.) personnel, and they do nothing apart from 
verifying that the imports have reached Iraqi ports,'' he said. On 
Monday, however, he said that the 400 U.N. workers supervising the 
program would remain in Iraq as long as the program continues. Iraq 
has taken a harder line toward the United Nations since four days 
of U.S. and British airstrikes aimed at punishing the Baghdad regime 
for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The bombardment 
ended Dec. 19. Baghdad's first response to the airstrikes was to ban 
the inspectors from returning to Iraq. On Saturday, Iraq said it would 
fire on U.S. and British warplanes patrolling skies over northern 
and southern Iraq. State-run Iraqi newspapers on Monday hailed the 
support the country received a day earlier from Arab legislators in 
Amman, Jordan. Delegations from 16 members of the Arab Parliamentary 
Union's 19 member states on Sunday condemned the airstrikes as ``unjust 
U.S.-British aggression'' and urged their governments to work toward 
lifting the U.N. sanctions on Iraq. Their recommendation, however, 
fell short of Iraq's demand that Arab countries begin circumventing 
the sanctions. Al-Jumhuriya daily called again Monday for such action, 
saying: ``Let's break the sanctions, relying on the will of the Arabs.'' 
In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he opposed the airstrikes 
but blamed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for provoking the attacks, 
a newspaper reported in early Monday editions. ``The ruling regime 
(in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems ... and Egypt naturally 
does not support this regime,'' Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak 
as saying. The U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait, cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons inspectors certify 
that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction. The sanctions _ 
which ban air travel to and from the country, limit oil sales and 
bar most other financial transactions _ have seriously damaged Iraq's 
economy. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called for 
a quick review of Iraq's weapons program as a condition for lifting 
sanctions and again warned the United States against using force. 
He told reporters after meeting with President Boris Yeltsin that 
Russia believes Iraq must cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors, 
but said the United Nations must swiftly complete a ``comprehensive 
review'' of Iraq's compliance.
