One of the American music forums you hear the least about is folk 
music. You don't hear much of it on the radio, and it is hard to find 
the albums in the stores. But, as VOA's Catherine Cole explains, in 
this look back at the year in folk music, there are plenty of fine 
new CDs to be found once you know who you are looking for. To review 
1998 in folk music we really need to look way back to the 1930s and 
'40s, when Woody Guthrie wrote songs like, "This Land is Your Land". 
He reinvented the American Folk Ballad as a vehicle for making social 
comments. His music later inspired many other singer/songwriters including 
Bob Dillon and Bruce Springstein. This year some of Woody Guthrie's 
unpublished material finally became songs thanks to the unlikely pairing 
of English punk folk rocker Billy Bragg and the rootsie rock band 
from the American mid-west Wilco. Listen to, "California Stars". "That 
is California Stars" from "Mermaid Avenue" a CD made up of newly discovered 
Woodie Guthrie lyrics set to some new music by the team of Billy Bragg 
and the band Wilco. Another teaming on the folk scene this past year 
is "Cry, Cry, Cry" a band made up of three rising folk stars, Dara 
Williams, Lucy Caplansky, and Richard Shindell. That's Richard Shindell 
and "Shades of Gray" off "Cry, Cry, Cry" the album he recorded with 
Dara Williams and Lucy Caplansky. In addition to that Robert Earl 
Keen tune, "Cry, Cry, Cry" features new folk arrangements of songs 
by Greg Brown and the rock band REM. 1998 will also be remembered 
as a good year for some old folk favorites, Bob Dillon teamed up with 
Jonie Mitchell and Van Morrison for a short tour of the American west 
coast. Their first show was met with such positive critical reviews 
that later dates proved to be among the summers most sought after 
tickets. Jonie Mitchell's album "Taming the Tiger" was also well received 
and has become one of her biggest sellers in years. In addition to 
12 new songs, this album also features art work by Jonie Mitchell 
herself. And Lucinda Williams fans finally had something to celebrate 
in 1998. After several years in the making, "Car Wheels on a Gravel 
Road" was finally released. It stands out in a year when record store 
shelves were filled with bands all looking for their place at the 
top with a catchy little tune that sounds just like the last number 
one song. I'm Catherine Cole.
