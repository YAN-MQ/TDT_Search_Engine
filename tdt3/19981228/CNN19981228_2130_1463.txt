like any other year, 1998 was better for some than others. and the 
world of entertainment certainly had its share of disappointments. 
jill brooke reports. as the year comes to an end, we'll let others 
look at its winners. this story is about the losers. it's a cruel 
cruel summer speaking of record lows, compared to 6 million, ace of 
base's newest album only sold 125,000 copies. and rocker rod stewart 
only sold 300,000 copies of his new record. in the magazine world, 
princess diana was really missed. last year, the great spike in magazine 
sales was after princess diana died. we've lost a great cover personality. 
nobody sold issues like princess diana. the tv networks lost almost 
10% of its audience. profits were sinking, and audiences were fleeing. 
few wanted an encore of "encore! encore!," "the secret diary of desmond 
pfeiffer" or magic johnson's talk show. after that, you're on your 
own. "the new york observer's" annual list of "who's mentioned the 
most in the media" found some surprising results. one person who fell 
the most on the list is mel gibson. he was 87 last year, he's down 
at the bottom, at 476. and this year, he had a movie out, "lethal 
weapon 4." whoa! universal pictures found itself in a financial pig 
sty. with a $14 million return, "babe: pig in the city" was a box 
office disappointment, as was the film, "meet joe black." hello, two 
people! and not enough filmgoers saw the virtue in seeing "holy man." 
box office returns -- $12 million. and oprah winfrey's film, despite 
a heavy promotional push, was not beloved enough by the audience. 
which brings us to another point -- many say the real losers this 
year were the critics and pundits. they panned the president, they 
panned the film, "waterboy." and they panned the play, "the scarlet 
pimpernel." and all were popular with the public, who made their own 
decisions about their likes and dislikes. even producers can't figure 
out these results. what happens to wonderful plays like "sideshow" 
and "triumph of love"? and they're very well-accepted by the critics, 
but the public didn't pick up on what the shows were about. it should 
be noted that the winners are often judged by sales. and quantity 
is not necessarily quality, because as one wise man said, "anyone 
who tries is a winner." jill brooke, "cnn entertainment news," new
