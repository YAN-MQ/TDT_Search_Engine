Yes, there are exceptions. ``Art,'' on Broadway, was written by a 
woman. ``Wit,'' off-off-Broadway, was written by a woman, as was ``Stop 
Kiss,'' which recently opened to enthusiastic reviews at the Joseph 
Papp Public Theater. And, last season, two female directors were honored 
with Tony awards _ Julie Taymor for ``The Lion King'' and Garry Hynes 
for ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' But in the eyes of Women's Project 
and Productions, a nonprofit theater dedicated to presenting plays 
by women, there is still a long way to go before female playwrights 
and directors reach parity with men in the theater. It is with this 
sense of inequity that Julia Miles founded the Women's Project 20 
years ago. This fall, the project acquired a 199-seat off-Broadway 
playhouse, Theater Four on West 55th Street, and produced its first 
play of the season there, ``The Knee Desires the Dirt'' by Julie Hebert. 
``We were very, very much looking for a home,'' Ms. Miles said. And 
this season the playwright Wendy Wasserstein joined the board of the 
Women's Project because, she said, there was still a need for a female-centered 
theater. ``If there was a season without women's plays, I don't know 
how many producers and critics would say, `Where were the women?''' 
Ms. Wasserstein said. ``Julia Miles will say that, and that's still 
important. Someone's got to look at a picture and say, `Why aren't 
there women in this picture?''' Ms. Miles has been asking that question 
since she started the Women's Project as an offshoot of the American 
Place Theater. ``I looked at our roster and, of about 72 plays that 
we had done, only about eight were written by women,'' Ms. Miles recalled. 
``I was shocked at this, that the thing I cared most about _ theater 
_ was really lacking in female voices.'' Since she began leading her 
theater group, Ms. Miles said, the situation has improved; 26 percent 
of the plays staged today are now written by women, up from 7 percent, 
she reported, and 20 percent are directed by women, up from 6 percent. 
The Women's Project, which became independent in 1987, has more than 
450 members, including Anne Bogart, Olympia Dukakis, Maria Irene Fornes, 
Joyce Carol Oates, Anna Deveare Smith and Paula Vogel. Among its better-known 
productions are ``A ... My Name Is Alice,'' directed by Joan Micklin 
Silver and Julianne Boyd; a musical version of Willa Cather's ``O 
Pioneers!'' by Darrah Cloud and Kim Sherman, and ``Abingdon Square'' 
by Ms. Fornes. Even though an increasing number of women are artistic 
directors of institutional theaters, Ms. Wasserstein said, they do 
not seem to feel a sense of mission about promoting the work of female 
playwrights. ``You don't have people who are committed to saying, 
`I will do more plays by women,''' Ms. Wasserstein said. The $1.5 
million purchase of the Women's Project's new theater, a former dye 
works from the 1800s that had been used as theater space for various 
productions, was made possible with a $1 million bank loan; a $500,000 
gift from Sallie Bingham, a board member, and another $500,000 from 
the board, foundations and the New York City Council. ``I do believe 
that women have a voice and it can be very, very different when they 
look at something,'' said Pat Schoenfeld, a former chairwoman of the 
project's board who continues to be an active member. ``And they need 
to be encouraged. They need to feel there is a place where they can 
feel comfortable developing their skills.'' In addition to producing 
three plays a season, the Women's Project runs a playwrights' lab 
in which writers read and critique one another's work, and a forum 
to develop directing skills. The project, which has an annual budget 
of $800,000 and a full-time staff of six, also conducts symposiums 
and after-play discussions. ``To put on a play, you need a whole community 
of people,'' Ms. Miles said. The Women's Project's season continues 
with ``The Chemistry of Change,'' by Marlane Meyer, which begins performances 
Feb. 10, and ``The Exact Center of the Universe,'' by Joan Vail Thorne, 
which starts March 23.
