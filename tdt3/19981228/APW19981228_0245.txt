A nuclear reactor was restarted at Ukraine's Yuzhnaya power plant 
following brief unscheduled repairs, officials said Monday. Reactor 
No. 3 was restarted Sunday after plant operators fixed the facility's 
cooling system. The reactor was shut down Saturday because of hydrogen 
leaks, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. The shutdown 
led to an electricity shortage and forced officials to delay repairs 
at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, where one reactor was to have 
been stopped Saturday. Ukraine's five nuclear power plants provide 
more than 40 percent of the former Soviet republic's energy needs. 
Three of the country's 14 reactors are currently undergoing repairs.
