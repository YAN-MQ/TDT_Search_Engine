NATIONAL FORECAST A complex weather pattern will evolve over the East 
on Tuesday, bringing snow to portions of the interior Northeast later 
Tuesday and Tuesday night. During the daytime, snow will accompany 
low pressure traversing the northern Great Lakes with over 6 inches 
of new snow likely in parts of Michigan's upper peninsula. Meanwhile, 
patches of lighter snow or rain will occur farther south over the 
southern Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley. A potent jet-stream disturbance 
crossing the Southeast will produce low pressure near the Middle Atlantic 
coast Tuesday afternoon. As the low strengthens, showers will develop 
from northern Florida to the eastern Carolinas. Isolated thunderstorms 
will also ignite over the region as the disturbance interacts with 
humid Atlantic air. By Tuesday night, the Middle Atlantic low will 
combine with the low crossing the Great Lakes, setting the stage for 
heavy snow Tuesday night and Wednesday across interior New England. 
Brisk winds from the northwest will direct bitterly cold air into 
the upper Mississippi Valley on Tuesday with dangerously low wind-chill 
values near the Canadian border. Farther south, dry and mild air will 
cover the southern Plains and Texas. A steady stream of Pacific moisture 
will bring heavy rain to the Northwest coast while intermittent lighter 
showers occur east of the Cascades. As the moist plume of air is further 
cooled upon intercepting the higher terrain, heavy snow will fall 
along the west-facing slopes of the northern Cascades and Bitterroots. 
Meanwhile, southern California will be sunny and warm. Focus: Squeezing 
the Wind High wind warnings were posted Monday for the Guadalupe Pass 
in the mountains of western Texas as steady winds of 40 mph with gusts 
in excess of 60 mph swept through the region. One driving force for 
the powerful winds was the circulation around an expansive and persistent 
high-pressure system centered over Nevada and Utah. Another important 
contributing factor was the lie of the land. Air coursing through 
mountain passes accelerates as its flow is constricted, much like 
toothpaste squirting from a tube that is squeezed too tightly.
