China's top state bank sharply cut interest rates Monday for deposits 
of British pounds and Hong Kong dollars and unified rates for four 
European currencies linked to the new euro, a bank official said. 
The one-year rate paid by the Bank of China for British pounds fell 
from 5.25 percent to 4.625 percent, while the rate for Hong Kong dollars 
fell from 5 percent to 4.375 percent, the official said. The reduction 
reflected lower global interest rates, the official told Dow Jones 
Newswires. Hong Kong banks cut lending and deposit rates by a quarter 
of a percentage point earlier this month. The rate for U.S. dollars 
was unchanged at 3.75 percent, compared with a rate of 3.78 percent 
for the Chinese currency, the yuan, said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. Rates for German marks, French and Belgian 
francs and Dutch guilders were unified at 2.1875 percent, compared 
with previous rates ranging from 1.5 to 2.625 percent, the official 
said. The bank did not explain the changes, but the official said 
they were linked to the Jan. 1 introduction of the euro, the new European 
Union currency. Britain, although part of the EU, is not participating 
in the launch of the euro. Some Chinese banks say they will offer 
euro accounts, and the currency exchange in Shanghai plans to introduce 
the euro later in 1999. Also Monday, China's central bank and the 
government's foreign exchange regulatory agency released an expected 
announcement formally authorizing trading in the euro.
