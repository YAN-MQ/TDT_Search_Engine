We're taking a break on News Now. It is Monday, December 28th 1998, 
the first work day of the last week - you know what I mean - before 
a new year. A couple of notable events in history on this date, it 
was on this date in 1945 that Congress adopted the formal Pledge of 
Allegiance To the Flag of the United States. It had originally been 
written in 1892, and so you certainly do hear that frequently in public 
assemblies and school starts and a lot of places every day. On this 
date in 1832, John C. Calhoun became the first US Vice President to 
resign from office. He quit after a dispute with President Andrew 
Jackson over what was called the Doctrine of Nullification. Now Mr. 
Calhoun was from the state of South Carolina and he was the leading 
advocate of nullification as a political philosophy asserting that 
when the legislature of a state believes that a federal law or regulation 
violated the constitution, that state could vote to ignore that law. 
The law in question at this point, in 1832, was a federal tariff on 
cotton. Now of course that was South Carolina's main agricultural 
export. So South Carolinians held a convention, and they voted to 
nullify that tariff and prohibit the federal government from collecting 
the money within the state's borders. President Andrew Jackson believed 
in a strong federal government, vice-president Calhoun believed the 
contrary and engineered a compromise that prevented violence. But 
then resigned from office. It is 11 hours Universal Time. From Washington
