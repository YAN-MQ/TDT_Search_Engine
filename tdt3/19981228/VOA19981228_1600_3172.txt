A new biography concludes with a new film about a biblical hero. Books 
on the Y2K millennium computer crisis are already starting to appear. 
And a beloved American writer inspires fresh tributes, not all of 
them welcome ones. VOA's Nancy Beardsley has Book Briefs. While the 
new animated film, "The Prince of Egypt" portrays the time-honored 
adventures of Moses. A new biography examines what's really known 
about the biblical leader's life and accomplishments. "Moses, a Life" 
was written by book columnist Jonathan Kirsch author of an earlier 
work about biblical stories called, "The Harlot by the Side of the 
Road". His research for that book convinced him that the man who led 
the Hebrew people out of slavery deserved a book of his own. Three 
major world religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all revere 
the figure of Moses. Now in many faiths he is essentially superseded 
-Jesus replaces Moses in Christianity, Mohammed replaces Moses in 
Islam. But he is still regarded as a great teacher, a great law giver 
and emancipator. Moses is also part of popular culture, says Jonathan 
Kirsch, thanks to classic movies like the "Ten Commandments". But 
he believes the biblical Moses, while capable of great wisdom and 
goodness, had another more complex side that is often been overlooked. 
We're taught that Moses is a symbol of freedom, but the Bible shows 
that Moses was capable of acting in a very stern and dictatorial way, 
and in fact was capable of terrible violence against people who opposed 
him within Israel, and people outside of Israel. And so there are 
troubling aspects of Moses as well. Jonathan Kirsch also examines 
the heated controversies surrounding Moses. Many believe he was the 
divinely inspired author of the first five books of the Bible. Others 
say, those books were written by a variety of authors. But Jonathan 
Kirsch believes what is most important about Moses is that he challenged 
human kind to make moral choices. And his challenge helps make the 
Bible a living document today.
