Mobs armed with sickles and swords on Monday battled each other and 
hurled gasoline bombs at houses and shops in an Indonesian provincial 
town. At least 22 people were injured and hundreds of residents fled 
their homes. In a separate incident, police on Sumatra island fired 
warning shots and plastic bullets at peasants who were arguing over 
cultivation rights with the owners of a state-owned farm. At least 
six people were injured in the clash in the northwestern town of Deli 
Serdang. Most were shot in the legs. The riots by sword-carrying mobs 
in the town of Poso on Sulawesi island were triggered by weekend brawls 
between rival gangs of youths. The unrest escalated partly into attacks 
by townspeople on the homes of migrants from the main island of Java. 
But the motive for much of the violence was unclear, with mobs attacking 
stores and houses at random. Rioters set afire as many as 20 buildings 
and threw stones at the bus station, a local resident, Hajj Fatma, 
said by telephone. ``The center of the town was blackened from the 
smoke billowing into the sky,'' Fatma said. She was preparing food 
for civilian guards who patrolled neighborhoods, fearing more violence. 
At least 100 families fled to a mountain outside Poso while others 
sought shelter with relatives. One witness said he saw eight truckloads 
of rioters drive into his neighborhood. ``I have to go because they're 
coming here,'' he said by telephone before hanging up. Police and 
soldiers were also deployed to protect government buildings and mosques 
and churches in Poso, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. 
Shops were closed and buses stayed off the streets. A nurse at the 
local hospital said by telephone that 22 people were injured, including 
one man whose neck had been cut by a sword. Other victims bled from 
head wounds after being hit by rocks. Indonesia has endured sporadic 
riots this year amid economic hardship and rising ethnic and religious 
tensions. Deadly riots in Jakarta helped force former President Suharto 
to quit in May after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
