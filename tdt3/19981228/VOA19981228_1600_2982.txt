While initial reports show US retail sales were good, but not as strong 
as expected, during the Christmas shopping season, with about 3.5 
% growth, however holiday sales on the computer Internet soared by 
more than 200 percent from last year. That figure helped push up the 
stocks of many retailers that sell on the Internet. Stock of a catalog 
retailer named Skymall jumped 300 percent and the active apparel company 
shares soared by 600 percent.
