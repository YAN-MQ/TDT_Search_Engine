A famous political name in Israel is mounting a challenge to prime 
minister benjamin Netanyahu. Benny begin, the son of former prime 
minister Menachem begin, announced today he's leaving Netanyahu's 
Likud party to run for prime minister. Begin is a staunch opponent 
of land-for-peace deals with the Palestinians. Israel's parliament 
voted last week to dissolve itself and hold early elections. The vote 
is expected to take place in late April.
