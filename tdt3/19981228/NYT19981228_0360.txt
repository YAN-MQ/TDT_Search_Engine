Nothing empties faster than a locker room on the day after a team's 
final game, and Monday, the Giants kept their routine, charging out 
of their Giants Stadium quarters and scattering to points from Fort 
Lauderdale to Fort Worth and from Fort Collins to Fort Thomas. The 
Giants' haste was also symbolic. This is not a season these Giants 
wish to dwell on, even if it ended with a 5-1 rush, including a four-game 
winning streak, to an 8-8 record. Although the Giants closed with 
a series of individual and team accomplishments, most of the players 
expressed a desire to use the season as a motivating example of what 
not to do next season. ``I'm extremely proud of everybody for hanging 
in there because it was rough for a while,'' defensive end Michael 
Strahan said. ``But I hope everybody remembers that it was rough. 
It's hard to win games. Things never just fall into place. We forgot 
that as a team this year. ``That may be what this year is good for, 
to remind us of what happens when we stand around waiting for something 
good to happen. It's not a very satisfying outcome.'' The youngest 
team in the National Football League for two consecutive years, the 
Giants seem eager to shed that title. ``We've got to grow up and mature,'' 
Coach Jim Fassel said. ``The older, veteran-type players are going 
to have to take a more dominant role. It's got to be a more seasoned 
team.'' Fassel also promised changes and stated the obvious, that 
his offense, which was ranked 29th in the league before Monday night's 
game between Pittsburgh and Jacksonville, had to improve. Fassel will 
be looking to improve a few areas, such as tight end, where the Giants 
will continue what has been a decadelong search for a pass-catching 
threat. It is likely they will also add another running back, either 
through free agency or the college draft. And the anticipated return 
of center Brian Williams should put in motion some other modifications 
on the line. At quarterback, Fassel did not name Kent Graham his starter 
for next year, saying he needed time to evaluate the entire season. 
But Fassel added that his reticence on the subject should not be misinterpreted. 
``Don't take that as a lack of confidence in Kent,'' Fassel said. 
``A lot of people think of Kent as a career backup. I don't happen 
to think that way. You can't evaluate on perceptions.'' On defense, 
Fassel and the Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, are digging 
in for potential upheaval brought on by free agency. The Giants hope 
to sign the unrestricted free agents Chad Bratzke, a defensive end, 
and Corey Widmer, the middle linebacker. Widmer's signing is anticipated 
since there have been meaningful negotiations. Bratzke and the Giants 
have not talked, and since Bratzke had a career-high 12{ sacks this 
year, it is possible he may attract an offer from another team that 
is too rich for the Giants, who have a number of other needs. The 
Giants would also like to keep safety Percy Ellsworth, who is a restricted 
free agent likely to attract attention, too. Without Ellsworth, the 
Giants have no veteran free safety should they want to replace Tito 
Wooten, who had a subpar season and who did not intercept a pass. 
Fassel, his coaches and the Giants' front office will sit down next 
week to make most of those decisions, though some decisions _ such 
as ignoring the free agency of guard Greg Bishop and the decision 
to send the third-string quarterback Mike Cherry to the N.F.L.'s World 
League _ have already been made. In the end, the Giants closed 1998 
happily, upsetting Denver in the middle of an undefeated December, 
but the final result _ a non-playoff year for a defending division 
champion _ was disillusioning. ``We got it turned around, which I'm 
really glad for,'' Fassel said. ``But we didn't do enough and that's 
always the bottom line.'' Strahan best described the mix of emotions 
most Giants were experiencing. ``I'll leave here today still feeling 
good about the last four games,'' he said. ``But I'm pretty sure when 
I get home and I'm watching the playoffs on television it's going 
to hit me _ hey, we should be there playing, too.''
