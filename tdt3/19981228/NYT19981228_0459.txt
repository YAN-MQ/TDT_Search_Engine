Forget New Year's Eve 1998. Just two days shy of another new year, 
almost everyone seems to be talking a lot more about where they'll 
be and what they'll be doing when the really interesting one rolls 
around. Fortunately, the people who brought you the spiffy new Times 
Square have been busy taking some of the hard work out of that epochal 
eve, at least when it comes to choosing the proper accessories. The 
bubbly should be Korbel. The video camera should be Panasonic. The 
credit card should be Discover. Get the idea? On Monday, at a news 
conference to herald a New Year's Eve that was 367 days away, corporate 
giants stood with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and claimed their ``official'' 
status in the Times Square 2000 celebration. Even the famous ball 
that drops from One Times Square is not immune. Giuliani announced 
that Waterford Crystal, the ``official crystal'' of the celebration, 
would design an elaborate new ball to replace the old aluminum one. 
The sponsors were chosen by the Times Square Business Improvement 
District and by Countdown Entertainment, a marketing company that 
represents the owners of One Times Square, from which the ball is 
dropped. The corporate money will help pay for the celebration on 
New Year's Eve 1999. Several sponsors refused to reveal Monday how 
much they paid for the honor, but said it was worth almost any price. 
Christopher McGillivary, president of Waterford Crystal USA, said 
the Times Square celebration would undoubtedly be one of the best 
advertising opportunities in history. ``The most special moment for 
the millennium is certainly going to be in New York City, and we wanted 
to be part of it,'' McGillivary said Monday. ``Not in a crass and 
commercial way, but in a very meaningful way.'' Korbel Champagne Cellars 
is taking its designation as the ``official champagne'' so seriously 
that early next year, it will unveil ``the world's largest champagne 
bottle'' and dispatch it on a nationwide tour that will end in midtown 
Manhattan on Dec. 31, 1999. It will stand 4 feet 6 inches high, weigh 
350 pounds and contain the sparkling wine. Whether the city's emergency 
services units will be needed to uncork it on that special night, 
when New York hopes to lead the world in greeting 2000, is unclear. 
Such details are not important when you're talking millennial big. 
To that effect, Giuliani also announced the creation of a millennium 
committee to plan the Times Square celebration and many others that 
will take place during 1999. The committee will solicit private donations 
to pay for the events outside Times Square, which Giuliani said would 
cost ``in the millions.'' The actor Ron Silver will head the committee, 
called NYC 2000. Members will include Cristyne Lategano, the mayor's 
communications director; Bruce Teitelbaum, his chief of staff, and 
Tamra Lhota, a fund-raiser for Giuliani during his 1997 campaign and 
the wife of Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota. Silver predicted Monday that 
the celebrations would ``set a tone and leave a legacy for the next 
100, even 1,000 years.'' Big wine bottles aside, the tone will not 
be tacky, organizers said Monday. ``A lot of companies have offered 
huge amounts of money to do something fancy,'' said Jeffrey Straus, 
president of Countdown Entertainment. ``But we said, `No way.' People 
have come to Times Square every New Year's Eve to watch a ball being 
lowered down, and that's what the celebration will be all about.'' 
Straus said the Home Shopping Network, the ``exclusive direct-response 
television retailer'' for the celebration, would sell a special line 
of dolls named ``Millennia.'' Doubletree Guest Suites, the ``official 
hotel,'' would provide suites for corporate sponsors on the big night. 
Korbel, Straus said, would change the labels on 16 million of its 
bottles, temporarily replacing its family crest with the Times Square 
2000 logo. ``Our sponsors understand that they are helping to make 
this event great,'' Straus said. ``They know that it's the event that 
comes first.''
