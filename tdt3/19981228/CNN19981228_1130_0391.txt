Analysts say China's government crackdown on political opposition 
is not expected to slow down anytime soon, and that could have an 
effect on its international relations. Robert Stern reports. In the 
past week, China has sentenced four dissidents to jail terms of ten 
years or more. Three were convicted for subverting state power by 
trying to Register an opposition political party. And in a closed 
trial Sunday, a labor activist was convicted of endangering state 
security by giving interviews to the U.S.-funded radio free Asia. 
The length of his trial -- 2 hours, 20 minutes. More such trials are 
expected, as China's communist party cracks down on any challenges 
to its monopoly on power. In two recent hardline speeches, Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin promised to nip in the bud any subversive activities, 
and warned that China would never tolerate western-style democracy. 
Behind the year-end crackdown, rising fears that China's slowing economy 
and growing numbers of laid-off workers could provide a pool of discontent 
for any nonparty organizations. And a number of sensitive anniversaries 
coming up next year, including the ten-year anniversary of the 1989 
Tiananmen square bloodshed. Such anniversaries have a history of focusing 
public anger. China has dismissed the torrent of international criticism 
of its summary trials and harsh sentences as interference in its internal 
affairs. But the current round of convictions comes after a year in 
which western governments, including the United States, have pointed 
to Chinese progress on human rights as proof their policy of engagement 
is working. With China's leaders making it clear the current crackdown 
will last well into 1999, the chill being felt among China's dissidents 
looks certain to spread to China's international relations. Robert 
Stern, CNN, Beijing.
