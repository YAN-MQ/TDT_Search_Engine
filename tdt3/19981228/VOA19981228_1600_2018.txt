Russian President Boris Yeltsin says the government has reached its 
goal of cutting 300,000 soldiers from the nation's military this year. 
Mr. Yeltsin met with Defense Minister Igor Surgeya on Monday to access 
the pace of military reform. While the President said that this year's 
goal of trimming the armed forces to 1.2 million soldiers had been 
met, he acknowledged that progress in other areas has been slow.
