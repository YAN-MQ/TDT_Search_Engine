The State Department said on Monday it hoped that the ``apparent surrender'' 
of two former Khmer Rouge to the Cambodian government would lead to 
some form of justice. A statement released by the department said 
the United States would work to try to ensure that there would be 
``accountability for Nuon Chea and Kheiu Samphan, as well as for the 
other, most senior, Khmer Rouge leaders.'' ``We trust that no actions 
will be taken by any party that could preclude achieving this goal,'' 
the statement said. Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia forswore vengeance 
against the two men Monday, saying he would welcome them at a meeting 
in his home on Tuesday. In April, only days before the death of Pol 
Pot, the senior leader of the Khmer Rouge, the United States began 
trying to plan to capture him and his associates. After his death, 
the United States asked the U.N. Security Council to set up a tribunal 
to try surviving Khmer Rouge leaders on charges of genocide. Last 
month, a panel appointed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan traveled 
to Cambodia to research how best to create such a tribunal. Its report 
is expected next month.
