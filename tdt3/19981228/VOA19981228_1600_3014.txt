This year most countries across Asia will register their worst economic 
performance since World War II. The economies are expected to shrink 
on average by 3.5 percent. But, as Amy Vickers explains, not every 
Asia Pacific economy is caught in recession. China, Taiwan and Australia 
are the exceptions, thriving in the midst of the financial turmoil, 
while their neighbors are suffering. This year China will grow an 
excess of 7 percent, Australia about 5 percent and Taiwan 4.7 percent. 
Hong Kong-based economist Enzio Van File says credit for these nations' 
enviable growth figures goes to their governments. What separates 
the winners from the losers clearly is policy cognizance. In otherwords, 
who actually is following the growth-friendliest policies in the region. 
What the losers have in common is a desire not to really embrace capitalism, 
and not really to embrace the whole concept of competition. In addition 
to Taiwan's commitment to free markets, Mr. Van File says the islands 
increasing trade surplus, a decline in inflation, and stable exchange 
rates have supported its strong performance. China's economic performance 
in 1998 is enviable compared to others in Asia. Wo Cong Wong managing 
director of Solomon Brothers, Hong Kong says government regulations 
are shielding its economy. I think if you look at what happened to 
China, during the Asia financial crisis, one very important difference 
is because the currency was not convertible. Financial markets are 
not really liberalized so what that would do to domestic savings, 
I think, is very important. Many other Asian countries, domestic savings 
wiped out, China has not. That's a very important factor. Analysts 
say sustained fiscal and monetary policies in Australia helped it 
achieve an excellent economic performance in 1998. These include a 
reduction in the public debt, a rise in budget surplus, and interest 
rate consistently in line with the two or three percent inflation 
target. But Australian, like China and Taiwan, will experience a slowdown 
next year due to external events. Still analysts say, prudent economic 
policies have put them on track to perform relatively well through 
the turn of the century. Amy Vickers for VOA News, Hong Kong.
