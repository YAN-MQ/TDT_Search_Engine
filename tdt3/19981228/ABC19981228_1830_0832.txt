Tonight we're going to take "A closer look" at the shopping revolution. 
It was a huge Christmas for the Internet with millions of Americans 
moving from retailing to E-tailing as the insiders call it. Online 
sales more than tripled from last year to about $13 billion. But there 
were plenty of problems. Barnes & Noble.com and the auction site ground 
to a near halt. Amazon.com was overwhelmed by orders. ABC's Gina Smith 
reports in the E-tailing revolution, there are more than a Few risks 
and rip-offs. Larry Morse bought a computer on the Internet. He paid 
$1,400. He thought it was a steal, and in a way, he was right. I sent 
the money, nothing happened. And nothing happened, and nothing happened. 
And pretty soon I got panicky and tried to contact him, but by then, 
he was gone. Christina platthey paid more than $1,000 for the extremely 
rare beanie baby the "wingless quacker." It was a fake Beanie baby, 
a quacker with half of its wings chopped off. Now that Internet shopping 
has grown to be a $1 billion business, it is attracting its share 
of hustlers ready to take your money and run. When people come to 
a new marketplace, scam artists follow. Rip-offs aren't the only problem. 
Bad service, faulty billing and web stores that can't keep up with 
consumer demand are giving the industry a black eye. Bob Fraser helps 
companies set up their online shops. To capture the market is causing 
people to go online early and to not do everything necessary to ensure 
a good experience. That means making products easy to find, delivering 
them on time and in good shape, and not forcing customers to Wade 
through endless screens. Many sites do seem slow or missing altogether. 
Toys "R" us recently had to close its site for hours after its computers 
crumbled under a consumer crush. Now there's a smarter way to do holiday 
shopping. As the commercials keep pointing out, Internet shopping 
can be convenient, but only if you buy from a reputable firm and use 
a credit card so you can cancel any inaccurate charges later. Gina 
Smith, ABC News, New York.
