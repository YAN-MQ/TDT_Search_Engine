With both sides now respecting a cease-fire, U.N. officials tried 
Monday to help civilians who fled four days of fighting between Serbs 
and ethnic Albanians in northern Kosovo which left at least 15 people 
dead. Thousands more fled into snow-covered hills to escape the fighting, 
according to U.N. and ethnic Albanian sources. No clashes were reported 
Monday in the Serbian province, according to a spokesman for the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Jorgen Grunnet. Grunnet said 
both sides were generally respecting a truce negotiated Sunday by 
the American head of the OSCE peace verification force, William Walker, 
which ended clashes around Podujevo, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) 
north of here. The fighting put new strains on an already fragile 
peace accord reached Oct. 12 between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, which ended seven months of fighting. 
In neighboring Albania, the country's parliament called Monday for 
NATO to intervene in Kosovo, saying that was the only way to prevent 
a humanitarian disaster and open the way to a ``political solution.'' 
And the province's leading ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, 
described the situation as ``very difficult and dangerous.'' He urged 
the United States and European powers to step up diplomatic efforts 
toward a lasting political settlement and prevent ``ethnic cleansing'' 
by Serb forces. The Kosovo Information Center, run by Rugova's party, 
claimed 15,000 people had been displaced by the fighting, which erupted 
Christmas Eve when government forces attacked strongholds of ethnic 
Albanian rebels searching for the killers of a Serb policeman. A spokeswoman 
for the U.N. refugee agency, Maki Shinohara, estimated the number 
of displaced people at about 5,000 and said humanitarian workers were 
trying to locate them to provide food, blankets and other supplies. 
Shinohara said teams from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
had found three villages around Podujevo empty except for fighters 
from the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``So far the operations are normal,'' 
she said. ``We're sending our convoys into other areas that we could 
reach ... We're not being too optimistic but we do hope the situation 
will stabilize.'' She said last week's fighting was ``definitely ... 
a setback'' to efforts to restore peace to the province, where ethnic 
Albanian rebels are battling for independence from Serbia, the main 
republic of Yugoslavia. The ethnic Albanian media center said the 
death toll from the four days of fighting rose Monday to 15 with the 
death of a wounded KLA fighter and the discovery of a civilian's body 
west of Podujevo. Despite the violence, Walker, head of the OSCE's 
Kosovo Verification Mission, sought to dispel fears that the province 
was on the brink of fullscale war. He called the fighting ``sporadic'' 
and said both sides ``are being relatively cautious.'' In Moscow, 
Russian Foreign Minister Ignor Ivanov blamed the ethnic Albanians 
for provoking the violence to derail negotiations on the province's 
longterm future. ``The blame lies with those who provoked these conflicts 
_ first of all the Kosovo Albanians, or, to be more exact, extremists 
and separatists,'' Ivanov said during a news briefing, according to 
the Interfax news agency. Russia has long sided with Serbs in the 
conflict in the predominantly Albanian province. Despite the Oct. 
12 agreement, which averted the threat of NATO airstrikes, neither 
side has shown a willingness to back off from widely differing goals 
for the province. The KLA insists on independence, while the Serbian 
government says it will never let Kosovo go. ``There is no hand in 
Serbia which would sign secession or displacement of Kosovo from Serbia's 
constitutional order,'' Serbian Vice Premier Milovan Bojic was quoted 
Monday by the government's Tanjug news agency. More than 1,000 people 
have been killed since Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels 
in February, and about 300,000 have been driven from their homes.
