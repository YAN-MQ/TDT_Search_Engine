Facing mounting human losses, Israeli-backed militiamen on Monday 
abandoned an area near the southern mountain town of Jezzine which 
had been a frequent target of Lebanese guerrilla fire, officials said. 
The retreat was for military reasons, said officials of the Israeli-backed 
South Lebanon Army , speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
They did not elaborate. The SLA, a 2,500-man local force armed and 
paid by Israel, has since July lost more than a dozen men to ambushes 
and roadside bombs planted by guerrillas near Jezzine, about 20 kilometers 
(12 miles) north of the Israeli border. Lebanese security officials 
said the SLA pulled back Monday from two outposts near the previous 
front line at Kfar Falous, east of this southern provincial capital. 
The SLA pullback came amid renewed talks in Jerusalem of an Israeli 
withdrawal from Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. The talks were 
resumed after Lebanese guerrilla rockets injured 13 Israeli civilians 
in northern Israel last week in retaliation for an Israeli air raid 
in eastern Lebanon that killed a Lebanese mother and her six children. 
Lebanese guerrillas are leading a battle to oust the SLA and about 
1,500 Israeli soldiers from a border area of southern Lebanon that 
Israel occupies. Israeli troops have no positions in Jezzine, the 
northernmost mountain area jutting from the enclave. However, the 
Israeli military provides the SLA in Jezzine with the crucial firepower 
to maintain its control over the area.
