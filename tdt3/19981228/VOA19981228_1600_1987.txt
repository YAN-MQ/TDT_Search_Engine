An uneasy peace has taken hold in Serbia's Kosovo province, after 
several days of fighting between government forces and ethnic Albanian 
separatists. The Chief of the International Monitors, verifying compliance 
with the peace efforts says neither side has used its full fire power.

the monitors, questions whether they can continue to do their work 
without cooperation from both sides.
