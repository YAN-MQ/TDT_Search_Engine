The Iraqi News Agency says its anti-aircraft defenses have shot down 
what it called an enemy airplane. However, here in Washington US Defense 
Department officials are strongly denying that any plane was shot 
down by Iraq. Earlier US warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over 
Northern Iraq fired missiles at an Iraqi anti-aircraft sight. VOA 
Pentagon Correspondent Jim Randall has more. US officials say the 
planes fired missiles that homed in on Iraqi radar facilities and 
followed up with precision guided bombs. US experts are evaluating 
pictures from the planes to assess the damage. The planes returned 
unharmed. News reports from Baghdad say 4 Iraqi soldiers died and 
seven were hurt in the exchange of missiles. US and British warplanes 
patrol large parts of Iraq enforcing a UN resolution that bans Baghdad's 
attacks on southern Shiite Muslims and northern Kurds. The two no-fly 
zones covered more than half of Iraq's territory. US officials say 
pilots are permitted to defend themselves if they are threatened by 
missiles, gunfire, or certain kinds of radar. Jim Randall, VOA News 
at the Pentagon.
