I'm Bill Hazard, VOA News. The Arab Parliamentary Union has strongly 
condemned the US and British airstrikes against Iraq. The resolution 
adopted Sunday, after a one day meeting in Amman, Jordan by legislators 
from 19 Arab nations, calls for a united response to the attacks. 
It also demands compensation for the Iraqi people and urges Arab governments 
to work to lift sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War. The 
Union also issued a statement referring to the attacks against Iraq 
as unjust US and British Aggression.
