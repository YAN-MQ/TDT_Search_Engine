The smallest of the chukwu octuplets died yesterday morning, just 
a week after birth. Greg Lamotte has the story. Saturday night, the 
parents of the world's first surviving set of octuplets visited all 
eight babies for the first time, but hours later, eight became seven, 
when the smallest child died from heart and lung complications. Chijindu 
chidera udobi weighed only 10.3 ounces when she was born December 
20th. She was delivered via C-section along with six other siblings, 
the first of the eight children was born vaginally December 8th. The 
mother has been in the hospital ever since. In a statement released 
through the hospital, the parents, who are nigerian-born, but are 
American citizens, said, members of the parents catholic church spoke 
out. My heart goes out to them, and I will pray and fast for them 
for God to bless them and let them live. Every child counts, and every 
child is different in his or her own way. So we pray that the rest 
of the seven live and stay with us. The mother was offered a reduction 
procedure when it was learned she was carrying eight fetuses, but 
she declined citing religious and personal reasons. Doctors say four 
of the babies are breathing on their own. The others remain on ventilators, 
including the youngest who was operated on Saturday for a perforated 
intestine. All of the babies are in critical, but stable condition. 
The earliest the babies will go home is late February. The mother 
is expected to leave the hospital early this week. Greg LaMotte, CNN,
