big stories in tomorrow morning's papers. Let's take a look, beginning 
with "U.S.A. today." What are the worst flights in America? Listen 
up. The most crowded air travel routes to avoid. Here they are, Dallas 
to Orlando, Dallas to Tampa, and Chicago to Las vegas. NBA players 
threaten to form their own league. Come on. "U.S.A. today" reporting 
NBA players are preparing to go it alone, form their own basketball 
league. As you may know, the whole season may be canceled by next

tribune" -- five coaches fired on black Monday in less than the last 
24 hours. Ray Rhodes, Philadelphia, Dom capers Carolina, Ted marchibroda, 
Baltimore, dennis eriksson, Seattle and Dave wannstedt, Chicago. The 
bears are without a coach. "Atlanta constitution," this is a tree 
that is visible in at least one well-made documentary about the Rockefeller 
family. John D. Rockefeller Jr. sat beneath a 300-year-old true back 
when he was planting something that became known as colonial Williamsburg. 
The tree is gone, a casualty of the ice storm that has hit Virginia 
so hard.
