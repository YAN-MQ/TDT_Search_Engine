The jail sentence imposed on Tehran's former mayor was put on hold 
after his lawyer filed an appeal to the prosecutor general, state-run 
Iranian radio reported Monday. A statement from the prosecutor general's 
office said that Gholamhossein Karbaschi will not be sent to prison 
before further investigation of the case, the radio said. ``A request 
was put to the office of the state prosecutor general by Karbaschi's 
lawyer requesting the office to review the case,'' the radio said. 
His lawyer is Bahman Keshavarz. Karbaschi was convicted in July of 
corruption charges and sentenced to five years in prison. On Thursday, 
an appeals court reduced the prison sentence to two years. It also 
reduced to 10 years from 20 years the period Karbaschi is banned from 
holding public office. And it replaced his sentence of 60 lashes with 
a fine of dlrs 3,000. This would be in addition to earlier orders 
to pay dlrs 330,000 as punishment and dlrs 200,000 to reimburse the 
city for money he allegedly embezzled. Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate 
President Mohammad Khatami, had been a target of hard-line political 
rivals, and many Iranians saw the trial as a political settling of 
scores. The judiciary in Iran is controlled by hard-liners. Karbaschi 
was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his eight years as 
Tehran's mayor. During his trial, which lasted more than a month, 
Karbaschi admitted to making mistakes but denied stealing public money. 
Karbaschi won wide respect for his work as mayor, mainly for city 
improvements he implemented. But he also made enemies among the merchant 
class, who were upset by new taxes, and hard-liners, who were angered 
at his pro-Khatami stance. Riots erupted in Iran soon after Karbaschi's 
arrest in April. For many Iranians, the televised trial gave the first 
insight into Iran's judicial process and moderates saw it more as 
an indictment of the judiciary than the mayor.
