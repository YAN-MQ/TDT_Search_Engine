A brief review of the top story. For the first time since the latest 
confrontation between the U.S. and iraq, the Iraqis fired missiles 
at U.S. warplanes today. It happened in the northern no-fly zone. 
U.S. planes responded firing at an Iraqi missile battery. The Iraqis 
say they probably downed a western plane. The Pentagon deny ies that 
claim.
