The Chief of the National Basketball Association Players Union is 
calling for labor negotiations to resume this week. Billy Hunter says 
he wants to meet with League Commissioner David Stern in New York 
with only one of two additional representatives from each side present. 
No talks have been held since Wednesday, when Stern and Hunter met 
in private in Las Angeles. The opposing sides are fighting over the 
distribution of about $2 billion in annual revenue. They need to reach 
an agreement by early January to salvage a 45 -50 game regular season. 
The League has scheduled a Board of Governors Meeting for January 
7th where Stern is expected to recommend scrapping the rest of the 
season. Nearly 400 regular season games have been lost so far, and 
NBA players are beginning to lose valuable product endorsement money 
in addition to millions of dollars in salaries.
