Bad weather is being blamed for the sinking of the already downed 
hot air balloon about a mile down now in the bottom of the sea in 
the waters off hawaii. Steve Fossett, Richard Branson were halfway 
to their goal of sailing around the world. The crew made it back in 
one piece. The balloon didn't. It probably will never be recovered. 
This morning Matt Lauer spoke with Steve Fossett and Richard Branson 
who joined him by phone. Matt started out by asking Fossett whether 
or not he was disappointed. My last two attempts, this attempt and 
my attempt in August, I actually believed I was going to make it around 
the world. So those were disappointments and I felt I didn't have 
quite as good luck as I would like. Richard, do you ever feel you're 
snake-bit? This is your fourth attempt. Do you feel as if you're getting 
closer? Do you feel as if this record is not meant to be broken? I 
think as Steve said we were within 2 1/2 days timewise of going around 
the world. We were going to go across America on Christmas day. We 
had 1 1/2 more days to go across the atlantic. We know we have the 
technology craft. We know we have the balloon -- it was working brilliantly. 
So we're very, very nearly there, I think. Matt Lauer talking with 
Richard Branson and Steve Fossett this morning on "Today" on NBC.
