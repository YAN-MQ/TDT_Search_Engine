In ``The Last Dinosaur Book,'' the scholar W.J.T. Mitchell solemnly 
suggests that Steven Spielberg's ``Jurassic Park'' does for the dinosaur 
what Spenser's ``Faerie Queene'' did for the dragon. He adds that 
the movie's ending _ in which the human characters manage to escape 
when their pursuers, a pair of voracious female velociraptors, are 
attacked by a huge Tyrannosaurus rex _ expresses ``a nostalgia for 
the days of big patriarchal capital, before the arrival of career 
women and `clever girls' in multinational corporations.'' As Mitchell 
sees it, the T. rex symbolizes ``the good old days of `feudal' capitalism, 
when companies were identified with individual `giants' (like Spielberg 
himself) who were capable of great evil and great good,'' while the 
raptors ``represent the new stage of post-modern capitalism, of `downsizing,' 
flexibility, rapid strike forces, teamwork, adaptability, steep learning 
curves, and (not incidentally) gender confusion.'' Were such observations 
delivered with any wit or tongue-in-cheek humor, ``Last Dinosaur'' 
might well make for entertaining reading. As it stands, however, the 
book is a lumbering, dinosaurian tome that takes a potentially engaging 
subject, our current fascination with dinosaurs and the cultural reasons 
behind it, and turns it into an absurdly pretentious treatise, gussied 
up with all the latest Marxist, feminist and structuralist allusions. 
Although Mitchell has assembled an impressive archive of dinosaur 
images _ from Barney to the dinosaur skeleton in the Cary Grant movie 
``Bringing up Baby,'' from the Sinclair gas logo to the logo of the 
Toronto Raptors basketball team _ he does little to shed light on 
what these images might mean. The main problem with this copiously 
illustrated book is that Mitchell, a professor in the departments 
of English and art history at the University of Chicago, sees dinosaurs 
not merely as ``an infinitely flexible cultural symbol,'' but as ``a 
kind of blank slate on which every kind of collective and individual 
fantasy can be projected.'' In other words, dinosaurs can mean anything 
and everything. They are ``us'' and ``not-us,'' Mitchell writes: ``As 
erect bipeds, they resemble us; as reptiles, they are the `other,' 
the exotic, strange, sinister alien, loaded down with satanic associations, 
from the serpent who tempts Eve to the Great Red Dragon of the Apocalypse.'' 
On one hand, dinosaurs ``can symbolize the dominant `master race' 
that commands a global empire''; on the other hand, they can symbolize 
``the vanished, savage races that lost out in the Darwinian struggle, 
or an invading horde of aliens who threaten white supremacy.'' They 
can be figures of ``obsolescence and failure to adapt,'' or in the 
case of Godzilla, symbols of ``novelty and sometimes runaway innovation.'' 
``The dinosaur is a prestige symbol for modern nation-states,'' Mitchell 
asserts, ``and a model for ideologies of world conquest and domination. 
It is associated with childhood, old age and everything in between. 
It is associated with sexual differentiation and reproduction, and 
with the failure to reproduce. It is a figure of everything alien 
to human nature (cold-blooded, reptilian, rapacious) and of all that 
is most familiar in human nature (coldblooded, reptilian, rapacious).'' 
To the Victorians, Mitchell contends, the dinosaur was a fitting symbol 
of ``the world's largest empire at the peak of its glory and self-confidence.'' 
The Crystal Palace exhibition of 1854, fittingly enough, included 
the very first dinosaur reproductions made for the public: huge, life-size 
leviathans that ``reflected the best scientific knowledge of the time'' 
but that look, in retrospect, like reptilian hippos or the offspring 
of a buffalo and an iguana. To Americans of the gilded age, however, 
the dinosaur's aura was best captured, Mitchell argues, by Charles 
Knight's famous paintings, which depicted heavily armored behemoths 
in one-on-one combat: ``the paleontological equivalent of that other 
war of giants, the struggles among the `robber barons' in late 19th-century 
America.'' This period, he goes on, ``so often portrayed as the era 
of `social Darwinisn,' economic `survival of the fittest,' ruthless 
competition, and the formation of giant corporate entities headed 
by gigantic individuals is aptly summarized by the Darwinian icon 
of giant reptiles in a fight to the death.'' Although such arguments 
make sense in a late-night college bull session sort of way, they 
are undermined by Mitchell's repetitious and highly disorganized narrative, 
his passion for pompous and unhelpful digressions (about everything 
from Jeffersonian democracy to modernist art), and his tendency to 
push his observations past the bounds of common sense. Indeed, ``Last 
Dinosaur'' is peppered with specious remarks. In one chapter Mitchell 
writes: ``When Foucault wondered what would take the place of the 
Age of Man he probably didn't suspect that it would be the Age of 
the Dinosaur.'' And in another: ``If the dinosaur is an ancestral 
figure at the level of community or nation, it is the Oedipal father 
in the private sphere.'' Some of Mitchell's remarks are pedantic statements 
of the obvious: ``A cubist dinosaur would not be of much use, either 
to a paleontologist or to the public.'' Some are predicated upon dubious 
findings: ``The fortunes of dino-science seem to flourish in inverse 
relation to dinomania: when the scientific side is depressed, the 
popular image seems to become even more inflated and prolific.'' And 
others are just plain comical. Wondering why dinosaurs in the modern 
period (1900-1960) were usually depicted as green, Mitchell asks, 
``Is it a symbol of the `colored' racial other, the savage, primitive 
denizen of the green world? Or is it an emblem of the white man's 
burden, the color of the military camouflage required for the Great 
White Hunter to blend in with the jungle and thus to dominate it?'' 
Such passages do not add to our understanding of dinosaurs as a cultural 
icon. They instead read like a parody of current academic scholarship: 
lots of sound and fury, signifying nothing. PUBLICATION NOTES: `THE
