It could be midweek before residents in several southern states have 
their power restored. An ice storm crippled parts of the region leaving 
many in Tennessee, virginia, Louisiana and Mississippi without electricity.

power for several more days. An electrical worker died while trying 
to restore power. Authorities say he came in contact with a live wire.
