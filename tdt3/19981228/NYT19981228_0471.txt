Bill Bradley retired from the Senate in 1996. Since then he has taught, 
done television commentary and given, by his count, 140 speeches. 
Carrying his own luggage for the first time in 18 years, the man who 
survived a career as a professional basketball player without serious 
shoulder complaints developed problems with his rotator cuff from 
lugging a 50-pound suitcase around airports. It was, apparently, the 
weight of the books that was dragging him down. (``You always take 
10 times more than you can read.'') Certainly it was not the wardrobe. 
``You'd be surprised how superfluous it is to change your shirt,'' 
he confided. Now Bradley is back in harness, running for the Democratic 
presidential nomination, encumbered with scheduler, media handler, 
chauffeur. This campaign is still a low-rent operation, the car a 
1988 Lincoln with a balky back door, and his public appearances running 
to labor union Christmas parties and grade-school awards days. There 
is about $20 million standing between Bradley and serious credibility 
as a candidate. Given his commitment to campaign finance reform, he 
is hoping to get it from 20,000 donors giving $1,000 each. He says 
he is working on it. Bradley's decision to run for the presidency 
seems like a reasonable political calculation even though Vice President 
Gore is far and away the front-runner. About a year from now, according 
to Democratic contrarians, many primary voters may wake up to the 
near-inevitability of Gore's presidential nomination and suffer a 
case of anticipatory buyer's remorse. Given the present level of public 
cynicism about politics, the malady will probably be as profound as 
it is premature, its chief symptom being a desperate flailing around 
for somebody who seems better, or at least different. It is the Bruce 
Babbitt/Paul Tsongas role, and it has always been short-term employment. 
(Buyer's remorse is usually followed by grudging submission.) But 
politics these days has a tendency to veer off the trail at a moment's 
notice. Gore could run into new and politically fatal problems over 
his next year in office. Or he could be kidnapped by space aliens. 
This is where Bradley would come in. He is popular with the media, 
which counts for something. (``True Confessions: We Love the Big Lug,'' 
wrote William Powers recently in the National Journal.) He has a serious 
campaign agenda, centering on underprivileged children and racial 
unity. He is a deep thinker, the author of four books, which is more 
than enough in the Senate to earn a reputation for substance. But 
it is impossible to exaggerate how much his legitimacy as a national 
politician rests on the fact that he used to make his living stuffing 
a large round ball through a netted hoop. ``Do you know who Bradley 
is?'' asks a teacher at Berringer High School in Newark, N.J., where 
the ex-senator has come to help publicize a student volunteerism program 
called Do Something. ``He was a basketball player for the Knicks,'' 
says Charles Estrada, a small, talkative boy in a wrestling team sweatshirt. 
``Anything else?'' ``No,'' says Charles, searching his memory. ``And 
_ and he's running for president.'' The school's principal, who has 
dropped by to give the program a sendoff speech, launches into a description 
of how when he was a Rutgers college student, he watched Bradley play 
for Princeton: ``This man used to throw 40-footers into the basket, 
and Rutgers could never win.'' Bradley tells the students: ``The older 
you are, the better basketball player you were.'' He does not try 
to downplay the association _ his most recent book is not the basic 
dutiful candidate's tome on how to make government better, but a best 
seller about how sports teaches character. However, he does not have 
to push it, either. His status as a former New York Knick comes up 
absolutely all the time, and even when it does not, it is there. At 
Berringer, the students around the room each offer an adjective to 
describe themselves. ``I'm Crystal and I'm charismatic,'' says the 
student body president. ``I'm Luis and I'm shy,'' says the Do Something 
leader. It seems almost inevitable that Bradley, when his turn comes, 
will say, ``I'm Bill and I'm tall.'' But instead he offers, ``I'm 
Bill Bradley and I'm thankful to be here,'' and urges the students 
to come back with anecdotes about their efforts. ``I'll tell the stories 
of Do Something and Berringer High School all over the country,'' 
he promises before the group breaks up and the kids stand in line 
for his autograph. Bradley, whose candidacy is still officially in 
the ``exploratory'' stage, is likely to share the field of would-be 
Gore-busters with a few other Democrats, including Senators Paul Wellstone 
of Minnesota and John Kerry of Massachusetts. Wellstone is a favorite 
of the left, and Kerry is a combat veteran with access to his wife's 
personal fortune. But as everybody knows, Bradley has the best shot.
