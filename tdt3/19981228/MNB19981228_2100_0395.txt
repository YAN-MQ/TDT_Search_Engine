As we just saw this very same president who today oked today's air 
strike is prepared for what could be called the political battle his 
life. This will take place in the Senate where any number of things 
could happen as Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial nears now. We start 
off tonight with the story from NBC news White House correspondent 
claire Shipman. The president focused his public attention today on 
Iraq and the year 2000 computer problem. But his legal team, after 
cutting their holidays short, spent the day looking for any hints 
from Capitol Hill about how the Senate will proceed when it returns 
next week. The leading option being discussed -- a streamlined trial 
which could open after preliminaries next week on January 11. No witnesses, 
short presentations, and then a vote which would presumably acquit 
the president and then a vote on a censure resolution. The goal -- 
to wrap everything up before the state of the union address on january 
19. But there are pitfalls. The president's legal team wants assurances 
there will be no surprise evidence or witnesses. Likewise, republicans 
would want to know the president would accept censure. The toughest 
part -- the language in a censure resolution. Will the president admit 
he lied? Will republicans insist on that? As one advisor said tonight, 
there will have to be considerably more good will in this phase of 
the process to avoid a damaging Senate trial.
