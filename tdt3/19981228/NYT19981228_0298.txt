If every little millimeter counts in the height of your children, 
a spring or fall birth might give them an edge. European researchers 
do not know why but those babies are longer and by age 18 taller than 
other children. ``A difference of 2 millimeters does not seem a lot 
and surely one should not try to plan a `long' baby based on seasonality 
of conception,'' said Dr. Mads Melbye of the Danish Epidemiology Center 
who studied the birth records of more than 1 million Danish children 
born between 1973 and 1994. ``What was striking to us was the consistency 
we observed in the seasonal variation.'' In a research letter in the 
current Lancet, the investigators concluded, ``The seasonal pattern 
at birth was similar across the strata of birth year, birth order, 
sex and gestational age, which supports the hypothesis that month 
of birth is important for adult stature.'' The study was inspired 
by Austrian research, reported in the journal Nature last February, 
which showed ``clear evidence for a dependence of final body height 
at age 18 on birth month.'' Melbye and his colleagues expanded upon 
the earlier study not to grow basketball players or jockeys but because 
of ongoing research exploring the link between fetal size and health 
problems in later life. Neither study could definitively explain the 
link between height and birth month, but the Austrian researchers 
suggested it could be related to annual rhythms and sunshine. Melbye 
said that he would like to see similar studies done in the Southern 
Hemisphere. ``We have at present no explanation for these findings,'' 
he added, ``other than that an external factor which is seasonally 
determined must influence the growth of a baby.'' _ NANCY BETH JACKSON 
For Athletes, Better Focus With Hypnosis Moments before the gun sounded 
to start his World Cup 400-meter race, Iwan Thomas gently tugged on 
his left ear lobe. This subtle movement helped him block out the noise 
of the crowd and the runners on either side of him. Like a number 
of other top athletes, Thomas has been using hypnosis to enhance his 
performance. The action of pulling his ear lobe is known as an associative 
posthypnotic command, which brought him into a heightened state of 
concentration. He won the race that day, capping his best season ever. 
Thomas, 24, of Wales, described how he came to work with a hypnotist: 
``I met Robert Farago in 1995 when the BBC was looking for a guinea 
pig for one of their morning breakfast programs. Then last year things 
weren't going well for me, and my parents said `Why don't you give 
that hypnotist a try?' I think it helped to keep me calm and focused.'' 
Professional athletes and their weekend counterparts are turning to 
hypnosis to help correct everything from a poor golf swing to precompetition 
jitters. Dr. Dwight Damon, president of the National Guild of Hypnotists 
in Merrimeck, N.H., said he believed more and more of the guild's 
7,000 members are using hypnosis to help athletes improve performance. 
``What hypnosis does is it takes the champion's best performance, 
makes it available 100 percent of the time,'' said Farago, who works 
with athletes at his hypnosis clinic in Windsor, England. ``Sports 
people know it as going `into the zone.''' Farago works this way: 
He takes out a pocket watch and asks the subject to focus on it as 
he swings it to and fro, which results in a trance. For the next hour, 
Farago commands the required change, either something specific like 
``You will hit the ball straight down the fairway'' or more general 
as in ``You will win!'' These commands might be tied to a gesture 
like tugging on the ear lobe. Bob Reese, former head trainer for the 
New York Jets, also uses hypnotherapy with both professional and recreational 
athletes. He said he believed that the only drawback of the practice 
was its image problem. ``One of the things I learned early on about 
hypnosis is to quit calling it that,'' said Reese, who runs a company 
called Train Your Brain, in North Port, N.Y., and charges between 
$65 and $150 a session. ``There was a built-in fear _ they didn't 
want to give up their minds. Instead, I started telling athletes we 
were going to do some high-powered visualization techniques.'' _ PAUL
