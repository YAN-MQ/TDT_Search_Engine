No gurgling, maybe just a little cooing going on in love letters that 
have surfaced in Scotland. The letters were exchanged between Queen 
Victoria and her paramour/servant John Brown. According to a British 
newspaper, a stash of letters and photographs of the odd couple was

friend J.B. from his best friend, V.R. Clearly, they say, the two 
were very, very close.
