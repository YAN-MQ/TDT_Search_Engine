The arcane language of physics is not exactly the stuff of song lyrics, 
but the Cernettes, billed as the world's first particle physics rock 
band, have hit the Internet. Even if nonphysicists fail to get their 
musical jokes, the Cernettes count on a growing audience of admiring 
scientists. The Cernettes take their name from CERN, the acronym for 
Europe's pre-eminent high-energy particle laboratory straddling the 
French-Swiss border near Geneva, with which all the singers are associated. 
Membership in the four-woman amateur singing group and its band changes 
from year to year, but the Cernettes' songwriter-lyricist, Silvano 
De Genarro, constantly provides material to keep his group up to par 
at the many physics meetings and celebrations where they perform. 
On the job at CERN, De Genarro, a computer scientist, uses virtual 
reality to manipulate the virtual counterparts of battleship-size 
particle detectors that must fit into cramped niches in the laboratory's 
17-mile circular accelerator tunnel. But in his spare time he writes 
songs of the doo-wop style popular in the 1950s and '60s. ``The average 
physicist around here was growing up in those years,'' De Genarro 
said in an interview, ``and they get a nostalgic kick out of my tunes.'' 
Some of his songs involve the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, nearing 
completion in CERN's circular accelerator tunnel spanning the border 
between Switzerland and France near Geneva. Here is a typical verse 
from De Genarro's lament ``Collider'': I gave you a golden ring to 
show you my love, You went to stick it in a printed circuit To fix 
a voltage leak in your collector You plug my feelings into your detector 
You never spend your nights with me You don't go out with other girls 
either You prefer your collider You only love your collider. Celebrating 
the LHC, which will be a Mecca for American as well as European high-energy 
physicists, the Cernettes have renamed themselves ``Les Horribles 
Cernettes,'' or LHC for short, and they have posted some songs on 
their Web page: http://sgvenus.cern.ch/musiclub/cernettes. Owners 
of computers with sound cards can hear the Cernettes (who often emulate 
the Supremes) croon catchy tunes like ``Strong Interaction'' (``You 
quark me up, you quark me down, you quark me top, you quark me bottom''), 
``Antiworld,'' ``Surfing on the Web'' and ``Microwave Love.'' Since 
its birth in 1954, CERN's achievements have included monumental discoveries 
in particle physics, a succession of Nobel prizes and the construction 
of a proton collider that may yield enough energy to discover the 
elusive Higgs boson _ a theoretical particle supposedly responsible 
for endowing all matter with mass _ and a magazine read by physicists 
around the world. But for ordinary people, CERN's most memorable achievement 
was to invent the World Wide Web as a way to organize and find information 
on the Internet. The laboratory originally used its Web system as 
a communication network for physicists, but it grew as the Internet 
became as universal as the world's postal system. As the Web outgrew 
the laboratory, CERN cast off its creation, which is now administered 
by others. De Genarro, an Italian, writes his songs entirely in English 
``because English is the universal language of physics.'' But this 
has created something of a language barrier between the CERN laboratory 
and the French and Swiss people outside it. Most of CERN's neighbors 
do not understand the jokes in his songs. ``Our concerts are more 
popular in France than in Switzerland,'' he said, ``because the Swiss 
seem to think we're too noisy.'' The Cernettes are not the only performers 
specializing in physics songs. In the United States, Dr. Lynda Williams 
_ a former go-go dancer who teaches physics at San Francisco State 
University _ has become a smash hit at physics conferences. Her on-stage 
gyrations and clever allusions to physics keep audiences of specialists 
roaring with laughter. One of the theories she tackles is ``supersymmetry.'' 
Many physicists believe this theory will eventually unite the realm 
of the ultra large (as described by relativity) and the ultra small 
(governed by quantum mechanics). The idea is that for every particle 
of matter there may be an unseen supersymmetric particle of some force 
carrier, and that for every known force carrier (photons of light, 
for example) there is an unseen particle of supersymmetric matter. 
Such particles are called ``sparticles,'' ``squarks,'' and so on. 
Williams' song, to the tune of George Gershwin's ``S'wonderful,'' 
pokes fun at the government's cancellation in 1993 of the Superconducting 
Supercollider (SSC), which would have been the largest accelerator 
in the world: S'quantum dream, squandered it, Bad publicity. A'awfully 
sad, S'could of had Our own SSC. But where did the funding go? Must 
be hiding with the higgsinos S'wonderful, s'marvelous There's still 
the LHC!
