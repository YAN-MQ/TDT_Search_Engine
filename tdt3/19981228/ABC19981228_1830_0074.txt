Good evening. In northern Iraq today, for the first time in the latest 
U.S. confrontation with Iraq, the Iraqis fired missiles at U.S. warplanes. 
In response, U.S. planes fired on an Iraqi air defense installation. 
That much is agreed upon. The Iraqis said four of their soldiers were 
killed in what they called criminal attack. And late today, the Iraqi 
news agency reported at least one "enemy plane" was probably shot 
down. The U.S. says that never happened. ABC's Sam Donaldson has details 
from the White House. sam? Connie, Pentagon officials categorically 
deny Iraq's claim that a U.S. aircraft was shot down, insisting all 
returned safely to base. But the incident is worrisome for what it 
may mean for the future in patrolling the two no-fly zones the U.S. 
and Britain have enforced for years over Iraq. U.S. F-15 and F-16 
warplanes, operating from their base at incerlik, turkey, were patrolling 
the skies over Iraq near the city of mosul, in the northern no-fly 
zone, when, according to Pentagon officials, they were fired on by 
at least three Iraqi surface-to-air missiles, which all missed. U.S. 
aircraft fired back using H.A.R.M. anti-radar missiles apparently 
destroying the action when fired on, and President Clinton said today 
they will continue to do so. The no-fly zones have been and will remain 
an important part of our containment policy. Because we effectively 
control the skies over much of Iraq, Saddam has been unable to use 
air power to repress his own people or to lash out again at his neighbors. 
Our pilots have the authority to protect themselves if they're threatened 
or attacked. By protecting themselves may be more difficult for U.S. 
pilots just now. ABC News has learned that U.S. military forces have 
lost track of some 20 iraqi battery is, which Saddam bis percented 
just before the recent heavy bombing of Iraq. Furthermore, the Iraqis 
perfected a technique of quickly flicking their radar on and off to 
fire their missiles, making it more difficult for U.S. pilot99 pilots 
to lock on to their missile batteries. Military officials believe 
they can handle all of this, but they're bracing for more shooting 
incidents in the days ahead. Thank you, Sam.
