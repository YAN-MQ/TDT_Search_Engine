And finally the celebrated southern writer, Eudora Weltie is currently 
receiving the kind of attention many writers earn only after their 
death. She recently became the first living author to have her collected 
works included in the Library of America series. She's also the subject 
of a new biography called, "Eudora, a Writer's Life" by Anne Waldren. 
The biography was written over the opposition of Eudora Weltie herself, 
who felt her work should stand on their own. But, Anne Waldren believes 
it was important to persist despite the objections. She's such an 
important figure, and there was so little biographical information 
out in the world, that I thought it was important for literary history 
for it to be written. Eudora Weltie was born in 1909 in the southern 
town of Jackson, Mississippi where she still lives. She's found a 
lifetime's worth of subject matter in her native region, becoming 
especially well known for her portrayals of the mistreated or underprivileged, 
white and black. Traveling around the state, she saw an awful lot 
of really poor people. And with her great humanity, and empathy, she 
used these people in her fiction. Although Eudora Weltie has written 
acclaimed novels like, "Delta Wedding" and "The Robber Bride Groom", 
Anne Waldren believes she's especially gifted as a short story writer. 
Her biography is only the first, she predicts. Despite Eudora Weltie's 
feelings on the matter, other authors will be exploring her life and 
legacy in the years ahead. That's all for Book Briefs, I'm Nancy Beardsley.
