The quest for beauty is taking a new turn in the country of India. 
Women are slathering on beauty creams with an expensive ingredient. 
Sanjay Singh has more. Image conscious Indians with money are rushing 
to the cosmetics counter for that golden touch. It's the infwreedient 
in new beauty creams launched recently. This woman, the country's 
leading her balance cosmetics manufacturer, says the creams have made 
a golden debut. Makes the skin look more glossy and beautiful. That 
is -- you see, psychologically or in a woman, regardless, 24 karat 
gold on my skin, and the guarantee it's pure. That's a very, very 
good feeling. In ancient times, Queens used gold and diamond dust 
in an effort to make their skin more beautiful. And ancient Indian 
writings refer to gold's anti-aging properties. One mumbai manufacturer 
uses a version of the gold cream to attract those looking for a fairer 
complexion. Many Indians associate the concept of beauty with fair 
skin. These days all the boys are looking for fair girls, so the beauticians 
have to keep inventing fairness creams and different kinds of facials. 
That is why I have come up with this new cream. And satellite television 
have contributed to the growing desire for a fairer skin among women. 
But some therapists warn the strong chemicals being put in some products 
can be dangerous. Those using the bleach without proper knowledge 
can suffer side effects. Like applying the cream over pimples leaves 
black spots on the face. Some women's groups objected to the trend. 
To some critics India's obsession with a fair face is a legacy of 
its colonial past. But more than 50 years after the British left, 
market pundits are predicting a bright future for the fairness industry.
