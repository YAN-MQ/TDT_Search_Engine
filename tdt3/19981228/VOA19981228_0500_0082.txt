Fighting continues for a fourth day in Kosovo leaving at least 12 
dead, thousands fleeing their homes. Serbs and ethnic Albanians traded 
artillery and mortar and machine gun fire. The head of the Kosovo 
verification mission remains hopeful that the fighting can be ended 
before the ten-month-old truce in Kosovo is shattered completely. 
Envoy William Walker characterized the current violence in Kosovo 
as limited.
