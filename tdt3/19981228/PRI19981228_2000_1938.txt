South Africa's campaign to contain the spread of AIDS by promoting 
the use of condoms has suffered a setback. The government is investigating 
allegations it's been importing millions of faulty condoms from Asia. 
Health workers accuse authorities of not applying high standards to 
foreign manufacturers. South Africa's Deputy Director General of Health 
Dr. Harn Pitorias says the government is now tackling the problem.

were not up to -- and we were -- withdrew the batches that we have 
also a mechanism in place to try and prevent the substandard condoms 
entering the country. Dr. Harn Pitorias.
