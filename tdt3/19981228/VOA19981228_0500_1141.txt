In the American Football Conference, the New York Jets flew past the 
New England Patriots 31-10. The Patriots loss gave the Miami Dolphins 
home field advantage in their wildcard game Saturday against the Buffalo 
Bills. But Miami ended the regular season losing to the Atlanta Falcons 
38-16. The patriots nonetheless will travel to Jacksonville next Sunday 
to face the Jaguars. The Denver Broncos and the New York Jets have 
a BI in the AfC. The Broncos meanwhile tuned up for the post season 
with a record-setting 28-21 win over the Seattle Seahawks. Denver 
Runningback Terrrell Davis became just the fourth rusher to surpass 
2000 yards in a single season. Quarterback John Elway reached 300 
career touchdowns to join Dan Marino and Fran Tarkington in the record 
books. In Chicago the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears by 
a field goal 16-13. Packers' Safety LeRoy Butler says the game was 
a good warm-up for the playoffs. I like this type of game because 
we've been in all kind of tight games all year. And that's what the 
playoffs is all about, pressure. So, we bounce back, you know they 
had us against the wall there for a minute, but we fought back like 
good teams do.
