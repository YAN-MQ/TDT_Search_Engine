well, less than 24 hours after the final sunday of the nfl's regular 
season, and a number of teams wasted little time changing direction 
-- or more specifically, firing their head coaches. in all, five coaches 
got the ax today. here they are, in no particular order -- dave wannstedt 
of the chicago bears, ray rhodes of the philadelphia eagles, dom capers 
of the carolina panthers, ted marchibroda of the baltimore ravens 
and dennis erickson of the seattle seahawks. we made some bad decisions, 
personnel-wise, draft-wise, some free agency-wise. and i was involved 
in those decisions. we made them as an organization. it's about winning. 
and i didn't get it done this year. and when you don't get things 
done, these changes have to be made. it's a bottom-line business. 
and the goal is to win. and when you don't win, you know, these things 
happen. it was an amicable departure with mr. modell. i'm very happy 
with that. that's the way i would want things to happen, and thank 
goodness they happened that way. i respect their decision. they obviously 
have the option to do what they want. and they felt that they needed 
to make a change. and so they made a change. the cleveland browns 
interviewed their first potential head coach. today, the team met 
with vikings' offensive coordinator brian billick. if you want, he 
can be your pretend head coach when you play the fantasy football
