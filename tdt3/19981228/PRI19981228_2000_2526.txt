For today's geography quiz, we head to Southeastern Europe to a place 
where summer resorts on the Black Sea and winter skiing in the Carpathian 
Mountains. But as idyllic as the natural environs are, the political 
scene here has been anything but serene. A ruthless dictator led this 
country for 24 years. He was executed on Christmas Day of 1989. His 
legacy is one of the poorest countries in Europe, but that hasn't 
prevented thousands of its people from bingeing on holiday food and 
drink. At least 3,500 people in the capital alone went to the hospital 
emergency rooms this weekend, holding their bloated bellies and complaining 
of indigestion when they could talk. What's on the menu: pork chops 
and cabbage rolls. Wash it down with some prune alcohol and vodka 
and we'll top it off with the answer, coming up.
