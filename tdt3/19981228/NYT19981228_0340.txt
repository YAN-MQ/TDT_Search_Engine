Coming! Tonight on ``Nova''! The Perils of Pearl! By this dire assessment, 
the ever-growing hazards facing oysters and their lustrous produce 
are so daunting that it is a wonder any of the gems are still on the 
market, but no wonder that their prices are in the stratosphere. Without 
the intrusion of humans, as ``The Perfect Pearl'' explains, nature 
would not on its own be able to satisfy the ineffable allure of something 
to go with that simple black frock. It took Japanese innovators to 
perfect a process known as nucleation, once secret but described here, 
to create the cultured pearls to satisfy the demand. The progression 
from mollusk to gem has never been easy. An Australian pearl gatherer 
says that in his father's lifetime of effort, ``he wouldn't have been 
able to put one string of perfect pearls together.'' Oysters are sensitive 
creatures; they are vulnerable to overcrowding, to high waves and 
sudden temperature fluctuations, to parasites and pollution and physical 
stress, particularly because the culturing process, shown close up, 
requires surgery. The hour focuses on threats and rescues. It takes 
at least two years to produce a big enough pearl to make the job worthwhile. 
Most customers, we learn, settle for relatively modest Japanese pearls, 
while rich showoffs go in for rare giant South Sea pearls, which can 
bring unspeakable sums in New York's auction houses. Fashion has lately 
turned to black pearls, mostly produced in remote coral atolls of 
Tahiti. A designer boasts of detecting at least 40 different colors 
of black, the most desirable this season being ``blackie-green.'' 
You can see some shimmerings tonight. Matching the gems by shape, 
color, luster and size is a laborious specialty in itself, but evidently 
worth it. The world record for an Australian South Sea necklace, set 
at Sotheby's in 1993, stands at $2.3 million. Check it out. You have 
quite a few shopping days till Christmas. BROADCAST NOTES: `The Perfect 
Pearl' 8 p.m. Tuesday on PBS
