Still ahead -- racing toward disaster. A sudden storm turns a famous 
yacht race into a battle for survival. I really did not feel like 
I was going to be found at one point. I kept up hope. But honksly, 
it looked pretty grim. Overwhelmed by monstrous seas, it's a race 
to stay alive. And those sudden celebrities of this past year -- what 
ever happened to you know who? You know, the last I looked, the average 
workday lasts more than a few hours, right? Right. But average pain 
relievers may work for a few hours then quit. Well, now there's aleve. 
Aleve's the one with the strength... to work on arthritis pain all 
day long with just two pills. It would take eight Tylenol to do that. 
So, if your pain reliever isn't putting in a full day's work-- fire 
it. Fire it. And take aleve. Two pills, all day relief. Works for 
me. It's acid. It Burns. It travels up. Like a fire in my chest. A 
terrible taste in my throat. If heartburn has you by the throat, you 
may have the toughest heartburn... for this, doctors recommend gaviscon. 
Only regular gaviscon forms a soothing, protective barrier to help 
keep stomach acid down, where it belongs. Mylanta can't. Pepcid ac 
can't. Only gaviscon can. Better. Relief. Sleep.
