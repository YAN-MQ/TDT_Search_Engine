Stay with us now, we've got a lot of all kinds of wonderful and strange 
things to tell you in the next half hour, the next hour of VOA News 
Now. It's 21 hours 30 Universal Time, and this is VOA News Now. US 
War planes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern Iraq fired missiles 
at an Iraqi air defense site, Monday. Algerian officials say Muslim 
rebels have killed 15 people including eight children in the worst 
massacre in Algeria since the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. 
All that and we'll look at a new treatment for diabetes in our next 
half hour of VOA News Now. Now, a summary of world news. I'm Robert 
Burns, VOA News.
