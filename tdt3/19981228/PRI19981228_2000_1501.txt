In other business news, all is not well in America's vital trade relationship 
with Europe. Liz George reports from our business desk in New York. 
It all started with a row over bananas. Now it's escalated to a bitter 
dispute between the United States and Europe, one of the biggest trading 
relationships in the world. America has slapped sanctions on a long 
list of imports, from candles to cashmere sweaters -- all in retaliation 
over the EU's banana-buying policy. Charlene Barchevsky, is the U.S. 
Trade Representative. We have won our case against Europe. We have 
acquired rights by -- their case. And we intend to pursue the rights 
we have acquired through the litigation. The United States is seeing 
exports fall off in the aftermath of global economic contagion and 
cheap imports are flooding the marketplace. The trade deficits expected 
to continue to grow in 1999. And Ambassador Barchevsky says, while 
imports are good for the economy, she'll vigorously defend the marketplace 
from any unfair practices. I think in terms of policy response, the 
U.S. really has two guideposts. One, of course, is that we will vigorously 
enforce our unfair trade laws, which are entirely WTO-consistent. 
And, of course, direct that imports be fairly traded. We, of course, 
look at all options, but always remembering that what goes around 
in trade, comes around and that to the extent the United States turns 
markedly inward, other economies may be encouraged to do the same. 
That would further diminish our export performance and further disrupt 
the United States economy. Meanwhile, the U.S. remains the biggest 
global buyer, importing more goods than any other country in the world. 
And Americans take the top spot as consumers of last resort, spending 
more per person than any other nation. And it's precisely this, which 
may lead the global economy towards recovery next year. For "The World," 
I'm Liz George in New York.
