After months of negotiations, the two biggest opposition parties in 
Bosnia agreed Monday to unite. The Social Democratic Party, led by 
Zlatko Lagumdzija and the Social Democrats, led by the mayor of the 
northern city of Tuzla, Selim Beslagic, were in negotiations for almost 
a year. They were both encouraged by foreign mediators as well as 
by social democrats from Europe to unify and establish a strong front 
against the nationalists who have been in power for the last eight 
years. ``This is an act which will swing the pendulum to the other 
side,'' said Lagumdzija, referring to the inability of the social 
democrats to take power from the ethnically-based nationalists who 
have dominated politics. Officials of the office of Bosnia's top international 
mediator, Carlos Westendorp, welcomed the unification and said anything 
that furthers democracy in the country was a good sign. The name of 
the new party will be the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
It will hold a congress at the end of February, officials said at 
the signing ceremony held in Tuzla. Both of the parties separately 
have gained enough support to be represented at all levels of Bosnia's 
complicated political structure. The first party president will come 
from Lagumdzija's party and the president of the main board from Beslagic's. 
The posts will be given out in proportion with the last September's 
election results. Both parties are active throughout the country in 
both the Bosnian Serb half and the Muslim-Croat Federation. ``This 
will not only be a simple sum of two parties but it will represent 
a new power that will gather all citizens of Bosnia that have so far 
refrained from voting,'' said Beslagic. He referred to the numerous 
Bosnians who believed there was nobody who could ever beat the nationalists 
and thought it was pointless to vote. Officials of both parties denied 
the unification was done under foreign pressure. They claimed it was 
rather a product of good will and the attempt to come closer to Europe, 
where social democrats are strong.
