A Rome court on Monday took up a recommendation by Italy's justice 
minister, ruling against a Turkish request to order Kurdish rebel 
leader Abdullah Ocalan back to jail. Turkey wants Ocalan jailed to 
prevent him from fleeing the country while Italy considers Ankara's 
request to extradite the guerrilla leader on charges that do not carry 
the death penalty. Italy has so far refused to extradite Ocalan to 
Turkey for trial on terrorism charges, citing laws that prevent it 
from extraditing suspects to countries where they face the death penalty. 
But Turkey insists Ocalan can be extradited for crimes that do not 
carry capital punishment and is pressuring the Italian government 
to do so. Italy's justice minister last week rejected Turkey's request 
to jail Ocalan, but the final say rested with Rome's appeal court. 
Ocalan, who leads the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK, is reportedly 
negotiating with a number of governments outside the European Union 
to take him in. He has been looking for a safe place to go since Syria 
expelled him earlier this year in response to heavy pressure from 
Turkey. The Kurd has been staying in a villa on the outskirts of the 
capital since about a week after he was arrested Nov. 12 at the Rome 
airport, where he arrived on a flight from Moscow. The PKK has been 
fighting in southeastern Turkey to gain autonomy for the country's 
Kurds since 1984. Close to 37,000 people have been killed since the 
conflict began.
