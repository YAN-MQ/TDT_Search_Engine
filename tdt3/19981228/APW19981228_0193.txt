An emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers, scheduled Wednesday 
to discuss the U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq, has been postponed 
until after the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Arab diplomats 
told The Associated Press on Monday that the meeting has been rescheduled 
for Jan. 24. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity. Earlier, 
Egyptian newspapers had reported that moves were under way to get 
the meeting put off. ``There is a trend towards postponing the emergency 
meeting,'' the daily Al-Akbar said. Plans for this week's meeting 
were announced by U.N. Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid after 
the U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq. The four days of attacks, 
which ended Dec. 19, were aimed at punishing the Baghdad regime for 
refusing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. Yemen has said 
it wants the foreign ministers to consider calling a summit on Iraq 
_ a country on which Arab nations remain deeply divided. On Sunday, 
Arab diplomats said that Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud 
al-Faisal, visited Cairo to ask Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to 
back the kingdom's request that any meeting be put off until after 
Ramadan. Muslims fast from dawn to dusk during Ramadan, which commemorates 
Mohammed's receiving the Koran from God. The holy month ends in mid-January. 
Egyptian officials would not confirm that the Saudi envoy was here. 
Late Sunday, Mubarak issued one of his strongest statements to date 
about Iraq, blaming Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for provoking the 
U.S.-British attacks. ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason 
for all the problems ... and Egypt naturally does not support this 
regime,'' Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying in its early 
Monday edition. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been pushing 
for the Arab League ministers meeting and would like to see it followed 
by a summit. After meeting Sunday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed 
Saeed al-Sahhaf in the Yemeni capital San`a, Saleh told reporters 
that ``convening an urgent Arab summit aims at restoring Arab solidarity.'' 
It is ``a badly needed Pan-Arab necessity through which Arabs can 
discuss all their issues in a spirit of reconciliation and frankness,'' 
he added. Iraq wants the Arab League to back its demand that the U.N. 
Security Council lift crippling economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War. Baghdad 
also wants the Arab League to condemn the American and British airstrikes. 
But some Arab countries, especially Iraq's Gulf neighbors, are not 
yet ready to forgive Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. And most have 
demanded that Iraq fulfill its obligations under U.N. resolutions 
before the sanctions are lifted. U.N. inspectors must certify that 
Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction before the Security 
Council will reconsider the sanctions issue.
