To write ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' the fictional reminiscences of a 
geisha in Kyoto during the 1930s and 40s, Arthur Golden, a 42-year-old 
father of two, and an American at that, had to cross three great boundaries: 
gender, nationality and history. He had to imagine what it would be 
like to be a 9-year-old girl sold to a geisha house. He had to understand 
what the same character at 15 would feel when she faced the nasty 
old man who had just made the highest bid in an auction of her virginity. 
He also had to know the smallest details of her daily life: how she 
would apply her makeup and create her elaborate hairstyle. On Jan. 
3, ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' will have been on The New York Times' best-seller 
list for 58 weeks. It has been translated into 26 languages, and Steven 
Spielberg plans to direct the movie version. All this, despite the 
fact that the book, regardless of the implications of its title, is 
not about sex. ``The idea of the geisha is frequently misunderstood 
in the West,'' Golden said in an interview at his home in Brookline, 
Mass. ``Geisha are not prostitutes. They have no training about sex.'' 
The geisha's job is to entertain groups of men with drinking games 
and witty remarks, so they can ``avoid being a bunch of bleary-eyed 
guys,'' he said. ``She giggles at jokes, makes you think you're charming,'' 
he added. Geisha are not available for brief sexual encounters, though 
in the past young girls were sold to the highest bidder for deflowering 
in a rite known as a mizuage. But a geisha may have a long-term sexual 
relationship with a danna, a wealthy man who supports her. ``Memoirs 
of a Geisha'' is about 9-year-old Chiyo, a girl with unusual gray-blue 
eyes, who is sold by her destitute father to an okiya, or geisha house. 
She is initiated into the geisha's rigorous rites, lessons in dancing 
and playing the shamisen, a banjo-like instrument, and in the art 
of the tea ceremony. She learns to flirt by flicking her kimono to 
give a glimpse of her wrist. All the while, she is bullied by an exquisite 
and rivalrous geisha, Hatsumomo. Chiyo falls in love with the chairman 
of a giant electric company, but he remains aloof from her. Eventually, 
she is rescued by another geisha, Mameha. Chiyo, now called Sayuri 
professionally, undergoes a mizuage, when her virginity is sold to 
Dr. Crab, who collects blood samples from virgins he has deflowered. 
But by the novel's end, Sayuri is one of the most renowned geisha 
of her time. Golden first got the idea for ``Memoirs'' in 1982 when 
he was working at an English-language magazine in Tokyo. A Japanese 
colleague was the son of a famous industrialist and a geisha. ``It 
was an open secret,'' Golden said. ``Having grown up on the edge of 
an empire myself, I was fascinated by his illegitimacy.'' Golden is 
a member of the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which owns the controlling 
stock in The New York Times Co. His mother, Ruth S. Holmberg, is a 
sister of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the company's chairman emeritus. 
She is chairwoman of the company that has published The Chattanooga 
Times, currently being sold by the family, which owned it for more 
than a century. (Despite the family connection, the Chattanooga company 
is not affiliated with The New York Times Co.) Golden spent his childhood 
in Chattanooga, far from the center of Sulzberger family life in New 
York. Golden grew up, he said, with a sense of ``awe'' about The New 
York Times, but also knowing members of the paper's top management 
by their first names. He visited his grandmother, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, 
at her country house, Hillandale, in Stamford, Conn. ``I was a little 
kid still running around in my bathing suit all day long, and President 
Truman came and had tea with my mother and grandmother while I played 
with his grandchildren at the pool,'' Golden said. Golden attended 
Harvard University and then earned a master's degree in Japanese history 
at Columbia University, planning to become a college professor. In 
1980, on a trip to Beijing to study Chinese, he met Trudy Legge, a 
graduate student from the University of Washington. Her father was 
a union organizer in Pittsburgh, her mother, a nurse. ``I sat her 
down and told her about my family,'' Golden said. ``She said she thought, 
`Oh no, this will never work!' '' They married in 1982 and have two 
children, Hays, 14, and Tess, 11. Today the family lives in a blue-green 
shingled house built in 1896. Above the living room mantel is a painting 
of a swan-necked woman by William James, the son of the philosopher 
and nephew of Henry James. Golden said he had considered working for 
The New York Times. ``I decided in the end not to do it,'' he said. 
``I wanted to write on my own. Now, I had taken my life in my hands.'' 
After trying a nonfiction book about Japan, he decided to write a 
novel. He checked out library books on writing and re-read his favorite 
authors _ Nabokov, Dickens and Jane Austen. He enrolled in the creative 
writing program at Boston University, where he got another master's 
degree. In 1987 he began researching geisha and discovered ``a subculture 
with its own strange rules.'' He wrote 750 pages in the third person, 
then ``got a call from a friend of my grandmother's.'' The friend 
knew a geisha, Mineko Iwasaki, who agreed to an interview. Ms. Iwasaki 
was 42, retired, and married with a child. When she was 19, her virginity 
was sold for a record price at the time, around $850,000 in today's 
dollars. Ms. Iwasaki was able to give Golden crucial details about 
the daily rituals of geisha, though he did not base the character 
of Sayuri on her, he added. Most women become geisha because they 
are drawn to the classical arts, Golden said. When the profession 
was at its height in the 1930s, there were some 800 geisha in the 
Gion district of Kyoto. Today only about 80 geisha remain. After Golden's 
interviews with Ms. Iwasaki, it took him three more years to write 
a second draft of his book. All the while he worried that his family, 
with its strong work ethic, would disapprove. Then, when he showed 
the draft to friends, they told him the book was ``dry,'' Golden said. 
``My reaction was a weeklong anxiety attack.'' He decided to make 
the main character a child, so the reader could share her sense of 
wonder at each new experience. And, he said, he decided to ``enter 
her mind.'' ``I was afraid to try to impersonate a woman,'' he said, 
but he added: ``I knew I can fake the past. It turns out the same 
skill goes into faking another gender.'' nn In the book, he describes 
in intimate terms the way a geisha applies her makeup, first a cream 
of nightingale droppings to her face, then wax. After that, thick 
white makeup, and garish dots of red blush on the cheeks. Her hair 
is combed with camellia oil and hot wax, then pulled tight and, for 
the apprentice geisha, wound in a bun around a piece of red silk in 
a style called ``a split peach.'' To preserve her hairstyle, she sleeps 
with her neck on a wooden cradle called a takamakura. Golden also 
describes in detail her elaborate kimonos. There is one of ``scarlet 
and yellow, which showed leaves scattered in a field of golden grasses.'' 
Another has ``silver birds flying against a night sky, with a mysterious 
landscape of dark trees and rocks.'' In 1996 he finished the book. 
It was sold to Alfred A. Knopf for $250,000. The Washington Post called 
it ``a breathtaking performance twice over, once by its bewitching 
central figure; and once by the masterful puppeteer who has given 
her life.'' Michiko Kakutani praised it in a weekday review in the 
The New York Times as ``a finely observed picture of an anomalous 
and largely vanished world.'' One dissenting note was in The New York 
Times Book Review. ``If Golden had chosen to write the biography of 
a geisha rather than her fictional autobiography, he might have achieved 
a lot more by settling for hardly less,'' the reviewer, John David 
Morley, wrote. Writing ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' Golden said, was like 
waging a war. Sometimes, he felt like a ``general looking down at 
the battlefield, trying to make a strategic decision,'' he said. At 
other times, he was ``the guy in the trenches with the rifle.'' But 
10 years, 3 drafts and 2,300 raw manuscript pages later, Golden seems 
to have won his war.
