President Clinton says a new justice department report proves his 
administration's crime prevention policies are working. The report 
shows the violent crime rate in the United States fell in 1997 to 
its lowest level since the department began keeping such records 25 
years ago. The latest figures show 39 households out of 1,000 reported 
incidents of violent crime in 1997, down from 42 per 1,000 in 1996 
and 48 per 1,000 in 1973. Property crime is also down, with incidents 
reported for 248 out of 1,000 households in 1997. That's compared 
to 266 per 1,000 in 1996 and 554 per 1,000 25 years ago.
