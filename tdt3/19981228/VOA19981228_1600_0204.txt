West African foreign ministers are meeting in Ivory Coast to examine 
the crisis in Sierra Leone. As VOA's John Pittman reports from Abijon, 
the ministers have expressed their support for the West African peacekeeping 
mission in Sierra Leone, but have urged the two warring sides to seek 
a negotiated settlement to the conflict Monday's meeting in Abijon 
was called by Nigeria, whose soldiers and equipment make up the balk 
of the West African peacekeeping force ECOMAG. In recent days ECOMAG's 
resources, in Sierra Leone, have been strained by a series of major 
clashes with rebels from the Revolutionary United Front. At the Abijon 
meeting's opening ceremony, the Executive Secretary of the Economic 
Community of West African States, Mansante Kuyante underscored the 
need for ECOMAG to be reinforced. However, Mr. Kuyante also stressed 
that a long-term solution to the crisis in Sierra Leone would require 
negotiations between the government and the rebels, not an escalation 
of the military conflict. After the opening ceremony, the ministers 
met behind closed doors to hear situation reports from the ECOMAG 
force commander and Sierra Leone's foreign minister. John Pittman,
