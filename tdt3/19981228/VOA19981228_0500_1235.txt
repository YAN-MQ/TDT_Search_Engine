Well, the New York Giants fell short of reaching the National League 
Playoffs. Running Back Gary Brown has carried the ball far enough 
to land a new four-year contract. The New York Post Newspaper says 
the Giants will pay the 29-year-old Brown nearly $5 million including 
a $1.3 million signing bonus. The deal is a hefty pay raise from the 
$300,000 one-year contract the Giants gave Brown for this season as 
a free agent. Brown finished the year, Sunday, with a career high 
1063 yards rushing as the Giants defeated the Philadelphia Eagles.
