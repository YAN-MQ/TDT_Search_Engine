Oleg Romantsev, who resigned two years ago as coach of Russia's national 
soccer team, was reappointed to the job Monday, news reports said. 
The team has seen a long succession of coaches during the past few 
years, with each resigning or getting fired over some embarrassing 
loss. Each time, soccer officials have sought to rev up the team's 
sluggish performance. Romantsev stepped down in July, 1996, three 
weeks after the squad was sent home from the European Championship 
after the first round. His successors hardly did better. Russia's 
last coach, Anatoly Byshovets, was sacked earlier this month, after 
just five months in the job, over Russia's loss to Iceland in European 
Championship qualifiers in October. Russia's Soccer Union decided 
Monday to reappoint Romantsev, 44, as coach of the national team, 
the Interfax news agency reported. The decline of Russia's soccer 
performance has been accompanied by corruption, power struggles and 
violence that have plagued the soccer union in recent years. The Russian 
soccer team has not qualified for the World Cup since 1994.
