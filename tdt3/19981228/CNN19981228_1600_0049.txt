U.S. military officials believe the pilots were successful in striking 
the iraqi defense system and say they were defending themselves against 
"an act of aggression." The U.S. planes returned safely to their base 
in Turkey. Officials in Baghdad claim there was no incident to provoke 
the attacks. They say four Iraqi soldiers were killed. The exchange 
of fire came nine days after the United States and Britain ended "operation 
desert fox," aimed at punishing Iraq for ending cooperation with United 
Nations weapons inspectors. President Clinton says the pilots did 
the right thing. No-fly zones have been and will remain an important 
part of our containment policy. Because we effectivively control the 
skies over much of Iraq, Saddam has been unable to use air power to 
repress his own people or to lash out again at his neighbors. Our 
pilots have the authority to protect themselves if they're threatened 
or attacked. They took appropriate action today in responding to Iraq's 
actions.
