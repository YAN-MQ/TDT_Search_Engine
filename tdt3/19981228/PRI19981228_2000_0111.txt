Meanwhile, proposals for an Arab summit to discuss policy towards 
Iraq have been put on hold. A preparatory foreign minister's meeting 
was supposed to take place this week. Barbara Platt reports from Cairo. 
Arab leaders have held only one summit since the Gulf War and Baghdad 
wasn't invited. So it's no surprise that talk of a summit about the 
airstrikes on Iraq brought Arab divisions into sharp focus. The head 
of the Arab league Esmat Abdul McGee said he'd been asked by the Gulf 
monarchies to postpone a foreign minister's preparatory meeting to 
next month, although Gulf ministers may hold their own meeting on 
Tuesday. It seems that Saudi Arabia had the strongest objections. 
Cairo appeared to have similar reservations. President Hosni Mubarak 
stressed that Egypt supported Iraq's people, but not its government 
and said Baghdad was to blame for the crisis. Barbara Platt in Cairo.
