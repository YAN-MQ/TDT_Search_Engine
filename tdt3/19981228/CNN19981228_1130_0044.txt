A Pentagon spokesman says there was an act of aggression against U.S. 
aircraft flying over northern Iraq today, and the United States took 
appropriate action. CNN has confirmed two U.S. warplanes fired on 
Iraqi targets. Iraq says the U.S. planes fired first. But the Pentagon 
says the planes were responding to a "hostile act." U.S. military 
officials believe the pilots were successful in hitting the iraqi 
air defense system. Iraq's government says four Iraqis are dead and 
seven others are injured. There are no U.S. casualties reported and 
the planes returned safely to their base in Turkey. The incident comes 
just nine days after "operation desert fox," in which the U.S. and 
Britain tried to punish Iraq for failing to fully cooperate with U.N. 
weapons inspectors. President Clinton was briefed on the situation 
this morning. Once again, I want to tell you, I am very proud of the 
work they do, the risks they take, the skill and the professionalism 
with which they do it. They attacked because they were attacked. And 
they did the appropriate thing. We will continue to enforce the no-fly 
zones. The incident happened over the northern no-fly zone. Planes 
patrol the area to protect Kurds in the region.
