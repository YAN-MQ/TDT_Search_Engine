the computer bug known as y2k threatens to wreak havoc as we start 
the new millennium. but the president says social security recipients 
needn't worry. they will get their checks. chris black has more. the 
turn of the century is still 368 days away, but president clinton 
says the social security administration has mastered the millennium 
bug that threatened to shut down government computers. the social 
security system is now 100% compliant with our standards and safeguards 
for the year 2000. to make absolutely certain, the system has been 
tested and validated by a panel of independent experts. the system 
works, it is secure. and therefore, older americans can feel more 
secure. the social security administration collects taxes from 145 
million workers, processes 6 million applications and delivers checks 
to 48 million elderly, disabled and dependent americans each year. 
the bottom-line mission of the social security administration is really 
quite simple -- get the right benefit payment to the right person 
at the right time. the federal government has spent ten years and 
$40 million to review and fix 35 million lines of software to guarantee 
the social security computers would keep working when the clock strikes 
midnight on december 31st, 1999. a social security recipient two days 
shy of her 90th birthday testifies to the importance of timely delivery 
of checks. there are many, many people who suffer and would suffer 
greatly if those checks did not come on time. commissioner apfel says 
not to worry. we are y2k-okay. and that means on january 1st, 2000, 
those checks are gonna be there. president clinton and vice president 
al gore have challenged every member of the cabinet to fix the year 
2000 computer problem. with a year to go, clinton administration officials 
say that 61% of all critical federal systems are now y2k-compliant.
