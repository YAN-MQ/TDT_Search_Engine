There has been another defection from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu's Likud Party. VOA's David Gulles in Jerusalem reports that 
Bennie Begin, son of the late Prime Minister Menakhem Begin has left 
to run for Prime Minister, as head of a new far right party. Mr. Netanyahu 
may be holding on as leader of Likud but the party is splintering 
on both its left and right flanks. Bennie Begin, son of the party's 
founder and a staunch opponent of territorial concessions to the Palestinians 
confirmed his departure at a Tel Aviv news conference. His announcement 
followed by just a few days that of moderate former Finance Minister 
Dan Meridor who has left to form a new centrist party. An erosion 
of Mr. Netanyahu's right wing coalition in Parliament forced him to 
accept a call for new elections. The Date for voting has not yet been 
set, but the campaign is already bitter. Mr. Netanyahu accused the 
main opposition labor party, Sunday night, of working with Palestinian 
leader Yasir Arafat to insure his defeat, prompting Labor leader, 
Yahud Barrach to accuse the Prime Minister of incitement and dirty 
politics. David Gullest VOA News, Jerusalem. In addition, Israel's 
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharron says he will not challenge incumbent 
Benjamin Netanyahu for the Prime Minister's post. In an address to 
Likud Party Central Committee, Mr. Sharron says he does not want to 
be Prime Minister. Instead he called upon party members to rally behind 
Mr. Netanyahu. The Prime Minister also addressed the committee and 
vowed to win Israel's early elections.
