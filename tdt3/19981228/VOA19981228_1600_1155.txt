Well, the season appears to be over before it begins in the National 
Basketball Association after five hours of secret negotiations Sunday 
ended with both sides still far apart. With a January 7th league imposed 
deadline to reach a deal or scrap the entire season, commissioner 
David Sterns and player's chief Billy Hunter offered no optimism. 
Sterns say he made a final proposal with some improvements but the 
leagues chief legal officer says he thinks it's not enough. Only six 
people were on hand for the secret meeting in Denver with no announced 
plans to get together again.
