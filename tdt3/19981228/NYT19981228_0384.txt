Last year ``Seinfeld,'' the top-rated television show in white households, 
ranked 50th in African-American homes, according to Nielsen Media 
Research, while the comedy ``Between Brothers,'' No. 1 in black households, 
ranked 112th among whites. Similarly, according to Nielsen, in the 
first two months of the current prime-time season, ``The Steve Harvey 
Show,'' a comedy, ranked No. 1 in black households and 118th in white 
households, while ``Friends,'' the No. 1 comedy and No. 2 show in 
white households, ranked 91st among blacks. Prime-time television 
has rarely been as racially divided as it is today, both in terms 
of casts and audiences, a fact most striking in network television's 
dominant form of entertainment, comedy. Networks, under enormous pressure 
to maximize dwindling profits, have been focusing on the more numerous 
and generally more affluent white households that advertisers prefer. 
Because whites rarely watch shows, particularly sitcoms, with largely 
black casts, the networks broadcast relatively few with black or even 
integrated casts in prime time, the three-hour block from 8 to 11 
p.m. that is the most lucrative and competitive portion of television 
programming. Given the growing popularity of cable, the four major 
networks, ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, plus the upstarts, WB and UPN, have 
seen their share of overall viewers reduced to less than 60 percent, 
but cable's audience is fragmented by dozens of channels, and the 
networks still reach the largest audiences by far. The growing racial 
divide reverses a trend toward greater integration of actors and toward 
the production of more crossover shows in the 70s and 80s, when path 
breaking series with heavily black casts like ``Good Times'' and ``The 
Cosby Show'' achieved great popularity. In addition, many of the current 
shows featuring blacks are increasingly bunched together and segregated 
from the rest of the prime-time schedule. This has led to bitter feelings 
among many black producers, writers and actors, who say they are often 
asked to make their shows less overtly black in a largely vain effort 
to attract white viewers. These requests often take the form of demands 
to ``broaden the appeal'' of the shows, code for adding more white 
characters. ``There is always a concerted effort by white executives 
to place white faces on black shows,'' said Steve Harvey, whose show 
is on the WB network. ``We have had to place white faces on our show 
this year. We didn't ask for it. It came down on us. We happen to 
like those characters, and they've worked out well. But how often 
do you find it going the other way? There's never an expectation that 
a white show needs a few more black faces.'' (Of course, members of 
other minority groups, including Hispanics and Asian-Americans, have 
complained that they are underrepresented on prime time. Blacks have 
been fighting for representation the longest, while there are now 
a growing number of Spanish-language programs aimed at Hispanics, 
as well as the black-oriented cable channel, BET. As much as they 
might prefer a different dynamic, a number of television executives, 
all white, said they were business people, not social reformers, and 
they maintained that there was generally little resistance from audiences 
to the trend of racial polarization, and thus little incentive to 
fight it. ``I don't think anybody's crying out for integrated shows,'' 
said Sandy Grushow, the president of 20th Century Fox Television, 
which produces shows for several networks. ``By pursuing advertisers 
and demographics rather than a mass audience, the networks have declared 
they don't need blacks in their audience.'' Some network executives 
say they have tried to change the situation, citing examples like 
``The Hughleys,'' a new ABC sitcom about a black family that moves 
from the inner city to a white suburb; ``The Gregory Hines Show,'' 
which ran on CBS last year but failed; and Fox's ``Getting Personal,'' 
a show with an integrated cast, which also was unable to find an audience. 
And the executives point out that the record is not so bad in some 
programming categories. Among one-hour dramas, for instance, popular 
shows like ``Homicide,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' ``Touched by an Angel'' and 
``ER'' have prominent black characters. But comedies account for roughly 
three-quarters of prime-time fare, and the racial divide is most evident 
on these shows. ``The Steve Harvey Show,'' for instance, was watched 
by about 2 million black households, 17 percent of the total for blacks, 
but 923,000 white households, 1.1 percent of total white households. 
Some experts say the situation reflects reality for most Americans: 
Dramas frequently involve the workplace, where integration has become 
more prevalent, while comedies often focus on home life, which is 
more segregated. Still, the divide has perplexed many within the industry. 
``I am not a sociologist, so I don't know what it indicates,'' said 
Jamie Tarses, the president of ABC Entertainment. But she added: ``In 
the business I'm in, what we're trying to do, it makes sense for us 
to reach as wide a place as we can. We're not trying to reach a niche 
audience.'' Many blacks in television argue, however, that more shows 
would cross the racial divide if marketed more aggressively. ``The 
networks assume white America is much more racist than they've been 
proven to be in other areas,'' said Ralph Farquhar, a producer of 
shows like ``Moesha,'' ``South Central'' and ``The Sinbad Show,'' 
all part of a new generation of black shows introduced in the last 
decade. ``How do you explain the popularity of the NBA or rap music? 
There's crossover if there's an effort to create the exposure. It's 
a marketing problem. But they don't want to do that. So there's a 
chitlin circuit on TV.'' nn The problem was highlighted in Hollywood 
last summer in a much-discussed incident involving the comedian Dave 
Chappelle and his producer, Peter Tolan, an Emmy award winner, who 
were finishing a sitcom for the Fox network. The pilot had Chappelle, 
who is black, appearing at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on amateur 
night. Fox executives called a meeting and said that though they liked 
the show, they wondered if there wasn't some way to ``broaden its 
appeal.'' It was a chilling moment for Chappelle and Tolan, who took 
that to mean adding more white actors. Peter Roth, then president 
of the Fox network, later acknowledged the request but said it was 
among several things he asked for, and not ``simply about inserting 
white faces into the show.'' Still, Tolan and Chappelle refused, and 
the project was killed. The prime-time schedules of the networks have 
been criticized at times for the lack of diversity in their casts. 
The most successful lineup on television, NBC's Thursday night block 
of comedies, is overwhelmingly white. ``You can't be a Top 10 show 
without a lot of white people watching your show,'' said Andy Borowitz, 
an executive producer of ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' a popular show, 
now off the air, that starred Will Smith. He said had he had faced 
relentless pressure to add white members to its heavily black cast. 
``The knee-jerk response at the network was, maybe we need more cast 
members on the show. They never said white, but, curiously, all the 
characters they proposed were white. They believed a white audience 
wouldn't watch a black show.'' Doug Alligood is a senior vice president 
for special markets at BBDO New York, the advertising agency, and 
a student of white and black viewing patterns. ``It is definitely 
more difficult in prime time to bring whites to black shows than it 
is to bring blacks to white shows,'' he said. ``A show doesn't stand 
a chance once it's labeled a black show. The fact is, fewer and fewer 
shows cross over each year.'' It has not always been this way. In 
the 70s and 80s there were several popular and critically acclaimed 
shows, especially comedies, with largely black or multiracial casts 
and very mixed audiences. The list included shows like ``All in the 
Family,'' ``The Jeffersons,'' ``Sanford and Son,'' ``Maude,'' ``Good 
Times'' and later ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World'' and ``Diff'rent 
Strokes.'' These were shows that, while reflecting some aspects of 
black culture, deliberately set out to appeal to a broad, racially 
mixed audience. By contrast, some of today's black-theme shows are 
regarded as so strongly rooted in black youth culture that they have 
a far narrower appeal. That tradition continues in many kinds of television 
programming today, like sports, where athletes, announcers and audiences 
cross racial barriers. Children's programming, as a matter of course, 
tends to include cast members of several races and attracts mixed 
audiences. But prime time seems to be different. In the first two 
months of the television season, only three shows, none of them comedies, 
ranked in the Top 10 for both white and black households, ``NFL Monday 
Night Football,'' ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``CBS Sunday Movie.'' 
Norman Lear, producer of some of the earlier breakthrough shows, including 
``All in the Family'' and ``The Jeffersons,'' pointed to fierce competition 
from cable channels and dwindling network profits as a reason. ``It's 
all about short-term results; it's all about the bottom line in a 
way it wasn't before,'' Lear said. ``But there are no villains, I 
don't think. Nobody elected for things to go this way. It's grown 
up around us, and the networks feel they have to live with it.'' nn 
The modern worlds of black and white prime time began in the late 
1980s, when the upstart Fox network pursued black audiences because 
there was far less competition in that niche from the major networks. 
Fox produced shows that delved into black street and youth culture, 
attracting a new generation of black writers, producers and actors. 
Many of them then made similar shows for WB and UPN networks, which 
at first followed the same strategy. But now that they have a foothold, 
the three networks have all begun to focus on the more affluent and 
larger white audience. WB, which carries the greatest number of shows 
with black casts, has placed nearly all of them in one Thursday night 
lineup. UPN is about to put most of its black shows together on Tuesday. 
Garth Ancier, president of entertainment for WB, said the black-oriented 
comedies appeared to fare poorly when sprinkled throughout the schedule, 
in part because whites were not tuning in. ``That lack of crossover 
is one of the more confusing things going on right now, and it's troubling,'' 
Ancier said. ``I hope that by doing segregated blocks, we haven't 
enhanced that.'' Ms. Tarses of ABC said her network was trying to 
fight the trend, within bounds. The network consciously developed 
``The Hughleys'' for that reason, she said. ``We wanted an African-American 
show on the air.'' Many black producers hold out marketing as the 
answer. While arguing that ``we should have shows that revel in our 
own culture, definitely,'' Yvette Lee Bowser, a producer who created 
``Living Single,'' formerly on Fox, and ``For Your Love,'' on WB, 
said such shows could still be open to a larger audience. ``I think 
we should not be so narrow-minded as to think that no one from a different 
race should watch those shows, or that they should be marketed just 
to that one group. This industry should not make the assumption that 
because a show has a black cast it is only for black people, but they 
do.'' While a number of black producers pointed out that black music 
frequently reached a crossover audience, several television executives 
said differing economics made it more difficult for black shows to 
do the same and reap profits. Ted Harbert, the former chairman of 
ABC Entertainment and now a producer, said that, compared with record 
albums, television shows cost too much to survive without a very broad 
audience. A sitcom can cost upward of $500,000 an episode, while records 
rarely cost that much to produce. ``Shows that have no crossover appeal 
cost just as much as a show that does,'' Harbert said. Dean Valentine, 
president of UPN, said he was shifting his network's focus away from 
black shows because of these economic realities. ``There had been 
a predominantly black focus here,'' he said. ``There was a very strong 
belief that it was an audience that was underserved in terms of programming. 
As in any business you want to go where there's an underserved audience. 
But I believe you have to broadcast, not narrowcast.'' Asked if the 
networks had to program specifically for one audience or the other, 
Valentine replied, ``I don't think it has to be that way, but it certainly 
is now.'' Television's portrayal of blacks has certainly had its ups 
and downs, from stereotype-laden comedies like ``Amos 'n' Andy'' to 
advances like the late-60s series ``Julia,'' starring Diahann Carroll. 
It seemed to have reached a new stage in 1984 with the premiere of 
``The Cosby Show,'' on NBC. The show, about a family of black professionals, 
the Huxtables, ran for eight years and achieved huge success, attracting 
a multiracial audience, often topping the ratings and spawning another 
successful show, ``A Different World,'' about the Huxtables' daughter, 
going to college and rooming with a white woman. ``The Cosby Show'' 
was criticized in some quarters for depicting a nonrepresentative 
upper-middle-class family, but others argued that it exhibited positive 
values widely held in the black community that were too often overlooked 
on television. (Cosby and his co-star, Phylicia Rashad, are now in 
a CBS sitcom, called simply ``Cosby,'' in which they play a working-class 
couple.) But many blacks feel that the beachhead established by ``The 
Cosby Show'' has been lost. ``It seemed to me that when the show ended, 
the entertainment industry, television in particular, pretended it 
had never happened,'' Ms. Rashad said in an interview. Susan Fales-Hill, 
the executive producer of ``A Different World,'' said her show reflected 
a different era. ``There was a kind of freedom that existed then that 
doesn't exist on the networks now,'' said Ms. Fales-Hill, whose new 
show, ``Linc's,'' about a black bar in Washington, is on the Showtime 
cable channel. Her old show addressed difficult issues like racism, 
the Los Angeles riots, AIDS and perceived bias in the media, she pointed 
out. ``If I pitched that show today, I'd be laughed out of the room,'' 
she said. ``It's a different time.''
