Seventeen people froze to death over the Christmas holiday and weekend, 
for a total of 76 this winter, a police official said Monday. The 
dead were mostly homeless, but a few cases involved drunks who fell 
asleep before reaching home, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy told The Associated 
Press. This is a new record, state-run radio reported. Temperatures 
have dipped to 16-20 below Celsius (plus 5 to minus 4 Fahrenheit) 
in parts of the country since cold weather set in at the beginning 
of December. There are an estimated 30,000 homeless in Hungary.
