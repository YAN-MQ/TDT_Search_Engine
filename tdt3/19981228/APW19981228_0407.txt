Prime Minister Hun Sen slammed the door Monday on growing pressure 
to try two Khmer Rouge leaders and said their defection would be welcomed 
with ``flowers ... not a bullet'' to bring peace to long-suffering 
Cambodia. Khieu Samphan, official leader of the murderous revolutionary 
group, and political chief Nuon Chea would visit Phnom Penh with their 
wives and children Tuesday, Hun Sen said. Military officials promised 
tight security. The government will not force them to face either 
an international tribunal nor a Cambodian court, Hun Sen said before 
a Cabinet meeting. ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit 
the nation, it will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen said. 
``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look toward the future.'' 
The Khmer Rouge leaders remained under wraps in the ex-rebel stronghold 
of Pailin under the protection of former comrades who defected to 
the government in 1996. The pair agreed to defect _ in effect, surrender 
_ in a phone call with Hun Sen on Christmas, 20 years to the day after 
Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia to topple the bloodstained Khmer 
Rouge regime. Hun Sen defied demands that the pair be charged and 
tried for crimes against humanity for the deaths of as many as 2 million 
Cambodians under their rule. ``Should we kill Khieu Samphan or welcome 
him for national reconciliation?'' Hun Sen asked. ``This deal is a 
bouquet of flowers for this pair, not a bullet or a pair of handcuffs.'' 
Over the past two years, the government broke the back of the Khmer 
Rouge by pardoning leaders in exchange for ending the guerrilla war 
that followed their overthrow. The policy brought peace to much of 
Cambodia for the first time in a generation, but with the movement 
now all but extinct, there are new calls for someone to be held accountable. 
Only one leader, the one-legged general, Ta Mok, and perhaps 100 followers 
are still at large. Hun Sen said Monday that he would never accept 
Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher.'' He once said the same of Khieu Samphan 
and Nuon Chea. Pol Pot, the group's leader until losing a power struggle 
to Ta Mok last year, died in April of a heart attack. Hun Sen is a 
former Khmer Rouge field officer who fled bloody purges in 1977 and 
came to power under the decade-long Vietnamese military occupation. 
Critics have long speculated that Hun Sen would never allow a Khmer 
Rouge trial for fear of his own past, but investigators of the genocide 
say there is no evidence he was involved in big atrocities. Hun Sen 
said he had support for the deal from King Norodom Sihanouk and the 
leader of the National Assembly, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. ``This 
is a purely Cambodian solution,'' Hun Sen said. ``We know the right 
medicine to use to cure this problem. If any foreigners try to add 
something, it will never go away.'' In Washington, the U.S. State 
Department noted Sunday that the Cambodian government has repeatedly 
asked for _ and received _ help in bringing top Khmer Rouge leaders 
to justice. ``We trust that no actions will be taken by any party 
that could preclude achieving this goal,'' spokesman Lee McClenny 
said. ``Justice in Cambodia has been long delayed, but must not now 
be denied.'' The opposition Sam Rainsy Party said that victims have 
waited too long for justice and demanded a trial. United Nations legal 
experts recently visited to assess the possibility of creating an 
international tribunal to try Khmer Rouge leaders. Perhaps one Cambodian 
in five perished of disease, overwork, starvation and executions after 
the Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975 and forced the 
population into labor camps. After 30 years of upheaval, many Cambodians 
value peace more highly than trying the killers who once ruled them. 
But the visiting U.N. team raised hopes of justice away from Phnom 
Penh. Hun Sen was dismissive: ``If the wound no longer hurts, we shouldn't 
poke a stick in it and make it bleed.'' Government spokesman Khieu 
Kanharith said talk of a trial was making the defectors afraid they 
would be arrested if they came to Phnom Penh. In Pailin, they are 
relatively safe. Though nominally under government control, the area 
is run by a pardoned former Khmer Rouge chieftain, Ieng Sary. Khieu 
Samphan visited Phnom Penh in 1991, shortly after a peace treaty was 
signed, and was stoned by a government-orchestrated mob. The Khmer 
Rouge eventually broke the treaty.
