And a recent study suggests that some people may actually be addicted 
to loud music. Researchers at North Eastern University in Boston gave 
90 recruits a questionnaire similar to those used to identify alcoholics, 
They translated the question: "Do you feel you are a normal drinker?" 
to, "Do you listen to music at normal levels?" Other questions asked 
respondents if they had ever lost housing or been in trouble with 
the law because of loud music. Of the ninety recruits involved in 
this study, eight were identified as suffering from a disorder the 
study calls, maladaptive music listening. I'm Jane Hughes.
