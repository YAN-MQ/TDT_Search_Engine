And finally this evening, in Miami, an amazing find during what was 
supposed to be a run-of-the mill excavation. Bulldozers began to level 
this site last summer. An old apartment building was to give way to 
high-rise condos. Archaeologists took a routine look. What they saw 
appears to be the remnants of a lost civilization. The tequesta Indians, 
who inhabited what is now downtown Miami, were wiped out by the Spanish 
conquistadors beginning in the 16th century. There is not much evidence 
of their existence left. This circle, carved in the bedrock, scientists 
believe is what is left of the floor of a tequesta temple. We're looking 
at something that is unique, that has never been seen before. This, 
scientists say, is the remains of a five-foot shark, which was deliberately 
buried in the center, suggesting it was an offering to the gods. This 
eye carved in the stone may have been part of a prehistoric calendar. 
Scientists are sifting through every grain of earth looking for clues. 
As of now, they don't have many.
