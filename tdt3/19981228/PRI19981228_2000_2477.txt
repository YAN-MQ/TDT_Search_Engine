No one knows what political problems await the launch of the euro 
this week. But one thing is clear, a potent new European trading entity, 
which some economists are calling Euroland, will be born. Correspondent 
Peter Day offers a mixed forecast. Euroland on Day one, January 1st 
becomes the second-largest economy in the world, twice the size of 
Japan, 3/4 the size of the USA. Euroland becomes the world's largest 
exporter. All kinds of big things. But there are long-term very large 
problems. This a political idea, which is forced on desperate economies 
and may well lead long-term to extreme introversion to perhaps social 
unrest if it doesn't work out. That's the BBC's Peter Day pondering 
the fate of the euro. We will adjourn to Peter and other far-flung 
correspondents for updates on these stories and more in 1999.
