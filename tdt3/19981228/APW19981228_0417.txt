Faced with public outrage, Serbian lawmakers on Monday revoked a much-criticized 
law granting the president and other top officials high salaries, 
paid servants and other privileges. The law was passed in the parliament 
only 20 days ago by neo-Communists and their ultranationalist allies. 
But with Serbia average salary about dlrs 50 a month and unemployment 
approaching about 50 percent, the law triggered outrage among impoverished 
Serbs. Under the law, the Serbian president, government ministers, 
state prosecutors, judges, parliament deputies and some other top 
officials, were supposed to receive salaries 10 to 20 times the national 
average, starting Jan. 1, 1999. The officials would enjoy other privileges, 
such as use of residence, official cars, bodyguards, paid servants 
or administrative clerk. The law was revoked after the government 
``took into consideration critical remarks of the public,'' said a 
statement carried by Tanjug news agency. The government said another 
law on ``rights and obligations'' of the state officials would be 
drafted. The government had defended the law saying it would make 
state officials, such as court judges and government ministers, less 
corrupt by making them richer. Corruption on all levels has taken 
deep root in the Serbian society. Despite growing poverty, President 
Slobodan Milosevic and his government have so far faced little unrest. 
The workers have avoided street protests, fearing reprisals. Critics 
accuse autocratic Milosevic and his aides of accumulating wealth while 
destroying Serbia's economy in the past decade of their rule.
