The situations in Iraq and Washington have been major preoccupations 
this holiday season, that is, unless you ask those who spent today, 
and the last several days, shopping, jamming into stores, malls and 
going online across the country. NBC's Anne Thompson has been out 
among them. The Hunt for bargains may rescue this holiday season for 
retailers. This week after Christmas has become increasingly important 
to retailers. It can make up as much as 10% of their holiday sales. 
Estimates show December sales up anywhere from 3 1/2% to 5%. Good, 
but not great. Experts say shoppers procrastinated, distracted by 
two weeks of warm weather and the desire for discounts. Most people 
waited till just before the Christmas holiday. Between the 14th and 
the 24th, about 45% of sales occurred. And consumers didn't load up 
on traditional items such as coats, gloves and scarfs. This year -- 
buying home furnishings, as home ownership hits an all time high, 
jewelry, thanks to a strong economy, and consumer electronics at record-low 
prices because of the economic crisis in Asia. Prices so good today, 
eloida and melchor Cruz bought a computer for their family. It's a 
good sale. And we've been shopping since before Christmas. So we compared 
from here to there. But money spent here is not being spent elsewhere. 
They're feeling like they're getting better value for the money than 
buying a sweater. And that's what they're buying is consumer electronics, 
instead of sweaters. One reason why traditional retailers, department 
stores that depend on sales of sweaters and coats and winter outerwear, 
are shaping up to be the seasons losers. The winners? Discounters 
such as Wal-Mart, target and Kmart who all did well. Other winners? 
Those companies who sold their goods on the Internet. One survey of 
17 leading online retailers reports revenues up 230% this holiday 
season. The lessons of this Christmas -- convenience and cost savings. 
Two things consumers want and retailers now know they are willing 
to wait for. Anne Thompson, NBC news, Chicago.
