Time for a look at the weather across the country. For that we go 
to WNBC-TV in New York and our friend, meteorologist Janice huff. 
Happy holidays. To you, too. Here in the northeast we have some light 
rain, drizzle and fog. Some of it changing to light snow back in western 
sections of New Jersey into Pennsylvania. But it's pretty weak. Some 
heavy rain has been moving across parts of Florida today. More than 
an inch of rain in west palm beach and a snowstorm continues across 
the northern plains. Wind chill values are in the 25 below zero range. 
Single digits in international falls. You'll be well below zero with 
dangerous wind chills in effect. Temperatures quite chilly across 
most of the country tonight, 30's into the deep parts of the south. 
70's tomorrow across most of Florida into parts of southern Texas. 
Maybe some of that fog will dissipate around Jacksonville. Visibility 
around a quarter of a mile tonight. Tomorrow sunshine in Los Angeles, 
72 degrees. Rainy on the east coast. Boston, 39. Expecting snow over 
northern parts of New England. 45 in our nation's capital. Chicago 
31 and expecting snow. As we shift into new year's eve, check it out. 
Cold air comes south from Canada and starts to spread eastward into 
the northeastern states by Thursday evening with some light snow over 
the Great Lakes. The warm weather continues for Florida all along 
the gulf coast, probably a Little rainy around Austin and Houston, 
Texas. Warm across the southwest. Some sunshine there. Temperatures 
should be well into the 70's. Maybe a few locations close to 80 degrees. 
The pacific northwest will be plagued with rain and snow. The snow 
levels are quite high and should remain that way as mild air moves 
in with the system and still the problem of flooding as well as avalanche 
possibilities in this area so take care here. When the ball drops 
in Times Square Thursday night it looks like temperatures will be 
well below freezing between 15 and 25 degrees. Be there or be square. 
Like an ice cube. Back to you, Brian. Let's hope the heater on that 
car of yours works. Janice huff, thank you very much.
