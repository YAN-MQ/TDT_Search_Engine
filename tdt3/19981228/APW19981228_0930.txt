Georgian guerrillas kidnapped two Abkazhians in the troubled Ghali 
district of eastern Abkhazia, a news agency reported Monday. Ghali 
police chief Beslan Bei said the Georgian Security Ministry had promised 
to help him track down the missing Abkhazians, who were not identified, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said. It was not clear when or why the two 
people were kidnapped. Abkhazian security officials said nine Abkhazians 
are being held hostage in Georgia, ITAR-Tass said. There have been 
frequent clashes in and around Abkhazia, a disputed Georgian region 
that was the site of a 1992-93 war of secession in which Abkhazian 
separatists drove out Georgian government troops. Russian peacekeepers 
have been deployed in the Ghali district since 1994, attempting to 
enforce the terms of the truce that ended the war.
