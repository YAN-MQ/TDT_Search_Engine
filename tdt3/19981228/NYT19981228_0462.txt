Hurd Hatfield, the handsome actor forever identified with the title 
role in the 1945 movie version of Oscar Wilde's novel ``The Picture 
of Dorian Gray,'' died on Dec. 25 at a friend's home in Monktown, 
Ireland. Since the 1970s, he had been living in Rothcormack, Ireland. 
He was 80. Although Hatfield had a long and varied career as a character 
actor onstage and in films, his signature role was Dorian Gray, the 
sensualist who remained eternally youthful while his portrait in the 
attic aged and revealed his decline in graphic detail. The portrait, 
a vision of a decomposed Dorian Gray that appeared as a sudden burst 
of color in a black-and-white movie, was painted by Ivan Albright. 
When Hatfield auditioned for the director Albert Lewin, he began by 
announcing, ``I don't belong here,'' then read a passage from the 
Wilde novel and furiously threw it across the room. His arrogance 
may have helped win the role. The movie also starred George Sanders, 
Donna Reed and Angela Lansbury. After ``Dorian Gray,'' Hatfield was 
often called upon to play villains. Because of his elegant and often 
acerbic manner on and off screen, it was sometimes assumed that he 
was British. Actually, he was born in Manhattan (as William Rukard 
Hurd Hatfield). He began his career with the Dartington Hall company 
run by Michael Chekhov in Britian. In 1952, he appeared on Broadway 
with Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in Christopher Fry's ``Venus Observed,'' 
directed by Laurence Olivier. He often acted in works by Shakespeare, 
playing the title role in ``Julius Caesar'' in the premiere production 
at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., and on Broadway 
he played Don John in John Gielgud's 1959 ``Much Ado About Nothing'' 
He also portrayed Lord Byron and Don Quixote in Elia Kazan's original 
production of Tennessee Williams' ``Camino Real,'' and starred Off 
Broadway in Leslie Stevens' ``Bullfight.'' His films included ``Dragon 
Seed,'' ``Diary of a Chambermaid,'' ``The Left-Handed Gun,'' ``King 
of Kings,'' ``El Cid,'' ``Mickey One'' and ``King David.'' In 1986 
he played the grandfather in the film version ``Crimes of the Heart.'' 
On television he had the title roles in ``The Count of Monte Cristo'' 
and ``Don Juan in Hell'' and was a frequent guest star on Ms. Lansbury's 
``Murder She Wrote.'' No immediate family members survive. In recent 
years, Hatfield toured Germany, Northern Ireland, Russia and Latvia 
in Lawrence and Maggie Williams' play, ``The Son of Whistler's Mother,'' 
a one-man show about James McNeill Whistler. John Cullum had the role 
Off Broadway when the play was titled ``Whistler.'' In July 1997, 
Hatfield made a personal appearance at the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art, in connection with an exhibition of Albright paintings (including 
the artist's picture of Dorian Gray) and a screening of the Hatfield 
movie. ``He was very young-looking until a year ago,'' said Ms. Williams, 
and added that people remembering ``Dorian Gray'' often would ask 
him if he had a portrait of himself in his attic.
