The people who race yachts, big ones all around the world are known 
for their wealth and daring but no amount of money could help them 
with what's been going on off the coast of Australia for the past 
few days during a Race between Sydney and hobart. They call the race 
hell on high water and it turns out with good reason. We have a late 
report tonight from NBC news correspondent Jim Maceda. A dramatic 
rescue on the high seas as one of the world's most prestigious yacht 
races turns tragic. Saturday, 1:00 P.M. Australia time, and 115 yachts 
start a daunting race. It's called hell on high water and begins with 
trouble. Terribly sad situation. A collision at the start. Already, 
gale-force winds tear at the sails. Within minutes, the American entry, 
sayonara, is hurting. They've blown out the corner -- The ship recovers. 
Despite 40-mile-an-hour winds, the race pushes on. But bad weather 
turns unpredictably even worse. Gusts of up to 80 miles an hour. A 
storm can come up and if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time 
it can have grave consequences. Sunday, 3:00 P.M., the Australian 
maritime authority tracks the first distress beacons. Mayday. Winston 
Churchill. Hurricane winds whip up 40-foot waves. By Sunday night 
58 yachts have turned back or capsized. Within hours a massive air 
and sea rescue operation plucks yachtsmen from choppy waters. These 
crewmen lose their skipper and sailor when their yacht is broadsided 
by waves the size of four-story buildings flipping the boat. A 360 
rollover without the mast. That put water in the boat. I'm glad to 
be alive. So was John Campbell. This afternoon, his ship, the kingurra, 
rolls over. He spends 40 minutes treading water near death. I did 
not feel like I was going to be found. I kept up hope, but honestly 
it looked pretty grim. In another tragic incident today, two Australian 
crewmen drowned when this ship capsized. In all five confirmed dead, 
a heavy toll as the winner, the American yacht sayonara, crosses the 
finish line, winning this race is an act of survival. Jim Maceda, 
NBC news.
