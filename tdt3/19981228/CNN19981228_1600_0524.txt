I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Low pressure will be tracking through the upper midwest over the next 
24 hours bringing with it the threat for some snow. Look for another 
stormy day in the pacific northwest. That will last on into tomorrow 
as another area of low pressure moves inland. Snow is expected in 
the northern Rockies. Going to dry out by late tomorrow beginning 
in the southeastern U.S. a Check of temperatures -- only in the teens 
for highs for the remainder of today. Back through the upper midwest, 
ranging into the 80s by the time you make into south Florida. The 
extended forecast -- on Wednesday, snow showers are expected in the 
Great Lakes. Some more heavy rain in the pacific northwest. It could 
find some snow in sections of the northeast. You notice the colder 
temperatures beginning to move in. As we head into Thursday, snow 
showers will be scattered through the Great Lakes. More heavy rain 
into the pacific northwest. Snow as you move inland. And on into Friday, 
on new year's day, we'll find snow showers through the northern Rockies. 
Snow showers will continue as well back through the Great Lakes, and 
much of the northern half of the U.S. will begin to turn much colder.
