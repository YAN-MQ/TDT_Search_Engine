Another right-wing politician in Israel has come forward to challenge 
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu in next year's early elections. 
He's Benny Begin, son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin. The 
BBC's Paul Adams reports from Jerusalem. Benny Begin thinks that Prime 
Minister Netanyahu has gone soft, setting the scene for a Palestinian 
state. At a news conference this morning, Mr. Begin accused the government 
of giving up Jewish land to Palestinian terrorists. Benny Begin is 
an influential right-winger with a reputation for uncompromising views 
and an honest approach. As such, he's likely to attract support from 
hard-liners who are fed up with Benyamin Netanyahu's ambiguous approach 
to the peace process and believe the prime minister has been lying 
to everyone for 2 1/2 years. But Mr. Begin is also a loner. He stands 
little chance of winning the leadership battle. But his defection 
from -- is another blow to Mr. Netanyahu's hopes. Paul Adams, BBC, 
Jerusalem.
