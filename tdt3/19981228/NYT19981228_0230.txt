It's relatively easy to find a label for a policy that involves the 
promise of action. Both ``Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!'' and the more 
temperate ``Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick'' carried messages 
of stern forewarning. Policy slogans beginning with Remember, with 
their pledges of vengeance, had a good run in wartime, with the outrages 
to be recalled ranging from the Alamo to the Maine to Pearl Harbor. 
More recently, containment was George Kennan's somewhat more sobersided 
contribution to Cold War foreign-policy nomenclature, followed by 
the Clinton administration's engagement. These offered a sense of 
quiet but resolute policy action. What do you label a policy that 
does not appeal to jingoism, adventurism, interventionism _ or, indeed, 
commit you to any reaction whatever? Many statesmen find much in a 
philosophy that eschews escalation, arguing instead, ``Don't just 
do something _ stand there.'' That was the challenge that faced Strobe 
Talbott, deputy secretary of state, as he sought a catch phrase to 
define the Clinton administration's foreign policy in a multipolar 
but uni-superpower world. As a former correspondent and columnist 
for Time magazine, Talbott knew that a diplomatic word or phrase had 
to be conceived in quietude, preferably before an academic audience, 
and then be allowed to develop slowly over the months. Any more pretentious 
unveiling, or capitalization, would alert the legion of carping critics 
to strangle the label in its crib. On Sept. 19, 1997, he offered his 
conception to Stanford University: ``We need to make sure we have 
a policy toward Russia that contains an indispensable feature: strategic 
patience. That means a policy not just for coping with the issue or 
the crisis of the moment or the week or even of the season, or for 
getting through the next summit meeting; rather it means a policy 
for the next century.'' Few combinations of words are now wholly original. 
Strategic patience had been used two weeks earlier by a corporate 
executive, Jim Maxmin, in an article for Industry Week; a year before 
that, in ``The Good Guys,'' a book by Jules Bonavolonta and Brian 
Duffy, the phrase was used to describe the FBI plan to infiltrate 
major Mafia families to conduct long-term investigations. Earlier 
hits can be made in databases covering fields from music to the military. 
But after Talbott slipped his diplomatic usage into the bulrushes, 
the Senate's authority on foreign affairs, Richard Lugar, picked it 
up in a January 1998 Harvard speech. ``American policy toward Russia 
must contain a healthy dose of strategic patience,'' he said, accepting 
the Talbott definition, but adding that it was today ``particularly 
susceptible to Russian nonperformance.'' By November, the conceiver 
was ready to incubate the phrase in a speech subtitle. In ``Gogol's 
Troika: The Case for Strategic Patience in a Time of Troubles,'' Talbott 
_ whose enthusiastic support of Boris Yeltsin has been tempered by 
disappointment _ returned to Stanford to say, ``The policy that flows 
from realism is one of strategic patience and persistence.'' Lest 
he be accused of departing from previous policy, he added, ``That 
means continuing engagement.'' After he reworked his thoughtful speech 
for The Economist, his phrase was picked up by his former colleagues 
at Time. Because White House speech writers have chosen no Clinton 
Doctrine or catch phrase of their own and are not really married to 
engagement, Talbott's personal, long-suffering, tactical patience 
has paid off: His phrase is in play. On what linguistic structure 
is this coinage bottomed? (As Henry Kissinger once shouted at a football 
referee who had just made an egregious interference call against a 
Redskins cornerback, ``On vot theory?'') The use of an active modifier 
to qualify a noun that justifies not rushing into action has a grand 
history in diplomatic rhetoric. President Grover Cleveland, criticizing 
the seizure of Hawaii by the United States in 1893, wrote, ``There 
seemed to arise ... the precise opportunity for which he was watchfully 
waiting.'' Twenty years later, President Woodrow Wilson picked up 
that alliterative phrase and, refusing to be drawn into a war with 
Mexico, elevated it to policy status: ``We shall not, I believe, be 
obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting.'' The stern watchful 
gave a monitoring, almost monitory, cast to the feeble waiting. This 
built on the tradition begun in 1791 by Sir James Mackintosh, a historian 
and member of Parliament, in ``Vindiciae Gallicae,'' a response to 
Edmund Burke's criticism of the French Revolution. ``The Commons, 
faithful to their system,'' wrote Mackintosh, ``remained in a wise 
and masterly inactivity.'' That phrase resounded among all who wanted 
to do little or nothing, and was soon followed by his equally stirring 
``disciplined inaction.'' No ringing refutations or derisive slogans 
have yet met Talbott's sophisticated essay into the field of semi-oxymoronic 
phrase making. We will just have to let the dust settle. But those 
sensitive to the technique soon noted another, similar construction 
that offered a corollary to strategic patience. A White House spokesman 
seeking to substitute censure for impeachment used a highly active 
adverb to give backbone to a passive participle: ``Officials publicly 
indicated more interest than before,'' reported The Washington Post, 
``saying they were aggressively listening.'' COMPULSIVE COMPELLING 
``We've made a compulsive, a compelling case,'' opined Henry Hyde, 
House Judiciary chairman. Which did he mean? Both words are rooted 
in the Latin pellere, ``to drive.'' Compel is ``to drive forcefully,'' 
impel is ``to drive with moral pressure'' and propel is ``to drive 
forward.'' Although compelling and compulsive are usually taken to 
be synonyms, the meanings of the two adjectives are differentiating 
usefully. Compulsive, which still means ``having the power to compel,'' 
is being overtaken by its secondary meaning, ``under the psychological 
coercion of obsession.'' One of these days, psychiatrists will adopt 
the verb compulse. Meanwhile, compelling (though its root of compel 
still means ``to force'' or ``to urge irresistibly'') is more often 
being used to mean ``driving toward a conclusion or action by cogent 
argument.'' Hyde meant compelling, I hope.
