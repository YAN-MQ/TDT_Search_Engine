the United Nations Special Envoy in Angola has made an urgent appeal 
to the UNITA rebel movement for help in rescuing any survivors of 
a UN plane that crashed Saturday in UNITA territory. Esa Dialo also 
seeks UNITA assurances of safe passage to the site of the crash for 
UN personnel. UNITA Secretary General says the rebel group has received 
no UN request for aid, and there has been no word on the fate of 14 
people who were on board the UN chartered cargo plane when it went 
down, shortly after taking off, in the central Angolan city of Huambo.
