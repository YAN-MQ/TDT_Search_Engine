Finland's Henna Karolina Raita on Monday was awarded the ``Matteo 
Baumgarten'' prize for her outstanding results as a skier and as university 
student. Raita, a 23-year-old from Lathi who won the women's slalom 
title in the European Cup, was given the 15 million lire (dlrs 9,400) 
award as best skier-student of the year. She was picked by the international 
jury of the prize, named after an Italian student-skier of Bormio, 
the yearly site of a men's World Cup downhill which will also host 
the World Cup finals in 2000.
