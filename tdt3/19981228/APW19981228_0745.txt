Police arrested three Romanians accused of robbing tourists by posing 
as policemen, the state news agency MTI reported Monday. Identified 
only as Daniel D., Maricel S. and Cezar L., the three were taken into 
custody Sunday after police fired a warning shot when the three tried 
to flee. The trio would pose as ``tourist police'' _ there is no such 
thing in Hungary _ and would stop tourists and fine them on a variety 
of trumped up charges. Police had cruised the city in the wake of 
reports of the men's activity, and caught them in the act on the Buda 
side of the Chain Bridge, one of the best known Hungarian landmarks.
