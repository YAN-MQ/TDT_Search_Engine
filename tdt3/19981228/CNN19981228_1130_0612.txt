High winds in Australia are postponing the latest attempt to circle 
the earth nonstop aboard a balloon. The joint Australian/American 
team had hoped to lift off from the australian outback tomorrow, but 
will now try to launch Thursday or Friday. A trio of two balloonists 
and one journalist plan to fly near the edge of space at 130,000 feet. 
The trip should last 18 days.
