What's rated as the world's toughest canoe race is underway in Australia. 
Over a thousand competitors, in all sorts of crafts, have set off 
in the murray river marathon. The six-day trek takes canoeists 250 
miles down the mighty Murray. Unseasonably cold weather and strong 
headwinds already are making the going even tougher. The race is rasing 
money for the red cross. It will end on new year's eve.
