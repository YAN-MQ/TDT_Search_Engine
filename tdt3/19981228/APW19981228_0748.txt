Alexander Lebed, a top prospect to become the next president of Russia, 
has called for a resumption of capital punishment and an end to the 
jury system, a news report said Monday. Lebed also called for extending 
police officers' discretion to shoot to kill, according to an interview 
with the newspaper Izvestia. The article, scheduled for publication 
Tuesday, was quoted by the Interfax news agency. Russia promised to 
eliminate the death penalty in 1996, when it joined the Council of 
Europe, but has so far only enacted a moratorium that prevents courts 
from carrying out capital punishment sentences. ``It is necessary 
to lift the moratorium on capital punishment and expand the sphere 
of its application,'' Lebed said. He conceded that such a move would 
hurt Russia's relations with the Council of Europe, but said that 
the West should welcome Russia's attempts to end rampant crime. Opinion 
polls have consistently shown that most Russians support capital punishment. 
Involvement in organized crime groups should be made a death-penalty 
offense, Lebed said, along with aggravated murder _ the only offense 
of this type that Russia has on the books now. He also called for 
doing away with the jury system and having professional judges hand 
down verdicts on suspects' guilt or innocence, Interfax reported. 
Lebed finished a strong third in Russia's 1996 presidential election 
and is likely to run again in the next presidential election, scheduled 
for 2000. He did a brief stint as Russia's security chief in 1996 
and now serves as governor of the huge Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia.
