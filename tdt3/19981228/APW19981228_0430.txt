Banks halted fresh loans to LG Semicon Co. Monday, accusing it of 
resisting a promised merger that would create the world's second-largest 
computer memory chip maker. President Kim Dae-jung's government wants 
LG Semicon to merge with Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. to cut out 
overlapping investments by the country's computer chip makers and 
boost their competitiveness. Hyundai and LG, the nation's largest 
and third largest conglomerates, agreed in September to merge their 
chip-making subsidiaries. But talks have stalled because of a dispute 
over who should take control of the merged company. The government 
supports a U.S. consulting firm's recommendation that Hyundai become 
the majority shareholder in the new entity. LG says it can not accept 
the recommendation because it was biased in favor of Hyundai. Later 
Monday, LG Semicon's 13 creditor banks, most of them state-controlled, 
held LG responsible for foiling the merger and stopped providing new 
funds to the heavily indebted company. The banks threatened to call 
in LG Semicon's existing loans as well unless it accepts the merger. 
LG Semicon's total debt amounted to 7.48 trillion won (dlrs 6.23 billion), 
mostly owed to banks. About dlrs 3.5 billion of the debt comes due 
within a year. ``LG Semicon must do what it has agreed to do, which 
is very important to its future and credibility,'' President Kim was 
quoted by his spokesman Park Jie-won as saying. With their merger 
talks stalling, LG and Hyundai hired Massachusetts-based Arthur D. 
Little Inc. in November to study who should take control of the new 
company. The consulting firm announced last Thursday it considered 
Hyundai the better choice to run the merged company. LG Semicon is 
preparing to file a lawsuit against Arthur D. Little in a U.S. court 
next month, accusing it of being biased in its month-long research 
and damaging the South Korean company's reputation. The LG-Hyundai 
merger, if realized, would create a company with 17 percent of the 
world memory chip market. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. is 
the largest such company, with a 20 percent global share. South Korean 
conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding during the country's 
boom years, sowing the seeds for the current financial crisis. A typical 
South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50 subsidiaries. President Kim 
is urging the nation's top five conglomerates to merge or swap some 
of their overlapping subsidiaries in auto, semiconductor and other 
key products so that they will focus on core businesses for competitiveness.
