of a Yachting disaster. Gale force winds and high seas turned an annual 
yacht race into a race for survival. Hugh Williams reports. a harrowing 
experience now behind them, the Australian maritime safety authority 
says four crew members from the missing boat, "Winston churchill," 
are now safe, picked up by a rescue helicopter. They are being flown 
to shore for medical treatment. The largest maritime rescue operation 
in Australia continues, after fierce weather hit contestants in the 
annual Sydney to hobart yacht race. Search and rescue officials say 
at least two sailors are known dead. A British sailor was swept from 
the deck of the boat, "sword of Orion," and has been missing since 
Sunday night. Gale-force winds and high seas battered the yachts. 
Race coordinators say more than 27 rescue craft, including coast guard 
and navy planes and ships, and search and rescue helicopters, are 
searching a Wide area of the southeast coast. They have picked up 
at least 50 sailors from their stricken boats. Out of 115 yachts competing 
in the race, 59 have been forced to retire and take Shelter because 
of injuries to crew or damage to their yachts. Five yachts have been 
abandoned. Race director Peter Campbell said it was unlikely the race 
would be called off, as it is up to individual skippers to decide 
whether to continue. The leading yachts are expected to finish in 
hobart Monday evening, while rescue efforts continue to find those 
still missing in the storm. Hugh Williams, for CNN, Brisbane.
