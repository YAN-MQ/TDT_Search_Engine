The associated press news editors poll of the top stories of the year 
is out tonight. And to no one's surprise, the Clinton/Lewinsky mess 
is number one. It and other events over the past year made a number 
of people stars, but very briefly. Look away, and they were gone. 
NBC's Bob Faw tonight. This year they flashed by and then they were 
gone -- Louise woodward, the nanny charged with murder. Al dunlap, 
the boss called "chainsaw." Frank capaci, who won that $104 million 
powerball. William Ginsburg, Monica's attorney, about town and talk 
show. Each had 15 minutes of fame, then seemed to vanish. They get 
their moment. They get their little walk on in the scene. And then 
they disappear. Ask yourself, "whatever happened to Olympic gold medalist, 
Tara lipinski?" To Oprah's film that was to be a blockbuster? Or to 
all those swordfish famous chefs told us in January to boycott? Issues 
and personalities here today, and gone. We have disposable diapers. 
We have disposable razors. And we do have some disposable celebrities. 
In this film, Woody Allen, who should know, said the way we make and 
break celebrities is something very American. We can learn a lot about 
society by who we choose to celebrate. And just what was it we learned 
from that former teacher who volunteered he'd had sex with Monica, 
or from that aspiring actress who volunteered she'd had sex with Mr. 
Clinton? From that Chicago physicist who caused a sensation when he 
said he'd clone humans? Or from that woman who gave birth on the Internet? 
Try to remember any of their names. Clue -- none of them rhymes with 
Joey buttafuoco. There will always be a Joey buttafuoco. There will 
be more Joey buttafuocos. Because what we have done is, we have proliferated 
the number of celebrities we have in our culture. Do you think your 
life will ever be the same? Of course not. The nanny is now back in 
England where she actually attends law school. Monica's consort, Andy 
blieler, still works in the theater. Actress Elizabeth Ward Gracen 
hasn't become a box office sensation. Powerball winner capaci kept 
his lawn mowing job. But no longer carouses with friends who bought 
that winning ticket. They griped when he gave them only $10,000. "Chainsaw" 
Al dunlap got fired and mired in lawsuits. And William Ginsburg, back 
practicing law in Los Angeles, now does comedy for charity. Damn it, 
what am I doing here! Nothing is as perishable as celebrity, said 
the historian. And nothing, perhaps, says more about them and about 
us. Bob Faw, NBC news, Washington.
