The field of candidates for Prime Minster in Israel has become more 
crowded with the entry into the race of Bennie Begin, the son of former 
Prime Minister Menakhem Begin. VOA's David Gullest reports from Jerusalem. 
Menakhem Begin founded the far right Likud party, and his son was 
considered one of its rising stars. But, Bennie Begin announced he 
is bolting Likud to challenge incumbent Likud Chief and Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu as head of a new right wing faction. Mr. Begin 
is a staunch opponent of the Wye River Interim Peace Accord, Mr. Netanyahu 
signed in Washington last October. Heard here through an interpreter, 
he told reporters at a campaign kickoff event, there can be no more 
concessions to the Palestinians. This comes from a tragic understanding 
that this situation will never bring us to peace, or to security. 
Mr. Begin became the fifth candidate to enter the race against Mr. 
Netanyahu, who was forced into early elections when his right-of-center 
coalition fell apart. David Gullest, VOA News, Jerusalem.
