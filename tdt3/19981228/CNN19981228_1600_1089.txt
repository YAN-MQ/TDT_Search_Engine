Attention, investors. You have just a few days left to convert your 
traditional I.R.A. to a new roth I.R.A. you'll have to pay an income 
tax on the conversion, but if you convert by December 31st, you can 
take advantage of a one-time tax break that allows you to pay the 
tax over four years. After the 31st, you can still convert to a Roth 
I.R.A., but you will have to pay the taxes in one lump sum. What are 
the benefits of a Roth I.R.A.? Well, earnings grow tax-free, and you 
can withdraw your money without being penalized under certain conditions.
