Monteverdi's narrative of chivalry, battle and death, ``Il Combattimento 
di Tancredi e Clorinda,'' had its first performance in Venice in 1624. 
Exactly 300 years later, Luigi Nono was born in the same city. But 
those long centuries can seem to collapse into simultaneity when one 
hears the music of these two composers, especially in performances 
as vital as those on two new releases: a pairing of the ``Combattimento'' 
with another of Monteverdi's compact dramas, ``Il Ballo delle Ingrate,'' 
from Rinaldo Alessandrini and his Concerto Italiano (Opus 111, OPS 
30-196), and an anthology of Nono pieces covering the entire 40 years 
of his creative life from Peter Hirsch and the Ensemble United Berlin 
(Wergo, WER 6631). One of Monteverdi's discoveries in ``Il Combattimento'' 
was the thrust that can come from instruments repeating a note, and 
that same thrust is there in the latter part of Nono's ``Canti per 
Tredici'' of 1955, a barrage of ``songs for 13 (instruments).'' Or 
try listening to Nono's ``Canciones a Guiomar'' right after Monteverdi's 
``Ballo delle Ingrate'': There is the same tone of magnificent lament, 
achieved in much the same way, by a slow soprano soaring alone, just 
touching her accompaniment, which in the Monteverdi is scored for 
strings and in the Nono largely for percussion. Or again, the two 
violins of Nono's late ``Hay que caminar'' Sonando speak a language 
of intimate feeling in sound that Monteverdi's violins in ``Il Combattimento'' 
are also enunciating. Writing of the fourth and earliest piece in 
the Nono collection, ``Polifonia _ Monodia _ Ritmica,'' Hirsch offers 
the apt image of ``a song as if over the clatter of weapons.'' He 
might be describing Monteverdi's battle piece. ``Il Combattimento'' 
is a miniature opera of the horse-to-horse and hand-to-hand fight 
between two characters in Tasso's epic ``Jerusalem Freed'': Tancredi, 
a Christian knight, and Clorinda, an infidel whom Tancredi finds, 
in his moment of victory, to be a woman in armor. Their duel has been, 
all along, a metaphor of sexual conquest (though this may be small 
comfort to them), and it has been followed all along by an anonymous 
narrator passionately describing the challenge, the clash of arms, 
the breathless pause, the culminating stroke and the final death. 
The subject of difficult love _ love pulled taut by war, expressed 
in music pulled taut by the constraints of a new creative language 
_ was Nono's also. And for both composers, the expression of that 
love is the more startling for being pure, unsentimental. It asks, 
in the music of both, for a similar pure intensity in performance, 
and its demands here are met. Angelika Luz, in ``Canciones a Guiomar,'' 
and Elisa Franzetti, as Clorinda and the spokeswoman for the ungrateful 
ladies of ``Il Ballo,'' sing with minimal vibrato and maximal keenness. 
They venture forth with complete confidence. Singing of love in a 
time of artistic and armed revolution, Nono found himself in the position 
of the narrator of ``Il Combattimento,'' required to bear witness. 
Both are war correspondents of the emotions, and their uneasy position 
outside the action they describe can be justified only by the closest 
possible attention. Roberto Abbondanza, as Monteverdi's narrator, 
conveys that attention, and he is ably supported in his extreme tempos 
and sudden shifts by Alessandrini's instrumental ensemble. This is 
an exciting account of an exciting piece. ``Il Ballo delle Ingrate'' 
_ an ironic court entertainment, written for a marriage and showing 
the luckless fate in hell of love-spurning ladies _ is less continuously 
gripping, but equally well done. As for Nono's attention, Hirsch and 
his team speak loudly for it. There have been a lot of Nono releases 
since the composer's death in 1990. This is one of the best.
