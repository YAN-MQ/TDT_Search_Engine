Mentor Graphics Corp., the maker of software for work stations, has 
raised its unsolicited takeover bid for Quickturn Design Systems to 
$14 a share in cash, matching the price offered by a rival, Cadence 
Design Systems Inc. If the offer, which is set to expire on Jan. 11, 
is accepted, Mentor would seek only 14.9 percent of Quickturn's stock, 
the maximum amount it said could be owned without setting off a poison 
pill defense. Quickturn said on Monday that its board was studying 
the offer and urged shareholders not to act until it had made a recommendation. 
Mentor, which made its first hostile offer in August, is still seeking 
to negotiate a deal with Quickturn to buy the rest of the shares for 
the same cash price. Quickturn, which is based in San Jose, Calif., 
and sells specialized computers that can emulate a new chip before 
it exists in silicon, has rebuffed Mentor's advances before. Mentor 
earlier this year proposed a friendly transaction, but that deal was 
rejected. So on Aug. 12, Mentor offered shareholders $12.125 a share 
in cash in an unsolicited bid for Quickturn. The value of the deal 
then totaled $209.5 million for the 97 percent of the company's shares 
Mentor did not already own. But within two weeks Quickturn rejected 
the offer. The company's president, Keith R. Lobo, said the offer 
came ``at a moment of weakness for Quickturn's stock price and a moment 
of desperation for Mentor's design-verification strategy.'' Quickturn 
soon found another partner. On Dec. 8, Cadence Design Systems agreed 
to acquire Quickturn in a stock swap valued at $14 a share, or $253 
million. Cadence, also based in San Jose, and Mentor, based in Wilsonville, 
Ore., are rivals in the market for the software used to make computer 
chips. Mentor responded by suing Quickturn and its board, saying Quickturn 
breached its fiduciary duties by neglecting to wait for a higher offer 
from Mentor. Mentor's president and chief executive, Walden C. Rhines, 
said on Monday that ``there has not been much cooperation by the management 
of Quickturn,'' although the sweetened offer is his company's first 
step to completing a merger. Any combination with a company other 
than Cadence would be expensive for Quickturn, which must pay Cadence 
$17.58 million in breakup fees if that merger is called off. To further 
complicate matters, Mentor and Quickturn have been locked in a patent 
litigation battle. Mentor last year acquired a small French company 
that offers a product similar to Quickturn's but cannot market the 
product in the United States. The International Trade Commission ruled 
that Mentor was infringing on a series of Quickturn patents, and the 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected Mentor's appeal.
