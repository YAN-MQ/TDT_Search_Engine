A sinking ship and an asteroid trip helped Hollywood to a record year 
at the box office. Movies earned nearly $7 billion in north America 
this year. Attendance was up by more than 5%. "Armageddon" was the 
year's top grossing film, earning $202 million. Ironically, the 1997 
movie, "Titanic," helped the 1998 box office by pulling in $488 million 
this year.
