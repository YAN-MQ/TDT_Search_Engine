In what may be the biggest one-day purge in NFL history, five coaches 
were fired Monday less than 24 hours after their seasons ended. One-sixth 
of the league's coaches were dismissed: Ray Rhodes of Philadelphia, 
Dom Capers of Carolina, Ted Marchibroda of Baltimore, Dave Wannstedt 
of Chicago and Dennis Erickson of Seattle. With the exception Erickson, 
who was three time zones away, word of four of the firings came within 
an hour. ``I think it's disgusting. Some of the better coaches in 
the NFL got fired today,'' said Miami's Jimmy Johnson, a close friend 
of Wannstedt, who was his defensive coordinator in Dallas. ``I know 
we're highly paid, but it's a shame when coaches' jobs are dependent 
on injuries, skyboxes, people in the stands and officiating calls. 
... It doesn't give me a good feeling about our profession when I 
see things like I saw this morning.'' At least one owner seemed to 
agree that firing the coach is a way to address mistakes made by many 
others. ``In hindsight there would be a lot of things that we didn't 
get done as well as we wanted to,'' Carolina owner Jerry Richardson 
said. ``I'm not dumping it all on Dom.'' Chicago owner Mike McCaskey, 
whose team finished 4-12 the last two seasons under Wannstedt, seemed 
to confirm what Johnson was saying. ``It hurts to see empty seats, 
people who've already paid for those seats choosing not to show up,'' 
he said. All the fired coaches knew what was coming or sensed it long 
before the dismissals were announced. In fact, this may have been 
a record day in a record year _ there could be as many as 10 or 11 
vacancies this year, approaching the 11 new coaches after the 1996. 
There was one common denominator in the firings: All the coaches had 
losing seasons except Erickson, who was 8-8 this year for the third 
time in four seasons in Seattle despite millions spent on free agents. 
``We are 3-13,'' Rhodes said in the days leading to his firing. ``A 
new coach will be in here shortly.'' And a lot of other places as 
well. There already are seven vacancies: Monday's five, plus the expansion 
Cleveland Browns and San Diego, where June Jones, who replaced Kevin 
Gilbride in midseason, has chosen to take the job at the University 
of Hawaii rather than take a shot at the permanent job with the Chargers. 
There will be more. Norv Turner in Washington is on shaky ground and 
Cincinnati's Bruce Coslet may be as well. Also, the Mike Holmgren 
scenario won't be played out until Green Bay is eliminated from the 
playoffs _ the Packers' coach is free to pursue a head coach-general 
manager slot and would be the first choice of almost everybody. And 
San Francisco's Steve Mariucci still hasn't signed a contract extension 
because he's unsure about the team's future with Carmen Policy and 
Dwight Clark now running the new Browns in Cleveland.
