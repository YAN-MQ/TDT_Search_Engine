A long and frustrating season for Cruzeiro finally ends Tuesday when 
the team faces Palmeiras in the third and deciding game of soccer's 
Mercosur Cup. After a grueling schedule of 80 games and heartbreaking 
losses in the finals of Brazil's two biggest tournaments, this is 
Cruzeiro's last chance to win a major title this year. ``We're in 
a process of intense physical and psychological decline,'' Cruzeiro 
coach Levir Culpi said. ``The players are starting to lose their edge.'' 
They'll try to hold it together for one more game, long enough to 
salvage the elusive title. ``It's sad to think we still have a game 
to play, two days away from 1999,'' said midfielder Valdir. ``Ninety 
more minutes and the season is over.'' It could have been over on 
Sunday. Cruzeiro, a 2-1 winner in the first-leg game, needed only 
a tie to win the first Mercosur Cup. But Palmeiras came from behind 
for a 3-1 victory to force a third game. The momentum now seems to 
be with Palmeiras, which again will play before its raucous hometown 
fans. Eliminated from the Brazilian national championship by Cruzeiro 
in the quarterfinals, Palmeiras has worked off the rust from two weeks 
of idleness and is again the feared ``Green Machine.'' With a star-laden 
roster and a deadly air game, Palmeiras shrugged off a quick goal 
by Cruzeiro and dominated Sunday's game. All-stars Oseas, Paulo Nunes, 
Alex and Junior Baiano took turns bedeviling the Cruzeiro defense. 
The only doubt for Tuesday is star fullback Cleber, who was injured 
Sunday. If he can't play, Aguinaldo or Roque Junior will start, Coach 
Luiz Felipe Scolari said. Cruzeiro, which sagged visibly in the second 
half Sunday, also must find replacements for key starters. Injured 
fullback and team captain Wilson Gottardo, who played only one period 
Sunday, was listed as doubtful. Playmaker Djair was under examination 
for a suspected ankle fracture, while striker Fabio Junior complained 
of a twisted knee. A loss on Tuesday would crown a year of near-misses 
for Cruzeiro. The team lost the final of the Brazil Cup to Palmeiras 
and came up short in a riveting three-game final of the Brazilian 
national championship, won by Corinthians. The losses cost Cruzeiro 
a berth in next year's Libertadores Cup, which it won in 1997. The 
game starts at 9:40 p.m. local time (2340 GMT) on Tuesday at Parque 
Antartica stadium.
