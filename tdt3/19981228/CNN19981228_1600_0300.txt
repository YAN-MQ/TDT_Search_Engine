Thick fog has been detaining holiday travelers in the San Francisco 
bay area. Flights were delayed up to three hours yesterday. Visibility 
was down to 100 feet at San Francisco airport this morning. Inside, 
passengers stood in long lines at ticket counters. The fog wasn't 
expected to burn off until late this morning, causing more delays 
through the day.
