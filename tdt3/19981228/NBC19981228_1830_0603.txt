In the pacific northwest, post holiday travelers have met with every 
kind of bad winter weather you can name. A huge low pressure system 
has brought rain, fog, snow, ice, high winds and all the attendant 
travel disasters, with roads and airports closed. At the same time, 
California's citrus farmers are trying to figure out what to do with 
their own weather problem, a deep freeze that's ruined their crops. 
We have two reports tonight, beginning with the travel nightmare in 
the northwest. Here's NBC's Mike Boettcher. East of Seattle, heavy 
snow forces the closure of two major mountain passes blocking interstate 
90 for 24 hours. If it doesn't open soon, I'll go back home. Thousands 
of holiday motorists who thought they were going home went nowhere, 
sleeping in their cars until this afternoon when the roads were finally 
reopened. Hotel rooms were at a premium. People said they'd give me 
$30 if they could sleep in the lobby. Along the Washington coastline, 
strong winds knocked out power to 25,000, and heavy rain triggers 
mudslides, one sends a house sliding into puget sound. When we started 
hearing the noise, we grabbed the kids and ran out on the beach. We 
figured it was the safest place to be. Rivers across western Washington 
are rising. Many are expected to flood in the next two days. Thousands 
have been told to prepare to evacuate. We'll evacuate up the street 
about a mile to the church. And the situation is only expected to 
get worse. Heavy rains are predicted tonight and tomorrow, extending 
from Washington into Oregon. I'm sorry, but the highway is closed. 
Flooding already has closed several roads and mudslides have added 
to the chaos. What can you do about it? It just happens. Flying presented 
problems, too. All major airports in the San Francisco bay area, closed 
because of fog. One united flight to San Francisco ended up in Denver. 
They came on the loudspeaker and said, "I'm sorry, we have some bad 
news." Your flight to San Francisco is canceled. We're stopping at 
Denver. With a series of storms poised off the pacific northwest coast 
tonight, more rain will bring only more bad news. Mike Boettcher, 
NBC news, Seattle.
