This was a Monday unlike most Mondays for Bill Parcells. There were 
no signs of exhaustion after a night of tossing and turning. Instead 
there was an upbeat air surrounding the Jets coach. This was a proud 
moment for Parcells, who reflected on a season that he hoped is far 
from over. Sunday's 31-10 victory over the Patriots _ the Jets' third 
straight against his former team _ did not change the team's playoff 
position (a bye week followed by a home-field game on Jan. 10). But 
the dominating performance elevated the club's confidence and continued 
to show Parcells that it is becoming a matured, battle-hardened group. 
So Parcells gave the players three days off before they are summoned 
on Thursday. But he warned them not to celebrate on New Year's Eve 
because there will be practice on Friday. The regular season is over, 
the playoff run has begun. When someone mentioned the words Super 
Bowl, Parcells said: ``It's in the back of your mind. That's the prize.'' 
This season marked the third time Parcells has led a woebegone team 
he inherited into the playoffs in only his second season. The first 
stint was with the Giants in 1983, followed by the Patriots in 1993. 
But he has no favorites, he suggested, even though he continued to 
talk about the Jets in terms he rarely has used after only two seasons. 
``I can't imagine anything that will serve us better than the last 
four games _ on the road, comebacks, a game that people said didn't 
matter,'' Parcells said. ``There is no game you're not trying to win.'' 
In those last four games, the Jets beat Seattle, Miami, Buffalo and 
New England. ``We had to come back against Seattle,'' Parcells said. 
``We had to go on the road to tough places, to Miami and to Buffalo.'' 
And referring to the regular-season finale, against New England, he 
said: ``We had to sustain the energy even though a lot of people were 
saying it is not that important. And we did it.'' But was this Jets 
team more satisfying than the others? Is there a common denominator? 
``I don't know, unless it's gathering the right kind of players for 
the coaching staff,'' he said. ``You give the players a good design 
and then get them to execute it. It's not just simple preparation, 
it's working out, the conditioning program, getting them ready all 
the time. If they don't do it, they have no chance. It doesn't mean 
you won't get it done over the course of four or five games, but I 
told this group, `If you don't do it all the time, you have no chance.' 
'' He said that his first playoff appearance with the Patriots was 
a proud moment. They had started the season 3-6, they were trailing 
the Vikings at halftime by 21-3 in Game 10 and they came back to win 
their last seven games. If he knew back in 1983 with the Giants what 
he knows now, he said, ``I don't think I would have had as much wasted 
energy. You're not set in your ways.'' He pointed out that he knew 
in advance last week how much the Jets would practice for the Patriots 
since his team had played the previous Saturday. He is able to maximize 
scheduling based on his experience. Despite the perception that he 
was held back in personnel decisions under George Young with the Giants 
and the Patriots' owner Robert K. Kraft, Parcells contends, ``I never 
felt constrained in either of my jobs. With the Giants we picked up 
players I wanted _ Dave Duerson, Everson Walls _ and at New England 
we got Keith Byars in the middle of the season, Jerome Henderson, 
Otis Smith. By and large, wherever I was I never felt limited in that 
respect.'' Of course, here Parcells' title is head football coach 
and chief football operations officer _ and that only hints at the 
power and influence he wields over the Jets, through every square 
foot of the offices as well as the artificial turf.
