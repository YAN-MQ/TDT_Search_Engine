There will be no more negotiations, tweaking of deals or give and 
take. No trap doors or escape hatches. This was Monday's message from 
David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association. 
Stern spent the day suggesting that the players should vote on the 
owners' final offer, which was presented on Sunday, and he challenged 
anyone to discredit the offer as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. 
Trying to shift the burden to Billy Hunter, the union's executive 
director, Stern made it clear in often prickly and acerbic tones that 
the only way to salvage the season would be for Hunter to accept the 
proposal and prevent an owners' vote on Jan. 7 that could leave the 
league as the first major professional sport to cancel an entire season. 
In rejecting the offer on Sunday, Hunter said he believed there was 
still room for movement, still time to talk. He has chosen not to 
put the matter to a vote by the players and continues to doubt the 
doomsday scenario that has been depicted by Stern and Russ Granik, 
Stern's deputy. In a joint conference call Monday with Granik. Stern 
derided Hunter, saying: ``He didn't believe that the NLRB would dismiss 
the unfair labor practice, and he didn't believe Dean Feerick would 
not side with them, and he didn't believe the owners would lock out, 
and he didn't believe we would lose regular-season games, and he didn't 
believe that we would miss Christmas Day, and he didn't believe we 
would cancel the All-Star Game.'' ``So his analysis of this is right 
on target,'' Stern added. ``So he'll leave it, once more, for the 
fate of 415 players, most of whom have worked together with this league 
for the last number of years to get it to where it is. And on Jan. 
8, he'll turn to his players and say: `Guess what? I was wrong.''' 
Then Granik continued, ``Or maybe he'll say, `Gee, maybe they didn't 
mean it on Jan. 7.' But by then, it will be too late.'' But Hunter 
was not blinking Monday. He said he would not put the owners' proposal 
to a vote and maintained that the two sides are too close and the 
stakes are too high for a cataclysm. ``If you look at it objectively, 
there's no question that our players would suffer,'' Hunter said in 
a conference call of his own. ``By the same token, I don't think that 
the NBA owners are prepared to blow up something that they've spend 
56 years building. Now, they may, out of arrogance and power, they 
may thumb their nose at us and cut off their heads to spite their 
face. But the reality is, the downside is so great, that I don't know 
if the NBA would ever recover. ``You have 29 franchises that in the 
aggregate are worth probably $5 billion to $6 billion, so are you 
going to jeopardize your $6 billion investment and the upside to that 
particularly when we're so close at the table? And over a few million? 
When you say the downside is severe for us, it's just as severe and 
grave for the owners. They may be independently wealthy and may be 
able to survive it, but I don't think they'll be able to put the league 
back together.'' Stern and Granik acknowledged that the NBA would 
be a far humbler and much different league if the season is canceled 
_ some stars would be gone and ticket prices may be lower and television 
deals might change _ but that the league would live to entertain again. 
Although the league will mail out its new proposal, neither Stern 
nor Granik were optimist that the season could be saved unless Hunter 
and the players' 19-member negotiating committee performed an about-face 
and presented the current deal to the union for a vote. In a conference 
call with the players negotiating committee Monday, Hunter said they 
were unanimous in their agreement that the owner's proposal was not 
a good enough deal to present to their members. Hunter said he was 
convinced that at least 80 percent of the union's 400-plus members 
would vote against the current proposal. Some players are not so sure 
there would be a lop-sided outcome. As former union president Buck 
Williams said, ``I think it would be tight, right down the middle.'' 
Other players, like Karl Malone, have called the owners' offer fair. 
``We have been given the trust by the players,'' Hunter said. ``And 
we intend to exercise that.'' The players' negotiating committee, 
led by president Patrick Ewing, contains a cross-section of players 
but is a group that has been criticized for its attachments to agents 
like David Falk. Four of its most prominent members, Ewing, Alonzo 
Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo and Juwan Howard are Falk clients. This 
core has left league officials to wonder if they have the best interest 
of the masses at heart. Although the league improved its offers in 
the area of revenue shares, maximum salaries, salary-cap exceptions, 
the rookie scale and minimum wages, the union says the numbers are 
workable but feels handcuffed by the elimination of opt-out clauses, 
the disappearance of guaranteed licensing fees and the loss of Bird 
rights _ which allow teams to re-sign players for whatever amount 
_ for players in the last years of their contracts. But Hunter is 
certain that if the negotiating committees _ both for the owners and 
players _ can huddle in the same room before Jan. 7 that a deal can 
get done to save the season. ``There's a strong possibility an agreement 
can be reached,'' Hunter said. ``We've done everything that we believe 
is conceivable.'' Stern and Granik sound anything but inclined to 
meet with the union again. ``We don't anticipate any further negotiations,'' 
Stern said. ``We have nothing left to give. If the players have something 
to tell us, we'll take it back to our labor committee, but the likelihood 
is that the season will be canceled on Jan. 7.''
