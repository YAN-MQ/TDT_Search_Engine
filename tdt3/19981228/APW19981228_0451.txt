Faced with a continuing NBA lockout, Charlotte Hornets center Vlade 
Divac decided to join Yugoslav champion Red Star in the Euro basketball 
league, the Belgrade team officials said Monday. Divac, who like many 
other locked out NBA stars is seeking to play in Europe, will start 
for Red Star in the Euro League match against Zalgiris, Lithuania, 
in Belgrade on Jan. 7. He will face Portland Trail Blazers center 
Arvydas Sabonis who joined the Lithuanian team for the remainder of 
the lockout, said Red Star manager Vojislav Stojakovic. Divac, who 
signed for LA Lakers in 1989 and played the last two seasons with 
the Charlotte Hornets before becoming a free agent, confirmed he was 
joining Red Star. Divac, a Yugoslav, told the daily newspaper Politika 
that he had rejected a much better financial offer to play for Kinder 
Bologna, and opted for the Belgrade team for patriotic reasons. Politika 
said that Divac and Red Star agreed that he could return to the NBA 
as soon as the lockout ended.
