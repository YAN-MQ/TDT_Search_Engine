The dual situations playing out in Iraq and Washington have been major 
preoccupations this holiday season that is unless you ask those who 
spent today shopping. That means jamming into stores, malls and web 
sites. NBC's Anne Thompson has been out among them. The Hunt for bargains 
may rescue this holiday season for retailers. The week after Christmas 
has become increasingly important to retailers. It can make up to 
10% of their sales. Estimates show December sales up 3.5% to 5%, good 
but not great. Experts say shoppers procrastinated distracted by warm 
weather. Most people waited until just before the Christmas holiday 
between the 14th and 24th. And consumers didn't load up on traditional 
items such as coats, gloves and scarfs. This year buying home furnishings 
as home ownership hits an all-time high. Jewelry thanks to a strong 
economy, and consumer electronics at record low prices because of 
the economic crisis in Asia. Prices so good, today eloida and melchor 
Cruz bought a computer for their family. It's a good sale, and we've 
been shopping since before Christmas. So, we compare prices from here 
to there. But money spent here is not being spent elsewhere. They're 
feeling like they're getting better value for their money than a Sweater. 
That's what they're buying, consumer electronics. One reason traditional 
retailers, department stores that depend on sales of winter clothing 
are shaping up to be this season's losers. The winners -- discounters 
such as Wal-Mart and target, all did well. Other winners, though companies 
that sold their goods on the Internet. One survey of 17 on-line retailers 
reports revenues up 230% this holiday season. The lessons of this 
Christmas -- convenience and cost savings. Two things consumers want 
and retailers now know they are willing to wait for. Anne Thompson, 
NBC news, Chicago.
