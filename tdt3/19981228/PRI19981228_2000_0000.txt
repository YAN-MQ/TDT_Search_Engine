It's Monday, December 28th. I'm Lisa Mullens in Boston. Today, US. 
fighter planes retaliate against Iraqi missiles in Iraq's no-fly zone. 
President Clinton calls the attack appropriate. Iraq calls it evil 
and aggressive. When will NATO arrest the two most wanted Bosnian 
war crime suspects? One analyst says now is the time. The bottom line
