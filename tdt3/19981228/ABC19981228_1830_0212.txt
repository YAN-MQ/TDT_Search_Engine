From coast to coast today, the weather is making people miserable. 
In the pacific northwest, thousands of people are stuck with no place 
to go. A disastrous combination of rain, snow, floods and mudslides 
is making for one of the worst holiday travel seasons in years. ABC's 
Brian Rooney reports from Seattle. As snow piled up in the mountain 
passes, so did the cars and trucks. Hundreds of drivers spent the 
weekend waiting for blocked mountain passes to open. Lots of reading 
material and a thermos full of coffee. Last year was easy. This year's 
been worse. This was the fifth winter storm to hit the northwest so 
far this season, which, to date, has been twice as wet as the normal 
winter. The reason -- blame it on La Nina, the weather phenomenon 
which is the flip side of last year's El Nino. The ocean cools down 
and the jet stream moves right over the northwest dumping rain and 
snow. Historically that has created wetter-than-normal winters in 
western washington, and so far, this has been following the pattern. 
The snow was followed almost immediately by a warmer front that brought 
rain, sludge and rising rivers. The Gates of some flood control dams 
have been opened wide allowing water to cascade downstream. We could 
see major flooding in the next couple of days. Near Tacoma, a mudslide 
pushed a home off its foundation, almost into puget sound. Highway 
30 outside of Portland, Oregon, was cut by rushing water. Sandbagging 
is likely to be a common sight in the northwest this winter. A new 
storm is rolling in, and the national weather service says this is 
the way it is likely to be in the northwest right through the month 
of april. Brian Rooney, ABC News, Seattle.
