In the third challenge to Benjamin Netanyahu from a scion of his Likud 
party, the only son of Menachem Begin on Monday declared his candidacy 
for prime minister. Benny Begin's candidacy underscored the prime 
minister's growing isolation in the party his father once led, although 
the younger Begin lacks popular appeal. Another Likud breakaway, former 
Finance Minister Dan Meridor, is running for prime minister on a centrist 
slate. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Communications Minister 
Limor Livnat, are debating whether to leave the Likud, possibly to 
join Meridor. Netanyahu is also being challenged from within the party 
by Uzi Landau, a hard-liner who, like Begin, opposes ceding further 
lands to the Palestinians. Landau has little chance, but it is practically 
unheard of for a sitting prime minister to be challenged within his 
party. Netanyahu denied that his support within the party was collapsing. 
``The party is very solid and very unified around the direction we 
have taken to bring Israel peace and security,'' he said Monday, a 
day after the Likud rank and file cheered him as ``King of Israel'' 
at a meeting of the party's central committee. Yet on Monday, his 
government failed to garner enough legislators to pass an ancillary 
bill necessary to allow passage of a budget bill. Two members of the 
coalition abstained and others _ including senior Likud figures _ 
were absent from the chamber. Netanyahu agreed to early elections 
last week when he could not get a majority in parliament to back his 
security policies. Likud hard-liners were outraged that he agreed 
to cede more territory to the Palestinians at U.S.-brokered talks 
in Wye River, Md. in October. Doves are exasperated with Netanyahu 
for freezing Wye soon after the agreement, for what he says were Palestinian 
violations. All sides attack him for equivocating and lacking leadership. 
Meridor has described Netanyahu's 2 1/2 years as prime minister as 
``the collapse of leadership and political culture.'' On Monday, two 
former prime ministers from opposing camps, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak 
Shamir, jointly appealed to the Knesset to repeal direct elections 
for the prime minister, a system introduced in the 1996 elections 
that helped the telegenic Netanyahu to power. Begin, Livnat, Landau 
and Meridor are all children of the ``fighting family'' _ the men 
and women who founded the Revisionist movement in the 1930s, that 
counted out any compromise with the Arabs. Yet, in 1978, it was the 
late Menachem Begin _ the first Likud prime minister _ who agreed 
to cede land for peace, signing over the Sinai peninsula to Egypt. 
But he refused to concede territory in the West Bank, part of the 
biblical land of Israel, and committed only to limited autonomy for 
the Palestinians, with full Israeli military control. The younger 
Begin _ a wiry, sharp-tongued, geologist _ resigned from his position 
as science minister in Netanyahu's Cabinet after Netanyahu agreed 
to pull troops out of the West Bank town of Hebron in January, 1997. 
``The reality is before us,'' Begin said, announcing his candidacy. 
``No peace, no security.'' Although Begin's chances of becoming prime 
minister are remote _ he could not name a single legislator who backed 
him _ he could weaken Netanyahu by splitting the hard-line vote and 
forcing a second round. Netanyahu said Monday that support at the 
grassroots level would win him victory at the polls this spring. ``The 
majority of citizens identify with what we've been doing ... with 
our firmness on security, because they understand these are the things 
that make a real peace process,'' he said. Netanyahu is resisting 
holding elections before May 4, the date by which Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat has pledged to unilaterally declare statehood. A Palestinian 
negotiator suggested Monday that Arafat would not go through with 
the declaration if it would help Netanyahu get re-elected. The Palestinians 
have accused Netanyahu of making excuses to get out of his promises. 
``The political leadership will decide on the issue of the declaration 
of the Palestinian state in accordance with the national interests 
of the Palestinian people,'' Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian negotiator, 
told The Associated Press. During a Likud Central Committee meeting 
Sunday night, Netanyahu said reports that Arafat would back off the 
May 4 declaration was proof that the opposition Labor party was colluding 
with Arafat in order to topple him. Labor Party leader described that 
as ``incitement'' typical of Netanyahu's political style.
