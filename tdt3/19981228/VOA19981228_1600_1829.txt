The Iraqi News Agency says its anti-aircraft defenses have shot down 
what it calls an enemy airplane. But in Washington, US Defense Department 
officials are strongly denying that any plane was shot down. Earlier 
Monday, US warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern Iraq 
fired missiles at an Iraqi air defense site. VOA's Jim Randall reports. 
Pentagon officials say no US or other coalition planes were lost in 
the incident. They say it began when at least three surface to air 
missiles rose to meet US F-15s and F-16s. Officials say the planes 
fired missiles that honed in on Iraqi radar facilities and also dropped 
precision guided bombs. US experts say the attacks appear to have 
damaged the Iraqi targets. News reports from Baghdad say four Iraqi 
soldiers died and seven more were hurt in the exchange of missiles. 
US and British warplanes patrol large parts of Iraq to prevent Baghdad's 
attacks on Kurds in the north, and Shiite Muslims in the south. US 
officials say pilots are permitted to defend themselves if they are 
threatened by missiles, gunfire or certain kinds of radar. Jim Randall, 
VOA News, at the Pentagon.
