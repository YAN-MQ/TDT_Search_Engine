South Africa is investigating allegations that millions of condoms 
being supplied to tackle the spread of AIDS are faulty. South Africa 
has the fastest-growing AIDS epidemic in the world. The BBC's Jane 
Stanley reports from Johannesburg. Ninety-five percent of the nearly 
200 million condoms used in South Africa every year are bought by 
the Minister of Health, using -- systems which are, allegedly, so 
inadequate that they're practically an invitation to manufacturers 
to dump faulty and poor-quality goods. In a test of condoms handed 
out free to prostitutes in Cape Town, nearly a quarter were split 
or perished. The scandal is a blow to a new campaign by the South 
African government to promote condom use. They're not very popular 
and AIDS is claiming 1500 new infections every day. Jane Stanley in 
Johannesburg.
