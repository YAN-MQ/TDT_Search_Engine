As part of Europe's defense integration, Britain's General Electric 
Co. PLC said Monday that it will resume merger talks in the new year 
with three potential partners, U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin, 
French electronics group Thomson-CSF and British Aerospace. Company 
spokesman Peter Craine said that an announcement about the future 
of GEC, which is unrelated to the U.S. industrial giant General Electric 
Co., would be made ``as soon as we have brought one of our sets of 
negotiations to a close. It is not entirely within our hands.'' In 
January, analysts say that defense contractors throughout Europe's 
NATO nations are expected to agree a series of consolidation mergers, 
following the trend in the United States. ``This is a process which 
is moving forward quite fast in the industry. The person who moves 
first has the most choices, certainly in Europe,'' said Craine. Earlier 
this month, newspapers in Britain speculated that GEC would finally 
merge with British Aerospace, creating a dlrs 39 billion defense group. 
Such an alliance would be the first big-scale union in the European 
defense industry. On Monday, the London-based Financial Times newspaper 
quoted Thomson-CSF chairman as saying that the French government had 
given its backing to a merger with Marconi Electronics, GEC's defense 
arm, and had agreed to lower its stake in the French company. To maintain 
flexibility, GEC has said it will consider a merger with its civil 
or defense businesses, or both. Marconi Electronics makes computer 
displays for U.S. F-16 fighters, and the European Tornado fighter-bomber 
and Eurofighter. It also has a maritime division that makes torpedoes 
and sonar. In 1999, the Financial Times said it is forecast to have 
operating profits of 430 million pounds (dlrs 690 million) on sales 
of about 5 billion pounds (dlrs 8 billion). ``I have had intense and 
successful discussions with the French government that make me fully 
convinced that if such a deal is presented to it conditional upon 
a significantly reduced government holding, there will be no problem 
on its part,'' the newspaper quoted Denis Ranque as saying. The French 
government holds a 40 percent share in the company, the newspaper 
said, but would reduce this to below 10 percent to complete a merger 
with GEC. The newspaper said that in a merger between the two firms, 
Thomson, valued at 3.8 billion pounds (dlrs 6.1 billion) would likely 
be the junior partner. ``The French option still actively under discussion,'' 
said Craine. Craine said other firms with which GEC held talks, such 
as U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp., could become involved 
in talks again. ``Once we get into active negotiations again, we might 
find the list changes,'' Craine said. On Dec. 22, GEC said it would 
separate its civil and defense businesses, and on the 23 the company 
announced a 50-50 joint venture with Italy's Finmeccanica to combine 
their ground, naval, missile system and air traffic control activities. 
The new company is to be called Alenia Marconi Systems, with annual 
revenue of about dlrs 1.7 billion. The companies said the venture 
will be the major supplier of missile systems outside the United States.
