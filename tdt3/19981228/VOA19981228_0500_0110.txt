Foreign ministers from five West African countries meet today in Abidjan 
Ivory Coast to discuss the growing crisis in Sierra Leone. The meeting 
follows heavy fighting over the weekend around McKenny, a key city 
in Northern Sierra Leone. The government says West African peace keepers 
repelled rebel attacks, but the Catholic News Agency Mizna says reports 
from the area support rebel claims they have regained control of the 
city.
