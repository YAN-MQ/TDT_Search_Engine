Kenya's national cricket team has turned professional five months 
ahead of the Cricket World Cup after Kenya Breweries Ltd. announced 
an annual sponsorship package Monday of 8 million shillings (dlrs 
130,000). ``We shall expect them to play without problems as we start 
our World Cup built-up,'' said Jimmy Rayani, chairman of the Kenya 
Cricket Association. Cricket officials said some of the money will 
meet the salaries of the 21 players and the technical bench, including 
the coach. The sponsorship deal under Tusker brand beer will last 
for five years and will be subject to renegotiation annually. KCA 
said it will start its World Cup buildup between March 19-27 with 
a team from Bangladesh, the current International Cricket Committee 
trophy holder. In last the World Cup, Kenya upset West Indies by 73 
runs. The East African nation also beat India by 69 runs during the 
Coca Cola tournament in India which featured the hosts and Bangladesh. 
Kenya Breweries, which has reverted to its former name, East African 
Breweries, is fighting to stave off competition from South Africa 
Breweries, who entered the Kenyan market this year. The Kenyan brewers 
have invested about dlrs 2.5 million in soccer and cricket.
