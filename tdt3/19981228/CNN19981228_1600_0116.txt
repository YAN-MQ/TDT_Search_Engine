If you're on social security and are concerned about how the infamous 
Y2K bug might affect your payments, your worries could be over. The 
social security administration says it's finally ready for the new 
millennium. Ginger Blackstone reports. The social security administration 
says it has good news for the millions of Americans who rely on benefit 
checks every month. The social security system is now 100% compliant 
with our standards and safeguards for the year 2000. To make absolutely 
certain, the system has been tested and validated by a Panel of independent 
experts. The system works. It is secure. The threat of the Y2K bug 
began decades ago, when programmers of early computers used only the 
last two digits of the year, mostly to save money. But that means, 
when 2000 hits, older systems will think the year is 1900. There's 
concern computers with the older technology will crash on midnight 
of the new millennium. To make sure the federal government stays in 
business, the Clinton administration set a goal of correcting all 
critical computer systems by march 31st, 1999. The social security 
administration says tackling the bug in its department was no easy 
task. It took 2,800 systems employees, including 700 programmers. 
We have to keep track of annual earnings for more than 145 million 
workers. We take 6 million applications for benefits each year, and 
we make those monthly benefit payments to 48 million Americans. We 
depend almost totally on modern information technology to get our 
job done. Millions of Americans rely on these payments, as Ken apfel 
said, to meet basic living expenses. Thus, it is absolutely critical 
the systems that make these payments be Y2K compliant, so the citizens 
who depend on these checks can be sure that their payments will not 
be disrupted by Y2K problems. So even if other Y2K problems arise, 
the federal government says social security recipients can be assured 
-- the check's in the mail. Ginger Blackstone, "Headline News."
