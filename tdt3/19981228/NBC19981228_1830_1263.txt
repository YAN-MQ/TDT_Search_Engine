The people who race yachts all around the world are known for their 
wealth, and their daring. But no amount of money or bravery could 
conquer what's been going on off the coast of Australia for the past 
several days during a prestigious race between Sydney and hobart, 
the capital of tasmania. They call it the "hell on high water" race, 
and with good reason. Here's NBC's Jim Maceda. a dramatic rescue on 
the high seas as one of the world's most prestigious yacht races turns 
tragic. They're away. Saturday, 1:00 P.M. Australia time. 115 yachts 
start what is always a daunting race. It's called "hell on high water" 
and begins with trouble. In a collision at the start. Already, gale-force 
winds tear at the sails. Within minutes, the American entry, "sayonara," 
is hurting. They've blown out the corner of their spinnaker! But the 
ship recovers and, despite risky 40-mile-per-hour winds, the race 
pushes on. But bad weather turns unpredictably even worse gusts of 
80-mile-per-hour winds. A storm can come up, and if you are in the 
wrong place at the wrong time, it could have grave consequences. Sunday, 
3:00 P.M., the Australian maritime authority tracks the first distress 
beacons. Mayday, mayday. Hurricane winds whip up 40-foot waves. By 
Sunday night, 58 yachts have turned back or capsized. Within hours, 
a massive air and sea rescue operation plucks yachtsmen from choppy 
waters. These British crewmen lose their skipper, an Olympic sailor, 
when their yacht is broadsided by waves the size of four-story buildings, 
flipping the boat repeatedly. We got another 360 rollover without 
the mast, and that put a lot of water in the boat. I'm just glad to 
be alive I tell you! So is American yachtsman, John Campbell. This 
afternoon on the last leg, his ship, the "kingurra," rolls over. He 
spends 40 minutes treading water near death. I really did not feel 
that I was going to be found at one point. I kept up hope, but it 
looked pretty grim. In another tragic incident today, two Australian 
crewmen drowned when this ship capsized. In all, two confirmed dead, 
14 still missing. The search continues even as the winner, the American 
yacht "sayonara" crosses the finish line. Winning this race is an 
act of survival. Jim Maceda, NBC news.
