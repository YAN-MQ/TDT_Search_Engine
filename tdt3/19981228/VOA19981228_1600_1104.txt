Connecticut and Duke have held on to the top two spots on the Associated 
Press College Basketball poll for the third week in a row. The Undefeated 
UCON Huskies beat Fairfield by 35 points in their only game last week 
to receive 63 of 70 first place votes from a panel of national media. 
Duke beat Kentucky 71-60 to claim six number one votes and second 
place. Cincinnati moved up one spot to number three after wins over 
Houston and Dayton. That's the highest ranking for the Bearcats since 
they were number one early in the 1996, 97 season. Maryland and Stanford 
each moved up one place to fourth and fifth, while Arizona moved up 
two spots to number six. Kentucky dropped four places to number seven 
after losing two games in a row for the first time since 1994. Indiana, 
North Carolina, and UCLA fill out the Top Ten.
