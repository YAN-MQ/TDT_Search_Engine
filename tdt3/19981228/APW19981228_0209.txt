JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Floods caused by heavy rain washed away 
100 homes on Indonesia's main island of Java, forcing many residents 
to flee their villages, a newspaper reported Monday. A total of 18 
villages were swamped Sunday after torrential rain swelled the Kelawing 
river in West Java province. A dam also overflowed, the daily Kompas 
newspaper said. Some 2,440 houses also were flooded and hundreds of 
acres (hectares) of rice and other crops were damaged. Roads linking 
major towns in the province were inundated with water levels of 0.5 
meter (1.5 feet). Electricity was cut in some areas. There were no 
reports of casualties.
