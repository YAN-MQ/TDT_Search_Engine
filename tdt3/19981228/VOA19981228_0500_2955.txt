Turning to financial news this hour, European stock markets are higher 
today. The market is up in Frankfort, and in Zurich, and in Paris. 
However the London Footsie 100 is down about 40 points this Monday. 
Earlier, in Asia, stocks were mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 Index lost 
89 points. The Hong Kong Hang Sen Index fell 122. Singapore stocks 
fell nearly a percent, but South Korean shares rose for a third day,
