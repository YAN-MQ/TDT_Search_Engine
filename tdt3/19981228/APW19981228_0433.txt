Pope John Paul II has thanked Cuban leader Fidel Castro for allowing 
Christmas to be celebrated on the Communist-run island as an official 
holiday, the Vatican said Monday. ``I want to express to you my deep 
appreciation for the decision to give back to Christmas its holiday 
character for all Cubans, conforming to tradition,'' the pope said 
in a telegram to Castro, whom he wished a happy holiday. The telegram 
was sent Dec. 23 but disclosed only on Monday. In November, the Cuban 
government declared Christmas an official holiday, and this year allowed 
the local Roman Catholic Church the rare privilege of broadcasting 
a national greeting on state radio. In the telegram, the pope said 
he was praying so that ``with the collaboration of all the citizens, 
this noble country, always present in my heart, can consolidate its 
way toward a more prosperous, just and fraternal society.'' John Paul 
met with Castro when he visited the island in January. During that 
pilgrimage, the pontiff called for an end to the U.S. economic embargo 
on Cuba. The Christmas message by Cuba's top Catholic leader, Cardinal 
Jaime Ortega, further testified to warmer relations between Havana 
and the church. Although the government declared itself atheist in 
1962, Christmas remained an official holiday until 1969.
