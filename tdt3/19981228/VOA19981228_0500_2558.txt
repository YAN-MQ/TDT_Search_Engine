Australia's annual marathon, Sidney to Hobart Yacht Race has been 
marred by the death of two yachtsman. As the American yacht Maxi Sayonara 
heads for victory, gale force winds and three-story high waves have 
transformed the race into an excuse and exercise in survival. Ron 
Mankuran reports from Sidney. Race veterans say conditions are the 
worst they've seen in the race's 54 year history. Late Sunday, vessels 
began hitting 70 knot winds and 30 meter high seas off the southern 
Australian coast, and in Bass Strait which separates Tasmania from 
the mainland. The 12 meter Australian yacht Business Post Maid rolled 
in 10 meter seas washing over two sailors, interim skipper Bruce Guy 
and crewmember Phil Skeggs, both of Tasmania. Mr. Guy is believed 
to have suffered a heart attack, and Mr. Skeggs drowned, unable to 
detach himself from his safety harness. Prominent British yachtsman 
Brynn Charles is missing after being swept off the capsizing Sword 
of Orion. Air and sea search crews using naval craft and night vision 
goggles have been unable to locate him. More than 50 sales have been 
pulled from the sea by rescue helicopters. The crew from the 15 meter 
yacht Winston Churchill, which was missing since they sent a May Day 
call to officials, has been rescued after 36 hours at sea. In spite 
of the severe conditions, some yachts continue to forge ahead. The 
US Maxi Sayonara, which got through the treacherous waters before 
conditions turned fierce has taken a lead over rival Sydney Yacht 
Brenda Della. Ron Mankuran for VOA News, Sidney.
