Well, while 12 national football league teams are preparing for the 
playoffs, the end of the regular season has left five coaches looking 
for new jobs. After his third straight losing season and tenth consecutive 
loss to the Green Bay Packers, the National Football League Chicago 
Bears have fired coach Dave Wanstadt. The Carolina Panthers will have 
a new coach next season, after firing Dom Capers, the only head coach 
in the franchise's history. Capers says he just did not win enough 
games to keep his job. I understood at the time I took the job that 
our responsibility was to win football games. And this year we did 
not win enough football games, and that's life in the NFL. So, I'm 
sorry to say that that's the reason the Carolina Panthers will have 
a new head football coach next year. Ray Rhodes also felt the sting 
of losing, but says he understands why the Philadelphia Eagles let 
him go. This is a business about production, and I'm very well aware 
of that. When you don't win, you know changes have to be made. And 
this is part of the business, this is a tough part of the business, 
but this is part of the business. Other NFL coaches fired on Monday 
included Ted Marchabroda of the Baltimore Ravens and Dennis Erickson 
of the Seattle Seahawks.
