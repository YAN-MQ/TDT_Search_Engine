In Nashville, Tennessee, authorities have captured two more escaped 
prison inmates. A state corrections official says the two were found 
this morning in an industrial area about three miles from riverbend 
maximum security institution. One of those caught today is serving 
a 65-year sentence for second-degree murder. The other is serving 
seven years for burglary and a previous escape. In all, six inmates 
escaped from the prison early yesterday during the preparation of 
a Ramadan meal for Muslim inmates. One inmate is still at large.
