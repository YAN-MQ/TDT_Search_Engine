Some 250 more Namibians from a troubled strip of land have crossed 
the border into Botswana, bringing the total since October to 1,763, 
authorities here said Monday. The latest arrivals from the Caprivi 
strip came within the past 10 days, said government spokesman Andrew 
Sesinyi. The Namibians are seeking refugee status, saying they are 
fleeing persecution by the Namibian government. Authorities in Namibia 
accuse them of supporting secession of the Caprivi area, South African 
Press Association reported. The strip runs along Botswana's northern 
border, dividing Botswana from Angola and Zambia to the north. It 
touches Zimbabwe on the east. The influx of Namibians has contributed 
to tensions between Botswana and Namibia, two fairly stable countries 
in southern Africa. Botswana has declined to send them back, instead 
urging them to return voluntarily. ``We hope the threat of persecution 
is over, and that these latest arrivals are people rejoining their 
families and not activists,'' Sesinyi said. ``We know the Caprivi 
movement split many families.''
