In Tennessee tonight, a manhunt for six inmates has ended. The men 
escaped from a maximum security prison over the weekend, have been 
captured. ABC's Erin Hayes reports from Nashville. This afternoon, 
two more of the inmates were found. Ne of those caught had made it 
more than a couple of miles from the prison, found wet, cold and clearly 
spent, they gave up pretty easily. The last inmate to be taken, Aaron 
Tyrone James in prison for killing a 65-year-old woman. Prison officials 
say the six overpowered guards with a homemade knife, locked them 
up and ran for the fence. We assumed they grabbed a mattress from 
the bed. And they put it over the razor wire. But guards on the outside 
didn't immediately realize there had been an escape. Investigators 
are now trying to figure out why. Prison officials are thankful tonight 
they had two things on their side. Tennessee's wintery weather and 
the fact that the inmates escaped wearing only light clothes. In the 
end, the weather proved to be a bit too much for them. Erin Hayes, 
ABC News, Nashville.
