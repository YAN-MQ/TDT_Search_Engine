The government said it paid no ransom for the release of a Lithuanian 
businessman who was kidnapped in Chechnya more than 18 months ago, 
and finally brought home Monday. Viktoras Grodis, 35, was immediately 
hospitalized. His health was described as poor. ``We really did not 
pay for releasing the businessman,'' Rimantas Sidlauskas of the Foreign 
Ministry said. Grodis' captors had demanded 100,000 dollars ransom, 
or more than the average Lithuanian earns in 36 years. They threatened 
to cut off his head and send it to his wife. Prime Minister Gediminas 
Vagnorius personally appealed to Chechen leaders for Grodis' release, 
but refused to use public funds for that.
