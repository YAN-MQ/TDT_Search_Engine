Grain and soybean futures prices fell in quiet trading Monday on the 
Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean futures prices fell as the market 
reacted to the U.S. Agriculture Department's weekly export report 
which showed little export business and dismal prospects in the future. 
There also was concern about favorable growing conditions in South 
America. Corn futures prices also were affected by growing conditions 
in South America and the possibility of future competition from Argentina 
for export business. The market also was nervous about the liquidation 
getting underway in the hog industry and the likelihood of decreased 
demand for feed grain. There was little news in the wheat market, 
which was slightly lower at the close of trading. Losses were limited 
by the expectation the federal government will begin making wheat 
purchases as part of the U.S. commitment to provide food assistance 
to several countries. Wheat futures for March delivery settled a 1-4 
cent lower at dlrs 2.82 1-2 a bushel; March corn was 1 1-2 cents lower 
at dlrs 2.19 1-4 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at dlrs 1.08 
a bushel; January soybeans were 4 3-4 cents lower at dlrs 5.43 1-4 
a bushel.
