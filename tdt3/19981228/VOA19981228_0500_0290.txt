Palestine leader Yasir Arafat has accused Israel of calling new elections 
in order to avoid implementation of the Wye River Peace Accord. The 
Palestinian leader was reacting to the Israeli government's decision 
to halt implementation of the Wye River Accord until after new elections 
scheduled in April. He said the call for elections has frozen the 
peace process. On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
insisted it is the Palestinians who have frozen the peace process 
by failing to do their part, such as collecting illegal weapons held 
by Palestinian police and civilians.
