In the pacific northwest, postholiday travelers have met with every 
kind of bad winter weather you can name. A low pressure system has 
brought rain, snow, fog, ice, high winds and all the travel disasters. 
That means closed-down roads and airports. We get our late report 
tonight from NBC's Mike Boettcher. East of Seattle, heavy snow forces 
the closure of two major mountain passes blocking interstate 90 for 
24 hours. If it doesn't open soon, I will go home. Thousands of holiday 
motorists who thought they were going home went nowhere, sleeping 
in their cars until this afternoon when the roads were finally reopened. 
Hotel rooms were at a premium. People said they'd give me $30 if they 
could sleep in the lobby. Along the Washington coastline, strong winds 
knocked out power to 25,000 and heavy rain triggers mudslides. One 
sends a house sliding into puget sound. When we started hearing the 
noise, we grabbed the kids and N out towards the deck and on the beach. 
Rivers across western Washington are rising. Many are expected to 
flood in the next two days. Thousands have been told to prepare to 
evacuate. If we come to that, we will be evacuating up the street 
to the church. The situation is expected to get worse. More heavy 
rain is predicted for tonight and tomorrow, extending from washington 
into Oregon. I'm sorry. The highway is closed. Flooding has closed 
several roads in Oregon and mudslides have added to the chaos. What 
can you do about it? It just happens. Flying presented problems, too. 
All major airports in the San Francisco bay area closed because of 
fog. One united flight to San Francisco ended up in Denver. They came 
on the loud speaker and said sorry, we have bad news. Your flight 
to San Francisco is canceled. With a series of storms poised off the 
pacific northwest coast tonight, more rain will bring only more bad 
news. Mike Boettcher, NBC news, Seattle.
