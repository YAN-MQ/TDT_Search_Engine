When we come back, the routine dig and the amazing find. Gosh, you 
know, I just went to use the phone. And you say once you got back 
your wife was gone? Yes, sir. Hello! What? Have you checked the hot 
enchilada? oh, no! Millicent gets terrible heartburn. Not this time. 
What's that? Looks like the remains of an individually wrapped pepcid 
ac chewable. Introducing pepcid ac chewables. The first chewable to 
stop heartburn before it starts. Millicent, is that you? Start living 
heartburn free with new pepcid ac chewables.
