The associated press news editors polled the top stories of the year 
is also out tonight. To no one's surprise the Clinton-Lewinsky mess 
is number one on their list. Again these are news managers who picked 
the stories, not the readers or viewers. For the record, numbers two 
through 10 are the McGwire-Sosa home run race, the world economic 
turmoil this year, hurricanes georges and Mitch, the showdown in Iraq, 
the big G.O.P. losses at the at election time, the bombings at embassies, 
school shootings, Glenn's return to space and the tobacco settlement.
