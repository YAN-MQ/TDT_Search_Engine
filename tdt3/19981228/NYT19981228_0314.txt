The cartoon colors that Japanese tourists seem to favor in ski suits 
_ orange, pink and shiny silver _ may not be missed on Canadian ski 
slopes this winter, but the extravagant spending habits that Japanese 
tourists used to bring with them certainly will be. Since the spread 
of Asian economic flu through Japan and other Pacific countries over 
the past year, Canadian tourism has been hit hard. By October the 
number of Asian tourists had dropped by 19.7 percent across Canada. 
And except for unusual attractions like the aurora borealis and the 
house on Prince Edward Island that was the inspiration for ``Anne 
of Green Gables,'' Canadian tourism destinations have lost some of 
their biggest spenders. ``They have traditionally been very generous 
visitors,'' Rod Harris, the president of Tourism British Columbia, 
said of Japanese tourists. ``It's a source of great concern.'' British 
Columbia has done slightly better than the rest of Canada in luring 
Asian tourists despite the economic slowdown that has crippled the 
economies of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. So far this year, Asian 
visits to British Columbia are down 17 percent. Asian tourists often 
stop in Vancouver or Victoria, two major West Coast cities with large 
Asian populations. Harris said that while fewer Asian visitors are 
taking extravagant cross-country tours, many continue to make the 
trip to the nearest destination in Canada, which is British Columbia. 
Since Asian visitors make up 33 percent of overseas visitors to Canada 
who stay for at least a night, the decline represents a loss of about 
$78 million in the first six months of this year alone, according 
to the Canadian Tourism Commission. The sharpest drops are in the 
number of visitors from South Korea, down almost 60 percent, and mainland 
China, off almost 25 percent. The decline in Japanese tourists is 
less steep, 16 percent, but it hurts more because Japanese are the 
largest single group of Asian visitors to Canada and the ones who 
spend the most money. ``It's definitely having an impact,'' said John 
Olsthoorn, a spokesman for the Canadian Tourism Commission. ``Fortunately, 
the increase in American tourists has helped buffer the drop.'' A 
significant weakening of the Canadian dollar this year has made traveling 
north a bargain for Americans, who can expect an exchange rate of 
from $1.45 to $1.50 Canadian for every American dollar. American overnight 
visits to Canada in the first 10 months of 1998 totaled 13.3 million, 
a 10.6 percent increase over the same period in 1997. ``That has more 
than compensated for the erosion in visitors from the Asia-Pacific 
region,'' said Harris. He said that Americans from border states who 
hop in their cars and drive to Vancouver or the ski slopes at Whistler, 
British Columbia, do not spend as much as the rich Japanese tourists, 
but there are many more of them. ``The absolute size of the U.S. market 
is far larger than any other of our other international markets,'' 
he said, ``so when the number of U.S. tourists grows, even though 
some of it is short-haul visits, the overall effect is very positive.'' 
Asian visitors to some specialized Canadian sights are driven by dreams 
and will come despite economic conditions. Kathie Adam, general manager 
of the Northern Frontier Visitors' Association, a government tourism 
office in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, said she hasn't 
noticed any decline in the number of Asian tourists planning to come 
to see the aurora borealis. Perhaps the most specialized Canadian 
destination for Asian tourists is Prince Edward Island, the home of 
Lucy Maud Montgomery, author of ``Anne of Green Gables.'' For more 
than a decade, Japanese girls have been fascinated by the freckle-faced 
Anne, and a visit to the house in Cavendish that inspired the book 
has become a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage. ``What we have here is 
a niche market for people who really have an interest in Anne,'' said 
Bob Brammer, owner of Prince Edward Tours, an agency that specializes 
in Japanese tourists. Brammer said his agency has handled about 5,000 
tourists in the last 12 months, a decline of only 3 to 5 percent, 
despite current economic conditions. ``I had one lady who said she 
had been saving for close to 10 years,'' he said. ``For many, it's 
a lifelong dream.'' Brammer said Japanese tourists used to want to 
see all of Canada, starting with British Columbia and working east 
to Banff National Park, Toronto, Niagara Falls and the city of Quebec 
before arriving at Prince Edward Island. ``Now they land in Atlantic 
Canada or the United States before heading here,'' he said. ``It's 
cheaper.''
