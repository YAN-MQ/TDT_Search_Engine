Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliate are about to take a 
two minute break. This is VOA News Now. Here's a bit of history for 
you. On December 28, 1832 John C. Calhoun became the first Vice President 
of the United States to resign. Mr. Calhoun quit after a dispute with 
President Andrew Jackson over the Doctrine of Nullification. Mr. Calhoun 
of South Carolina was the leading advocate of Nullification, a political 
philosophy asserting that when the legislature of a state believes 
that a federal law or regulation violated the Constitution, it could 
vote to ignore it. The law in question, in 1932, was a federal tariff 
on cotton. South Carolina and the South's main agricultural export. 
Vice President Calhoun helped to engineer a compromise between the 
issue here and the President and prevented violence. Well, we're coming
