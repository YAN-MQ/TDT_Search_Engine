Foreign ministers from five West African countries meet in Ivory Coast 
to discuss the growing crisis in Sierra Leone. The Abidjan meeting 
follows heavy fighting over the weekend around McKenny, a key city 
in Northern Sierra Leone. The United Nations Sunday condemned efforts 
by the rebels to oust an elected president. They called on them to 
lay down their arms and enter the peace process unconditionally.
