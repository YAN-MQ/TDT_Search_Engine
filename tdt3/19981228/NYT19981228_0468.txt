There was a time in America when New Year's Eve belonged to one man, 
Guy Lombardo, who generously shared it with the rest of us. From the 
Roosevelt Hotel, on radio, and the Waldorf-Astoria, on television, 
he and his sweet saxophones turned the passing of one year and the 
birth of the next into the biggest thing since the adoption of the 
calendar. But Lombardo died in 1977, a month before his 48th New Year's 
Eve in New York, and the band, under the direction of a nephew, veered 
dangerously off the musical path that had made the Royal Canadians 
the longest running dance band ever. At midnight that year, as usual, 
the band played the Lombardo theme song, ``Auld Lang Syne,'' but in 
a jarring disco arrangement. After that, things were never quite the 
same. For the next decade, the Royal Canadians struggled to find their 
way back. Lebert Lombardo, Guy's only surviving brother, who had been 
the lead trumpeter since the 1920s, ``wasn't cut out to do this all 
by himself,'' said his daughter Gina Cudahy, who with a brother and 
sister own the rights to the band and its music library. So Lebert 
Lombardo, who died in 1993, licensed the band to others. Five leaders 
came and went. One died in midseason. Eventually, agents for the Lombardos 
heard a joyful noise in the Midwest, went to Cleveland and met Albert 
Theodore Pizzamiglio, who, for the sake of a theater marquee long 
ago, had become Al Pierson. ``I had my own successful band,'' Pierson 
said, referring to Big Band U.S.A., which toured the world, performing 
in the tradition of Glenn Miller, the Dorsey brothers and others. 
``But here was a chance to take on a band I had always admired, a 
band I grew up with.'' And imitated. Pierson, 66, said he became a 
Lombardo fan as a boy in suburban Chicago, where he and his younger 
brother, Robert, and his parents, Italian immigrants, lived over the 
family grocery store. On weekends and evenings, his father, Anible, 
played saxophone for his own group, Nebe's Midwest Dance Band. Blessed 
with an impartial embouchure _ lips that could play a variety of horns 
and reeds _ Pierson could also transcribe by ear. So the father placed 
the son by the radio to snatch Lombardo arrangements. In high school 
and at Illinois State University, where he studied music and later 
taught, Pierson almost always had a band ready to go. By 1974, the 
road called full time, and Big Band U.S.A. took off. Home base now 
is Aubrey, Tex., near Dallas, where he and his third wife, Nancy, 
raise Lipizzaner horses on a 50-acre ranch. They have five grown children 
between them. In early 1989, Pierson was performing in Cleveland when 
the Lombardos' business agents tracked him down, liked what they saw, 
and made a deal: exclusive licensee of the Lombardo band. It's a ghost 
band, but Pierson says it presents no identity crisis. Lombardo, a 
famously dapper man man who liked to race speedboats, was barely 5 
feet 4 inches tall. He rarely spoke from the bandstand, and used the 
baton mostly as a prop, preferring to chat amiably with dancing couples. 
Pierson, at 6 feet 3 inches, is a bear of a man with a bushy mustache 
and the genial goodwill of a staunch Rotarian. On a break recently 
between a riverboat cruise on the Mississippi and an engagement in 
Phoenix, he flew into New York wearing a misshapen old sport coat 
and slacks and an Atlanta Braves hat that covered more scalp than 
hair. ``I don't think of myself as being Guy Lombardo,'' Pierson said. 
``I'm in the spirit of Guy Lombardo, the spirit of his music, but 
with my own personality. I'm friendly, I talk to everybody.'' Pierson, 
who sings and plays the piano, is gregarious in front of an audience, 
cracking jokes with local flavor. Before the usual second number, 
a tune that was a hit for the band in 1937, Pierson might say: ``We 
dedicate this to the Atlanta Braves fans out there. The name of the 
song is `Boo Hoo.''' Since Feb. 12, 1989, when Pierson picked up the 
Lombardo baton, he says he has tried not only to secure the Lombardo 
heritage, but also to expand it. ``Guy only played in the U.S. and 
Canada,'' he said. ``The farthest the band ever went was Hawaii.'' 
No more. Now the Royal Canadians go on cruises, they have flown to 
32 countries and they play in nearly every corner of the United States 
_ up to 300 engagements a year. This is good news, because the millennium 
approaches, and Pierson is determined to ring it in. Last year on 
New Year's Eve, the band was in Wabash, Ind. This Thursday, it's booked 
at the State Theater in New Brunswick, N.J. Next year it will be at 
a big Las Vegas hotel, and probably on television. Although the band's 
popularity still confounds some critics _ they call Lombardo the ``Prince 
of Wails'' and poke fun at the signature saxophone vibratos and clippety-clip 
rhythms _ it remains user-friendly to any couple who want to dance 
cheek to cheek. At Washington and Lee University in Virginia not long 
ago, the band was playing in one gym and a rock group was booked for 
another. ``There were 4,200 kids,'' Pierson said. ``By the end of 
the evening they were all in our gym dancing, and the rock band had 
shut down.'' How come? ``The kids said they liked hearing the words 
to all those pretty songs,'' he said.
