The rebel group UNITA said Monday it had no information about a U.N.-chartered 
cargo plane that crashed in an area where rebels and the army are 
engaged in fierce fighting. The C-130 aircraft carrying 14 people 
crashed Saturday at Vila Nova near the city of Huambo, about 500 kilometers 
(310 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda, according to the United 
Nations. ``We don't know anything about it,'' UNITA Secretary-general 
Paulo Lukamba Gato said by satellite telephone. ``There's heavy fighting 
in all that area.'' The government says the plane crashed in a UNITA-controlled 
area, and the United Nations has appealed to both the rebels and the 
government to guarantee safe passage for a search and rescue team. 
Gato said he had not received the United Nation's request for safe 
passage, and that he could not comment on the request until it was 
presented directly to the UNITA leadership. Gato denied the government's 
accusation that rebel forces advancing on Huambo shot down the plane 
about 10 minutes after it took off from the city. The plane, owned 
by TransAfric, was painted with the U.N. colors, and both sides were 
informed of the flight's schedule before takeoff, the United Nations 
said. The 10 passengers on board included three Angolans, two Russians, 
an Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian and a Namibian. 
The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a Bolivian and 
a Filipino. Eight of the passengers were members of the U.N. Observer 
Mission in Angola, and two were employed by a private communications 
company, Dinacom, which works with the United Nations, Hamadoun Toure, 
a U.N. official in Luanda, said Sunday. The observer mission, which 
is monitoring a 1994 peace accord that halted a two-decade civil war 
between the rebels and the government, has been unable to stop the 
renewed fighting. ``The government broke off dialogue with us, so 
now we're talking with weapons,'' Gato said. He added that he had 
no information on the number of casualties from the fighting, which 
erupted Dec. 4. The main battles have focused on the central highland 
cities of Huambo and Kuito, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east, 
which provide a traditional powerbase for UNITA, a Portuguese acronym 
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. The Roman 
Catholic Bishop in Kuito said the government-held city had been relatively 
calm since heavy shelling by UNITA last week that reportedly killed 
some 200 people. ``We are only hearing sporadic fire in the distance,'' 
Bishop Jose Nambi said by phone. The government said Monday its forces 
had knocked out UNITA's forward artillery position in Ceilunga, a 
village 15 kilometers (10 miles) north of Kuito, over the weekend 
and killed 34 UNITA troops. There was no information on government 
casualties. The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay at Angola's 
apparent slide back to civil war. The country has been ravaged by 
conflict since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975.
