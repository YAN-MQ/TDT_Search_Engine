Congo Kinshasa peace talks have ended in Tripoli apparently with no 
direct talks between President Kabila and the rebels. The Associated 
Press quotes rebel leader Ernest Wamba Diawamba as saying Sunday in 
Kigali, he and President Kabila had no contact while the two men were 
in Tripoli over the weekend. Rebel ally Yawrie Musabetie of Uganda 
joined Mr. Kabila and Mr. Wamba Diawamba in Tripoli for the discussions 
with Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi.
