The National Football League Playoffs have been finalized after action 
in the final regular season gains on Sunday. In the National Football 
Conference, the Arizona Cardinals reached the playoffs for the first 
time since 1982, with a dramatic 16-13 victory over the San Diego 
Chargers. Chris Jackie booted a 52 yard field goal with three seconds 
remaining, to put Arizona in a wildcard game next Saturday against 
the division rival Cowboys in Dallas. The San Francisco Forty-niners 
defeated the St. Louis Rams 38-19 to secure the right to host the 
Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The Minnesota Vikings and the Atlanta 
Falcons earned a BI from the first round with the best NFC records 
this season.
