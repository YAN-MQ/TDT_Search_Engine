Meanwhile, the global economy has turned downward and Japan has been 
both victim and scapegoat. Asia correspondent Matt Frye expects Japan's 
problems to continue for two reasons. The Japanese are the fastest 
aging population in the world and they are very worried about their 
pensions. Therefore, people are saving more money, as opposed to less 
and that means that consumer spending in Japan will continue to go 
down and that, effectively, will cripple the world's second richest 
economy. The other reason is, of course, is that Japan is the world's 
largest creditor, is really the kind of key to the financial bloodstream 
of the globe. And if the Japanese banks started -- calling in their 
debts or if Japan stops being the creditor it has been so far, I think 
you can see that effect ripple around the world very fast.
