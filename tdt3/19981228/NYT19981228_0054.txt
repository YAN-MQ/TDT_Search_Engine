High-school teachers are abuzz with reports that Latin, long given 
up for dead, is actually showing a pulse. But the more remarkable 
news in language circles may really be that millions of American teen-agers 
continue to study French, despite _ and let's be gentle about this 
_ the fading significance of France and the French language. Consider 
that according to the most recent surveys, nearly 1 out of every 4 
American students who learn a foreign language in middle school and 
high school still chooses French, a language spoken fluently by only 
about 1 out of every 50 people on the planet. By contrast, 1 percent 
of American teen-agers study Chinese or Japanese, which combined are 
spoken by 20 percent of the world's people. This comes as French has 
effectively ceded to English its longtime standing as the first language 
of diplomacy, among other crowns. So is French being taught out of 
proportion to its role in the family of nations and the global economy? 
Richard Brecht thinks so. He is the director of a group called the 
National Council of Organizations of Less Commonly Taught Languages, 
which represents anyone teaching languages other than English, French, 
Spanish and German. He comes down particularly hard on French (studied 
by 22 percent of teen-agers) and German (6 percent), saying he can 
think of no good reason to push them on so many American students 
at the expense of Russian or Japanese. ``The only answer that makes 
sense, besides the fact that those are the languages available, is 
that they are just so deeply embedded in our cultural traditions,'' 
said Brecht. ``It becomes a cultural argument, not a logical argument, 
and that's not an argument.'' Brecht, a professor of Russian at the 
University of Maryland, said it makes sense for Americans to know 
Spanish, which is ``our second language'' and which two out of three 
teen-agers learn. So too the languages of Asia and Russia because 
their actions have social and economic consequences for the United 
States. Yet only 0.3 percent study Russian, 0.17 percent take Cantonese 
and Mandarin and 0.77 percent Japanese, according to the American 
Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. For the nation's middle 
and high schools, the reasons for offering French are often quite 
basic. One is tradition: America's love affair with French can be 
traced to 18th-century Southern colonists, whose classical education 
included the language. Though the world may have changed since then, 
a school's attempt to broaden its language palette can be difficult, 
with the teachers and time needed to offer Russian or Chinese or Arabic 
_ harder and longer to master than French or Spanish _ in short supply. 
For the second year, Lake Forest High School in Felton, Del., a small 
town near Dover, is offering Japanese to 10 students. But to squeeze 
it into the curriculum _ to meet their language requirement, roughly 
half the students take Spanish, the other half French _ the class 
is given after school, via satellite from the University of Georgia. 
The program costs $5,000, and the principal, Michael Carr, said that 
the district could not have afforded it without a federal grant. There 
are, of course, more than a few Francophiles who are appalled at any 
suggestion that the importance of French is declining. After all, 
French is necessary for translating the later works of Voltaire, or 
even the earlier works of Celine Dion, a French Canadian. And how 
would one know the difference between coq au vin (chicken in wine 
sauce) and un joli coco (a stinker)? Defenders of French can be found 
even in traditionally unfriendly places. A British official at the 
United Nations, who insisted on anonymity so he would not be seen 
as a defender of the French, said that French can occasionally be 
useful. ``If you want to impress your girlfriend,'' he said, ``have 
a bit of French pillow talk.'' Holding out another olive branch, he 
added, ``I don't think you should necessarily be hard nosed, saying 
you should only learn a language that is going to further your business 
interests. People need an education to be enlightened, and French 
is part of that.'' But French has limited practicality, he conceded. 
``I have enough trouble in a cab in New York,'' he said. ``There, 
Urdu might be helpful.'' Not so for those traveling to Quebec, where 
French is a necessity and the use of English is restricted on signs, 
or for those interested in the arts. Morgan Arenson, a ninth grader 
at the Fieldston School in the Bronx, is in her third year of French, 
which she believes will help her in becoming a ballerina. ``The steps 
that are done, they were named in France, because that is sort of 
where ballet took hold,'' said Morgan, 14. ``We do little stories 
in French class. Someone was throwing something and the book used 
the word jeter. I thought, `Oh, I know what that is.''' Amanda Wilder, 
an 11th grader at the Kent School in Litchfield County, Conn., could 
have chosen German, Spanish, Japanese or Latin. While most of her 
classmates selected Spanish, she picked French. ``I had been told 
that French was the language of the diplomats,'' she said, ``and that 
all high-powered people, such as Madeleine Albright, spoke it.'' Yet 
it is in the area of diplomacy that French has suffered some of its 
bitterest losses. While some in France continue to swat away Americanized 
phrases like le stress and disque-jockey that have slipped through 
their borders, delegates of former French colonies from Africa and 
Southeast Asia are increasingly choosing to communicate in English 
rather than French at official conclaves. And at the United Nations 
in 1996 the French lost a very public battle to keep Kofi Annan of 
Ghana from succeeding Boutros Boutros-Ghali as secretary-general. 
The French had objected because Annan speaks French with an English 
accent. It is perhaps telling that Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian who 
speaks excellent French, is now secretary-general of La Francophonie 
in Paris, which, he says, is seeking to ``promote solidarity'' among 
52 nations that share French as a first, second or, in the case of 
Egypt, third language. ``My mother tongue is Arabic,'' Boutros-Ghali 
said, ``I write in Arabic, dream in Arabic and have disputes with 
my wife in Arabic.'' ``But among the different languages,'' he added, 
``I believe French has a certain weight.''
