the messy weather that ruined holiday travel plans over the weekend 
isn't much better tonight. chuck roberts looks at the current conditions 
on both sides of the country. the sound of melting ice -- not exactly 
music to ears of people in virginia. first, it's a "pop," then it's 
a "bam," almost like a war zone. branches are shifting as they lose 
their ice coating, bringing down more power lines and causing more 
damage. people without power have been flocking to motels en masse. 
came here last night. decided we wanted some heat. utility crews in 
alabama, tennessee and mississippi are working double-time to undo 
the damage caused by falling trees. tens of thousands of people are 
without power. utility companies in alabama say some customers won't 
get their electricity back until wednesday. on the west coast, a nasty 
snowstorm is causing trouble for motorists in washington state. the 
risk of avalanches forced authorities to close two key passes through 
the cascade mountains because of the risk of avalanches. heavy rains 
and melting snow triggered mudslides in oregon. mud up to 20 feet 
deep blocked highway 101 south of tillamook. and some places along 
the highway are under nine feet of water. and in northern california, 
a thick blanket of fog grounded dozens of flights at san francisco 
and san jose airports. while some travelers took the opportunity to 
catch up on sleep, others were left floating in a sea of frustration.
