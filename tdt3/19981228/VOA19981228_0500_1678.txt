You know our story from Jill Hoyt reminds us that there are many legends 
and notions of the American West that influence us today. Of course 
we all have so many visions in our minds about cowboy movies and all 
of those types of things. And one of them is, "Draw your gun there, 
partner." Well there's a story that comes out of Durham North Carolina, 
that is a completely different take on Drawing your gun. Of course 
that phrase usually means that a person has withdrawn a gun from a 
holster, aimed it, and is ready to fire. But the way it came out in 
Durham, North Carolina, the police have encountered a bank robber 
who actually drew a gun. Police have been looking for a man who made 
a drawing of a small hand gun on a note he gave to a bank teller. 
The man reportedly had spent several minutes at the bank tellers check 
writing counter, and then when no one was around he finally approached 
the teller. He handed her this illustrated note which included the 
words, "this is a robbery". Now the teller didn't see a real gun. 
She saw just this drawing, but she decided that was enough. She wasn't 
going to take any chances. She gave the man the money. He grabbed 
a handful, ran out of the bank. And the police detective approached 
the teller as saying the drawing of the gun was a darn good drawing 
too, very detailed and very artistic. So that's a new take on an old 
phrase about "Draw your gun, partner."
