Prime Minister Hun Sen defied growing pressure Monday to bring two 
Khmer Rouge leaders to trial for genocide and said they would face 
neither an international tribunal nor a Cambodian court. ``If we bring 
them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it will only mean a 
return to civil war,'' Hun Sen said before a Cabinet meeting. ``We 
should dig a hole and bury the past and look toward the future.'' 
The Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, remained holed 
up in the ex-rebel stronghold of Pailin in the northwest, where they 
were staying in guest houses under the protection of old comrades 
who defected to the government two years ago. They agreed to defect 
_ in effect, surrender _ in a phone call with Hun Sen on Christmas, 
20 years to the day after Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia to topple 
the bloodstained Khmer Rouge regime. The government Monday rejected 
intense international demands that Khieu Samphan, the official leader 
though others held real power, and political chief Nuon Chea stand 
trial. Over the past two years, the government broke the back of the 
Khmer Rouge by offering amnesty to leaders in exchange for ending 
civil war, bringing peace to large areas of Cambodia for the first 
time in a generation. With the movement now all but extinct _ only 
one leader, the one-legged general, Ta Mok, and perhaps 100 followers 
are still at large _ demands are growing for someone to be held accountable 
for the reign of terror that left as many as 2 million people dead. 
But Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge official who fled bloody purges 
in 1978, said peace was more important than prison. ``This is a pure 
Cambodian solution,'' Hun Sen said. ``We know the right medicine to 
use to cure this problem. If any foreigners try to add something, 
it will never go away.'' Hun Sen said he had the support of King Norodom 
Sihanouk. In Washington, the U.S. State Department noted Sunday that 
the Cambodian government has repeatedly asked for _ and received _ 
help aimed at bringing top Khmer Rouge leaders to justice. ``We trust 
that no actions will be taken by any party that could preclude achieving 
this goal,'' spokesman Lee McClenny said. ``Justice in Cambodia has 
been long delayed, but must not now be denied.'' United Nations legal 
experts recently visited to assess the possibility of creating an 
international tribunal to try Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against 
humanity. Though many Cambodians rate peace as more important that 
bringing the killers who once ruled them to trial, the recent U.N. 
visit raised hopes of finding justice away from the always volatile 
politics of Phnom Penh. Hun Sen said there was little point: ``If 
the wound no longer hurts, we shouldn't poke a stick in it and make 
it bleed. ``Should we kill Khieu Samphan or welcome him for national 
reconciliation?'' Hun Sen asked. ``This deal is a bouquet of flowers 
for this pair, not a bullet or a pair of handcuffs.'' Earlier, government 
spokesman Khieu Kanharith had said that speculation about a trial 
was raising fears among the defectors that they would be arrested. 
Hun Sen's assurances should make it easier for them to keep a scheduled 
meeting with him in the capital Tuesday. Gen. Meas Sophea, deputy 
army chief of staff, had said the trip was still on schedule and the 
rebels would receive tight security. In Pailin, they are relatively 
safe. Though nominally under government control, the area is run by 
a pardoned former Khmer Rouge chieftain, Ieng Sary, their old comrade. 
The last time Khieu Samphan visited Phnom Penh in 1991, shortly after 
a landmark peace treaty was signed, he was hurt in a mob attack orchestrated 
by the government. The Khmer Rouge eventually turned their backs on 
the treaty. As many as 2 million Cambodians perished of disease, overwork, 
starvation and executions after the Maoist revolutionaries won a civil 
war in 1975 and forced the population into labor camps. The opposition 
Sam Rainsy Party said that the victims have waited too long for justice. 
``We believe that the evidence is sufficient to hold them in custody, 
according to national and international law, pending a trial for crimes 
against humanity,'' the party said.
