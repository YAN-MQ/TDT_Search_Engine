The chairman of the International Soccer Federation, Joseph Blatter 
said in a year-end magazine article that said he's concerned about 
soccer being flooded with too much money, watering down its real value 
as a people's sport. In the article that appears in Monday's editions 
of Germany's sports weekly Kicker, and titled ``My Warning to Soccer,'' 
Blatter also says he is also concerned by the influence of business 
and television on soccer. ``Even when I am fully aware of the rules 
of supply and demand in the market, we must still ask ourselves whether 
too much money comes into play, whether the players have lost their 
moderation and become too egoistic and influential?'' ``Is not the 
influence of industry, television, yes even politics meanwhile too 
great?'' Blatter writes. He also questions whether soccer, because 
of its popularity, has not become a tool of the powerful and strong. 
While his thoughts won't be gladly received by sponsors and big companies 
who are planning to take over major soccer clubs, such as BSkyB's 
proposed big to take over Manchester United, Blatter said they have 
to be faced. ``We have to ask ourselves what we can do about it? Who's 
behind it? What recourse do we have?'' Blatter said. ``One thing is 
very clear: if top soccer continues its current path, then it is not 
a good thing.'' He said soccer must get back to the joint interests 
of all ``and that means the game itself,'' which he added is what 
really binds overall interests. Soccer has only become so big and 
meaningful ``because it is universal, in that it had place for the 
great and small, the powerful and the weak. '' If that principle of 
solidarity falls, then soccer's future looks bleak, Blatter said. 
``In the end the fan decides. If he no longer goes to the stadium, 
or doesn't watch it on television, then there is no longer a viewers 
rating, and also no more television money,'' Blatter said. ``Then 
the interest is gone, and children move away from soccer,'' the FIFA 
chief said. ``Believe me, I will do everything in my function as FIFA 
chairman to keep for soccer its essential basic worths.''
