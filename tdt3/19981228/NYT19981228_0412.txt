The Baltimore Orioles began last season with a major league record 
payroll that was a shade under $70 million and ended it with a payroll 
of $72 million. Six teams are expected to open the 1999 season with 
payrolls that eclipse those totals. The Orioles, Yankees, Atlanta 
Braves, Cleveland Indians, Los Angeles Dodgers and Texas Rangers have 
already surpassed $60 million and are on their way to payrolls starting 
at close to $75 million and ranging close to the mid-$80 millions. 
The Dodgers and the Yankees, who were second to the Orioles this year 
with season-ending $65.8 million payrolls, are expected to be 1-2 
in the season-opening salary standings. Of the six teams beyond $60 
million, they face the toughest hit in salary arbitration, a procedure 
that will be played out over the next month. ``We're looking at a 
payroll of about $82 million,'' Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general 
manager, said by telephone from Los Angeles Monday. He said the Fox 
ownership had not placed a ceiling on his payroll, but he added, ``I'm 
trying to be as cost efficient as I can.'' George Steinbrenner does 
not place artificial limits on his player budget either, though he 
seems to be more cost-conscious than in his earlier years as the Yankees' 
principal owner. The Yankees should wind up with a payroll of about 
$81 million. Based on incomplete returns _ payrolls are incomplete 
because not all players have signed for 1999 _ the Orioles are at 
$78 million for 21 players, the Braves $71 million for 20, the Indians 
$69.6 million for 20, the Dodgers $67 million for 18, the Yankees 
$66 million for 17 and the Rangers $61.5 million for 14. The Dodgers' 
payroll was ballooned by their signing of Kevin Brown to a seven-year, 
$105 million contract. Brown has a $10 million salary next year and 
also receives a $5 million signing bonus up front. In determining 
payrolls, both the clubs' labor-relations office and the Players Association 
prorate signing bonuses over the life of the contract. ``We've kept 
the payroll flat since I got here,'' said Malone, who became general 
manager late in the season. ``When I came in, I was looking at a payroll 
of 72-73. It went up with the Kevin Brown signing, of course.'' Besides 
signing Brown, Malone has made some major trades, dealing Bobby Bonilla 
and Charles Johnson and adding Todd Hundley and Mel Rojas. He is not 
finished trading because he wants to shed some salary. ``I've got 
to move about $5 million,'' he said. ``I don't have to, but I believe 
I'm going to move some money. I have six starting pitchers and two 
starting shortstops. I've got surplus. If I move one of each, I'm 
talking about $5 million coming off.'' The Dodgers have five players 
eligible for salary arbitration, including three of those starting 
pitchers and one of the shortstops. The pitchers are Ismael Valdes, 
Carlos Perez and Darren Dreifort. The shortstop is Mark Grudzielanek. 
The fifth player is outfielder Todd Hollandsworth. The Yankees, who 
uncharacteristically have signed no other team's free agents this 
off-season, face salary arbitration for the first time with Derek 
Jeter and Mariano Rivera and for the second time with Andy Pettitte. 
In his first year of eligibility last year, Pettitte went from a $700,000 
salary to a negotiated $3.75 million salary and earned a $50,000 bonus. 
Jeter and Rivera had their contracts renewed last year at $750,000 
each and very likely will seek salaries close to $4 million. Pettitte 
could try for something close to $6 million. If the three players 
wind up gaining a collective total of $13 million, that would put 
the Yankees at $79 million. Another $2 million or so for Jorge Posada, 
Ramiro Mendoza, Ricky Ledee and Shane Spencer would take the payroll 
to $81 million. The Mets will not be one of the teams that surpasses 
the Orioles' record. They have 14 players signed for a total of $50 
million and expect to be somewhere in the $60 millions. They face 
salary arbitration with Edgardo Alfonzo, Hideo Nomo, Rey Ordonez, 
Turk Wendell and two newcomers, Armando Benitez and Roger Cedeno. 
With the upsurge in payrolls at the upper end, the disparity with 
payrolls at the lower end will grow next season. But the Montreal 
Expos, whose $8.3 million payroll was the lowest for the 1998 season, 
figure to start next season with a higher payroll, though by how much 
remains to be seen. The Expos have five players signed for a total 
of $7 million. Of course, they could trade Rondell White and instantly 
lop off his $3 million salary. The Pittsburgh Pirates had the second-lowest 
payroll last season at $13.7 million, but they have dabbled in the 
free-agent market this off-season and have 14 players signed for a 
total of $16 million.
