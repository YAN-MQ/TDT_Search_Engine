Two months after the National Basketball Association's lockout came 
and his paycheck went, Kenny Anderson began contemplating the unthinkable. 
It had nothing to do with asking his mother in Queens for his old 
room back or taking a part-time security job; He figured there are 
only so many indignities young millionaires should have to face. But 
with his penchant for buying what he wanted and his accountant having 
to borrow against his stocks to keep investing, Anderson realized 
it may be time to do without. Sort of. ``I was thinking about selling 
one of my cars,'' he said recently, laughing. ``I don't need all of 
them. You know, just get rid of the Mercedes.'' After all, he can 
always fall back on the Carrera Porsche, the customized Range Rover 
or the Lexus sedan. When you have eight vehicles registered in your 
name or your wife's, there are choices. Insurance alone on the cars 
and sport utility vehicles has been costing Anderson about $75,000 
a year. Throw in a mortgage in New York, rent in Los Angeles, four 
daughters, one marketing company, an agent's cut and endless legal 
fees, and a rough portfolio of the veteran NBA player begins to emerge. 
He is often fabulously wealthy, but sometimes the opulent lifestyle 
collides with a monstrous tax bracket. Tremendous financial obligations 
mount quickly, which can sometimes lead to economic insecurity for 
even some of the game's highest-paid players. ``A lot of people can't 
understand why the owners and players are fighting over money and 
how it might hurt the season,'' said Anderson, referring to the league's 
growing labor chasm. ``I'd be upset too if I was a fan, paying our 
salaries. But it's like they say: The more you make, the more you 
spend. And right now, without my check, I have to start getting tight.'' 
Anderson, the 28-year-old point guard of the Boston Celtics, was due 
his entire $5.8 million salary for the 1998-99 season on July 1 _ 
the day NBA owners declared a lockout after the collective bargaining 
agreement expired. He is one of more than 20 players who were supposed 
to get paid during the summer but did not, and one of 226 players 
with guaranteed contracts who will not be paid for the first two weeks 
of the season, which were canceled on Oct. 13. More cancellations 
may follow, and if more than 30 games are cut from the 82-game schedule, 
the league will strongly consider not playing the season. The NBA 
hopes that the financial pressure this will place on the players will 
eventually divide them and prompt the union to sign an agreement that 
slows the growth of salaries and puts a ceiling on how much one player 
can earn. As a measure of how severely the players' resolve will be 
tested, Anderson is losing $76,000 a game. ``I wouldn't want to miss 
the season, not just for financial reasons but losing a year of my 
playing career,'' said Anderson, a seven-year veteran. ``But if I 
had to, I can. I've been without before. ``The guy I feel bad for 
is the one with the two- or three-year deal and now their contract 
is up. In that case, I think people will have their own agendas. It's 
going to be sticky. There might be some guys branching off, saying, 
`I can't do this.' Not being in their situation, I can't blame them. 
When that happens, everyone will go, `Oh, he's selling out.' But, 
hey, you got to live.'' Scott Bercu, Anderson's Manhattan-based accountant, 
said, ``These guys have got to concede for a very simple reason: They're 
losing money every time they don't play a game.'' In addition to players 
like Anderson who at least are under contract even if they are not 
being paid, there are nearly 200 registered free agents who have some 
of the same bills that Anderson has. Having signed a seven-year deal 
worth $49 million with the Portland Trail Blazers two years ago, Anderson 
is in a much better position than many of his peers. His contract 
average of $7 million a year does not compare with Michael Jordan's 
$33 million deal, but his annual income dwarfs the league's average 
salary of $2.6 million. But for now, the cash-flow problem is the 
same. ``I've had to sell some mutual funds and borrow against stocks 
to keep investing,'' Anderson said. ``I've got enough to hold me over. 
And I definitely don't want anyone feeling sorry for me. I mean, when 
you make money like we do, it's pretty hard to get public sympathy. 
But it's all relative to your lifestyle and obligations.'' In his 
midtown Manhattan office, Bercu punches up Anderson's finances on 
a computer screen. In a blink, you learn that playing basketball for 
a living does not only guarantee you celebrity and wealth; there are 
mounds of checks to sign, too. Anderson, his wife, Tami Akbar, and 
their two daughters, Lyric, 4, and Kenni, 2, live in a five-bedroom 
home in Beverly Hills, not far from Shaquille O'Neal's mansion. The 
peach pastel house has large pillars, a four-car garage and a gazebo 
in the backyard. Two stories below are a pool and tennis and basketball 
courts. The monthly rent is $12,500. Anderson pays $7,200 in monthly 
child support for Danielle, 8, and Kristinise, 5, who were born to 
different women. He has been involved in each child's life as much 
as he can be during the season. ``They can burn a hole in your pocket 
real quick,'' he said. ``I'm not saying it in a funny way, but you've 
got your schooling, day care, nanny. It just goes on and on.'' Anderson 
also pays $3,000 a month on mortgage, property taxes and maintenance 
for his mother's home on Long Island. Of the $5.8 million he is supposed 
to receive this year, the agent David Falk, who negotiated the contract, 
is entitled to 4 percent _ $232,000. Bercu said Anderson's legal and 
accounting fees run about $175,000 annually. And then there is Kenny 
the Kid Enterprises, Anderson's fledgling marketing company based 
in Century City, Calif., which at this point does not bring in as 
much money as it shells out. Run by his longtime friend Rodney Henry, 
the company exists essentially to handle all of Anderson's day-to-day 
operations and appearances. A clothing line is in its infant stages. 
The company also books musical talent for outlets such as BET (Black 
Entertainment Television) and helps further the acting career of Anderson's 
wife, who has done commercials and was once a regular on MTV's ``Real 
World.'' With teams unable to provide daily public-relations assistance 
to every player, and with agents like Falk too burdened with other 
prominent clients to concentrate on promotion, many players are hiring 
or developing their own marketing firms. The cost for five employees, 
office space, supplies and telephone for Kenny the Kid runs $250,000 
per year. ``Kenny doesn't live a life of Riley; he doesn't have unlimited 
money,'' Bercu said. ``Without many shelters and at such a high tax 
rate, he's literally a partner with the government. Of the $5.8 million, 
I'd say he probably sees about $3 million of that money.'' Anderson 
said he used to give family members and friends loans of $3,000 to 
$5,000, but he has stopped doing that since the lockout began. ``I've 
got to get tight,'' he said. ``I've cut back on certain things I usually 
do. You got to watch your money when it comes to family. I have to 
say no now even though I don't want to say no.'' Bercu said: ``He 
calls them loans, but I call them gifts. He's too generous and sweet 
sometimes for his own good. Especially when it's family. But then, 
when you come from where he came from ...'' A New York schoolboy legend 
at Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens, Anderson has played for 
four teams the last three seasons. Once regarded as an heir apparent 
to the NBA career assist leader John Stockton, Anderson has weathered 
injury and expectation while settling into a role of a solid playmaker 
the last several seasons. If his career lasts more than 10 years, 
he will be among the league's fortunate players. ``His life is really 
a short-lived life from a financial point of view,'' Bercu said. ``One 
of the things I do for Kenny is invest for him, so I rely on money 
coming in to set aside long-term savings. Before the lockout began, 
we started borrowing against his stocks. We're talking a substantial 
loan. And then with the losses in the market. You know they're going 
to rebound. Still, for a lot of these guys without their salary checks, 
it's a bit of a nightmare situation. If he doesn't get paid soon ...'' 
Anderson is not clipping coupons yet. A rough estimate of his total 
financial obligations, not including personal expenses, runs about 
$1 million annually, leaving him with $2 million in reserve. Anderson 
is allotted $10,000 a month by Bercu, ``hanging-out money,'' as he 
likes to call it. Tami gets $3,500 from a special household account. 
His favorite car is his 1995 Mercedes SL 500 metallic red sedan _ 
one of eight vehicles in a price range between $50,000 and $120,000. 
``Those cars are extremely hard to insure,'' Bercu said. ``Because 
of a couple of speeding tickets, we've had lots of difficulties. But 
what can you do? Ballplayers are into cars and jewelry. It's what 
they like. You can't help it.'' Extravagant and expensive tastes have 
been a hallmark of young millionaire athletes. But without games and 
paychecks, NBA players are about to learn the frugal side of living 
large. How long many of them can cope without a biweekly salary may 
mean the difference in their economic game of chicken with the owners. 
``I just look at it as when this thing finally gets done, I get my 
money,'' Anderson said.
