A delegation of right-wing Chilean senators arrived Sunday to warn 
that the arrest of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet could 
destroy democracy in Chile and ``seriously imperil'' relations with 
Britain. Outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet is under police 
guard, scuffles broke out when a visitor, reportedly Chilean Sen. 
Ignacio Perez Walker, left after seeing Pinochet and made taunting 
gestures toward the protesters yelling for a trial. Several demonstrators 
climbed over barriers but were blocked by police. Others were held 
back by their fellow protesters. Police reported no arrests. ``We 
have come to represent to the British authorities that as long as 
they keep their hands in Chilean affairs, they are seriously damaging 
the process of transition in Chile,'' said Carlos Bombal, a right-wing 
senator, who arrived with six other senators seeking Pinochet's release. 
Pinochet, 82, was arrested Oct. 16 on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate 
seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture 
during his 17-year rule. The Chilean government has urged Britain 
to release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a 
senator, he is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Britain says he does 
not have immunity and the government cannot intervene. ``Once you 
start to say to the Metropolitan Police as politicians: `Look, we 
don't want you to carry out that warrant for arrest that has been 
given by the magistrates,' you are only one step away from politicians 
telling the police who you do want to have arrested,'' Foreign Secretary 
Robin Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview on Sunday. 
Pinochet's lawyers go to High Court on Monday to try to get the arrest 
ruled invalid. London's Observer newspaper reported Sunday that Pincohet's 
aides planned to ``spirit him secretly'' back to Chile Oct. 17. But 
a Pinochet ally, Miguel Schweitzer, a former ambassador to Britain, 
said the Foreign Office had been told he planned to leave Oct. 20. 
He underwent spinal surgery Oct. 9. The Foreign Office acknowledged 
it allowed Pinochet to use a VIP suite a London's Heathrow airport 
when he arrived last month. In the Chilean capital, Santiago, some 
5,000 anti-Pinochet demonstrators gathered peacefully in a park. On 
Saturday, a rally by more than 20,000 Pinochet supporters ended in 
scattered clashes with police. In Stockholm, a group of Chilean immigrants 
to Sweden filed at a police station three complaints of murder and 
kidnapping of relatives during Pincohet's rule. Pinochet ruled from 
1973 until 1990 and remained army commander until last March as part 
of a compromise in Chile's transition to democracy.
