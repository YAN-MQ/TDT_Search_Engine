The fall elections are just nine days away. Tonight, we're going to 
take a look at some of the more interesting races. In California, 
senator Barbara boxer is in a tight re-election contest. President 
Clinton has been there all weekend, hosting fund-raisers. But as this 
race shows, where the president is involved, money isn't everything. 
Here's ABC's Mike Von Fremd. With the president campaigning in California 
this weekend, barbara boxer's campaign hopes to raise $1 million more 
today. But her close relationship with the president has complicated 
her re-election campaign. Yes, our president is paying a terrible 
price for his mistakes, and yes, we're dealing with it. But boxer 
was a defender of the president during the first seven months of the 
Lewinsky controversy. The problem for boxer is that all of this has 
an uncomfortably familiar ring. She was in the spotlight, criticizing 
justice Clarence Thomas in 1991 after allegations ofexual harassment 
by Anita hill. And again in 1995, she went after senator Bob Packwood 
after he was accused of sexual harassment. Why is it when an issue 
comes before the Congress that involves sexual misconduct it is treated 
differently than any other case? All of this has given republican 
challenger Matt fong political ammunition. She has one standard for 
her friends and another standard for her opponents. Republican heavy 
hitters have been joining fong, sensing boxer is vulnerable. Matt 
fong is the alternative to a very polarizing politician. But campaign 
records revealed in today's "San Francisco examiner" may polarize 
fong's campaign. He donated $50,000 to a lobbying group that is against 
gay rights, a group that once advocated quarantining people with AIDS. 
Even before today's news, the most recent polls showed boxer taking 
a Slight lead. Hang in there. You'll make it. Whether she makes it 
or not will depend, of course, on voter turnout. Six years ago, boxer's 
supporters were energized over her role in the Anita hill controversy. 
They may be less enthusiastic this time around. Mike Von Fremd, ABC 
News, San Francisco. In that Senate race, the state's largest newspaper, 
"the Los Angeles times," endorsed Matt fong today.
