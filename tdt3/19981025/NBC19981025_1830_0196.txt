The model for an enduring mideast peace was the camp David accords. 
Today the architect of that deal marked a milestone. NBC's Joe Johns 
reports. The camp David accords in 1978 were different from acurrent 
agreement the frame work that led to a peace treaty. After decades 
of strife, Egypt promised no more war. It is a great moment in the 
history of foundations and in mankind. The players, an Egyptian president 
who were awarded the nobel peace prize. And Jimmy Carter. Today, Carter 
marked the anniversary with of the award with a speech. At a single 
word of that treaty has been violated. It's been a testament that 
it's possible for Arabs and Israelis who have been at war with each 
other, can find peace. So that it is permanently beneficial to both 
sides. His speech was part of a lecture series, the widow of the egyptian 
leader. It took a lot of courage, which I admire for prime minister 
Netanyahu to make the concessions that he has made. Carter said Yasser 
Arafat does not have the power to make unilateral decisions because 
of the coalitions he has to hold together. But anyone working with 
the Middle East must be optimistic that the process can move forward. 
Joe Johns, Washington.
