The jets resembling New York's finest. I'm Anthony Keith James, and 
this is "Headline Sports." To week eight of the NFL. The falcons and 
jets -- the jets win. Henderson with a fumble return for the score. 
Checking out the rest of week eight, the Packers putting away the 
Ravens. The Vikings too much for the lions. The 49ers stomping the 
Rams. Sqlerry rise with a pass reception setting a record for receptions 
in 184 straight games. The bucks falling. Coming up tonight, the bills 
and Doug Flutie go for the win. By me playing right now and winning 
some games, it may help Rob Johnson be the Super Bowl MVP, you know? 
We could put ourselfs in a position to get back in the race and Rob 
comes back and wins six in a row and go into the playoffs with a bye 
week. So you never know how things are going to work out. We are trying 
to win football games whether me, Rob or alex. Alex has to be ready. 
I could sprin an ankle on the first play of the game.
