Tamil rebels have released three civilian crewmen and six soldiers 
taken captive during the past four years to the International Red 
Cross, military and aid agency officials said Sunday. The rebels on 
Saturday released the Sri Lankan captain and a crew member of the 
``Iris Moana,'' a ferry which they hijacked in 1995 while it was transporting 
Tamil civilians in northern Sri Lanka, said the officials who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. The two were among five crewmen captured 
by the rebels when they seized the ferry, and took 135 Tamil passengers 
aboard hostage. The other three crewmen are still kept hostage. The 
Tamil civilians were released soon after the hijacking. Twenty one 
naval sailors were killed when they tried to rescue the passengers 
on board the seized ferry. The rebels also released a crew member 
of the ``Missen,'' a ferry they set ablaze while it anchored in the 
sea off Sri Lanka's northwestern coast last year, said the officials. 
Two Indonesian crewmen aboard the ship were released earlier, but 
some Sri Lankan crewmen were held captive. Six soldiers captured by 
the rebels in various confrontations in northern Sri Lanka were also 
released Saturday, said the officials. It was not immediately known 
how many more civilian crewmen were being held by the rebels who are 
fighting for a separate homeland in the nation's north and east for 
minority Tamils, claiming that they are discriminated by the majority 
Sinhalese who control the government and the military. More than 54,000 
people have been killed in the civil war since 1983.
