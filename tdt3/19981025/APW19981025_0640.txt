The headlines heaped praise on Liverpool striker Michael Owen Sunday 
for returning with a four-goal performance against Nottingham Forest 
while team co-manager Roy Evans defended his decision to drop the 
18-year-old striker against Valencia in the UEFA Cup. Owen's non-appearance 
on the Liverpool starting lineup against the Spaniards Tuesday prompted 
speculation that English soccer's brightest young star for decades 
might be burning out. He netted four times on his return in a 5-1 
thrashing of Forest Saturday and said he wanted to play every game 
he could. ``I don't have to prove anything to anybody,'' he said. 
``A few weeks ago people were comparing me to the best player on the 
planet and stupid things like that. ``Now I'm being told I should 
be in the side, it's a crazy world that we live in, I think. ``Whether 
it was right to leave me out is debatable,'' Owen said. ``A lot of 
people have said what they think about it, and the managers decided 
to give me a rest. ``On this evidence it looks as if it has paid off. 
But I'm young and I want to play in every match, the managers know 
that. ``If it was felt that I was tired, fair enough. But I feel fine 
in myself and I want to play,'' Owen said. ``I was told it was in 
my best interests, if that is what the managers think, then that is 
the decision.'' Evans explained that he and co-manager Gerard Houllier 
decided to rest the young player against Valencia because they knew 
that England coach Glenn Hoddle would almost certainly field Owen 
at every possible opportunity. ``England won't rest him, they won't 
do it,'' Evans said. ``So someone has to look at the situation and 
we have been given that task. It's not nice sometimes because you 
may suffer with a result. ``Obviously (Owen) doesn't just have the 
burden of Liverpool on his shoulders, but England too. There has been 
a lot of stuff heaped on Michael's shoulders that I don't think should 
be.'' Evans saluted Owen's performance against Forest but stressed 
it was the result of a team effort. ``Michael certainly enjoyed himself, 
ably assisted by the team,'' he said. ``The quickness of our play 
and the sharpness of the passing got him into scoring positions and 
he capitalised on it. ``But without the rest of the team he is not 
going to be able to do it. He'll get the limelight, but from our point 
of view after a spell when we haven't looked the part, we got ourselves 
back on song. ``At 18 he has to get better,'' Evans said. ``He has 
things to learn and he wants to learn, which is the main thing. He's 
capable of scoring from all positions, and that can only improve with 
age.'' Evans said Owen had no problems with being left off the team 
against Valencia. ``He took it the right way. Michael never doesn't 
want to play, like any kid,'' the Liverpool manager said. ``It's a 
game of football and if we said to him play every day, play twice 
a day, he'd do it. ``But we are custodians of his talent. During the 
week he had looked really tired, so we took him out of one game. We 
may have paid the penalty because we didn't get a great result against 
Valencia, but it's not about one week it's about 10 to 12 years.''
