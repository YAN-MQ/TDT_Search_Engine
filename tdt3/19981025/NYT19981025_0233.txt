Nowadays, the eyewear of choice among really cool people onstage is 
that favored not by European movie stars but by accountants. The glasses 
made famous by the likes of Clark Kent and Woody Allen are popping 
up regularly at New York's more outre theatrical addresses. There 
they are, perched on the nose of David Latham, the shorter of the 
duo of hipster comics known as Premium Bob, in the team's new show, 
``Dobie McDobie,'' at the Flea Theater in SoHo. Erin Quinn Purcell, 
playing a lovelorn bombshell, dons the fashionably unfashionable frames 
in ``Duet! A Romantic Fable,'' a sendup of American courtship at the 
Actors' Playhouse in the West Village. And isn't that a pair on one 
of those pointedly distracted guys in ``Total Fictional Lie,'' the 
unslick performance piece at Performance Space 122 in the East Village, 
by the slacker troupe Elevator Repair Service? The eyewear of the 
brainy, the weakling, the social misfit represents a kind of visual 
shorthand: It proclaims the wearer's outsider status. Still, appearances 
can be deceiving. Mild-mannered Clark actually has superpowers; the 
neurotic Woody of the movies is, of all things, a romantic leading 
man. Similarly, the owlish players in the aforementioned downtown 
shows are anything but squares. Sporting the dorky spectacles are 
self-assured young entertainers who only look like lifetime members 
of the National Honor Society. Who they aspire to be, in fact, are 
hip exemplars of an emerging sensibility in performance art and comedy 
that anoints the outcast, that celebrates the nerd. To be nerdy these 
days, it seems, is to be cutting-edge. From Andy Dick, the irrepressibly 
geeky gofer on the sitcom ``News Radio'' to the performers on cable 
comedy shows like ``Viva Variety'' and `` Show,'' to almost any character 
Jim Carrey elects to play, nerdiness is a true comic virtue, a sure 
sign of in-the-know sophistication. These clownish goof-offs are such 
self-conscious put-ons, so redolent of show-biz savvy, that the audience 
is always aware that the actor is ``on'' and not really playing a 
character. Their performances, cynicism posing as innocence, are emblematic 
of a seen-it-all, media-saturated age, a period in which nothing seems 
spontaneous and everything in politics and culture is suspected of 
being rigged, a time when the greatest humiliation of all is not to 
be in on the joke. A spate of new stage shows, occupying some of the 
smarter downtown precincts, are the newest outlets of what might be 
called nerd culture. Taking cues from such varied sources as Richard 
Foreman, Andy Warhol and Andy Kaufman, these quirky productions poke 
fun at the diversions of the egghead set. ``Total Fictional Lie,'' 
for instance, is a deadpan lampoon of the washed-out middle American 
characters who fascinate documentary filmmakers. ``Dobie McDobie'' 
takes on, among other things, the inflated myth-making properties 
of television news. And in ``Madame Fury,'' at the Here Theater in 
SoHo, the comic actor Blair Fell and his company, Aunt Bea's Dilemma, 
make an all-out assault on that outpost of high culture, ballet. All 
three have some wildly amusing moments; in ``Madame Fury,'' Fell provides 
some choice lines to a tyrannical, weight-obsessed ballet master based 
on George Balanchine, given to declarations like ``What is a heart 
but an extra 5 pounds you should diet away?'' But at other times the 
cleverness of these productions seems a bit twee, and even mechanical. 
The difficulty with this world-weary brand of humor is similar to 
the problem encountered in standing at a mirror and practicing a wink: 
The harder you work to induce the reflex, the less successful it can 
become. It's revealing that some of the best jokes are manifestations 
of old-fashioned physical comedy, as when Latham's Premium Bob partner, 
Paul Boocock, turns to the audience and flashes a charlatan's million-dollar 
smile, or when the ballerinas of the rival companies in ``Madame Fury'' 
do battle like tutu-clad ninjas, arabesquing to the death. Yet there 
is more than enough imagination and comic energy exhibited in each 
of these shows to anticipate, and desire, even bigger things from 
these companies. Elevator Repair Service provides the weirdest immersion 
in nerd culture: ``Total Fictional Lie'' is a kind of live-action 
version of the ``Real Audio'' cartoon segments created by Robert Smigel 
on ``Saturday Night Live,'' interspersed with the company's jerky 
(and mesmerizing) dance sequences, choreographed by Katherine Profeta. 
In the hourlong show, performed on P.S. 122's bare stage, random scenes 
from actual documentaries _ including films about Paul Anka, the serial 
killer Aileen Wuornos, and a door-to-door Bible salesman _ are re-enacted 
by the seven-member cast. The funniest features Robert Cucuzza as 
the Bible hawker, trying to close a deal with a nearly catatonic homemaker 
played by Leslie Buxbaum; the banal scene repeats twice, with the 
actors delivering hilarious approximations of the film subjects' accents. 
``We take oddahs,'' Cucuzza says again and again, and it's only after 
the eighth or ninth repetition that his meaning (orders) becomes clear, 
at least to us; Ms. Buxbaum remains blissfully oblivious. The gags 
here are a rarefied sort; they have to do with how at odds the language 
and movement of the theater are with everyday conversation and behavior. 
Under the direction of John Collins and Steve Bodow, ``Total Fictional 
Lie'' affords a fresh and surprising, if more than a little oblique, 
perspective. It's a perspective shared by ``Dobie McDobie,'' with 
its cross-cutting style and pop-culture references dished out to the 
audience at hyper-speed, and by ``Madame Fury,'' which expects audiences 
to be on their toe shoes, too. These shows are, in their way, advanced 
exams as much they are entertainments, which only makes sense, since 
eggheads tend to do well on their SATs.
