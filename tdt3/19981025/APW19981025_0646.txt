Alex Corretja staged a fine comeback to win his first indoor championship 
Sunday, saving a match point before beating Tommy Haas 2-6, 7-6 (8-6), 
6-1 at the dlrs 750,000 Lyon Grand Prix. After easily grabbing the 
first set, unseeded Haas was 6-5 ahead in the second set tiebreak 
against Spain's Corretja, the No. 4 seed here and world number seven. 
But Corretja blasted a backhand past Haas, who was at the net, to 
save the match, before winning the tiebreak 8-6. Earlier in the second 
set, Corretja saved four break points at 0-2. ``Coming back from 0-2 
and 0-40 down after losing the first set was incredible. At that stage 
it looked like it would be a very quick final,'' Corretja told reporters 
after the match. ``On match point, he came to the net to put pressure 
on me,'' Corretja said. ``But I made a good shot and after that I 
think his confidence went a little bit.'' The match turned in the 
Spaniard's favor in the first game of the final set, when he got a 
lucky deflection off the net to break service. Corretja is the first 
Spaniard to win an indoor championship since Manuel Orantes' victory 
at the Houston Masters back in 1976. But the victory looked unlikely 
earlier in the match. In the first meeting between the two players, 
the Roland Garros finalist fired three aces in the first game but 
Haas still took the game to take an early lead. Haas, 20, showed no 
sign of nerves in what was only the second final of his career. He 
continued to look comfortable on the Spaniard's service, and broke 
again to race into a 4-1 lead, easily taking the first set in just 
29 minutes. Corretja, 24, has now won eight titles, including four 
this year, but before the Lyon event he had only ever won one match 
indoors, against Tim Henman at the Paris Open last year. ``I hope 
this win will be the start of better form indoors. A lot of it has 
to do with mentality. I have worked hard to improve my indoor game 
and I am glad it is paying off,'' he said. The Barcelona-born player 
collects dlrs 101,500, and 200 ATP points, for winning the trophy. 
By winning here, he also qualifies for the ATP world championship 
in Hannover. Haas came into the Lyon tournament ranked 53 in the world. 
After a quarterfinal victory against France's Fabrice Santoro - the 
player who beat him in last year's Lyon Grand Prix final - Haas profited 
from walkovers against No. 1 seed Pete Sampras and No. 3 seed Marcelo 
Rios to reach the final.
