France's defense minister said Sunday that ballistic missiles developed 
by Iran upset the Mideast balance of power and questioned whether 
a U.S anti-missile system offered to the Gulf would provide the best 
protection. Alain Richard made the comments to reporters in this oil-rich 
Gulf state and on a visit earlier in the day to nearby Qatar. Speaking 
in the Qatari capital Doha, he discussed Iran's the Shahab-3 missile 
which, with a range of 1,300-kilometers (800 miles), is capable of 
striking Israel or U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. ``These missiles threaten 
the strategic balance of power in the Gulf and the Middle East,'' 
Richard said. When asked about the proposed U.S. anti-missile system, 
he said: ``We believe every country has the right to protect itself 
against missiles, but anti-missile technology does not take care of 
all threats.'' Later, in Kuwait, Richard said France does not ``believe 
that heavy and expensive anti-missile systems could a factor in maintaining 
security in the long term.'' Instead, it would bring ``further escalation.'' 
Asked about alternatives, Richard said ``agreements on limitation 
of the use of weapons'' are a good solution. ``That is very simple, 
it is not too expensive and in some regions it is working.'' Richard 
met with Kuwait's defense minister, Sheik Salem al-Sabah, and was 
scheduled to leave late Sunday. Kuwait signed a 10-year defense agreement 
with France after the 1991 Gulf War that liberated the Gulf state 
from a seven-month Iraqi occupation. Similar pacts were signed with 
the United States and Britain. France, Britain and the United States 
vie for influence in the Gulf, where they have sold billions of dollars 
in arms. U.S. defense secretary William Cohen made a six-nation Gulf 
tour earlier this month aimed at trying to convince allies to finance 
a regional missile defense system. The United States has said long-range 
missiles from both Iran and Iraq could be a danger to the region. 
Iraq denies it has long-range missiles in violation of U.N. resolutions, 
and Iraq says its missiles are defensive. Richard signed an expanded 
defense pact with Qatar in Doha on Saturday shortly after he arrived. 
Details of the agreement, which enlarged a 1994 pact, were not available. 
French officials earlier suggested it would include forming a joint 
military committee and upgrading technical cooperation. France maintains 
close relations with Qatar, a tiny nation sitting on the world's third-largest 
reserves of natural gas. Qatar buys more than 70 percent of its weapons 
from France, and Qatari military personnel routinely train in France. 
Richard also presented the Qatari army with a gift of 10 Leclerc battle 
tanks on Sunday.
