Traffic in central Madrid came to halt Sunday as some 2,000 sheep 
were herded throught the city as part of an annual procession to highlight 
the need to protect Spain's ancient transhumance routes. With bleating 
interspersed with the tinkling of bells making a welcome substitute 
from the customary car horns of this busy city, dozens of people lined 
the sidewalks as the merinos trotted through Alcala street, the central 
Puerta del Sol square and out to the Casa de Campo parkland on the 
city's southwestern outskirts. The herding, staged each October for 
the past five years, is to highlight the need for national and local 
authorities to protect Spain's 125,000 kilometers (78,000 miles) of 
transhumance paths _ some dating back 800 years _ which are used for 
the seasonal movement of livestock from different grazing grounds 
around the country. Shepherds and ecologists claim many of the paths 
have been destroyed by the spread of cities and towns. Madrid's lies 
along two of the north-south transhumance routes. On Monday, the flock 
will continue its march to the more temperate southwestern pastures 
of Extremadurawhere after spending the summer months in the cooler 
northern region of Leon.
