More than anyone else, Vinny Testaverde has an up-close-and-personal 
appreciation of Curtis Martin. ``If you could sit back where I am 
and watch him cut and see the hole,'' the Jets' quarterback was saying 
with a smile. ``I've never seen a back like him.'' In their history, 
the Jets have had only two running backs like him, Freeman McNeil 
and Emerson Boozer. And as good as McNeil and Boozer were, Martin 
will have a chance in Kansas City next Sunday to do something neither 
ever did _ rush for 100 yards in five consecutive games. After rambling 
for 144 against Indianapolis, 108 against Miami and 107 against New 
England, he had 101 in Sunday's 28-3 thumping of the Atlanta Falcons. 
Of those 101, his teammates and 71,573 spectators at Giants Stadium 
will remember 8 particular yards. With the Jets pinned at their own 
6-yard line late in the second quarter, Martin took a pitch from Testaverde 
and moved to his right. When no hole opened, he tap-danced to his 
left, sidestepped Falcon tacklers and slithered to the 15-yard line. 
Barry Sanders couldn't have done it any better. ``I missed my block, 
so my guy had Curtis dead to rights,'' center Kevin Mawae said later, 
``but he made 8 yards.'' For the season, Martin has now rushed for 
576 yards in his six games, a 96-yard per game average. He has also 
caught 20 passes for 192 yards, including 3 for 35 yards Sunday. That 
adds up to an average of 128 yards of total offense over his six games. 
In the only game he missed, with a damaged thigh, the Jets were awful 
in a 30-10 loss in St. Louis. The numbers attest to why Coach Bill 
Parcells was willing to surrender first-round and third-round draft 
choices to the Patriots to sign the 25-year-old Martin to a potential 
six-year, $36-million contract as a restricted free agent. ``As far 
as I'm concerned,'' Parcells has often said, ``Curtis is my first-round 
draft choice this year.'' The Patriots took two running backs with 
those choices, Robert Edwards and Tony Carter, but the Jets possess 
a premier running back who had already rushed for 3,799 yards in three 
seasons, two of them when Parcells was the Patriots' coach. ``Curtis 
has great vision, toughness, speed when he has to have it, he can 
catch the ball out of the backfield,'' said Keith Byars, the Jets 
fullback who was Martin's teammate in New England. ``He can do anything 
you ask him to.'' And do it with energy and enthusiasm. ``Curtis wants 
to please, he cares about what I think and what Mo Carthon thinks,'' 
Parcells said, referring to the Jets' running backs coach. ``He's 
got a big heart, he responds to competition. He'll die on the sword 
for you.'' Ever since Martin arrived, Parcells has rated the importance 
of 100-yard rushing games to winning. ``If you have a back rush for 
100 yards,'' the coach has said, ``you're going to win 70 percent 
of the time.'' Martin's ratio has been 100 percent _ his four 100-yard 
games have translated to four Jets victories. ``We're starting to 
become a little family now,'' Martin said, alluding to the offensive 
linemen who create the holes he scoots through. ``Just because the 
play's going to the right, you can never let your man go because I 
might be coming back that way.'' His offensive linemen, however, are 
usually too busy blocking to see Martin's runs. ``That's why I look 
forward to seeing the films on Monday,'' guard Todd Burger said. Suddenly 
the Jets are 4-3, and they were fortunate to play the Falcons, now 
5-2, when 44-year-old Steve DeBerg was Atlanta's quarterback. They 
blitzed DeBerg dizzy. It wouldn't have been that easy if Chris Chandler 
had been playing. But that's life in the National Football League. 
Take advantage of a break when you get one. With three straight victories 
at Giants Stadium after a loss to Baltimore in the home opener, nobody 
is moaning about how the Jets, who train on Long Island, must play 
in another state in a stadium named for another team. In learning 
they can win in Giants Stadium, the Jets should be able to throw that 
crutch away. What the Jets must learn now, if they are to make a run 
for the Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs, is how to win on the road consistently. 
After losing in San Francisco and St. Louis, they woke up in New England 
last Monday night. But the Chiefs, who are 4-2 going into Monday night's 
game with the Steelers, are one of the American Football Conference's 
better teams, especially in Arrowhead Stadium. The Jets can't sit 
around waiting for Parcells to spring a psychological surprise every 
week. ``We have to learn how to be self-motivated, how to play well 
without the coach breathing down our necks,'' Martin said. ``We have 
to be men in the NFL.''
