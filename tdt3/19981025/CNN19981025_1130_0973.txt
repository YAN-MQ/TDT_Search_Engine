20 years ago, airline deregulation became law. Stephanie Oswald has 
a look at its impact in today's "working ahead." In the late '70s 
airlines ruled the skies. There was control of routes and ticket prices, 
keeping fairs high and eliminating competition. During the Carter 
administration the cab was led by this man, known as the architect 
of deregulation. Nobody could fly without permission from the civil 
air naughtics board. Price competition, cutting prices, was illegal. 
The result, the airline deregulation act of 1978 signed into law by 
President Carter. With this act, airlines can reduce fairs up to 50%, 
opening up air travel to millions of Americans who would not otherwise 
be able to afford it. The department of transportation became the 
industry watchdog. Airlines took control. Over the last 20 years, 
prices have fallen when you take into account inflation by about a 
third. And travel was doubled. No new airline has taken off in the 
last two years. It's bad for consumers and it's bad for business people 
because business people's fairs have increased dramatically in the 
last two years. Is it survival of the fittest. 6 million people a 
year travel. The reason is the competitive nature of the industry. 
It's competition that may or may not make the flying public a Winner 
as we fly into the 21st century. Stephanie Oswald, CNN, reporting.
