Russia's top ministers will gather tomorrow to discuss a plan to solve 
the country's dire economic problems. Prime minister Yevgeny Primakov 
says he's been working on a economic plan that he'll make public, 
after his deputies and ministers have a chance to comment on it. Russian 
media have criticized Primakov for not presenting a recovery plan 
more quickly, but Primakov says he wants a well thought out solution.
