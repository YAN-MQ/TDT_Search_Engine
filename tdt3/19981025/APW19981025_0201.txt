Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday he hoped the new Israeli-Palestinian 
peace accord would be ``accurately and faithfully'' implemented to 
truly push forward the Middle East peace process. Arafat's comment, 
made at Cairo airport after briefing President Hosni Mubarak on the 
accord, reflects Arab skepticism that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu will live up to the agreement to withdraw from a further 
13 percent of West Bank land. The Palestinian leader met with Mubarak 
at the Unity presidential palace in Cairo. The two talked briefly 
alone, then were joined by aides. The session last one hour and 15 
minutes. Neither Arafat nor Mubarak spoke to reporters after the meeting, 
but Arafat later told reporters just before he departed for Algeria 
that the implementation of the deal was what counted. He expressed 
hope that the agreement would be ``accurately and faithfully implemented 
so that we can say that we have pushed forward the peace process and 
protected the peace of the courageous people.'' Arafat said he was 
leaving for Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia on ``quick visits ... 
aimed at discussing with the Arab leaders the recent developments.'' 
The agreement, signed Friday after marathon U.S.-mediated negotiations, 
call for Arafat to clamp stringent security measures on Palestinian 
militants to prevent attacks on Israelis in exchange for the Israeli 
withdrawal in the West Bank. Many in the Arab world have criticized 
the pact as geared too much toward Israel's security demands and too 
little toward Palestinian rights. Mubarak, who in the past has mediated 
between Israel and the Palestinians, has cautiously welcomed the agreement 
but also questioned whether Netanyahu would implement all its parts. 
In remarks Saturday, he accused Netanyahu of failing to live up to 
past peace deals. Of the six points in the 1997 Hebron accord, he 
said, ``only two points were implemented while the other four were 
ignored.''
