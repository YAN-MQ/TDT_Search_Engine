After the hoopla in the United States, a guarded shrug from much of 
the Arab world. Nothing in this region is so elusive _ or so perilous 
_ as peace. And that perhaps explains why the Wye Plantation agreement 
between Israel and the Palestinians has evoked such resounding reticence 
among Arab leaders _ who played an umpire's role at most or were left 
on distant sidelines. Running through the Arab response _ whether 
among the Islamic radicals who burned Israeli flags in Gaza or among 
less vocal and more moderate figures backing Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian 
leader _ was a common stream of mistrust in the intentions of Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and doubt about American motives. 
Only King Hussein of Jordan, summoned from cancer treatment to the 
negotiations in Maryland, and visibly sapped by chemotherapy, attached 
his personal prestige to the interim accord that emerged from nine 
tortuous days of negotiations. His eyes, some Arab commentators said, 
were as much on history's judgment of his role as a peacemaker as 
on anything else. By contrast, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the 
leader of the Arab world's most populous state, struck a far more 
cautious note. ``Let us wait and see,'' he said. ``There have been 
so many agreements that were never enforced.'' ``People and officials 
cannot help being cautious,'' said Mohammed al-Sayed Said, a senior 
researcher at Cairo's Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic 
Studies. ``There is long history and heritage of Israeli manipulation 
and nonimplementation of any of the previous agreements. ``I wonder 
who trusts Netanyahu in the Arab world. How many agreements were signed 
by him while he evaded implementation? So why not this one also?'' 
Indeed, said Mohammed Sid Ahmed, a respected commentator here, President 
Clinton ``is the main winner in this agreement'' as he struggles for 
domestic political advantage in advance of next month's elections 
in the United States. The relationship between the Arab world at large 
and the Palestinians has always been a complex one, riven by the competing 
ambitions of Arab leaders to pursue divergent goals through Palestinian 
surrogates. Even recently, Syrian-backed Palestinian movements bitterly 
criticized Arafat's peace maneuvers, reflecting President Hafez Assad's 
own fruitless quest for the return of the Golan Heights from Israel. 
Equally, though, since the political cartography of the Arab world 
was redrawn by Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf war and the subsequent, 
American-led drive for a broader peace, the ability of the Arab states 
to mold the direct relationship between Israelis and Palestinians 
has been reduced. That, in turn, has reduced Arafat's ability to seek 
a regional consensus. While Egypt and Jordan may, for differing reasons, 
help promote his cause, other Arab states pursue other agendas. ``Who 
is going to give support to Arafat?'' said Dr. Said of the Al Ahram 
center. ``Syria, with its known principle of pursuing unilateral actions, 
or Iraq or Sudan or Algeria or Libya _ who want to shoot Arafat in 
the head?'' Still, to guard his back, Arafat embarked Sunday on a 
Middle East tour that evoked memories of his earlier Lear-Jet diplomacy, 
as an insurgent leader, through Arab capitals _ traveling from Egypt 
to Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. The Wye accord, offering the 
Palestinians more land in return for greater guarantees of security 
for Israel, has played into the instinctive caution of a region where 
peace with Israel has brought hazards. Egypt's peace with Israel remains 
frigid. King Hussein has paid for Jordan's peace with Israel in the 
coinage of domestic discontent among a population that is predominantly 
Palestinian. In the annals of Middle Eastern peace diplomacy, two 
statesmen _ Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin _ have 
paid for peace with their lives. Thus, no one gets too hopeful here 
_ especially not about interim deals that not only do not settle Palestinian-Israeli 
disputes but also do not address Israel's other unfinished business 
with its neighbors Syria and Lebanon. ``The road is still long for 
for a comprehensive peace,'' said Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign 
minister. ``This necessarily requires an Israeli withdrawal from the 
Syrian Golan Heights and from southern Lebanon as well as declaring 
a Palestinian state and achieving security for all parties.'' Egypt 
itself, driven by a desire for prestige as the Arab world's heavyweight 
and with the American aid dollars to support it, has displayed the 
same ambivalence as other countries in the region. The government-owned 
Al Ahram newspaper, thus, reported at length on President Mubarak's 
telephone conversations with both Arafat and Clinton as the Wye agreement 
was being finalized. But, said one official, who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity, it did not seek a high-profile role because it did not 
want to be too closely associated with an agreement that might yet 
unravel. For all that, the agreement has introduced one novel element 
into the public visage of Middle Eastern diplomacy _ the Central Intelligence 
Agency. The agency is to referee the security relationship between 
Israelis and Palestinians, ensuring that the Palestinians live up 
to commitments to stamp out terrorism. Not too long ago, the CIA was 
widely depicted by Palestinians as a sinister player in an American-backed 
Zionist conspiracy. With the new security deal, said Walid Kazziha 
, a professor of political science at the American University of Cairo, 
Arafat has ``shouldered a great responsibility as Israel's policeman.'' 
But, said Dr. Said, the CIA's involvement might now work in the Palestinians' 
favor, ``putting an end to Israel's demands on security.''
