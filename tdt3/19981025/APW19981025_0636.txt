Waving flags and shouting secular slogans, millions of Turks took 
to the streets Sunday to celebrate the republic's 75th anniversary 
and stage a show of force against Islamic politics. ``Turkey is secular 
and will remain so,'' hundreds of thousands of chanted the capital 
marching to the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded Turkey 
as a secular republic the collapse of the Ottoman empire. The military, 
the self-appointed guardians of the secular system, showed its presence 
in the march with thousands of uniformed officers. Aiming to create 
a modern state, Ataturk curtailed religion's place in society and 
made secularism the official ideology. Today, a widening divide between 
those determined to preserve the secular tradition and supporters 
of an Islamic political movement is a source of tension. The tension 
reached a peak when an Islamic-led government was pressured into resignation 
last year by the military. The Islamic party was later disbanded for 
anti-secularism. Sunday's nationwide marches were a response to demonstrations 
this month by thousands protesting a ban on Islamic-style head scarves 
at universities. The official anniversary of the republic is on Wednesday. 
Modern Turkey faces difficulties on several other fronts as it reaches 
the age of 75. The government is battling crime, Kurdish rebels and 
reaching for a more aggressive foreign policy. Dozens of gangs members 
have been rounded up in recent weeks, following a series of scandals 
revealing that politicians and banks have been entangled in shady 
dealings with the mafia. For the last 15 years the republic has been 
engaged in a fight against autonomy-seeking Kurdish rebels in which 
close to 37,000 people died. Efforts on the diplomatic as well as 
the military front are also underway. Using threats of military action, 
Turkey last week clinched a commitment from Syria to stop sheltering 
the rebels. It was the latest sign that Turkey is abandoning its once-passive 
foreign policy. Earlier, Ankara put relations with the European Union 
on hold after it refused to consider Turkey as an EU candidate. In 
response, the EU last week proposed spending 180 million for projects 
in Turkey and included it in a list of countries for membership assessment.
