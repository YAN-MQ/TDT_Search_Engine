Twenty-one aging bears _ previously used in movies, but now kept in 
cages _ have been a given a new home in a wooded compound, the weekly 
Vasarnapi Hirek reported Sunday. The bears once starred in films, 
but because the Hungarian movie company Mafilm has fallen on hard 
times and the animals had gotten too old, they were cooped up in small 
cages in the back yard. Hearing of their plight, the mayor of Veresegyhaz, 
40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Budapest, got the municipality 
to donate a plot of land and Jozsef Kosa, Mafilm's animal trainer, 
contacted the World Society of the Protection of Animals for help. 
The organization donated ten million forints (dlrs 48,000). Artificial 
caves and a man-made lake were created in the fenced-in area, with 
many people of Veresegyhaz donating their labor. Releasing them in 
pairs, the bears have been moved to the park. Peter Hanson from WSPA's 
branch in England said in a televison report that the bears ``will 
be joined by some political refugees _ two bears from Bosnian zoos 
where they were starving.''
