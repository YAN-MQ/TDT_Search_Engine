There are, from time to time, warnings posted in theater lobbies, 
advising that strobe lights will be used or that gunshots will be 
heard. But shouldn't this trend be expanded? Shouldn't there, for 
instance, be a sign in the Helen Hayes Theater that announces, ``Warning: 
Cute monks will be featured in this production''? The Helen Hayes 
is where Michael Chepiga's ``Getting and Spending,'' a play about 
moral redemption in the age of corporate greed, opened Sunday night. 
Its cast of characters does indeed feature two monks, whose vows of 
poverty and celibacy make them all the more adorable and chuckle-worthy 
when they speak in worldly ways. Meet Brother Alfred, who, upon making 
the sign of the cross after his first entrance, announces anxiously, 
``The market closed down 47.'' Then there's Brother Thaddeus, who, 
though old and easily shocked, can't help observing, when a shapely 
woman starts to undress in the sacred halls of his monastery, ``What 
a babe.'' Thaddeus, by the way, is also partly deaf, which allows 
for topically pointed jokes inspired by his mishearing: ``law degree'' 
becomes, in his rendering, ``lot of greed.'' In fairness to Chepiga, 
a corporate lawyer making his Broadway debut as a playwright, ``Getting 
and Spending'' is not trying to be the male equivalent of ``Nunsense.'' 
(What would such a work be called? ``Monk Shines''?) Alfred and Thaddeus 
are only a sideshow in this story of a high-powered, manly lawyer 
who retreats into their monastery and the high-powered, womanly investment 
broker who lures him out of it. The presence of the good brothers, 
however, provides an accurate barometer for the overall tone of this 
play, which has been directed by John Tillinger and stars Linda Purl 
and David Rasche. ``Getting and Spending'' considers subjects to which 
philosophers have devoted whole lifetimes: the elusive nature of faith, 
the life of contemplation versus that of action, the difficulties 
of being good in a corrupt universe. But it does so with the by-the-book 
facility of a grade-B sitcom. The show aims high thematically, but 
every joke and sentiment seems to have come from a can. You can see 
why producers might have been intrigued by the idea of ``Getting and 
Spending.'' Since the announcement of the death of the selfish consumerism 
of the 1980s has turned out to be premature, why not another play 
on the ethical toll of raiding and trading? The intention seems to 
have been to create a contemporary variation on ``Other People's Money,'' 
Jerry Sterner's 1989 hit about a wicked Wall Street liquidator, but 
with a spiritual spin more appropriate to a time in which even Madonna 
has found religion. The production signals its ambitions in its opening 
seconds, when the grid of LCDs that transects James Noone's set stops 
projecting stock market figures to spell out the lines of the Wordsworth 
poem that give the play its name (``The world is too much with us, 
late and soon, getting and spending . . .''). We soon learn that at 
least one man, Richard O'Neill ( Rasche), has taken Wordsworth's admonition 
to heart. Once called ``the rightful heir to Clarence Darrow,'' this 
celebrated defense lawyer has found only emptiness in success and 
is now on the verge of taking his monastic vows. The strong-willed 
Victoria Phillips (Ms. Purl), who might be called the rightful heir 
to Michael Milken but isn't, is determined to bring Richard back to 
New York long enough to defend her against charges of insider trading, 
something of which she is indeed guilty, though not for the usual 
reasons. Most of the first act is devoted to whether Victoria will 
persuade Richard to represent her; and since it's a foregone conclusion 
that she will, there's not much for the play to do except let them 
trade insults while they fall in love. (Her to him: ``Let me tell 
you something, you macho monk.'' Him to her: ``Please spare me your 
finishing-school sociology.'') The second act is centered on the trial, 
which is replete with a curmudgeonly judge with twinkling eyes (MacIntyre 
Dixon) and a ruthless young prosecutor (Deirdre Lovejoy), whose prototypes 
can be found at any hour in the ether of reruns on cable television. 
Also on hand are Victoria's frustrated suitor (Jack Gilpin) and her 
mother (Debra Mooney), a reluctant witness for the prosecution. Tagging 
along as Richard's assistant is the ever-lovable Brother Alfred (Derek 
Smith), who confides to Victoria: ``Can you keep a secret? I'm having 
the time of my life.'' This scenario isn't unlike plots that fueled 
a host of vintage screwball film comedies, with stars like James Stewart, 
Jean Arthur, Cary Grant and Claudette Colbert. But in ``Getting and 
Spending,'' the formula seems to be the end product of years of recycling 
through other, lesser movies and television shows. There ain't nothing 
left but the bones. Despite Chepiga's evident success in his day job, 
he is unable to generate any suspense out of Richard's unorthodox 
legal stratagems. Under Tillinger's direction, the actors seem to 
have set their performances on that perky automatic pilot common to 
stars of long-running comedy series. Within these limitations, Ms. 
Purl comes off best, especially in the first act, where she carefully 
limns the contradictions of a corporate go-getter with a social conscience. 
Not that it's any consolation, but these actors aren't the first casualties 
of a dispiriting month on Broadway that has already given us Rob Bartlett's 
``More to Love,'' which turned out to have the life span of a mayfly, 
and the limp, rudderless musical ``Footloose.'' The new season's hipness 
quotient, at the moment, is somewhere below that of Kenneth W. Starr.
