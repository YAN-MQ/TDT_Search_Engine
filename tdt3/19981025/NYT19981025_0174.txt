A University of Maryland senior remained in a county jail Sunday after 
the campus police said he threatened a teaching assistant in an attempt 
to receive an A on a test he had not taken. University of Maryland 
police officers arrested Stephen Clancy Hill, a 22-year-old economics 
major, near his home in Riverdale, Md., on Oct. 14. He was charged 
with first-degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a 
felony, carrying a concealed deadly weapon and possessing a deadly 
weapon on school grounds. Hill had requested a private meeting in 
the mathematics building with a teaching assistant, Alvaro Alvarez-Parrilla, 
on Oct. 9, two days after missing the test, the police said. On Oct. 
12, they said, Hill met with Alvarez-Parrilla in his office, where 
he lifted his jacket to reveal a handgun he carried in a shoulder 
holster and threatened to ``make him disappear'' if he did not give 
Hill an A on the test. When Alvarez-Parrilla said he would not comply, 
Hill left the office without hurting him, police said. The teaching 
assistant reported the incident to the police that day. ``It was a 
real threat that we had to investigate,'' said Capt. Mary Brock of 
the University of Maryland police. The police obtained a search warrant 
for Hill's home and car, and officers arrested Hill in his car at 
a traffic intersection. A loaded 9-mm semiautomatic handgun and three 
other loaded magazines were found in Hill's car and a shoulder holster 
was recovered at his home, the officers said. Hill is being held on 
$15,000 bond at Prince George's County Detention Center. A preliminary 
hearing is scheduled for Nov. 10. The incident caused concern on the 
campus in College Park, Md. But James Bentley, a sophomore, said he 
was not surprised by the arrest. ``I had seen him carrying around 
the weapon with bullets in his pocket,'' Bentley said of Hill. ``When 
I asked him why he carried the gun, he said it was for people who 
get on his bad side.'' Hill's lawyer, Rosalyn Pugh, said: ``When the 
facts are out, I'm sure Hill will be vindicated. There's more to this 
story than meets the eye.''
