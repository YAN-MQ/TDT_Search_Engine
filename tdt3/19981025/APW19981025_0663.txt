Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday he hoped the new Israeli-Palestinian 
peace accord would be ``accurately and faithfully'' implemented to 
truly push forward the Middle East peace process. Arafat's comment, 
made at Cairo airport after briefing President Hosni Mubarak on the 
accord, reflects Arab skepticism that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu will live up to the agreement to withdraw from a further 
13 percent of West Bank land. The Palestinian leader met with Mubarak 
at the Unity presidential palace in Cairo. The two talked briefly 
alone, then were joined by aides. The session last one hour and 15 
minutes. Neither Arafat nor Mubarak spoke to reporters after the meeting, 
but Arafat later told reporters just before he departed for Algeria 
that the implementation of the deal was what counted. He expressed 
hope that the agreement would be ``accurately and faithfully implemented 
so that we can say that we have pushed forward the peace process and 
protected the peace of the courageous people.'' Arafat also briefed 
officials in Algeria on the new pact Sunday. He then flew to Morocco 
and was to travel later to Saudi Arabia. The agreement, signed Friday 
after marathon U.S.-mediated negotiations, call for Arafat to clamp 
stringent security measures on Palestinian militants to prevent attacks 
on Israelis in exchange for the Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank. 
Many in the Arab world have criticized the pact as geared too much 
toward Israel's security demands and too little toward Palestinian 
interests. Mubarak, who in the past has mediated between Israel and 
the Palestinians, has cautiously welcomed the agreement but also questioned 
whether Netanyahu would implement all its parts. In remarks Saturday, 
he accused Netanyahu of failing to live up to past peace deals. Of 
the six points in the 1997 Hebron accord, he said, ``only two points 
were implemented while the other four were ignored.'' Also Sunday, 
the Cairo-based Arab League welcomed the agreement as ``an important 
step,'' in the peace process. It called for using the ``impetus of 
this agreement'' to conclude a final peace treaty that would allow 
for the establishment of a Palestinian state. In Kuwait, the Cabinet 
issued a statement saying it hoped the agreement would move forward 
the peace process in a way to protect the rights of the Palestinian 
people. It also urged new steps in Israel's peace talks with Syria 
and Lebanon.
