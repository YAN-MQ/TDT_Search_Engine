Hermann Maier showed signs of prolonging last year's reign over the 
men's World Cup circuit, leading an Austrian sweep of the podium in 
Sunday's season-opening giant slalom. The double Olympic champion 
left his rivals in his dust, posting the fastest time in both runs, 
leaving his closest contender almost two seconds behind. Maier, reknowned 
for his ability to overcome tough course conditions, took advantage 
of the poor visibility, clocking an aggregate time of 2 minutes, 10.74 
seconds, an incredible 1.60 seconds ahead of Eberharter. ``I surprised 
myself today,'' said Maier, who won the overall World Cup crown and 
World Cup titles in super-G and giant slalom as a rookie last season. 
``I wasn't really expecting to win and espcially with such an advantage. 
My summer was so busy and you never know how the other racers are 
skiing when they're out of sight.'' Teammate Stefan Eberharter, the 
Olympic silver medallist, was runnerup with a time of 2:12.34, while 
Heinz Schilchegger was third with 2:13.08, earning his first career 
podium. ``This time I was able to have two solid runs,'' said Schilchegger, 
whose previous best result was a fourth place in Adelboden two years 
ago. ``I'm very happy as the fight within the team for a place in 
the giant slalom is so fierce.'' The three had clocked the fastest 
times in the first leg to set up an Austrian sweep with compatriot 
Josef Strobl sitting in fourth as an insurance marker. But it was 
countryman Christian Mayer who finished the day fourth with a total 
time of 2:13.13, with Strobl dropping to 19th after a disasterous 
second run. The nation's stellar performance was only an extension 
of its domination over the World Cup field last year. Last season, 
Austria's men became the first to win all of the World Cup titles 
with Andreas Schifferer winning downhill and Thomas Sykora slalom. 
The team's _ but especially Maier's _ supremacy is what sparked ugly 
rumors concerning the Austrian squad the past few months. Earlier 
in the week the Swiss daily ``Sport'' quoted Swiss ski boss Theo Nadig 
questionning Maier's rapid physical development. Nadig later softened 
his statement, saying he was just curious so he could provide the 
same methods to his team. ``It was a bit unfair for people to try 
and make us nervous just before the race,'' said Maier, who won 11 
World Cup races last year. ``But the rumors in the Swiss papers had 
little effect on us, I managed to stay focused.'' ``We were a bit 
more disturbed and upset when the same type of rumors showed up in 
a Italian newspaper this summer.'' Two-time World Cup champion Michael 
Von Gruenigen, sixth after the first run, moved up a spot after the 
second, with a time of 2:13.28. The Olympic bronze medallist, who 
injured his ankle playing basketball this summer, had resumed training 
just two weeks ago after a six week recovery period. Germany's Markus 
Eberle, who barely made the top 30 in the first leg to qualify, had 
the second-fastest time in the final run, holding the lead until Austrian 
Hans Knauss posted an identical two-run chrono of 2:13.35. In the 
end Eberle moved up to a spectacular sixth place. Strong winds and 
heavy snow had forced race officials to delay the start of the race 
by more than two hours, while workers cleared the course and re-erected 
the start hut, which had been blown down overnight. After the weekend 
races, the season takes almost a month off before resuming for three 
weekends of racing in North America beginning in Park City, Utah, 
Nov. 19-22 with men's and women's slalom and giant slalom. The circuit 
returns to Europe Dec. 10-13 in Val d'Isere, France, for men's downhill 
and super-G and women's super-G and giant slalom.
