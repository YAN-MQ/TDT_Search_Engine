John G. Gude, an agent who represented many prominent figures in broadcasting 
and publishing, died on Oct. 11 at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Massachusetts 
after a fall at Long Hill Nursing Home in Edgartown, Mass. He was 
96. Over the years, Gude's clients included Edward R. Murrow, Walter 
Cronkite, William Shirer, Andy Rooney, Fred Friendly, Elmer Davis 
and James Thurber. Born in Montclair, N.J., Gude was a graduate of 
Brown University. He joined the CBS News department in the 1930s, 
writing publicity releases and editing news broadcasts. Shortly thereafter, 
with Thomas Stix, he formed the Stix &AMP; Gude agency, which represented 
radio news personalities, including Murrow, during World War II. After 
the war, Gude brought Murrow and Friendly together for the production 
of ``I Can Hear It Now,'' a recording of historic events conceived 
by Friendly and narrated by Murrow. The success of the recording led 
to a radio series and then to the ``See It Now'' television program, 
which ran on CBS from 1952 to 1955. Gude's wife, Helen, died in September 
at 94. He is survived by two sons, Jonathan and David; a daughter, 
Elizabeth, of Chilmark, Mass.; and three grandchildren.
