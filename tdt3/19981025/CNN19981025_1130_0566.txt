The federal government's antitrust suit against Microsoft centers 
on the software giant's Internet browser and its rival Netscape. Ann 
Kellan reports on Netscape's efforts to win over consumers. When Microsoft 
wove its web browser, Internet explorer, into its Windows 98 operating 
system, Netscape, with its competing browser, cried unfair and has 
been trying to get even with Microsoft, not only in the courtroom, 
but with a new version of its browser Netscape communicator 4.5. They're 
delighted to see Microsoft in the hot seat. As far as the new version, 
I think it's better than Internet explorer. So, yeah, I think they're 
getting even pushing ahead. If you load Microsoft's Windows 98 on 
your computer, odds are you'll end up trying Microsoft's web browser 
but -- Netscape is trying to even the odds with Microsoft's Internet 
explorer, and get you to use netscape as your primary browser. These 
boxes are checked. You can uncheck them. But having them checked, 
Netscape becomes your browser. Any software program like this encyclopedia, 
will automatically link to the internet through the default browser. 
So is there a better browser? "Technology" editor Bill husted finds 
the new version of Netscape faster but -- It's almost like the difference 
between a Chevrolet and a Ford. There's not a great difference in 
the two products. It's more being familiar with one and just, you 
tend to stay with the same one you've used. Both, he says, are big 
and bulky, and Netscape could take an hour to install. Each product 
gets loaded with new features and most of us just want to cruise the 
dang web. Ironically so, as the competition wages on between the two 
browser giants, husted sings the praise of yet another browser called 
opera. Takes up half the space in your computer and runs twice as 
fast. Ann Kellan, "Headline News."
