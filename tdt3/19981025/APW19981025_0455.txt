A group of Chilean immigrants who lost family members during Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet's rule sought Sunday to have the former dictator 
charged with mureder and kidnapping in Sweden. Pinochet is in a London 
hospital, where he was arrested this month after spinal surgery on 
a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on charges of genocide, 
terrorism and torture during his 17-year regime. His lawyers are to 
go to the British High Court on Monday to seek to have the arrest 
invalidated. The Swedish group Association of Relatives of Disappeared 
Political Prisoners on Sunday went to a Stockholm police station to 
file three relatives' complaints of murder and kidnapping. Group spokesman 
Jose Miguel Cortez said more complaints could be in the works, but 
said the group decided on the unusual move of filing quickly on Sunday 
in light of the possibility of a decision in Britain on Monday. There 
was no immediate decision on the complaints. Courts were closed on 
Sunday and Justice Ministry spokesman Bjoern Lindh said it was not 
immediately clear is Sweden would consider itself to have jurisdiction 
in such cases. ''We hope they take a stand,'' Cortez said. '' One 
of those filing a complaint was Javier Munoz, who said his sister, 
her husband, the husband's father and a brother disappeared in April 
1976 in Santiago, the Chilean capital. The men were members of the 
Chilean Communist Party, an illegal acitivity at the time, and the 
husband, Luis Emilio Recabarren, was a prominent labor activist, Munoz 
said. According to Munoz, the two younger men and the woman were arrested 
at a bus-stop along with Recabarren's 1-year-old son. The boy was 
later left near the house of his grandfather; when he heard the boy's 
cries about 3 a.m. he went out to look for him and was arrested, Munoz 
said. ''It's more than just pain,'' Munoz said through an interpreter. 
''We want nothing more than justice, but nothing less.''
