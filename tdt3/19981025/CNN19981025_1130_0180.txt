President Clinton hopes his mideast success will help his fellow democrats 
in November's congressional elections. Carl Rochelle reports on President 
Clinton's latest fund-raising trip. President Clinton came to California 
to make up a number of campaign appearances, postponed because of 
his personal role in the nine-day mideast summit. And with the White 
House signing ceremony still fresh in almost everyone's mind, he invoked 
the image of that ceremony at a private fund-raiser, out of range 
of cameras, in a call to democratic voters. If you really like that, 
and you really believe that public life and citizenship is about the 
victories we win for or children, our future and for our common humanity, 
then you get everybody you can to get out and vote november 3rd. The 
success at the bargaining table has, at least for awhile, blunted 
criticism about whether Mr. Clinton was able to do his job in the 
face of distractions over the Monica Lewinsky affair and the upcoming 
impeachment hearings. And while some political analysts believe democrats 
will benefit, one key republican seems unconcerned. It probably brings 
democrats that may have been a little bit disillusioned by the Monica 
Lewinsky mess, makes them more likely to turn out. It gives democrats 
a little bump. It's not huge, it will probably help a little bit. 
Remember in 1992, democrats were the majority. They lost 53 house 
seats, 12 Senate seats and 500 legislative seats already. I think 
you will see them lose more seats. I think the result will be fairly 
good for us. a little help could go a long way for some embattled 
democrats, but President Clinton is trying to do even more. He wraps 
up his two-day California trip Sunday in San Francisco, where the 
White House says he will raise another $1 million for senator Barbara 
boxer, who is fighting an uphill battle in her bid for re-election.
