in the finale of the Kremlin cup. Seles, who had beaten Pierce five 
times in their previous six matches, could not keep up with Pierce's 
hard serves and fierce cross-court baseline shots. The numbers -- 
7-6, 6-3. For the first time in 22 years, a Spaniard won the men's 
indoor in Lyons. Alex corretja beating Germany's Tommy Haas in the 
final. The French open runner-up pulled off a 2-6, 7-6, 6-1 win. Also,
