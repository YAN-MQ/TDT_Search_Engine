A Japanese volcano that killed 700 people in the 17th century is erupting 
again. No one has been hurt this time. Mt.Komagatake sent a 2,300-foot 
plume of smoke into the air today, but no lava flow is reported. Ash 
coated cars in a town six miles away. The 3,700-foot volcano last 
erupted two years ago. It's located on Japan's largest northern island.
