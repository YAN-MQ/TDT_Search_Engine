Prelimnary autopsy results indicate a top Angolan general died of 
cerebral malaria and not of poisoning as hardline members of his former 
rebel group have claimed. Gen. Arlindo Chenda Pena, a former commander 
of Angola's UNITA rebels who later joined the government under a 1994 
peace accord, died at a South African hospital on Oct. 19 at age 42. 
He had arrived from Angola already in critical condition. Both UNITA 
hardliners and dissidents who have split with the rebel movement claimed 
Pena was poisoned, but preliminary post-mortem results indicate cerebral 
malaria killed him, The Sunday Indepednent reported. Lab tests for 
final autopsy results won't be completed for another two weeks, the 
Johannesburg newspaper said.
