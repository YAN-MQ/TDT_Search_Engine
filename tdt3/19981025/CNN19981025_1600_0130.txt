The mideast deal was almost scuttled at the last minute because of 
Jonathan pollard who was convicted of stealing U.S. intelligence information 
for israel. He was arrested in 1985 and sentenced to life in prison. 
But prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded the U.S. release pollard. 
President Clinton has promised to review his case. Today, the issue 
was debated on the air waves. I think in view of the strong feeling 
of Netanyahu on this, the president felt he would be willing to take 
a fresh review of it without any commitments, without any agreements, 
without any prior judgments to prime minister Netanyahu. We will do 
that. We will listen to what our attorney general has to say, our 
military people has to say, our intelligence community and others. 
The president clearly determined he could not make a clear judgment 
on that issue in the context of these negotiations without a complete 
review of the record. The president, a year ago when he refused to 
grant Clemency to Mr. pollard, said this was one of the most serious 
crimes committed against the United States. The president was right 
then. It would be outrageous to release Mr. pollard. It would be outrageous 
to release Mr. pollard. He has nothing to do with the Middle East 
peace process, and if he does, there is something wrong with our foreign 
policy.
