Down to his last straw when the PGA Tour season began, John Huston 
is having a year he wishes would never end. Huston, who decided to 
use a one-time exemption instead of returning to qualifying school 
last year, won his second tournament of the year Sunday by closing 
with a 6-under-par 66 for a one-stroke victory over Davis Love III. 
Starting the day four strokes behind Love, Huston caught him with 
a brilliant display of accuracy. He hit every green in regulation 
in the final round, was 3-under on the par 5s and took the lead for 
good with a 7-iron into 3 feet (a meter) for birdie on the 16th. Love 
had a chance to catch him with booming drives on the last two holes, 
but he didn't give himself a decent birdie try with an 8-iron and 
a 9-iron in his hands. ``I'm thrilled to be in this position,'' Huston 
said. The only guy who may have felt as good as Huston was Larry Rinker. 
The final full-field tournament of the year determined the top 125 
players on the money list who keep their full-exempt cards for 1999. 
Rinker, 135th going into the Disney, closed with seven straight pars 
for a 68 that left him in a tie for 12th. He made dlrs 42,000 and 
moved up to 120th. ``It was a big day for me, a day I needed to perform,'' 
Rinker said. ``I was fortunate I did.'' Blaine McCallister shot a 
66 in the final round and got the 125th spot on the money list by 
dlrs 4,204 over P.H. Horgan III. Huston won dlrs 360,000 to put him 
at dlrs 1.4 million, by far his best season in 11 years on tour. He 
also moved up to 13th in the Presidents Cup standings, giving him 
a good chance to make the team with a strong showing next week in 
the Tour Championship. Love, who opened with a 73, started the final 
round with a three-stroke lead and had a chance early on to put distance 
between him and the rest of the field. Already 1-under for the day, 
his bunker shot for eagle on the par-5 fourth hole ran over the lip. 
Then he three-putted from about 8 feet for bogey. ``That probably 
was a killer,'' Love said. Brent Geiberger had the best round of the 
day, a 7-under 65 that moved him up to third at 13-under 275. Jesper 
Parnevik, Tom Purtzer and Rocco Mediate were another stroke back. 
Glen Day and Doug Martin, roommates at the University of Oklahoma, 
started the final round paired with Love and needing to make up three 
strokes. Martin was the first to catch him with birdies on the first 
three holes, but he finished with two straight bogeys for a 72 and 
was at 277, tied with Tiger Woods. Day shot a 73 to finish at 278. 
``I didn't hit very good irons, and that was the difference,'' Love 
said. ``I didn't give myself enough makeable birdie putts.'' That 
wasn't a problem for Huston. His iron play was remarkably consistent 
_ he missed only seven greens over 72 holes, and he played the final 
33 holes without a bogey. That's a far cry from a year ago, when Huston 
became so frustrated with nagging shoulder and wrist injuries _ not 
to mention his play _ that he took the last four weeks off. Instead 
of going back to Q-school, Huston decided to take his one-time exemption 
for being in the top 50 on the career money list. ``Mentally, I was 
shot,'' he said. ``Taking the time off was a big turnaround for me.'' 
That much was clear in the fourth tournament of the year, when Huston 
set the PGA Tour scoring record in relation to par _ 28-under 260 
to win the Hawaiian Open. ``It certainly worked out great,'' he said. 
Huston still holds the tournament scoring record at Disney, a 26-under 
262 when he won in 1992. He didn't have to go that low to win Sunday.
