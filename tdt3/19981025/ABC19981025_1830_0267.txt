Dr. Barnett slepian will be buried tomorrow. He was murdered Friday 
night by a sniper. Police are investigating the possibility that Dr. 
slepian was the victim of an organized terror campaign against doctors 
who perform abortions. ABC's Bill Redeker reports. Two days after 
an assassin murders Dr. Barnett slepian, police in western New York 
and southeastern Canada have few clues and no suspects. But they believe 
slepian is the latest victim of a four-year campaign in this region 
against abortion providers on both sides of the border. The situation 
is so strikingly similar, it certainly is a possibility that they 
are linked. Slepian was killed Friday night by a sniper who fired 
a single shot through the doctor's kitchen window. Four other abortion 
providers have been wounded by sniper fire since 1994 during the weeks 
leading up to Canada's veteran's day on November 11th. Slepian had 
been warned about possible violence but took no special precautions. 
In all, six law enforcement agencies from two countries are now involved 
in the investigation. Still, there is the feeling both here and in 
Canada that another abortion provider could be targeted in the coming 
weeks. We don't feel safe. Just because we had one, we don't feel 
that this group or organization or individual is necessarily finished. 
An anti-abortion group that published slepian's name on an internet 
page called "the Nuremberg files" denied today that it was in any 
way responsible. But Neal horsley, who operates Christian gallery 
web site, readily admits that he personally scratched off slepian's 
name only nine hours after he was killed. We hope that the day will 
come when those who are involved in the abortion business, killing 
God's children, will, in fact, be brought to trial. That sort of religious 
zealotry was condemned today in several churches here. Reverend Thomas 
yorty denounced those who use religion to justify violence. The person 
who killed Dr. slepian and those who support such acts while they 
presume God's blessing have little contact with the God of mercy. 
Tomorrow, funeral services, and a promise from police that they will 
reveal what, if anything, they have learned about who took Dr. slepian's 
life. Bill Redeker, ABC News, Amherst, New York.
