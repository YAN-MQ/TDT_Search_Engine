Traffic in central Madrid came to a halt Sunday as an estimated 2,000 
sheep were herded through the city as part of an annual procession 
to highlight the need to protect Spain's ancient grazing roots. With 
bleating interspersed with the tinkling of bells making a welcome 
substitute from the customary car horns of this busy city, dozens 
of people lined the sidewalks as the merinos trotted through central 
Madrid and on to the city's southwestern outskirts. The protest, staged 
each October for the past five years, highlights the need for authorities 
to protect Spain's 125,000 kilometers (78,000 miles) of transhumance 
paths _ some dating back 800 years _ which are used for the seasonal 
movement of livestock from different grazing grounds around the country. 
Shepherds and ecologists claim many of the paths have been destroyed 
by the spread of cities and towns. Madrid lies along two of the north-south 
grazing routes. On Monday, the flock was to continue its march to 
the more temperate southwestern pastures of Extremadura.
