Archaeologists in the Central Asian nation of Tajikistan have found 
a road paved with alabaster that dates from Alexander the Great's 
empire in the 4th century B.C., a news report said Sunday. The road 
led to a temple that combined Greek culture brought by Alexander with 
local traditions, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Anzhelina Druzhinina, 
head of the archaeological team, as saying. The site is in strife-torn 
southern Tajikistan near the Pyandzh River, which runs between the 
impoverished former Soviet republic and Afghanistan. The road was 
made of alabaster and crushed stone covered with clay putty, Druzhinina 
said. The archaeologists have excavated a section of the road and 
parts of the temple, but she said they have no money to finish the 
work. Alexander, king of Macedon, united Greece under his command 
and then headed east in 334 B.C. for what became the greatest conquest 
of ancient times. Winning battle after battle, he reached northeastern 
India before turning back towards Egypt, where he died of fever in 
323 B.C. at age 33.
