Down to his last straw when the PGA Tour season began, John Huston 
is having a year he wishes would never end. Huston, who decided to 
use a one-time exemption instead of returning to qualifying school 
last year, won his second tournament of the year Sunday by closing 
with a 6-under-par 66 for a one-stroke victory over Davis Love III. 
Starting the day four strokes behind Love, Huston caught him with 
a brilliant display of accuracy. He hit every green in regulation 
in the final round, was 3-under on the par 5s and took the lead for 
good with a 7-iron into 3 feet (a meter) for birdie on the 16th. Love 
had a chance to catch him with booming drives on the last two holes, 
but he didn't give himself a decent birdie try with an 8-iron and 
a 9-iron in his hands. ``I'm thrilled to be in this position,'' Huston 
said. The only guy who may have felt as good as Huston was Larry Rinker. 
The final full-field tournament of the year determined the top 125 
players on the money list who keep their full-exempt cards for 1999. 
Rinker, 135th going into the Disney, closed with seven straight pars 
for a 68 that left him in a tie for 12th. He made dlrs 42,000 and 
moved up to 120th. ``It was a big day for me, a day I needed to perform,'' 
Rinker said. ``I was fortunate I did.'' Blaine McCallister shot a 
66 in the final round and got the 125th spot on the money list by 
dlrs 4,204 over P.H. Horgan III. Huston won dlrs 360,000 to put him 
at dlrs 1.4 million, by far his best season in 11 years on tour. He 
also moved up to 12th in the Presidents Cup standings, giving him 
a good chance to make the team with a strong showing next week in 
the Tour Championship. Love, who ... Picks up 11th graf pvs
