Extra-dimensional beings, disasters foretold and government conspiracies 
are standard fare on Art Bell's late-night radio talk show. In the 
last two weeks, though, the host provided listeners with a mystery 
of his own, signing off his nationally syndicated program in the small 
hours of Oct. 13 by saying that a life-threatening event meant this 
would be his last broadcast. Alarmed listeners, who apparently thought 
Bell was in physical danger, called a sheriff's office near the host's 
isolated desert home and studio in Pahrump, Nev. The sheriff, Wade 
Lieseke Jr., found him safe and unharmed. ``It's got nothing to do 
with government threats or aliens,'' Lieseke said. ``It's been taken 
way out of context.'' But the broadcast by the nation's fourth-most-listened-to 
radio host set off a two-week whirl of conspiracy theories and counter-theories. 
Many of Bell's 6 million weekly listeners started phoning and faxing 
the 400 affiliates nationwide that carried his five-hour nightly marathon. 
In radio industry circles, cynics sniped that the broadcast was a 
hoax to break a contract or to lay the groundwork for an increase 
in advertising rates. On the Internet, the editor of the online publication 
Ufoseek declared that Bell quit rather than compromise over the program's 
creative control. One satirist put out a mocking news article reporting 
that Bell was abducted by aliens and that President Clinton had ordered 
a Delta Force rescue mission. Bell solved a portion of the mystery 
last Friday night, saying he would return this Wednesday to the broadcast, 
acquired earlier this year for $10 million by Jacor Communications 
Inc. ``While all the difficulties that caused me to so unexpectedly 
and quickly leave the air haven't been resolved yet, they remain as 
grave as any family could face,'' he said in a prerecorded segment 
played during his show, which has been broadcast since Oct. 13 with 
a substitute host. But the mystery continues to the extent that he 
has declined to elaborate on his crisis, saying its disclosure would 
only make matters worse. ``This was not a hoax or a stunt,'' Bell 
said. ``This was and is a family crisis, period.'' As Orson Welles' 
famous ``War of the Worlds'' broadcast in October 1938 proved, radio 
listeners can mistake fiction for fact. Bell's audience may have jumped 
to fanciful conclusions because his talk-show topics are the equivalent 
of urban campfire stories, said Walter Sabo, a talk-radio programming 
consultant in New York. ``If he was a deejay doing a normal show and 
said, `I have to take time off for my family,' no one would notice,'' 
Sabo said. ``Coming out of his mouth, we assume it's aliens.''
