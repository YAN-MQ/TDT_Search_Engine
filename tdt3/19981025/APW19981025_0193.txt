The European Union leaders planned to wrap up a summit Sunday with 
a pledge to end by next Spring months of fruitless talks about reforming 
the EU ahead of its enlargement. The impetus to crank the slow-as-molasses 
reform drive into high gear came on Saturday from Gerhard Schroeder. 
The incoming German chancellor set a five-month timetable to amend 
the EU charter so the now 15-member union can admit a dozen newcomers 
and not choke on its own red tape. Reforms touch on cutting subsidies 
to farmers, revamping EU finances and giving the union a stronger 
defense and foreign policy profile. British Prime Minister Tony Blair 
outlined his views on a new defense role for Europe, to prevent a 
recurrence of the EU's ``dithering and disunity'' over Kosovo. Schroeder's 
center-left coalition takes office Tuesday, ending 16 years of Helmut 
Kohl's conservative christian democratic rule. His debut here and 
that of Massimo D'Alema, an ex-communist sworn in last week as Italian 
premier, gives the line-up of the West European leaders a stronger 
leftist tint. The EU leaders agreed emphasis should be put on sustaining 
Europe's growth through the current world economic crisis. ``Reducing 
unemployment is the most important single question for the people 
of Europe,'' Schroeder said Saturday. The EU's ranks of the unemployed 
total 18 million. On Jan. 1, Germany assumes the EU presidency and 
must bring months of debate about reforming the EU to a conclusion. 
Sweeping and painful reforms must be adopted in the EU budget and 
new decision-making rules must be written to update archaic ones dating 
back to the 1950s when there were six members. These issues have been 
around for many months without an agreement. Schroeder urged his partners 
to settle on ``a draft package of solutions'' at a mid-December summit 
in Vienna, adding, ``I do not exclude calling a special summit at 
the end of February to move matters forward.'' The reform talks have 
so far been fruitless because of the scope of proposals: farm subsidy 
cuts of up to 30 percent, more majority voting eroding national sovereignty 
and overhauling the budget to end complaints from Germany, Austria, 
Sweden and the Netherlands they pay too much for EU membership. Blair 
overturned the policy of his Conservative predecessors by calling 
for the EU to develop its own defense capability to tackle wildfire 
conflicts on its doorstep like Kosovo or Bosnia without having to 
rely on U.S. support. Rudolf Scharping, who takes over as German defense 
minister Tuesday, said he had already had talks with his British and 
French counterparts to discuss Blair's ideas. On economic measures, 
some leaders urged the launch of ``New Deal'' type public works projects 
to create jobs and called on central bankers to boost business by 
cutting interest rates. Schroeder said Germany's Social Democratic 
and Green coalition partners ``have made the fight against unemployment 
the central point of our European policy,'' Schroeder said. ``Priority 
must go to Europe-wide coordination of economic, financial and social 
policies.'' To boost the economy, Scharping said EU governments should 
enter into ``a dialogue'' with central bank governors to convince 
them to decrease rates. Central banks in the EU's core economies, 
notably Germany and France, have resisted that so far, claiming they 
are already among the world's lowest. Although the leaders rallied 
behind the call for more growth, there was less unity over how to 
do it. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin revived a plan for the 
EU to raise loans to finance public works projects such as trans-continental 
road and rail links.
