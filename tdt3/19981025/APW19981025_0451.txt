Kidnappers released a Brazilian pop singer Sunday after realizing 
they had seized the wrong person, police said. The gang considered 
killing Roberto Souza Rocha, 25, known as Latino, after capturing 
him Saturday, detective Alvaro Lins said in a televised interview. 
``The kidnappers had wanted someone else and did not know what to 
do with him,'' said Lins. Rocha eventually was dumped at a railroad 
station on the poor northern outskirts of Rio. Rocha was hospitalized 
Sunday with a broken arm, the Globo TV network reported. A search 
for the singer started after his abandoned jeep was found near Rio's 
airport. He had been driving there to catch a flight to northeastern 
Brazil for a concert. Rocha has made three records since 1994. The 
most popular was ``Me Leva,'' (or ``Take Me'' in Portugese), which 
sold 500,000 copies.
