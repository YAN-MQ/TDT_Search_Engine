It was all white men on the Supreme Court who handed down the milestone 
rulings that helped decide the fate of American Indians more than 
a century ago. Now, here at the University of Kansas School of Law, 
Indian lawyers are acting out a legal ``what if'' experiment: What 
if Indians had been on the Supreme Court of the 1800s? Eight American 
Indian lawyers gathered here on Oct. 10 and played the roles of justices 
in an elaborate moot court. The panel heard a full ``reargument'' 
of one of the most important of the early Supreme Court cases, Cherokee 
Nation vs. Georgia. In the 1831 decision, Chief Justice John Marshall 
ruled that tribes were not foreign nations entitled to be dealt with 
equally but mere ``domestic dependent nations.'' The ruling in Georgia's 
favor laid the legal foundation for much that was to come in America's 
relations with the Indians. The reconsideration of the case is not 
a carefree task. Years ago in law school at the University of Wisconsin, 
said Laura Soap, one of the moot court justices, she felt no emotion 
as she studied the famous Supreme Court rulings dealing with Indians. 
But as the arguments have been replayed in the moot court, she said, 
``I find myself getting a little angry, the more I think about it. 
I find myself thinking: How am I going to explain this to my kids?'' 
Ms. Soap is a Kickapoo Indian; her husband is a Cherokee. The moot 
court judges surprised no one by announcing after the arguments that, 
this time, the Cherokee Nation had won. But, just like real justices, 
the eight Indian lawyers are deliberating over a written opinion to 
justify their decision. It is to be published in a law review. At 
the invitation of a reporter, Ms. Soap and another of the justices, 
Russell Brien, a member of the Iowa tribe, met at the law school to 
hash out their views in the drafting of an opinion the way real judges 
might. On a bright Kansas afternoon, they struggled with the history 
of the legal system's treatment of their people. Marshall concluded 
167 years ago that, no matter how real their grievances might be, 
tribes could not appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling left the 
tribes with no redress for acts like the breaking of treaties and 
the forced removal of native people from their homelands. Ms. Soap, 
38, is an associate justice of the real Supreme Court of the Sac and 
Fox Nation of Kansas and Missouri. If she had the chance to hear the 
Cherokee case, she said, she would try to be practical in contending 
with Marshall's view that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to 
hear the Cherokees' case. Perhaps she could concede, she said, that 
the Indians could not enforce their treaties. But closing the door 
of the country's highest court to Indians, she said, diminished the 
ideals of America. ``I would talk to Marshall,'' she said, ``and I 
would say: `Maybe the treaties are no good. But we need to do it the 
way the Americans do it: We need to have the issues heard in court.' 
'' In real life, Brien, 32, is a lawyer in a Kansas City firm who 
works on repackaging mortgage loans as securities. He tried a legalistic 
approach to the Cherokees' case. ``Clearly the Indians were here first,'' 
Brien said. ``The Indians' title to the land has not been extinguished.'' 
He said that one way to deal with Marshall's view was to convince 
him that if the court did not treat the Indians' claims as legitimate 
in 1831, the Indians' anger could fester for a long time. ``You might 
as well address it now, rather than wait till later,'' Brien said. 
Before the meeting of the two justices, the professor who convened 
the moot court, Robert Porter, had explained the goal of the exercise. 
Porter, a Harvard-educated lawyer and a member of the Seneca Nation, 
is the director of the Tribal Law and Government Center at the law 
school here. As Indian nations across the country struggle to reassert 
their sovereign powers over their own people, he said, Indian lawyers 
must study the way America used the law to establish what he called 
colonial domination. The moot court and similar exercises, he said, 
are intended ``to lay the intellectual foundation for our decolonization.'' 
It is not an easy task. Brien and Ms. Soap said that as lawyers trained 
in the American system, it was nearly impossible for them to view 
the Cherokees' case of 1831 with anything like the eyes of their ancestors. 
Brien said that his family left the reservation years ago and he had 
only become involved in tribal matters in recent years. As he learned 
his tribe's modern legal system, he said, he discovered that over 
the generations it had come to mirror the American system. Older ways, 
he said, had been forgotten. ``I don't have my tribe's dispute resolution 
system. That's lost to me,'' he said. ``And I am still in the process 
of trying to learn my tribe's traditions.''
