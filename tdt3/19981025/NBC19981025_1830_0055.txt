Good evening. In the mideast tonight, the effort to get the new peace 
plan ratified revs into high gear as Israeli and Palestinian hard-liners 
step up their opposition. It's a battle that will be waged in the 
corridors of power and on the street. As NBC's Martin Fletcher reports, 
a vocal minority is trying to scuttle a Plan the majority supports. 
a hero's welcome for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he returned 
home today. An opinion poll said 74% of Israelis support the agreement 
with the palestinians. I think it's a much better proposal, a much 
better blueprint for peace. Fighting terrorism, in collecting illegal 
weapons and stopping the incitement. These are all things that were 
absent in the original formulation. But just up the road from the 
airport, a different welcome. Louder voices threatening violence. 
Right-wing Jews who call the deal a sellout. I am protesting against 
the agreement. Terror will rise. The agreement is turning Israeli 
politics upside down. The right wing, Netanyahu's main supporters, 
are mobilizing, hoping to topple Netanyahu and force new elections 
to kill the deal. While the opposition says they'll support Netanyahu 
to make sure the agreement survives. We are going to provide the prime 
minister with an ad hoc safety net for the agreement to be approved. 
It's just as bad for Yasser Arafat. While he's touring the Arab world 
to gather support, at home his police today clashed with his own people 
an ominous sign of conflict to come among palestinians. Palestinian 
police fired on Palestinian protesters, shooting one man in the head 
after police searched offices for illegal weapons -- a first attempt 
to carry out their obligations under the peace deal. This man says, 
they should not have fired guns at us. It should not have come to 
this. Islamic militants say if the police try to take their guns away, 
there could be civil war. This week Netanyahu faces a vote of no confidence 
in parliament, while arafat faces charges from his people that he's 
become Israel's policeman. Making the deal was hard enough, but making 
it stick will be much tougher. Martin Fletcher, NBC news, Tel Aviv.
