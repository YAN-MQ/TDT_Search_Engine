A majority of Israelis support the new agreement with the Palestinians, 
according to a poll published by an Israeli newspaper Sunday. The 
accord was signed Friday at the White House by Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Its main 
points are a partial Israeli pullback in the West Bank and increased 
Palestinian security measures. Asked their opinion about the agreement, 
74 percent of the Israelis polled said they supported it, while 18 
percent were opposed. Eight percent expressed no opinion. The poll 
appeared in the Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot. Netanyahu faces a political 
battle to get the agreement through his Cabinet and parliament. Many 
of the hardliners who backed Netanyahu when he was elected in 1996 
oppose the accord, while his moderate political opponents support 
it. The poll of 505 Israeli adults was conducted by the local Dahaf 
agency. It said the margin of error was 4.5 percentage points.
