Driving rain squalls spawned by Hurricane Mitch _ a dangerous storm 
with 150-mph (240-kph) winds _ forced churches to cancel Sunday services 
and flooded some streets in the Jamaican capital Sunday. Under dark, 
menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis stayed off Kingston's 
streets as Mitch, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, 
swirled in the western Caribbean Sea. Mitch, a powerful Category 4 
hurricane, could also threaten the Cayman Islands, Cuba, Honduras 
and Colombia's tiny islands off Central America, the U.S. National 
Hurricane Center said. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman 
Islands and eastern Cuba, and a hurricane watch was in effect for 
the tourist islands of the Caymans. At 2100 GMT, Mitch was about 190 
miles (305 kilometers) south-southwest of Grand Cayman. Crawling west-northwest 
at 8 mph (13 kph), its hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph (118 
kph) extended 70 miles (110 kilometers) from the center. Sheets of 
rain reduced visibility to a few yards (meters) as squalls pelted 
Kingston and Jamaica's eastern districts. With rain expected at least 
through Monday, authorities warned of mudslides and flash floods, 
especially in the mountains. Residents cleared shelves of bakery items, 
batteries and other goods at the few Kingston markets open Sunday, 
though by mid-afternoon the hurricane appeared to be moving farther 
away from Jamaica. Several airlines canceled flights, although the 
Kingston and Montego Bay airports remained open. In the Cayman Islands, 
a British colony of about 28,000, some boat owners secured their vessels 
and residents stocked up on food, water, batteries and other essentials. 
The government allowed markets _ normally closed by law on Sunday 
_ to open and ordered public works employees to report to work. The 
annual Pirates Festival and street parade was rescheduled for next 
weekend, and a planned release of 400 endangered green sea turtle 
hatchlings from Grand Cayman was postponed indefinitely. In Cuba, 
civil defense authorities began warning citizens in the eastern part 
of the island on Sunday. Cuba's eastern half was battered by Hurricane 
Georges one month ago. Information about the hurricane's location 
and movement was broadcast on national and regional television and 
radio stations. Civil defense warning centers, which oversee evacuations 
and temporary shelters, were activated. In western Jamaica, hoteliers 
and tourists kept a wary eye on the storm's progress. ``It's not a 
very good beach day,'' said Rohan Watson, a manager at the Negril 
Inn in the western resort of Negril. Employees had stockpiled food 
and plywood to board windows in case Mitch threatened, he said. ``People 
are still coming in. I think most people think the weather's going 
to pass,'' said an optimistic Marcia Tomlinson, a receptionist at 
the Montego Bay hotel in the northwestern coastal resort of Montego 
Bay. Jamaica was last struck by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, which killed 
45 people. But the island was spared by Hurricane Georges, a storm 
that killed more than 500 during its rampage through the northeast 
Caribbean last month.
