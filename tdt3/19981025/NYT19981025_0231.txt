He has said repeatedly that he wants to debate, plans to debate and 
hopes to debate. But just nine days before the election, Gov. George 
Pataki has yet to actually commit to a debate against his Democratic 
opponent, Peter Vallone. Pataki has said only that their campaigns 
are working on the arrangements. The latest invitation to Pataki came 
Sunday, as Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV wrapped up the debate between 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer. Pressman, the moderator, 
said that the station had invited the governor and Vallone, the only 
statewide candidates who have not debated yet, to do so next Sunday. 
``We hope that in the interests of the voters, both candidates for 
governor will be here,'' Pressman said. ``That is, they'll show up.'' 
Vallone has said that he will, but it is far from certain what Pataki 
will do. John Sparks, who handles WNBC-TV's political coverage, said 
that Pataki's campaign manager, Zenia Mucha, told him Sunday that 
the governor had another engagement the next Sunday. If Pataki did 
not appear, Sparks said, Vallone would be given half an hour of broadcasting 
time. But Ms. Mucha said Sunday that the campaign had not yet decided 
about the debate. ``We haven't ruled anything in and we haven't ruled 
anything out,'' she said. Asked what she was waiting for, Ms. Mucha 
said: ``We've made it perfectly clear that a debate should consist 
of a discussion of the issues important to the state. Vallone has 
failed to demonstrate that he has any knowledge of or interest in 
those issues. Misrepresentations and personal attacks have been the 
mainstay of his campaign.'' Ms. Mucha said that if Vallone ceased 
those attacks, debates would be scheduled. Peter Ragone, a spokesman 
for Vallone, did not respond to Ms. Mucha's contention that Vallone 
had been on the attack. He made his own attack: ``George Pataki has 
spent this entire campaign ducking subpoenas, ducking debates, ducking 
reality and there's no end in sight.'' Vallone, speaker of the New 
York City Council, has said that he will debate the governor at any 
time, in any place, in any format amenable to him. ``The fact of the 
matter is that we put a very gracious and reasonable and responsible 
offer on the table and they have never responded to it after the initial 
response, which was that they would look at it,'' said Kevin McCabe, 
Vallone's campaign manager. Vallone's campaign said that including 
the WNBC invitation, Vallone had received 13 invitations to debate 
from television stations and other organizations across the state. 
Those invitations have gone to the governor as well. The Rev. Al Sharpton 
also said Sunday that he would arrange an hourlong radio forum for 
the candidates to debate issues affecting black New Yorkers. Neither 
B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, nor Lt. Gov. 
Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Liberal Party candidate, has been invited 
to join most of the debates, including the one on WNBC-TV.
