An official of Gabon's main opposition party, the Assembly of Lumberjacks, 
was kidnapped in the capital overnight by men claiming to be security 
agents, a private radio station reported Sunday. Gen. Simon Letomatome, 
political adviser to the party was seized late Friday night at his 
home in the working class suburb of Cocotier, the party was cited 
as saying in a statement to Libreville-based Africa No. 1 Radio. The 
party, which is led by a Roman Catholic Priest, Rev. Paul Mba Abessole, 
accuses President Omar Bongo's government of corruption and mismanagement. 
Bongo, who has ruled this oil-rich central African country for more 
than three decades, agreed to legalize political opposition parties 
only after fierce pro-democracy protests in the early 1990s. Bongo 
won 1993 elections with a 51 percent majority over the second-place 
Assembly of Lumberjacks. Elections are planned again for December.
