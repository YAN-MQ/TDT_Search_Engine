Noel Carroll, a hulking half-miler who set Irish, European and world 
records and helped establish Villanova as a showcase for a generation 
of Irish track stars, died in Dublin, Ireland, on Friday as he had 
so conspicuously lived _ on his feet, apparently after suffering a 
heart attack during his regular noontime run. He was 56 and was one 
of Ireland's leading exponents of clean living and physical fitness. 
If his death inevitably recalls that of Jim Fixx, the American running 
guru who was 52 when he suffered a fatal heart attack while running 
in 1984, Carroll was known in Ireland as more than a celebrated athlete 
who neither smoked nor drank and who preached the joys and benefits 
of running. Since his competitive career ended in the 1970s, he had 
spent 24 high-profile years in a continuing public dialogue with aggrieved 
citizens and municipal critics as the official spokesman of the so-called 
Dublin Corp., the city's chief operating authority. Since 1996 he 
had held the equally high-profile position of chief executive of the 
Dublin Chamber of Commerce. For all that, sports fans in the United 
States can be forgiven if they recall Carroll chiefly as the oversized 
Irish speedster who caught the eye of Villanova's legendary track 
coach, James Elliott, at the 1962 Millrose Games in New York and went 
on to turn an Irish trickle started by Ron Delaney into a tide as 
a pioneer of the famous Irish-Villanova pipeline, which drew a torrent 
of star Irish runners like Eamonn Coghlan and Marcus O'Sullivan to 
suburban Philadelphia. As a 20-year-old half-miler, Carroll, a member 
of the Irish two-mile relay team, wasn't much to look at, or was rather 
too much. At 6 foot 3 inches and 196 pounds, he was built more like 
a tight end, or maybe two half-milers, than a middle-distance runner, 
but Elliott, a former quarter-miler, wasn't called Jumbo for nothing. 
Besides, at 18 and 19, Carroll had set world age-group records in 
the 880-yard run, and when the coach saw how well he moved his bulk 
around the banked Madison Square Garden track, he offered him a scholarship. 
For Carroll, who had dropped out of school at 13 and held a series 
of jobs before beginning his running career in the army, where he 
was converted from cross-country to the 880 and 440, the chance to 
get a college education without having gone to high school was too 
good an opportunity to pass up. At Villanova he did not disappoint, 
maintaining reasonable grades while leading the Wildcats to a series 
of track championships and helping to set a world record along the 
way, in 1964, as the anchor of the 4-by-880 relay team. Although he 
turned in disappointing performances and failed to win a medal in 
two Olympic Games, 1964 and 1968, Carroll was a dominant runner of 
his time. He set an indoor European record in the 880 in 1964, won 
three consecutive European and British titles in the event, won a 
total of 14 Irish championships and set a progression of national 
records in the 880 and the 440. For all that, he maintained such a 
sense of humor about his career that he once dismissed athletics as 
``a way of proving you're better than someone else at something that's 
of no use to anybody.'' It was a sense of humor that came in handy 
during his later career as designated apologist for Dublin's municipal 
government. As Dublin Corp.'s first official spokesman, Carroll relished 
his role of defending government decisions that inevitably stepped 
on someone's toes. If it was sometimes a thankless task, Carroll maintained 
his credibility in part by bluntly speaking his mind, sometimes to 
the point of insensitivity. When a 1986 hurricane, for example, flooded 
some low-lying homes, Carroll, feeling that the wails of the afflicted 
had risen above the water line, was not as sympathetic as he could 
have been. ``People who live by the river,'' he said, ``should expect 
to get their feet wet now and again.'' Throughout his public career, 
Carroll maintained his athletic visibility by writing extensively 
about running and physical fitness, and by serving as mentor and even 
coach to young runners. In time he grew a bit sheepish about his role 
in steering native talent out of the country, and for the last several 
years he had sought to stem the flow by coaching the track team at 
University College in Dublin. Carroll, who is survived by his wife, 
Deirdre O'Callaghan, a singer and harpist, and by four children and 
five grandchildren, maintained his high spirits to the end. The night 
before his death he was in his element, mingling with 1,000 guests 
at the Chamber of Commerce's annual dinner.
