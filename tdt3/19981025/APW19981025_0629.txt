King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain will attend a ceremony here 
Monday to mark peace between Peru and Ecuador after 57 years of hostilities, 
officials said Sunday. Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and his 
Ecuadorean counterpart, Jamil Mahuad, will sign a treaty that sets 
the border between their countries, said officials. Peru and Ecuador 
fought in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over the 48-mile (78 kilometer) strip 
of jungle. Some 600 people died in fighting. The treaty was brokered 
by the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Chile. The terms reaffirm 
the boundary set in the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol, ending Ecuador's 
hopes of redrawing the border. But the Ecuadoreans will get to keep 
one square kilometer (0.4 sq. miles) of border land in the Tiwinza 
military outpost that both nations claim. Along with 600 guests, President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Argentina's Carlos Menem and 
Chile's Eduardo Frei are expected at the ceremony. U.S. special envoy 
Luigi Einaudi and Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty, a former aide to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, are also due to attend.
