The search intensified today for a sniper that killed Dr. slepian. 
A car seen leaving the area has been the only lead. More from Rehema 
Ellis. Today, at the suburban Buffalo office where Dr. Barnett slepian 
worked, people left Flowers in his memory. His closest friends and 
family are in a state of shock. He was a man of principal. He was 
going to make sure that his patients' rights were protected and wasn't 
going to bow to the bullies and the terrorists. Investigators are 
trying to determine whether Dr. slepian is the first fatality in a 
series of attacks over the last four years against doctors who perform 
abortions in western New York and Canada. In each case, the shooting 
occurred at the doctors' home -- Vancouver, november 1994, a doctor 
is hit in the leg. Hamilton, Ontario, 1995, a doctor is shot in the 
arm. Winnipeg, November 1997, a doctor is shot in the shoulder. And 
a month before that, about 80 miles from here, in Rochester, New York, 
a doctor was injured by flying debris from a gunshot that missed. 
This Canadian doctor, who did not want to be identified spoke about 
his fears earlier this month. I worry at times about my family. I 
don't want to be shot. But I would feel dreadful if it was someone 
else in my family that was shot by mistake. In Buffalo, at the clinic 
where Dr. slepian worked, they are now putting up a six-foot fence 
ordered weeks ago, but not as a rush job. At a candlelight vigil last 
night, sadness and tears for a doctor who stood for a woman's right 
to choose. Buffalo's Bishop said this today -- We are all appalled 
by this act, that is a barbarous act, which is a Heinous act. And 
tonight, the search for his killer continues. Rehema Ellis, NBC news, 
Amherst, New York.
