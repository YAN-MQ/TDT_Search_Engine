NAto today pressed Yugoslavia's President to speed up troop withdrawals 
from Kosovo or risk possible air strikes starting Tuesday. But as 
NBC's donatella lorch reports, the scene on the ground is all too 
familiar. The killing hasn't stopped. This 11-year-old ethnic Albanian 
boy was cutting wood when he was shot allegedly by Serb police. The 
violence is continuing despite Tuesday's NATO deadline for Yugoslav 
President Milosevic to implement a cease-fire and withdraw more troops 
from kosovo. We are looking at this hour by hour, he has to withdraw 
more of the military and special police. In marathon meetings today, 
NATO supreme commander general Wesley clark pressed Milosevic to accelerate 
the military withdrawal. NATO has said it will bomb if Milosevic does 
not comply. But NAto's dilemma is maintaining a threat it is reluctant 
to carry out. Western governments are quite keen to make threats of 
military force, but more often they are not willing to back them up 
with that actual force. Milosevic says he is complying. Yesterday, 
a long convoy of Serb tanks and police vehicles drove out of northern 
Kosovo towards the capital Pristina. But diplomatic observers found 
Serb security forces and guerrillas of the kosovo liberation army 
reinforcing areas in central Kosovo. The continued Serb presence in 
Kosovo is preventing 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from returning 
home, with just a few fearful of winter trickling back to their villages. 
But even at home there is little security. Today gunfire delayed the 
funeral of that 11-year-old boy. Yet more proof that there is no peace.
