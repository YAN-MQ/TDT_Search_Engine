A British teen-ager has been killed in what police suspect is a hit-and-run 
accident, the Gulf Daily News reported. Gregor Lowe, 17, was found 
dead early Friday near the town of Budaiya, some 10 kilometers (6.2 
miles) southwest of the capital Manama, with broken knees and a head 
injury, the English-language newspaper said. British Embassy spokeswoman 
Caroline Alcock said that the embassy had been notified of Lowe's 
death and that an autopsy was to be carried out. The newspaper did 
not say where Lowe was from in Britain, and the embassy also did not 
have that information. There are about 5,500 Briton living and working 
in Bahrain.
