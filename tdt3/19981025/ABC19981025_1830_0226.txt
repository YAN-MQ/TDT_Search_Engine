Netanyahu again today called for the release of convicted spy Jonathan 
pollard. President Clinton has agreed to review the question of pollard's 
release but has made no commitments. Today, the former U.S. prosecutor 
who put pollard in jail insisted again that he should stay there. 
This would be the first time we have ever given up an American who 
betrayed his country. It should never be done. It will be a precedent 
that will live in the memory of the military intelligence and foreign 
policy establishment of this country. They will never live it down 
and encourage espionage on behalf of allies. Pollard is serving a 
life sentence in federal prison in North Carolina.
