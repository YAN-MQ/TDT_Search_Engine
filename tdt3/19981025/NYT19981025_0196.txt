To mix and match 20th-century ballet classics with newer works is 
always a risk, but the San Francisco Ballet met the challenge at the 
start of the weekend. The contemporary choreography included a gem, 
while the company's touchstone neo-classicism was displayed in two 
masterpieces: ``Agon'' (1957) by George Balanchine and ``The Cage'' 
(1951) by Jerome Robbins. Both works confirmed that the company has 
a new star in Lucia Lacarra, a 22-year-old dancer from Spain whose 
impeccable classical schooling does not detract from her dramatic 
intensity. The Robbins and Balanchine ballets were strikingly danced 
at City Center, but so were the season's first performances of ``Valses 
Poeticos,'' a jewel of a romantic duet by Helgi Tomasson, the San 
Francisco Ballet's artistic director. On Friday night, Joanna Berman, 
a homegrown product of the company, demonstrated easily that her early 
potential has been fulfilled. A brilliant classical stylist, she brought 
her vitality and precision to the choreography's expressive shapes. 
Her cavalier was Cyril Pierre, a new French recruit whose masculine 
presence and excellent partnering also set off a beautiful performance 
by Sabina Allemann, who brought an ecstatic, mature tone to the woman's 
role on Saturday afternoon. As the epitome of the Balanchine-Stravinsky 
``leotard'' ballets, ``Agon'' is an outright experiment in density 
of movement and complex structure. The four men who open and close 
the work occasionally stretch into arabesque on their heels in a canon 
that parallels that of the music. But they are required to end the 
piece after the final beat, not on it. The work's pas de deux is formal, 
a startling exercise in convoluted partnering. But it can also become 
a close-up of male-female relationships. On Friday, Muriel Maffre 
and Benjamin Pierce were more compelling than at Tuesday's gala, where 
they performed the duet as an excerpt. The mechanics of the choreography 
were less evident, replaced by Miss Maffre's cool serenity and the 
naturalness with which she used her high leg extensions to describe 
Balanchine's flattened and angular shapes. Pierce admirably negotiated 
the tricky partnering with the same sense of security. Ms. Maffre 
exudes a statuesque glamour in the role, and she and Pierce excitingly 
carved their way through space. Ms. Lacarra and Stephen Legate were 
sharper on Saturday. Their dancing was smaller in scale but Legate 
has an imposing intensity, and Ms. Lacarra is like a string that ties 
and unties itself into the loops of Balanchine's choreography, so 
flexible are her own high leg extensions and the flow of her sensuous 
style. On Friday, the colloquial accents of the man's solo in the 
first trio were captured by Christopher Stowell; and on Saturday, 
Guennadi Nedviguine needed only to look less stern. Katita Waldo had 
class in the castanet solo. Parrish Maynard (who has been outstanding 
all season) and Damian Smith made evident the epigrammatic wit of 
the male duet on Friday. On the same program, Ms. Lacarra repeated 
her wiry and electrifying portrayal as the man-eating Novice in the 
insect world of ``The Cage.'' Small and highly supple, she adds a 
new resiliency to the choreography; Sara Sessions was the new and 
aptly aggressive Queen. Like Robbins, Tomasson extends the art of 
partnering in ``Valses Poeticos,'' set to several piano waltzes by 
Granados, played beautifully onstage by Michael McGraw. Ms. Berman, 
sharp and articulate, can surprise with the suddenness of a swoon, 
leg extended, in her partner's embrace. Ms. Allemann will give you 
the more soulful version. There is not a wrong note in Tomasson's 
choreography. Ivonice Satie's ``Shogun'' still looks like a sketch 
but it was more interesting than before. David Palmer and Stowell, 
in a cast change, gave the competing samurai onstage extra power and 
speed on Saturday. Tomasson's new ``Criss-Cross'' on Friday had Ms. 
Waldo, in a local debut, and Maynard leading the shimmering first 
section; Yuan Yuan Tan and Vadim Solomakha smoothly led the less striking 
second half.
