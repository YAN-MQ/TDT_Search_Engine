I'm Anthony Keith James, and this is "Headline Sports." Week eight 
of the NFL gets under way today with a battle between the patriots 
and dolphins. Both come in at 4-2 and are looking for the top spot 
in the AFC east. Our crowd really gets into it when we're on defense. 
You know, it's third down and four or third and five, you know, the 
crowd is really at a peak as far as the noise level. And I think it 
helps the defense. You have a chance to play for the lead in the AFC 
east and a team that's, you know, beat us three times last year. So, 
you know, this is what you work for and this is what you, you know, 
work so hard for all year.
