Women may have a very active role in the Catholic church. But the 
Pope says they still can't enter the priesthood. Gayle young has the 
story. It's Sunday mass in a small Catholic church in the Italian 
countryside. And, as usual, the women far outnumber the men. Some 
are so devout, they can silently recite the age-old ritual along with 
their Parish priest. They know the words. They know the routine. But 
women can never cross Altar and become priests themselves. This summer, 
Pope John Paul II reiterated a decree barring women from the priesthood. 
Under Roman Catholic laws, his decision is final and forever. For 
some Catholic feminists, the decree is a blow to women's equality 
in the church. They cannot accept women as people who make responsible, 
moral decisions. This creates a point of friction within the Catholic 
community. While the church seems a bastion of inequality to some, 
women certainly are not leaving in a huff. Instead, they seem to comprise 
the bulk of practicing Catholics. Women crowd to see the Pope, usually 
outnumbering men in the audience. And there are twice as many nuns 
as priests, suggesting more women are devout. It's a bit of an anomaly 
-- men running an institution comprised of large numbers of women. 
The subject is so sensitive that Vatican officials refused requests 
to speak about it on camera. But privately, they say priests represent 
Jesus Christ, and therefore must be male. The officials also say women 
are attracted to the church because it supports their right to work. 
And it promotes equality in marriage, while some other religions encourage 
wives to submit to their husbands. There were no protests in Rome 
to counter the Pope's latest decree on women priests. Catholic women 
seem to either accept the ruling or accept this Pope will never change. 
So while the princes of the church rule the Vatican, it's debatable 
whether women remain on the front lines or the sidelines of catholicism.
