Louisiana state police now say six workers were killed after a natural 
gas well exploded and caught fire about 45 miles east of Shreveport. 
Four others were injured in yesterday's blast. A police spokesman 
says the Derrick started to melt in the intense heat. The fire continues 
to burn out of control and its cause won't be investigated until the 
flames have been extinguished.
