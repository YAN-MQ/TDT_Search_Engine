In crucial steps in the evolution of one of the largest and more unusual 
talent agencies in Hollywood, International Creative Management Inc. 
has announced the naming of new co-presidents and the adoption of 
a more forward-looking strategy after a decade of focusing on debt 
reduction. The company said Friday that Nancy Josephson, who runs 
its television business, and Ed Limato, who heads the motion picture 
business, will become co-presidents. In a reflection of the creativity 
suggested by the firm's name, the former president, Jim Wiatt, will 
take on the new titles of co-chairman and co-chief executive, but 
he will hold those positions alone. Jeffrey Berg will retain his longstanding 
titles of chairman and chief executive. ICM, as it is known, is not 
only one of the most influential talent agencies, but also the only 
agency to have once been part of a public company and then to have 
gone through a leveraged buyout _ something quite unusual for a service 
business with few tangible assets. A decade ago, the agency was part 
of Josephson International, a publicly traded diversified media and 
financial concern. The company had been founded by Marvin Josephson, 
the father of Ms. Josephson, the new co-president. ICM split off from 
the other companies and went through a $70 million buyout in 1988, 
in which the management put up about $10 million of the purchase price 
and borrowed the rest. Berg said ICM had now paid off most of the 
debt and was making the management changes as it turned its focus 
toward new opportunities. ``The fundamental dynamic at the firm is 
shifting from the debt model to the equity model,'' he said. ``We're 
broadening the management base so we can think about new markets, 
online businesses, telecommunications opportunities. We now have the 
ability to grow in a different way.'' ICM will remain a private corporation. 
Limato is a well-known agent, representing actors like Mel Gibson, 
Michelle Pfeiffer and Denzel Washington. Invitations to his annual 
Oscar parties are among the most sought-after in Hollywood. Ms. Josephson 
now becomes one of the highest-ranking women in the agency world. 
Among her better-known clients are Marta Kaufman, David Crane and 
Kevin Bright, the creators of ``Friends'' and ``Veronica's Closet.''
