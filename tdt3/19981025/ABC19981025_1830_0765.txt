And then, in Minnesota, there's Jesse "the body" Ventura. Once one 
of the meanest villains on the pro wrestling circuit, now he's running 
for governor. Here's ABC's Mark Mullen. Jesse. Jesse. Who would have 
guessed that 47-year-old entertainer/politician jesse Ventura -- How 
are you doin'? a reform party candidate, a political underdog with 
the least amount of campaign money, a former professional wrestler, 
talk show host and actor -- I ain't got time to bleed. -- and former 
mayor of a Minneapolis suburb could shake up the minnesota governor's 
race so much? But he has. That's right, kids. We can beat those guys. 
Ventura was considered little more than a novelty, getting only 10% 
of voter support in the polls. But recently, his popularity more than 
doubled in this three-man race, meaning that Jesse Ventura is a legitimate 
contender. Ventura's surge in popularity has affected this man, four-term 
state attorney general Hubert Humphrey III. The democrat had been 
the clear front-runner. But now, because of Ventura, Humphrey is running 
virtually even with the republican challenger, St. Paul mayor Norm 
Coleman. Coleman concedes Ventura is doing well because some voters 
are fed up with traditional politicians. People are fed up with the 
same old thing being rehashed day after day. But many voters here 
like Ventura's Blunt style. You know, a lot of these candidates tell 
you that your vote is wasted if you vote for Jesse Ventura. That is 
pompous and arrogant. And they like his mix of populist views. He 
supports the death penalty but is pro-choice. He is against gun control 
but supports medical use of marijuana. People are hearing in my message 
that I'm one of them. Critics think on election day, voters will choose 
a traditional candidate, but Ventura takes this race seriously and 
intends to win. Even if he doesn't, he has shown that someone who's 
not a career politician can impact the system. Mark Mullen, ABC News, 
Minneapolis.
