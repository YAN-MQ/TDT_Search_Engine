Lifting her 4-year-old son from the seat of a blue Honda moped, Federica 
Frontani, 33, tenderly kissed him and warned him to play carefully 
at preschool. Asked why she risked driving her child by moped through 
Rome's notoriously speedy and chaotic traffic, Mrs. Frontani said 
that the distance was too long to walk and that the streets were too 
clogged for cars. Asked why neither she nor he wore a helmet, she 
replied, ``They do not make helmets small enough for children.'' Why 
not? ``Well, actually it is illegal to put children on mopeds,'' she 
said with a sheepish smile. ``But in this city, what else can you 
do?'' Italians, and particularly Romans, are addicted to motorbikes. 
As cars frozen in mile-long traffic jams honk angrily, Vespas, Hondas 
and Piaggios career forward, scattering pedestrians like pigeons in 
St. Peter's Square. Mopeds dart around buses, speed through red lights 
and zoom the wrong way on one-way streets, buzzing the Colosseum like 
Audrey Hepburn in ``Roman Holiday.'' Everybody drives them. Teen-agers 
and businessmen alike smoke and talk on cell phones as they drive. 
Mothers sometimes pile on two children, one in front and one clinging 
behind. Until he was elected in 1993, the mayor of Rome, Francesco 
Rutelli, proudly drove his Honda SF Fifty moped around the capital. 
His security detail dissuaded him from driving it to City Hall _ but 
they were worried about terrorist attacks, not traffic accidents. 
Law enforcement officials and government agencies battling to bring 
safety standards up to a European par find themselves fighting some 
of Italy's most entrenched cultural traits. ``Unfortunately, we are 
a nation of scofflaws,'' said Giuseppe Cesaro, spokesman for the Automobile 
Club of Italy. Cesaro said many of the mothers who fearlessly ferry 
their bareheaded toddlers on mopeds are the same who, at the beach, 
run screaming into the water to pluck out children who try to go swimming 
less than an hour after their lunch. ``If you wanted to list all the 
contradictions of Italy,'' he said wearily, ``it would fill an encyclopedia.'' 
Yet the consequences are lethal. Between 1989 and 1995, European countries 
on average brought down the mortality rates from traffic accidents 
by 14 percent. In Italy, however, deaths rose by 2 percent, according 
to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Commission. Safety 
laws and even common-sense precautions are routinely ignored. According 
to Sicurstrada, a traffic safety research center in Bologna, only 
about 36 percent of moped drivers in Italy wear helmets, which are 
not mandatory for drivers over 18. ``Of course, the numbers change 
drastically from North to South,'' said Sandro Vedovi, national coordinator 
of Sicurstrada. ``I've been told that in southern Italy, police stop 
you if you are wearing a helmet _ because they suspect you are about 
to commit a crime.'' The government hopes that if and when amendments 
are made to the traffic code that will require all drivers of mopeds 
to wear helmets, people will start complying. Many Italians are skeptical. 
Despite a 1988 law requiring seat belts, only 10 percent of Italians 
buckle up, compared with 92 percent of Germans and 68 percent of Americans, 
according to a 1997 study conducted by the University of Birmingham, 
in England. All cars in Italy are required to provide seat belts in 
front and in back, but that has not prompted Italians to fasten them. 
``I promised my men that if they ever found one Italian who buckled 
his back seat belt, I'd buy him the best fish dinner in Rimini,'' 
said Chief Inspector Giordano Biserni, president of the Association 
of Supporters and Friends of the Traffic Police. ``So far, not one 
has succeeded.'' Italy has passed laws requiring all motorcycle drivers 
to wear helmets. Children under 18 are also required to wear helmets 
on mopeds. Italian law also prohibits children or even adults from 
being passengers on mopeds. But on any street in Rome, and particularly 
in Naples, it is obvious that there are more toddlers and adult passengers 
on mopeds than there are helmets on drivers. ``We need more public 
awareness,'' Biserni said. ``And we need tighter enforcement. We have 
to give tickets without hesitation.'' He sighed. ``The Italian traffic 
police are too nice, particularly to women.'' Recently, there have 
been attempts to increase both public awareness and police ruthlessness. 
It is no longer uncommon to see police road traps on major streets 
of Rome, where groups of police officers, finding severity in numbers, 
flag down offenders and ignore their pleas for mercy. Last year the 
Ministry of Public Works began Italy's biggest public awareness campaign 
with television and radio ads and billboards that for the first time 
pressed helmet use. The ads showed a caption that read: ``What helmet? 
I never fall.'' It was placed above a white chalk police outline of 
a corpse. But experts say such campaigns have so far not yielded much 
change. Some parents are beginning to pay heed. Too often, it comes 
too late. One of the most noticed helmet campaigns was the one mounted 
by the parents of Andrea Bordignon, an 18-year-old high school senior 
in Treviso who was killed this summer on his motorcycle. A collision 
caused him to hit his unprotected head on cement. Before his funeral 
and on the day of his funeral, his family and friends posted signs 
all over town with a picture of a helmet. Underneath, the caption 
read: ``I forgot to put on my helmet. And now it is too late to do 
it. Let my memory be a warning to you.''
