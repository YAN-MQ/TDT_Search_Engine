Walter Kendrick, a professor of English at Fordham University who 
was an authority on Victorian literature, an author and a literary 
critic, died Monday in Beth Israel Hospice in Manhattan. He was 51 
and lived in Manhattan's West Village. The cause was pancreatic cancer, 
said his companion, Daniel Applebaum. Kendrick taught until early 
in this fall semester at Fordham, whose faculty he had joined as an 
assistant professor in 1975. The New York Times book critic Michiko 
Kakutani wrote in a review of Kendrick's book ``The Thrill of Fear: 
250 Years of Scary Entertainment'' (1991, Grove): ``In this lively 
new study of scary entertainment, the scholar Walter Kendrick _ the 
author of a diverting study of pornography called `The Secret Museum' 
_ takes issue with `those who bemoan the graphic bloodletting of late-century 
horror films, who see it as a symptom of terminal degeneracy in Western 
culture.' There is nothing particularly new about today's horror films, 
he writes, except innovations made possible by special-effects technology.'' 
Ms. Kakutani called ``The Thrill of Fear'' ``informative and consistently 
entertaining,'' and critic John Gross wrote, also in a review in The 
Times, that ``The Secret Museum: Pornography in Modern Culture'' (1987, 
California) had ``a great deal to recommend it.'' Kendrick's other 
writings included ``The Novel-Machine: The Theory and Fiction of Anthony 
Trollope'' (1980, Books on Demand). He contributed essays and reviews 
about literature and art to The Village Voice, The Oxford Review, 
Salmagundi and The Boston Globe. He also wrote book reviews for The 
Times and almost 100 articles in various journals. At his death he 
was working on a book-length chronicle of two old Rhode Island families, 
the Kendricks and the Mayforths (his mother was a Mayforth). He was 
chairman of the literary criticism section of the Northeast Modern 
Language Association in 1981 and a fellow of the National Endowment 
for the Humanities in 1980 and 1981. Professor Kendrick was born in 
Providence, R.I., and received a bachelor's degree in 1968 from Wesleyan 
University and a doctorate in 1975 from Yale University. He was in 
the Army, stationed mainly in Germany, from 1968 to 1971. He is survived 
by his companion, Applebaum.
