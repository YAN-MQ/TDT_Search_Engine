Louisiana state police now say seven people are dead because of a 
natural gas explosion, about 45 miles east of Shreveport. Authorities 
say 13 workers were finishing up a new gas well when it burst into 
flames yesterday. The cause of the blast isn't known. Witnesses say 
flames shot 100 feet into the air. I was in a stand about 500 yards 
from the explosion. It sounded like three, high-powered rifle shots, 
then a shotgun, then a Stick of dynamite, and by the time the fourth 
one went off and had turned and looked and flames shot up in the air 
400 or 500 feet. Authorities say at least four workers also were injured.
