Their play outfits and their faces scrubbed, they bounded out of their 
caseworkers' cars at the North Ward Cultural Center here, which was 
decked out on this late-summer Saturday with a big striped tent worthy 
of a wedding. Twenty-one children, 4 to 12, were reporting for a party 
_ hamburgers and hot dogs, sack races and musical chairs, bags of 
goodies to be collected. Mostly, though, they were here to be seen. 
This party was what the New Jersey Department of Human Services calls 
a ``match event,'' and the honored guests were seven adults who had 
completed orientation sessions for adoption. While couples around 
the nation, in their classified ads and ``dear birth mother'' letters, 
plead for a baby to love, the state of New Jersey pleads for families 
to love these children: 8-year-old Saraelle, looking quizzical as 
she peered at grown-ups through coke-bottle glasses; Nije, also 8, 
smile blazing, busily tugging his caseworker around; the brothers 
Milo and Omar, 12 and 10, sticking together all day, Omar in a royal 
blue t-shirt and Milo in a red one that announced, ``The children 
are our future.'' They were among about 100 children in foster care 
or group homes who have no immediate prospects for families. The Division 
of Youth and Family Services is campaigning on their behalf, with 
a $600,000 recruitment budget that the state provided last year and 
renewed this summer: It has ads on buses and billboards, in public 
service announcements and on flyers to be mailed with motor-vehicle 
renewal forms. The children's pictures and profiles are published 
in a glossy book (call 1-800-99-ADOPT). These are also on a web site 
(http://206.228.220.32/njadopt_static/), which will soon have audio 
and video clips. The department places about 700 children a year in 
permanent homes, 85 percent to 90 percent of them ``special needs'' 
children whose care continues to be subsidized: adoptive families 
are given the same monthly stipend that foster parents receive until 
the child is 18. Still, there are never enough parents. Donna Younkin, 
the administrator of the adoption office, said New Jersey's state's 
foster care population had grown 56 percent since 1994; ``we're closing 
in on 3,000 kids,'' she said. Once adoptive parents are interested 
and qualified, Ms. Younkin said, the social events are among the happier 
methods of promoting matches. ``People get queasy about it and say, 
isn't this terrible and awkward? But the kids have a nice day out.'' 
At the Newark party, the hovering social workers acknowledged the 
hopes and fears in play here. ``They know why they're here,'' said 
Zavier Mauldin. Some of them, he said, ``have been through this over 
and over.'' The prospective parents were nervous themselves, with 
the possible exception of Kendra Orta, a day-care worker, and her 
husband, Orlando, who quickly fell in with bunches of kids. ``I'm 
22 and my husband is 25,'' Mrs. Orta said. ``We want a family. We 
decided to go this route first.'' The Ortas just moved to a two-bedroom 
apartment and outfitted the bigger bedroom for their first two children. 
``We have one picked out, and we came here to get another one,'' said 
Orta, a security guard who has already advised his boss that the four-year-old 
boy they hope to bring home soon will be spending time with him at 
work. Luce Ramirez, 48, who lives near the Ortas in East Orange, was 
making plans for a daughter: ``I've got the school picked out, Our 
Lady of Mount Carmel -- good Catholic discipline. Is this obsessive? 
I already know what pediatrician to go to. I got the name of a pediatric 
dentist.'' ``I'm nervous,'' she added. ``I'm trying really hard not 
to let my hopes get too high. What if I fall in love with this child, 
and this child doesn't want any part of me?'' she mused, referring 
to the face-to-face meetings that follow in the match-making. Many 
of the children, they understand, need a lot of healing. It's a point 
made in the children's biographies: ``Behaviors which Taiesha struggles 
with are enuresis, hiding food and acting out as a result of past 
abuse,'' one says. The description of Naim, a ``mannerly and very 
likable'' 13-year old, notes that other children ``have teased and 
ridiculed him, taken advantage of him and even physically attacked 
him because of his thick glasses, poor motor skills and low academic 
performance.'' But this party was short on burdens. After the sack 
races and lunch warm-up, the cupcake decorating and water-balloon 
lobbing, it reached a crescendo with a boisterous musical chairs scramble 
to the boom-box accompaniment of Kirk Franklin's ``Stomp.'' As they 
left, the adults filled out forms on which they could name one or 
two children they wanted to know more about, and perhaps to meet again. 
Altogether, the seven chose 10 children.
