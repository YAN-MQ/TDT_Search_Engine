India is not working on a secret deal with the United States as part 
of talks aimed at getting New Delhi to sign the nuclear test ban treaty, 
Defense Minister George Fernandes said Sunday. ``There cannot be any 
kind of private deal between the United States and India on signing 
or not signing. It is a national issue,'' Fernandes was quoted as 
saying in a panel discussion to be telecast Monday on the state-run 
Doordarshan television network. ``I believe that until Parliament 
clears it there is no question of signing it,'' Fernandes was quoted 
as saying. A transcript of his remarks on the weekly program ``On 
the Record,'' was made available to news agencies Sunday. In a speech 
last month at the United Nations, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 
expressed optimism that talks with the United States would conclude 
successfully and enable New Delhi to sign the nuclear test ban treaty 
by September 1999. Vajpayee said on his return that some doubts remained 
about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but New Delhi had accepted 
the substance of the agreement by announcing a unilateral moratorium 
on nuclear testing. Sunday, Fernandes watered down the prime minister's 
statement. ``I would consider that as a statement of intent. Nothing 
more,'' he was quoted as saying in the discussion. U.S. Deputy Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott has held a series of discussions with Indian 
negotiator Jaswant Singh on the treaty after New Delhi carried out 
five underground nuclear tests in May. India's neighbor and rival 
Pakistan responded to those test with its own tests. Washington imposed 
economic sanctions against both nations. The United States wants India 
and Pakistan to sign the treaty and to take steps toward reconciliation 
to end their bitter 50-year rivalry. The treaty must be signed and 
ratified by 44 countries with nuclear powers before it can go into 
effect. Forty-one of those 44 states have signed: India, Pakistan 
and North Korea have not. Of those 41 signatories, 10 have ratified 
the treaty: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, 
Peru, Slovakia, and Britain. Fernandes said there had been little 
progress during the talks with Washington.
