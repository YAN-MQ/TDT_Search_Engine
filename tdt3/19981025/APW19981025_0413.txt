Hermann Maier led an Austrian sweep of the podium Sunday in the men's 
World Cup opening giant slalom. The double Olympic champion produced 
two stunning runs to finish first with a two-leg aggregate time of 
2 minutes, 10.74 seconds. Teammate Stefan Eberharter, the Olympic 
silver medallist, crossed second in 2:12.34, while Heinz Schilchegger 
was third in 2:13.08. The three had clocked the fastest times in the 
first leg to set up an Austrian sweep with compatriot Josef Strobl 
sitting in fourth as an insurance marker. But it was countryman Christian 
Mayer who placed fourth after the second leg with a total time of 
2:13.13, with Strobl dropping to 19th after a disasterous final run. 
Two-time World Cup champion Michael Von Gruenigen, sixth after the 
first run, moved up a spot to fifth after the second, with a time 
of 2:13.28. Germany's Markus Eberle, who had just eeked into the top 
30 to qualify after the first leg, had the second fastest time, holding 
the lead until Austrian Hans Knauss posted an identical chrono. In 
the end Eberle moved up to a spectacular sixth place with a combined 
time of 2:13.35. Strong winds and heavy snow had forced race officials 
to delay the start of the race by more than two hours, while workers 
cleared the course and re-erected the start hut, which had been blown 
down overnight.
