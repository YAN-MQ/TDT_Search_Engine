India and Bangladesh will discuss their common border problems when 
their officials meet at a four-day conference here next week, officials 
said Sunday. An 11-member Indian delegation led by E.N. Ram Mohan, 
Director General of the Border Security Force, flew in Sunday for 
the talks which begin Monday. Mohan will have discussions with Major 
General Azizur Rahman, head of the Bangladeshi border guards. Dhaka 
will raise the question of the alleged migration of several thousand 
Indian tribespeople into the hilly regions of Bangladesh following 
the signing of a peace accord between the Bangladeshi government and 
Buddhist rebels last December, official sources said. According to 
officials estimates, some 20,000 Indian nationals of the Chakma tribe 
have crossed into Bangladesh along with Bangladeshi tribespeople who 
had taken refuge in India for years and returned to their country 
after the accord. But Shantu Larma, the leader of the tribespeople, 
has rejected the government claim of large-scale migration of Indian 
Chakmas. The two sides will also discuss the cross-border trafficking 
of women and children, smuggling, illegal trespassing and the frequent 
exchanges of gunfire between border guards on both sides, officials 
said.
