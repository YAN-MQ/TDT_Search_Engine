Two days after a joyous reunion with family members he had left behind 
in Cuba, Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez sat with them in the front 
row at St. Patrick's Cathedral Sunday listening as Cardinal John O'Connor 
praised Cuban President Fidel Castro for making it all possible. ``We 
are grateful to President Castro,'' said O'Connor, who had contacted 
Castro on Hernandez's behalf to ask him to grant the family permission 
to visit. The cardinal went on to thank Attorney General Janet Reno, 
FBI Director Louis Freeh and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner for 
bringing the family together. Hernandez was reunited with his daughters, 
his mother, Maria Julia Pedroso Cruz, and his former wife, Norma Alvira 
Manso, on Friday after being separated from them since last December, 
when he fled Cuba in a boat to pursue a professional baseball career. 
He ended up playing an integral role in the Yankees' winning the World 
Series. O'Connor said that Sunday's Mass was not specifically said 
in honor of Hernandez, who is known as El Duque. ``This Mass is in 
honor of God,'' the cardinal said. ``Give thanks to him for having 
El Duque and his family here.'' Hernandez and his family members were 
greeted with applause when they were introduced at the church, then 
they joined O'Connor for brunch in his residence after the Mass. Hernandez 
did not make any public statements, but was expected to ask the cardinal 
to baptize his daughters, Yahumara, 8, and Steffi, 3.
