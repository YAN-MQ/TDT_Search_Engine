There's much more ahead on "World News Tonight Sunday." The Clinton 
factor. Big money and big problems for some of his closest allies. 
more violence in Kosovo. NAto faces growing pressure to respond. and 
how do you turn a sheltered, anti-social computer geek into a smooth 
operator. Into a smooth operator. The truck. The award. The new Chevy 
Silverado. It's bigger. it's more powerful. It's the truck. From Chevrolet. 
Like a rock. oh... like a rock.
