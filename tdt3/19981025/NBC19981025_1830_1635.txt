In Oklahoma City today, ground was broken for a memorial at the site 
of the worst act of terrorism in U.S. history occurred 3 1/2 years 
ago. NBC's Jim Cummins reports on a promise never to forget. Today, 
the surviving victims of the Oklahoma City bombing grabbed shovels 
and began breaking ground for a memorial to the 168 men, women and 
children who died in the blast. "We will never forget" -- those words 
were written on the windows of an Oklahoma City police car just after 
the bombing. Those words remain just as powerful today. "We will never 
forget." Marla hornberger scooped up piece of the ground where the 
Murrah building used to stand to help her remember. I was here the 
day the building was bombed. And I lost a lot of friends. And I just 
want something from here. I'll be glad when the memorial is built. 
It will be a national memorial, costing $24 million and run by the 
park service. Today, in the dark shadow of meaning, we gather to seek 
the light. Oklahoma City has come together once again to choose hope. 
And that is a blessing for our entire nation. Tomorrow, many of these 
same people will return here to the bomb site form a human chain and 
remove this fence that has become the unofficial memorial to those 
who perished in the bombing. Sections of the fence will be saved as 
part of the memorial park, which will include a field of 168 empty 
chairs for those who lost their lives. Including deb Farrell Lynn's 
cousin, Susan -- Lynn says she's ready for the fence to come down. 
Good things are gonna happen. It's almost just like saying good-bye 
to someone I'm very familiar with. But I will see you soon. And we'll 
be better next time we see each other. The permanent memorial is expected 
to open in March of the year 2000. Jim Cummins, NBC news, Oklahoma 
City.
