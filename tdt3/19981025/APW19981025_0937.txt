Five weeks after armed Basque separatists declared a cease-fire, their 
allied Herri Batasuna party posted gains in regional elections Sunday. 
But so did Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's party which opposes any 
split in Spain. With 99 percent of the vote counted, the moderate 
Basque Nationalist Party that helped bring about the truce finished 
first in parliamentary elections placed first with 21 of the house's 
75 seats, Basque Interior Minister Juan Maria Atutxa said. The party 
has topped the vote in each of the five previous regional elections 
although it has never won a majority. Herri Batasuna, the party linked 
to the armed group ETA which declared the cease-fire, gained three 
seats for a total of 14, he said. Aznar's Popular Party jumped from 
11 to 16 seats. The winning party will need to seek an alliance with 
others to form a new government. The party favors independence although 
it also lends support to Aznar's moderate government in the national 
Parliament in Madrid. Officials said 70.8 percent of the 1.8 million 
registered voters turned out despite chilly, rainy weather in this 
northern region. The figure was nearly 11 percentage points more than 
that of the last election in 1994. The open-ended cease-fire by ETA 
focused attention on whether the truce would propel pro-independence 
parties to electoral gains. ``The future of Euskadi is at stake,'' 
said Carlos Iturgaiz, the Popular Party candidate for Basque regional 
president, who is elected by the parliament. He was using the Basque 
word for the region. The election is the sixth since Spain granted 
the Basque country a broad degree of autonomy 19 years ago. Following 
the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spain was divided 
into 17 autonomous regions although the national government still 
controls most strategic powers, such as foreign affairs and defense. 
Aznar had hoped a a strong performance for his party and other non-nationalist 
groups more clout in dealing with nationalists to seek a settlement 
to one of Western Europe's last regional conflicts. ETA, whose name 
is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has 
killed nearly 800 people since 1968. It began its truce Sept. 18 making 
this the first regional election held without a threat of violence. 
Aznar says there can be no peace process until ETA accepts the results 
of the elections and renounces violence for good. Although ETA has 
called cease-fires before, many Spaniards see this one as the best 
opportunity in years to end the conflict.
