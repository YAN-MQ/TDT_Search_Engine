The 15 European Union leaders pledged Sunday to revive stalled EU 
reform talks and better coordinate their economic policies to weather 
global financial turmoil. ``The sense of urgency in the economic situation 
is very great indeed,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair after 
a two-day EU summit in this Alpine lakeside resort. The summit marked 
a leftward swing in EU capitals with the emergence of Gerhard Schroeder, 
a social democrat as German chancellor, and Massimo D'Alema, the new, 
former-communist Italian premier. Eleven of the 15 EU leaders are 
now left of center. The impetus to crank the EU reform drive into 
high gear came from Schroeder, whose center-left coalition takes office 
Tuesday, ending 16 years of Helmut Kohl's conservative rule. Germany 
assumes the EU presidency in January and Schroeder set a five-month 
timetable to amend the Union's founding charter so the now 15-member 
union can admit a dozen newcomers and not choke on its own red tape. 
Reforms are painful and touch on cutting farm subsidies, revamping 
EU finances and giving the union a stronger defense and foreign policy 
profile. In a turnaround widely welcomed, British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair declared his support for a greater European defense role to 
prevent a recurrence of EU ``dithering and disunity'' over Kosovo. 
``As Kosovo has brought home to us, it is right ... that we play a 
key and leading role,'' Blair said. ``Europe ... was slow to act. 
If we had a more developed common foreign and security policy it would 
be easier.'' Viktor Klima, the Austrian Chancellor and summit chairman, 
said the leaders agreed more coordination of economic policies ``is 
the key to create employment'' and growth to counter financial mayhem 
sweeping in from Asia, Russia and Latin America. The summit was held 
less than 100 days before the launch of the single European currency 
that will aim to turn Europe into a zone of stability and growth under 
an independent European Central Bank. Yet there were mutterings central 
banks in Europe must join the struggle against global financial turmoil 
by lowering benchmark interest rates since inflation is at its lowest 
levels for decades. ``The balance of the risk in the world economy 
has shifted from inflation to deflation,'' said Blair. ``Everyone 
is cognizant of this and it has policy implications.'' While leaders 
stressed they did not want to erode the independence of the ECB that 
starts running monetary policy next year, they urged the central bankers 
to help keep Europe on an even economic keel. The leaders asked their 
finance ministers to look into proposals for raising money to finance 
public works projects, such as trans-continental highway and high-speed 
rail networks. ``If there are good, sensible infrastructure projects 
that will enhance the competitiveness of European economy (they) will 
need to be looked at,'' Blair said. Schroeder told the summit it was 
important to have ``energetic efforts to coordinate economic policy.'' 
Though he stopped short of endorsing an EU-wide employment policy, 
his comments were a departure from the views of the outgoing German 
government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Schroeder said the EU governments 
must at long last accelerate fruitless talks about reforming the EU 
ahead of its enlargement into eastern Europe. New housekeeping rules 
must replace ones from the 1950s when there were only six members. 
Cyprus and a almost a dozen East European nations are in line to join 
the EU. Schroeder urged his partners to settle on draft reforms at 
a mid-December summit in Vienna. He said he may call another summit 
in February before the reforms can be finalized in March. The talks 
have so far been fruitless because of the scope of proposals: farm 
subsidy cuts of up to 30 percent, more majority voting eroding national 
sovereignty and overhauling the budget to end complaints from Germany, 
Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands they pay too much for EU membership.
