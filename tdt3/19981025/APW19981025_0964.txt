With a harsh austerity package to be unveiled this week, voters on 
Sunday elected a key ally of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in 
Brazil's most important state, the first official results showed. 
With 57 percent of the vote counted, Sao Paulo state Gov. Mario Covas 
had 56 percent of the vote, while two-time former governor Paulo Maluf 
had 44 percent. The race in Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most 
populous state, was the most closely watched of the gubernatorial 
runoff elections in 12 states and the Federal District. The support 
for Covas, a frugal administrator and friend of Cardoso, is a tremendous 
boost for the president, who is trying to rescue Brazil from the global 
financial crisis. Covas told reporters that the partial results showed 
that the electorate ``understands that you cannot spend more than 
you take in.'' He said ``difficult decisions will have to be made,'' 
and that there will be ``less money for social projects like health 
and education.'' In other important states, however, polls showed 
Cardoso's opponents were winners. In Rio de Janeiro, with 86 percent 
of the votes counted, Anthony Garotinho, a radio announcer of the 
center-left Democratic Labor Party, had 58 percent of the vote. His 
opponent, former Rio mayor Cesar Maia, a Cardoso ally, had 42 percent 
and conceded defeat. Former President Itamar Franco, who broke with 
Cardoso during the campaign, won handily in powerful Minas Gerais 
state. Official results showed that with 25 percent of the vote counted, 
Franco was leading with 58 percent.Incumbent Eduardo Azeredo, of Cardoso's 
Brazilian Social Democracy Party had 42 percent. In the southern Rio 
Grande do Sul, an important farm state, Olivio Dutra of the leftist 
Workers Party was leading with 55 percent. Incumbent Antonio Britto, 
a Cardoso backer, had 45 percent, official results showed. Results 
from states with electronic voting machines were expected by Monday, 
while returns from states that used paper ballots would take two days 
longer, electoral officials said. Brazil is a victim of the global 
financial crisis that began last year in Asia and shifted to Russia 
before moving here. In the past two months, investors have withdrawn 
some dlrs 25 billion from the country. Cardoso's economic team and 
the International Monetary Fund have spent the past weeks working 
out ways to slash Brazil's deficit of around dlrs 65 billion, or 7 
percent of the gross domestic product. Many of Cardoso's proposals 
_ which include spending cuts and tax hikes _ require congressional 
approval, and governors have tremendous influence over how legislators 
vote. They must be tough enough to persuade the IMF to approve a dlrs 
30 billion rescue package. As Brazilians awaited the unveiling of 
the package, the elections became a referendum on the austerity measures. 
``Without them, Brazil will collapse,'' said Adriano Ramos, a financial 
analyst in Sao Paulo who voted for Covas. But many voters were unwilling 
to vote for more cuts. Osvaldo Severino Correia, a Rio telecommunications 
technician, showed his paycheck of dlrs 116 (140 reals) a month. After 
taxes, he has just dlrs 95 (113 reals). ``Now they want to take out 
more taxes,'' he said. ``I wouldn't vote for the government candidates 
for anything in the world.'' Although voting is mandatory, observers 
said the turnout seemed low and voters were subdued. Cardoso, who 
was re-elected Oct. 4 by receiving more than half the vote on the 
first ballot, has given Brazilians little choice. Army troops were 
deployed in four northern states to ensure peace. In the poor northeastern 
state of Piaui, the government ordered the seizure of newspapers and 
magazines that carried stories critical of incumbent Gov. Mao Santa.
