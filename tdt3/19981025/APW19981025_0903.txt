In a major rupture within Yasser Arafat's ranks, members of the Palestinian 
leader's political faction fought Palestinian security forces with 
rocks and bullets Sunday. A 16-year old Fatah activist was killed 
in the violence. The fighting followed a move by Palestinian military 
intelligence to seize unlicensed weapons and inspect files belonging 
to Arafat's Fatah faction. A crackdown on illegal arms was among tough 
new security measures Arafat agreed to at last week's Israeli-Palestinian 
summit. The clash alarmed Palestinian leaders, who fear the pressures 
of the implementing the U.S.-brokered agreement will wind up pitting 
Palestinian against Palestinian. Many of its provisions, such as reining 
in Islamic militants, disarming political groups and halting anti-Israel 
incitement, are extremely unpopular and will be difficult politically 
for Arafat's government to impose.
