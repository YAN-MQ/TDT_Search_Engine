Hostile gunfire whistled over the heads of mourners Sunday at the 
funeral of an 11-year-old Albanian boy that international observers 
said they were unable to attend. The boy, Shemsi Elshani, was shot 
to death Saturday by Serb police while helping his father and cousin 
chop wood from the hillside behind this mountain village 30 kilometers 
(18 miles) west of Pristina, according to Shemsi's father. A team 
of European diplomats and an American team of the Kosovo Diplomatic 
Observer Mission came to the house of the grieving family Sunday morning, 
but all left before the burial. Gunfire from another hill about one 
kilometer ( 1,000 yards) away, the same area from where the fatal 
shots came the day before, sounded several times as the diplomats 
decided what to do. The Europeans left soon afterward, while the American 
observer team questioned Shemsi's father, Rashit Elshani, and called 
to its headquarters before leaving. Villagers asked team leader Norman 
Olsen to attend the funeral because they believed his presence would 
stop further shooting, but he said that wasn't true. ``Even though 
we have armored vehicles, if somebody is determined to shoot more 
people, they won't stop for us,'' Olsen said. ``Our presence at the 
gravesite will not protect you. If any diplomat tells you otherwise, 
he's wrong.'' Shemsi's death and the unwillingness of the foreign 
observers to attend his funeral showed the difficulties facing the 
international community in forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
to comply with the Oct. 12 agreement that averted NATO airstrikes 
on his forces. Meanwhile, in an interview with British Broadcasting 
Corp., British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the threat of Nato 
airstrikes would not be lifted until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
reduces forces to pre-conflict level. ``He has made progress but he 
needs to try an awful lot harder,'' he said, referring to Milosevic. 
``I think that when on Tuesday we review this, we may well come to 
the conclusion we cannot yet relax our guard, we cannot stand down 
the planes, we need further progress before we relax that order,'' 
Cook said in the interview. Despite the agreement's demands for a 
cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of extra police and military 
forces sent into Kosovo in an offensive on separatist Albanians that 
started in February, sporadic violence continues with signs of increasing 
Serb intimidation intended to prevent Albanian refugees from returning 
to some villages. Rashit Elshani said his son died simply because 
``he's Albanian.'' ``Even if you're unarmed, they're going to shoot 
you,'' he said, his only surviving son, 7-year-old Dardan, hugging 
his leg. ``We'd been there for two hours cutting trees and carrying 
them. We saw them (the police) without binoculars and they had binoculars.'' 
His wife, Hasime, also 37, fainted repeatedly beside Shemsi's bloodied 
body, which lay beneath blankets in a room of mourners. Scores of 
mourners walked up the hillside for the burial in a fresh grave next 
to six others _ including an uncle of Shemsi _ killed in a Serb offensive 
in the area on Sept. 25. As the funeral ended, gunshots sounded again 
from the far hill, with each round coming closer to the dispersing 
mourners. Some ran down the hill while others hit the dirt, hearing 
the whistle of a bullet overhead.
