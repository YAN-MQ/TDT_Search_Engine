The congress of the second largest opposition party approved late 
on Saturday the participation of ethnic Hungarians in the future coalition 
government, media reported Sunday. The Party of the Democratic Left 
has been the only one of the four opposition parties so far to oppose 
participation of the Hungarian Coalition Party in the new government. 
The Democratic Left was afraid that once in the government, the Hungarians 
might call for regional autonomy of the 550,000-strong Hungarian minority 
and other contentious issues. Support by the Hungarians in parliament 
will allow the new government to enact constitutional laws.
