Three members of the Islamic militant group Hamas have been arrested 
by Israel for the shooting deaths of two Jewish settlers in August, 
an army spokesman said Sunday. All three suspects are from the village 
of Tell near the Jewish settlement of Yitzhar, home of the two settlers 
who were ambushed and shot to death on Aug. 4 while on a routine night 
patrol of the area. The suspects received direct orders to carry out 
such attacks from Adel Awadallah, a leader of the Hamas, who along 
with his brother, was shot and killed by Israeli troops five weeks 
later, the Israeli army said. The army spokesman said that several 
weapons and explosives were found at the homes of the three Hamas 
members who had planned more attacks. A Palestinian police official, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a forth member of the same 
Hamas cell was in palestinian custody. Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian 
peacemaking and has claimed responsibility for many deadly attacks 
against Israelis.
