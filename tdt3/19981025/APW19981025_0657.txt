Appealing to Jewish settlers to end staged protests across the West 
Bank and accept the new Mideast peace accord, Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu Sunday called the pact the ``best deal'' that could be achieved. 
Arriving back in Israel to a red-carpet welcome, the Israeli leader 
said security concessions won from the Palestinians during the nine-day 
summit outside Washington would justify the ceding of more West Bank 
land. ``We are returning after a long and difficult effort to bring 
... security and peace to Israel,'' he said. ``We achieved such a 
deal _ we achieved the best deal... We did something good for the 
state of Israel.'' Hours before his return home, protests by settlers 
_ who were once Netanyahu's staunchest supporters _ led to at least 
20 arrests and two police officers were hurt. Near the settlement 
of Ofra north of Jerusalem, about 50 settlers and their supporters 
rushed past Israeli police and sat cross-legged on the highway. Some 
settlers wrapped in prayer shawls held morning services at the roadside. 
Police also said settlers burned tires at the Karme Tsur settlement 
north of Hebron. ``I'm here to show that this is a sad day,'' said 
Natan El, 38, an engineer, sitting in the middle of the main north-south 
highway through the West Bank. ``We are in danger of losing our land, 
the land we have returned to after 2,000 years.'' Tensions over the 
accord also boiled over in the West Bank town of Ramallah, where infighting 
broke out among Yasser Arafat's supporters. Members of the Palestinian 
leader's political faction, Fatah, battled Palestinian security forces 
with rocks and bullets, leaving two injured. The confrontation broke 
out after Palestinian intelligence agents searched Fatah headquarters, 
looking for illegal weapons. A crackdown on unlicensed arms is one 
of the provisions of the agreement. in Israel, politicians across 
the board predicted Netanyahu would face political turmoil as a result 
of the agreement when he brings it before his right-wing Cabinet and 
the Israeli parliament for approval Monday. The agreement signed at 
the White House Friday calls for an Israeli handover of 13.1 percent 
of the West Bank to Palestinian civilian control. That means some 
Jewish settlements will be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory, 
except for access roads. Twelve hardliners in Netanyahu's government 
say they will vote against him in upcoming no-confidence motions. 
Even Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who leads the right-wing camp 
in Netanyahu's government and helped forge the agreement, said the 
withdrawal endangered Israel's security and would not reveal how he 
would vote on the deal. Netanyahu has only a one-seat majority. Hoping 
to calm settler fears, the premier made overtures to the settler community, 
but they mostly went unheard. ``I say now here to our friends listening, 
you are us, you are us and we are you. We love you and we are fighting 
for you and there is no other government that will fight like this,'' 
Netanyahu said, mentioning settler leader Ahron Dombe by name. ``I 
am very, very, very disappointed with the prime minister and the ministers 
who participated in this deal,'' Dombe said after the premier's speech. 
``Netanyahu is no longer the leader of our national camp.'' Dombe 
said his staff would begin opinion samplings among settlers Monday 
in search of a candidate to challenge Netanyahu. In a another development, 
the militant Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said its leader in the 
Gaza Strip had been arrested as part of a renewed crackdown by Arafat's 
police on militants. in a statement, faxed to news agencies, the group 
said dozens of its members had been taken into custody. The larger 
Hamas group also announced that one its West Bank leaders was under 
arrest and being held in a Palestinian jail.
