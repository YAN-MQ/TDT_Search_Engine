An Ethiopian Airlines plane landed in the Sudanese capital Sunday, 
ending a three-year suspension of Ethiopian flights to the country, 
the Egyptian news agency reported. The pilot and crew were greeted 
with flowers at Khartoum airport, the Middle East News Agency reported. 
Ethiopian Airlines will now fly twice a week between Addis Ababa and 
Khartoum, officials of the carrier have said. The resumption of flights 
signaled an improvement in relations between the two countries. Ties 
were strained in June 1995 when Ethiopia accused Sudan of aiding Muslim 
militants in an assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak in Addis Ababa. Mubarak was in the Ethiopian capital to attend 
an African summit. He escaped the attack unharmed. Ethiopia ordered 
the suspension of flights and a cut in the Sudanese diplomatic staff 
in Addis Ababa after the attack. Sudan has denied aiding the militants.
