With elections only months away, President Nelson Mandela appealed 
on Sunday to whites _ whose votes may be critical to his party _ ``to 
overcome the legacy of our divided past.'' Mandela's African National 
Congress faces a struggle to win a two-thirds majority in parliament, 
necessary to independently pass legislation aimed at redressing imbalances 
caused by decades of apartheid rule. The National Party, backed by 
Afrikaner descendants of Dutch settlers, governed during apartheid 
but is now seen by many as a relic. If enough whites abandon the party 
for the ANC, it could tip the balance in the ANC's favor. Mandela, 
speaking before a mostly white audience of 800 in an affluent suburb 
of the capital, beckoned them to think of themselves as South Africans 
first, instead of drawing racial lines. ``Our past has led us to talk 
in terms of minorities and a majority in our society,'' Mandela said. 
``But all of us can now be part of one great South African majority 
... working consciously together for shared goals. ``The most basic 
of those goals is to overcome the legacy of our divided past, in order 
to create a better life for each and every person in our land.'' The 
audience, which filled every seat in a high school auditorium, warmly 
applauded Mandela's remarks. However, some were already converted. 
Joggie Boers had been an organizer for the National Party before he 
switched to the ANC in May 1997. Boers feels he made the right choice 
in leaving a party he believes still believes in white supremacy and 
will soon be obsolete. ``They'll make a grand exit in the next election,'' 
Boers said as Mandela left the stage amid loud applause. ``I doubt 
they'll get even 4 percent of the vote.'' In South Africa's first 
all-race election in 1994 _ an event marking the end of apartheid 
_ the National Party won 20 percent of the vote. The ANC won 62 percent. 
Boers is now the secretary of the ANC's local branch in the suburb 
of East Pretoria and is an ANC member of provincial Gauteng legislature. 
He denied he switched horses simply to further his political career., 
saying it came at a cost. He said he has received death threats from 
some conservative Afrikaners who consider him a traitor. National 
Party executive director Renier Schoeman, speaking Sunday in the eastern 
city of Durban, scoffed at ``Mickey Mouse'' parties and political 
commentators who predict his party is on the brink of extinction. 
``They will have egg all over their faces when the votes are counted,'' 
Schoeman was quoted as saying by the South African Press Association. 
Mandela, in kicking off a voter registration dive on Saturday, underscored 
the importance of winning a two-thirds majority in parliament, saying: 
``If we get another 62 percent we will have failed.'' Mandela wooed 
white voters on Sunday with that in mind. ``If we want to get the 
two-thirds majority, there is only one sector we can get that from 
and that is the whites,'' Boers said. No date for the 1999 election 
has been set, but authorities say May is being considered. Mandela 
plans to retire after the election. He will likely be succeeded by 
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
