Glenn William Poorman, the president of Esso International from 1966 
until he retired in 1970, died Wednesday at his home in Crowley, La. 
He was 90. Poorman, who was born in Palmyra, Pa., fell ill at age 
12 with scarlet fever, which affected his eyesight and forced him 
to drop out of school. He recovered his health and attended Dartmouth 
College, where he majored in chemistry and graduated cum laude in 
1930. Finding it hard to get a job in the Depression, he continued 
his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he 
got a master's degree in chemical engineering. He got a job in 1932 
with the Standard Oil Co. at its huge refinery in Baton Rouge. Not 
having the money for a train ticket, he caught a ride on an oil tanker 
to the refinery. In 1934 he married Louise Gueno from Crowley, who 
was attending Louisiana State University. After 10 years of working 
at the refinery he was transferred to the company's headquarters in 
New York where he helped to plan the transition from war to peacetime 
when demand for gasoline and other products began to surge. He helped 
to set up the first system to measure management performance at the 
company. In 1959, he was named the vice-president of Esso Export, 
a Standard Oil affiliate, and in 1966 was named the president of Esso 
International, the worldwide marketing and transportation affiliate. 
Standard Oil is now known as the Exxon Corp. He is survived by his 
wife, Louise; two daughters, Louise Baenninger of Mandeville, La., 
and Sanna Randolph Thomas of Mill Valley, Calif., and three grandchildren.
