Talk of a major-league soccer dynasty died Sunday afternoon when the 
expansion Chicago Fire ended DC United's two-year reign with a 2-0 
victory in the MLS Cup. Chicago, which had lost its games against 
United this season by 3-1 and 4-1, became the first expansion team 
in a major sport in modern history to capture a championship in its 
first year. And it sent United coach Bruce Arena off to his new job 
as coach of the American national team on a sour note. Arena's new 
post will be officially announced on Tuesday in New York. ``I felt 
from the beginning that we had a unique team, and I started to feel 
that we'd compete for the championship,'' said Fire coach Bob Bradley, 
who was Arena's top assistant when United captured the first two MLS 
championships. ``For me to play against DC United in the final meant 
a great deal, because United set the standards in the league the first 
three years.'' Arena said: ``Chicago played well and deserve to be 
champions. I don't want to sound like sour grapes about the officiating, 
but we're disappointed at the controversial calls.'' Arena and others 
from DC United claimed that Chicago's goals were from offside positions, 
and they complained that the referee, Kevin Terry, should have called 
a penalty kick against Chicago on a play involving United's Marco 
Etcheverry before the game was 5 minutes old. ``The breaks went our 
way today,'' Bradley said, ``but I thought we played well for a championship 
game. Some of our players had an excellent game, from our goalkeeper 
to defense to midfield to attack.'' Bradley's team came up with the 
kind of performance that wins championship games. Chicago was very 
well organized on defense, got brilliant goalkeeping from Zach Thornton 
and counterattacked effectively. And Chris Armas did a marvelous job 
of neutralizing Etcheverry, the league's most valuable player. Peter 
Nowak assisted on both goals, by Jerzy Podbrozny in the 29th minute 
and Diego Gutierrez at the stroke of halftime, and was named the game's 
most valuable player. On both goals Chicago players appeared to be 
offside, especially Ante Razov on the second goal, but Terry and his 
two assistants did not make a call. ``In the opinion of the referee,'' 
Terry said in a statement, ``Razov, while in an offside position, 
did not interfere with the play.'' Nowak was a threat every time Chicago 
gained possession around midfield. He avoided the shadowing of Richie 
Williams by roaming various parts of the field, especially up and 
down the left flank. He often cut into the middle when necessary, 
and he forced United's defenders to move out of their positions, thus 
opening space for his teammates. Armas, another of Chicago's indefatigable 
midfielders, said that the 34-year-old Nowak's work rate ``is unbelievable 
for his age,'' adding, ``He surprises us all the time with his energy 
and his strength.'' Nowak created the first goal with a patented run 
down the left flank, on a play that started with Gutierrez passing 
to Lubos Kubik, the lanky sweeper from the Czech Republic. The ball 
went from Kubik to Razov to Nowak, for a low pass across the 6-yard 
line to Podbrozny for the finish. The second goal was all Nowak's 
work. Getting the ball down the left flank, he cut into the middle, 
avoided two defenders and took a shot. Razov was clearly in an offside 
position when Nowak's shot was deflected into the goal by Gutierrez. 
``This is a very special day for me because I never won a championship,'' 
said Nowak, who is from Poland and who played in the German league 
before going to Chicago. ``We did some good things at 1860 Munich, 
but we never won it all.'' Chicago focused on defense for most of 
the second half, allowing United to control play. The Fire was solid 
near its penalty area, and Thornton was in complete command. When 
Thornton parried Roy Lassiter's header with 15 minutes left, United's 
players grabbed their heads, knowing, perhaps, that Chicago's goal 
was impenetrable. ``We pushed,'' said John Harkes, one of the few 
United players who performed effectively, ``but Chicago handled our 
pressure well.'' Bradley said: ``The soccer community will react in 
a great way to this championship. People like to cheer for new teams.''
