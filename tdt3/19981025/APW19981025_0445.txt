An official Iraqi newspaper on Sunday derided a U.S. Congress proposal 
to spend dlrs 97 million to try to topple President Saddam Hussein 
and said the move should be condemned by the United Nations. The daily 
Al-Thawra, paper of the ruling Baath Party, raised the question of 
how Washington would react if Iraq adopted a similar measure directed 
at U.S. leaders. ``The American administration would not only refuse 
such behavior, it would even complain to the Security Council ... 
and consider Iraq's move an act of terrorism,'' said the paper. The 
U.S. measure, which would fund Iraqi opposition groups, has not yet 
been approved by the White House. It has been criticized as a misstep 
or waste of money by some in the American intelligence community and 
even some Iraqi opposition groups. Al-Thawra said the move should 
be condemned by the U.N. Security Council and the Arab League. On 
Oct. 20, the Iraqi government sent a letter to the Security Council 
asking it to stop ``illegal U.S. acts'' against Iraq, listing among 
them the effort to topple Saddam.
