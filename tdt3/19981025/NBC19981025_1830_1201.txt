When we continue -- the state of Washington prepares to vote on the 
issue of affirmative action. There is an athlete amongst us disguised 
as a mother and a neighbor. And when most of us are still sleeping, 
she's running. She also takes the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, 
and folic acid in women's ultra mega multivitamins made by general 
nutrition centers. Tomorrow, she'll get up and run some more. Women's 
ultra mega multivitamins, made exclusively by gnc. Live strong. Live 
well.
