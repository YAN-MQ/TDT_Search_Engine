Princeton's Palmer Stadium is gone, having been replaced by a new 
jewel. The Yale Bowl, which along with Palmer Stadium opened in 1914, 
still stands in New Haven, Conn. In its press box on Saturday sat 
Al Ostermann, who was overseeing the operation of the electronic scoreboard. 
For those keeping score, Ostermann has seen every Yale game there 
except one. When he learned that Palmer Stadium had worn out, Ostermann 
said he mused to himself, ``Gee, I must be getting old.'' He turned 
92 last Jan. 22. Ostermann lives in nearby Woodbridge, Conn., with 
his wife of 60 years, Eleanor. Neither boasts about his attendance 
record, which totals 522 games after Yale's 37-14 victory over Columbia 
on Saturday. What about the one game he missed? ``Yale was playing 
what they called a breather in those days, an easy opponent,'' he 
said of the game in 1930. ``It was Alfred. There was a big game scheduled 
to be played in New York at Yankee Stadium between Army and Illinois. 
So I went there.'' Ostermann has no regrets. Yale won, 66-0, and the 
Cadets nipped the Illini, 13-0. For the first game in the bowl, against 
Harvard on Nov. 21, 1914, Ostermann sneaked into the stadium early 
and hid under a bench until the kickoff. ``I was frozen,'' he said. 
His friend and contemporary at Hillhouse High School was Albie Booth, 
who became a spectacular running back and kicker for Yale from 1929 
to 1931. Booth was 5 feet 6 and 140 pounds, as was Ostermann. ``I 
wasn't much of an athlete. I wanted to go to Yale too, but I didn't 
have the Latin and the Greek, which you had to have back then to get 
in,'' Ostermann said. ``Albie went to Milford Prep for a year and 
then he got in.'' Ostermann went to Florida to seek his fortune but 
soon returned and eventually spent 36 years working for the telephone 
company. Starting in the late 1920s, Ostermann became a fixture around 
the football program, performing small duties such as helping to operate 
the scoreboard. Ostermann says he has always been a football junkie. 
``When I was younger it was nothing for me to go to three to four 
games a weekend,'' he said. ``High school on Friday, or maybe Saturday 
night, Yale on Saturday, the Giants in New York on Sundays.'' Yale 
football has changed a great deal since the days of Albie Booth. On 
Saturday, Ostermann looked out upon rows and rows of empty benches. 
The Yale Bowl's capacity is 64,269, down from 70,500 four years ago. 
The stadium was last filled in 1981 for the Harvard game. Saturday's 
attendance was 14,537. Ostermann blames television. ``I could have 
watched a dozen games between noon and midnight today, if I'd stayed 
home,'' he said. Stayed home? Perish the thought.
