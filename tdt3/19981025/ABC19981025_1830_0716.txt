Today, "the New York Times" endorsed democrat Charles Schumer in his 
challenge to Al D'Amato. It's been a close and bitter campaign, and 
their final debate was no different. New Yorkers can't trust senator 
D'Amato, not only on his statements of last week, but over and over 
and over again. The congressman has been running ads that says, "18 
years of lies." Now, are we lying when we say, congressman, that you 
missed more votes, 110 votes this year on the floor of the House of 
Representatives, than all but five congressmen in the United States? 
Is that true for not? Let me say this. Is that true or not? Let me 
say this. Is that a lie? Schumer says he has a 92% voting record over 
his congressional career.
