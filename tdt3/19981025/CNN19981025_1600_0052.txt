The ink is barely dry, but the impact of the mideast peace deal is 
already being felt in the West Bank. In Ramallah, members of Palestinian 
authority President Yasser Arafat's own political faction clashed 
with Palestinian police after agents conducted searches for illegal 
weapons. The crackdown is mandated under the new peace agreement. 
A 16-year-old activist was killed. Elsewhere in the West Bank, Jewish 
settlers protested against the accord because it concedes more land 
to Palestinians. Some Settlements will be surrounded entirely by Palestinian-controlled 
territory except for access roads. Israeli prime minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu says the security guarantees won from the Palestinians justifies 
turning over the land. These were very difficult negotiations. These 
were very difficult days and nights for me and my ministers. There 
were radical demands by the Palestinians that we rejected that were 
demands that we made. And we didn't agree to give them up. And what 
we have achieved is the best that could have been achieved. And we 
have done is something that is very important and very good for the 
state of Israel.
