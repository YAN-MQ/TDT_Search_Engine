Driving rain squalls spawned by powerful Hurricane Mitch forced churches 
to cancel Sunday services and flooded streets in the Jamaican capital. 
Under dark, menacing skies, seaports closed and buses and taxis stayed 
off Kingston's streets as Mitch, swirled in the western Caribbean 
Sea south of Jamaica. With 130-mph (215-kph) winds, Mitch was a powerful 
Category 4 hurricane. Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appealed for calm, 
shelters opened and Jamaica's defense forces went on alert. Residents 
cleared shelves of bakery items, batteries and other goods at the 
few Kingston markets open Sunday. A hurricane warning was also posted 
for eastern Cuba and a hurricane watch was in effect for the tourist 
islands of the Caymans. Colombia's tiny islands off Central America 
were also threatened, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. At 
10 a.m. (1500 GMT), Mitch was about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west-southwest 
of Kingston and 225 miles (360 kilometers) south-southeast of the 
Caymans. Crawling west-northwest at 7 mph (11 kph), its hurricane-force 
winds of at least 74 mph (118 kph) extended 45 miles (75 kilometers) 
from the center. In Jamaica, sheets of rain reduced visibility to 
a few yards (meters) as squalls pelted Kingston and Jamaica's eastern 
districts. With rain expected at least through Monday, authorities 
warned of mudslides and flash floods, especially in the mountains. 
Several airlines canceled flights, although the Kingston and Montego 
Bay airports remained open. In western Jamaica, hoteliers and tourists 
kept a wary eye on the storm's progress. ``It's not a very good beach 
day,'' said Rohan Watson, a manager at the Negril Inn in the western 
resort of Negril. Employees stockpiled food and plywood to board windows 
in case Mitch threatened, he said. ``People are still coming in. I 
think most people think the weather's going to pass,'' said Marcia 
Tomlinson, a receptionist at the Montego Bay hotel in the northwestern 
coastal resort of Montego Bay. Jamaica was struck in 1988 by Hurricane 
Gilbert, which killed 45 people. But the island was spared by Hurricane 
Georges, a storm that killed more than 500 during its rampage through 
the northeast Caribbean last month. In the Cayman Islands, a British 
colony of about 28,000, some boat owners secured their vessels and 
residents stocked up on essentials. The government allowed markets 
_ normally closed by law on Sunday _ to open and ordered public works 
employees to report to work. The annual Pirates Festival and street 
parade was rescheduled for next weekend, and a planned release of 
400 endangered green sea turtle hatchlings from Grand Cayman was postponed 
indefinitely.
