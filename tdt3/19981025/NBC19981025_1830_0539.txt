At cape Canaveral, Florida, preparations continue for John Glenn's 
voyage aboard the space shuttle "discovery." NBC's Robert Hager is 
covering the mission. As tourists begin streaming to cape Canaveral 
for Thursday's shot, across the country at the Johnson space center, 
in Houston, John glenn and his six crewmates spent today in quarantine 
-- no visitors allowed to make sure they stay healthy. Back here at 
the cape, it's four days until launch. The shuttle "discovery" is 
already waiting here on the pad. As you can see, the weather, is beautiful, 
and is expected to stay this way through Thursday. But forecasters 
will keep an eye on hurricane Mitch. Right now, it appears that high 
pressure will keep it well south of here. But they'll be watching. 
Tomorrow, the astronauts will board the T-38s they've been training 
in for one more flight, an hour and 40 minutes from Texas to the cape, 
where hundreds of thousands are expected to watch the launch in person. 
Today, some were signing a huge billboard to be presented to Glenn 
on his return. In Glenn's hometown, new Concord, Ohio, a banner flown 
over yesterday's football game read, "godspeed, John Glenn." Below, 
in the grandstand at his alma mater, muskingum college, fans spelled 
out the same message, words Glenn's fellow "Mercury" astronaut Scott 
carpenter used 36 years ago. Godspeed, John Glenn. Back then, when 
Glenn became the first American ever to orbit earth, he recalls, what 
little was known about space and its potential perils. Some of the 
doctors then predicted if you got into weightlessness, your eyes might 
change shape the vestibular functions of your inner ear might give 
you such nausea and vertigo, you wouldn't know what was going on. 
Or could you swallow, things like that. Today, astronauts can concentrate 
on the science -- studies about aging and the satellite they'll release 
to study the sun. We're not just trying to find out -- can we do it? 
We know we can. Now we're using space as a laboratory for benefit 
of everyone. The countdown begins tomorrow. Robert Hager, NBC news, 
cape Canaveral.
