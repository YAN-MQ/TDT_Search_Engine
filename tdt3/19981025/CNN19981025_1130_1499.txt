He's less than half the age of many of the great musicians he performs 
with, but they're all singing his praises. Michael Okwu talks to 17-year-old 
blues singer Jonny Lang. What do the rolling stones, B.B. king and 
Aerosmith have in common? They've all shared their stage with 17-year-old 
blues singer/songwriter jonny Lang. He's got all the ingredients. 
No doubt about it. Lovely player, great sense of timing and singing. 
He's got a voice. It's humbling to be able to go out with those guys 
and be on, you know, a Stage with those guys and just see what they're 
all about. It's very cool. It always seems like the guys who stick 
around for, you know, a long time, are always really nice. Lang hasn't 
been around for nearly as long. He picked up his first guitar only 
four years ago. It really seems like it's been like ten years or something, 
you know? Because like you said, a lot has happened. So I don't know, 
I made a lot of moves, you know, just like as far as physically moving 
places, and it's like a cool experience. Another cool experience was 
a cameo appearance in "blues brothers 2000." That was really neat. 
I got to meet a lot of really neat people. Wilson Pickett was there, 
Eddie Floyd. It was pretty cool. His first major record label release, 
"lie to me," sold over 1 million copies. On his new album, "wander 
this world," Lang is breaking away from his old style. I don't want 
to be in a row but you're making me I think I'm just trying to branch 
out more from, you know, really straight blues, and I don't know, 
there's a lot of really super rock kind of funky tunes on there. There's 
ballads, it's kind of soul music. Now here I am half a man standing 
alone I love to do this, and I hope I can keep doing this. I can keep 
my health, keep on keeping on. Meanwhile, Lang will keep on wandering 
this world, making music. Michael Okwu, "CNN Entertainment News," 
New York.
