A decisive but expected win by conservatives in elections for an assembly 
of Iran's ruling clergy was hailed by victors and losers Sunday as 
a triumph for democracy, despite the setback it might deal to President 
Mohammad Khatami's reforms. Conservatives won at least 54 places on 
the 86-seat Assembly of Experts in Friday's vote and moderates only 
13, although they were buoyed by the prospect of a lively opposition. 
Sixteen seats went to candidates whose affiliation was unclear _ but 
who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ and three to declared 
independents, who are believed closer to the moderates. ``We took 
a step _ however small _ toward the democratization of Iranian society 
in a reformist manner,'' said Saeid Laylaz, of the Executives of Construction 
party, which supports Khatami. Sunday's results came as no surprise 
since most moderates were dropped from the ballot in advance by the 
Council of Guardians, which determines eligibility and is dominated 
by hard-liners. Many moderate groups decided not to enter the race 
to protest the ban on the progressive theologians. The council had 
reviewed a list of 396 applicants, but allowed only 167 to stand as 
candidates. Still Laylaz said that even with 15 percent of the seats, 
the moderates will carry clout, having substantial say in the running 
of the assembly, including oversight of the country's supreme leader 
and the choice of his successor. ``These 15 members will no doubt 
become members of some kind of a committee in the assembly or will 
form a powerful faction to make sure the assembly works more vigorously 
and better than it has been doing in the past,'' Laylaz told The Associated 
Press. Not all agreed. Assadollah Badamchian, a leader of the powerful 
and ultra-conservative Islamic Coalition Group, said the Assembly 
of Experts has always functioned strictly according to the country's 
constitution. Instead, he saw the vote itself as the real success. 
``The elections showed that democracy in Islam exists in the true 
sense,'' said Badamchian, whose camp wants to maintain the absolute 
powers of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. ``It proved that Iran 
is the most democratic country in the region.'' In recent months, 
hard-liners like Badamchian also have battled Khatami's efforts to 
grant more freedom to the press and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures 
on the average citizen _ all reforms that have garnered Khatami widespread 
support across Iran. Nationwide, about 18 million, or 47 percent, 
of the 38.5 million eligible voters cast ballots. Many Iranians, however, 
were skeptical of the numbers, even though there was no significant 
indication of any vote rigging. Others compared Friday's vote to last 
year's presidential elections when some 30 million cast ballots, 20 
million of them for Khatami, whose tenure has presented the biggest 
challenge to conservatives since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Last 
year, ``people voted with all their hearts,'' said Farshid Moeini, 
21, who sells watches at a shop in western Tehran. ``Then, there was 
competition. This time, people didn't care very much because there 
was no real contest,'' added Moeini, who said he voted Friday although 
he didn't know any of the candidates. ``I voted just because I felt 
it was my duty,'' he said. In Sunday's session of Parliament, the 
powerful and hard-line speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, thanked the 
Iranian people for their ``splendid'' participation in the polls. 
Of the 7.1 million eligible voters in Tehran, a key district, only 
1.68 million cast ballots, official figures showed. Voters there could 
choose up to 16 candidates. Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former president 
who remains influential and has sided with moderates, had 1,682,882 
votes, the most of any candidate. Behind him was hard-liner Ali Meshkini, 
the current head of the Assembly of Experts, who had 1,240,524 votes. 
Hard-liners grabbed 11 of the 16 seats in Tehran and moderates only 
five. Among the hard-liners who won in the capital were Mohammad Yazdi, 
head of the powerful judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, who leads the council 
that vetted the candidates. The election for the assembly is held 
every eight years.
