In an ominous outbreak of internal conflict stemming from the new 
peace accord, members of Yasser Arafat's political faction fought 
street battles Sunday with Palestinian security forces, injuring two 
men. The clash, representing a serious rupture within Arafat's ranks, 
followed a bid by Palestinian military intelligence to seize unlicensed 
weapons. That was among tough new security measures Arafat agreed 
to at last week's U.S. summit. The fighting in the center of the West 
Bank town of Ramallah broke out as Marwan Barghouti, the leader of 
Fatah in the West Bank, was addressing a group of about 100 supporters 
outside the Palestinian Authority headquarters and the offices of 
Governor Mustafa Isa. Some of the Fatah activists picked up stones 
and hurled them over a fence into the compound and at plainclothes 
intelligence agents who were watching the gathering from the sidelines, 
witnesses said. Intelligence agents hurled rocks back at the crowd. 
But then some of the security agents fired from the second- and third-floor 
windows, with some of the gunfire directed into the crowd. About the 
same time, armed Fatah members arrived on the scene, firing shots 
into the air. Two men were hurt, including a Fatah activist who suffered 
a gunshot wound to the head. That silenced the gunfire on both sides, 
and leaders from both sides quickly withdrew for a meeting. A senior 
Fatah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the confrontation 
followed a search Saturday night of Fatah headquarters by members 
of Palestinian intelligence. Fistfights broke out as the searchers 
went through files and looked for unlicensed weapons, the official 
said. Some Fatah activists said the confrontation was exacerbated 
by a personal feud between the commander of the raiding party and 
two Fatah members. Merchants in the center of town shuttered their 
shops, and burning tires and overturned garbage bins littered the 
streets. The fighting occurred entirely in Palestinian-controlled 
areas, and Israeli troops were not involved.
