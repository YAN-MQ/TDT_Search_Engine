A member of the Islamic militant Jihad group died Saturday in a shootout 
with Albanian special police in a Tirana suburb, authorities reported 
Sunday. Salah el Saeid, a 29-year-old Egyptian citizen, was considered 
one of the most dangerous people wanted by the U.S. Central Intelligence 
Agency, Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga told The Associated 
Press. Saeid was wanted for threatening the U.S. Embassy in Tirana 
in August, Bizhga said. He reportedly lived in Tirana and was married 
to an Albanian woman. Saeid reportedly started shooting around 8 p.m. 
(1800 GMT) Saturday from a first-floor window after he saw police 
forces around his house, which had been under observation by the Albanian 
secret service. The commander of the special police was wounded during 
the one-hour shootout. A first report issued by the Interior Ministry 
said Saeid was found dead on the floor. Later Bizhga said the Egyptian 
had committed suicide. On Aug. 17, 120 heavily armed U.S. Marines 
tightened security at the American diplomatic compound in Tirana after 
U.S. officials said they received credible evidence of a plan to attack 
the U.S. mission. The embassy temporarily suspended normal operations, 
evacuating family members and nonessential personnel.
