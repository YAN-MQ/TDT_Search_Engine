"Headline Sports" is next. I thought you quit smoking. I did. really? 
What's up with that? It's a nicotrol inhaler. It gives me the nicotine 
I need to fight my cravings... and help me quit. Really? But you can 
only use it for up to six months, and you have to use it as part of 
a stop-smoking program. You have to stop smoking first, then... you 
can't use it with anything else containing nicotine. It's important 
to tell your doctor if you have heart or lung disease... or are pregnant 
or nursing. The most common side effects are mild throat or mouth 
irritation, cough and upset stomach. How do I look? Surprisingly intelligent. 
Ask your doctor for product information. You've been to some nice 
places. Yes I have. Singapore was terrific. That's the prime minister 
of some...something. you see this? Scary. Fatima. Big star. 52 countries 
in two years. This new software I've installed, it's gonna save your 
life. It's called "lotus notes." It lets you collaborate on projects 
all over the world. You never have to leave the office. It's gonna 
be great to have you around. It's a battle for control.
