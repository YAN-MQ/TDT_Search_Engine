NATIONAL FORECAST Clusters of locally heavy showers and a few potent 
thunderstorms will sweep across the southern Rockies as advancing 
cold air at high levels encounters increasingly moist air over the 
region. Gusty winds will accompany many of the showers. Farther north, 
heavy snow will fall at elevations above 8,000 feet across the central 
Rockies where accumulations over a foot will occur. In the wake of 
the storm system, the West Coast states will be mainly dry. Areas 
of low clouds and fog will occur Monday morning from the Central Valley 
of California to the northwest coast. Otherwise, a mixture of clouds 
and sunshine will prevail. An increasing flow of warm air from the 
south will rise over slightly cooler air, resulting in clouds and 
patchy rain over parts of Nebraska and South Dakota. The southern 
Plains will be partly cloudy and mild, though a few thunderstorms 
will develop in western sections later Monday as a jet-stream disturbance 
arrives from the southwest. After a cool dawn, the Southeast will 
have another mainly sunny and warm day. Sunshine will be abundant 
although some puffy clouds and a few isolated showers are expected 
near the east coast of Florida Dry, chilly air will surge into New 
England in the wake of a front. A band of clouds and some isolated 
sprinkles will occur near the edge of the cool air mass from the northern 
Great Lakes to the interior Northeast. Meanwhile, intense Hurricane 
Mitch with central winds over 140 miles an hour will drift slowly 
to the northwest over the western Caribbean. Focus: Pollution Season 
Fair weather can bring about severe pollution. In late October 1948, 
Donora, Pa., was in the midst of the worst air-quality disaster in 
the nation's history as 20 people died from a fog poisoned with industrial 
smoke. The tranquil high-pressure systems of fall favor pollution. 
Sinking air that accompanies autumn's high-pressure systems acts like 
a tight lid to trap pollutants near the ground. Light winds, another 
hallmark of high pressure, cannot disperse pollutants. Autumn highs 
often move slowly, allowing pollution episodes to sometimes last a 
week.
