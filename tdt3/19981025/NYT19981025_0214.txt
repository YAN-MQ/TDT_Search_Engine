Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer laid out sharply different 
views on tax cuts, gun control and abortion rights Sunday during a 
free-flowing, if clamorous, debate in which each Senate candidate 
struggled to set the agenda for the final week of his campaign. In 
a debate marked by sarcastic retorts and repeated instances in which 
each man tried to talk over the other _ ``Gentlemen, gentlemen, this 
is getting out of hand!'' the moderator, Gabe Pressman, implored at 
one point in an effort to restore order _ Schumer and D'Amato spent 
much of their time trying to discredit each other's credentials. D'Amato 
once again asserted that Schumer had neglected his duties in Washington 
this year in order to campaign, while Schumer described D'Amato as 
untrustworthy and extreme. But unlike the first debate, which took 
place 17 hours earlier in Schenectady, this one showed the two candidates, 
nudged by the moderator, in an exchange of views on issues that has 
largely been absent through much of this campaign. Schumer assailed 
D'Amato for repeatedly voting against abortion rights and gun control 
and for supporting much of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract 
With America. D'Amato assailed Schumer for supporting a series of 
tax increases in Congress, opposing the 1996 welfare bill and voting 
against authorizing President George Bush to use force against Saddam 
Hussein in the Persian Gulf. These exchanges of views were made, though, 
in anything but an orderly manner. Pressman is known for staging debates 
without rules, and both D'Amato and Schumer, two of the more combative 
politicians that New York has produced in the last 10 years, sought 
to make the most of that televised opportunity. They almost stumbled 
over each other grabbing for the questions, cutting each other off 
and talking over each other. ``Please let me finish, sir,'' Schumer 
said, as D'Amato challenged his assertions about his support for tax 
cuts. ``I didn't interrupt you. So don't interrupt me.'' At another 
point, D'Amato said, ``You're being rude,'' and glared at Schumer 
as the congressman badgered the senator to account for his votes against 
abortion rights. At one point, D'Amato wrinkled his face in exasperation 
as Schumer assailed his credibility. ``Oh my God,'' he muttered, with 
a loud sigh. ``May I finish?'' Schumer asked Pressman. ``Well, you 
never finish,'' D'Amato responded. The two men, meeting in the second 
of the only two debates D'Amato would agree to, sat in gray armchairs 
at WNBC studios at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. D'Amato was stern 
and mostly unsmiling, pointing his fingers and extending his arms 
to make his point. Schumer was more relaxed, staring straight into 
the camera as he spoke, slipping on a pair of black-rimmed reading 
glasses as he read portions of an editorial endorsing him in Newsday, 
as he tried to rebut D'Amato's criticism about his attendance record. 
On crime, both men invoked different bills on which they differed 
in order to put themselves in the strongest light. D'Amato pointed 
to legislation that would, among other things, provide for extra penalties 
for crimes that were committed with a gun, and a bill that would require 
mandatory sentences for repeat felons. Schumer heralded his crime 
bill, which included money for local police officers, a broadening 
of the federal death penalty and tougher penalties for multiple offenders. 
The two men demonstrated one clear difference on fighting crime: gun 
control. Schumer challenged D'Amato for opposing his bills to restrict 
the number of assault weapons and to license some handguns, setting 
off a tangled exchange between them. ``Senator, why are you opposed 
to them when so many New Yorkers want them?'' Schumer asked, referring 
to the bills. ``Can you answer the question?'' D'Amato responded by 
noting his efforts to pass legislation increasing penalties for crimes 
committed with guns. ``Congressman, the difference in our approach 
is _ '' ``Are you going to answer the question?'' Schumer said. D'Amato 
continued, ``I'm for going after the criminal, as opposed to attempting 
to pass more laws.'' On taxes, D'Amato repeatedly assailed Schumer 
for consistently voting in favor of Democratic tax bills over the 
years. D'Amato said that by his count, they added up to $1 trillion, 
``so when we call you a tax-and-spend liberal, it's there.'' ``I voted 
against raising those taxes on middle-class families, on farmers,'' 
D'Amato said. ``The congressman voted to tax everything that's alive, 
and even people who have died.'' Referring to 1993 legislation pushed 
by Democrats to balance the budget _ with a combination of spending 
cuts and tax increases _ D'Amato added, ``Yours was the deciding vote 
to have the greatest tax increase in the history of the country.'' 
Schumer seized on D'Amato's opening to align himself with President 
Clinton, who remains extremely popular in New York. Clinton has argued 
that that bill laid the groundwork for the nation's current economic 
prosperity, including the elimination of the federal deficit. ``The 
1993 vote that President Clinton put together is a vote that turned 
America around,'' Schumer said. ``It helped account for our present 
prosperity. It helped create hundreds of thousands of jobs. It helped 
do all kinds of things that the Republican Party had been unable to 
do and help balance the budget.'' The two clashed as well on abortion 
rights. D'Amato, without ever noting outright that he opposes abortion 
rights, argued that there should be tolerance of different views on 
the issue. ``It's a matter of conscience,'' said D'Amato, who is running 
with the support of the Right to Life Party. ``And it's a contentious 
issue,'' he said. ``And I can't change on it. And people know where 
I stand. But I have voted for these exceptions 18 times. And here's 
the record. And the congressman would try to becloud that.'' D'Amato 
was referring to legislation that allowed for abortion in cases of 
rape, incest or when the mother's life was in danger. But Schumer 
noted that D'Amato had voted just as often for bills that included 
no such exemptions. ``How can New Yorkers trust a man like Al D'Amato 
on this issue?'' Schumer said. ``You know, I do respect your view, 
senator. And there is tolerance. I have lots of friends who have the 
same view as you. But have the decency, the honor and the courage 
to come clean and say that you are strongly pro-life and you believe 
in it. And I will say I'm pro-choice and I believe in it. And we'll 
let the chips fall where they may.''
