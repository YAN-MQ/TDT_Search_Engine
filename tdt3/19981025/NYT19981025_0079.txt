After six months of intensive discussions about the extent to which 
newsrooms fail to reflect the ethnic diversity of the country, the 
governing board of the American Society of Newspaper Editors agreed 
last week that ``the nation's newsrooms must reflect the racial diversity 
of American society by 2025 or sooner.'' The board, which met in Miami, 
also agreed to include women in its annual census of newsrooms, an 
attempt to monitor the extent to which a ``glass ceiling'' prevents 
them from rising to the highest positions in American newsrooms. Until 
now, the 20-year-old census has tracked only employment and general 
job categories for black, Asian-American, Hispanic and Native American 
employees. Some board members had expressed concern that adding women 
could distract from the goal of increasing the number of minority 
journalists. The society, made up of 860 editors from around the country, 
has no power to force any of its members to pursue its goals. Nevertheless, 
the reconsideration of the goals and timetables established by the 
group in 1978 was an emotionally charged process, in part because 
it was increasingly clear that the original goal _ ethnic parity of 
newsroom populations with the country at large by 2000 _was unattainable. 
At the time the goal was set, only about 4 percent of newsroom employees 
were from minority groups and it was anticipated that 15 percent of 
the national population would be minorities in 2000. At the beginning 
of 1998, the society's census showed that minority journalists made 
up 11.5 percent of newsroom employees. But minorities comprise about 
26 percent of the national population. The new goal is considered 
ambitious by some in the profession who point to an annual attrition 
rate of about 10 percent in newsrooms and to the difficulty in attracting 
minority students to journalism schools. Edward Seaton, society president 
and editor of The Manhattan (Kan.) Mercury, said in a statement, ``In 
the end, we will be measured as much for our efforts as for our aspirations.'' 
The group's new mission statement also calls for setting benchmarks 
and monitoring progress every three years in such areas as reducing 
turnover among minority employees and increasing minority scholarships 
and internships.
