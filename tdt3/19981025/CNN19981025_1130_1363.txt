Remember, for all the scores of today's action, stay tuned to the 
"Sportsticker." Anthony Keith James, "Headline Sports." It's cajun 
country, Mississippi state and LSU. Tigers quarterback herb Tyler 
gets a bad snap. But watch as he is able to collect the ball, then 
avoid the rush and throw a perfect running strike to Kevin Faulk for 
the touchdown and the "play of the day." These days, seems like everybody's 
got a Cherokee or an explorer. me? I like to stand out a bit. That's 
why I drive a Subaru outback. With a big cargo bay and all-wheel drive, 
you get all the sport-utility you need. With a smooth ride and better 
gas mileage, the outback is far from ordinary. Like me, really. What 
a weird looking bunch that was.
