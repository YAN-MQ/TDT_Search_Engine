Yugoslavia has not yet lived up to its bargain to pull troops out 
of the kosovo province. According to secretary of state Madeleine 
Albright, there has been some compliance but not enough. Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic has until Tuesday to remove his forces. 
With that deadline looming, NATO generals, including supreme commander 
wesley Clark, spent the weekend meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade. 
Clark has the authority to launch air strikes if Serb forces do not 
leave kosovo as promised. Earlier today, sniper fire disrupted the 
funeral of an 11-year-old ethnic albanian boy. He was killed yesterday 
while chopping wood. His family blames Serb police for his death.
