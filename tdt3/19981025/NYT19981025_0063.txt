From broom closet to book jacket comes an evolving literary definition 
of the thoroughly mainstream witch: a teen-age girl casting economy 
spells on crabby teachers, or a sleek Wiccan high priestess with a 
coven, a law degree and three press agents to promote the resulting 
spiritual memoir. ``Why am I writing this book?'' said Phyllis Curott, 
44, a New York lawyer with her own practice and a Circle of Ara coven, 
whose ``Book of Shadows'' shares with readers her religious enlightenment 
as well as mugwort potions for psychic dreams. ``You don't want to 
get hate mail, but you make choices. And I feel that we're at a critical 
moment in our history, and I really deeply believe that people may 
change their attitudes by reading about an educated professional who 
is a witch.'' To achieve this goal, she has carefully cultivated an 
image as a hip, upwardly mobile witch, wearing a strappy brown Morgan 
leFay dress and wispy blond hair for her dust jacket, Donna Karan 
for the publicity photos. She hired one independent public relations 
agency to promote her book among readers of New Age spiritual books, 
another to work with the mainstream audience. A media coach provided 
her with tips on demeanor and earthly sound bites. ``The most important 
thing is to shine the light of truth on this and dispose the negative 
stereotypes of the green-faced hideous hag,'' she said. ``What I'm 
hoping to reveal is that behind the mask of an evil witch is the ancient 
and very beautiful face of the goddess.'' And so are an assortment 
of other young and middle-aged witches whose rising literary output 
of self-help titles and memoirs is propelled, in part, by a yearning 
for social acceptance and a growing demand for information about the 
highly individual, nature-based folk religion of Wicca, which worships 
ancient deities and, as one author put it, has suffered from ``centuries 
of bad press.'' The wide assortment of books has reaped some authors 
six-figure advances and contracts with large publishing houses. Other 
writers complain that literary openness has cost them friends and, 
in some cases, day jobs that augmented meager royalty checks. Increasing 
demand has also inspired some smaller publishers to stack their lists 
with witchcraft titles and to haunt New Age trade shows and witch 
camps and retreats in search of new talent and themes that are reaching 
_ and in some cases targeting _ an audience of teen-age girls. No 
title has actually soared on a broomstick to the top of a best-seller 
list, but publishers large and small have found that many of the books 
are steady perennial sellers. Over the last two decades, the literature 
has evolved from academic and scholarly books to more practical titles 
that young women and housewives are willing to buy, said Karen Bouris, 
director of marketing for Harper San Francisco. In the late 1980s, 
sales of Wicca titles averaged about 3,000 to 4,000 copies a year 
at Carol Publishing Group, but in the last two years sales have increased, 
with some of the popular titles selling up to 40,000, said Steven 
Schragis, the publisher. ``Every morning I put a spell on Random House 
and Simon &AMP; Schuster, using nothing you can't buy in a regular 
grocery store _ Velveeta, paprika and Orange Crush,'' joked Schragis, 
who has expanded the company's list of Wiccan titles from 2 to 29, 
including guides for men, young witches and gardeners. But no spell 
could stop the large publishing houses, which are also pursuing literary 
witches. In November, Bantam Books is preparing to publish ``Circle 
Round,'' Starhawk's how-to book on raising a second generation of 
witches, while Harper San Francisco is promoting its ``fun and empowering'' 
guide, ``Be a Goddess!'' For $9.99, St. Martin's Press is offering 
``The Supermarket Sorceress' Enchanted Evenings,'' by Lexa Rosean, 
who manages Enchantment, a white-magic shop in Manhattan. The paperback 
provides easy-mix recipes for spells concocted from widely available 
ingredients. (Apartment-hunting spell: tinfoil, cinnamon, salt, sugar, 
bread, pennies.) With its lack of a central hierarchy and rigid rules, 
the earth-based religion of Wicca draws members from a mix of movements: 
feminists, environmentalists and New Age seekers who worship the gods 
and goddesses of nature by casting sacred circles and celebrating 
the changing seasons. This leaves wide room for interpretation of 
rituals, some dating back to pre-Christian religions, others rising 
from merely mundane modern issues like dealing with a balky computer 
mouse. ``The rituals today come from a variety of places,'' said Helen 
Berger, an associate professor of sociology at West Chester University 
in Pennsylvania, who has written a book about modern witchcraft. ``These 
are very avid readers who have recreated older practices throughout 
the world and usually mixed them with modern issues and concerns about 
gender equity. Some of the rituals come from people's re-creations 
or from movies and novels and poetry.'' Wicca members tend to be white, 
college-educated, middle-class women, many of whom have families, 
said Ms. Berger, who said the religion was becoming more institutionalized 
as the members aged. ``It was fun to be an outsider and a witch in 
their 20s,'' she said, ``and now they are in their 40s and they want 
acceptance for their children.'' The fear of a backlash has never 
disappeared, said Ms. Berger, who added that the false stereotype 
that witches worship Satan endures. She cited several examples of 
women whose religious views raised anxiety in Texas and Tennessee, 
where she said a mother joined a Christian church to avoid losing 
her children in a custody case that uncovered her interest in Wiccan 
themes and books. Silver RavenWolf, formerly Jeanine Trayer, is a 
32-year-old onetime Baptist and mother of four from the Harrisburg, 
Pa., area who has just published a guide called ``Teen Witch,'' intended 
precisely for a new generation of witches. Her own children have been 
initiated into the religion, but she said they have faced taunts from 
their peers for their beliefs. She said her sons had been teased and 
her daughter's school locker had been painted with derogatory slogans. 
Her daughters actually advised her, she said, in writing her book, 
which offers 30 spells made with low-cost and accessible ingredients. 
Still, she discourages young would-be witches from starting their 
own covens until they are adults who can train with older witches. 
``I have letters from kids saying their parents have burned their 
books and destroyed their altars,'' the author said. ``Basically, 
it's because of a misconception, and what they fear isn't true. Hollywood 
movies and bad publicity have made witches look evil and that they 
hurt people and they really don't. I'm just as worried about my own 
kids out there in the world today.'' Even so, other publishers express 
wariness about publishing a book that is so clearly intended for the 
teen-age market. ``We talked about, and we didn't do it,'' said Schragis, 
of Carol Publishing. ``We have stayed away from publishing a book 
that specifically uses the word teen or teen-ager'' in the title. 
``Teen Witch'' is published by Llewellyn International, a company 
based in St. Paul with a long history of publishing astrology books 
and annual revenues of $17 million. Two years ago, the company's executives 
noticed a surge in sales with the popularity of ``The Craft,'' a B-movie 
about a small coven of good, bad and moderately well-behaved teen-age 
witches dressed in knee-highs and school uniforms by day, hip clothes 
by night. Llewellyn responded by publishing a variety of books on 
witchcraft for beginners, including ``Teen Witch,'' with a cover of 
bemused 15-year-old girls in jeans and short skirts posed like a movie 
poster for ``The Craft.'' Today, more than half of the 100 titles 
that Llewellyn publishes annually revolve around Wiccan themes. ``Our 
typical reader had been a boomer who grew up in the '60s who had been 
looking for a more appealing explanation of spirituality,'' said Von 
Braschler, Llewellyn's director of trade sales. ``Now our typical 
reader is becoming a very young woman in her teens. We're basing this 
on the letters we get for the authors.'' Llewellyn's authors typically 
receive no advances and hold other jobs to supplement their royalties. 
Their experiences are far less glamorous than those of authors like 
Ms. Curott, who was able to sell her memoir on the strength of her 
background to a large publisher after a competitive auction with five 
bidding companies. ``It gave me tremendous credibility,'' Ms. Curott 
said of her education at Brown University and her law degree from 
New York University. ``When people think of Wicca, they think of either 
Satanism or silly mumbo jumbo.'' Dorothy Morrison, 43, a Llewellyn 
author of ``Everyday Magic'' and ``Everyday Needlework,'' said she 
learned this lesson the hard way in the Missouri town where she lives 
and has tried to promote her work as a budding author of witchcraft 
titles. She suspects that she was dismissed in June from her job at 
an animal shelter near Jackson, Mo., after a bookstore clerk recognized 
her name and picture on one of the books that described her as a Wiccan 
high priestess. ``People are afraid of what they don't understand,'' 
said Ms. Morrison, 43, a former Roman Catholic whose books offer spells 
for coping with computer crashes or speeding up modems. ``Unfortunately, 
it does no good to educate people in this area because they don't 
want to be educated.'' ``New Age authors really don't make a lot of 
money,'' she added. ``I'm fortunate my husband makes good money, and 
yes, I'm missing my salary from the animal shelter. I read cards when 
I go to book signings. I'm allowed to do workshops, and _ goddess 
willing _ I'll be able to find a job to work full time.''
