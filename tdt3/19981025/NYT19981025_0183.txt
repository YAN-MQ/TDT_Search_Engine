NEW YORK _ NBC plans to name a new president for its entertainment 
division Monday, setting up a transition that will eventually put 
all the network's entertainment operations under the executive, Scott 
Sassa, senior NBC officials said Sunday. As president, Sassa will 
replace Warren Littlefield, who, with 20 years at NBC, is one of the 
longest-serving program executives in the history of television, despite 
being only 46 years old. Littlefield has been a central figure in 
developing and scheduling some of the most popular TV shows of the 
past decade, including ``Seinfeld,'' ``Cheers'' and ``Law and Order.'' 
The senior NBC executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
the network had decided to move Sassa, who is 39 years old, from his 
current job as president of NBC's station division, to set up a transition 
period during which Sassa could work under NBC's top entertainment 
executive, Don Ohlmeyer, before taking over for Ohlmeyer when he decides 
to step down. Ohlmeyer's contract expires at the end of 2000 and he 
has told friends he is likely to leave his present job at that time 
to go back to producing shows. One senior NBC executive said Sunday 
that Littlefield had not been seen as a suitable successor to Ohlmeyer. 
NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., concluded a deal with Littlefield 
Sunday to create a joint-venture production company that he will head. 
Littlefield's contract as president of entertainment had extended 
through 2001. In a telephone interview Sunday, Littlefield called 
the arrangement with NBC for a production company ``a gold-standard 
deal,'' adding, ``I feel really sensational about that.'' Littlefield 
said he had begun to think about leaving his position last Christmas 
when Jerry Seinfeld told him he would be quitting his show. ``I think 
when Jerry said he realized it was time to move on to the next phase 
of his life, I started to think seriously about my own choice,'' Littlefield 
said. ``When it became clear that Don was not going to go beyond his 
contract, and as it became clear that Scott would be a player for 
the network, I also got very comfortable with the idea that it's time 
for me to move on to chapter two of my life.'' No other executive 
affected by the decision responded to requests for comment Sunday. 
But one senior executive said Ohlmeyer, who had been an Emmy-Award 
winning producer of sports and entertainment shows before joining 
NBC, ``wants to get back to making shows.'' Another senior NBC executive, 
who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ``This is about getting 
an orderly transition in place.'' The executive noted that Sassa had 
been brought to NBC last year after running the entire entertainment 
operation for Turner Broadcasting. He said that, in essence, Sassa 
had been temporarily parked in his job overseeing NBC's stations to 
await an opening in entertainment. With NBC's top management concluding 
that Littlefield would not succeed Ohlmeyer, the executive added, 
``it was logical to turn to Scott.'' Sassa will assume Littlefield's 
post Monday, the senior executives said. Littlefield said he would 
help with the transition any way he could, but emphasized that he 
was eager to begin work on shows. Littlefield leaves with a legacy 
as a main architect of NBC's thick catalog of programming hits in 
the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1980s he was the chief program executive 
under Brandon Tartikoff, who then led NBC's entertainment division. 
During that time, Littlefield helped develop many of the network's 
biggest hits, including ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Hill Street Blues,'' 
``Cheers,'' ``The Golden Girls'' and ``St. Elsewhere.'' After Tartikoff 
left NBC in 1991, Littlefield was named president of entertainment 
and ran the division. But NBC's hit shows were aging, and the network 
entered a period of steep decline. During that time NBC did add hits 
like ``Seinfeld'' and ``Mad About You,'' though both took years to 
emerge. NBC realigned the management of its entertainment division 
in February 1993, bringing in Ohlmeyer to supervise all entertainment 
operations as president of NBC West Coast. Littlefield retained his 
title of president, but reported to Ohlmeyer. Under the Ohlmeyer-Littlefield 
team, NBC soon reasserted total control of prime time, beating its 
rival networks by record margins. Within two years, NBC added a group 
of hits _ ``Frasier,'' ``Friends'' and ``E.R.'' _ that helped push 
NBC to record profits exceeding $500 million a year. Littlefield was 
also involved in another pivotal decision for NBC. At the end of Johnny 
Carson's 30-year reign as host of the ``Tonight'' show, NBC was torn 
between two successors, Jay Leno and David Letterman. Littlefield 
pushed hard for Leno and he got the job. Letterman left for CBS where 
his new show initially topped Leno's. But after two years, NBC's prime-time 
comeback was matched by Leno's ascendancy to late-night leadership; 
his show is now the network's most profitable entertainment program.
