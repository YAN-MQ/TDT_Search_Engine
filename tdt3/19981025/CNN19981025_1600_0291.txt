The floodwaters in Texas have receded, but thousands of families in 
the southern part of the state are still trying to recover. Brian 
Cabell reports. For five days, they have been shut out of their homes, 
victims of a raging Colorado river. But now they were being allowed 
to return. We did an aerial assessment this morning, and the damage 
does not seem to be quite as bad as we might have thought earlier. 
That's what their mayor said. But 87-year-old lurleen Johnson and 
her grandkids would find out for themselves. Phew! Her tiny wooden 
home did smell. The river had crept inside at its highest level. Oh, 
yes. See, the water's got everywhere. It soaked the rug and linoleum. 
Everywhere. Most of Ms. Johnson's furniture seemed spared. A good 
thing, because she lives on social security and has no money for new 
purchases. Gas off. The gas had been cut. So had the electricity. 
But the house and most of its belongings seem salvageable. She'll 
return to the Shelter for at least one more night, but then she and 
her grandchildren will work on repairs. About 600 homes were flooded 
here in Wharton. Fortunately, there were no casualties. But after 
five days of evacuation, five days of living in shelters and motels, 
frustrations were building up. Yo, man, you can't afford that. Residents, 
quite simply, were tired of waiting. I have my money budgeted to take 
care of my bills and my car note. Now how are we gonna feed? And I 
got a family of four kids in there and a grandchild. National guard 
troops and police were understanding as they blocked the roads and 
tended to the children. There you go. Cookies and crackers for the 
hungry. You're welcome. In fact, the red cross served full meals for 
the residents. And just before re-entering into the neighborhood, 
tetanus and diphtheria shots were offered. That's a concern -- disease 
in the wake of the flood. But for now residents are satisfied. They're 
going home. Yeah, we got a long walk. But we're gonna make it. Brian 
Cabell, CNN, Wharton, Texas. See Y'all later.
