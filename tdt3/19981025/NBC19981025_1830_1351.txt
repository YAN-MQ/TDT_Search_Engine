To Washington state now, where in nine days, ballots will be cast 
on one of this country's most controversial issues. Here's NBC's Dan 
Lothian. Facing off in the battle over affirmative action in Washington 
state. On the streets. On television. It goes too far. I-200 means 
affirmative action -- And in heated debates. We're talking about whether 
or not to preserve equality of opportunity. You have to apply the 
same standard to everyone. Ward connerly was the architect of California's 
successful anti-affirmative action ballot measure prop 209, which 
voters approved two years ago. But some say, I-2oo, which would outlaw 
preferences based on race or sex in school admissions, state contracts 
and hiring, is turning back the clock. If you look at the way their 
language is written, I don't know how you can conclude that it doesn't 
abolish affirmative action. In a state, 85% white, there are feelings 
that what once may have worked, needs to be fixed. We now have a system 
in place that literally encourages people to play up their racial 
differences in order to get ahead. But some here say race is not the 
issue, because the people who benefit most from affirmative action 
are women. And Ruth Gerber blumrosen, a lawyer who recently co-authored 
a study on this issue, says women still face an uphill battle. I think 
it's horrible that so many of them are being deprived of employment 
opportunities. Even though there's little common ground in this debate, 
both sides do overwhelming agree on one thing, that whatever the outcome 
of their battle here in the state of Washington, it will most likely 
influence what happens around the country. Andrea Simpson, is an assistant 
professor at the University of Washington, specializing in race and 
politics. The harm in affirmative action is all about perception. 
It's probably one of the most important and one of the most understudied 
policies we've ever had. And one which brings out strong emotions. 
So far polls indicate most voters in Washington state, support outlawing 
it. Dan Lothian, NBC news, Seattle.
