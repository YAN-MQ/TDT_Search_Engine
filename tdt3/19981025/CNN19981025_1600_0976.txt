Halloween is just around the corner, and that means big business for 
some retailers. But as Anne McDermott reports, it's not just kid business. 
Aw, look at the little halloweenies. First halloween. It was too much 
for her. But not for the big kids. Welcome to knott's Berry farm. 
In the summer, a gentle kiddie park. In the fall, a gorefest for grown-UPS. 
I'm not too old to enjoy halloween. no, ma'am. Lots of adults do. 
A third of all adults in the U.S. will be wearing costumes this year, 
and it's the second biggest party day after new year's. And here in 
Los Angeles -- I bet people spend more money on halloween than they 
will be doing at christmas. And for that, you can thank folks like 
the sonntags. When it comes to halloween, they spend a fearsome amount 
of money. Well, I thought I was gonna get out of here pretty cheap, 
but it's $690.01. And you know, they got off cheap. They could have 
purchased this charming ensemble for $4,600. $4,600? Chump change, 
says the manager of this year-round halloween store. I have a lot 
of foreign people from the orient come in, and they may spend $10,000, 
easily. And halloween's increasing popularity has been a boon to professionals 
like elvira. She's a professional -- eh, well, whatever. For me, it's 
more jobs, more money, more merchandising, yeah! But when you're 2, 
it can be too much. Scary! It's scary? Silly grown-UPS. Imagine paying 
someone to scare the bejeebers out of you. but we do. Anne McDermott, 
CNN, Los Angeles.
