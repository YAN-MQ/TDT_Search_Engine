Israel on Sunday allowed 20,000 more Palestinian workers from the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip to enter Israel, bringing the total to 54,000. 
The step takes the the Palestinian workforce in Israel back to nearly 
full strength. About 60,000 Palestinians have permits to work in Israel. 
In recent weeks, Israel has gradually raised the number of Palestinian 
workers allowed in, after imposing strict closures of the Palestinian 
lands during recent Jewish holidays. Israel had sealed its border 
with the West Bank and Gaza on Sept. 20, just before the start of 
the Jewish holidays, which began with the New Year, followed by Yom 
Kippur and Sukkot, or the Feast of the Tabernacles. That followed 
warnings by the Islamic militant group Hamas that it would carry out 
major attacks or kidnap Israeli soldiers. Closures cause extensive 
economic hardship in the Palestinian areas, where unemployment is 
high. Palestinian leaders and human rights groups have condemned the 
practice as collective punishment.
