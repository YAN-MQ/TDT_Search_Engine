The U.N. security council is demanding Yugoslavia observe the October 
12th accord for an end to the crisis in Kosovo. Yesterday, the council 
passed a resolution that endorses the agreement between Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard holbrooke. It calls for 
ground monitoring in Kosovo by unarmed international observers and 
air monitoring by NATO planes. NATO's top generals are also demanding 
that Yugoslav leaders pull out forces from Kosovo or face air strikes 
as early as Tuesday.
