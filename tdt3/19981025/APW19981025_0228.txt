One woman and 21 men were running Sunday for mayor of this crowded 
city of 3 million, plagued by housing problems, pollution and poor 
infrastructure. To win, a candidate needs to secure 50 percent of 
the vote; failing that there will be a second round next week. Turnout 
was expected to be low with many people indicating they have lost 
confidence in the power of authorities to do something for the benefit 
of ordinary people. Polls opened at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) and will close 
at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT). Polling will be extended to midnight if 50 percent 
of the 1.7 million voters, needed to make the election valid, do not 
cast a ballot. ``An enormous amount needs to be done. Bucharest still 
looks untended, mediocre and Balkan,'' said Cornel Nistorescu, director 
of the daily Evenimentul Zilei. Sunday's ballot became necessary when 
Bucharest's last elected mayor Victor Ciorbea became prime minister 
in 1996. He resigned from that job in April, quitting the post of 
mayor at the same time. Despite the absence of reliable opinion polls, 
incumbent mayor Viorel Lis, who was Ciorbea's deputy, is thought to 
have the best chance of winning. His main competitors are Sorin Oprescu, 
head of Bucharest's Municipal Hospital, and Alexandru Sassu, minister 
for relations with parliament.
