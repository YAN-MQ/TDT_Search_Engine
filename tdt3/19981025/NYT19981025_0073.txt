For decades, advertisers and agencies could confidently assume that 
sports would bring them the kinds of consumers they so ardently desired: 
millions of men who usually limited their own athletic pursuits to 
dashing to the store to buy whatever products were sponsoring the 
games played by their favorite teams. But lately, sports coverage 
has been delivering marketers more air balls and fumbles than slam 
dunks and touchdowns. That could cost the media millions of dollars 
later if fading interest requires them to lower their advertising 
rates. Even as fans debated last week whether the 1998 Yankees were 
the best team ever, for example, ratings for the 1998 World Series 
were the worst ever _ below even those for the 1989 Oakland-San Francisco 
series, which was disrupted for 10 days by an earthquake. So far, 
viewership for most National Football League games, through eight 
weeks of the 1998-99 season, is down. Even the venerable ``Monday 
Night Football'' on ABC has seen its ratings slump 9 percent from 
last season. And marketers hoping to reach hoops fans have been left 
dangling by a labor dispute that has canceled the first two weeks 
of National Basketball Association games and threatens the entire 
season. ``Sports as an advertising and marketing vehicle is going 
through a midlife crisis,'' said David Verklin, chief executive at 
Carat North America in New York, a unit of Aegis Group PLC that buys 
time and space for marketers. ``Ad people have so fallen in love with 
sports that they assume no matter what you buy, it will be fantastic,'' 
Verklin added. ``But sports does not have unlimited viewer loyalty, 
unlimited program capacity or unlimited price elasticity.'' Bob Igiel, 
a top executive at the media agency owned by the giant Young &AMP; 
Rubicam Inc., agreed. ``Sports was once impervious, but some of its 
cachet may have disappeared,'' said Igiel, who is executive vice president 
and director for U.S. broadcast at the Media Edge unit of Y&AMP;R 
in New York. ``Sports has held up better than most programming,'' 
he added, ``but it's now suffering some of the same erosion of viewership 
that everything else on television has.'' Igiel described himself 
as especially concerned about the interruption of the NBA season. 
``I'm just throwing my hands up,'' he said, because the viewers lost 
with the disappearance of pro basketball will be ``very tough to replace.'' 
That is particularly true for men ages 18 to 34, a demographic group 
that is watching less prime-time television. Jerry Solomon, president 
for national broadcast and sports marketing at SFM Media in New York, 
a media agency owned by Havas Advertising, said, ``We're not abandoning 
sports, but we may be buying it less.'' To be sure, the agony of defeat 
is not entirely overwhelming the thrill of victory for sports advertisers. 
``I would never say that we're at a point where sports are less attractive,'' 
said John Muszynski, executive director for the national television 
buying group at Starcom Media Services, a unit of Leo Burnett Co. 
in Chicago. ``But sports is no longer sure-fire, guaranteed,'' Muszynski 
said, particularly for advertisers coveting men ages 18 to 24 as well 
as 18 to 34. ``It's a tougher time.'' On the plus side for sports, 
Anheuser-Busch Inc. decided last week to extend its sponsorship of 
Major League Baseball so that Budweiser remained the ``official beer'' 
of the league, the all-star game and the World Series through 2000. 
Though Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of News Corp. owes advertisers an 
estimated $15 million in ``make-good'' commercials because the World 
Series did not go to five games, the network is charging _ and getting 
_ record prices for Super Bowl XXXIII in January. Each 30-second spot 
is going for $1.6 million. And American Football Conference games 
are drawing more viewers this year, when they are being broadcast 
by CBS, than they did last year, when they were on NBC. Some factors 
curbing the appeal of sports may be short-term problems. The football 
season, for example, has so far been marred by mismatches like that 
between the defending Super Bowl-champion Denver Broncos and the Philadelphia 
Eagles on Oct. 4, in which the Broncos drubbed the hapless Eagles, 
41-16. ``Football is going through a cycle where the major-market 
teams are not performing that well,'' said Neal Pilson, president 
at Pilson Communications, a sports television consulting company in 
New York. ``The principal problem the NFL is dealing with is the collapse 
of teams in Chicago, Washington and Philadelphia,'' he said. ``And 
the late-season strength of baseball took a little bite out of football.'' 
The decline in ratings for ``Monday Night Football'' is being attributed 
in part to its time slot this season having changed, to 8 p.m. in 
the East rather than 9 p.m., in the hopes of pulling in a larger audience 
during prime time. Showing football ``when it's 5 o'clock in Los Angeles 
and 7 o'clock in Chicago was a calculated risk,'' Igiel said. And 
the earlier start pits Monday football against wrestling shows on 
cable television that are increasingly popular. Muszynski said, ``I 
don't consider wrestling a sport, but it's definitely a choice for 
young men for entertainment, and it's doing great.'' A problem for 
one sport may even be an opportunity for another. ``With the NBA not 
around, people may pour money into football,'' said Vince Wladika, 
a spokesman for the Fox Sports unit of Fox Broadcasting in New York. 
His network broadcasts National Football Conference games. As Verklin, 
the Carat North America chief, put it, ``Sports is still a desirable 
property'' because ``a sporting event is the final place where Americans 
gather around the television all at one time.'' But the very success 
of sports in the past is a primary reason for its difficulties now, 
Verklin asserted, because the number of sporting events has proliferated 
as a result. ``There's a perception that there's an unlimited capacity 
for anything having to do with sports,'' Verklin said, ``an attitude 
of `If you produce it, they will consume it.' And that's a mistake.'' 
The seasons for traditional sports are longer. The pre- and postgame 
shows on television are longer. Other sports, like auto racing, are 
adding more events. And activities ranging from women's basketball 
and the coming Women's World Cup soccer tournament to the so-called 
extreme sports offer new games to cover. Some old-time sports are 
even making comebacks; the Nashville Network cable channel owned by 
CBS Corp. is reviving roller derby in January with a weekly two-hour 
``Roller Jam'' series. ``There's a trend toward a sports glut,'' said 
Ron Fredrick, executive director for the national broadcast group 
at J. Walter Thompson USA in New York, an agency owned by WPP Group 
PLC. ``We may have to get used to similar ratings numbers in the sports 
area that we have been getting used to in prime time,'' he added, 
referring to the declining viewership of entertainment fare as choices 
multiply. Igiel of the Media Edge gave another reason for the blows 
to the hegemony of sports. ``There are now lots of other activities 
going on in people's lives,'' he said, from using computers to playing 
video games to even participating in sports rather than passively 
watching them. As a result, Solomon of SFM Media predicted further 
erosion of interest in sports. ``I was weaned on sports, but young 
people have other things to do,'' he said. ``So sports will continue 
to decline as they grow up without being committed sports fans.'' 
Another theory involves the transformation of sports into big business. 
Upheavals in the pro leagues range from higher salaries and labor 
unrest to abrupt franchise moves and free agency's weakening of the 
ties between fans and players. ``Fans are fed up,'' said Jeffrey Steinhour, 
vice president and account service director at Crispin Porter &AMP; 
Bogusky, a Miami ad agency. ``We need to get back to the roots of 
what motivates athletes, back to the authenticity of the game.'' Crispin 
Porter is creating a $4 million campaign for the And 1 brand of basketball 
shoes that will proceed despite the forced timeout in NBA play. The 
ads will be focused on ``the basketball fan and player at the core 
of the sport,'' said Steinhour, who said he was unswayed by ``the 
endorsement deals, the hype, the marketing.'' Of course, the increased 
fees that networks must pay for rights to broadcast games are a factor, 
too. The costs are typically passed on to advertisers in the form 
of higher prices for commercials. That leads their agencies to search 
for alternate ways to garner audiences and ratings. ``If we're not 
going to get 15s anymore,'' said Fredrick of Thompson USA, referring 
to a rating indicating that 15 percent of all television sets are 
tuned to a certain program, ``we can buy three 5's or four 4's.'' 
``I long for the days of three choices,'' he added. ``Now there are 
a hundred.'' Solomon, the SFM Media executive, who is a former president 
of Busch Media, the in-house media arm of Anheuser-Busch, echoed Fredrick. 
``We've gone to much more cable TV this year than we have ever gone 
to before,'' he said. Among the networks on which he is buying more 
commercial time are those ``that deliver high numbers of men,'' he 
added, like the History Channel and the Discovery Channel. ``Our job 
used to be easy and glamorous,'' Solomon said with a chuckle. ``Now 
it's work.''
