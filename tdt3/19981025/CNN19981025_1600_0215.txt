Some lawmakers aren't sure about the CIA's role in the Middle East 
peace process. A Senate committee will hold a hearing on the agreement 
to have the intelligence agency monitor Palestinian anti-terrorist 
efforts. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright says such work is nothing

committee on intelligence says he's troubled that the agency's role 
will be so visible.
