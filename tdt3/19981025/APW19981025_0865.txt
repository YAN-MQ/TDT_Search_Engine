Guinea-Bissau rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane, who staged a military 
coup five months ago, has agreed to talks with the president of the 
tiny west African country over ending renewed fighting, news reports 
said Sunday. The agreement came after talks between Mane and visiting 
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, the Portuguese news agency 
Lusa said. Gama met with Mane late Saturday and also held talks with 
President Joao Bernardo Vieira. Officials cited by Lusa said the meeting 
might take place this week. Vieira proposed talks with Mane last Wednesday 
when he announced a government cease-fire after fighting had erupted 
four days earlier. The rebels responded Friday with a 48-hour truce, 
demanding that Vieira schedule new talks and explain the presence 
of foreign troops in the former Portuguese colony. Some 3,000 heavily 
armed soldiers from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea have been in 
Guinea-Bissau to back Vieira since the conflict began in early June. 
Senegalese Interior Minister Lamine Sisse also talked to both leaders 
Saturday and gave them a message from Senegal's President Abdou Diouf, 
details of which were not disclosed, Lusa reported. Fighting in the 
impoverished country restarted last Sunday when Mane's rebels advanced 
on the center of Bissau, toward the presidential palace. While troops 
loyal to Vieira secured the capital's downtown, the rebels gained 
ground inland, overrunning the country's second and third largest 
towns, Bafata and Gabu. A truce had been in place since July 26 and 
was reaffirmed a month later, under mediation by west African and 
Portuguese-speaking countries. Mane led a military rebellion June 
7, a day after Vieira dismissed him as Armed Forces chief for allegedly 
arming separatists in Senegal. About half of the country's population 
of 1 million has been displaced since the fighting began.
