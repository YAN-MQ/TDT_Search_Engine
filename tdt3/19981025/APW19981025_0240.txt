Russian President Boris Yeltsin will meet with international lenders, 
sign economic agreements, and discuss NATO expansion during a one-day 
visit to Austria this week. Yeltsin, dogged by health problems that 
forced him to cancel a visit to Malaysia later this year, will meet 
with Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, the present holder of the rotating 
European Union chairmanship. The two are expected to discuss security 
issues, including the recent Middle East peace agreement and the crackdown 
on ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo Province. The 67-year-old 
Yeltsin's trip had originally been announced as a two-day visit. His 
latest illness, described as a respiratory infection, forced him to 
cut short a visit to Central Asia last week, and he has spent much 
of his time since then in country residences. Accompanied by high 
level officials, among them Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Finance 
Minister Mikhail Zadornov, Yeltsin will also meet with International 
Monetary Fund and World Bank officials to debate economic assistance 
to Russia. So far the IMF has been reluctant to release the next part 
of a 22.6 billion dollar loan package created for Russia earlier this 
summer. Russian delegates will sign a number of economic agreements 
that should bring dlrs 600 million in direct investment to Russia, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The agreements include joint venture 
contracts, a program to train Russian managers abroad and create ecologically 
safe sewage systems in one Russian city. Yeltsin has been weakened 
by recurring health problems in recent years, including heart bypass 
surgery in 1996. He has kept an increasingly low political profile, 
going to the Kremlin two or three days a week. The president and his 
doctors insist that Yeltsin will serve out the less than two years 
that remain of his term, and they deny that he has serious health 
problems.
