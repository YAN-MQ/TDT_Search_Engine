If you were writing an updated version of ``Profiles in Courage,'' 
you would probably not plan especially long chapters on either Sen. 
Alfonse D'Amato or Rep. Charles Schumer. But during their race for 
the Senate, besides calling each other names, they have presented 
New Yorkers with one shining moment of heroism. It appears in one 
of D'Amato's many television commercials excoriating Schumer. The 
ad is titled ``Voted Against the Ice Storm,'' which can be confusing 
at first because it sounds as if Congress has taken to voting on the 
weather. You start wondering if these votes are taken retrospectively 
(``Senate Censures Last Week's Heat Wave'') or represent a new form 
of proactive government (``In Compromise, House Votes for Partly Cloudy 
Skies Tomorrow''). But the fight, as usual, turns out to be about 
money: a bill passed in Congress giving more than $25 million to upstate 
New York farms and businesses that were hurt by an ice storm in January. 
While D'Amato voted in favor of the aid, the commercial explains, 
Schumer voted against it. ``Chuck Schumer votes for foreign aid for 
countries like Mongolia,'' the outraged announcer declares over an 
image of camels crossing a frozen tundra, ``but votes against upstate 
New York.'' Schumer has tried to excuse his action. He told reporters 
that he voted against the bill only because it also cut money for 
housing programs, and over the weekend his campaign broadcast ads 
declaring his support for upstate disaster relief. But there's no 
need for him to make excuses. He should be proud of his heroism. His 
vote gives hope to taxpayers everywhere, especially those living in 
downstate New York. It raises the first interesting question of the 
campaign: Why do those upstate dairy farmers deserve our money any 
more than Mongolian nomads do? The ostensible reason is that we have 
an obligation to fellow citizens rendered helpless by a natural disaster 
beyond their control. But why were these upstaters so unprepared for 
an ice storm? The North Country's hardy souls are said to be guided 
by traditional virtues and the timeless rhythms of nature. At some 
point in their lives they must have noticed that, come January in 
the Adirondacks, water has a tendency to freeze. True, January's storm 
was exceptionally severe, and the victims obviously deserve sympathy 
for their losses. But severe storms were a known risk of doing business 
in the Snow Belt, just as market turbulence was a known risk for the 
brokers and secretaries on Wall Street who have recently lost their 
jobs _ and aren't getting any federal aid. As business risks go, bad 
weather is relatively simple to prepare for with insurance and other 
precautions. For some reason, though, Americans are no longer expected 
to prepare for acts of nature. Why should New York's dairy farmers 
plan for storms when most Californians refuse to buy earthquake insurance, 
Midwesterners continue building businesses in flood plains, and Floridians 
erect expensive homes on shores that are regularly battered by hurricanes? 
They have all learned that if anything goes wrong, politicians will 
race to the scene with promises of money. ``Disaster aid has become 
one of the great tools for buying votes and photo opportunities,'' 
said James Bovard, an adjunct analyst with the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute who has tracked a sharp increase in spending over the past 
decade. ``Since he took office, President Clinton has set records 
by declaring disasters at the rate of nearly one per week. The federal 
government has wasted billions of dollars infantilizing Americans 
and given them all the wrong incentives.'' For decades Americans have 
regarded New York City residents as deadbeats _ a bunch of improvident 
grasshoppers begging for help from the heartland's conscientious ants. 
Americans delighted turning us down in our hour of need two decades 
ago, when The Daily News ran its famous headline ``FORD TO CITY: DROP 
DEAD.'' But we're the ones with the foresight to live by one of the 
world's most sheltered harbors, high above the waterline. Our houses 
are not regularly endangered by mudslides, brush fires, or tornadoes; 
our high-rises are anchored in bedrock that doesn't routinely quake. 
Congested urban living poses its own risks _ fires, ruptured water 
mains, collapsing buildings, burglaries _ but we buy insurance or 
absorb the losses ourselves. So when those improvident upstaters come 
begging, we have the right to politely demur: CITY TO STICKS: ICE 
HAPPENS.
