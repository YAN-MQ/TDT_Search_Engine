U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright warned today that Yugoslavia's 
President Slobodan Milosevic has still not lived up to his agreement 
to pull his troops out of the province of Kosovo. He has until Tuesday. 
ABC's Richard Gizbert is in Kosovo. In Kosovo, burying the dead can 
cost you your life. These Albanians were digging a grave this morning 
when repeated gunfire forced them to take cover. "The Serbs are shooting 
from the same place as yesterday," he says. Yesterday, the shots killed 
an 11-year-old Albanian boy. His family says he died while chopping 
wood. Today, the boy's mother fainted as they carried him to be buried. 
"I can't understand," one of his relatives said, "how the world can 
allow our children to be massacred in front of our eyes." Back in 
Belgrade, NATO military commanders met once again with Yugoslav President 
Milosevic, pressing him to meet the latest NATO deadline by withdrawing 
most of his troops from Kosovo by Tuesday. Although some Serb tanks 
have pulled out this weekend, NATO now concedes the Serbs will likely 
fall short of full compliance on Tuesday. And the threat of air strikes 
will likely be extended. And that's why on Tuesday, when we review 
this, we may come to the conclusion that we cannot yet relax our guard. 
We cannot stand the planes down. But if NAto allows Tuesday's deadline 
to slip, it would be the second time in two weeks the alliance has 
given President Milosevic more time. And for Kosovo's ethnic Albanians 
who marked another grave today, that time can be measured in lives 
lost. Richard Gizbert, ABC News, Pristina.
