Declaring that he is troubled by the CIA's role in a new Middle East 
peace accord, Sen. Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Select Committee 
on Intelligence, said Sunday that he would hold hearings to investigate 
the matter. Shelby, R-Ala., said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that he did 
not think he could stop the agency from taking on its new role mediating 
between Israel and the Palestinians. But he said that he wanted to 
find out a great deal more about it from the director of central intelligence, 
George Tenet. ``I think it is troubling, troubling to me, troubling 
to a lot of people that have overseen and worked with the CIA and 
its mission over the years,'' Shelby said. In the new accord, the 
traditional role of the CIA is being expanded ``out into the open,'' 
he said. ``The CIA would be the implementer of policy here, which 
is a big departure, and I think it's something we have to look into.'' 
He said he had no difficulty with the CIA working quietly, ``in the 
background,'' to insure that the Israelis and Palestinians share information. 
Under the peace deal worked out on Friday morning after 18 months 
of drafting and nine days of negotiation, the CIA station chief in 
Israel will sit on a committee with the Israeli and Palestinian security 
directors. He is to promote Israeli and Palestinian security cooperation 
and handle complaints from both sides. But the agency is also supposed 
to be a sort of ``validator'' of Palestinian efforts to fight terrorism, 
both on its own and with the Israelis. Many of those efforts are laid 
out in the agreement, with timetables. For instance, the CIA will 
validate whether the Palestinian Authority is working hard to confiscate 
illegal weapons and is reducing the size of its police force from 
more than 40,000 to the 30,000 called for in earlier accords. In addition, 
the CIA will insure that at least 30 Palestinians wanted by the Israelis 
for terrorism will be incarcerated by the Palestinian Authority and 
are not simply arrested and let go again, in what the Israelis call 
``a revolving door.'' The CIA is already assisting Israel with sophisticated 
border-control devices, with more to come, to allow Palestinians and 
their goods to travel in and out of Israel with fewer security delays 
for inspections, usually in an effort to find explosives or weapons. 
And it is also helping to train the Palestinian security forces. The 
new role ``will put people in danger,'' Shelby said. ``This is a real 
departure of the traditional role of the CIA,'' which is to gather 
intelligence, he continued, ``and I would hope that they stay within 
their role, and they would not be something _ border guards, arbitrators, 
enforcers of a policy.'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said 
the CIA was already engaged in similar work, especially in the Middle 
East. ``The CIA has played roles previously in terms of monitoring 
and verifying other agreements previously in the region,'' Ms. Albright 
said on the CBS news program ``Face the Nation.'' She added that the 
agency's new role began with an anti-terrorism summit meeting at Sharm 
el-Sheik, Egypt, in 1996, just before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu was elected. The agency would work in a ``role which assists, 
to try to deal with these issues without being personally involved,'' 
Ms. Albright said. ``We're there, as we are in the peace talks, always 
as the honest broker as assisting in this.'' She said Tenet intended 
to explain the issues to Congress in any event, and other officials 
noted that the agency maintains offices in the West Bank cities of 
Hebron, Ramallah and Nablus as well as one in the Gaza Strip. But 
other senior U.S. and Israeli officials said the CIA role could also 
be controversial for different reasons. The agreement for Israel to 
hand over another 13 percent of the West Bank in return for Palestinian 
steps on security is carried out in three stages over three months. 
Israel would have the right to suspend the agreement _ and the transfer 
of large amounts of land to the Palestinians _ if it is judged that 
the Palestinians are not living up to their specific security commitments. 
And it will be the CIA that will arbitrate that judgment, which would 
have major political and security ramifications throughout the Middle 
East. Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, emphasized that 
the agency ``is not enforcing the provisions'' of the accord. ``The 
CIA will help to facilitate cooperation,'' he said on the ABC news 
program ``This Week.'' ``They'll play an observer role to determine 
whether the overall agreement security provisions are being implemented. 
That gives both sides a greater degree of confidence.'' Bergeralso 
said the CIA role was not that new, and that the agency also played 
``a verifying and mediating role'' in the 1973 Sinai disengagement 
agreement, and continues to do so there and on the Golan Heights between 
Syria and Israel. Netanyahu, speaking on CNN, said the idea of the 
CIA playing this role was an American one, which he accepted. He said 
that Israel had a sufficient intelligence capacity, so needed the 
CIA's information less than it did the CIA's honesty in judging Palestinian 
efforts. ``I think what we have to do is to be honest about things, 
and to monitor things as they are, if there are violations, to confront 
them, not to look aside, because lives are at stake,'' he said. ``The 
security of Israel is at stake.''
