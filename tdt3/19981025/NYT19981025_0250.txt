As David Reid and James ``Cowboy'' Coker waltzed into the wee hours 
Sunday morning at Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J., it looked 
as if both had two left feet. But that's what happens when Fred Astaire 
goes toe to toe with Hopalong Cassidy. In the end it was a very dissatisfying 
12-round dance for both Reid, the slick puncher from Philadelphia, 
and Coker, the cowpuncher from San Antonio. Coker's southpaw style 
proved so awkward that Reid was never able to unleash his devastating 
right hand. And though Coker (20-1) was credited with two knockdowns, 
the judges ignored them in the scoring. Reid (11-0) looked bad, but 
he was never in serious trouble, and he scored a 12-round unanimous 
decision and took away Coker's World Boxing Council Continental Americas 
superwelterweight title. ``He was very awkward,'' Reid said. ``He 
leaned over to his left so just in case I threw the right hand, he 
could slip it. He would stay in a position to smother all my punches. 
I couldn't throw any punches inside. I just had to throw from the 
outside so I could score. I had to take what I could get.'' The judges 
gave Reid almost every round: Paul Venti scored it 117-111, Ron Greenley 
scored it 118-110 and John Poturely scored it 119-111, all for Reid. 
Coker won the third round on all the score cards. Poturely scored 
the 11th and 12th, when Coker put Reid on the canvas in both rounds, 
even. Coker's left hand to Reid's temple in the 12th round appeared 
to register a clear knockdown, but Greenley scored the round for Reid. 
``I don't know what you have to do short of killing the guy,'' Coker 
said. ``I knew I would really have to beat him to win. How can you 
score a fight like that when you have two or three knockdowns?'' Reid 
got two new experiences from this fight. He received his first cut 
_ a nasty gash over his right eye in the third round that required 
six stitches outside and four inside. And he was knocked down twice. 
Coker, 32, heads back to San Antonio to regroup, while the 25-year-old 
Reid, the only American boxer to win a gold medal in the 1996 Olympic 
Games in Atlanta, continues his rise toward a world championship. 
Although his performance wasn't very slick, by his own admission and 
that of his trainer, Al Mitchell, Reid should be in line for a title 
shot by next spring. Keith Mullings, the World Boxing Council superwelterweight 
champion, was at ringside Saturday night. Reid, who entered the bout 
against Coker ranked No. 3 in the WBC, has his sights set on Mullings' 
title. In the only world championship bout on the card, Robert Garcia 
(31-0) retained his International Boxing Federation junior lightweight 
championship by stopping Ramon Ledon (12-1-1) at 1 minute 9 seconds 
of the eighth round. Garcia rallied after being wobbled by Ledon in 
the second round, getting a severe cut over his right eye and one 
in his scalp. In the fight preceding the main event, John Brown (19-5) 
stopped Gabriel Ruelas (45-5) at 58 seconds of the fifth round. Ruelas, 
a former world lightweight champion, looked lethargic and could not 
mount any offense. He absorbed a great deal of punishment from Brown. 
Dan Goosen, Ruelas' longtime promoter, said he would talk to the 28-year-old 
Ruelas about retiring.
