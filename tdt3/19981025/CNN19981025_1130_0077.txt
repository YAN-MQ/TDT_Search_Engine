Netanyahu is back in Israel. He arrived in Tel Aviv today amid tight 
security. Netanyahu is expressing confidence his government will make 
it through this difficult time. Some Israeli politicians from most 
parties are predicting political turmoil following the signing of 
the deal. Netanyahu explains, the decision to hand over more land 
to the Palestinians was a tough one. We had to give up land. This 
is very painful. It is difficult for everyone for the defense minister 
and for every one of us. Every mountain, every valley, every hill 
is a part of our history, of our people, and speak to us in great 
strength. And to hand over even a centimeter of the land of Israel 
to the Palestinian authority is very, very difficult. Netanyahu says 
he's grateful to President Clinton for his role in helping to negotiate 
the peace deal.
