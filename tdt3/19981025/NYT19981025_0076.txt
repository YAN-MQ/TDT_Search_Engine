It is safe to say that the mood of the conference sponsored by the 
Magazine Publishers of America in Orlando, Fla., last week was one 
of caution. Most of the 800 publishers, editors, subscription agents, 
advertising directors and investment bankers who gathered at the conference 
expressed trepidation about the potential for sluggish advertising 
sales in 1999; they were concerned about the European and Asian economies 
and how the downturn of those economies will affect marketers' budgets; 
they sweated over newsstand consolidation, which is making distribution 
more difficult. ``People are generally feeling scared to pessimistic 
about next year,'' said Michael Lafavore, the editor in chief of Men's 
Health, which is published by Rodale Press. But it was hard to be 
too gloomy in a world where most people wear mouse ears and there's 
a 60-foot-high plaster swan perched atop the neighboring hotel. Disney 
World, the Walt Disney Co. flagship where the conference was held, 
does not provide the most serious environment for thought-provoking, 
chin-in-hand discourse. So while Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, 
spoke gravely about the economy (``the global economy is rooted in 
deep political imbalances,'' was one phrase), some found it difficult 
to regard him as soberly as they would have had he been speaking from 
a U.N. podium. He was, after all, at the Disney Yacht and Beach Resort, 
and remember, this is central Florida _ with no places to anchor a 
genuine yacht and no beaches, save for the Disney-manufactured ones, 
upon which to sun. Attendees could watch Steven Brill, the editor 
of Brill's Content, and Norman Pearlstine, editor-in-chief of Time 
Inc., debate the issues raised by the CNN Tailwind controversy, typical 
enough fare for a magazine convention. But this conference also featured 
a unique combination: the chance to speculate about the economy, and 
the chance to watch an animated cartoon in a screening room in the 
base of an enormous, fake baobab tree at Animal Kingdom. While Michael 
Clinton, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Hearst 
Magazines, shared his concerns with other publishers on a panel, he 
also got to ride Space Mountain for the first time. Clinton said that 
1997 and 1998 were such stellar years for the magazine industry that 
it was natural for publishers to wonder how long the good times would 
last, especially after the recent fluctuations in the stock market. 
It has been a good decade, over all. In 1997, magazine advertisers 
spent more than $12.7 billion in the publications tracked by the Publishers 
Information Bureau; in 1990, they spent only $6.7 billion. In 1997, 
magazine advertising pages topped 231,000, according to the Publishers 
Information Bureau _ up 35 percent from 1990. ``We are all asking 
ourselves, `How high is high?''' Clinton said. ``So as we look around 
at all the global markets, it keeps us very concerned about next year. 
Certainly, I think that the market in the last week or two has been 
encouraging.'' The real tell-tale sign will be retail sales this Christmas 
season, he said, ``because that's a great barometer of consumer confidence, 
and when consumers are spending, marketers will feel more comfortable 
about increasing their spending.'' Lafavore expressed concern about 
the 12 international editions of his magazine. ``I used to worry about 
only one economy,'' he said. ``Now I have to worry about a whole bunch 
of them. Certainly, in Russia we launched less than a year ago and 
we came in late to a booming market.'' Lafavore said that he was also 
concerned about the editions his company publishes in Peru, Colombia 
and Mexico. ``And we were talking about starting up in Brazil, but 
things have taken a turn for the worse there,'' he said. William Reilly, 
chairman and chief executive of Primedia, which is controlled by Kohlberg 
Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., the buyout firm, shocked some guests by 
saying in the conference's closing speech that he welcomed a recession 
because it might allow him to snatch up some new properties. Reed 
Phillips III, an investment banker with Da Silva &AMP; Phillips, suggested 
another benefit of downturns. ``A recession tends to lead to a shake-out,'' 
he said. ``There are probably too many magazines, and after a recession 
you would have fewer magazines. In some markets, you might have eight 
competitors where you should only have four or five.'' When those 
extra magazines close, he said, they stop diluting the ad market for 
the survivors. Perhaps Michael Kelly, the editor of National Journal, 
summed up the conference's surreality most eloquently, if half-jokingly. 
Kelly said that holding the publishers' conference at Disney World 
was ``akin to that sensation you get when you're standing at the edge 
of a vast ocean, and people always say that kind of moment puts your 
life in perspective. You realize you're one small mortal.'' ``There's 
a Disney effect like that,'' he continued. ``All these people are 
going to panels and earnestly discussing the magazine industry and 
brilliant launches and how to conduct research, but at the same time 
you're surrounded by this endless Disney world that goes on forever 
all around you. And you begin to get this feeling. What does all of 
this matter? In five years, Disney will just own us anyway. We'll 
all just be another subsidiary.''
