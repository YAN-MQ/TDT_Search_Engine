Hundreds of thousands of people on Sunday kicked off a week-long celebration 
to mark the 75th anniversary of the republic, marching through streets 
across the country and shouting slogans in favor of secular Turkey. 
``Turkey is secular and will remain so,'' and ``Long live the republic,'' 
a stream of flag-waiving crowds chanted in the capital Ankara as they 
marched some 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) to the Mausoleum of Mustafa 
Kemal Ataturk, the founder of secular Turkey. The marchers laid flags 
and flowers as they filed past Ataturk's marble resting place. In 
Istanbul, hundreds of thousands more who gathered in the central Taksim 
square chanted the national anthem and songs from the early days of 
the republic. Similar rallies took place all across Turkey where a 
widening divide between those determined to preserve Turkey's secular 
tradition and supporters of an Islamic political movement has been 
a constant source of tension for the country in the past two years. 
An Islamic-led government was pressured into resignation last year 
by the fiercely pro-secular military and the Islamic Welfare party 
was disbanded by the Constitutional court for anti-secular activity 
this year. Sunday's marches, the largest gathering of people in the 
country, managed to dwarf a protest march earlier this month by thousands 
of Muslims demonstrators who joined hands and marched throughout Turkey 
to protest a ban on Islamic-style head scarves in schools and public 
offices. Ataturk founded the secular republic on 29 October 1923 after 
the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, curtailing religion's place in 
society by making secularism a deeply ingrained ideology. Celebrations 
will continue throughout the week across the country with a series 
of cultural events and festivities. Several heads of states and governments 
are expected to arrive in Ankara Wednesday to attend an official republic 
day ceremony.
