Student discontent, retiree rage, stubborn unemployment, and transit 
strikes sparked by youth violence are finally taking their toll on 
the once-lofty approval ratings of France's leaders. A poll published 
Sunday indicates a sharp ratings drop for both conservative President 
Jacques Chirac and Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. Another 
survey said Jospin's education minister has not done enough to improve 
aging and overcrowded high schools, whose students plan to protest 
nationwide again next month. ``Chirac-Jospin: the fall'' headlined 
the Journal de Dimanche in reporting Chirac's rating in October dropped 
six points to 56 percent. Jospin, whose ratings once topped 70 percent 
since he took office in June last year, got a 54 percent approval 
rating, down seven points, according to the IFOP agency poll. Both 
leaders had profited from France's summer World Cup soccer victory 
and from economic growth. But unemployment leveled off at 11.8 percent 
and the French stock market suffered from the world financial crisis. 
Hundreds of thousands of students demonstrated in recent weeks for 
more school aid and transit workers staged crippling strikes to demand 
more police to fight rising youth violence. Tens of thousands of retirees 
marched last week against plans to control rising state pension costs. 
The government, meanwhile, is trying to keep the deficit within 3 
percent of the gross domestic product, required by the euro single 
currency effective next year. The Chirac-Jospin poll, conducted Oct. 
15-23, surveyed a nationally representative sampling of 1,850 adults. 
No margin of error was given, but such French polls usually carry 
an error margin of plus or minus 2-3 percent. Another survey said 
55 percent of the French believe Education Minister Claude Allegre 
last week failed to adequately answer demands by students, who plan 
another nationwide protest Nov. 5. The disapproval widened to 63 percent 
among the 15-24 age group, according to the poll, also conducted by 
IFOP for the Journal de Dimanche. That poll, conducted after Allegre 
announced the new measures Wednesday, surveyed 1,002 people, a nationally 
representative group age 15 and above, with a margin of error of 2-3 
percent. Allegre said he will hire 15,000 more personnel, cut class 
sizes to 35 by next fall, boost security and make 4 billion francs 
(dlrs 730 million) in no-interest loans for regions to rebuild their 
schools. ``I'm hiring more professors,'' he argued on Canal Plus TV 
Sunday. But he also sympathized with the students. ``I think I would 
have protested, too.'' Students demand the government still more teachers, 
buy more classroom equipment like computers and reform curricula to 
better prepare them for the job market.
