Teaching table manners to the silicone valley crowd. Can you turn 
Bill Gates into a Cary grant? Two women in California's silicone valley 
are trying. Here's ABC's Lisa Salters. First of all, you don't butter 
the whole thing, and you don't butter it in midair. It's a crash course 
in etiquette for computer geeks. And, gentlemen, we don't tuck it 
in our ties, no matter what. High-tech workers in California's silicone 
valley may be masters of the mainframe. You don't conduct an orchestra 
when you've got these things in your hand. But put most of them in 
a fancy restaurant with a big business deal on the line -- If they 
sat down at a table and they had four forks on one side, they'd be 
lost. That's why an unusual etiquette training course, called the 
workshoppe, has become so trendy here in silicone valley, where simply 
being a computer wiz is no longer good enough. There's a lot of bright 
people out there. You have to show that you have more than that. You 
cut and you bite. The workshoppe was founded three years ago by two 
businesswomen. And there's already a two-month waiting list of companies 
ready to log on. We hear horror stories about people dealing with 
large companies here, and the CEO will lean over and take a bite out 
of somebody else's dessert. You just don't do things like that. You 
also don't talk with your mouth full or rest your silverware on the 
table, all rules your mom probably taught you, rules that many computer 
geniuses seem to have forgotten. I learned how to park my silverware. 
This is something that had escaped me. The course teaches everything 
from how to set a formal table to how to pick an appropriate wine. 
A lot to download, perhaps, but it's information that could make or 
break a Deal when wining and dining an important client. We're making 
you more polished, more sophisticated. These things are important 
for your career. After all, even in cyberworld, presentation is everything. 
And then you put your glass down again. Lisa Salters, ABC News, San 
Jose, California.
