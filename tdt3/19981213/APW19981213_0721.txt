With the dust just settling over a suggestion by German Foreign Minister 
Joschka Fischer that NATO rethink its first-strike nuclear policy, 
a remark by the country's defense minister released Sunday raised 
the prospect of a possible new dispute over NATO strategy. In an interview 
to be published in the Monday edition of the Berliner Zeitung, Defense 
Minister Rudolf Scharping was quoted as saying he ``discounted'' NATO 
intervening in regions distant from Europe. The report quoted Scharping 
as saying that ``here and there such considerations may exist. But 
the strategy of the alliance will be decided in consensus.'' U.S. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at a NATO meeting in Brussels 
last Tuesday that the alliance must be prepared to take action beyond 
its borders, while rejecting concerns that this would create a new 
global NATO as ``hogwash.'' Albright pointed to Bosnia and Kosovo 
as outside NATO regions were the alliance has already adapted to a 
new strategic environment to prevent unrest from spreading. NATO defense 
ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels again starting Wednesday, 
and Sharping's comments could renew frowns over Germany's new center-left 
coalition, now that Fischer was forced to admit his suggestion got 
nowhere. Fischer got some diplomatic forgiveness from NATO Secretary 
General Javier Solana, who was quoted by a newspaper Sunday as saying 
he saw no dispute with the German defense minister. In an interview 
with the Hamburg-based Welt am Sonntag, Solana was quoted as saying 
he had understanding for Fischer and that it was legitimate to question 
NATO strategy. He also said Fischer's contribution to last week's 
NATO meeting was ``definitely constructive.'' At the same time, Solana 
told the newspaper atomic weapons remained important as a deterrence 
against a mass-destruction weapons threat and that the Germans were 
well aware of that. Fischer, an environmentalist Green and 1980s anti-nuclear 
activist, drew tough criticism from opposition politicians in Germany 
when he suggested last month that NATO would help defuse tensions 
in the world by getting rid of what he called an outmoded first-strike 
nuclear strategy. The strategy was originally developed to prevent 
Warsaw Pact forces from invading western Europe, a threat which no 
longer exists. At the same time Fischer said he didn't expect to find 
consensus for his suggestion, but just wanted to jog NATO planners 
into updating their strategy. NATO's three nuclear powers, the United 
States, Britain and France were among those rejecting Fischer's suggestion.
