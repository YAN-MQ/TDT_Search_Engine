The house is scheduled to take up the articles of impeachment Thursday. 
Members who have declared how they will vote fall mostly within party 
lines. But of the estimated 30 or so that haven't declared how they 
will vote, the White House would need to convince about 20, including 
at least nine undecided republicans. Some are withholding judgment 
for a while longer. I received a threat from the White House. There 
are things coming from all type of angles. There's no help. I'm not 
getting anything that I can sink my teeth into and I can go. I am 
trying to reach that.
