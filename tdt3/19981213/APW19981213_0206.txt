Chechnya has accused a renegade warlord in the breakaway republic 
of kidnapping and brutally murdering four foreigners whose heads were 
found by a roadside last week, a news report said on Sunday. Appearing 
on state television, Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev claimed 
Saturday that rebel warlord Arbi Barayev masterminded the kidnapping 
and killing of three Britons and a New Zealander who were in Chechnya 
to install a cellular phone system, according to the ITAR-Tass news 
agency. The four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi 
of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were captured Oct. 3. 
Their decapitated heads were found at a roadside on Tuesday, and officials 
speculate they were killed after a botched rescue attempt. Chechen 
police have suggested before that Barayev, the head of a group called 
the Islamic Regiment, is connected with a wave of kidnappings that 
has washed over Chechnya since the end of its 1994-96 independence 
war with Russia. The claims have never been proven. Atgeriyev also 
said Barayev had kidnapped Chechnya's general prosecutor, Mansur Tagirov, 
on Thursday. Tagirov, who was investigating the deaths of the four 
foreigners, was released Saturday. Atgeriyev's claims came at the 
same time as Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov ordered a partial call-up 
of army reserves on Saturday night in an effort to fight crime in 
the region. Also Saturday, Russian security forces freed a kidnapped 
Frenchman working for the U.N. refugee agency in neighboring Ingushetia 
after more than 10 months in captivity. Since Chechnya's independence 
war with Russia ended, the Caucasus region has been hit by violence 
as feuding gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been 
kidnapped, mostly for ransom.
