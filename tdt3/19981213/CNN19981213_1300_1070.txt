The NFL playoff picture may be coming into focus today. Details next, 
in "CNN Headline Sports." Wahoo! ha ha--uh-oh. Ahhhh! Oomph! Now we'll 
never get presents to all the boys and girls around the world. No 
toys? Sorry. Folks need a hand? Nice hat. You saved Christmas. Glad 
I could help. bye! So long! bye! Hey, can I drive? Season's Greetings 
from UPS. I'm a music major. It's tough. I mean, you go away from 
home, and I really wanted to do well. So what I really needed... was 
a big-screen notebook with dvd. But I couldn't find the right one. 
My roommate told me that I could get Dell on the Internet. Dell built 
a notebook just for me. I got right online and found answers... to 
a million questions at some pretty weird hours. They're making me 
look way too smart. Dell computers use Intel Pentium II processors. 
With "CNN Headline Sports," I'm Russell Biven.
