An Iranian writer missing since last week has been found dead, his 
daughter said. He is the fifth critic of the hard-line clerical regime 
to die in mysterious circumstances in recent weeks. Iran's judiciary, 
controlled by the hard-liners, blamed unnamed foreigners for the killings 
while a group of lawmakers accused an exiled Iranian opposition organization. 
The latest victim is Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old writer 
and translator, who had been missing since last Wednesday. His body 
was found Thursday, apparently strangled, Pouyandeh's daughter, 17-year-old 
Nazanin, said Sunday. No personal belongings were missing, she said. 
Iran's deputy interior minister, Mostafa Tajzadeh, said the killings 
are aimed at tarnishing the image of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, 
who is locked in a power struggle with conservative clergymen opposed 
to his political and social reforms. Khatami's efforts had emboldened 
many free-thinkers in Iran such as Pouyandeh. But that has also angered 
the hard-liners, who control nearly all key institutions, including 
the security forces, the intelligence network and the office of the 
supreme leader, who has the last say on all matters. The president 
of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, Massoud Rajavi, condemned 
Pouyandeh's death. ``The recent events once again prove that Khatami's 
claims about 'the rule of law' and civil society' are only a deception,'' 
Rajavi said in a news release faxed from the group's office in Washington. 
The daily Akhbar newspaper quoted Tajzadeh as saying that a number 
of arrests had been made and ``some clues'' have been found. He said 
a special committee is investigating. He did not elaborate. He described 
the killings as a conspiracy to make ``things bitter for the people, 
at a time that the system is moving toward political development.'' 
Pouyandeh's daughter said the family identified his body late Saturday 
after being notified by the police. ``I have lost all hope. I don't 
know who will die next, but I hope that my father was the last victim 
of these slayings,'' she told The Associated Press. Ali Abbasi-Fard, 
the spokesman of Iran's judiciary, said Sunday it appears that a ``sinister 
and organized movement is using agents affiliated to foreign elements 
to undermine social stability and to create fear throughout the society.'' 
In a joint letter to Khatami, 140 of Iran's 270 Parliament members 
accused the Iraq-based opposition Mujahedeen Khalq and unspecified 
foreign intelligence services of carrying out the killings. ``Those 
masterminding such conspiracies are trying to suggest that insecurity 
is prevailing in Iran,'' the letter said. In the past three weeks, 
four other government critics, including two writers, have been found 
dead. One of them, Mohammad Mokhtari, was possibly strangled, according 
to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Majid Sharif, another writer 
also went missing and was found dead. The head of an Iranian opposition 
group, Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found stabbed 
to death in their home last month. Over the past year, the hard-liners 
have resorted to increasing violence to deal with pro-Khatami opponents. 
Nobody has been charged in any of the attacks.
