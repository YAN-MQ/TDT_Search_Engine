Elephant Polo may not be the fastest or most graceful sport ever played, 
but participants say there's nothing else like it. Anita Pratap shows 
us why. For tourists who come to Nepal to see the Himalayas or wildlife 
sanctuaries, playing or watching elephant Polo is a unique opportunity. 
The game is interesting to watch. It seems to be a lot of fun. It's 
serious on the field, because you want to win. But the elephants won't 
let you take it too seriously. And off the field, it's a big laugh, 
a big joke. a joke that is now in its 17th year. But elephant Polo 
is as difficult as it looks. Them being friendly animals, herd animals, 
they love each other. They don't particularly want to run away. They 
want to stay together. And unlike regular Polo, in this game, the 
player is driven by a Mahout, who steers the elephant with his feet. 
So you're playing elephant Polo, you have the elephant's brain, the 
driver's brain and your own brain. So I think that the combination 
and the coordination of getting the three brains working in the same 
direction is the difficult part. It can be dangerous. We get hit on 
our legs and even, heads by the Polo mallets. Elephants differ in 
size and speed, so to play fair, teams have to swap jumbos half the 
time. Elephants may not move like grease lightning, but they're more 
maneuverable than they seem. An elephant is, you know, a bit like 
a tank. It can actually move backwards and right and left, and a forward 
or reverse motion. It's not the quickest motion you've ever seen, 
but it's quite effective. And a lot of fun, say elephant Polo participants. 
Elephant Polo is becoming more popular in Nepal, but may remain unique 
to asia. Most countries don't have elephants, and the African elephant's 
ears are too big. They would get in the way of the Polo mallets. As 
the game cannot go out into the world, the world has to come to Nepal. 
Visitors from the United States, Britain and Philippines make the 
mountain trek each year. Anita Pratap, CNN, Nepal.
