The ``bete noir'' of French politics, the extreme-right National Front, 
is on the verge of imploding in a vicious public spectacle, and mainstream 
parties are lapping up the name-calling and low blows. The demise 
of the National Front in its current form would amount to a small 
earthquake on the French political landscape, pummeled for nearly 
15 years by the divisive power of the party accused of racism and 
anti-Semitism. A week after the National Front erupted in crisis, 
with bitter feuding between its top two figures _ charismatic leader 
Jean-Marie Le Pen and former No. 2 man Bruno Megret _ the schism appeared 
all but complete. The question was who, if anyone, might profit from 
an eventual splintering of the far right without committing political 
suicide. ``This is blessed bread,'' said Yves Verwaerde, on the electoral 
commission of Liberal Democracy, a new rightist party. ``It's a real 
calamity for the left.'' The National Front has long been considered 
a political pariah but proved a magnet for voters dissatisfied with 
the traditional right. The anti-immigration party has for years garnered 
15 percent of the vote in elections, local, regional and national, 
bolstering the left while robbing votes from the right, which was 
brought to its knees in 1997 legislative elections. With European 
Parliamentary elections seven months away, the possible disintegration 
of the National Front means unexpected complications. Politicians 
watched cautiously. Le Pen fears Megret is out to unseat him and has 
publicly called his followers ``traitors'' and accused them of ``racism'' 
and ``extremism'' _ labels usually pinned on Le Pen himself. Megret 
shares the same ideological ground as Le Pen, but has strived to dilute 
the stigma attached to the party. It is widely assumed the National 
Front will split into two groups. According to the scenario laid out 
in the press, Le Pen would head a reduced party, keeping the National 
Front name. Megret would start up a new party. The French media relished 
recounting the divorce between the flamboyant, silver-haired Le Pen, 
at 70 still a fiery orator, and Megret, an understated technocrat 
of 47. Some of the meanest scenes were played out before television 
cameras. At a rally Friday in Metz, Le Pen compared himself to Julius 
Caesar and Megret to Brutus, the adopted son who slew the Roman emperor. 
``But what differentiates me from Caesar,'' Le Pen said, ``as Brutus 
approaches, knife in hand ... is that I pull out my sword and kill 
Brutus before he kills me.'' Le Pen fired Megret from his post of 
general delegate after the crisis exploded 10 days ago, and, on Friday, 
suspended him and four allies from the party after they called for 
an extraordinary congress to unify ranks. On Thursday, Serge Martinez, 
a Megret loyalist also suspended, was refused access to a post office 
box used to gather votes for the special congress. Megret loyalists 
also accuse the Le Pen camp of an illegal search of a Marseille office, 
with intruders pulling pictures of Megret from walls and making off 
with forms for the special congress. The National Front crisis ``is 
good news'' for the right, the secretary general of President Jacques 
Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic party said in an interview 
published Friday. ``If (National Front) voters or activists want to 
turn away from this party to join us, we will accept them,'' Nicolas 
Sarkozy was quoted as saying in the newspaper Le Figaro. Others were 
more cautious. Those daring to favor taking National Front members 
into their parties specified that any offer would exclude former officials. 
Regional elections in March underscored the stigma attached to dealings 
with the National Front. Seven rightist politicians elected with National 
Front votes were banished or resigned from their party. But former 
Defense Minister Charles Millon, one of the disgraced officials, said 
in an interview in Saturday's Lyon paper Le Progres that he would 
willingly take both National Front members and elected officials into 
his new movement. The fear is that extreme-rightist theses will creep 
into other parties' programs, becoming acceptable political fare. 
National Front ideas, like a ``little bird, could settle in the nests 
of other parties,'' Jean-Marc Ayrault, head of the Socialist parliamentary 
group, warned lawmakers. The National Front, founded in 1972, first 
got noticed in 1984 with an 11 percent score in European parliamentary 
elections. Conservatives accused the late Socialist President Francois 
Mitterrand of endowing the party with lasting clout by switching to 
a proportional voting system in 1986 legislative elections. The National 
Front got 35 seats. Since then, the party has stalked the political 
scene. ``We must let them kill each other, and count the pieces when 
it's over,'' said Pascal Clement, a Liberal Democracy lawmaker. ``Above 
all, we must do nothing and say as little as possible.''
