Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., announced Sunday that he would not run for 
president in 2000, explaining that after several months of pondering 
his political future, he had concluded that his talents could be best 
applied on Capitol Hill. Kerrey, 55, said Vice President Al Gore's 
current strong lead in the race for the nomination influenced his 
decision not to make a second White House bid. He was briefly a candidate 
in 1992. But other factors were at play, too, he added, saying that 
the most important of them was the political debt he owed his fellow 
Nebraskans, who elected him to two terms in the Senate. Kerrey then 
asked them to return him to Washington for a third term in 2000, when 
he will be up for re-election. ``My choice is not whether or not I 
will try to lead,'' he said at a news conference. ``My choice is how 
best can I lead. I have made this decision here at home with my family 
and with my friends. They simply will not allow conceit or selfish 
hunger for power to seduce me into making a false choice.'' While 
Gore's strong early lead among Democrats may have given Kerrey second 
thoughts about the race, other Democrats have indicated they may try 
to take him on. Both Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and former Sen. 
Bill Bradley of New Jersey have formed committees to help them explore 
whether to run. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, Sen. John Kerry 
of Massachusetts and the Rev. Jesse Jackson say they may join the 
contest. Kerrey said that while he would not be a presidential candidate 
in 2000, he still would try to influence the debate, especially on 
national defense, Social Security and education. Kerrey had promised 
a decision by year's end. He met Sunday for about two hours with 100 
relatives, friends and political advisers. The senator said he had 
told them he thought he should continue representing Nebraska in the 
Senate. ``I was not persuaded otherwise,'' he said. Some encouraged 
him to run, Kerrey said, and some urged him not to. He said Gene Glock, 
a Nebraska farmer and adviser on agricultural policy, had told him 
that he should return to private life because political life seemed 
to be wearing him out. Kerrey, a divorced former Navy SEAL who lost 
his leg in the Vietnam War, was Nebraska's governor from 1983 to 1987. 
Choosing not to seek re-election in 1986, he won a Senate seat in 
1988 and was re-elected in 1994. He sought the 1992 Democratic presidential 
nomination but withdrew in March. His name came up in 1992 as a vice-presidential 
possibility. Kerrey said he would go to Tennessee and talk to Gore 
about such a place on the 2000 ticket if the vice president was nominated 
and called him. But Kerrey added, ``I don't feel that my skills are 
applied very well in any position that has vice and a hyphen in front 
of it.''
