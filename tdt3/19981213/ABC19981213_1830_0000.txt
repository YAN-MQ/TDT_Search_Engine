On "World News Tonight" this Sunday -- the chairman of the house Judiciary 
committee calls on President Clinton to step down -- but the president 
isn't listening. I have no intention of resigning. Trying to salvage 
the mideast peace accord, as Palestinians prepare for the first visit 
by a U.S. president. And the growing scandal over the selection of 
the Olympic host cities. New accusations of bribery.
