For weeks, on the practice field, on the team bus and in the hallway 
between team meetings, Giants wide receiver Amani Toomer would sneak 
up behind quarterback Kent Graham. ``Throw me the ball,'' Toomer would 
say. ``I'll make you famous.'' Sunday afternoon, 57 seconds remained 
in the game between the Giants and a Denver team chasing history when 
Graham looked across the huddle at Toomer and called this play: ``A2, 
double seam.'' It was Toomer's time, his wish no longer a whisper 
in a hallway. Seconds later, with the Giants trailing by 16-13, a 
Graham pass was spiraling toward Toomer in the end zone. ``The ball 
was in the air and looked really big,'' he later said. ``It looked 
like the Hindenburg. I knew I was going to catch it.'' An acrobatic 
catch left Toomer lying in the back of the end zone with a 37-yard 
touchdown pass, and 48 fitful seconds later, the Broncos' undefeated 
season was no longer. A 20-16 Giants victory three weeks from the 
end of the regular season had preserved the singular achievement of 
the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the National Football League's only team 
to go unbeaten in both the regular season and post-season. A dreary 
Giants season suddenly had a flashy moment of significance, a game 
that is among the biggest upsets in the history of the league's regular 
season. On the anniversary of last year's division title-clinching 
victory over the Washington Redskins, Giants Stadium was again the 
scene of wild celebration on the field and in the stands. ``This team 
will be remembered for this game,'' Coach Jim Fassel said of his Giants, 
who have a 6-8 record, and remarkably, are one game behind Tampa Bay 
and Arizona in the chase for a wild-card playoff berth. ``Not for 
all the other things that have gone on this year.'' Said Graham: ``This 
is what dreams are made of.'' And Toomer, who has been used sparingly 
for most of three Giants seasons, felt all his jabbering at Graham 
had paid off. ``I hound Kent every day,'' he said with a wide smile. 
``And I was right.'' If Graham is not famous, as Toomer predicted, 
at least he has a charming story to entertain his grandchildren. It 
will be a tale about the day Graham, a career back-up leading a losing 
team, outplayed John Elway, a future Hall of Famer who was guiding 
a team that had not lost in 13 games this season. Graham completed 
21 of 33 passes for 265 yards and two touchdowns and did not throw 
an interception. Elway completed 19 of 36 passes for 180 yards, with 
no touchdown passes and one interception. In five games at Giants 
Stadium, Elway has a 1-4 record, with three touchdown passes and five 
interceptions. ``Amazing, unbelievable, fantastic,'' said Graham, 
whose starting job was in jeopardy entering Sunday's game. ``It was 
all of those things.'' For the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos, 
it was a sobering game of surprises. ``It's sad and it hurts because 
I think we thought right to the end that we'd pull it out,'' said 
Denver running back Terrell Davis. ``You go so long without losing, 
you start to think you'll pull them all out. No one on our team believed 
we'd lose until time ran out, and then it became very real.'' The 
game ended with the Broncos at the Giants' 30-yard line, and with 
Elway heaving a final desperation pass at the end zone that was batted 
down by the Giants' Percy Ellsworth. ``It was like going for a basketball 
rebound,'' said Ellsworth, a former high school basketball All-American. 
``You've got to take it away from the other team.'' As Ellsworth spoke, 
he stood next to a bulletin board that contained the message ``Shock 
the World.'' The Giants had delivered this shock to the football community 
with a swarming defense that for one of the few times this season 
resembled the unit that led the 1997 Giants to a division title. The 
Giants sacked Elway three times and did not allow Denver a touchdown 
until the fourth quarter. An ingenious maneuver _ using the rookie 
safety Shaun Williams as the replacement for the injured nickel linebacker 
Scott Galyon _ proved fruitful. Williams made a pivotal interception 
of Elway and was a key reason the Giants were able to limit Denver's 
All-Pro tight end Shannon Sharpe to 4 catches and just 25 passing 
yards. On offense, the Giants looked unusually fluid and confident. 
running their plays crisply and blocking with authority. Graham was 
sacked just once, and that was because his receivers were covered. 
Giants running back Gary Brown ran for 112 yards on only 18 carries, 
averaging 6.2 yards a attempt. The combination of good defense and 
an effective offense kept the Giants in the game early, even though 
the Broncos were moving the football and led by 6-3 late in the second 
quarter. But with 51 seconds left in the half, Graham connected with 
running back Tiki Barber, who caught Graham's pass in the left flat 
and ran untouched into the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown. Barber's 
score was the last play in a 15-play, 80-yard drive that was one of 
the Giants' best possessions of the season. The Giants' lead was cut 
to 10-9 with a third-quarter Denver field goal, but Williams' interception 
in the fourth quarter set in motion another Giant drive, fueled by 
a 45-yard run by Brown, to the Broncos' 1-yard line. From there, Brown 
was stopped in his third-down attempt to score running up the middle. 
Fassel made the safe decision on fourth down, sending in Brad Daluiso 
to kick a 19-yard field goal for a 13-9 lead. It was an unpopular 
choice inside Giants Stadium at the time, and a potentially controversial 
one when the Broncos regained the lead on a 27-yard touchdown run 
by Davis on Denver's next possession. ``The way our defense was playing,'' 
Fassel said. ``I thought the field goal made sense.'' Fassel spent 
less time defending his decision to kick the field goal because of 
the game-winning Graham-to-Toomer touchdown pass. But before that 
strike, there were more tense moments for the Giants. Brown had not 
fumbled the football since the end of the 1993 season _ or 807 consecutive 
touches of the ball _ but he fumbled his final carry of Sunday's game 
with 3:36 left. But the Giants' defense forced another Denver punt, 
one which rolled past Toomer and had Graham beginning the Giants' 
final drive at his 14-yard line with 1:49 remaining. In the huddle, 
wide receiver Chris Calloway _ who may be the quietest Giant off the 
field _ shouted to his teammates: ``We're going to win this game.'' 
Calloway then caught a 15-yard pass from Graham. On the next play, 
Graham scrambled up the middle for 23 yards. On a third-and-10, Graham 
completed an 11-yard pass to the rookie Joe Jurevicius, who went out 
of bounds at the Denver 37. On the next play, even though the Giants 
were almost in range to attempt a game-tying field goal, Graham went 
deep to Toomer. ``I said: `We've got to go after them right here,' 
'' Graham said. Toomer ran to his position at the far right edge of 
the Giants' formation. The Giants had four receivers split wide and 
the Broncos defenders were mostly bunched to the left, away from Toomer. 
``As soon as I saw they had man-to-man coverage on my side,'' Toomer 
said. ``I knew they were in trouble.'' He knew, as he had predicted, 
that he, and Graham, might be famous.
