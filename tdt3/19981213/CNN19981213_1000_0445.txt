U.N. weapons inspectors have resumed full-scale operations in Iraq. 
An Iraqi government spokesman says the inspectors visited 24 sites 
yesterday, including one deemed "sensitive," without incident. The 
sites were not identified. But reports say witnesses saw U.N. inspectors' 
vehicles outside the offices of the Iraqi military industry commission.
