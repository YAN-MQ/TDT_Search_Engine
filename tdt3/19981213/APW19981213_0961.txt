Let's get right down to what most people really want to know about 
``The Blue Room,'' the vehicle which has brought Nicole Kidman to 
Broadway. Yes, Kidman, in various stages of demure undress, is just 
about perfect, physically and otherwise. The play, unfortunately, 
is not, despite director Sam Mendes' highly kinetic production that 
races through 10 short scenes of seduction. Arriving Sunday at the 
Cort Theater on a tidal wave of burblings from the British press, 
``The Blue Room'' is a chilly, neon-lit meditation on sex that playwright 
David Hare has freely adapted from Arthur Schnitzler's ``La Ronde.'' 
The production has a stainless-steel heart despite Kidman's magnetic 
presence. The actress at least makes the evening watchable, although 
you won't care very much for the people Kidman and her able co-star, 
Iain Glen, portray. Each of them plays a quintet of characters in 
an unnamed city that seems suspiciously like present-day London. We 
first meet a young hooker, new to the trade, trying to pick up a cocky 
taxicab driver. The prostitute is Hare's most appealing creation, 
probably because she is the most vulnerable, a quality that is absent 
from the others who populate Hare's round-robin of a drama. The cab 
driver then moves on to an au pair who, in turn, finds herself in 
bed with her employer's son, a nervous and underachieving student. 
Those moments of sex are done in blackout, accompanied by an audible 
crackle of electric current and, in the production's funniest gimmick, 
subtitles that announce the duration of the experiences. These range 
from zero minutes on up to more than two hours. Hare sketches the 
couplings and uncouplings with blandness and surprisingly little joy 
or romance. These people are not having much fun. What's worse, you 
don't care about them, and the author's attempts at humor _ including 
another tired go at the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber _ are lame. 
Hare can be a remarkable playwright, adept at portraying passion or 
at least commitment. That passion came through last season in ``The 
Judas Kiss,'' his compelling take on an incident in the life of a 
gracefully resigned Oscar Wilde. Here, disappointment is the order 
of the day. Yet his actors in ``The Blue Room'' work furiously at 
not letting him down. Kidman has an unaffected, direct manner and 
a strong voice. She is especially good as a married woman, nervously 
meeting the hapless student. She has a particularly malleable face, 
a countenance that can change completely just with the help of a new 
hairstyle. Kidman is less convincing as the actress, an older woman 
who carries on with a playwright and then a younger man, an uptight 
aristocrat. Her youthful demeanor works against the woman's worldliness 
as a grand lady of the theater. The character and costume changes 
are marvels of lightning ingenuity. Glen, a square-jawed, serious-looking 
fellow, transforms himself with astonishing speed. His student exudes 
insecurity, while the politician and the playwright are models of 
self-absorption. The talk of sex is surprisingly coy as the couples 
maneuver each other into bed. Not that you get to see Kidman in the 
altogether. Her nude scenes are discreet _ and cleverly lighted by 
Hugh Vanstone _ compared to the undrapings of Glen who even gets to 
do a cartwheel in the buff. These sexual entanglements are played 
out on designer Mark Thompson's spare, almost minimalist settings, 
which trundle on and off stage with conveyer-belt precision. Precision 
is the hallmark of Mendes' production. Everything works with an unemotional 
and uninvolving efficiency. And despite the considerable allure of 
Kidman,''The Blue Room'' makes for a particularly frosty evening of 
theater.
