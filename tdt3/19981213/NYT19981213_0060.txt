The conference room in the Sheraton New Orleans hotel was quiet, save 
for the shoo-shoo-shoo deep-breathing sounds coming from the 80 men 
and women in nametags silently circling the room. After a minute, 
the seminar leader held up her hand to halt the mute crowd. ``Now, 
strike the pose of a hero,'' she instructed. ``Strike the statue of 
the gods and goddesses that you are!'' She asked the group to cry 
out words they felt when they thought of themselves as heroes. There 
was palpable hesitation, then a human-resources executive from Wells 
Fargo, a string of pearls around her neck, lifted her arms in the 
air. ``I am a thunderbolt!'' she shouted. A man in a Hawaiian-print 
shirt exclaimed ``Hallelujah!'' as he posed, one arm extended behind 
him as if he were preparing to toss a discus. A computer-company executive 
in high heels put her hands defiantly on her hips and cried, hesitantly: 
``You, you _ you fabulous goddess you!'' If it sounds like an EST 
seminar or some sort of Tony Robbins inspirational jamboree, it wasn't. 
It was, in fact, one of several instructional sessions offered at 
a conference _ actually, the organizers prefer the term ``gathering'' 
_ hosted this month by Fast Company, a technology-oriented business 
magazine targeted to young entrepreneurs. A feel-good business bible 
for the generation that never leaves home without a Palm Pilot, Fast 
Company is published by Mortimer Zuckerman. Fast Company attracted 
four hundred people to this, its second ``Real Time'' conference. 
And while Fast Company may be the only magazine to host a conference 
at which the former secretary of labor, Robert Reich, led an audience 
of hundreds in an impromptu kazoo concert, it is not alone in its 
mission. In an attempt to solidify the relationship with readers _ 
and their checkbooks _ publishers have begun to organize events for 
subscribers and readers beyond the pages of their magazines. ``Simply 
selling a magazine is just not enough anymore,'' said Alan Webber, 
one of Fast Company's two founding editors. In addition to the Real 
Time conferences, the 3-year-old magazine encourages readers to form 
discussion groups, a network of 9,300 readers the editors call the 
``Company of Friends.'' The principle of bringing readers in other 
than through the pages of the magazine is also at work at other media 
companies. Jay MacDonald, chief executive of MacDonald Communications, 
a New York media company that owns Working Woman and Working Mother 
magazines, has founded four annual conferences _ not only as an instrument 
with which to extend the brand identities of his two magazines, but 
as profit-making ventures _ in the last two years. Forbes magazine 
founded the Forbes Management Conference Group in 1995. McGraw-Hill's 
Business Week plays host to eight to 12 conferences a year. And Time 
Warner's Fortune employs a staff of 20 simply for its conference activity. 
Fast Company's Webber _ who is fond of saying, ``Remember, it's not 
a magazine, it's a movement'' _ is a trim 50-year-old who, along with 
William Taylor, grew tired of his work as an editor at The Harvard 
Business Review four years ago. Together, they created a 103-page 
prototype and, ``after a year of wandering the canyons of Manhattan,'' 
said Taylor, sold a majority stake in the business to Zuckerman. Taylor 
added that Zuckerman's leadership had been strictly hands-off _ a 
contrast to what may politely be described as his usual, hands-on 
dedication to his other properties like The Daily News of New York 
and U.S. News &AMP; World Report. Fast Company isn't your parents' 
business magazine. It styles itself as a guidebook for the ambitious 
yet sensitive young businessperson facing a swiftly changing and increasingly 
ruthless economy. The magazine's goal: to encourage readers to think 
in contrarian terms about the business world, with stories like ``Money! 
Power! Fame! (And Other Ways to Self-Destruct)'' and ``Green is Good,'' 
an article about ecological mindfulness in the corporate world. The 
magazine's conference _ while light on hard information and heavy 
on motivational speakers _ is in essence Fast Company's version of 
a three-day MBA. ``Frequently, business magazines have conferences 
because you're able to actually have a focus and a theme and a practical 
outcome,'' Webber said. ``But one of the things that's different with 
ours is that we view our gatherings as a part of the editorial product. 
Other magazines have separate conference arms that are hived off from 
the editorial group.'' Judging from the conference here, it's also 
a chance for people working in technology to work on their people 
skills. Michael Gort, an information technology consultant from Old 
Greenwich, Conn., pointed out that working in software, for example, 
can be lonely. ``You can get alienated in this field,'' he said. ``You 
can now have an entire product team that develops a product without 
ever meeting each other.'' Peter Kalish, president of a software design 
company in Orem, Utah, said that he read Fast Company because no other 
business magazine focused on issues with the same ``human touch.'' 
``The business press doesn't address your feelings, your insecurities,'' 
he added. ``The first time I saw Fast Company, I saw that they did. 
And there's a lot of fear out there. We all need to address that.'' 
Taylor, who is 40, said that kind of feedback keeps Fast Company singularly 
in touch with its readers. ``We convene this two-day conversation 
about where our readers are at, what are they dreaming about and scheming 
about, what are they worrying about,'' Taylor said.``I walk around 
with a much more visceral appreciation for the kinds of themes and 
article and vocabulary words that are going to teach our readers.'' 
The first Real Time conference attracted more than 400 readers who 
attended the conference here, paying $1,500 each. The three-day event 
began on the evening of Dec. 6 with a ``knowledge hunt'' _ a grown-up 
version of a scavenger hunt that required participants to play Pictionary 
on the sidewalk of Bourbon Street _ and included sessions with titles 
like ``Group Grope,'' ``Climbing Your Own Everest,'' ``Here's What 
Imagination Sounds Like,'' and a seminar by a dance troupe about how 
to ``out-dance the competition.'' The attendees all radiated a caffeinated, 
hopeful enthusiasm, and having paid their admission fees and flown 
from California, Utah, Minnesota and Maine, clearly took Real Time 
seriously. One man, pausing for a skim latte at a neighborhood Starbucks, 
even called it a religious experience. Reich delivered the first lecture 
of the conference, and after a few jokes _ ``As you can see, four 
years in the president's cabinet wore me down,'' Reich, who is not 
a tall man, said. ``I used to be 6 feet 2 inches!'' _ spoke seriously 
about the challenge of the global economy, the advent of Euromoney, 
and his fears about the Year 2000 computer problem. At times the proceedings 
bordered on the surreal _ Reich's lengthy speech about how his artificial 
hips were actually an allegory for global trade (they were designed 
in France, produced in Germany and implanted in the United States), 
for example, or the scene of hundreds of otherwise professional-looking 
conference attendees drinking Hurricanes (a New Orleans rum specialty) 
and gyrating to ``The Mardi Gras Mambo'' at Tip's Big Room. But it 
didn't seem to matter to the Fast Company editors. After three years, 
the magazine _ which was introduced with the publication of 100,000 
copies _ will guarantee a rate base of 305,000 in January. Its ad 
sales appear robust. In 1996, the first year of publication, 394 ad 
pages brought in $3,031,280 in revenue, according to the Publishers 
Information Bureau. In 1997, ad pages almost doubled to 696, resulting 
in $7,095,578 in revenue. With this year's August issue, the magazine 
switched from bi-monthly publication to monthly. And for 1998, Julian 
Lowin, publisher of Fast Company, said he expected to see $15 million 
in ad revenue. The Publishers Information Bureau figure for January 
to October 1998 is $10,983,320, but Lowin said the last three months 
of the year would not only be monthly, but particularly rich with 
ads. After the conference, Webber and Taylor returned to their offices 
in Boston. (Their staff in New York works in the same building on 
West 33rd Street as The Daily News.) Taylor said he had gleaned several 
ideas for stories from the conference. ``You know, Fast Company is 
not The New Yorker,'' he said, his voice hoarse from days of nonstop 
networking. ``We're not editors who can go off into a cave and think 
deep thoughts and come out with a profound message. We need to be 
out there, with our readers, talking to them, understanding them.'' 
And Webber said he didn't mind the conference's occasionally warm-and-fuzzy 
bent or its effect on the gravity with which readers or advertisers 
perceive Fast Company. ``In the old world of business and management, 
it was all about `Check your emotions at the door, check your individuality 
at the door,''' he said. ``It was the world of the organization man. 
The new world is `Bring it all in.' Be your own individual. If you're 
interested in zydeco, and you work at a software company, maybe there's 
a way to integrate zydeco into a new software design.'' As for Zuckerman, 
he wasn't particularly interested in zydeco software. ``I'm just happy 
to be a passenger on their train,'' he said.
