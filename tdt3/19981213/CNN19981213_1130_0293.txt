An informal CNN survey finds about 30 house members have yet to make 
up their minds on impeachment. Many of them are moderate republicans. 
This morning, two of those undecided members talked about the difficult 
decision they face. I think what's happening is the house will have 
a single choice, what I heard in the press today. We will have a single 
choice between impeachment or exoneration. Impeachment, then, may 
be the only choice we have in order to bring this forward to the point 
where the president has to deal with it at some point, to admit what 
happened and either pay a fine and take whatever penalties the Senate 
wants to give to him, or to take it all the, the whole route to trial 
and either conviction or -- I think you have to separate your feelings 
for Bill Clinton, the president, versus your feelings about the presidency. 
Because this vote is going to have a lot of significance 20 and 25 
years down the road and I think all of us are trying to figure out 
how you balance those competing interests between understanding that 
the rule of law's important, even more so for, then for anybody, the 
president, it's got to apply to him. I also think at the same time 
you have to worry if we act too precipitously, does this open the 
door? That's a tough balancing act.
