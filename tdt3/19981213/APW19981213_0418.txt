The maker of two popular brands of Christmas cake launched a counteroffensive 
Sunday after a rat poison scare that alarmed the nation. After testing, 
the government determined that the only cakes with poison in them 
were two sent to the ANSA news agency. They were accompanied by a 
warning from animal-rights activists that cakes, called ``panettone,'' 
had been injected with poison nationwide. Nestle Italia put on a ``panettone'' 
festival Sunday in front of Milan's central train station in a bid 
to restore faith in its Motta and Alemagna brand cakes. People dressed 
in blue Santa Claus costumes handed out free samples as cheery Christmas 
tunes played. Nestle also handed out free cakes in Rome. An undersecretary 
of the interior, Diego Masi, attended the Milan event, publicly sampling 
the yeast cakes laden with fruit and nuts that are an indispensable 
part of Christmas in Italy. He declared the poison alert over. ``It 
facts are simple,'' Masi said, according to the ANSA news agency. 
``We're talking about just two panettone, which weren't sold but were 
mailed to ANSA.'' The government did spot checks of panettone taken 
off store shelves after ANSA got the two poisoned ones on Thursday 
night and they tested positive for rat poison. The president of Nestle 
Italia, Yves Barbieux, had harsh words for the media, which he said 
had blown the incident out of proportion. ``It's incredible that in 
Italy, no one's talking about the Clinton impeachment, the tragic 
air crash (in Thailand), but only about two poisoned panettone,'' 
he said bitterly. Injected them with rat poison. The warnings from 
the Animal Liberation Front that accompanied the two poisoned cakes 
said the group was protesting the use of genetically engineered ingredients, 
such as certain types of wheat, in the cakes. ``It was a great success 
for the ecoterrorists,'' Barbieux said of the scare. Nestle says it 
isn't currently using such ingredients in the products sold in Italy. 
But, Barbieux said defiantly, it plans to in the future. ``We will 
use these products, as we do in the rest of Europe, because its part 
of progress,'' he said. ``We're trying to improve production and lower 
prices.'' Police are questioning members of the Animal Liberation 
Front, an organization perhaps best known for staging raids on laboratories 
that experiment on animals and on mink farms.
