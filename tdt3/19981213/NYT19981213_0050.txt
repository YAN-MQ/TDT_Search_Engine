The judgment of history after the impeachment and near conviction 
of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 was that Congress had badly overstepped 
proper bounds. It was 106 years before the impeachment of a president 
was seriously considered again. By contrast, after the impeachment 
proceedings against President Richard Nixon in 1974, the national 
consensus was that the special prosecutors, Archibald Cox and Leon 
Jaworski, had been protectors of the public weal and that Congress 
had acted responsibly and even heroicly. As a consequence, every president 
since Nixon has faced, to one degree or another, criminal inquiry 
by an independent counsel, and Congress has used its power of investigation 
time and again to settle political scores. By the same token, both 
sides argued in the House Judiciary Committee's debate last week that 
the effort to impeach President Clinton would have lasting effects 
on the presidency. Politicians and scholars who were interviewed over 
the weekend did not dispute that, but they disagreed over what the 
legacy would be. Democrats on the Judiciary Committee maintained that 
a Clinton impeachment would mean that for years to come, whenever 
Congress was controlled by the party opposing the president, the president 
would be in jeopardy of being impeached. ``We will be setting a precedent 
that could seriously weaken the office of the presidency,'' said Rep. 
Charles Schumer of New York. ``We will be substantially lowering the 
bar for removing a sitting president so that we will be in danger 
of all too frequently investigating presidents and seeking to remove 
them from office.'' In an interview, another Democrat, Rep. Bill Delahunt 
of Massachusetts, said that ``the balance of power between the branches 
of government is at risk,'' and he predicted that the country was 
in for ``a period of partisan retribution.'' But Republicans asserted 
that Clinton had diminished the presidency with his reckless conduct 
and that the lesson for future presidents was that they would be held 
to high personal standards. Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas put it this 
way: ``If our actions send a message that future presidents should 
not lie under oath; should tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth, as President Clinton swore to do when giving testimony 
before a judge and then a grand jury; that future presidents should 
uphold the law as President Clinton swore to do when he took the oath 
of office as president; that future presidents should not obstruct 
justice, as President Clinton did for seven months as he admittedly 
deceived the American people and those associated with the investigation; 
if these are the precedents Congress sets, if these are the standards 
future presidents then live by, we'd need not fear our actions.'' 
Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, said that it would take 
time before it was apparent which side was right. ``Within a few years, 
Americans will probably reach a consensus on whether this was legitimate 
or whether members of Congress were angry with the president because 
of things that went beyond the articles of impeachment,'' Beschloss 
said. ``The question is how this whole year stands up in history.'' 
Former Sen. Warren Rudman, who has been following the debate from 
his home in New Hampshire, said he was worried by the direction his 
fellow Republicans were taking because he thought the Constitution 
reserved impeachment for official misconduct. But Rudman said he did 
not foresee dire consequences for the presidency. ``If a George W. 
Bush or a Bill Bradley gets elected next time,'' he said, ``what has 
happened during this horrible time will not have any effect on their 
presidency.'' Rudman continued: ``This country has been through crises 
with presidents time after time. People always say the country's going 
to collapse. A fresh face with a new set of ideas changes everything.'' 
Marshall Wittmann, a conservative scholar at the Heritage Foundation, 
said the consequences of a Clinton impeachment might have been more 
severe at a different time in the nation's history _ before the end 
of the Cold War, for instance, or during an economic crisis. Nowadays, 
``Washington just doesn't matter as much as it once did,'' he said, 
``and neither does the presidency.'' Douglas Brinkley, a historian 
at the University of New Orleans, agreed with the notion that in the 
prosperous, peaceful 1990s, the presidency might not be the office 
it once was. ``When we reflect back at this time,'' he said, ``people 
like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and Ted Turner may be remembered 
more than Bill Clinton.'' ``But the presidency has only been diminished 
temporarily,'' Brinkley said. The time will come, he added, when the 
president of the United States will once again be the dominant figure 
in the world. The main consequence of the Clinton presidency, Brinkley 
said, may be that no president will leave a historical record. Knowing 
that they they are subject to incessant investigations, presidents 
will not be able to afford to keep diaries or tape-record their recollections, 
lest they be subpoenaed. ``Presidents will be careful not to leave 
tracks,'' he said, ``and history and historians will suffer.''
