A British Broadcasting Corp. survey published Sunday indicates most 
Britons do not know the name of the European single currency, how 
much it is worth or when its notes and coins will be introduced. The 
currency, called the euro, is being introduced for 11 EU countries, 
excluding Britain, on January 1. The launch is meant to create a single 
bloc that will rival the United States and Japan as a global economic 
power. Although the government has said it broadly supports entry 
into the euro, most Britons remain skeptical about whether joining 
would be good for Britain. The government has said it will not make 
a decision until it has seen the effect of the new currency. The telephone 
survey of 1,000 people, conducted by research group Audience Selection 
between Nov. 27 and Nov. 29, revealed that 51 percent of Britons cannot 
name the euro, with guesses at its name including Equarder, Ecru, 
Etu, Eu and Curo. Estimates of its value ranged from one penny to 
8 pounds (dlrs 13.20), with 10 percent of those questioned knowing 
it would be worth about 70 pence (dlrs 1.15). Most people thought 
they would be able to use notes and cash next year, with only 5 percent 
knowing they would not be introduced until 2002, the BBC said. The 
survey had a margin of error of 3 percent. Bankers are divided over 
how the British pound will respond next year to the introduction of 
the euro and the melding of 11 European economies. On Wednesday, investor 
George Soros told a House of Commons committee that the pound could 
be vulnerable to speculators if Britain didn't join the single currency, 
while most economists say the new currency is unlikely to make an 
immediate difference. Soros, whose speculative attacks on the pound 
were a factor in forcing it out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism 
in 1992, reiterated his view in an interview on London Weekend Television 
on Sunday. Chief Treasury Secretary Stephen Byers rejected those warnings 
Sunday, but he conceded the launch of the euro could lead to speculation 
affecting currencies worldwide. ``George Soros himself concedes that 
he's made quite a few blunders himself,'' Byers told satellite television 
network SKY News. ``I think he's wrong, and the evidence he gave before 
the Treasury Select Committee wasn't as clear as that. ``What he did 
say was that, clearly, once we get the single currency established 
in the New Year there may be speculation not just affecting the pound 
but across the world, and I think we need to look very carefully at 
that.''
