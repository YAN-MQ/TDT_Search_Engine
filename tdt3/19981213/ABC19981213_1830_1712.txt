That's our report for tonight. Later on "20/20 Sunday," a look at 
an epidemic of random killings along america's freight rail lines, 
that police can't solve. And tomorrow on "Good Morning America," an 
interview with heisman trophy winner Ricky Williams. I'm Elizabeth 
Vargas in London. Good night.
