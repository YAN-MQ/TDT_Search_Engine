It's the first day on the job for Florida's new governor. Outgoing 
lieutenant-governor buddy McKay was sworn in early this morning. He 
succeeds Lawton Chiles, who died of an apparent heart attack yesterday. 
Chiles had only three weeks remaining in his term. Governor-elect 
Jeb bush, son of former President George bush, begins his term in 
early January. Bush says it's a sad moment for all floridians. I was 
shocked to hear about the passing away of governor Chiles. He was 
a true Florida statesman. He served for nearly 40 years, this state. 
He did it with distinction, with honor, with integrity, and while 
I may have had a few disagreements with him, I enormously respected 
his leadership abilities and his commitment to children. So I'm saddened 
by his loss today, and I send my regards and my respect to his family 
and I will be praying for them. Lawton Chiles was 68. He is survived 
by his wife and four children.
