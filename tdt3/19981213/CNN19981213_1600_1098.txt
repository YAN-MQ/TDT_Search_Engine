I'm a music major. It's tough. I mean, you go away from home, and 
I really wanted to do well. So what I really needed... was a big-screen 
notebook with dvd. But I couldn't find the right one. My roommate 
told me that I could get Dell on the Internet. Dell built a notebook 
just for me. I got right online and found answers... to a million 
questions at some pretty weird hours. They're making me look way too 
smart. Dell computers use Intel Pentium II processors. Matt Yallof, 
"CNN Headline Sports."
