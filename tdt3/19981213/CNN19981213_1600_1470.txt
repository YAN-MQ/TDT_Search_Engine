Almost 400 Foster children have received the holiday gift of a lifetime 
-- their own families. Hundreds of lawyers, judges and social workers 
in a Los Angeles county courtroom volunteered their time this weekend 
to grant the children official adoptive papers. Officials say it was 
the largest number of Foster children ever adopted in a single day. 
Some of the children had been living with Foster parents for many 
years, but legal costs and red tape prevented them from being formally 
adopted.
