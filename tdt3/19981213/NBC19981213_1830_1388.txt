now to the growing world-wide effort to arrest one-time dictators 
accused of human rights violations. as nbc's andrea mitchell reports, 
the detention of a former chilean strongman is fueling the process. 
augusto pinochet, fighting extradition to spain to face charges of 
crime against humanity. around the world, it's open season on war 
criminals and former dictators. president clinton ordered a new early 
warning system to detect mass murder. a cia rapid alert center for 
acts of genocide anywhere in the world. clinton met with one of the 
alleged culprits, jeb sahearto. responsible, they say, for killing 
up to 1 million people. in jakarta, a daily clash between police and 
demonstrators. they want to put sahearto to the court. other dictators 
targeted, amin now living in luxury in saudi arabia. guatemala's former 
leader accused of genocide still running for office. mengistu. duvalier 
of haiti enjoying retirement in france. there are many dictators with 
blood on their hands who should be investigated. if the evidence can 
be collected prosecuted. bringing them to justice more likely because 
of the case against pinochet. the u.s. is now caught between its commitment 
to human rights and fear that his prosecution will make it more difficult 
to force other dictators from power. u.s. officials ask, would haiti's 
leaders have given up in 1993 if they thought they would be arrested 
and tried? would serb leaders have negotiated peace in ohio if they 
feared prosecution when they landed in the united states? tough questions 
for the u.s. while human rights lawyers pursue dictators still getting 
away with murder. andrea mitchell, nbc news, washington.
