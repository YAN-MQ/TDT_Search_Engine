At a news conference in Jerusalem today, President Clinton said he 
had no intention of resigning. It was Mr. Clinton's first public reaction 
to the matter since the house judiciary committee passed articles 
of impeachment against him. He was asked whether he would consider 
admitting he committed perjury to appease some members of Congress. 
I did not commit perjury. We had -- if you go back to the hearing, 
we had four prosecutors, two republicans, two democrats -- one the 
head of President Reagan's criminal justice division who went through 
the law in great detail and explained that. That there -- that this 
was not a perjury case, and there was no credible argument on the 
other side. So, I have no intention of doing that.
