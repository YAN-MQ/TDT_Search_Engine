We begin in the NFL, where the Broncos are trying to make history. 
If they can beat the giants today, Denver will become the first team 
since the undefeated 1972 dolphins to start the season 14-0. It can 
also set a record. The falcons can wrap up their first division title 
with a win and a 49ers loss Monday night. A green bay win and Tampa 
loss puts the Packers in the postseason. Meanwhile, the Bucs are hosting 
Pittsburgh. Both are still in the playoff Hunt. Arizona needs to beat 
Philadelphia to stay in the NFC wild card race. Backup Jamie Martin 
started in place of Mark Brunell for the jags. Buffalo is in the playoffs 
with a win and a loss by the steelers and oilers. The Patriots are 
hoping for their second four-game winning streak of the season. But 
they are without Ben coates, whose mother passed away. Washington 
is in Carolina. And the Colts are hosting the bengals.
