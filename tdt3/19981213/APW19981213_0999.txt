Statehooders who want to make Puerto Rico the 51st U.S. state refused 
to concede defeat in divisive elections Sunday that gave an edge to 
supporters of the Caribbean island's commonwealth ties to the United 
States. With 95 percent of votes in, statehood had 46.5 percent of 
votes to 50.2 percent for the ``None of the above'' option adopted 
by the commonwealth party. In a similar non-binding referendum in 
1993, commonwealth beat statehood by 49-46 percent. President Clinton 
has asked Congress to abide by the result of the referendum _ but 
it was unclear what kind of message a ``none of the above'' victory 
could send to Congress. Most likely is a bitter and prolonged argument 
over interpreting the result. Pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello insisted 
he won anyway, arguing that almost all the people who voted for an 
actual status definition supported statehood. He said he would use 
that interpretation to petition Congress to make Puerto Rico a state. 
``Today the people spoke and they said statehood is the future of 
Puerto Rico. The people spoke, and I will obey,'' Rossello told thousands 
of cheering supporters at a victory-type rally as spectacular fireworks 
lit the sky above his party's headquarters. Pro-commonwealth Sen. 
Eudaldo Baez Galib countered, ``If they go to Washington with a petition 
for statehood ... they would be violating the right to vote of the 
majority.'' Some 70 percent of 2.2 million registered voters participated 
in the nonbinding referendum that pitted statehood advocates against 
defenders of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. commonwealth, in which 
islanders are U.S. citizens but have no vote in Washington. Voters 
could choose statehood, the commonwealth option, independence or a 
``free association'' form of independence with U.S. treaty ties. But 
the majority chose ``none of the above'' _ an option Democratic Rep. 
Jose Serrano of New York has said would give Congress little to work 
with. Commonwealth supporters disagreed with the way commonwealth 
was defined on the ballot, especially the suggestion that Congress 
was empowered to revoke islanders' U.S. citizenship. ``We will be 
protecting the future of our children,'' said Ernesto Cabrera, 72, 
who said he marked statehood on his ballot soon after voting stations 
opened. At a polling station in southern Ponce city, an election volunteer 
confronted the 95-year-old founder of the statehood party, Luis A. 
Ferre. ``I know my people, and Americans don't want Puerto Rico to 
be a state,'' said Payton Lewis, a 51-year-old engineer from South 
Carolina who has married and settled on the island. Rossello called,
