on the first full day of his mideast mission, president clinton today 
sought to convince israelis and palestinians that reviving the shaky 
peace process was in everybody's interest. nbc's bob kur is with the 
president in jerusalem. to the cheers of israeli students, president 
clinton sought to reassure this county and its prime minister that 
the united states will stand with them as they take risks for peace. 
our commitment to your security is ironclad. it will not ever change. 
then mr. clinton offered a rationale for the embrace of a peace process 
that has more than its share of doubters and enemies. palestinians 
are recognizing that rejection of israel will not bring their freedom, 
just as israelis recognize that control of palestinians will not bring 
you security. again, today, more trouble and signs the latest peace 
arrangement brokered by the u.s. is far from a sure thing. at a news 
conference, israel's prime minister vowed not to hand over another 
inch of territory to the palestinians unless the fighting stops. the 
palestinian authority must stop incitement and violence at once, and 
they must do so fully and permanently. to keep the peace that process 
going, israel wants them to eliminate parts of their disstruction, 
tomorrow the council is supposed to vote to do just that. today the 
focus was jerusalem. a visit to the grave of former prime minister 
rabin. assassinated by an extremist opposed to the peace process. 
also, a joyous moment. the eight-day hanukkah holiday got under way. 
all this while chelsea clinton visited the remains of the wailing 
wall in jerusalem, a city still fought over in a peace process in 
trouble again. bob kur, nbc news, with the president in israel.
