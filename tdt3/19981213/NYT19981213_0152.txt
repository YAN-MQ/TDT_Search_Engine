For the first time, a federal court has been asked to rule on one 
of the most frequently asked year 2000 liability questions: Does normal 
business liability insurance cover a software company that is sued 
for selling products that cannot cope with the year 2000? The Cincinnati 
Insurance Co., based in Fairfield, Ohio, has asked the U.S. District 
Court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to rule that the policy it sold to Source 
Data Systems does not require it to defend Source Data from lawsuits 
contending that its products cannot recognize dates after Jan. 1, 
2000, or to reimburse Source Data for the the cost of fixing or replacing 
defective products. Cincinnati Insurance filed its request for the 
ruling Dec. 4. The coverage dispute grew out of a lawsuit filed in 
July in a Kentucky state court against Source Data, of Cedar Rapids, 
by the Pineville Community Hospital Association, a Kentucky hospital 
group. Pineville is seeking $1.25 million to cover the cost of replacing 
Source Data hospital management software installed in 1996. Five months 
after the system went on line, according to the complaint, Pineville 
learned that the system could not handle the transition to the year 
2000. Year 2000 legal experts say the issue of insurance coverage 
for software companies is a vital one. If software users with year 
2000 problems cannot reach into the pockets of the software companies' 
insurers for compensation, many software companies could be bankrupted 
_ and many customers out of luck _ if such problems are widespread. 
``There is likely to be an avalanche of these types of cases,'' said 
Walter Andrews, a Washington lawyer who is not involved in the Source 
Data case but represents numerous insurers. Source Data, which is 
now owned by Keane Inc., has denied that its contract with Pineville 
to install the system guaranteed year 2000 capability. But, it says, 
if it is liable, the insurance policy ought to cover its costs. Cincinnati 
Insurance says its general liability policies will cover some year 
2000 problems. But, the insurer argues, the cost of curing foreseen 
defects before there is any damage to individuals or property is clearly 
outside the policies' scope.
