Floridians are bidding governor Lawton Chiles a fond farewell today. 
He died yesterday of heart failure. His supporters and rivals are 
now paying tribute the John Zarrella reports. Lawton Chiles' death 
was sudden and shocking. At 68 years old, Chiles, Florida's democratic 
governor, was retiring from politics next month after completing his 
second term. His legacy is a living one. And it is seen in the face 
of every child who has health care. It lives in the home of every 
family that is better off today for his service. Chiles will always 
be remembered fondly as "walkin' Lawton." Throughout his career, he 
campaigned on foot. It began in 1970. While running for the U.S. Senate, 
Chiles walked 1,003 miles across the state. He won, and served 18 
years in the Senate. When news of his death reached Washington, the 
members of the house judiciary committee deciding on articles of impeachment 
against president clinton observed a moment of silence. Many knew 
Chiles personally from his days in Washington. I worked for him for 
about 18 years. He was a good man. He was a dedicated public servant. 
I didn't agree with him politically in recent years, but I had the 
utmost respect for him. Chiles led Florida through many difficult 
times -- a rash of violent crimes and murders against tourists, hurricane 
Andrew, last winter's deadly tornadoes. He's been a good man and a 
good governor for Florida, and I will never forget visiting my tornado-ravaged 
area with him for nearly a full day earlier this year, and the great 
compassion he showed. Chiles also engineered the state's $13 billion 
windfall settlement with the tobacco industry, a landmark deal. He 
championed education and health care for children. His finest political 
moment may have come in 1994. Running for re-election against political 
newcomer Jeb bush, Chiles' campaign was in trouble. He turned the 
election around when he dubbed himself "the he-coon," meaning bush 
was the novice and he was the wise old raccoon. What time is it? It's 
just before dawn! Governor Lawton Chiles, dead at age 68.
