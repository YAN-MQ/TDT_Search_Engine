Chelsea Clinton visited Jerusalem's Old Walled City on Sunday and 
prayed at Judaism's holiest site on the eve of Hanukkah, the Jewish 
Festival of Lights. In keeping with Jewish custom, she placed a note 
in the Western Wall, last remnant of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed 
by the Romans in A.D. 70. Before placing the note, she sat on a chair 
in front of the Western Wall and then knelt in prayer. During her 
visit, a shofar _ or ram's horn _ sounded a wailing note. Hannukah 
commemorates the eight-day rededication of the Jewish Temple by the 
Maccabees after their victory over the Syrians. The president's daughter, 
dressed in dark pants and jacket, prayed in the Church of the Holy 
Sepulcher, which marks a traditional site of the tomb from which Jesus 
was resurrected after the Crucifixion. Officials said a special room 
was opened for her to pray. Emerging from the church, a smiling Chelsea 
Clinton shook hands with a Greek Orthodox priest. Earlier, she shook 
hands with a group of visiting U.S. Marines. A swarm of Israeli police 
and photographers followed her through the narrow byways of the Old 
City. She strolled along the Cardo, a reconstructed Roman-era walkway 
lined with modern-day shops and ancient ruins, and walked through 
the crowded ``suq,'' or market that is crowded with shops selling 
clothes, aromatic spices, rugs and souvenirs. Tourists, a group of 
Israeli soldiers and shoppers stopped to watch and wave. During her 
tour, she also bought and drank some pomegranate juice in the Muslim 
Quarter.
