In Iran, there's evidence moderate President Mohammed Khatami has 
only limited control over hard-liners in his government, especially 
in the security services. Three intellectuals have been strangled 
to death in recent weeks and a Fourth is missing and feared dead. 
All four are believed to have been supporters of Khatami's moves to 
liberalize Iran. No one has been charged in any of the deaths. Some 
Iranian officials are blaming outside forces for what they say is 
a Campaign to destabilize Iran.
