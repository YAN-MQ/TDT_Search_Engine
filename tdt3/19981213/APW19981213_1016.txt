Talking Teletubbies, Rolex watches and Calvin Klein boxer shorts will 
fill many Christmas stockings across Asia this year. But watch out 
if the goodies are from Hong Kong: They may turn out to be Telotubbies, 
Roluxes and Gioven Kelvins. As Asia's financial crisis persists, more 
holiday shoppers are turning to cheaper counterfeit products. ``People 
don't have as much money now,'' said Calvin Leung, head of intellectual 
property protection of the Customs and Excise Department. ``Do you 
know how much it is to buy a designer suit for your wife? And do you 
know how much you can save if you buy a copy?'' Shoppers from around 
the world know the answer. ``They're terribly fake,'' said Peter Schmidt, 
a German banker living here, who bought three counterfeit Ralph Lauren 
polo T-shirts from a hawker. Schmidt paid 30 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
dlrs 3.80) per shirt _ compared with 430 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 
55) for the real thing. ``You can throw them away after one day,'' 
Schmidt said. In the Temple Street night market, tourists, trendy 
teen-agers and middle-aged shoppers browse at stalls selling clothing, 
toys, electronics, watches, inflatable couches and CDs. At one stall, 
cheap speakers blasted out ``My Heart Will Go On,'' the theme song 
for Hollywood blockbuster ``Titanic.'' But the ``Celine Dion'' was 
conspicuously singing a couple of keys too low with a cold-stricken 
voice. ``This is the real thing,'' the vendor insisted. Some of the 
goods look real enough to fool almost anyone. The 140 Hong Kong dollar 
(U.S. dlrs 18) counterfeit Prada wallets smell like leather. Each 
carries a bogus ``certificate of authenticity.'' Other products are 
outright fakes, like the boxer shorts in boxes emblazoned with the 
initials CK. The fine print says ``Gioven Kelvins.'' A digital watch 
resembling the Casio G-Shock, popular among Asian teen-agers, was 
actually an ``S-Shock.'' Kim Jae Kyong and You Jong Dae, businessmen 
from Seoul, South Korea, haggled with a woman selling fake designer 
bags. She displayed nothing more than photographs of her goods taped 
to a folding table. She recited some numbers on her mobile phone, 
and two assistants emerged minutes later with the products. The woman 
wouldn't identify herself but had a good reason to keep her products 
off the street. ``It's quite dangerous here, and we don't want to 
run into trouble,'' she said. Despite the heavy penalty _ counterfeit 
dealers can face fines or up to five years in prison _ plenty of retailers 
are getting into the lucrative trade. Some of the newly unemployed 
are also at work selling fakes. ``I wouldn't do this if I could find 
a job,'' said a man selling bogus designer bags who gave only his 
first name, Rodrigo. ``You go to jail if you get caught.'' Rodrigo, 
18, lost his job as a waiter and now gets 3,500 Hong Kong dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 449) a month selling fakes. The counterfeits in Hong Kong 
are mostly from mainland China, South Korea and Southeast Asia, said 
Leung at the customs department. Hong Kong is also a conduit for shipping 
the goods into other markets including Taiwan and Singapore, he said. 
Singapore officials, fearing hard times will prompt people to buy 
fakes, launched a pre-Christmas campaign featuring the slogan: ``Stop 
piracy! Be original! Buy original!'' In the first 10 months of 1998, 
Hong Kong customs officials arrested 619 people and seized countefeits 
worth 45 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.8 million). But cracking 
down on piracy is difficult, Leung said. Because Hong Kong is a relatively 
small market, many copyright holders won't spend the money to sue 
pirates here. The government can do little without their help, Leung 
said. ``It is extremely easy to take a person to court. But how to 
prove to the court that the goods are fake is extremely difficult,'' 
Leung said. At least one company is fighting back. Wave Licensing 
International, which handles British Teletubbies products in Hong 
Kong, hired investigators to find people selling bogus products resembling 
the pudgy characters from the BBC kids show. Visiting Belgian exporter 
Bart Pillart was excited to find some talking ``Telotubbies'' on Temple 
Street _ despite their low quality. ``Hey, it's shaped like a Teletubbie, 
it makes noises and it looks like a Teletubbie,'' Pillart said. The 
toy is now headed to his 3-year-old daughter's Christmas stocking.
