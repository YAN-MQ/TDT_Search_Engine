Rescuing the peace accord will not be easy. The violence in the region 
has not let up during the president's visit. Today on the West Bank, 
Israeli soldiers clashed with Palestinians. As Sam reported, the president 
heads to Gaza tomorrow, and ABC's Gillian findlay is there. Mention 
the name Bill Clinton in the crowded squalid refugee camps of Gaza 
and you'll get a response that might surprise you. He understand Palestinian 
problem more than other president. This is a place that used to burn 
American flags, today they are raising them, celebrating Mr. Clinton 
and priding themselves on what they call their new partnership with 
the United States. It feels like it's the first time for the Americans 
to stand beside the palestinians. In part, it's the afterglow of the 
peace agreement Mr. Clinton brokered. Here was the man known as the 
most pro-Israel president ever, listening carefully to the Palestinian 
leaders, sometimes siding with them against israel. That was followed 
by a U.S.-sponsored international donors conference that raised the 
Palestinians billions of dollars in foreign aid. And then there is 
the belief among Palestinians that the Clintons, plural, understand 
their dream of a state. The first lady said as much in a satellite 
address to school children back in may. I think that it will be in 
the long-term interest the Middle East for pal stein to be a state. 
While U.S. officials at the time were quick to call her controversial 
remarks personal opinions, Palestinians were thrilled. After her declaration 
that she supporting a Palestinian state, I think she's even more popular 
than Clinton himself. But even on the eve of the visit, that popularity 
has limits. This is still one of the poorest places on earth, peace 
hasn't changed that. Nor does everyone feel that the president's historic 
trip is motivated by concern for Palestinians. The visit will help 
Clinton after his problem with Monica, so I feel it's for his propaganda. 
Nevertheless, when Mr. Clinton lands his helicopter at Gaza's new 
international airport tomorrow, he'll be treated to a hero's welcome. 
Palestinians are reading a lot into this visit and expecting a lot 
in the future. Gillian Findlay, ABC News, Gaza.
