For Cyprus and 10 East European nations hoping to join the European 
Union, the picture can get fuzzy: If the EU has a road map for its 
largest expansion ever, why is this ride so bumpy? Nine years after 
the Berlin Wall fell, the East Europeans still get lofty declarations 
about a new Europe but no sense when they'll be part of it. The 15 
EU leaders ended a two-day summit Saturday, again declaring their 
eastward expansion _ membership talks began this fall _ remains on 
track but still setting no entry dates. First, they said, the EU leaders 
must end by March a fight over how to finance enlargement and slash 
farm spending which consumes half the EU budget and has escaped even 
minor cost-cutting since 1957. Then the EU must reform its housekeeping 
rules that promise decision-making gridlock when Cyprus and 10 East 
European nations join. These reforms have been fruitlessly debated 
for years. ``European integration is a marathon, not a sprint,'' Romanian 
President Emil Constantinescu said after he and other eastern leaders 
met with their EU colleagues. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
remained confident the EU can settle its internal problems by March. 
His country, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark seek a spending 
freeze, keeping outlays at 85 billion European currency units (about 
dlrs 100 billion) in the 2000-2006 period. Spain and other southerners 
_ seeing EU funds going east at their expense _ push for budget growth 
in line with economic growth, adding some dlrs 24 billion to the EU 
budget by 2006. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said that 
showed rich-poor solidarity. Retorted Schroeder: ``Germany has no 
unlimited resources (and) expects the curve of its financial contribution 
to rise no more but to start pointing downward.'' Germany and some 
of its neighbors pay more into the EU than they get back. They want 
overpayments _ 22 billion marks (dlrs 13 billion) a year in Germany's 
case _ capped somehow. The EU is no stranger to 11th hour haggling 
over money and other issues. The resulting image is often one of an 
outfit that makes things up as it goes along. After years of preparing 
for a single currency, the EU leaders argued for 12 hours at a summit 
in Brussels last May over who should be the European Central Bank 
chief. After years of disagreements, the EU will craft a common defense 
independent from Washington but within NATO. This is supposed to shore 
up a shaky EU foreign policy, coordinated by someone whose name was 
not announced here because the EU leaders must yet agree on who it 
should be. In 1991, the EU ended duty-free sales by 1999, declaring 
them incompatible with a single market Europe. Here, the leaders agreed 
to review and possibly reverse that decision. The EU wants to enlarge 
but must still figure out how to finance that. Schroeder spoke of 
a March deal on farm and budget reforms. French President Jacques 
Chirac spoke of a deal by June. The EU wants to enlarge but sets no 
entry dates saying that will make candidates stop working on economic 
reforms to get ready for membership. Slovenian Prime Minister Janez 
Drnovsek complained the West Europeans want candidates to be ready 
for membership fast yet sets no finish line. ``This should be done 
in a parallel way,'' he complained. ``We haven't heard anything about 
a timetable (for joining),'' Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said. 
``In the future it will be necessary.'' The EU stance upsets Latvia, 
Lithuania and Slovakia the most. These three are in a slow track to 
membership but have been scurrying to meet conditions for joining. 
Despite a recommendation from the EU head office, the EU leaders declined 
to advance them to the fast negotiating track.
