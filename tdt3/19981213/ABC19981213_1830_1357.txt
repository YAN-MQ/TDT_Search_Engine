Morris K. udall, a 30-year veteran of Congress and one of its most 
outspoken liberal voices, has died. Udall died late yesterday in Washington 
after a long battle with parkinson's disease. Udall, who was always 
known as "Mo," represented the state of Arizona for three decades. 
He was an ardent defender of the environment. In 1996, udall's son 
accepted the presidential medal of freedom on his father's behalf. 
Today, President Clinton called udall "A leader of uncommon wisdom, 
wit and dedication." It may be the wit that he is most remembered 
for. I know it's tough, but remember the old politician's prayer which 
say, "O lord, teach us to utter words that are gentle and tender, 
because tomorrow we may have to eat them." Udall was 76.
