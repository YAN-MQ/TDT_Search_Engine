President Hosni Mubarak and his Congolese counterpart Laurent Kabila 
discussed Sunday a possible role for Egypt in mediating an end to 
the four-month civil war in Congo, government sources said. The sources, 
speaking on customary condition of anonymity, declined to give details. 
Kabila arrived here Saturday and is scheduled to leave Egypt Monday. 
Kabila refuses to negotiate peace directly with the Congolese rebels, 
backed by Rwanda and Uganda. The rebels, a coalition of disaffected 
Congolese soldiers and opposition politicians, accuse Kabila of corruption 
and ethnic favoritism. Kabila, who is back by Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad 
and Namibia, alleges the rebels are merely pawns of neighboring Rwanda 
and Uganda and insists on negotiating only with those two countries.
