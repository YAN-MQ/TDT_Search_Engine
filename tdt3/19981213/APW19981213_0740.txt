BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors visited 25 places Sunday on the 
last day of their current round of search for Iraq's illegal weapons, 
Iraqi and U.N. officials said. Ten groups of experts of the United 
Nations Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
carried out 25 surprise and scheduled checks, the official Iraqi News 
Agency said. It quoted Gen. Hussam Mohammed Amin, head of the Iraqi 
National Monitoring Directorate, as saying that two of the teams used 
helicopters. No details were provided. Amin's office liaises with 
UNSCOM and IAEA, which are responsible for dismantling Iraq's banned 
programs for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long range 
missiles. Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of these weapons, 
U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot 
be lifted. UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said most of the visiting 
40 inspectors left the country on Sunday and the rest will leave Monday. 
Up to 140 resident experts will, however, remain in Iraq to monitor 
previously inspected sites to ensure that Iraq does not use them for 
illegal purposes. INA quoted Amin as saying that Roger Hill, the Australian 
who led the inspections this week, also left with the others for Bahrain 
Sunday, the day he was planning to carry out a check. Hill did not 
explain to the Iraqis ``the reasons behind cutting short his visit 
and the sudden return to Bahrain,'' Amin was quoted as saying. This 
week's searches have been the most intensive since last month when 
Iraq allowed UNSCOM to resume its work that was halted in August. 
Iraq recapitulated only hours before the United States had planned 
to launch military strikes on Nov. 14. President Saddam Hussein's 
government also pledged full cooperation to the inspectors, and the 
latest searches are seen as a test of that. Chief weapons inspector 
Richard Butler is expected to report soon on the level of Iraqi cooperation 
to the U.N. Security Council. Iraqi newspapers on Sunday accused Butler 
of prolonging the inspections and the sanctions. Butler's ``aggressive 
policy toward Iraq'' is aimed at undermining Iraq's independence, 
said al-Thawra daily, a government newspaper. ``The continuation of 
the Commission's work means the continuation of sanctions and plotting 
against Iraq,'' said the pro-government al-Qadissiya daily in an editorial.
