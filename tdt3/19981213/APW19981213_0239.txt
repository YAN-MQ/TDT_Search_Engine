Asian Games officials announced Saturday that they are opening up 
more ticket booths to help meet the demand for tickets after disturbances 
at Thailand's soccer matches. ``We must reduce the pressure outside 
the stadium,'' said Dr. Sakchye Tupsuwan, chairman of the Asian Games 
Technical Committee. Thailand plays South Korea Monday in a quarterfinal 
match in the Asian Games soccer tournament. Officials were responding 
to Saturday's near riot as 20,000 ticketless fans stormed the stadium 
and threw bottles, cans and shoes after tickets sold out in an hour. 
Four new outlets downtown and Rajamangala National Stadium were given 
more tickets to sell in advance for Thailand's game against South 
Korea, one of the best teams in the tournament. Organizers say they 
are dealing with the situation in the most appropriate manner. ``We 
are trying to solve this problem, but it is difficult, particularly 
with football,'' said Kanis Isadul, a member of the ticketing subcommittee. 
Isadul added that there would be a limit of five tickets per person. 
The limit was set to cut down on the number of scalpers outside the 
stadium. For those still unable to get tickets, the Sports Authority 
is installing a large mobile television screen outside the stadium. 
``It is probably the only one in Thailand. If we find any ore, we 
will get them,'' Sakchye said. However, with Monday's game expected 
to be another sell-out, officials continued to urge people to stay 
home and watch the soccer on their own televisions. ``What could be 
better,'' said Sakchye, `` than to stay home and sip some whiskey 
or tea?''
