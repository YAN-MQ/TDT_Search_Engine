This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for today and on into Monday. An area of low pressure has 
produced some heavy rains in the southeastern United States, it's 
going to move very slowly off the coast. In fact, some clouds and 
showers could linger right on through Monday, and perhaps even into 
Tuesday, right along the coastline. High pressure builds into New 
England and into the western gulf of Mexico, with generally quiet 
weather. A strong front is pushing across the Rockies and into the 
northern plains by Monday evening. It will produce rain and mountain 
snow. It produced some freezing rain in parts of the northwest on 
Saturday. As we look ahead into Tuesday, you can see that there will 
be generally quiet weather across much of the nation with rain in 
the northwest, some snow showers over the upper midwest and some lingering 
showers in the southeast, as I said. Temperatures mostly from the 
30s to 50s, but warmer in the south. Looking ahead to Wednesday, still 
some snow showers around the Great Lakes, and then Thursday it gets 
wetter across the northeast, with some showers in the northwest. Don't 
forget, four-day forecasts at CNN.com.
