Many moviegoers are moving at warp speed to the theaters this weekend 
for the debut of the ninth "star trek" movie. Anna Hovind looks at 
that and more in "now showing." You are participating in the outright 
theft of a world. They were never meant to be immortal. Who are we 
to determine the cause of evolution of these people. The crew of the 
starship "enterprise" takes to space again in "Star trek: insurrection." 
Captain Jean-Luc Picard discovers the federation may be trying to 
eliminate an entire race. We're only moving 600 people. We'll be able 
to help billions. This is the moment we planned for so many years. 
How many people does it take before it becomes wrong? Picard may have 
to disobey direct orders. Looks like you're planning on doing some 
hunting. Return to your quarters. That's an order. No uniform, no 
orders. The environmental anomolies may have stimulated rebellious 
Inc. Stiptings which could affect everyone's judgment except mine 
of course. What do you think we should do? Saddle up, lock and load. 
"star trek: insurrection" is rated "pg." Oh my God, look at this. 
Those are hundred dollar bills. I bet it's drug money. Bill Paxton 
and Billy Bob thronton Hatch what they think is "A simple plan." They 
find millions of dollars in the wreckage of a small plane, and they 
decide to keep it. $4 million. Look how square it is. But soon, their 
plan starts to unravel. We'll skate right through. Man from the FBI 
is going to be driving through. Seems they're looking for a lost plane. 
"A simple plan" is rated "R." I'm home. It's me, dad. What? Michael 
Keaton is "Jack frost," who comes back to life as one cool daddy. 
In life, he didn't have much time to spend with his son Charlie. Now, 
he is trying to melt the barriers between them. Charlie's run away 
with a snowman. Really. What's the snowman look like? That I, that's 
my branch. "Jack frost" is rated "pg." Thanks for giving me a second 
chance to be your dad. With "now showing," I'm Anna Hovind.
