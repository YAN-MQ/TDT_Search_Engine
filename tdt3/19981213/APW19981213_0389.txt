The speaker of the Iranian Parliament said Sunday that U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's planned visit to Gaza was part of a ``dangerous conspiracy,'' 
the official news agency reported. Clinton, who arrived in Israel 
late Saturday, plans to visit the Gaza Strip Monday and address the 
Palestine National Council. The council is to remove clauses from 
the Palestinian charter that call for Israel's destruction _ something 
Iran has rebuked. ``This very dangerous and ominous conspiracy will 
be materialized by the trip of the U.S. president to the occupied 
lands and attending a meeting of the so-called Palestine National 
Council,'' Iran's hard-line speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, told a 
Parliament session. The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Nateq-Nouri 
as saying Clinton's presence at the PNC would be ``great catastrophe.'' 
Iran does not recognize Israel and believes it was built on land belonging 
to the Palestinians.
