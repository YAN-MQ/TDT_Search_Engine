Paul J. Manafort, a former mayor here in the hometown of Rep. Nancy 
L. Johnson, hoped to help shape his fellow Republican's vote on whether 
to impeach President Clinton. Manafort, a mentor when she started 
in local politics 25 years ago, insists that the president committed 
perjury when he used language so tortured ``he makes Yogi Berra look 
like an English professor.'' But the last thing Manafort would do 
is call Mrs. Johnson. ``She looks at the commas and the dots and has 
a mind of her own,'' he said. ``If you try to tell her what to do, 
you're not on her list no more.'' So instead, Manafort, 75, passed 
his views around the Elks lodge and drugstore, hoping they would get 
back to her. And so went the tricky and _ according to the participants, 
probably futile _ enterprise of trying to lobby Mrs. Johnson, whose 
staff said she was still weighing her vote today. She is a moderate 
Republican who represents a largely Democratic district, which has 
sometimes made for a lonely road at home and on the Hill, but which 
makes her a much-courted player on close votes. ``Conservatives call 
her a liberal, and liberals call her a conservative,'' said Thomas 
J. Meskill, a Republican who was the governor of Connecticut from 
1971 to 1975 and once held Mrs. Johnson's seat in Congress. One way 
to escape arm-twisting is to go on a fact-finding trip to Australia 
and New Zealand, which Mrs. Johnson did last week. The calls about 
impeachment poured in to her offices at about 200 a day last week, 
initially two-thirds of them in favor but becoming more balanced as 
the week passed, according to her staff. The nuances of her views 
were so closely held that the letters piled up without even a form 
response until after she announced her view. The Sixth District includes 
Democratic strongholds like New Britain, an immigrant town 50 years 
past its manufacturing heyday as ``The Hardware City,'' but stretches 
northwest to the luscious weekend retreats of Litchfield County. Mrs. 
Johnson, 63, who has represented the area since 1983, is known at 
home as an independent idealist. In Washington, she shows her genes 
as the daughter of a Chicago politician by cutting savvy deals with 
Republican leaders, whom she has supported at crucial junctures. Many 
Republican activists in the district pressured her to vote for impeachment. 
``I told her Washington office that there's many members of our committee 
that will not support her if she doesn't vote for impeachment,'' said 
David R. Moulton, the Republican town chairman of Barkhamsted. ``I 
know she's got the big cities to worry about, but in the small towns 
we're watching her closely.'' Lisa R. Carver, a member of the Republican 
State Central Committee, said she suspects that with new Republican 
leaders taking over the House in January, Mrs. Johnson will want to 
break from the pack to win deference. But Ms. Carver said she hoped 
Mrs. Johnson would pick some other issue for that, and vote to impeach. 
``This one has to come from your gut, not from your head,'' Ms. Carver 
said. The opposite advice poured out Saturday night from New Britain 
High School parents who gathered for a medieval-themed banquet staged 
by the school's madrigal choir. The students played roles like ``Lady 
Linda Who Trips'' for a play in which King Henry VIII, accused of 
killing his wives, asks, ``What do you mean by murder?'' During the 
prime-rib feast, ``Sir Ken of Starr'' bustled among the tables, taking 
notes on the diners. Even as their sons and daughters mocked the president, 
most of their parents expressed visceral opposition to impeachment. 
``I feel like I have no representation _ it's frightening,'' said 
Cathy Kellar, 48, a clinical social worker. ``Congress is just digging 
its hole deeper.'' Richard E. Rosol, 48, an English professor, said 
Republicans in Congress seem to resent the president's success. ``Their 
vindictiveness has given birth to self-righteousness,'' he said. Just 
then, a male student wearing a blue dress and a beret crossed the 
stage chanting, ``Pizza for Bill! Pizza for Bill!''
