Low clouds and patchy light rain or drizzle will persist over much 
of the Tennessee Valley and Southeast coast where moist breezes from 
the Northeast prevail. Winds will be gusty at times near the Carolina 
and Georgia coasts as low pressure lingers offshore. Clouds will begin 
to break later Monday over the western Tennessee and southern Mississippi 
Valleys as drier winds from the north develop. Gusty winds from the 
Northwest will gradually subside from the New England to the Middle 
Atlantic coast as high pressure moves east from the Ohio Valley. Clouds 
and a few flurries will occur over the mountains of northern New England, 
especially Monday morning. Otherwise, plenty of sunshine and near 
seasonal temperatures will prevail in most of the Northeast. Unseasonably 
mild air will surge from the Plains into the western Great Lakes. 
Afternoon temperatures will average 10 to 20 degrees above normal 
over a large area from the east slopes of the northern Rockies to 
the northern Mississippi Valley. Sunshine will be abundant in most 
areas. Seasonably cold air will arrive over the interior West on gusty 
winds from the Northwest. Intermittent snow will fall along west-facing 
slopes of the northern and central Rockies. A potent jet stream disturbance 
with limited moisture will bring scattered snow to northern Nevada 
and Utah. The West Coast states will be mainly dry as high pressure 
strengthens over Oregon. Strong winds will develop across California, 
especially near the mountain passes. Focus: Wettest Year Despite a 
worsening drought due to a parched autumn in parts of the interior 
Northeast, a new annual precipitation record was set at Burlington, 
Vt., this weekend. A few showers on Friday pushed the 1998 total to 
50.18 inches of rain and melted snow, eclipsing the previous record 
set in 1983. The annual average is only 34.47 inches. The year began 
with a devastating ice storm that helped lead to Burlington's wettest 
January on record. Frequent downpours continued during the warm season, 
contributing to the lakeside city's wettest July as well as its wettest 
summer on record.
