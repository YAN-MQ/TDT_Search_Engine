pain relievers... may irritate your stomach while others won't? no. 
I just know aspirin can do that sometimes. Different kind of medicine? 
Good guess. There are two kinds of over-the-counter pain relievers. 
One type is called NSAIDs... which include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen 
sodium... to name a few, and every single nsaid, to varying degrees, 
including even ibuprofen, can sometimes irritate your stomach... by 
interfering with the production of the substance... that lines and 
protects the stomach. And surprisingly, this irritation can occur... 
at the stomach lining without you even feeling it. The other type 
of pain reliever is the medicine in Tylenol. Tylenol won't irritate 
your stomach the way NSAIDs, like aspirin or even ibuprofen, sometimes 
can. That's one reason why doctors recommend it most. So take care 
of your pain and take care of your stomach. Tylenol house call is 
brought to you... by extra strength Tylenol.
