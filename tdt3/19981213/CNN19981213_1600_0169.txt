The questions about the president's political future come as he's 
involved in the Middle East. Mr. Clinton is trying to restore momentum 
to the peace accord negotiated two months ago at wye river, Maryland. 
Andrea Koppel reports. Day one of President Clinton's mideast trip 
brought neither a Breakthrough on the stalled land for security agreement 
nor did it provide mr. Clinton a break from what awaits him when he 
returns home. Mr. president, how confident are you that you can avoid 
impeachment in the full house next week? I don't know what's going 
to happen. That's up to them. It's out of my hands. So too is the 
future of the wye agreement, according to Israel's prime minister. 
His own political future in jeopardy, Mr. Netanyahu told reporters 
he won't hand over any more land, because he says the Palestinians 
haven't fulfilled their part of the wye agreement. In the sphere of 
security, and ending incitement and violence, and the repeal of the 
Palestinian charter, and in commitments to negotiate a final settlement, 
I regret to say that none of these conditions have been met. On the 
eve of President Clinton's arrival in Gaza, Palestinians are hoping 
the first American president to visit a Palestinian-controlled area 
will give a boost to their claim for a Palestinian state. They also 
hope it will succeed in putting the now stalled peace agreement back 
on track. Palestinian sources tell CNN that the Palestinian national 
council will vote with a show of hands on Monday day. It could play 
a significant role in pushing the peace process forward. No one expected 
Mr. Clinton's fourth trip to Israel to be an easy one. After paying 
his respects at the gravesite of the Israeli prime minister who was 
assassinated in 1995, the U.S. president joined the iz rally president 
to Mark the beginning of hanukkah, the Jew wish festival of lights. 
A miracle happened here. But short of a miracle, sources say the resolution 
is still "very much up in the air." Andrea Koppel, CNN, Jerusalem.
