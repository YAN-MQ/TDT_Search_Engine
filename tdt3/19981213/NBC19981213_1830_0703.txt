at the very core of the struggle in the middle east is jerusalem. 
as nbc's martin fletcher reports, it is the emotional heartland to 
israeli and palestinian alike. jerusalem -- holy to muslims, christians 
and jews, celebrated as the city of peace. but it has been fought 
over and conquered 37 times in 4,000 years, the last time by israel. 
and today, peace is as elusive as ever. we have only one jerusalem 
in the whole world. it's very important that the muslims do not occupy 
it. it is a place which is dear for everyone, as palestinians. we 
consider it as our national capital. the battle for jerusalem is fought 
stone by stone, house by house. this building in east jerusalem was 
a synagogue until 50 years ago, when arabs took over. today the jews 
have reclaimed it. outside, the battle rages. palestinians protest 
the return of the jews, afraid that more will come, which is exactly 
what these right-wing israelis want. i hope that soon we'll have here 
again a lively jewish neighborhood. jerusalem is the most sensitive, 
the most passionate issue that divides israelis and palestinians. 
it's also one of the next issues on the agenda of the peace process. 
each side is warning there will be no compromise, whatever the cost. 
jerusalem has left its scars on many people, on their bodies and on 
their minds. nurit peled elhanan -- right now it's a city of hate 
and bloodshed. last year, three suicide bombers blew themselves up 
among a crowd of shoppers on a busy jerusalem street. they killed 
five, wounded almost 200. among the dead -- smadar, nurit's 14-year-old 
daughter. today, the street is packed again. but nurit won't come 
here. the center of jerusalem? you can't go there? no, i don't go 
to many places, because i am scared, yes. for some the city of peace 
has become a city of fear, but the peace process gives some hope to 
nurit. if they get wiser with the years, maybe they will make a cosmopolitan 
city out of it for the christians and everybody who is here, and then 
you may say that it could be a city of peace and friendship and love. 
to which most people here can only say amen. martin fletcher, nbc, 
jerusalem.
