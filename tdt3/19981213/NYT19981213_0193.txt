There was a peculiar symmetry between the locker rooms at Giants Stadium 
before and after Sunday's game. Before the game, the high-flying Denver 
Broncos were aspiring to make National Football League history, rumbling 
toward posterity. The young, struggling Giants were grasping for a 
slim playoff hope, but were really playing for respectability. Afterward, 
they occupied dramatically different worlds. In the Giants' locker 
room, wide receiver Amani Toomer basked in the glory of a game-winning 
37-yard touchdown pass. Down the dark concrete corridor in the visitors' 
lockerroom, Tito Paul, the 26-year-old defensive back whom Toomer 
beat on the play, sat in front of his locker. Head down, chin buried 
in his chest, Paul blamed himself for everything from losing sight 
of Toomer to not going up more aggressively for the ball. Paul sat 
there for 45 minutes, answering questions, trying to put the loss 
in perspective, as teammates came by and patted him on the back, whispered 
encouragement or simply ignored him. ``There's no consolation,'' he 
said. ``I know we have 11 guys out there, but everybody's expected 
to do their job. I didn't hold up my end.'' The Broncos' winning streak, 
which ended at 18 games with their 20-16 loss to the Giants, had become 
part of their lives, their identity. ``You can't help it,'' said Tyrone 
Braxton, the veteran defensive back. ``Every day, every week people 
ask you about the streak, it becomes a part of you.'' Denver had not 
lost a game in nearly a year, not since a 34-17 loss to San Francisco 
last Dec. 15. Now Mike Shanahan, the Broncos' head coach, was asked 
about the play that ended Denver's dream of a perfect season. ``We 
all saw the same thing,'' he said. ``The guy threw it up in the air 
and their receiver made a play and our defensive back did not.'' For 
players, for a franchise _ and for television networks _ Paul's misplay 
looms larger than a mere bad play that loses a game. Denver was steaming 
toward posterity. No team except the 1972 Miami Dolphins had gone 
undefeated. The Broncos needed three more victories to complete a 
perfect regular season. What a great encore to a Super Bowl championship. 
ABC was looking forward to next Monday night's game between Denver 
and Miami. Shannon Sharpe, the Broncos tight end, admitted that he 
had not expected the streak to end at Giants Stadium. ``They're a 
good young team, a quality team,'' Sharpe said. ``But no, I wouldn't 
have thought it would end here. Not like this.'' Terrell Davis, the 
Broncos running back, was so ill when he woke up on Sunday that he 
thought he would not play. ``I thought there was a 90 percent chance 
I wouldn't play,'' Davis said. ``I couldn't lift my bag to get out 
of the room. It took so much energy just to pack my bag and carry 
it down to the team meeting.'' Davis carried 28 times for 147 yards. 
The winning streak, which ended one game short of the NFL record, 
might have been the underlying reason for the loss. Steve Atwater, 
the veteran safety, said the Broncos may have been seduced by the 
specter of setting a record. The Broncos had not played well the previous 
three weeks; Atwater said the team was preparing for the streak and 
not the opposition. ``That was the problem; we weren't focused on 
winning, we were focused on 14-0,'' he said. ``Sure you practice and 
all of that, but in the back of your mind, the only thing you're thinking 
about is the outcome of the game, not the job at hand.'' Atwater said 
he hadn't said anything, ``because we were still winning, but play 
was getting a little sloppy on game day.'' Linebacker Bill Romanowski 
had noticed the same thing. ``The things you look for are, (a) how 
did we practice, and (b) how was our focus in practice, our attention 
to detail,'' he said. ``We had good practices last week. It didn't 
carry over into the game. There wasn't a sense of urgency out there. 
That's what it takes every single down. It wasn't there today.'' Atwater 
added: ``People are talking about the Super Bowl. We've still got 
two regular-season games to play and two playoff games. It's crazy 
to be talking about the Super Bowl.'' Nearly an hour after the game, 
the visitors' locker room was practically deserted. A member of the 
Broncos media relations staff encouraged Paul, as compassionately 
as possible, to get dressed: he had given up the touchdown; now don't 
compound the problem by holding up the team bus. Paul pulled on his 
shoes, his tweed jacket. He checked to make sure he hadn't left anything 
more than hurt pride in his dressing stall. Defensive backs, like 
gunners in basketball, generally have short memories. ``I won't be 
forgetting about this soon,'' he sighed. He walked out, past the friends 
and families of the Giants he had made so happy. The streak was over. 
The Broncos had lost a bit of luster; now they're just another good 
team trying to reach the Super Bowl. While Toomer's world reverberated 
with cheers, all Paul would hear was Shanahan's blunt analysis. ``Their 
receiver made a play,'' he said, ``and our defensive back did not.''
