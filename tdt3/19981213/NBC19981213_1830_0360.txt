one of the still undeclared house members represents the people of 
iowa's first congressional district. nbc's pat dawson is in cedar 
rapids tonight. iowa's first congressional district, a patchwork of 
neat farms and modest homes, twice voted to put president clinton 
in the white house. at the lutheran church this sunday, there was 
more talk about punishment than forgiveness. i would like to see him 
impeached. i would encourage a vote for impeachment. the president 
should be impeached. but i would leave it up to his discretion because 
that's what i elected him to office to do. their congressman, jim 
leitch, has represented this district for 20 years, a moderate with 
a streak of independence. calls to his office here are running 2-1 
in favor of impeachment. iowaans know that congressman leech is a 
serious representative. they know that he is dedicated to making sure 
thatel votes his conscience. tracy pratt voiced her opinion by e-mail. 
i should would appreciate it, if he would not vote along political 
partisan lines. one doesn't have to search too long here before the 
word values comes up. people here tend to be more conservative and 
care about family values. this could be divisive for the country. 
voters made it clear they were offended by the president's actions 
but many feel the cost of impeachment is too high. a complicated message 
that isn't likely to make a tough political choice easier. pat dawson, 
nbc news, cedar rapids, iowa.
