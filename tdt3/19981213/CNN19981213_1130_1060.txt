It's Sunday, and that can only mean one thing -- pro football. Details 
up next, in "CNN Headline Sports." These days, seems like everybody's 
got a Cherokee or an explorer. me? I like to stand out a bit. That's 
why I drive a Subaru outback. With a big cargo bay and all-wheel drive, 
you get all the sport-utility you need. With a smooth ride and better 
gas mileage, the outback is far from ordinary. Like me, really. What 
a weird looking bunch that was. Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports."
