Olympic gold medalist Catriona LeMay Doan looked set to sweep the 
women's sprints, but after a minor mishap in the final race Sunday, 
had to settle for three of four possible golds at the Nagano World 
Cup speedskating championship. Competing in the 1,000 meters after 
winning the 500 in the second round of the two-day event, the 27-year-old 
Canadian had to slow down, missing a few strokes, to let Eriko Sanmiya 
of Japan switch into the outside lane. Sanmiya admitted she was at 
fault. ``It happened either because I was too slow as the starter 
on the inside lane or Catriona was too fast and almost caught me up 
at the switching point,'' said Sanmiya. ``I feel very sorry that it 
might have cost her a medal,'' she added. The two were attempting 
their fourth 1-2 finish in the same twosome, with Sanmiya seeking 
her fourth silver in two days. After the setback, LeMay Doan finished 
fifth in 1 minute, 18.88 seconds, 0.97 second off the pace. Sanmiya 
was 16th with an unimpressive time of 1:19.94. On Saturday, the Canadian 
star skated 1:18.07 for the gold and the Japanese skater 1:19.49 for 
the silver. LeMay Doan also took the gold in the 500 on Saturday. 
No complaint was filed by the Canadians with the organizers. ``When 
I apologized to Catriona after the race, she told me not to worry. 
``Don't worry. No problem,'' she said apparently trying to comfort 
me,'' Sanmiya said. Tonny de Jong, a 5,000-meter specialist from the 
Netherlands, set her personal best of 1:17.91 for the gold in her 
first ever competition in a World Cup 1,000 meters. But the Canadians 
won the team's fourth overall gold anyway. Canada's Jeremy Wotherspoon 
took the men's 500 meters after Olympic gold medalist and world record 
holder Hiroyasu Shimizu fell while negotiating a corner. Shimizu, 
winner of the event Saturday, had the day's fastest lap time of 9.64 
seconds for the first 100 meters before he fell and slammed into the 
protective wall. Shimizu suffered minor contusion on the elbow and 
the thigh, his staff said. His race partner in the final twosome, 
Wotherspoon, sped alone to victory in 35.85 seconds. The Canadian 
was the silver medalist Friday. Olympic silver medalist Jan Bos gave 
the Netherlands the day's fourth gold with a victory in the men's 
1,000 meters. He also won the event on Saturday. Bos said the Netherlands, 
long a powerhouse in long-distance races, is now putting as much emphasis 
on shorter races under the influence and program of Peter Mueller, 
an American coach the country hired one and a half years ago. ``From 
the beginning it started well and he has a really good program,'' 
said the 22-year-old Bos. ``He has built a team of harmony and good 
atmosphere _ we have a lot of fun together _ and we train very hard.'' 
With Mueller at the helm, the Dutch excelled in both the 500-meter 
and 1,000-meter events at the Olympics at Nagano. The two-day event 
was the first of five short-race World Cups for the 1998-1999 season. 
Two rounds of 500- and 1,000-meter competition were staged both for 
women and men.
