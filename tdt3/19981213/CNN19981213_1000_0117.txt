Published reports suggest an intense lobbying effort is going on at 
the White House, now that the Judiciary committee has finished its 
work. The president's staff is concentrating its efforts on 30 undecided 
members of Congress who hold the key to Mr. Clinton's fate. An informal 
survey by CNN finds the White House needs to win at least 20 of their 
votes to avoid impeachment later this week, and at least nine of those 
votes must come from republicans. One of those wavering members is 
congressman Scott klug. I think you have to separate your feelings 
for Bill Clinton, the president, versus your feelings about the presidency, 
because this vote is going to have a lot of significance 20 and 25 
years down the road, and I think all of us are trying to figure out 
how you balance those competing interests between understanding that 
the rule of law's important, even more so for, then for anybody, the 
president, it's got to apply to him. But I also at this at the same 
time, you have to worry if we act too precipitously. And that's a 
tough balancing act. Avoiding impeachment could become even more difficult 
for Mr. Clinton, if house democrats can't get a censure resolution 
to the floor. Incoming house speaker Bob Livingston is reportedly 
opposed to such a Motion. But minority leader Dick Gephardt is drafting 
a letter to him, demanding one.
