Lu Hsiao-chuan shot an even-par 72 Sunday for a 288 total, leading 
a Taiwanese sweep of the top three places in Asian Games golf. Japan's 
Tomohiro Kondo also finished with 72 for a 4-under total of 284 and 
the men's golf gold. He finished one shot ahead of the Philippines' 
Gerald Rosales. Taiwan also won the women's team gold, and Japan was 
the men's team champion. Despite the Taiwanese sweep of the top women's 
places, South Korea's Jang Jeong took the bronze with a 291 total 
after a 73 Sunday because Asian Games rules limit medal to two per 
country in any event. Lu gained her one-shot victory with a birdie 
on the par-4 16th and a last-hole bogey by teammate Wei Jun-jye, who 
shot 73-289 for the silver. Taiwan's Lin Yu-ping, who bogeyed the 
par-5 17th, missed out on an individual medal despite her 72-290. 
Lin still shared in the team gold, which Taiwan won with 575 to 585 
for South Korea and 596 for the Philippines. Kondo's victory came 
after Rosales bogeyed the par-5 14th hole and Kondo birdied the par-3 
15th. Japan's Hidemasa Hoshino took the bronze with a 286, one shot 
behind Rosales, after a final-round 70. Japan won the team gold with 
862 to 866 for the Philippines and 872 for Taiwan, whose Hong Chai-yuh 
shot 69 Sunday, leaving him two shots out of the individual medals 
at 288.
