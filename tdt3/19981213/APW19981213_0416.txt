Defending the Russian government's plans to print more money in 1999, 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said paying workers on time is more 
important than propping up the ruble, a news report said Sunday. ``It 
is unbelievable sometimes when I hear that the most important thing 
now is to strengthen the ruble, even by delaying pensions and wages 
in the budget sector,'' Primakov said in an interview with the ORT 
television station on Saturday, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
Primakov was defending the government's draft budget for 1999, which 
calls for printing an additional dlrs 1.7 billion worth of rubles 
to cover part of a deficit equivalent to around dlrs 5 billion. Some 
economists believe the government will print far more. Before Russia's 
economic crisis hit in August, the ruble was trading at six to the 
dollar. It now stands at around 20 to the dollar, and is expected 
to continue falling. Russia faces mounting debts and falling revenues 
next year, and many government officials say the only way out is to 
print more cash. Russia's money supply has gone from about 160 billion 
rubles (dlrs 8 billion) when the crisis struck to more 190 billion 
rubles (dlrs 9.5 billion) Friday, according to government figures. 
Primakov said Russia should not have to depend on Western credits, 
as it has in the past. ``Why should we beg all the time,'' Primakov 
said. ``We must revive the real economy to create a sound foundation 
and build relations with people on this basis,'' he said.
