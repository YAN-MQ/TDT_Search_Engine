If you're looking for the perfect gift for the business traveler during 
this holiday season, you're in luck. Kalin Thomas-Samuel has some 
suggestions in this edition of "working ahead." Busy business travelers 
may be wishing Santa would give them some time off, but at least they 
can get a gift to make travel easier. What's great about travel accessories 
is that they're not only great as gifts for people who travel frequently, 
but they're also great for holiday travel. So they can be a gift to 
yourself, or a gift to others. Like the bucky neck pillows, for use 
in the car or on the plane. They're made from natural buckwheat hulls, 
and can even be microwaved to give your neck some extra comfort. These 
ear planes are designed to help alleviate the pain that can come with 
cabin pressure changes during takeoff and landing. There's a light 
attached to this fog umbrella, to help you navigate when it's dark 
and rainy. This is touted as the "smallest 35mm camera." It's small 
enough that you can actually put it into your shirt pocket. But don't 
let the size fool you. It uses 35mm film and takes panoramic pictures. 
Finally, there's the travel companion plus -- four products in one. 
It's a calendar, an alarm clock, and when you pull it apart, it becomes 
a Flashlight and a motion and smoke detector. This can actually Hang 
on the doorknob in your hotel room. Providing not only convenience, 
but peace of mind. Kalin Thomas-Samuel, CNN, Atlanta.
