As the full house prepares As the full house prepares for this week's 
historic vote, an unfamiliar face will preside over the proceedings. 
His name is Ray LaHood, and if you've never heard of him, you soon 
will. Here's ABC's Mike Von Fremd. Whether he likes it or not, congressman 
Ray LaHood, who has only been in office since 1995, is about to become 
a household name. The house will be in order. The gavel was passed 
to LaHood because his outgoing speaker Newt gingrich does not want 
to end his career presiding over impeachment, and incoming speaker 
Bob Livingston doesn't want to start his career that way. The speaker, 
Newt Gingrich and I agree that Mr. LaHood is an exemplary member of 
Congress who is able to reach across the aisle. Republican leaders 
think this man from peoria will play well with the nation, presiding 
over this week's impeachment vote. My responsibility in chairing the 
house will really be to make sure that it is done properly, according 
to the rules in a fashion where members feel like on both sides that 
something is not being ramrodded through. LaHood sharpened his legislative 
skills as a top aide to former house leader Bob Michael. The impeachment 
debate will likely be the ultimate test of keeping order, but LaHood's 
colleagues say he is unflappable. LaHood says he is not losing sleep 
over the upcoming challenge, but said he prayed in his peoria church 
today for guidance. I believe what the house does next week could 
can be the most historic proceedings this century in the House of 
Representatives. Democrats who would prefer that this process not 
take place at all grudgingly admit that if it has to, Ray LaHood is 
the sort of fair-minded republican who should preside. Mike Von Fremd, 
ABC News, Capitol Hill.
