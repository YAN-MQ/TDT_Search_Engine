JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton tried Sunday to repair 
the tattered Wye River peace accords with appeals to Israel and the 
Palestinians to implement the difficult land-for-security decisions 
they made two months ago. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
assured Clinton ``we are prepared to do our part.'' But he linked 
any further Israeli withdrawal on the West Bank to Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat renouncing his plans to declare statehood and taking 
steps to squelch violence. ``I'm sure that we can achieve peace between 
Palestinians and Israelis if we stand firm on Palestinian compliance,'' 
Netanyahu said. He urged Clinton to take that message to Arafat in 
Gaza on Monday. Clinton's three-day visit to the Middle East was initially 
designed to celebrate the peace accords he mediated along the Wye 
River of Maryland two months ago. But with the momentum for impeachment 
growing back home and the peace agreement threatened, the day took 
on a more somber tone. Responding to questions at a news conference, 
Clinton said he would not resign or admit perjury. Netanyahu, who 
faces his own political troubles, offered Clinton a hand. ``Your devotion 
to this cause, your perseverance, your timeless energy, your commitment, 
have been an inspiration to us all,'' he told the president. And as 
he stood by the president's side, he admonished reporters to focus 
on the matter at hand _ Mideast peacemaking _ rather than the impeachment 
drama. Clinton credited the Palestinian Authority with taking some 
``important steps,'' including deeper security cooperation with Israel 
and confiscating illegal weapons, but he was also critical. ``Have 
the Palestinians fulfilled all their commitments?'' he asked. ``They 
certainly could be doing better to preempt violent demonstrations 
in the street. This is a terribly important matter.'' Clinton renewed 
his pledge to ask Congress to provide dlrs 1.2 billion to help Israel 
take new security measures to carry out the Wye accords. This is in 
addition to the dlrs 3 billion a year in annual U.S. economic and 
military assistance that Israel gets. At the same time, he cautioned 
that Israel needed to reach out and not be preoccupied with security 
or live in a permanent state of siege. The Palestinians, he said in 
a speech to a mostly young audience at the Jerusalem Convention Center, 
``feel you should acknowledge they, too, have suffered and have legitimate 
expectations that should be met.'' ``And they are right, too,'' Clinton 
said. On Monday, in Gaza, with Clinton in attendance, the Palestine 
National Council is due to repeal articles of a founding charter that 
call for Israel's destruction. ``That will be a welcome development,'' 
Netanyahu said. However, he accused Arafat of gross violations of 
the Wye and other accords with Israel by declaring he would establish 
a Palestinian state unilaterally if he could not get one through negotiations. 
``I think no one can seriously expect Israel to hand over another 
inch of territory unless and until such an unambiguous correction 
is made,'' Netanyahu said. Recognizing that Netanyahu and Arafat are 
being pressed by critics of the accords they reached in the Wye negotiations, 
Clinton exhorted the two leaders to revive the cooperation that led 
to the accords. Officials held out the possibility of a three-way 
meeting. Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during 
the Clinton visit. At Clinton's hotel, 500 policemen were posted to 
guard the president and his delegation. Abdallah Shami, leader of 
the Islamic Jihad group in Gaza, said in an interview with APTN that 
he would kill Clinton if he could ``with every method I can muster.'' 
``I would not hesitate,'' Shami said. But, he said, ``I don't know 
of anybody in Gaza who is thinking of killing Clinton now.'' There 
was no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone throwers clashed 
with Israeli troops and an Israeli high school student was stabbed 
and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager. Two U.S. flags were burned 
at a rally attended by 2,000 followers of a radical PLO faction, the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which opposes the peace 
accords. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright underscored 
that the administration wanted Israel to take the next scheduled step 
in relinquishing more territory on the West Bank. ``We would like 
this timetable to get back on track,'' she said.
