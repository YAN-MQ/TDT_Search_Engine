Israeli warplanes fired rockets at suspected guerrilla positions in 
the southwestern Lebanon on Sunday. There were no immediate reports 
of casualties. Earlier, Israeli planes broke the sound barrier over 
Beirut, rattling windows of apartment buildings. Four Israeli jets 
fired 12 rockets at targets in the western sector of the Israeli-occupied 
southern Lebanon. An Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem said 
the jet pilots reported ``good hits'' and returned safely to their 
bases. The raids came a few hours after the Shiite Muslim militant 
group Hezbollah shelled an outpost of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon 
militia in Wadi Zellaya just north of the occupation zone. A Hezbollah 
spokesman in Beirut had no comment on the air raid, but the group 
said its fighters on the ground hit an Israeli Merkava tank with rockets 
in Iqlim al-Tuffah province, some 15 kilometers (9 miles) southeast 
of the southern city of Sidon. It gave no casualty figures. There 
was no Israeli confirmation of the attack on the tank. The Iranian-backed 
Hezbollah is trying to oust the 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 allied 
militiamen of the South Lebanon Army from the 1,100-square-kilometer 
(440-square-mile) occupation strip along the Lebanese-Israeli border.
