the impeachment showdown set in motion in washington is being waged 
across continents tonight. the target of it all, president clinton, 
is almost 6,000 miles away in jerusalem where the president was fighting 
on two fronts today -- nbc's claire shipman is traveling with the 
president. the two leaders were supposed to be holding a q&a on middle 
east peace, but most of the questions and answers concerned impeachment. 
and after months of dodging the subject, bill clinton discussed his 
fate directly, even defiantly. and an israeli reporter asked the big 
question. do you intend to resign? i will not resign. it has never 
even crossed my mind. the president had a definitive answer for those 
who have suggested he might save impeachment if he admitted to perjury. 
i can't do that, because i did not commit perjury. if you go back 
to the hearing, we had four prosecutors who went trough the law in 
great detail and explained that this is not a perjury case. and there 
was no credible argument on the other side. so i have no intention 
of doing that. now, was that testimony in the deposition difficult 
and ambiguous and unhelpful? yes, it was. that's exactly what i said 
in the grand jury testimony myself. clinton urged house members to 
vote their consciences. if any member wishes to talk to me or someone 
on my staff, we would make ourselves available to them. but otherwise, 
i think it's important that they be free to make this decision and 
that they not be put under pressure from any quarter. but back in 
washington, white house advisers are reaching out to any members they 
can find, at the very least to urge a censure alternative in the full 
house. and the same bill clinton who has said repeatedly these issues 
are up to congress, today showed a flash of anger at the idea censure 
might not be an option. that seems to be what three-quarters of the 
american people want. friends say the president is still stunned to 
be on the brink of impeachment, and he's intent on avoiding that mark 
on his record. two undeclared republican congressmen are with him 
on this trip. no word on whether anything they've heard has helped 
them decide how to vote. claire shipman, nbc news.
