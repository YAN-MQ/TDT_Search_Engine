At the mention of President Clinton's name, Sean Lewis can barely 
conceal his displeasure. ``It's hard to have any respect for Clinton,'' 
he said, ``and he certainly doesn't deserve any pity.'' But Lewis, 
a 32-year-old marketing director, fiercely opposes impeachment. ``The 
question is not what's best for Clinton, but what's best for the country,'' 
Lewis said. ``And it's not good for the country to go through an impeachment 
trial and maybe throw him out of office.'' This congressional district 
north of Chicago, with its lakefront mansions and elegant boutiques, 
leans heavily toward the Republican Party, its voters more intent 
on a soaring stock market than on any socially conservative agenda. 
Rep. John Porter, a moderate in his 10th term, fits this district 
like his finely tailored suits. He is among the handful of Republicans 
who have not declared their intentions yet on impeachment. Porter 
had initially spoken out against impeachment, but later said he would 
consider it after the House Judiciary Committee had concluded its 
work. A spokesman for Porter, Dave Kohn, said calls to the congressman's 
office have changed in tone a bit recently. Months ago, he said, calls 
were heavily in favor of impeachment. In recent days, however, he 
said nearly as many people were calling to urge Porter to vote against 
impeachment. Judging from the talk on the streets here, a vast majority 
of North Shore residents appear to oppose impeachment, even among 
those who voted against Clinton, like Lewis. Some people said they 
dreaded the prospect of a sensational trial in the Senate that would 
rely heavily on tawdry details. ``We'll look like jackasses to the 
rest of the world,'' Denice Mason, 65, said. ``They'll think we're 
absolutely absurd.'' A couple of her friends nodded. ``Don't these 
politicians read the polls?'' Annette Abrams, 67, asked. ``Didn't 
they pay attention to the election results?'' Charlotte Rogers, 77, 
chimed in, ``There are too many other things going on in the country.'' 
To be sure, it is not impossible to find people here who favor impeachment. 
``We have a Constitution and it must apply,'' said Peter Anton, 67, 
a project manager for a construction company. ``How can we say that 
the commander-in-chief doesn't have to abide by the same rules as 
his generals? All you get from the president is double talk.'' He 
shook his head and raised his palms skyward. ``Look, I don't really 
like the idea of all this being on television, with little kids hearing 
all these details,'' he added. ``But we can blame Clinton for that.'' 
Jennifer Merriam, a 23-year-old psychologist, does not have fond regard 
for Clinton. But she believes an impeachment trial would mean ``chaos 
for the government.'' ``Clinton is immoral and irresponsible, but 
let's let the law deal with him after he gets out of office,'' Ms. 
Merriam said. ``Think of the money all of this is costing the country.'' 
Virtually none of the voters said they believed Clinton should go 
unpunished, although Ms. Abrams said, ``So he had an affair in the 
White House. Didn't Kennedy, too, and how many others?'' Censure seemed 
to be the most popular option, even with Ms. Abrams. Others acknowledged 
that they might feel more inclined to call for more severe punishment, 
if the economy were ailing. ``The truth is, having Clinton in office 
has been pretty good for this country,'' said Lewis, the marketing 
manager. ``Times are booming for a lot of people right now. I know 
I'm enjoying my prosperity. I can buy a lot of toys. And I don't want 
the politicians doing something that's going to put that at risk.''
