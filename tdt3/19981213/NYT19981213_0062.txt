Why is BellSouth Corp. talking up its stock? That question has been 
percolating on Wall Street and in the telecommunications industry 
all fall. And while the speculation is nowhere near a boil, it is 
clear that BellSouth has become more aggressive in promoting its stock 
than it has been at any time at least since passage of the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996. There is nothing necessarily untoward about a company 
of BellSouth's caliber encouraging people to buy its shares _ or encouraging 
analysts who work for brokerage houses to raise their estimates for 
the company's performance, which is functionally the same thing. But 
in an industry where multibillion-dollar acquisitions have become 
almost commonplace, a company in BellSouth's so-far nonacquisitive 
position is bound to raise eyebrows by flogging its shares. Stock, 
after all, is the currency of most communications deals. The brows 
were set in motion in October at a meeting with investors and analysts 
at the Intercontinental Hotel in Manhattan. There, the company's top 
executives said that many analyst estimates for BellSouth's earnings 
growth were too conservative and encouraged stronger projections for 
next year. Around the same time, representatives of the company telephoned 
at least one reporter to point out how well BellSouth's stock was 
performing. There is nothing unusual about a company loudly promoting 
its prospects _ unless the company is BellSouth. After all, higher 
expectations only make it easier to fail, and BellSouth's time-honored 
reputation has been to avoid the high wire. ``BellSouth is a very 
conservative organization,'' said one Wall Street executive who follows 
the Atlanta-based company. ``Traditionally, they have not been this 
promotional.'' Late last month, in a single day, the company announced 
three moves _ each of which could be expected to nudge up its stock 
price and did so. It said it would split its shares two for one, raise 
the dividend by 5.5 percent and buy back as much as $3 billion worth 
of its stock. In an interview in early December, before another lunch 
with analysts, this one at the Waldorf-Astoria, Ronald Dykes, BellSouth's 
chief financial officer, did not disagree that his company had become 
more aggressive in discussing its stock. But he made it clear that 
the cheerleading effort had been under way for more than two months. 
``This started at our annual meeting in April,'' he said. ``But the 
guidance didn't take.'' It was in April that the company raised its 
``guidance'' for analysts on its expected per-share earnings growth 
from ``low double digits'' _ or 10 to 12 percent, in finance-speak 
_ to ``mid-teens,'' which basically means 15 percent. But not all 
the analysts followed its lead by raising their growth estimates, 
which compare 1998 data with forecasts for 1999. As Dykes told the 
analysts and investors at the Waldorf lunch, to a general chuckle, 
``It took a few folks a few quarters to figure out what `mid-teens' 
meant.'' Eventually, though, all of this ``guidance'' achieved the 
desired result. From Jan. 1 until BellSouth's annual meeting on April 
27, its stock gained 12.4 percent. That placed it second behind GTE 
Corp., at 13.5 percent, among the six local telephone giants, and 
just ahead of US West, at 11.8 percent. But for the entire year so 
far, BellSouth's shares have performed far better than the stocks 
of any of the other companies in the segment. BellSouth's stock appreciation 
of 55.5 percent through last Friday outdistanced each of the other 
five by at least 16 percentage points. But talk, even from a company 
as traditionally reticent as BellSouth, remains cheap. The strong 
performance of BellSouth's stock is grounded in one of the most respected 
telecommunications management teams in the nation. That team, led 
by F. Duane Ackerman, has done a good job of controlling costs and 
generating new revenue from existing customers, even while investing 
billions of dollars in growth markets in Latin America. For all that, 
though, why does BellSouth's stock merit a multiple of projected 1999 
earnings of 27, when the rest of the group is bunched between 20.2 
(Bell Atlantic) and 24.4 (Ameritech)? One reason could be that, unlike 
four of its brethren, BellSouth is not now betting on the successful 
execution of a multibillion-dollar merger. The conventional wisdom, 
of course, is that with the industry consolidating all around it, 
BellSouth can't continue to go it alone forever. That remains to be 
seen. But some analysts think BellSouth is getting set to use its 
elevated shares to make a bid for a new long-distance phone company. 
Those mentioned include IXC Communications and Williams Communications 
_ now that Williams Cos., the parent of Williams, has agreed to issue 
a separate stock for the long-distance business. Other analysts, though, 
say that no BellSouth purchase seems imminent. In the interview, Dykes 
would say only that within the United States, acquiring new lines 
of business seemed preferable to building them. In his presentation 
at the subsequent lunch, however, he did not shy from flashing the 
company's wallet. ``We have a lot of cash,'' he said. ``We are underleveraged. 
And we have the strongest currency in the business.''
