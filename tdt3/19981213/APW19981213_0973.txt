JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton joined Israeli children 
Sunday in ushering in the eight-day Jewish festival of Hanukkah, expressing 
hope that the first candle would kindle peace. Taking a break from 
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Clinton clapped and swayed 
as a children's choir sung the Hanukkah hymn ``Rock of My Redemption'' 
at a Hanukkah party hosted by Israeli President Ezer Weizman at his 
official residence in Jerusalem. An 11-year-old boy, Moshe Mit Babo, 
whose family immigrated to Israel from Ethiopia, wore a white skull 
cap and sang Hebrew blessings as he lit the first candle on the Menorah, 
an eight-branched candelabra. Hanukkah, also known as the festival 
of lights, commemorates the Jewish uprising in the second century 
B.C. against the Greek-Syrian kingdom, which had tried to impose its 
culture and adorn the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem with statues of Greek 
gods. Jewish legend says that when a small group of Jewish warriors 
tried to rekindle the temple's eternal flame, they found only enough 
oil for one day. But the oil lasted eight days and is believed to 
have been a miracle. Commemorating the good fortune of their ancestors, 
Jews light an additional candle at sundown each day until the candelabra 
is full. They also eat traditional foods fried in oil, such as jelly 
doughnuts and potato pancakes. Clinton compared the miracle of Hanukkah 
to the miracle of the state of Israel. He expressed the hope that 
the first candle would ``kindle a spark of peace touching all the 
peoples and places of the Holy Land.'' During his trip to the Mideast, 
Clinton is trying to repair the tattered land-for-peace agreement 
between Israel and the Palestinians. Earlier, first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton lit a Hanukkah candle, a Christmas tree and a Ramadan lantern 
as she promoted Jewish-Arab coexistence as the basis for a lasting 
peace. In synagogues, rabbis read from the Book of the Maccabees, 
which tells the story of the ancient uprising. In Israel, it has become 
a tradition during Hanukkah for orchestras and choirs to perform Handel's 
oratorio Judas Maccabaeus, which also tells the story of the rebellion. 
The victory anthem from the oratorio has become a popular children's 
song and has been set to Hebrew. Toy stores did a brisk business as 
the festival approached, with parents buying holiday gifts for children. 
Dunkin Donuts also sold thousands of jelly-filled doughnuts. Later 
Sunday, viewers around the world witnessed a simultaneous lighting 
of the Hanukkah candles on the Internet at 2015 GMT, when the ultra-Orthodox 
Habad movement opened the holiday with ceremonies in Jerusalem, Moscow, 
Paris and New York.
