It's a brisk autumn night, but The Pelican is red hot. Salsa, soca, 
calypso and reggae fill the air, energizing a diverse crowd of locals 
and visitors. ``They say we are the rainbow country,'' says a smiling 
Opal Douglass, who has come to ``lime'' _ the ubiquitous ``Trini'' 
verb meaning ``to hang out.'' She's with her friends Ron, who is of 
African descent, Terence, whose roots are in India, and others. ``I 
myself am so mixed I can only say I'm Trinidadian!'' the 33-year-old 
insurance company worker shouts above the music, then downs the rest 
of her Carib beer. Hers is a happy, booming society where things are 
looking up. ___ Leroy Clarke's dark, lined face breaks into a rueful 
grin at such talk. ``People existed here for a long time on this lie 
_ that we were some kind of `rainbow society,''' the respected Afro-Trinidadian 
poet and painter says. ``But I tell you: This rainbow has teeth. Trinidad 
as a unified society is what we can only dream of.'' With eloquent 
anger Clarke recounts how successive Spanish, French and British masters 
imported shiploads of African slaves to harvest sugar. How after the 
abolition of slavery in 1834, the British brought indentured servants 
from India. After their terms, many Indians were given land, and that, 
says Clarke, is the source of their widely perceived _ but difficult 
to quantify _ economic domination of Trinidad. Today, 40 percent of 
the 1.3 million Trinidadians are of Indian descent, and an equal share 
are of African heritage. The rest are either mixed or hail from Portugal, 
Syria and other places. Clarke, 60, sits on a wood bench surrounded 
by dozens of his mural-sized paintings in a display that occupies 
half the national museum building. His words are harsh, but measured, 
and coming from a national institution they carry some weight. ``The 
Afro-Trinidadian's disenfranchisement has never been redressed,'' 
he says. ``We are on the brink of something tragic, a tidal wave of 
psychic disorder. Any little thing could spark such a convulsion, 
such a catastrophe. So we cannot afford to go out in public and be 
ridiculous as some people have been.'' ___ He's talking about Prime 
Minister Basdeo Panday, the longtime political firebrand who was finally 
elected to head the government, by a whisker, in 1995. After 32 years 
of nearly all-black government in Trinidad, Panday's victory was a 
cathartic coming of age for the Indians, and they intend to keep what 
they have gained. For many blacks, the loss of political power on 
top of their economic woes was an almost unbearable humiliation. Panday 
can't understand what the noise is all about. In a recent speech he 
noted unemployment is down from 19 percent in 1995 to about 13 percent 
and an economy that was shrinking then will grow around 5 percent 
this year. The economy ``has never been more prosperous; it has never 
been more stable,'' he said. And the potential is tremendous. With 
natural gas reserves of more than 20 trillion cubic feet (about 600 
billion cubic meters) and probably more, Trinidad has attracted dlrs 
4 billion of investment by dozens of U.S. companies the past five 
years. Every week seems to bring a new factory opening. Yet in its 
zeal to bring him down, Panday charged, the black-dominated People's 
National Movement and the black-dominated news media have tried ``to 
whip up racist sentiments when any Afro-Trinidadian was fired or removed 
from office, even though it was for corruption or other wrongdoing.'' 
At a rally marking three years in power, Panday enraged his critics 
by openly declaring war on the press: ``They are out to destroy us. 
We must do them first ... they must not be allowed to attack this 
government unfairly and escape unscathed.'' What Panday recommended 
was an advertising boycott, but many of his supporters weren't splitting 
hairs. They began shoving, verbally abusing and throwing drinks at 
reporters and cameramen on the scene. ___ The next day, Therese Mills 
was a very worried woman. The editor of the highly successful daily 
Newsday had just ordered security beefed up in the newspaper's downtown 
building. ``There are lots of crackpots out there who could be influenced,'' 
she said. ``I'm afraid the result will be severe attacks on journalists 
and maybe even on press houses.'' ``The country has become radically 
polarized,'' she added. ``This never would have happened before Panday. 
The prime minister seems out of control.'' ___
