Asian Games officials struggled Sunday to bring the sale of soccer 
tickets under control and announced that 70 scalpers had been arrested 
in connection with a shortage that triggered violence Saturday by 
thousands of angry fans. Four more ticket booths were opened Sunday 
to help meet the demand on sales at Rajamangala National Stadium, 
where host Thailand is to play heavily favored South Korea in the 
quarterfinals Monday. Buyers were to be limited to five tickets. ``We 
must reduce the pressure outside the stadium,'' Sakchye Tupsuwan, 
chairman of the Asian Games technical committee, told a news conference 
Sunday. ``We are trying to solve this problem, but it is difficult, 
particularly with football.'' Sakchye, who urged soccer-mad Thais 
to stay home and watch Monday's match on television, said that scalpers 
at Saturday's group decider between Thailand and Qatar had driven 
up prices by three to five times their original value. Thousands of 
people had camped outside the stadium before the official opening 
of the ticket booths at 8 a.m. Saturday, Sakchye said. Noting the 
large numbers, officials opened sales early and when more people showed 
up at the normal hours, tickets were gone. Ticketless fans stormed 
the stadium fences and threw bottles, cans and shoes at riot police.
