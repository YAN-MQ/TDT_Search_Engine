If it wasn't for U.S. President Bill Clinton's huge security detail, 
the leader of a small Islamic militant group says he would kill the 
president when he comes to the Gaza Strip on Monday. Clinton is in 
the Mideast to try and salvage the accord he worked out between Israelis 
and Palestinians at Wye River in Maryland in October. ``I don't know 
of anybody in Gaza who is thinking of killing Clinton now,'' Abdallah 
Shami, the leader of the Islamic Jihad told the Spanish TV station 
Antenna 3 on Sunday. ``But if the Wye River agreement involves a change 
in the Palestinian position to the worse, and somebody does kill him, 
I will be happy,'' said Shami, relaxing in his Gaza City office decorated 
with Islamic calligraphy praising God. Asked if he would kill Clinton, 
he said: ``If I could I would, with every method I can muster. I would 
not hesitate. Clinton is coming with 1,200 security men.'' Palestinian 
militants oppose Wye because it does not finalize Palestinian claims 
to statehood and sovereignty in Jerusalem; and because it explicitly 
recognizes Israel's right to exist. The militants also accuse Arafat 
of kowtowing to Israel and the Americans during an increase in violence 
sparked by an Israeli refusal to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel 
activities. Arafat has cracked down on Islamic militants since Wye, 
and Hamas _ the more significant militant Islamic group _ has kept 
its criticism of the Clinton visit to a minimum, fearful of further 
restrictions. Clinton's visit is seen by the Palestinians and Israelis 
as endorsing Palestinian aspirations to statehood, and Arafat is anxious 
to make the U.S. leader feel welcome. Israel rejects the establishment 
of a Palestinian state, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government 
has expressed its displeasure with some aspects of the Clinton visit 
_ but Shami says he still identifies Clinton with the Israeli enemy. 
``Our people know that the bullets that are killing our sons in the 
West Bank are Israeli bullets, that the bulldozers that are building 
the settlements are Israeli, the aircraft that bombed our refugee 
camps and our homes are American planes,'' he said. Clinton ``can't 
suddenly turn into a friend and a hero. He will always remain as one 
of the biggest enemies of the Palestinian people.''
