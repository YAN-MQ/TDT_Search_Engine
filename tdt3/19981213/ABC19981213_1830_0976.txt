th The head of the international Olympic committee today promised 
to expel any member found guilty of accepting bribes. It's just the 
latest development in the growing scandal that first came to light 
three days ago. Here's ABC's Hilary brown. Three years after Salt 
Lake City won its bid to host the olympics, came an admission today 
that several members of the powerful IOC, the international Olympic 
committee, were effectively bribed for their votes. I apologize to 
the Olympic family and to the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment 
caused by the bid committee program. a $400,000 scholarship program 
was set up to benefit the relatives of six IOC members, mostly from 
Africa. Utah will not lose the Olympics. More disturbing were charges 
yesterday by a member of the IOC inner circle, marc hodler, who said 
there was a pattern of bribery in the selection of at least three 
former Olympic cities -- Atlanta, Nagano and Sydney. He cited payoffs 
of up to $5 million. The scandal has shaken the powerful committee 
in its overprivileged core. The IOC vice president, Dick pound, said 
there would be a full inquiry into all allegations. What we are concerned 
with is the possibility that there may or there may not have been 
inappropriate conduct. Today hodler said he has been muzzled by the 
IOC president. Apparently I said too much. Hodler said he hopes his 
charges will lead to a reform of the olympic selection process, in 
which the welfare of the athletes is the last consideration. Hilary 
brown, ABC News, London.
