President Clinton may be in Jerusalem for talks on Middle East peace, 
but he can't escape the growing political crisis back home. He's meeting 
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, trying to hash out differences 
over details of the wye river peace deal. But when he talked with 
reporters a short while ago, the question on many minds was this week's 
scheduled impeachment proceedings in the house. I think it's up to 
-- it's a question of whether each member will simply vote his or 
her conscience, based on the constitution and the law. And I don't 
know what's going to happen. That's up to them. It's out of my hands. 
If any member wishes to talk to me or someone on my staff, we would 
make ourselves available to them. But otherwise, I think it's important 
that they be free, to make this decision and that they not be put 
under any undue pressure from any quarter.
