Rescue workers have completed the search for victims of Friday's Thai 
airways jet crash. They recovered the remains of the last 101 victims 
yesterday. 45 people survived. The jetliner crashed into a swamp while 
trying to land in a heavy rainstorm. Police say they have recovered 
the jet's flight recorder. They hope it will help them determine why 
the plane went down.
