The shuttle "discovery" unhooked and pulled away from the international 
space station to begin the journey back to earth. They had a successful 
mission, connecting the first two modules of the station during three 
space walks. The shuttle "discovery" will do more construction work 
in the spring. "Endeavour" is expected to arrive at the Kennedy space 
center late Tuesday.
