Michelle Kwan won with the jumps and she won without them. She beat 
the pros, she beat her fellow Olympians. With confident technique 
and stunning grace, the U.S. figure skater dominated the field over 
the weekend at the World Professional Figure Skating Championships, 
capping a year in which she won everything she skated _ except, of 
course, the Nagano Olympics. ``I am very impressed by her, she is 
a true champion,'' said 1984 and 1988 Olympic champion Katarina Witt, 
who finished fifth after conceding there was no way she could beat 
Kwan. ``What she went through at the Olympics and then to come back 
and to win. It was like after (the Olympics) she was saying, `This 
is me. I deserve to win.' ``It was a beautiful moment out there to 
watch.'' Alexei Yagudin became the first Russian in the event's 26-year 
history to win the men's event, holding on to his lead even though 
three-time defending champion Kurt Browning won Saturday night's artistic 
skate. Olympic champions Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev won the 
pairs, while new partners Maya Usova and Yevgeny Platov blossomed 
through a difficult and painful year to win the dance. Kwan, meanwhile, 
even upstaged herself. Her big moment was supposed to be Friday night, 
when she used the technical program to unveil the ``Lamento d'Ariane'' 
piece that will serve as her free skate at the U.S. championships 
in February and the Olympic-level world championships in March. Kwan 
landed seven triple jumps and got one perfect 6.0 for the routine, 
which will need some polish over the next few months. Saturday, however, 
she lifted the MCI Center with a beautiful, mature skate to ``East 
of Eden,'' which included just three triples but earned five 6.0s. 
``It was one of my best performances,'' said Kwan, the youngest world 
pro champion at 18. ``When I skated, it was magical. ... I didn't 
expect much from this competition coming in. Tonight, I felt really 
on. I enjoyed myself. I felt very confident when I stepped on the 
ice.'' Japan's Yuka Sato, winner of this event in 1996, finished second, 
followed by former U.S. champion Nicole Bobek and China's Lu Chen. 
Then came the only Olympic champions in the women's field, Witt and 
Oksana Baiul. ``If the roof came down, the whole history of figure 
skating would come down with it,'' Kwan said. ``I had the chills in 
the warmup today. I looked at Oksana and saw her '94 performance at 
the Olympics and Katarina and saw her at the Olympics, and Lulu at 
worlds ... It was like a flashback. I saw all their performances right 
before my eyes.'' But Kwan was better than all of them in an event 
that was open to both pro and Olympic-level skaters for the first 
time. The opening of the competition also allowed Yagudin to finish 
a year similar to Kwan's _ no Olympic gold, but a pair of world championship 
titles on the sports' two different levels. ``This title I won is 
a nice end to this year, because it's my last championships this year,'' 
said Yagudin, also 18. Browning, with a nearly insurmountable deficit 
to make up after a lackluster performance on Friday, had the crowd 
in an uproar with a hilarious clown routine that received four perfect 
marks. But it was only a moral victory for the Canadian, who usually 
takes the competition more seriously than his fellow pros. ``These 
pro titles mean a lot to me,'' Browning said. ``When I became champion, 
it meant almost as much as the (Olympic-level) world championships. 
This is the one I hold in my heart every year.'' Todd Eldredge was 
third, followed by Rudy Galindo. Still, nothing held more intrigue 
than the dance, where Usova defeated both her ex-partner and ex-husband 
_ Alexander Zhulin _ and her ex-husband's former mistress _ Pasha 
Grischuk _ as she and Platov danced romantically to ``Moonlight Sonata.'' 
``It's a really, really difficult year for me,'' said Usova, who divorced 
Zhulin this summer. ``I change all my life. I change where I live. 
I change coach. I change partner. I change ice rinks. I change everything. 
I even change my hair. It's just like everything changes. But it's 
a good change, and right now I'm so happy.'' Grischuk and Zhulin finished 
third, behind Americans Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow.
