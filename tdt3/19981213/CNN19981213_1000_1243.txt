After becoming the all-time rushing leader in division 1-A football 
history and grabbing number other records and milestones, Texas running 
back Ricky williams was named the 64th heisman trophy winner Saturday 
night by an overwhelming margin. When the guy got up there and was 
ready to announce, my heart was beating about 200 miles a minute. 
I was like, well, you know kind of nervous and it all kind of hit 
me at that point.
