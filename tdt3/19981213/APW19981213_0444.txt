Backed by superior firepower, the rebel group UNITA has gained the 
upper hand in battles against the government's army in Angola's central 
highlands, the government's chief-of-staff said Sunday. Gen. Joao 
de Matos expressed surprise over UNITA's firepower, which he said 
included tanks, assault vehicles, and long-range artillery. ``We stand 
before a UNITA with a military potential far beyond the one it had 
before,'' Gen. Matos said in an interview broadcast Sunday on state 
radio RNA. Government officials had not made any public comment on 
the fighting since the army launched an attack on UNITA's central 
highland strongholds Dec. 4, ending a 4-year-old peace pact between 
the two sides. Gen. Matos said UNITA had launched a ``large scale'' 
counterattack near Huambo and Kuito, the strategic capitals of the 
central, highland provinces of Huambo and Bie, some 500 kilometers 
(300 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda. ``It's a critical and 
difficult situation,'' Matos said, adding that the rebels were supported 
by mercenaries from Israel, South Africa, Ukraine and Morrocco. Neither 
side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered 1994 agreement 
which ended a two-decade civil war in which 500,000 people were killed 
and hundreds of thousands more were left maimed, homeless and threatened 
by disease and hunger. The pact called on UNITA to disarm its 70,000-strong 
army and hand over control of almost half the country it occupied 
to the government. In the interview, Gen. Matos expressed dismay over 
UNITA's military buildup, which had taken place ``under the passive 
gaze of the United Nations.'' UNITA reportedly has rearmed in the 
past year and has a well-equipped guerilla army of about 30,000. The 
government army numbers 100,000, though only about 30,000 are believed 
to be properly trained soldiers. Civil war first erupted in Angola 
after the southwest African nation's 1975 independence from Portugal. 
The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement collapsed 
a year later after UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's first 
elections.
