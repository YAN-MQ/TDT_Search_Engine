Don't expect any more updates on the health of baseball great Joe 
DiMaggio. This morning, the 84-year-old ordered his doctor to stop 
talking with the media about his condition. In keeping with the slugger's 
wishes, Dr. Earl Barron today refused to say whether DiMaggio's condition 
had been upgraded from critical status. Several days ago, DiMaggio 
was in a coma and apparently on the verge of dying, but his health 
improved dramatically yesterday. He's still hospitalized in Hollywood, 
Florida.
