Fernando Vargas is looking forward to fighting again. So is Arturo 
Gatti. ``This is a young man's sport,'' Vargas said after winning 
the IBF junior middleweight title by stopping veteran Yory Boy Campas 
after seven rounds Saturday night at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic 
City. The 21-year-old Vargas became a champion in only his 15th pro 
fight, beating an opponent who was fighting for the 75th time. ``Beginning 
in 1999, everybody's taking a back seat to Fernando Vargas because 
he's going to be a superstar in boxing,'' promoter Dina Duva said 
early Sunday. Vargas, of Oxnard, California, showed fair power and 
a lot of poise in remaining unbeaten and becoming the second 1996 
U.S. Olympic Boxer to win a world title. The first was Floyd Mayweather, 
World Boxing Council super featherweight champion. Gatti did not attend 
the news conference because he went to a hospital for the stitching 
of cuts above and below the left eye. He lost a unanimous decision 
to Ivan Robinson in a 10-round brawl that was the second half of a 
cable television doubleheader. ``I will fight again,'' said Gatti, 
a former International Boxing Federation junior lightweight champion 
from Jersey City, New Jersey, who now has taken batterings in losing 
three straight fights. ``They should never fight anyone but each other,'' 
said Lou DiBella of HBO. The 27-year-old Robinson (26-2), of Philadelphia, 
certainly doesn't need another fight against Gatti, who he now has 
beaten twice while taking a good deal of punishment. Another win over 
Gatti would do him no good. Gatti is only 26 and has a 29-4 record, 
but his brawling style in which defense seems almost an afterthought 
has cost him in many of his wins, as well as losses. But he makes 
exciting fights, and that makes him popular with fans and with television. 
According to CompuBox punch counts, Gatti landed 274 punches when 
he lost a split decision to Robinson Aug. 22 and he connected with 
342 blows Saturday night. Robinson, however, connected with 400 punches 
in the first fight and with 440 Saturday night. Campas, bleeding from 
the nose and from cuts over the right eye and on the upper lip, also 
did not attend the news conference The Mexican is only 27, not an 
old man, but 75 fights, of which he has won 72, appear to have made 
him an old fighter. At the end of the seventh round, Campas, who has 
scored 62 knockouts, turned to his corner and said he had enough. 
Youth had been served.
