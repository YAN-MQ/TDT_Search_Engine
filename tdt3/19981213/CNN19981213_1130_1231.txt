Ten early games on the NFL slate today. We start in the NFC. Chris 
Chandler and the falcons look to stay in the Hunt for postseason home-field 
advantage. Atlanta, 11-2, in New Orleans. Green bay tries again to 
nail down a playoff spot, facing the bears at lambeau. The Cardinals 
try to keep postseason hopes alive. Arizona's in Philly, while Washington 
plays in Carolina. You know the deal with Denver, you've heard all 
about it, 13-0, at the meadowlands facing the giants, while the bengals 
are at Indianapolis. The jags try to Clinch the AFC central without 
injured qb Mark Brunell. Jamie Martin gets the start versus Tennessee. 
Both the steelers and Bucs need wins to boost postseason hopes. While 
drew Bledsoe, pins in his broken finger, looks to guide New England 
to its fourth consecutive win. The pats face the lowly Rams. And 39-year-old 
Wade Wilson will be under center for Oakland when it faces the bills. 
Buffalo looks to stay just one game behind the winner of the day's 
marquee matchup. The jets and dolphins, tied atop in the AFC east, 
face off in Miami. Tonight, New York's potent "O" goes up against 
the stingiest "D" in the league. The first of three tough games. Our 
problem is we've got three division games right in a row, two of them 
are on the road you know, against contenders. Now, that's not easy 
to do at any time. You know, and everybody's involved in this, so 
like I said if we can get through this and win, we will have earned 
this without question. Also, without question, Ricky Williams is this 
year's heisman trophy winner. The Texas running back and all-time 
leading rusher in division I-A history was a landslide winner over 
Kansas state qb Michael Bishop.
