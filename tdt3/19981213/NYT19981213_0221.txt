All season, the black beret for sale in the hat department at the 
trendy Fred Segal shop in Santa Monica, Calif., had been more a conversation 
piece than a must-have purchase, and a number of shoppers stopped 
to make some crack or other about what they all recognized as ``the 
Monica Lewinsky beret.'' Then last week, with the Judiciary Committee 
debating the consequences of the president's cover-up of his dalliance 
with Ms. Lewinsky, who should walk in but the world's most famous 
former intern, wearing low-key leggings and huge, movie-star sunglasses? 
When Ms. Lewinsky purchased the beret, put it on and wore it out of 
the store, the sales staff nearly had to be resuscitated _ all the 
more so because her credit card took five minutes to clear and they 
had to refrain from laughing. ``She was trying to look totally incognito 
wearing these big glasses,'' said a Los Angeles shop owner, ``and 
then she puts on the hat.''
