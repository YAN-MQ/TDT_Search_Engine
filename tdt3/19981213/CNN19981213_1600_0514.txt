This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for Monday. Clouds and rain will continue to move slowly 
off the southeast coast and across Florida, as a cold front pushes 
into the plains states producing some snow and windy conditions through 
the rocky mountains. We'll see a brief break across the northwestern 
part of the country. But there's another frontal system that's moving 
into that area. Highs on Monday, 20s and 30s over the intermountain 
west and northeast. 40s and 50s over the upper midwest. We'll see 
60s and 70s in the south. Looking ahead to Tuesday, a little bit showery 
across the edges, but everything else looks good with the cooler air 
across the north central part of the country. On Wednesday, snow showers 
in the Great Lakes. 20s and 30s there. Thursday, rain or snow across 
the northeast. 20s and 30s will be the highs in that region, with 
milder weather, 40s and 50s across the northwest. Don't forget, you 
can find four-day forecast for more than 7,200 cities on cNN interactive.
