Well, the New York Mets have finally found a leadoff hitter. And he 
could be the best ever. Rickey Henderson, the all-time leader in steals, 
turns 40 on Christmas day, signed a one-year guaranteed contract with 
New York. Last season, he led the majors in steals with 66. That's 
more than the entire Mets' team. Our lead-off hitter stole 15 bases 
in 1998. Our team stole 62 bases in '98, rickey Henderson stole 66 
by himself. So, we've actually doubled our production by bringing 
rickey on board.
