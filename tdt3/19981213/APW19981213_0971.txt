The Royal Dutch-Shell Group is expected to unveil a sweeping cost-cutting 
program reducing the value of its assets by billions of dollars when 
it meets with analysts Monday. Other possible actions by the Anglo-Dutch 
oil giant include a profit warning and an announcement of plans to 
sell parts of the business. The company would not comment on the meeting 
but said it planned to issue a statement Monday afternoon. Like other 
oil groups, Shell has been hit by a double blow of 12-year lows in 
the price of oil and falling demand in crisis-hit Asia. The group 
said Thursday that it has restructured its management ranks, giving 
more responsibility to the heads of the company's five business divisions 
in an effort to ensure it suffers less in the troubled oil market. 
Analysts predict Shell will write down up to nearly dlrs 5 billion 
from previous valuations of the company's assets. ``Shell has been 
somewhat behind its rivals in cutting costs. It has a famously bureaucratic 
management structure,'' said Jim Wood-Smith, head of research at stockbrokers 
Greig Middleton. ``This means there is plenty of room for efficiencies 
and job cuts are inevitable.'' The group has already announced the 
likely closure of its 92,000-barrels-a-day Shell Haven refinery in 
Britain. One analyst said Shell would be looking to sell parts of 
its chemical and coal divisions, while there may also be further European 
refinery cuts to come. Industry experts have said 15 percent of the 
production capacity in Europe's refineries needs to be cut to bring 
stability to the market. Some Shell watchers warned the announcement 
may not include much detail. They said the company may choose to tell 
staff of its plans before it tells analysts. The Sunday Times reported 
that analysts predict the company may be planning to dispose of about 
dlrs 6.6 billion in assets in the next three years and that it will 
announce a reduction in capital spending for next year from almost 
dlrs 16.5 billion to dlrs 11.6 billion.
