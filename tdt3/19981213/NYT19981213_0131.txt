Just as Rep. Bill Redmond faces one of the most crucial votes of his 
brief career in Congress, the New Mexico Republican has seen the number 
of telephone lines in his office plummet from one dozen to one. Facing 
a debate on Thursday on the impeachment of President Clinton, Redmond 
is deprived of the standard gauge of public opinion _ the tally of 
constituent telephone calls. After losing last month's election to 
Tom Udall, a Democrat, Redmond closed his offices in Santa Fe and 
in Washington. And he was downgraded last week to a cubicle in a basement 
room for lame-duck congressmen. There, he said he works with a desk, 
a computer ``without a printer'' and one telephone with an answering 
machine. But impeachment should not be decided by opinion polls, cautioned 
Redmond, one of several dozen representatives who have not announced 
how they will vote on impeachment. ``If anything characterizes my 
approach to the decision I will make Thursday, it is that I am very 
dispassionate about it, I am hyperrational,'' Redmond, a 44-year-old 
political conservative, said Saturday over a bottle of a root beer 
in a doughnut shop here. ``You don't draw all your hypothesis until 
you have all the data, and we don't have all the data.'' Redmond said 
he planned to study the impeachment process intently before Thursday's 
vote. That process, he said, is little understood, even by America's 
most educated citizens. Noting the high concentration here of scientists 
involved in nuclear weapons research, the congressman said, ``You 
have more Ph.D.s per capita in Los Alamos than anywhere else in the 
nation, but I don't think that one out of 100 understand impeachment.'' 
On Friday, a few hours before the first committee votes, Redmond helped 
open a new homeless center in Santa Fe, a liberal city that voted 
against him last month by a 3-to-1 margin. ``Each person who spoke 
with me told me personally, to my face, said that I should vote for 
impeachment,'' he recalled Saturday. ``I've got Democrats coming up 
to me, with red faces, saying `What am I going to tell my kids?''' 
Redmond, who has a master's degree in philosophy of science, has consistently 
voted with the Republican majority during his one term in Congress. 
A former minister at the Santa Fe Christian Church, Redmond was dismissive 
of the president's most recent plea for forgiveness, made Friday afternoon. 
``If there is no clear direct object, how could there be forgiveness?'' 
he asked, recalling the practice in his church of asking forgiveness 
for specific transgressions. ``He wants forgiveness, but for what?'' 
As Christmas carols played in the doughnut shop's jukebox and aluminum-foil 
snowflakes twinkled from the ceiling, the congressman cited an Old 
Testament parable to say that ``forgiveness does not mean not having 
to live the consequences.'' Switching to the modern language of therapy, 
from his days as a marriage and drug counselor, he said, ``The president 
is calling on the nation to share his victimization.'' In conclusion, 
he said the president would be better off with ``tough love.'' At 
the shop counter, opinions were divided. Judith Duncan, a bed-and-breakfast 
owner from Taos, a Democratic bastion, was ordering a cup of hot cocoa, 
with whipped cream on top. ``I'm embarrassed, disgusted, outraged 
_ but I'm not saying I want everything disrupted,'' Ms. Duncan said, 
referring to the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Referring 
to the recent impeachment flare-up, she said: ``It's running away 
with us. The people don't have a say.'' But Veta Floyd, the owner 
of the shop, Daylight Doughnuts, voiced an opinion more in line with 
Los Alamos, a conservative community that voted heavily for Redmond 
last month. ``Justice needs to be done,'' she said, preparing an espresso 
almost exactly at the time the Judiciary Committee in Washington was 
voting the fourth article of impeachment. ``It doesn't matter what 
the public thinks. We have rules to follow. We have a Constitution.''
