Waving old copies of the banned liberal newspaper Tous, Iranian youths 
at a pro-democracy rally shouted as if they were fans at a soccer 
match: ``Give us back the freedom paper.'' ``Freedom, forever,'' they 
yelled, their voices getting louder and angrier. ``Yazdi, resign, 
resign,'' they chanted, referring to Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, who 
as the head of the powerful judiciary is behind the closure of about 
half a dozen newspapers and the arrests of several journalists. The 
reason behind the anger is that Iran's newspapers are at the center 
of the battle over the country's future between President Mohammad 
Khatami and the hard-line clerics who oppose his efforts to liberalize 
government and society. The newspapers do not just cover the news, 
they are the news. Since Iran has no formal political parties, most 
of Tehran's 37 papers have become stand-in parties _ each with its 
own platform _ in what has become the liveliest democratic debate 
the country has ever seen. The moderates claim about a dozen newspapers 
_ the most popular being Salam, Hamshahri, Zan, Jahan-e Eslam, Asr-e 
Ma and Arya. The hard-line papers include Kayhan, Resalat, Jomhuri 
Eslami, Shalamcheh and Abrar. Shalamcheh reflects the extremist views 
of the Ansar-e Hezbollah, a vigilante group that regularly breaks 
up pro-democracy rallies and attacks dissidents. The outspoken Tous, 
closed down in September, has become a symbol in the struggle for 
a free press. Its editor, Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, says the liberal 
papers started after Khatami's election are being attacked by hard-liners 
to undermine the president. ``They were unable to fight him directly, 
so they attacked his achievements to weaken him,'' said Shamsolvaezin. 
``I believe that Mr. Khatami's program of free expression has suffered 
a serious stroke and it is now in intensive care,'' said Shamsolvaezin, 
whose paper had a circulation of 300,000, the second largest in Iran. 
Shamsolvaezin, who was jailed along with three other senior colleagues, 
said 30 vigilantes stormed his newspaper in September ``by jumping 
over the wall,'' blindfolding them and making them stand against the 
wall. ``It was very uncivilized,'' he said at his Tehran home shortly 
after his release. Tous' struggle to survive is typical of how the 
battle between moderates and hard-liners over Iran's future is being 
fought. The paper began publishing with the name Jameah after Khatami 
became president in August 1997. A court order, alleging libel and 
fabrication of stories, closed it down last June. It then reappeared 
under two other names _ Tous and Aftab-e Emrouz _ after being given 
new licenses to publish by the Ministry of Culture and Guidance, which 
is under Khatami's control. Each time it was shut down by the judiciary, 
which is run by the hard-liners. The paper was first closed after 
it reported that the commander of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, 
Gen. Rahim Safavi, told his troops in private meeting to ``cut out 
the throats and tongues'' of the liberal press. But Tous had a stormy 
relationship with the hard-liners from the start, partly because it 
questioned the absolute powers of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah 
Ali Khamenei. The paper was closed for good June 16, a day after Khamenei 
ordered the judiciary to get tough with newspapers that he claimed 
had abused press freedom. Several other publications, including the 
lively Rah-e Now, also were closed. Shamsolvaezin won't apologize 
for questioning the leader's absolute powers and demands to know the 
legal reason his paper was shut down. ``The constitution stipulates 
that the leader is like any other citizen before the law,'' he said. 
``What did we do wrong? What did we violate? Give us a constitutional 
reason why and where we acted against the law.'' But even some moderates 
say Tous went too far in attacking the right-wing clerics. ``Tous 
marched ahead with a sharp object and plunged it right into their 
stomach,'' said Abbas Abdi, editor of the liberal daily Salam. Some 
journalists also say Tous miffed Khamenei because it ignored an unspoken 
rule of Iranian newspapers _ dedicating the top of the front page 
and a few inside columns to news about the leader and senior clergymen. 
But Ali Movahedi Savoji, a hard-line member of Parliament, says the 
judiciary acted totally under the law in banning Tous. ``Over the 
past year, we gave them 114 warnings that they were violating the 
law. The press is free, but at the same time laws have to be obeyed,'' 
said Savoji. Shamsolvaezin has a different view about so-called freedom 
in Iran following his jailing. ``We have freedom of expression in 
Iran,'' he said. ``But the problem is freedom after expression.''
