His back against the wall, President Clinton says he has no intention 
of resigning. He made those comments while on a state visit to the 
Middle East. Last week, the house Judiciary committee approved four 
articles of impeachment against him, mainly along party lines. Although 
the White House has decried the process as unfair, Mr. Clinton says 
he will let things run their course, instead of lobbying for support. 
I think it's up to -- it's a question of whether each member will 
simply vote his or her conscience based on the constitution and the 
law, and I don't know what's going to happen, that's up to them. It's 
out of my hands. If any member wishes to talk to me or someone on 
my staff, we would make ourselves available to them. But otherwise 
I think it's important that they be free to make this decision, and 
that they not be put under any undo pressure from any quarter.
