Visiting U.N. inspectors began the last day of this round of inspections 
Sunday in the ongoing search for Iraq's illegal weapons. Caroline 
Cross, spokeswoman for the United Nations Special Commission, said 
most of the visiting 40 inspectors, who must be out of Iraq by Tuesday, 
left the country on Sunday and the rest will leave Monday. Up to 140 
resident monitors will, however, remain in Iraq to continue their 
work. ``All the remaining inspectors have gone to carry on their work 
in a normal way on Sunday,'' she said. ``We hope that the report on 
Iraq's cooperation with the Commission will be introduced before the 
end of this week,'' Cross told The Associated Press. She refused to 
say where or what type of inspections were to take place Sunday. Visiting 
inspectors pay surprise visits to weapons sites. The U.N. inspectors 
must certify that Iraq has dismantled its chemical, biological and 
nuclear programs and long-range missiles before U.N. sanctions can 
be lifted. The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait in 1990. This week's searches, which are expected to 
end Monday, have been the most intensive since Iraq allowed UNSCOM 
to resume work last month after putting a halt in August. Iraq backed 
down only hours before the United States had planned to launch military 
strikes on Nov. 14. President Saddam Hussein's government also pledged 
full cooperation to the inspectors, and the latest searches are seen 
as a test of that. Meanwhile, Iraqi papers on Sunday accused chief 
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler of prolonging the inspections 
and the sanctions. Butler's ``aggressive policy toward Iraq'' is aimed 
at undermining Iraq's independence, said al-Thawra daily, a government 
newspaper. ``The continuation of the Commission's work means the continuation 
of sanctions and plotting against Iraq,'' said the pro-government 
al-Qadissiya daily in an editorial.
