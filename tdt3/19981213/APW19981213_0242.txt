Dismissed copper miners have threatened to riot and occupy a Cobar 
mine if Swiss company Glencore fails to sign off on a deal to buy 
the mine on Tuesday. Glencore and the Mount Lyell Mining Co. agreed 
in principle in September to buy the western New South Wales mine, 
which had closed in February resulting in the loss of 270 jobs. Mount 
Lyell and Glencore agreed to buy the mine after the government offered 
relief from taxes and deferred royalty payments. Also, last week, 
it was announced that the miners were set to receive a cash payout 
of more than 5 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.1 million) 
by Dec. 25, ending a 10-month battle for entitlements owed by the 
former mine owner, Ashanti Goldfields Co, of Ghana. A creditors' meeting 
scheduled for Tuesday was expected to seal the deal. Shearers' and 
Rural Workers' Union general secretary Stephen Roach said Glencore 
was refusing to sign the agreement until it negotiated a better deal 
on the supply of water with Cobar Shire Council. ``We thought the 
deal was all stitched up but now Glencore is not going to sign off 
until this water deal is cleared up _ three months ago that didn't 
matter,'' Roach said. ``They picked up the mine for next to nothing, 
they've been promised 4 million dollars in concessions by the New 
South Wales government _ now they want more,'' he said. If Glencore 
did not sign off on the deal at the creditors' meeting on Tuesday, 
Roach said the retrenched miners would ``occupy and run the mine ourselves.'' 
``Or we're going to have a riot,'' Roach said. ``Someone even talked 
about driving a ute (pickup truck) down the mine shaft and stuffing 
up the whole operation.'' Many of the former miners would be in ``big, 
big'' financial trouble if they weren't paid before Dec. 25, Roach 
said. ``Many of these people are in so much debt that the money they'll 
get will only clear their debts,'' he said.
