educational. Ann Kellan reports. Move over furby, make way for toys 
that make kids think. Toys that teach everything from life sciences 
to geography, math and engineering. This is my second time I ever

pick ones that pique their interests. That way, learning becomes a 
game, a toy, that's hard to put away. Ann Kellan, CNN, Atlanta.
