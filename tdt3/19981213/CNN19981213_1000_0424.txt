Voters in Puerto Rico go to the polls today. They'll decide whether 
they want the island to become the 51st state. If the majority cast 
"yes" ballots, a long process could begin to convert the island from 
commonwealth status to statehood. Today's election is nonbinding, 
and Congress ultimately has the final say in the island's future.
