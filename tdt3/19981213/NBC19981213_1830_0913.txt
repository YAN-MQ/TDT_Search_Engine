when "nbc nightly news" continues -- the street preachers of pasadena. 
we take our sight for granted in america. but for many people, it's 
a luxury. every year, lenscrafters runs "gift of sight" missions, 
to bring sight to needy people around the world. we change lives with 
these glasses. you drop them off at lenscrafters, and we'll get them 
to people who need them. and just the look on their face, like, "wow!" 
every single pair matters, and the more we collect, the more people 
we can help. the truck is here. introducing the new silverado... it's 
bigger. it's more powerful. it's the truck from chevrolet. like a 
rock oh, like a rock.
