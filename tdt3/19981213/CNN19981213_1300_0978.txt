Paying for college can be a daunting task. But there is plenty of 
help available if you don't let the paperwork get in your way. Lauren 
Thierry has the story. 50% of college students receive some form of 
financial assistance. On January 1st, the education department begins 
accepting 1999 financial aid applications. The government calculates 
expected family contributions to college costs, then colleges use 
the results to determine aid packages. Everybody should apply for 
financial aid. Because sometimes you can be pleasantly surprised as 
to the amount that you might get. And basically, everybody will also 
qualify for loans under the federal family education loan program. 
There are four kinds of federal aid -- need-based grants, which don't 
need to be repaid. Government loans, worth roughly $35 billion next 
year. While everyone qualifies, some loans have more favorable repayment 
terms. Work study offers paid student jobs subsidized by the government. 
And finally, there are both federal and state tax benefits which can 
offer thousands of dollars in breaks. A family of four earning $40,000 
can expect $600 in Pell grants and government loans of $2,600 for 
a first-year student. Scholarship and work study packages vary by 
school, so shop around. Finally, for those repaying existing student 
loans, the department of education is refinancing them at beneficial 
rates until January 31st. That's "your money." Lauren Thierry, "CNN 
Financial News," New York.
