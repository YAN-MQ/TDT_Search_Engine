A heavy silence pervades the dead zone at the center of Kosovo's suspended 
war, where only packs of wild dogs and fear thrive. Suddenly a lone 
figure in a black beret appears in the rubble of the decimated ghost 
town, tracked intently by a gunman in blue on a distant rooftop. The 
ethnic Albanian refugee feels the Serb sniper's gaze but averts his 
eyes as he trudges through a nightmarish landscape of charred, smashed 
buildings. ``Even if they kill me, I had to see my hometown again,'' 
72-year-old Adem Mazreku says, gesturing to the police base where 
a tank barrel aims menacingly at the town. ``But as long as they are 
here, we won't come back.'' Malisevo, located in the Drenica region 
that is the heartland of separatist rebels, has become a focal point 
of unsuccessful diplomacy to settle the conflict in the Serbian province. 
The U.N. refugee agency says it is a ``symbol of fear'' among tens 
of thousands of displaced people _ a stark reminder that all is not 
well in Kosovo despite the absence of combat. Despite a two-month-old 
truce, a Serb-Albanian standoff over the eerie town remains unresolved. 
Many fear it will provide the spark to ignite new fighting across 
Kosovo by spring. Diplomats and humanitarian officials have pressed 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw police from their 
Malisevo fortress, in order to facilitate the Kosovo Albanians' return 
to their homes. But he has refused. The daily patrols of Serb armored 
vehicles and truckloads of gun-toting Malisevo policemen through area 
villages send children scurrying and have raised fears of a new showdown. 
The potential for explosive incidents is so high that international 
monitors have begun accompanying the police on their rounds, producing 
the unlikely sight of U.S. armored cars leading Serb convoys. Malisevo, 
40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of the capital Pristina, was the 
main stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army when Serbian police 
overran it in July, sending its 3,000 residents fleeing ahead of a 
scorched-earth offensive. The Serbs maintain the police contingent 
is necessary to prevent the KLA from reclaiming the key town. They 
reject the rebels' demand that they withdraw from Malisevo _ and international 
diplomats acknowledge that their presence there does not violate the 
October agreement on pullouts as the guerrillas claim. ``Police will 
remain stationed in Malisevo regardless of the KLA's request,'' said 
a senior police official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Nowhere 
in the world should police withdraw on terrorists' demand.'' Barely 
three kilometers (two miles) away, KLA fighters walk around openly 
in the adjacent village of Dragobilje. Several guard the entrance 
to a low-slung compound where rows of black combat boots line the 
doorway _ a rebel command post. ``These activities must stop,'' says 
Daja Cet, a stern-faced local KLA commander. ``Only Albanians live 
in this area. Their patrols are a provocation.'' The Americans' decision 
to escort Serb convoys, after two Serb policemen were killed while 
delivering supplies to Malisevo, raised eyebrows among some European 
diplomats. But a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, which is taking over monitoring duties in the area, says 
the idea is to avoid further abuses by the Serbs, not assist them. 
``They're there to verify that the police patrol behaves in a manner 
that's in line with the cease-fire agreement, and not harassment of 
the local population,'' Duncan Bullivant said. A team of British verifiers 
hopes to further discourage violence by moving into a house in abandoned 
Malisevo. In the meantime, few dare linger in the town. Neighboring 
villages, packed with Malisevo's displaced, were buzzing with alarm 
in recent days after reports that a Serb sniper fired from the police 
station at two people who were trying to move out of their damaged 
homes. Still, a small handful of people make their way cautiously 
every day through the wreckage of broken glass, chunks of bricks, 
and splintered wood to visit their former homes. For many, it is a 
matter not of curiosity but desperation. Sevdije Mazreku, 22, a neighbor 
of Adem but no relation, passes him on her way into town and inquires 
about the danger. Eight months' pregnant with her fourth child, she 
has made the long walk from another village in order to fetch belongings 
left behind in panic last summer. ``I'm very afraid, but I had to 
come back,'' she says. ``I have no other way to get clothes for my 
children.'' Timidly escorting visitors to her still-intact house, 
which she visited earlier this fall, she surveys the damage sadly. 
Family photos of smiling children from another time remain on the 
wall, but clothes are heaped in a pile, mattresses are rotting, and 
furniture, TV, VCR and jewelry are missing. She and six other people, 
including her children, now subsist in the damp basement of a house 
_ miserable conditions, but safer than Malisevo. At mention of her 
coming baby, she puts a hand on her belly and smiles plaintively. 
``Who can be happy giving birth to a baby in the middle of a war,'' 
she says, ``without even basic necessities?''
