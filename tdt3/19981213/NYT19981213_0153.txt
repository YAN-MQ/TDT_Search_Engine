The golf course at Soweto's Country Club has come a long way since 
the days when players putted on greens that were just smoothed-over 
dirt and the holes were buried tin cans. The course _ like Soweto 
itself _ is coming up in the world. It has a new wrought-iron fence, 
three specialized mowing machines, a sprinkler system and a campaign 
to remake its image, which has managed to attract dozens of white 
players, at least for the day. Next year the club plans to more than 
triple its annual fees _ though at less than $100 it will surely remain 
the best deal around. And there are blueprints for much more _ a pool, 
a tennis court, a bowling green. There are lots of changes these days 
in South Africa's most famous black township. The dusty streets that 
used to snake all over Soweto _ home to perhaps 4 million people, 
most of them living in shacks or government-issue matchbox houses 
_ are almost a thing of the past. Hundreds of miles of roads have 
been paved since the African National Congress came to power in 1994. 
Some 2,000 street lights have been installed. Garbage is collected. 
Water is far more reliable. And everywhere there are signs of the 
kind of ambition driving the remake of the Country Club. Under the 
former government, commerce was strictly controlled to force Sowetans 
to buy from white-owned stores in downtown Johannesburg. These days, 
however, Soweto has several new shopping areas of its own and a mall. 
There are dozens of new restaurants _ including a pizza parlor, an 
art gallery, two bed-and-breakfasts and a cafe where you can eat brunch 
and drink cappuccino under pink umbrellas. Soweto has always been 
an afterthought of urban geography _ a centerless bedroom community 
for black South Africans set up just close enough to downtown so they 
could get to work, but just far enough away so that tanks could close 
off the roads if unrest broke out. Even the golf course, some say, 
was built to create a buffer zone between black and mixed-race areas. 
But many here hope that the township, which nurtured great anti-apartheid 
leaders like Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu and was the setting for 
some of the liberation movement's most brutal confrontations, will 
someday be a vibrant city of its own. ``Eventually, we are going to 
get there,'' said Stella Dubazana, who opened Soweto's first pizza 
parlor two years ago, Palazzo di Stella, in a former police station. 
``We have a lot of hope.'' More than 1,000 tourists visit each day, 
but most spend only a few hours on guided tours and return to the 
lush hotels of the northern suburbs to eat and to shop. Mrs. Dubazana 
and others would like them to stay a little longer. More than a dozen 
Soweto business people have gotten together to offer a tour of Soweto's 
``shebeens,'' the illegal taverns that blacks used to run in the townships. 
The tour includes stops like the pizzeria and the art gallery as well. 
Michael Nompula, the golf club's president, would like to see the 
tourists play golf too. ``Why not?'' he says. ``They could meet people 
here and really talk to Sowetans.'' There are a few problems however. 
The greens don't stay green all year _ wrong kind of grass. The sand 
traps don't have any sand _ too expensive. And the players must remove 
branches from the holes before they putt. The club has flags, but 
they come out only on special occasions. The club lost 72 flags last 
year. Soweto's poorer residents steal them for curtain rods. But Nompula's 
dreams see past all this. ``Maybe in another five years,'' he says. 
``People will look at this golf course and they'll say, `What a beautiful 
club _ we didn't know what you were talking about.''' To be sure, 
crime and unemployment remain major issues in Soweto. The township 
has the highest rate of car hijacking in the country. Just last month, 
Mandela apologized to the visiting head of the West Indies Cricket 
Board after he, his wife and two escorts were robbed while visiting 
Soweto's only cricket oval. Gunmen forced them to lie down in the 
parking lot and stole their cash, jewelry and car. And many who can 
now afford it are leaving Soweto for the white suburbs, often because 
they want better schools for their children. The golf club once had 
800 members. But these days blacks can play on any course if they 
have the money, so membership has dwindled to 200. The club has attracted 
some white members of late. But in many cases they have no intention 
of playing here _ they only want to get an official handicap cheaply. 
So they pay their dues and play as guests at fancier clubs. ``It would 
be nice to see some of them become active members instead of just 
using it as a bridge to the milk and honey,'' said Martin Pinto, who 
just finished a term as the president of the South African Golf Association. 
Nompula says that even some black players do the same _ running to 
him at the last minute to get their handicaps because they want to 
enter a tournament at some other club. But in recent years, the club 
has been able to make some improvements, in part with government funding. 
But Nompula says the club cannot ask the government for more when 
so many people lack housing, schools and water. He wants private investors. 
He doesn't like to harp on the past. Bygones should be bygones, he 
said, although he added, ``It did have a certain effect on us and 
we could use some help.'' On a recent weekend, there were foursomes 
all over the course, though no white players were to be seen. In the 
afternoon, the men gathered on the pink leatherette sofas to watch 
soccer. Some of the players have recently found good jobs and can 
only now afford a game like golf. Others have been playing for years 
and remember the early days when they could not play in the white 
clubs. Nowadays, they have all at least tried the plush ``white'' 
courses. ``There,'' said J.J. Motha, who at 77 has been playing for 
40 years, ``when you play badly, you have only yourself to blame.'' 
In three years, Nompula says, if all goes well, the South African 
Open could be played here. ``This is a lovely place, relaxed,'' he 
said. ``No hooligans here. We just need a little help.''
