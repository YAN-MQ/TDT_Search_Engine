Watching workers struggle to raise a giant American flag on Sunday 
in Gaza City's main square, college student Ahmed Masoudi was unimpressed. 
``All these U.S. flags everywhere _ what's it for? For Clinton to 
see for one day?'' the 18-year-old said on the eve of the American 
president's arrival. ``We should think about the day after.'' The 
Gaza Strip, a self-ruled sliver of Mediterranean coast wedged between 
Israel and Egypt, is famous among Palestinians for its fortunetellers 
and clairvoyants, but few of those living here can agree on a vision 
of its future. The present is confounding enough. President Bill Clinton 
and Hillary Rodham Clinton will spend only a few hours on the ground 
in Gaza Monday, but even such a brief stay is sufficient to get a 
sense of its jarring contradictions. The region _ a complex patchwork 
of Palestinian refugee camps, Jewish settlements and Israeli military 
bases _ has been under Palestinian rule for the past four years. But 
most Palestinians living here still feel suffocated by Israeli restrictions. 
Israel controls the external borders, patrols the coastal waters, 
grants or denies permits to travel to the West Bank, regulates the 
water supply. Gaza is powerless even in the most literal sense: it 
must buy its electricity from Israel. Yet the sense of coming statehood 
may be strongest here. Palestinians rejoiced last month over the opening 
of their international airport in Gaza, their first gateway to the 
world, and have made it clear that they consider Clinton's landing 
at it akin to a presidential seal of approval for their larger aspirations. 
When Israel handed most of Gaza over to the Palestinians in the wake 
of the Oslo peace accords, most Israelis were happy to let it go. 
The land to which Israel laid biblical claim was in the West Bank, 
not here. The late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was once quoted as 
saying he wouldn't care if Gaza fell into the sea. Gazans complain 
that Israel's nearly 30-year military occupation _ which began when 
Israel seized the strip in the 1967 Mideast war _ left them with an 
infrastructure either wrecked or never built to begin with. When the 
six-year intefadeh, or uprising against Israeli rule, trailed off 
in 1993, Gaza City _ a metropolis of nearly half a million people 
_ did not even have a single traffic light. Now Gaza City presents 
a boomtown landscape, bristling with satellite dishes and new high-rises 
_ though many buildings stand unfinished because developers ran out 
of money midway, or absconded with it. An infusion of foreign aid 
helped pave main roads and even create a few belts of greenery, but 
the spruced-up appearance belies huge tracts of abject poverty, including 
the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, which the first lady will visit. 
The strip's eight refugee camps, created when Palestinians fled or 
were driven from their homes with the creation of Israel in 1948, 
are home to nearly 400,000 people. The camps contain some of the world's 
most densely populated areas, with among the highest fertility rates. 
Barefoot children play in unpaved streets plied by donkey-drawn carts. 
Many people live in concrete-block shacks with corrugated tin roofs 
topped with rocks to keep them from blowing away. Beautifying Gaza 
might seem like a contradiction in terms, but in the days before the 
Clinton visit, workers were doing their best to dispel the general 
impression of dinginess. In some areas where his motorcade was to 
pass, workers planted flowers and applied fresh coats of paint. ``We 
should make Gaza look better, especially now that we have this historic 
visit,'' said municipal spokesman Hamdi Abu Karsh. Gaza's public mores 
are generally more conservative than in the West Bank _ there are 
no movie theaters, alcohol is banned, and nightspots are almost nonexistent. 
Perhaps because of that, the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal gives genuine 
offense to many here. Fundamentalist groups like Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad were doing all they could to capitalize on that distaste in 
advance of the visit. ``This trip is to serve Clinton first _ he has 
domestic problems, and we should not pay the price for his immoral 
behavior,'' said Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar. ``In Islam, a man 
who has conducted such behavior deserves flogging, not an honorable 
reception.''
