The full house is expected to vote on the articles sometime this week, 
and republican leaders say a democratic plan to offer an alternative 
of censure will fail. Carl Rochelle has more on that and the rest 
of last week's debate. wye. Mr. Bryant? aye. The house Judiciary committee, 
slowed by partisan bickering, approved the last of four articles of 
impeachment against president clinton. The final article charged the 
president abused the powers of his office. This article stands as 
an assault on the Congress, because of the false and misleading answers 
he gave to Congress under oath. Chairman Hyde pointed specifically 
to 10 of the 81 questions the committee submitted to President Clinton, 
such as question number 26. You may not like what, how the president 
answered, you may think he tried to deceive, mislead the committee. 
This is not grounds for impeachment. I find it amazing. Democrats 
did win a small victory when the full committee deleted allegations 
from the final article that had charged the president with improperly 
asserting executive privilege and making false statements to the american 
people. But the debate was also about the significance of the committee's 
action. I've had knots in my gut all week because of this. I approach 
this, my friends, with a very heavy heart. And I'll have knots in 
my gut next week when we cast votes. I don't take it lightly. The 
committee also -- wrapped up its impeachment inquire. Democrats are 
pressing speaker elect Bob Livingston to permit the full house to 
vote on censure as an alternative. It's not, in my opinion, a matter 
for the house to decide. That censure, fine, expulsion, all of those 
are issues for the Senate to review and decide, in the event that 
the house sdiedz to offer the charge. The approval of a final article 
of impeachment brought a Condemnation of the White House that the 
pros Hess been neither fair nor bipartisan99 bipartisan. Still officials 
called on the full House of Representatives to keep an open mind when 
it gets down to the business next week of voting on whether to impeach 
the president. Carl rochele, CNN, Washington.
