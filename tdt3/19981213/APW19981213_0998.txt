The government condemned on Monday a 48-hour strike by the nation's 
coal miners, which has brought mining in Australia to a halt. Coal 
producers were likely to ask the Australian Industrial Relations Commission 
on Monday to declare the strike illegal and stop it. Mining companies 
estimate the strike will cost the industry 56 million Australian dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 34 million) in lost production. The government slammed 
the strike, called by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy 
Union to protest a deal which will cut the price of coking coal. ``This 
union is infamous for taking industrial action,'' Workplace Relations 
Minister Peter Reith told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. Reith 
said the coal industry had one of the highest levels of strikes, undermining 
Australia's reputation as a reliable and consistent supplier. ``The 
CFMEU are bloody-minded when it comes to the national interest, they 
undermine the interests of their own workers, they run a political 
agenda,'' he said. ``Now they want the Australian government to control 
the international price of a major commodity, obviously something 
outside our control,'' he said. But CFMEU mining division general 
president Tony Maher said the government had failed to address a general 
coal crisis that had sparked major job losses and is threatening more. 
He said the government had refused to protect Australia's national 
interest after companies Mount Isa Mines, Shell and the North Goonyella 
Mine offered a major cut in coking coal prices to overseas buyers. 
They had agreed to a U.S. dlrs 9 a metric ton, or 18 percent, price 
cut in coking coal, which is used to make steel. Steaming coal is 
used for electricity production. ``Coal is Australia's biggest export 
earner _ it earns 10 billion (Australian dollars) a year for the country 
so a 20 percent drop means 2 billion lost to Australia,'' Maher said. 
He said the price cut would mean further job losses in an industry 
already reeling from the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past 12 months. 
``For every mine worker lost, another three jobs are lost from the 
flow on effect _ that means 16,000 jobs lost,'' he said. ``Now there'll 
be many more on the scrap heap.'' Maher believes the problems in the 
coal industry stem from an oversupply of coal. ``There's 20 million 
ton excess capacity coming out of Australia,'' he said. ``We're allowing 
too many new mines to come on stream and the government just sits 
back and lets them open up new mines.'' Australian Coal Association 
spokesman Denis Porter said the association was still waiting for 
confirmation of the deal on a price cut for coking coal. He said the 
world market for coal remained tough and recent job losses were a 
sad but necessary part of the industry adapting and surviving in a 
very competitive world market.
