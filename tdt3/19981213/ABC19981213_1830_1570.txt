Finally, this weekend in Chicago, an old housing project came tumbling 
down, another implosion. Stacy loizeaux and her family have been imploding 
structures for more than half a century. More than 7,000 structures, 
in fact. So we decided to look at just what it takes to bring down 
a building from the "point of view" of a demolitionist, stacy loizeaux. 
The feeling you get watching a building come down is absolutely incredible. 
Your senses are picking up so many different things. The trick is 
to make the building fall where you want it to and how you want it 
to. And that is the secret sauce, I guess, of what we do, the timing, 
the placement. And it takes a lot of finesse. This particular project 
in Chicago, we're taking on four 17-story high-rise buildings. Throughout 
the four buildings, we've drilled approximately 2,700 holes. Throughout 
those, we will be putting in approximately 900 pounds of explosives. 
Also, we're using over 12,000 feet of detonating cord. The building 
naturally wants to fall a certain way, we're just gonna help it go 
in the direction we want it to. Now I'm going to move back and begin 
the wiring portion. And what that entails is actually physically connecting 
each one of these individual charges together so that we have one 
complete circuit that we can then push one button and detonate the 
entire complex. There's definitely a certain level of respect that 
comes along with the job of implosion. I mean, what we're doing is 
very physical work. Very long hours, very late nights. People consider 
us sort of the traveling executioners. And a lot of times we get blamed 
for take the buildings out of their misery. But they have to, I mean, 
when something becomes unsafe, or it becomes too costly to renovate, 
there's no other way to do it. I'm gonna push it on two. Nine, eight 
-- I think the thing about implosion that draws a crowd and keeps 
drawing crowds is that it is so unbelievable to stand there and watch 
a building melt right before your eyes. At the end of the day, when 
the building's on the ground and everything's going well and our client's 
happy, there's such a sense of pride -- such a Sense of relief, almost. 
We got another one down. And it's incredible. A "point of view" from 
demolitionist stacy loizeaux.
