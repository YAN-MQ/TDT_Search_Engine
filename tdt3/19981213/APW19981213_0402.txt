Lew Grade, cigar-chomping, legendary entertainment tycoon who founded 
Britain's first independent television company and whose projects 
included the TV series, ``The Saint,'' and the movie ``On Golden Pond,'' 
died Sunday. He was 91. Lord Grade died of heart failure at the London 
Clinic, a private hospital which he entered two weeks ago for surgery, 
his spokesman Dennis Michael said. His wife, Kathie, who he married 
56 years ago, and their adopted son, Paul, were at his bedside. Grade, 
the son of immigrants from Ukraine, was raised in London's East End. 
He gave up an early career as hoofer to start a small showbiz agency 
office in 1934. Twenty-one years later _ and a lineup of contracts 
with stars who included Edith Piaf, July Garland, Mario Lanza and 
Bob Hope _ Grade founded Associated Television, the first commercially 
funded channel launched to face the formidable competition of the 
British Broadcasting Corp. Grade, who was knighted in 1963 and given 
a life peerage in 1976, never stopped working. His last movie, a weepy 
called ``Something To Believe In,'' was made this year _ and panned 
by most critics. For more than 70 years, Grade rode showbiz rapids 
_ with a string of TV hits, some movie flops, fantastic deal-making 
skills, and memorable one-liners. Of perhaps his most expensive box-office 
flop, ``Raise the Titantic'' which cost 18 million pounds (dlrs 30 
million) to make in 1980, he quipped, ``It would have been cheaper 
to lower the Atlantic.'' Through ATV and later companies, Grade brought 
to millions a string of TV shows that became household names. They 
included ``Jesus of Nazareth,'' directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1975. 
His current company, The Grade Company, co-produced ``Starlight Express'' 
on Broadway in 1985. Louis Winogradsky was born on Christmas Day 1906 
in Tokmak, Ukraine, and came to London at the age of six. The family 
became a British showbiz dynasty. His brother, Bernie, later made 
a peer as Lord Delfont, was the first was head of EMI, a music and 
electronics business that is now Thorm-EMI Plc. His nephew, Michael 
Grade, the son of another brother, Leslie, is the chief executive 
of Britain's Channel 4 television network. After school, as Louis 
Grad he took up dancing, becoming in 1926 the World Charleston Champion 
in 1926. In 1929 a French journalist misspelt his name _ and Lew Grade 
stuck. Tributes poured in to his populist zeal, his colorful personality, 
his rapid-fire decision-making, and his sheer love of entertainment. 
``He was part of the great entrepreneurial group of Jewish entrepreneurs 
who went to Hollywood, or in his case, stayed in England of course, 
and ran the show immensely (well) privately and personally,'' British 
film producer Michael Winner said Sunday. His expansion in the agency 
business included taking over Leslie's agency in 1943. Two years later 
it was the biggest in Europe after William Morris. ATV dominated much 
of British popular television through the 50s, 60s and 70s. Shows 
included ``Robin Hood,'' ``Emergency Ward 10,'' _ Britain's first 
twice-weekly soap, ``The Saint'' starring Roger Moore, ``The Prisoner,'' 
``Coronation Street'' and the ``Muppets.'' At the age of 71 he lost 
control of ATV (now Independent Television) _ and turned to movies. 
He is survived by his wife, the former Kathleen Moody, his son, and 
two grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were not announced immediately.
