Lew Grade, an immigrant from the slums of London's East End who rose 
to become Britain's biggest impresario of popular entertainment, died 
here Sunday at the age of 91. Founder of Britain's first commercially 
financed television company, Lord Grade, who was knighted in 1963 
and given a life peerage in 1976, demonstrated his affinity for the 
common touch as much with his buoyant personality as with his TV series 
and movies. His balding profile, with a trademark 9-inch cigar clenched 
in his teeth, inspired the affection that the jowly silhouette of 
Alfred Hitchcock once did. A set piece of London film premieres was 
Lord Grade emerging in a wreath of smoke from his 1971 Phantom Six 
Rolls-Royce. He demonstrated a talent for reinventing himself, springing 
back from defeat and dispelling doom with humor. When one of his biggest 
gambles, the $30 million movie ``Raise the Titanic'' sank under the 
weight of dismissive reviews in 1980, he famously said, ``It would 
have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic.'' Lord Grade, who broke into 
show business as a champion charleston dancer in 1926, was until last 
month still showing up for 10-hour workdays and lighting the first 
of his seven daily Monte Cristos in his office at 7:30 a.m. He was 
born in 1906 to Golda and Isaac Winogradsky in the Ukrainian town 
of Tokmak. He was 6 when his Jewish family fled czarist Russia for 
London's East End. At 14 he left school and joined his father in the 
rag business. He pursued dancing to the stage of the Albert Hall, 
where in 1926 he won a contest and became the Charleston Champion 
of the World. For the next five years he worked as a hoofer, performing 
throughout Europe. A knee ailment ended this early career, and in 
1934 he embarked on another, joining his brother Leslie in founding 
the Grade Organization, which became the biggest show-business agency 
in Britain. Lord Grade was responsible for booking people like Bob 
Hope, Jack Benny, Judy Garland, Mario Lanza and Danny Kaye into the 
London Palladium. In 1955, he founded Associated Television, the first 
such commercially financed company in Britain, to compete with the 
British Broadcasting Corp. From the outset, he aimed at providing 
more lighthearted entertainment than the BBC offerings, and later, 
when commercial television expanded into serious undertakings, Lord 
Grade's end of the business was thought of cozily by Britons as the 
``song and dance'' side. Associated Television became Associated Communications 
Corp., an international group with 5,000 employees and annual turnover 
of $420 million, but he lost control in 1982 in a bitter dispute with 
the Australian financial entrepreneur Robert Holmes a Court. He became 
chairman and chief executive of Embassy Communications International, 
the London headquarters of Embassy Communications, a group of entertainment 
companies based in Los Angeles. When Coca-Cola bought Embassy, Lord 
Grade set up Grade Co., which was the co-producer of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber's ``Starlight Express'' on Broadway. He was also elected a 
vice president of the Loews group of movie theaters. He produced some 
of the most popular television shows on both sides of the Atlantic, 
including Britain's first twice-weekly soap opera, ``Emergency Ward 
10,'' ``The Muppets,'' ``The Saint,'' ``The Persuaders,'' ``Robin 
Hood,'' ``Sunday Night at the London Palladium,'' ``Coronation Street'' 
and ``Space 1999.'' Movies he produced included ``The Muppet Movie,'' 
``On Golden Pond,'' ``Sophie's Choice,'' ``The Eagle has Landed'' 
and two Pink Panther films. The Grade family came to dominate show 
business in Britain. Lew Grade's younger brother Bernie, also a lord, 
was head of EMI and then became chief of Trusthouse Forte's leisure 
division, which he bought out in 1983 to form First Leisure Corp. 
Michael Grade, Leslie's son, cut a swath through British television, 
becoming in turn director of programs for London Weekend Television 
and the BBC, and finally the chief executive of Channel 4. Lord Grade 
is survived by his wife, Kathie; a son, Paul; and two grandchildren. 
Marcia Stanton, Lord Grade's assistant for the past 35 years, said 
Sunday that her greatest recollection would be her boss's humor. ``He 
was asked at a public event what he wanted on his gravestone,'' she 
said. ``Quick as a flash he replied, `I don't want to go.'''
