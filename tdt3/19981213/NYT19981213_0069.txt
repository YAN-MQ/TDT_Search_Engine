Jeffrey Katzenberg was talking about the film that has consumed him 
for nearly five years. ``You can't do in `Prince of Egypt' what you 
did in `Little Mermaid' and `Beauty and the Beast,''' said Katzenberg, 
referring to two of the animated hits that stamped his career as president 
of Walt Disney Studios. ``There are no dancing teapots here, no cute 
little cuddly animals or outrageous sidekicks,'' he said. ``There 
are no cheerful musical respites. This is not a cartoon. Nobody does 
those movies better than Disney. Had we tried, the best we could have 
done would have been Avis to their Hertz. So why try?'' Katzenberg, 
long departed from Disney in a hugely bitter divorce and now a co-owner 
of Dreamworks, made his comments early the other morning at a coffee 
shop in a Pasadena hotel before talking up ``Prince'' with reporters 
for religious publications. Opening on Friday, ``The Prince of Egypt,'' 
a $75 million (and that may be a low figure) animated version of the 
biblical saga of Moses, has been lavishly promoted and widely anticipated. 
Not only is ``The Prince of Egypt'' a significant animated undertaking, 
but the film is viewed by agents, producers and rival studio executives 
as a test of how Katzenberg would pursue animation on his own after 
shepherding its revival at the traditional center of gravity, Disney. 
What makes Dreamworks executives nervous _ and what fascinates rivals 
at Disney and the rest of Hollywood _ is that Katzenberg has helped 
shape a somber musical saga designed for adults and children who are 
not toddlers. Beyond this, Katzenberg said, perhaps grandiosely, that 
he had sought to put animation to different uses and make a film that 
borrows far less from Disney and its cartoon tradition and far more 
from David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' and even, in some ways, 
from the French impressionist Claude Monet and from the biblical etchings 
of the 19th-century illustrator Gustave Dore. ``Maybe it's too extreme, 
maybe we've gone too far, maybe the big idea doesn't work,'' said 
a nervous Katzenberg, a founder of Dreamworks with Steven Spielberg 
and David Geffen, describing the film that is certainly the biggest 
risk of his career. Preparing for the film, Katzenberg and his team 
of artists and animators visited Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula and 
then sought to create an animated style that, they hoped, differed 
from Disney's. Faces were elongated to make them more realistic and 
expressive. As in any animated film, extraordinary attention was paid 
to the movie's palette. But the contrasts in ``The Prince of Egypt'' 
are striking. The pharaoh's palace is splendid and chilly, all white 
and light pastels, in contrast to the warm, burnished colors of the 
modest dwellings of the Israelites in Goshen. ``The world of the Hebrews 
is more organic,'' Richie Chavez, the film's art director, said in 
the movie's production notes. ``We gave Goshen more of a rounded, 
eroded look because the homes were made of mud brick, which is weathered 
by the rain, the wind and the sand. The homes are asymmetrical and 
out of kilter to give them a flow and ebb that the angular Egyptian 
side doesn't have.'' The faces of the Egyptian characters are more 
sculptured in appearance, with chiseled features; the Israelites are 
more curved and their shapes are looser. Katzenberg said that animators 
and artists on the film had seen ``Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962) numerous 
times, but that he had asked them not to see Cecil B. DeMille's ``Ten 
Commandments'' (1956). ``I didn't want them intimidated, because the 
images in that film are so powerful and so strong,'' he said. Katzenberg 
has already consulted about 700 Bible scholars, Egyptologists, divinity 
school teachers and religious leaders including the conservatives 
Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. They were consulted on everything 
from the costumes to the compression of the story into 90 minutes 
to making sure the Bible tale was being retold in a way that would 
not offend Christians, Muslims or Jews. Although Wal-Mart is promoting 
the film in its stores, Dreamworks has decided against arranging fast-food 
tie-ins and toy spinoffs, in deference to the subject matter. So far, 
Wal-Mart has sold 600,000 advance tickets to the film. ``We tried 
to be uncompromising here _ there's nothing cute and adorable in the 
film,'' Katzenberg said. ``In other words, we didn't make the camel 
funny. You know how easy it is to make a camel funny? Trust me, there's 
no animal on this planet that's funnier than a camel. We thought of 
it. We dropped it.'' On a personal level, Katzenberg is plainly seeking 
to prove two things to his former boss, Michael Eisner, chairman of 
Walt Disney. One is that the company's huge success in animation with 
films like ``The Little Mermaid,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Aladdin'' 
and ``The Lion King'' was largely due to him. The second is that he 
could take animation to a new level. (Disney remains, of course, the 
dominant studio for animation, and its most recent film, ``A Bug's 
Life,'' made with Pixar, is one of the year's biggest successes.) 
Eisner refused to promote Katzenberg from his studio chief's job to 
the president of the company in 1994, forcing him to leave. In a contentious 
legal battle, Katzenberg sued Disney and said he was owed 2 percent 
of the profit, or about $250 million, from the projects he oversaw 
in his decade at the company. Both sides said the lawsuit had been 
settled, but the financial details are still unresolved. Katzenberg 
said he had ``a fantastic partnership for 19 years'' with Eisner. 
He added, ``He clearly brought out the best in me, and I like to think 
I was a pretty good partner to him.'' The departure, he insisted, 
was actually a blessing in disguise. ``The great fortune for me is 
I moved on to something better,'' Katzenberg said. Katzenberg said 
he had not read Eisner's recently published memoir, ``Work in Progress'' 
(Random House), written with Tony Schwartz. In the book, Eisner said 
that Katzenberg was overly aggressive and not especially suitable 
to hold the No. 2 job at the corporation. ``The Prince of Egypt,'' 
with original songs by Stephen Schwartz and music composed by Hans 
Zimmer, has an unusual top-tier cast of actors speaking the animated 
roles: Val Kilmer (Moses), Ralph Fiennes (Rameses), Michelle Pfeiffer 
(Tzipporah, who becomes the wife of Moses), Danny Glover (Jethro), 
Sandra Bullock (Miriam), Helen Mirren (the Queen). Though its cost 
has been estimated to be at least $75 million, computing how much 
is actually spent on an animated movie is often difficult. Both Katzenberg 
and Dreamworks have an enormous stake in ``The Prince of Egypt,'' 
partly because of the film's risks and cost but also because its release 
is probably more anticipated than even that of the Dreamworks drama 
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Dreamworks has already created a substantial 
animation division; its next major animated movie, to be released 
in two years, is ``The Road to El Dorado,'' a comedy-adventure in 
the style of ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' So far, the early 
reviews of ``The Prince of Egypt'' in magazines and trade papers have 
been good. ``Reviews are very important, and not necessarily for lavishing 
praise but also to inform an audience that, whatever the film's imperfections, 
hey, there's something new out there for you,'' Katzenberg said.
