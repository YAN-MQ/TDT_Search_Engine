A new film is taking a fictional look at what might have inspired 
William shakespeare to write his romantic works. Cynthia Tornquist 
reports. While Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck are an item off the 
set, on the set of "Shakespeare in love," it was another of the film's 
stars, joseph Fiennes, who got all the steamy scenes with the stunning 
blond. Who says Ben Affleck was on the set? He wasn't anywhere near 
the set when I was doing the love scenes. "Shakespeare in love" is 
a fictional tale about what happens when england's famous playwright 
suffers from writer's block. What's it called? What is the story? 
Well, there's this pirate. Joseph Fiennes, who is the younger brother 
of "English patient" star Ralph Fiennes, portrays the bard. The 28-year-old 
actor, who recently appeared in "Elizabeth," is emerging as a name 
to reckon with, despite comparisons to his older brother. Who knows? 
Or maybe there'll be another brother. There are seven of us in the 
family. I have a twin brother. Comparison are readily made between 
my twin and myself, and -- But he's not in the business. He's not 
in the business, he's very far removed. He's the only sane one and 
got out of it. Ben Affleck also makes an appearance, as an actor who 
tries to help Shakespeare get over his slump. What is the play and 
what is my part? But it's Paltrow's viola who gives Shakespeare his 
inspiration. Too bad she's about to marry a penniless aristocrat, 
played by Colin Firth. This was a dog-eat-dog world, incredibly, brutally 
competitive. He was marrying for advantage, and she was expected to 
do so as well. why me? It was your eyes. No, your lips. Was it one 
of those stage slaps, or was it a real wallop? I felt it. No, it was 
a stage slap. You roll with it. It takes Judi Dench as queen Elizabeth 
to straighten things out. I just longed to play the thin, tall, blond 
woman. Who doesn't look like an old bag. She concedes her costar seems 
to have a lock on that market. Cynthia Tornquist, CNN entertainment
