Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said Sunday he is hopeful his country 
will be admitted to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 
time for him to attend a summit this week as a full-fledged member. 
``Yes, I hope, I hope,'' he told reporters after arriving and immediately 
starting a round of meetings to rally support. And while Hun Sen said 
he realizes the decision is beyond his control, Philippine Foreign 
Secretary Domingo Siazon said his presence ``could conceivably help 
his chance of getting into ASEAN.'' Cambodia's admission has been 
a hot topic at pre-summit meetings. ASEAN foreign ministers said after 
discussing the issue over dinner Friday that they could not reach 
a consensus and would leave it up to their leaders to decide. Cambodia 
was originally scheduled to join the grouping in July 1997 along with 
Laos and Myanmar, but its admission was delayed after Hun Sen ousted 
his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a violent coup. 
Following a close election this July, Hun Sen and Ranariddh settled 
their differences last month and formed a coalition government. Hun 
Sen was made sole prime minister in the deal and the prince was named 
president of the National Assembly. Vietnam, host of this year's ASEAN 
summit, has spearheaded the effort to get its neighbor accepted this 
time. However, the foreign ministers of the Philippines, Singapore 
and Thailand stuck to their views that Hun Sen's coalition with his 
former enemy must prove stable first, saying loose ends remain, including 
a controversial plan to form an upper house of Parliament in Cambodia. 
If Cambodia is allowed to join now, Siazon said, it might not complete 
its reforms and ``politicians might feel that it's OK to go back to 
their old ways and maybe even begin killing again.'' But Indonesian 
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, whose country supports Cambodia's entry, 
said its political reforms are its own internal problem. ``Indonesia 
believes that we should be consistent. We in ASEAN have always said 
that we don't interfere in internal affairs,'' he said. Before leaving 
Phnom Penh, Cambodian Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Ouch Kim 
An said it would be disheartening and potentially damaging for Cambodia 
to have its membership application put on hold for the second time 
in as many years. ``We will be disappointed if we will not be admitted 
because we have been prepared for more than a year to enter ASEAN,'' 
he said. ``It is economically important for us to be a part of ASEAN. 
We cannot be isolated.'' Hun Sen's arrival caused a media stir Sunday 
that ended with a security guard knocking over a lamp that hit the 
Cambodian leader on the back of the neck. Hun Sen did not appear to 
be injured in the incident at the Sofitel Metropole, where he is staying 
while having meetings over the next two days on the sidelines of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.
