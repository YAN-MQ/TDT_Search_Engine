The New England Patriots yielded to a rebellion by Connecticut lawmakers 
Sunday and agreed to concessions in the proposed contract for moving 
the team to Hartford, prompting legislative leaders to predict that 
the deal would sail through the General Assembly in a special session 
on Tuesday. Patriots officials had maintained as recently as Wednesday 
that they had given all the ground they planned to when they negotiated 
the original proposal with Gov. John Rowland last month. Legislative 
leaders met at the governor's mansion for more than five hours Sunday, 
hashing out the fine points of the new agreement, which the Patriots' 
owner, Robert Kraft, endorsed over crowd noise as he talked to Rowland 
from a skybox in St. Louis, where his team was playing the Rams. The 
new terms reduce the state's potential payments, if luxury seats and 
suites go unsold, from $17.5 million a year to $13 million a year. 
Connecticut officials said that considering inflation, the state's 
potential liability for the guarantees over the 30 years of the lease 
had been $1.4 billion _ a figure that had never been disclosed but 
that now has been cut by $356 million. ``We've made huge, huge movement 
on this,'' Rowland said Sunday afternoon on the front porch of the 
Executive Mansion. ``Is it a good deal for him? It probably is _ I 
don't think he'd be doing it, otherwise. But I think it's a darned 
good deal for us.'' Rowland said that besides reducing the state guarantees, 
Kraft would slash the price of the stadium's 6,000 club seats by $1,000 
a year, to $4,000 per seat per season, which state officials said 
would increase the likelihood of a sellout. A consultant's report 
prepared for the state concluded that the original prices for boxes 
and club seats would have been, on average, among the highest in the 
National Football League. The Patriots also agreed to pay any overruns 
if the cost of building the stadium exceeds $375 million, and agreed 
to pay a tougher penalty if they leave Connecticut before the 30-year 
lease is up. Rowland and Kraft reached a consensus on the changes 
during a meeting at the Capitol Friday night. The Senate leader, Kevin 
Sullivan, said the changes were the result of pressure from rank-and-file 
legislators, who in turn had received many complaints from constituents. 
``For the first time today, I think I feel confident that it will 
pass in the Senate,'' he said. House Speaker Thomas Ritter said the 
changes were possible because Connecticut residents had expressed 
such enthusiasm for the Patriots, in part by requesting thousands 
of season-ticket applications. ``The residents of Connecticut made 
this a better deal because the Kraft family understands how they'll 
be embraced, and they don't feel the need to have those same kind 
of guarantees as they had earlier,'' Ritter said. The reduction in 
the luxury guarantees cuts the state's potential expense for the project 
over 30 years to about $1.5 billion, from $1.9 billion. That includes 
$1 billion for the guarantees, $375 million to build the stadium, 
a $115 million fund to pay for major repairs and $15 million for a 
training center. Both Kraft and the governor said they hoped that 
sales would be brisk enough that the state would never have to pay 
any guarantees. Several powerful lawmakers had been concerned about 
what would happen if the team left before 30 years was up. Rowland 
said the Patriots now would have to pay off the remaining cost of 
the bonds sold to pay for construction of the stadium, and would have 
to pay the state the money it would have received from the 10 percent 
ticket tax during the rest of the lease. Rowland said the exit penalty 
would ``run up into the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.''
