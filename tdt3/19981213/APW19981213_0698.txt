Using a pebble from Wye River, President Bill Clinton paid respects 
Sunday at the grave of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, 
whose 1993 agreement with the Palestinians paved the way for the one 
his successor sealed at the river's shores. Clinton visited the grave 
in Har Herzl Cemetery with Rabin's widow Leah Rabin and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. The president, wearing a navy blue yarmulke, and the first 
lady, clutching a bouquet of pink flowers, knelt and bowed their heads. 
Clinton briefly traced the black-and-white tombstone with his fingers, 
then placed the smooth gray stone on it in keeping with the Jewish 
tradition of remembrance of the dead. Mrs. Rabin placed a bouquet 
of white flowers on the grave and stepped away hand-in-hand with Mrs. 
Clinton. The Rabins' daughter Dalia Pilosoph and granddaughter Noa 
Pilosoph, also placed stones on the grave. White House officials said 
the stone Clinton used came from the Wye River area of Maryland, site 
of the conference center where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reached their peace accord. Rabin 
was assassinated in Tel Aviv on Nov. 4, 1995, by an ardent Israeli 
opponent of the policy of relinquishing land to the Palestinians. 
At the Wye talks, Netanyahu agreed to give up another 13 percent of 
the West Bank. Rabin's grave, nestled among those of other Israeli 
presidents and prime ministers, is a popular pilgrimage site. Mourners 
routinely place candles, flowers and other mementos there. The visit, 
described as a personal one, was Clinton's second since Rabin's funeral.
