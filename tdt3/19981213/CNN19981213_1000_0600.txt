Many people use aspirin to treat all kinds of ailments. But studies 
show it can also cause serious problems if you're not careful. Dr. 
Steve Salvatore explains. It's been called a "wonder drug," partly 
because aspirin is cheap and effective. But it's also very powerful 
and should be used with caution, because aspirin can increase the 
risk of stroke in some patients. At this point, you're probably confused. 
Aspirin is supposed to help prevent a heart attack and stroke. And 
it does. But there are two different types of stroke. Aspirin can 
reduce your risk of one type, but may increase your risk of the other. 
A stroke occurs when the brain doesn't get enough oxygen. About 85% 
of the time it's due to a blockage, like a blood clot, which blocks 
the flow of blood and oxygen to brain cells. 15% of the time a stroke 
can occur from bleeding into the brain. Researchers say the risk of 
that kind of stroke, called hemorrhagic stroke, can be increased with 
aspirin. The biggest concern we have with aspirin is that it can cause 
bleeding. Bleeding in the stomach, as a result of irritation of the 
lining of the digestive tract, and it seems as well, bleeding in the 
brain. So an aspirin a day may not be for everyone. In populations 
where the risk of heart attack is low, but hemorrhagic stroke high, 
the risk benefit equation that we use in deciding whether to use a 
medication, may be different. And experts say, just who's at greatest 
risk still isn't clear. We need to come further to understand which 
people are at greatest risk of bleeding complications in the brain 
if they take an aspirin. It's still a good idea to take at least a 
baby aspirin a day if you've had a heart attack in the past or suffered 
a ministroke. But doctors warn, you shouldn't make that decision on 
your own. Talk with your doctor first to determine your own individual 
risks. Dr. Steve Salvatore, CNN, New York.
