Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Sunday defended the increasing use of video 
surveillance, saying that residents have been clamoring for more security 
cameras to watch out for crime in public spaces. Giuliani was responding 
to a study released over the weekend by the New York Civil Liberties 
Union, which found that at least 2,397 surveillance cameras were trained 
on public streets, sidewalks, buildings and parks in Manhattan. The 
study recommended that the city regulate the use of surveillance cameras 
to make sure they do not unnecessarily violate people's privacy. But 
the mayor said the city was careful not to use video surveillance 
too liberally. Of the 2,397 surveillance cameras counted in the study, 
only about 400 were operated by government agencies. The rest were 
operated by private organizations. ``The fact is that we use cameras 
very modestly,'' Giuliani said Sunday when asked about the study at 
a news conference. Giuliani also said that video surveillance had 
become an effective and popular crime-fighting tool in public housing 
projects, where the city began installing cameras last year. Only 
three of the city's 342 housing developments have surveillance cameras 
so far, said Hilly Gross, a spokesman for the city's Housing Authority. 
But the Police Department is planning to install cameras at six more 
developments next year as part of a pilot project, he said. Installing 
surveillance cameras in housing projects extends to some of the city's 
poorest residents a security measure enjoyed by residents of luxury 
apartment buildings, Giuliani said. He said the city had surveyed 
residents of housing projects and found that 85 percent were in favor 
of video surveillance. Norman Siegel, the executive director of the 
New York Civil Liberties Union, said his group did not want to abolish 
video surveillance, but rather to encourage public discussion of it. 
The city should limit how long material recorded by surveillance cameras 
could be kept before it is destroyed, he said. It should also limit 
access to material recorded by surveillance cameras, and require that 
signs be posted near all such cameras to warn people that they are 
being watched, Siegel said.
