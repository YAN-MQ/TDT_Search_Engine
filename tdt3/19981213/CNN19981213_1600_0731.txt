The celebration of hanukkah begins at sundown tonight, lasting for 
eight days. The lighting of the menorah is the major ritual of the 
holiday,commemorating the liberation of Jerusalem and its temple from 
the greeks. The most frequent translation of hanukkah is dedication 
for the rededication of the temple. Each night one light is lit on 
the menorah until all eight are illuminated.
