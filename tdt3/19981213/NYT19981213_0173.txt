On Sunday morning at 7, the sky was still pitch black and Sam Sliman 
could see his breath as he unlocked the front door to the News Depot. 
He went to fetch the dolly to wheel in the Sunday newspapers, 310 
of them, The Repository of Canton, The Akron Beacon-Journal, The Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette and The New York Times, every one with the same basic 
lead headline screaming: House Votes Next on Impeachment! ``You know 
what's funny,'' said Sliman, a registered Republican who thinks that 
the House should impeach the president but that he should not be removed 
from office. ``I went to two Christmas parties last night and no one 
was talking about impeachment. They talked about whether the Indians 
should go after Roger Clemens, they talked about Kevin Brown's $100 
million contract with the Dodgers.'' It's not that they don't know 
or don't have opinions. In fact, in conversations with several dozen 
customers who had come downtown to pick up their Sunday papers it 
is striking how much people do know about impeachment's fine points. 
As Stephen Goldberger, a businessman and registered Republican opposed 
to impeachment says, ``If you read 5 per cent of what's written, you 
know 100 per cent of what you need.'' It's more that the whole process 
has taken on a life of its own and seems surreal, far away, out of 
their hands, scripted and beyond their control. ``It's got a certain 
momentum all its own,'' says John Gray, a plant manager and Democrat 
opposed to impeachment. ``I feel like we're all standing here watching 
this snowball roll downhill.'' Even Ralph Regula, the local Republican 
congressman, a moderate who still has not announced his position on 
impeachment, has been surprised by how few calls he has personally 
received. When Tom Hannon, a state Republican leader and strong advocate 
for impeachment, came in to pick up his papers after 8 a.m. mass at 
St. John's, he was asked whether he had phoned Regula. ``You know 
I haven't,'' he said, ``and I should.'' Canton and surrounding Stark 
County is a political bellwether, a Northeast Ohio community that 
has consistently in the last several elections voted as the nation 
did for president, supporting the Republicans in the 1980s and swinging 
to President Clinton in the 1990s. For this reason, The Times did 
a series of stories here in 1996, when Stark voted for Clinton by 
an 8 per cent margin _ precisely his national margin of victory. While 
Clinton still seems to have considerable support here, at least among 
people picking up their Sunday papers at the News Depot, that support 
does not appear as strong as it was during a visit here in late September. 
Although it is still easier to find Republicans opposing impeachment 
than Democrats supporting it, on this visit, opinions seemed more 
closely divided along partisan lines. Says Sliman, who knows the political 
leanings of almost all his customers, ``As soon as they walk in, I 
can tell you what they'll say about impeachment.'' ``Good morning, 
Red,'' said Sliman. ``How you doing, big guy?'' ``Not bad for a poor 
boy,'' said Jack ``Red'' Mayle, a retired union steelworker. Asked 
his view on impeachment, Mayle said, ``It's wrong. I'm an African-American 
and I recognize a lynch mob when I see it.'' On the other hand Peter 
Voss, a retired chief executive officer of an engineering company 
who votes Republican, favored removing Clinton, saying it was strong 
medicine, but in the long run the country would be healthier for it. 
``This would be a definite signal to other officeholders that character 
does matter,'' he said. Roy Gutierrez, the former chairman of the 
Stark Democratic party who picked up a copy of the Plain-Dealer and 
fellow Democrat Bob Horowitz, the county prosecutor, getting his copy 
of the Beacon-Journal, supported the president, while Donna Shaheen, 
a retired office worker from Black McCuskey, one of the big corporate 
law firms in town, favored impeachment. ``He lied,'' said Ms. Shaheen, 
a Republican voter. ``If I had done what he did, I'd be in jail right 
now.'' Richard DeVaux, a private investigator, was one of the few 
Democrats interviewed who wanted the president out. ``He should be 
hung,'' said DeVaux. ``The idea that this is some woman thing is bull_ 
he lied under oath.'' But Jim Lockshin, a Republican-leaning businessman 
who has been coming into the News Depot for ``40 or 50 years,'' opposed 
impeachment, as did Les Walker, another Republican voter stopping 
by for his paper after the 8:30 service at Christ Presbyterian Church. 
``He did lie,'' said Walker, ``but they were asking him very private 
questions that most people would not admit to. If I was in that position, 
I think I'd be evasive, too. It doesn't seem of any danger to the 
nation.'' Rachel Schneider, a retired university instructor who votes 
Republican thinks he should be impeached, and face trial in the Senate, 
but is not sure there is enough evidence yet to merit removal. Still, 
she's hopeful they'll get him. ``I keep hoping they'll get some information 
out of Susan McDougal and Web Hubbell,'' she said. M.L. Schultze, 
the managing editor of The Repository, and her husband Rick Senften, 
the city editor, made their usual stop for three Sunday papers, after 
attending services at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. ``They had a special 
healing service this morning,'' said Ms. Schultze. ``There was a laying 
on of hands. Some asked for their arthritis to be healed, others asked 
for healing of the anger and fear that is going on in the nation now.'' 
While The Repository _ which endorsed Clinton twice _ was one of the 
first papers in the nation to call for his resignation, in recent 
weeks, says Ms. Schultze, its editorial stance has been less sure 
and Sunday's editorial was more neutral, acknowledging that the president 
had ``managed to maintain a leadership position much to the regret 
of his opponents and our surprise.'' The Plain-Dealer took a less 
generous view in an editorial headlined ``Impeach Him.'' ``Failure 
to impeach would even permit him to claim exoneration despite his 
obvious mendacity,'' said the paper, adding, ``Clinton trampled on 
the responsibilities of the presidency with self-centered disregard.'' 
For his part, Sliman felt that whatever the president's fate, the 
country would remain strong. Sliman left at 10 to go to mass at St. 
Peter's, saying he'd be back at 1 to close, and he was, right on the 
dot. ``Should I shut off the electricity?'' David Minor, a clerk, 
asked. ``I'll do it Dave; you can go,'' said Sliman. He removed the 
receipt tape from the register and turned off the power to the front 
display windows, stopping Santa's and Rudolph's heads from bobbing. 
There was still a big stack of Sunday papers left. ``People will pick 
them up on Monday when they come downtown to work,'' Sliman explained. 
One of the reasons for choosing to live in a place like Canton is 
that it isn't the worst thing in the world if you read Sunday's news 
a day or two late. Sliman was looking forward to Sunday dinner. His 
wife was cooking pork chops and mashed potatoes and at 4 p.m. they 
were going to his son T.J.'s basketball game. ``Things that really 
matter,'' said Sliman, turning off the lights.
