Hillary Rodham Clinton lit a Hanukkah candle, a Christmas tree and 
a Ramadan lantern Sunday as she promoted Jewish-Arab coexistence as 
the basis for a lasting peace. ``Religion should not be an instigator 
of war, but a bridge to peace,'' Mrs. Clinton told school children 
in Newe Shalom, a village tucked into a hillside west of Jerusalem 
where 36 Arab and Jewish families live together. Referring to the 
fragile Wye River peace agreement her husband helped negotiate and 
is now trying to rescue, Mrs. Clinton said that ``the strong belief 
that peace will prevail must once again be reinforced.'' The remarks 
were broadcast live by both Israeli television stations. At each stop 
of her tour, she was attended by a phalanx of Israeli reporters. Israelis 
have paid particular attention to Mrs. Clinton's remarks since May, 
when she told high school students in Geneva that she thought a Palestinian 
state would make for a stabler Mideast. The statement was disavowed 
by the White House. Israel says talk of Palestinian statehood is subject 
to final status negotiations. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has 
angered Israelis by saying he will declare a Palestinian state next 
year. Israeli reporters repeatedly asked Mrs. Clinton _ accompanied 
at each of her stops by Sarah Netanyahu, wife of the Israeli prime 
minister, whether she still endorsed a Palestinian state. She ignored 
the questions. ``The president's wife is here to see us, because there 
is peace here,'' said Manar Gabriel of Newe Shalom, a member of a 
fourth-grade dance troop bedecked with gold pantaloons and brightly-colored 
scarves. The Utopian settlement's teachings have failed to catch on 
in Israel, where Jews and Arabs live separately, and its teachings 
are anathema to Netanyahu's hard-line government _ a fact not lost 
on Rayek Rizek, the settlement's mayor. After praising Mrs. Clinton's 
interest in the village, Rizek turned to Mrs. Netanyahu and said: 
``It is no secret that the interest of the world in (Newe Shalom) 
has never been matched by a similar degree of interest here.'' It 
was a message subtly conveyed at all of Mrs. Clinton's stops. At a 
children's ward in Hadassah Hospital, she praised the hospital for 
treating all patients equally, regardless of their backgrounds, and 
made a point of meeting with both Jewish and Arab children. She especially 
praised the transplant work at the hospital, noting that organs had 
been transplanted from Arabs to Jews and Jews to Arabs. ``You are 
truly doing God's work by making us recognize our common humanity,'' 
she said. That irked David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu. 
``I was really surprised that the president's wife was surprised that 
so many patients at Hadassah Hospital were Arabs and that the exchange 
of implants was done regardless of whether the patients were Arabs 
or Jews,'' he told The Associated Press.
