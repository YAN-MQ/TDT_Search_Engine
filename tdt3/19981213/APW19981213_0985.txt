After successfully joining and outfitting the first two pieces of 
the international space station, Endeavour's astronauts set the seven-story 
complex loose Sunday and then flew away. They were sorry to go. ``Wish 
we could stay longer,'' commander Robert Cabana said, ``but we'll 
get safely away and leave it for somebody else to come back and add 
more to it.'' It will be spring before the next construction crew 
arrives. With the flick of a switch that released the snares holding 
them together, space shuttle Endeavour separated from the 77-foot, 
70,000-pound station and, with pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls, 
slowly backed away. Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow monitored 
the 245-mile-high action. The undocking, similar to those between 
space shuttles and Mir, occurred over Russian ground stations. The 
winged, cylindrical station glistened in the sunlight as the shuttle 
circled from a distance of 450 feet for a final photo survey. Once 
that was done, Sturckow fired Endeavour's thrusters and the shuttle 
pulled away for good. The astronauts could still see the station from 
more than eight miles out and excitedly beamed down pictures. ``It's 
the brightest new star on the horizon,'' Cabana said as the station 
grew smaller and smaller, its two components resembling the head and 
body of a snowman lying sideways. With Endeavour's flawless departure, 
NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle, was finally ready to declare 
the assembly part of the 12-day mission a success. ``I'm very, very, 
very gratified,'' Castle said. The undocking capped an intense week 
for Endeavour's six astronauts, who are due back on Earth late Tuesday. 
They captured Zarya, the Russian-built control module, and stacked 
it on the American-made Unity chamber in the shuttle cargo bay on 
Dec. 6, then conducted three spacewalks to wire the components together, 
install and fix antennas, and attach a tool box to the outside. They 
also spent a full day inside the station, sprucing it up for the first 
permanent crew, due to arrive in just over a year. Working quickly, 
they accomplished everything they set out to do and more. ``This has 
been a truly awesome experience,'' Cabana said. ``Words can't express 
how excellent this has all been. This is going to be one heck of a 
space station when we get it done.'' NASA plans four shuttle flights 
to the space station next year, starting in May, to haul up more equipment. 
Ten spacewalks will be conducted during those missions to attach more 
parts. The work level should crank up in 2000 and stay at a feverish 
pace until the last major component is launched to the station in 
2004. Much depends on the Russian Space Agency, broke as a result 
of Russia's economic collapse. NASA has forked over an extra $60 million 
to its leading partner in recent months in hopes of having a permanent 
control module flying by the end of next summer, more than a year 
late. Just in case, NASA is working on substitute modules.
