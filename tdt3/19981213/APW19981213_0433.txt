Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-Hwa was one of the first to congratulate 
Olympic windsurfer Lee Lai-Shan after she won its second ever Asian 
Games gold medal Sunday. Lee won Hong Kong's only Olympic gold medal 
ever when she claimed the event at Atlanta in 1996, but she said she 
might not try to defend the title in Sydney in 2000. ``I'm not sure 
if I will take part in the Sydney Olympics. I am lacking motivation 
at the moment,'' said Lee, 28, after adding the Asian Games gold to 
other victories in the world, European and Asian championships. But 
Sunday night was spent in celebration with Hong Kong sports officials 
and members of the yachting and rowing teams at Pattaya, the venue 
for the two sports. ``It was a very happy gathering, opening champagne, 
cutting cakes,'' said Pang Chung, the team's leader. ``She is our 
star.'' The former British colony of 6.6 million people, which was 
reintegrated into China last year, had won only one other Asian Games 
gold _ in bowling in 1986. Hong Kong's 297-member delegation is the 
biggest it has sent to an Asian Games. Hong Kong won 12 medals _ all 
silver and bronze _ at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 
1994. Despite its July 1, 1997, handover to Chinese rule, Hong Kong 
still competes separately from the mainland, under the title ``Hong 
Kong, China.'' Hong Kong also lifted a silver in the men's light raceboard 
competition as Wong Tak-Sum finished second to China's Zhou Yuanguo. 
Thailand snatched two golds through Suhaimee Moohammadkasem and Arun 
Homraruen, in the men's heavy raceboard and men's mistral events. 
China won the women's Europe class through Zhang Hong and also took 
the women's 470 competition. South Korea won in six of the 16 divisions. 
Singapore won its first two golds of these games, and Indonesia won 
one. Chae Bong-jin, in the men's Optimist, and Laser sailor Kim Ho-Kon 
won their events for South Korea while Indonesian Oka Sulaksana triumphed 
in the mistral heavyweight. Singapore claimed the men's and women's 
420 gold.
