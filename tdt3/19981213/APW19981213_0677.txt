Low turnout marked the second round of legislative elections Sunday 
in the Central African Republic, where the ruling party and the opposition 
are vying for control of parliament. International observers, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, estimated the turnout at 35-40 percent, 
though it was clear to journalists that few people turned out to vote. 
The run-up to the election has been marred by violence, including 
a Wednesday clash between supporters of the ruling party and the opposition 
that left six people wounded in Bangui, the capital. Fearing more 
violence, government soldiers and U.N. peacekeepers patrolled the 
city and polling places throughout the country, but there were no 
immediate reports of disturbances. Fourteen political parties, many 
of them set up along ethnic lines, are vying for the 63 seats that 
were not captured in the first round of voting on Nov. 22. Fifty-five 
seats are needed to take control of 109-seat parliament. Most of the 
parliamentary seats are now controlled by President Ange-Felix Patasse's 
ruling Movement for the Liberation of the People of Centrafrique, 
or MLPC. Following the first round of elections, eight opposition 
political parties stopped campaigning for seats, trying to focus opposition 
votes on the strongest parties. However, many voters appeared to be 
confused or angered by that decision, and may have stayed away from 
the polls as a result. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the Central African 
Republic fell under the tyrannical rule of former army Col. Jean-Bedel 
Bokassa, who was accused of corruption, murder, torture and cannibalism 
before being ousted in a bloodless coup in 1979. In his wake, the 
Central African Republic remains a troubled and isolated country that 
at times appears to be teetering on anarchy. Armed bandits frequently 
attack motorists and rival factions fight for territory. Since May 
1996, mutinous soldiers have staged three major rebellions against 
Patasse, whose election in 1993 ended more than a decade of army rule.
