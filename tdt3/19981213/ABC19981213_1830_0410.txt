There is no sign back in Washington today that the White House is 
winning converts in the House of Representatives, which decides this 
week whether mr. Clinton should become only the second president in 
history to be impeached. ABC's Karla Davis has the latest from the 
capital. Today Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde urged the president 
to do "the heroic thing and resign." If he cares about the country 
and I know he does, I think it would save the country a lot of turmoil 
and tumult. Americans oppose impeachment and favor censure, according 
to the latest ABC poll. But that is not swaying republicans in Congress. 
If Jesus Christ had taken a poll, he would have never have preached 
the gospel. Republican determination to rule out censure seems certain 
now that Robert Livingston, the incoming speaker of the house, has 
weighed in. A censure is a penalty, and it's not our job to assess 
penalties. Our job is simply to bring the charges or not bring the 
charges. Refusal to even consider censure has frustrated democrats. 
They're obsessed, apparently, with impeaching this president and dragging 
the country through this endlessly. Democrats are now looking for 
help from undecided republicans who say they are facing mounting pressure 
from both sides, including their own party. Although the majority 
whip denies twisting any arms. It is my job to gather intelligence 
and be the eyes and ears for the leadership. Mr. delay says his count 
indicates a 50-50 chance Mr. Clinton will be impeached. And with the 
issue scheduled to hit the house floor in just three days, both sides 
are trying frantically to change the odds. Karla Davis, ABC News, 
Washington.
