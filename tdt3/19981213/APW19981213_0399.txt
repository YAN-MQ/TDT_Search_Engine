MARMARA EREGLISI, Turkey (AP) _A U.S. envoy in Turkey to renew U.S. 
support for a proposed Caspian oil pipeline on Sunday joined Turkish 
leaders to inaugurate of a dlrs 600 million natural gas processing 
plant. The joint U.S.-British-Turkish built plant, on the Marmara 
Sea coast, some 110 kilometers (miles ) west of Istanbul, transforms 
liquefied natural gas to produce 500 megawatt of electricity per year. 
``This is the largest U.S. investment in Turkey apart from defense 
contracts,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said at the inauguration 
ceremony. The U.S. envoy, Richard Morningstar, is scheduled to hold 
a series of consultations in the capital, Ankara, starting Monday, 
to strengthen a bid for the construction of a pipeline that would 
transport oil from the Caspian region through Turkey to the Mediterranean 
Sea. A consortium of international oil companies are reluctant to 
approve the proposed pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Ceyhan on 
Turkey's Mediterranean coast, because of the high cost of the project 
and uncertainty over how much oil the Caspian fields will produce. 
The U.S. envoy is scheduled to chair a meeting between U.S. ambassadors 
from Caspian oil producing countries meet with Turkish energy official.
