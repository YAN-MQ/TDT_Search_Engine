Former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet reportedly is accusing the 
British government of kidnapping him. London's "Sunday mirror" newspaper 
says Pinochet made the charge during an interview it conducted through 
one of his friends. The paper quotes Pinochet as saying his arrest 
is an act of "treason" that makes British prime minister Tony Blair 
"untrustworthy." A Pinochet adviser denies Pinochet gave the interview. 
Pinochet is under arrest in Britain. He is fighting extradition to 
Spain on charges of genocide, torture and murder.
