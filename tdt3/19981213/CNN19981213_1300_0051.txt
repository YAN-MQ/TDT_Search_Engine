Don't expect President Clinton to leave the White House volume tarly. 
The house of leaving office before his term expires has never crossed 
his mind, he says. He made the comment after a meeting with Benjamin 
Netanyahu in Jerusalem this morning. It was his first public reaction 
to the matter since the house Judiciary committee passed all four 
articles of impeachment against him last week. Mr. Clinton says some 
of his sworn statements may have been difficult or ambiguous, but 
that he did not break the law. I did not commit perjury. We had, if 
you go back to the hearing, we had four prosecutors two republicans, 
two democrats, one, the head of President Reagan's criminal justice 
division who went through the law in great detail and explained that. 
That it was -- this is not a perjury case and there was no credible 
argument on the other side. So I have no intention of doing that. 
The probability he may be impeached was a hot topic today. Dick Gephardt 
says if the issue goes to the Senate, more work on important matters 
will grind to a halt. Meanwhile republicans are questioning the legality 
of censuring him. The president's defenders would have us, as they 
are undermining the rule of law by wanting to treat the president 
differently than they treat any other American, they want to undermine 
the rule of law by undermining the separation of powers, and we're 
not interested. They have one vote. That is to impeach the president 
send the charges to the Senate for trial or not. A Senate trial, I 
think, will go on for a matter of months. I think they have to have 
a trial. The Supreme Court justice, chief justice will have to come 
over there every day and run that trial when we've tried federal judges 
in the past, it's taken three and four months. I can't imagine it 
could take any less than that. In the meantime, the country will be 
in suspended animation. All of the attention of the entire world will 
be on this trial. If you think the O.J. trial was, you know, attention 
gathering, wait till you see this. They will begin debating it Thursday.
