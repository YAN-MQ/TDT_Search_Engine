Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier returned to the top of the podium 
for the first time since the season began, winning a men's World Cup 
super-G on Sunday. After being shutout in North America then finishing 
a dismal 36th in Saturday's downhill, ``The Herminator'' finally displayed 
the form which led him to the World Cup overall, super-G and giant 
slalom titles last season. Maier's victory was convincing, the 26-year-old 
Austrian finishing over a second faster than his closest rival, teammate 
Stephan Eberharter. Maier charged down the wet, foggy Oreiller Killy 
course in 1 minute, 18.73 seconds, an impressive 1.18 seconds faster 
than runnerup Eberharter, who clocked 1:19.91. The winner of Saturday's 
downhill, Lasse Kjus of Norway returned to the podium for the second 
time this weekend, finishing third in 1:20.10. While Kjus's victory 
on Saturday ended a two-year winning drought, Maier's super-G win 
marked the Austrian's return to the top of the podium for the first 
time since winning the season opening giant slalom in Soelden, Austria, 
in October. Since then Maier, who dominated the circuit last season 
when he won 11 races on way to becoming the overall World Cup champion, 
had only a second place to show. At this point last season, his rookie 
year on the World Cup circuit, Maier had already collected a pair 
of victories and three other podium finishes in five races. After 
failing to place any skiers among the top-10 in Saturday's downhill, 
Austria's one-two finish on Sunday helped restore the nation's dented 
pride.
