Actor Bill Paxton has starred in some big hits at the box office. 
This holiday season, he is hoping two new projects will bring similar 
success. Anna Hovind reports. oh, my god. Look at this! Those are 
$100 bills. I bet did's drug money. That's stealing. He just wants 
to walk away from it. You work for the American dream, you don't steal 
it. "A simple plan" is the story of three men who face the moral dilemma 
about what to do with $4 million they find in the wreckage of a Small 
plane. For Bill Paxton, staring in the film is a dream come true. 
My dad sent me in book when it was in hard back. I never dreamed at 
the time I would get to play this. This whole experience has been 
a wish fulfillment for me. This is the second time Paxton has teamed 
up with Billy Bob thornton, having co-starred with him in the 1992 
film "one false move." Yeah, I think he's a fantastic actor, a very 
relaxed actor. It's like playing with a great tennis player. It just 
elevates your game as well. The past few years have brought great 
success for Paxton, starring in several box office hits, including 
"Apollo 13," "twister" and "Titanic." But he started off as more of 
a character actor. The past couple of years, I have been trying to 
do more leading men type work. That kind of calls for you to kind 
of -- it's usually not the acting that gets noticed. But it's a lot 
more subtler. I find it actually more challenging. Paxton has been 
busy. He has a second film opening this holiday season, "mighty Joe 
young." Nice monkey. joe, joe! Can't you get him to put me down? Joe, 
drop him. Did you see that? Did you see the intelligence? It's kind 
of like a miniature king Kong. I think the film will appeal to all 
age groups. Kind of 7 do 70. It appeals to the animal lover in all 
of us. "A simple plan" opens this weekend. "Mighty Joe young" hits 
the big screen Christmas day. Anna Hovind, CNN, reporting.
