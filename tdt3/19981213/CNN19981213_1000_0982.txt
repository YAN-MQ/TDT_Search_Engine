A single judge is mulling over the lawsuit that the U.S. government 
slapped on the richest man in the country. And his decision could 
shape the future of the entire computer industry. Peter viles recaps 
the trial of software magnate Bill Gates. He is the richest American 
since Rockefeller, and Washington is treating him exactly the same 
way. Just as the government sued to break up John Rockefeller's oil 
monopoly, this year, it took aim at Bill Gates' software empire. What 
this case has always been about is to make sure that there's competition 
in this critical American industry. The government claims Gates used 
his monopoly on operating systems for personal computers as leverage 
to dominate the Internet. Gates' competitors showed up as government 
witnesses. The Internet is far too important to mankind to let any 
one company dominate it. Microsoft lawyers, a small army of them, 
argued the government doesn't understand the software business and 
doesn't understand that business in general is not always friendly. 
You just heard an opening statement that was based entirely on loose 
and unreliable rhetoric and on snippets that were not in any sort 
of responsible context. The reluctant witness in all of this was Gates 
himself, who testified on tape and was by turns forgetful and evasive. 
I don't know what you mean, "concerned." What is it about the word 
"concerned" that you don't understand? I'm not sure what you mean 
by it. Is there a document where I use that term? There is no jury 
to weigh those words. This trial, and perhaps the future of the U.S. 
computer software industry, will be settled by one man, federal judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson. Peter viles, "CNN Financial News," New York.
