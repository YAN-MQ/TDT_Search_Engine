when we continue -- declaring open season on exiled dictators. okay, 
you probably think they look alike. but with gateway you get basic 
help over the phone for as long as you own it. after a month, you 
pay for it. here, you get a color printer. nope, not here. this one 
you can trade in toward the purchase of a new one after two years. 
yours forever. still think they look alike? we'll build you a pc 99 
like this one for $1,598 or $45 a month. call 1-800-gateway and get 
more out of the box.
