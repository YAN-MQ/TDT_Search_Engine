In the early 19th century, a critic wrote these words in the Edinburgh 
Review about a long-forgotten work of fiction: ``The main question 
as to a novel is _ did it amuse? were you surprised at dinner coming 
so soon? did you mistake eleven for ten? and twelve for eleven? were 
you too late to dress? and did you sit up beyond the usual hour? If 
a novel produces these effects, it is good; if it does not _ story, 
language, love, scandal itself cannot save it.'' Now, this is an ironclad 
measure of entertainment, but not of literature. It has the amiable 
demerit of allowing each reader to come to his own conclusions about 
the value of a novel, conclusions based on the reader's own capacity 
for literary seduction. The novels that induce this pleasant sensation 
of timelessness will be as different as the dinners that grow cold 
waiting for abstracted readers, as different, in fact, as the readers 
who at last put down their books and take up their forks. This standard 
easily encompasses works like Norman Mailer's ``The Naked and the 
Dead,'' John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom novels, and Tom Wolfe's new 
novel, ``A Man in Full,'' not to mention half the paperbacks embossed 
with deep decolletage. Updike and Mailer have recently stated in printed 
reviews that Wolfe's new novel is not literature, all the while admitting 
that ``A Man in Full'' satisfies the cold-dinner standard of amusement. 
The question naturally arises, why have they done this and what gives 
them the right? Had Mailer and Updike declared that ``A Man in Full'' 
was literature, they could not make it so. Not even Helen Vendler 
has that power. Like it or not, deciding what is literature is always 
a retrospective task, and the two months since Wolfe's book was published 
are not long enough to let posterity do its work. What Updike and 
Mailer offered were closely reasoned opinions, which are worth taking 
seriously because of their experience as readers. The fact that both 
men are also writers has almost nothing to do with the value of their 
opinions in this case, though it gives the resulting brouhaha a piquantly 
fraternal air. The question remains: Why have they done this? They 
did it because it was dead certain that Wolfe would claim ``A Man 
in Full'' is literature. He cannot make it so by fiat either. To borrow 
one of his own phrases, Wolfe has been mau-mauing the literati for 
the last 25 years. He has advanced in print and at length the argument 
that novelists need to take the broad sweep of society as their subject 
and to base their work on more extensive reporting. This argument 
is the rhetorical equivalent of wearing a white three-piece suit in 
public, a way of attracting attention. It is especially ridiculous 
in the context of this fracas with Mailer and Updike, much of whose 
work is as craftily and extensively reported _ as evocative of its 
moment _ as even Balzac could wish. Each of these three men has written 
works of literature. Dinners may go cold and readers may go hungry 
over ``A Man in Full,'' but Wolfe's most lasting writing has been 
in the genre of nonfiction. Ironically, like many writers, he has 
overvalued the novel by abandoning nonfiction, and, ironically, he 
has underestimated the extent to which all fiction, not just his own, 
is based on fact.
