Muslims living in Belgium went to the polls Sunday to elect a special 
executive council that will represent the Islamic religion in its 
relations with the Belgian authorities. After Roman Catholicism, Islam 
is Belgium's second religion, with some 350,000 Muslims living in 
this nation of 9.9 million. The majority of them are Moroccan and 
Turk, with about 10 percent naturalized or converted Belgians. The 
election comes 24 years after Belgium recognized Islam as an official 
religion in Belgium. The establishment of an official representative 
body however has been held back, partly because Islam does not have 
a strict hierarchical structure in Belgium as Roman Catholicism does. 
Observers said it was the first such election for Muslims in Europe. 
Some 74,000 Muslim voters will elect 51 representatives, who in turn 
will choose 17 members of an executive council. The lack of such a 
council has held back state subsidies, which already are granted to 
other religions. Results of the election were to be announced Monday.
