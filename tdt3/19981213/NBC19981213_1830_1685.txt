finally tonight, to space, the first stage of the space station on 
its own. nbc's rick davis. good night, sweetheart it's time to go 
it may seem an odd choice for the astronauts' wake-up call, but it 
carried two messages -- time to let go of the joined u.s. and russian 
compartments attached to the shuttle "endeavour." and then, time for 
the six astronauts to begin heading home. i'm afraid it is time to 
go. it's been a great stay up here. but we'll be ready. wish we could 
stay longer. this afternoon the crew detached the docking ring, and 
now the 7-story, 35-ton structure is on its own until july of 1999, 
when a russian-made temporary living module will be added. then, astronaut 
construction crews will be living in space, helping to add 100 sections 
around this hub. by 2004, after 40 more missions and 159 space walks, 
this will be the international space station, a joint effort of 16 
nations. and today, this is the beginning, in orbit, 245 miles above 
the earth. rick davis, nbc news.
