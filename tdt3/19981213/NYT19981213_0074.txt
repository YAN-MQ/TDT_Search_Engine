President Clinton may have left the United States on the heels of 
what one Israeli daily termed a congressional intifada, using the 
Arabic term for uprising. He may have suffered a lukewarm greeting 
from a reluctant host, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He may face 
uncertain success rather than the triumphant celebration of peace 
originally envisioned. But there is no question that Clinton is engaged 
in a critical salvage mission for the faltering peace effort, and 
that he has made himself an indispensable authority figure in the 
blood feud between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It may seem 
a peculiar role for him at this moment, given his domestic troubles, 
but here Clinton is staking out the moral high ground. On the eve 
of Hanukkah, a newspaper cartoon in the daily Yediot Ahrnoth depicted 
the American president as a burning candle who had come to ``dispel 
darkness'' _ as did the Maccabees in the revolt commemorated by the 
Festival of Lights. Indeed, when Netanyahu and Clinton addressed a 
convention hall filled with teen-agers on Sunday night, they were 
a study in contrasts, dark and light. In a calm but defensive speech, 
laced with attacks on the Palestinians, Netanyahu made clear to the 
youth of his country the mistrust that underlies his commitment to 
the peace effort. He said Palestinians could roam through Israel freely, 
visiting Tel Aviv or the beach at Netanya. In contrast, he said, ``Well, 
you can enter Gaza _ that's for sure _ but getting out of there, that's 
a different story.'' President Clinton, on the other hand, gave an 
uplifting, optimistically American speech. He made clear that he empathized 
with ``the history of heartbreak'' that defines Israeli-Palestinian 
relations, but he preached accommodation to immutable realities. ``One 
thing and only one thing is predestined,'' Clinton said. ``You are 
bound to be neighbors. The question is not whether you will live side 
by side, but how.'' On Israeli television, which carried the event 
live, when a commentator managed to speak above the din of cheers, 
he said the scene ``looked and sounded like a Democratic National 
Convention.'' Before Clinton's arrival, municipal workers hastened 
to scrape hostile posters from the city's walls: doctored photographs 
picturing the American president wearing an Arab head scarf, with 
the Hebrew caption ``I am a Palestinian.'' Members of Netanyahu's 
Cabinet had to be persuaded to refrain from expressing too loudly 
their displeasure at Clinton's visit, which is organized around a 
trip to Gaza on Monday for a meeting of the Palestine National Council. 
The Cabinet members, opponents of the peace effort, said they believed 
that his trip would come across as an endorsement of Palestinian sovereignty. 
They also clearly feared that it could repair the breakdown in relations 
between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But many Israelis, speaking 
privately, on the radio, or in newspapers, expressed embarrassment 
at the government's tepid if not hostile reception of an American 
president who is particularly popular in Israel and who is making 
his fourth trip here at a moment many perceive to be fateful. ``It 
is important for you to know that not all of us are deceitful,'' Meir 
Shalev, a novelist, wrote in a newspaper column. ``Not all of us are 
grave worshippers, not all of us are paranoid, not all of us are existential 
stones, not all of us are uncouth, thankless beggars.'' The newspaper 
Maariv dedicated its front page to a column by its editor in chief, 
Yaakov Erez, welcoming the ``leader of the free world.'' ``We all 
hope, save for the radical fringes, that Clinton will be able to bridge 
the abyss at our feet, exhibit his magic touch in his talks with Arafat 
and Netanyahu, and restore the hope of peace to our chests,'' Erez 
said. It is a tricky role for the American president, one setting 
what could be a dangerous precedent in a very rocky process. Clearly, 
the Americans have moved from mediators to overseers and guarantors 
of the peace effort. But it would soon become untenable if the Israelis 
and the Palestinians needed not only U.S. assistance but direct presidential 
intervention to clear the major bumps in the road. Clinton and Netanyahu 
were at odds on Sunday. After a meeting that lasted all morning, in 
which they reportedly spent only 10 minutes alone, they shook hands 
laterally, reaching across their bodies as both faced forward looking 
grim. They then presented different realities. In Netanyahu's report 
card on the implementation of the peace accord, the Israelis passed 
with flying colors and the Palestinians were completely delinquent. 
Using harsh language, he blamed Palestinian leaders for ``openly inciting 
violence and riots'' and for organizing violent demonstrations. He 
also said his own domestic political problems _ the fact that his 
government, hanging on by a thread, might benefit by lurching rightward 
_ played no role in the Israeli freezing of the implementation. In 
contrast, Clinton praised and condemned actions on both sides, although 
he did single out the recent unrest in the Palestinian territories. 
And he repeatedly referred to Netanyahu's ``political constraints,'' 
as well as to those of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Finally, 
Clinton repeatedly underscored the cash bounty waiting for the Israelis 
_ $1.2 billion in economic assistance, if Congress approves his request. 
Tethering the vaunted U.S. idealism, which some Israelis and some 
Palestinians believe to be diplomatic naivete, is the promise of a 
fat new American purse.
