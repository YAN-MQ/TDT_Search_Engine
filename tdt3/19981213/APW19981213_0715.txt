In a divisive election aimed at the U.S. Congress, Puerto Ricans voted 
Sunday on whether to petition for statehood in the country that colonized 
this Caribbean island 100 years ago. An extremely close race, Sunday's 
referendum pitted statehood advocates against defenders of Puerto 
Rico's status as a U.S. commonwealth, in which islanders are U.S. 
citizens but have no vote in Washington. ``We will be protecting the 
future of our children,'' said Ernesto Cabrera, 72, who said he marked 
statehood on his ballot soon after voting stations opened. Voting 
was to end at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT) and initial results were expected 
after 6 p.m. (2200 GMT). ``It's very important because today is the 
day that could decide what Puerto Rico desires. We have to demonstrate 
to the federal government what the people want'', said Juan Aponte, 
40, a pharmacy technician who worked until 2 a.m. but got up early 
to vote. Polls put both causes virtually even in the election, and 
heavy turnout was expected among 2.2 million registered voters. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result of 
the non-binding referendum. But mainlander Payton Lewis, a 51-year-old 
engineer from South Carolina who has married and settled on the island, 
confronted the 95-year-old founder of the statehood party, Luis A. 
Ferre, to say that Americans don't want Puerto Rico. ``I know my people, 
and Americans don't want Puerto Rico to be a state,'' Lewis, an election 
volunteer, told Ferre at a polling station in southern Ponce city.
