It took a little longer than expected, but Rickey Henderson and the 
Mets finally agreed Sunday on a one-year contract with a base salary 
of $1.8 million and an option for a second year. Henderson, who will 
turn 40 on Christmas, quickly showed he was just as brash as he was 
in his first stint in New York, when he starred for the Yankees from 
1985 to 1989. ``I would say the Mets are going to be the best team 
in New York right now,'' Henderson said from Oakland Sunday afternoon. 
``The Yankees have been cheering the crowd for a long time. It's about 
time for the Mets to take over.'' If Henderson, who is expected to 
play left field and bat leadoff for the Mets, reaches 500 plate appearances 
(he had 670 for the Oakland Athletics last season), the second year 
is guaranteed at $2 million. And with various incentives for games 
played and plate appearances, Henderson could earn another $500,000 
each year. Asked what he might be making in the currently fevered 
free-agent market if he were in his prime, Henderson _ probably grossly 
underestimating _ said $10 million. But what mattered most, he said, 
was winning. That and the career records for runs scored and walks. 
Henderson has the major league stolen base mark (1,297). With 2,014 
runs, he is sixth and trails the leader, Ty Cobb, by 232. With 1,890 
walks, Henderson is third behind Babe Ruth (2,056). He is within two 
years of both records. Even though he batted a career-low .236 last 
season, Henderson, who will be entering his 21st major league season, 
scored 101 runs and led the majors in both walks (118) and stolen 
bases (66) last season. ``I can still hit if that's what it calls 
for me to do,'' said the right-handed-hitting Henderson, who is a 
career .283 hitter. ``But in my game, being a leadoff hitter, hitting 
doesn't make a difference if you can get on base 40 percent of the 
time.'' And that is something Henderson has done like clockwork. His 
career on-base percentage is .404. Mets General Manager Steve Phillips 
called Henderson ``arguably the best leadoff hitter in the history 
of the game.'' His signing at the winter meetings here completed a 
revamped Mets lineup that will include the newly acquired Robin Ventura 
and Bobby Bonilla. Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, speaking from Texas, 
said of Henderson, ``He's as fine a player as I've ever had to manage 
against.'' The Mets have not had a prototypical leadoff hitter since 
before Valentine became their manager in August 1996. Henderson said 
he had not lost anything since his glory days. And he can obviously 
still run _ last year, he had four more steals than the entire Mets 
team. ``He can still get on base and he can still score runs,'' said 
Art Howe, his manager with the A's last season. ``And he's the best 
I've ever seen at working a count and making a pitcher work every 
ounce.'' Henderson led the major leagues last season in pitches seen 
during at time at bat (4.33) and total pitches seen (2,903). ``He'll 
affect the outcome of games,'' Valentine said. Henderson will become 
just the second Mets player to wear No. 24 since Willie Mays retired 
after the 1973 season. (The otherwise forgettable Kelvin Torve assumed 
it briefly in 1991.) Henderson would have preferred to end his career 
with Oakland, where it began (as Mays did in New York), and his agents 
also talked to San Francisco and Seattle. But the way Henderson was 
talking, the Hall of Fame can wait. ``I feel like I can play until 
I'm 50,'' Henderson said. ``I've got a few years left.''
