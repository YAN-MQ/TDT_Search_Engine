Fla riddians are remembering their governor. Only weeks before he 
was to leave office and enter retirement, governor lawton Chiles died 
of an apparent heart attack. He was dubbed walking Lawton for crisscrossing 
the state on foot during his first U.S. Senate campaign in 1970. He 
served 18 years as senator and eight more as governor. His daughter 
says he was more than just a great politician. I want you to know 
my family was even more blessed, because we were lucky to have him 
as a father. A teacher, and a grandfather for our children. Best of 
all, he was our friend. I can truly say our dad was the greatest friend 
we could ever have, and he was our hero. We're proud to have shared 
this man we loved so much with the people of florida. Florida's lieutenant 
governor, buddy mackay, has been sworn in as governor and will complete 
the remaining three weeks of Chiles's term.
