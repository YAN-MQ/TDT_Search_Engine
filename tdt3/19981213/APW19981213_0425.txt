Star tenor Luciano Pavarotti has canceled a planned appearance with 
the Berlin Philharmonic on New Year's eve, ZDF television said Sunday. 
A ZDF spokesman said Pavarotti had been advised by his lawyer to cancel 
the appearance because the tenor is being investigated in a tax evasion 
case in Germany. ``We are very disappointed by the cancellation.'' 
Pavarotti, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and star soprano Montserrat 
Caballe, were named as suspects last month for helping German concert 
promoter Matthias Hoffmann evade taxes. Mannheim prosecutor Hubert 
Jobski said there were signs that the four may have been involved 
in the case against Hoffmann, but that the investigation had only 
started and could take months. Hoffmann went on trial on fraud and 
tax evasion charges in October. He is accused of using unreported 
payments and shell companies in Ireland, London and elsewhere to evade 
almost 24 million marks (dlrs 15 million) in German taxes. Hoffmann, 
who has been in investigative custody since July 30, 1997 has organized 
concerts with the three tenors and Caballe.
