Voters in Puerto Rico are going to the polls today with the political 
future of their island in mind. They're deciding whether they want 
to become the 51st U.S. state. If the majority cast "yes" ballots, 
a long process could begin to convert the island from commonwealth 
status to statehood. But it's important to keep in mind that today's 
election is nonbinding, and congress has the final say on the island's 
future.
