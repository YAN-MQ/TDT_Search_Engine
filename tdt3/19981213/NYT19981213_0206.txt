Three New York students are among this year's winners of the British 
Marshall Scholarships, it is being announced Monday by the British 
ambassador, Sir Christopher Meyer. Two of the three, Tara Helfman 
and her classmate Joseph Stern, share the honor of receiving the first 
two Marshall Scholarships awarded to Queens College seniors. A history 
major at Queens College, Ms. Helfman plans to study for a doctorate 
in history at Cambridge as preparation for an academic career in history 
and a legal career in constitutional law. Stern, with a double major 
in mathematics and philosophy, plans to study pure mathematics at 
Imperial College, London, in preparation for doctoral work in the 
United States after he completes his Marshall scholarship. Eric Nelson, 
a history major at Harvard, is the third New Yorker to win the scholarship 
this year. He expects to study political thought and intellectual 
history at Cambridge. The Marshall Scholarships _ often equated in 
prestige with Rhodes Scholarships _ were established in 1953 by the 
British government as a gesture of thanks to the people of the United 
States for the assistance provided by the Marshall Plan after World 
War II. The scholarships provide an opportunity for American students 
who have demonstrated academic excellence and leadership potential 
to continue their studies for two or three years at a British institution.
