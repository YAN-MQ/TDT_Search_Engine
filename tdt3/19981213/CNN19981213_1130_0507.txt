This is meteorologist Valerie Voss with your "CNN Headline News Weather" 
forecast for today and into Monday. As one system continues to move 
across the northwest, producing rain, windy conditions and snow in 
the mountains, an area of low pressure will move slowly through the 
southeast so that by Monday evening there will still be some lingering 
clouds and showers through the carolinas, and Georgia. High pressure 
moves toward the northeast, it will be a little cooler, we'll look 
for quiet warmer weather through the plains and nice weather in the 
southwest. Today's highs, 30s and 40s northeast, also across the rocky 
mountains with some 60s and 70s in the south. Looking ahead to Tuesday, 
cool air pushes toward the plains states, with some snow showers in 
the upper midwest. That's what we'll see on Wednesday, with the coldest 
air around the Great Lakes. Then on Thursday, rain and snow in the 
northeast, 20s and 30s from the northern plains to New England. Remember, 
you can find four-day forecasts for more than 7200 cities on CNN interactive.
