Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell on Sunday called elections 
for Jan. 14 and urged supporters to rescue his embattled leadership, 
which is mired in charges of corruption. He said the deadline for 
filing as candidates will be Dec. 20. Elections are not legally due 
until June 2000. ``Go into the highways and byways and bring your 
members out to vote,'' he urged party leaders. Mitchell made the announcement 
during a rally of his New National Party in rural St. Andrew's Parish, 
where he outlined the main achievements of his party's 3 1/2 years 
in office. The New National Party lost its majority in parliament 
on Nov. 29, when his foreign minister and former health minister defected 
to the rival Grenada United Labor Party. During the rally, Mitchell 
touted public works projects including a dlrs 53 million national 
stadium, a new government office building and several road projects. 
``Make a choice between curse and blessing,'' Mitchell said. ``Choose 
the blessing of national development over chaos.'' But opposition 
officials say the projects have failed to create many new jobs and 
are inflating the island's national debt. Political analysts say the 
election could hinge on a corruption investigation involving Communications 
and Works Minister Gregory Bowen. Before resigning and reversing Mitchell's 
majority, former foreign minister Raphael Fletcher claimed an audit 
by accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick showed wrongdoing. The report 
pointed to contracts being given to contractors without a public bidding 
process. It also found that the ministry was paying ``exorbitant fees'' 
to these contractors. Bowen has denied any wrongdoing. Fletcher was 
named leader of the Grenada United Labor Party within days of his 
resignation from the government. Meanwhile, the opposition National 
Democratic Congress unveiled its slate of candidates in St. George's, 
the capital, and announced that party leader George Brizan will hand 
leadership of the party to his deputy, Joan Purcell. If the National 
Democratic Party wins the election, Purcell would become Grenada's 
first female prime minister. Brizan, a former prime minister, is recovering 
from a torn retina and complications from diabetes.
