Another day, another world record: so it goes for China's women weightlifters. 
What's more, the Chinese say they're not even trying. Ding Meiyuan 
broke two world records Sunday, completing another Asian Games gold 
medal sweep for China's strongwomen. It was the seventh straight day 
that China's women weightlifters have broken world records. It also 
was the third consecutive games that they have taken all the gold, 
following sweeps in 1990 and 1994, said head Chinese coach Han Guihua. 
Cui Wenhua gave China its fourth men's weightlifting gold here Sunday, 
lifting an Asian record total of 410 kilograms in the 105-kilogram 
division. Kazakstan's Anatoliy Khrapatyy took silver with 407.5 and 
South Korea's Choi Jong-kun won bronze with 405. What makes China 
so strong? Officials and lifters say that apart from having 1.3 billion 
people to choose from, China also has the advantage of a state-sponsored 
sports system, more than a decade of experience in the still developing 
sport of women's weightlifting and a 40-strong team of women, some 
from needy families, who are prepared to work harder than most for 
gold and begin training in some cases as young as age 13. ``We can 
eat more bitterness than foreigners,'' said Liu Xiuhua, a petite lifter 
who set a snatch world record of 83.5 kilograms _ close to twice her 
bodyweight _ in the under 48-kilogram division Monday. ``Weightlifting 
is a sport of poor people. They can cope with hardship and the monotony'' 
of weight training, added Wei Di, the team manager. ``All of our team 
members are from peasant families.'' The Chinese will get 2,000 yuan 
(dlrs 240) for each record, plus 10,000 yuan (dlrs 1,200) for their 
gold medals, said Wei. That is about three times more than many Chinese 
farmers earn in a year. Some Chinese weightlifters also have tried 
drugs: five were caught last year for doping offenses and punished, 
said Wei. He claimed that a Chinese black market for performance-enhancing 
substances is supplied by ``Americans who come to China especially 
to peddle drugs.'' In a measure of China's determination to stamp 
out the problem, new rules introduced at the start of the year impose 
a life ban on lifters who test positive for certain drugs, as well 
as their coaches, he said. He noted that the punishment is much harsher 
than the two-year ban demanded by the sport's governing body. This 
year, no lifters have failed doping tests, he said. The International 
Weightlifting Federation has conducted a minimum of three surprise 
tests this year on every member of China's Asian Games team, he added. 
As for the records, no one in the Chinese camp seemed very surprised. 
``They lift even heavier weights at home,'' said Wei. Some of the 
Chinese weightlifters ``haven't displayed their full strength.'' Ding, 
competing in the over-75 kilogram division, lifted 120 kilograms in 
the snatch, besting the 118.5 kilogram world record set by her compatriot 
Zhang Nan on May 24. She also jerked 150 for a combined 270 kilograms, 
breaking the 267.5-kilogram record set by China's Tang Gonghong on 
April 24. Mynamar's Aye Aye Aung got silver with a 252.5 total. Taiwan's 
Chen Hsiao Lien got bronze with 242.5. Wei predicted, however, that 
China's dominance will wane as other countries get stronger. Women's 
weightlifting will be included as an Olympic event for the first time 
in 2000 in Sydney, Australia, and Asian countries are piling resources 
into the sport in the hope of getting a medal, said Richard Crawley 
of the Thai Amateur Weightlifting Association. ``China's strength 
will gradually disappear,'' Wei said. ``By Sydney, all countries will 
be competing on an equal footing.''
