President Clinton is dealing with pressing international matters, 
despite his domestic political problems. He's in Israel, trying to 
keep the mideast peace process on track. This morning, he met with 
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Clinton is encouraging the 
Israelis and Palestinians to talk out their differences, instead of 
resorting to violence. The Israelis are accusing the Palestinians 
of inciting unrest and violating the wye peace accord. The Palestinians, 
meanwhile, are calling for Israel to release more palestinian political 
prisoners. Tomorrow, Mr. Clinton is scheduled to meet with Palestinian 
leaders in gaza.
