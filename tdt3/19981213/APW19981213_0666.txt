Britain's Mark Foster lowered his own 50-meter freestyle world short-course 
record of 21.31 seconds Sunday as the three-day European short-course 
championships ended with seven new world records and four new world-best 
times. Foster clocked 21.48 seconds in Sunday's preliminaries, surpassing 
the old record of 21.50 by Russian Alex Popov set in 1994. Several 
hours later he came back to win the final in an even quicker 21.31. 
``Watch this space,'' said Foster, who can be regarded as the world's 
fastest swimmer on the 25-meter indoor course. ``My next target is 
to go under 21 seconds.'' British teammate James Hickman also set 
a world record Sunday in the 100 butterfly. Hickman clocked 51.02 
in the prelims, bettering Australian Michael Klim's old time of 51.07 
set in January of this year. In the 50-meter backstroke, Germany's 
Sandra Voelker won in world-record time of 27.27, topping the old 
mark by China's Xiuyu Bia. Also on Sunday, the German women set a 
world-best time of 1:50.13 in the 4x50 medley relay. In the men's 
4X50 medley relay, Sweden and German tied for gold, both with world-bests 
of 1:35.51. Sweden had broken the world-best time in Sunday's prelims 
with a time of 1:36.24. The world-best designation is reserved for 
seldom swum events that do not have world-record status. On Saturday, 
Milos Milosevic of Croatia and Martina Moravcova of Slovakia set world 
records and the Netherlands' 4x50 men's relay set a world-best. Milosevic 
swam 23.30 seconds to win the 50-meter butterfly, breaking the old 
world record of 23.35 set by Russian Denis Pankratov. Moravcova won 
the 100 individual medley in 1:00.43, topping the old record of 1:00.60 
by China's Xiaowen Hu Chn. The other mark went to the Dutch men, clocking 
a world-best of 1:26.99 in the 4x50. On Friday, Germans Mark Warnecke 
and Thomas Rupprath set world records. Warnecke won gold in a record 
time of 26.70 seconds in the 50-meter breaststroke, and Rupprath clocked 
24.13 in winning the 50-meter backstroke. The German womens' 4x50 
freestyle relay also set a world-best of 1:39.56.
