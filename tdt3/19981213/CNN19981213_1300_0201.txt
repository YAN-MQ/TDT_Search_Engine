Yesterday, the house Judiciary committee finished its work by passing 
the final article amid some contentious debate. Candy Crowley reports. 
Abuse 6 power, the weakest passed through a Judiciary committee increasingly 
susceptible to mood swings. Alternately gracious. This committee unanimously 
prays our chairman, Henry Hyde, at the conclusion of this debate. 
Then angry. This does sometimes to some people begin to take on the 
appearance of a Coup. They can share a laugh. Specificity. Anyway 
-- -- I won't avail myself of that great temptation. But are deeply 
saddened. I've had not said my gut -- knots in my gut all week. I 
approach this with a heavy heart. Mostly they are divided looking 
to derail this train. I have a deep disdain for the president's actions. 
He deserves the admonishment and censure and rebuke of the Congress. 
Republicans scoffed at the idea as meaningless. We've heard about 
healing, closure, the healing process. Next I expect we'll hear we're 
in group therapy. Everyone knew it would fail in committee and democrats 
were already appealing to a higher power to put censure on the house 
floor anyway. I would plead with Mr. Livingston, do not force the 
house on Thursday between two unbalance latable options. Committee 
members lobbied undecided colleagues over the meaning of impeachment. 
Democrats argued it's the nuclear bomb of politics. I would simply 
say, Mr. chairman, tomorrow's headlines should say the truth. We are 
voting to remove the president. Republicans tried to soften the sense 
of fi national, arguing the house accuses. The Senate judges. That's 
the constitutional requirement and that's what we're doing. In no 
way do we diminish or demean the significance, the weightiness of 
what we're doing. Mostly the day was notable for the wear and tear 
on a committee grown weary of fightin' preordaned battles. See you 
in the next Congress. Next step, the house floor. Out come unpredictable. 
The president can hope for the best and win the right to stay in office. 
For Bill Clinton, next week is a lose/lose. Candy Crowley, CNN, Capitol 
Hill.
