Astronauts aboard the space shuttle "endeavour" are scheduled to release 
the international space station this afternoon. The two have been 
joined while the crew carries out some important work. Miles O'Brien 
has details. Space station builders Jerry Ross and Jim Newman were 
looking ahead and laying some "high above the ground" work for future 
orbiting hard hats. They spent most of their third stint in space 
doing prep work at the world's most remote construction site. Houston, 
what's in the refrigerator? Nothing edible. First off in the 6 1/2-hour 
space walk -- placing a tool bag on the outside of the U.S. connecting 
piece, unity. Stand by and let me get a grip. Let me get a real good 
grip on it. They also spent some time pulling cables, clearing away 
those used solely for getting the two pieces of the space station 
coupled together and checking the tension on those that will remain. 
And they perched on top of zarya to place handrails there to help 
future space workers. I don't think it's gonna go anywhere, because 
we've already got 'em tied down pretty tight on those things. We can't 
afford it, so -- I know. In a reprise of their second space walk, 
Ross used a ten-foot boat hook to pry loose a stuck docking antenna 
on zarya. An identical antenna was dislodged the last time they were 
out. You want a couple more taps on this side first? Sure, that'd 
be fine. There it goes. It will freely flow. It was a picture-perfect 
space walk with a picture-taking conclusion. The pair carefully photographed 
the exterior of the space station to help engineers make plans and 
solve future problems. This is weird. You don't do this every day. 
Unfortunately. Clearly savoring the moment, Jerry Ross took in the 
view and offered some thanks to his daughter for making him some glove 
liners. I gotta tell my daughter these gloves are really great. Before 
they returned to the relatively safe confines of "Endeavour," Ross 
and Newman tested a small emergency jet pack, which station builders 
will be carrying in case they break free of their tethers. That's 
an important issue for space walkers in the station era. Should an 
astronaut free fall away from a shuttle, the Orbiter is nimble enough 
to maneuver in for a speedy rescue. A million-pound space station 
won't have that capability. Miles O'Brien, CNN, Johnson space center.
