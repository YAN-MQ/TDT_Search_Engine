a simple majority on the house side would send the impeachment question 
to the senate. nbc's joe johns is following events from capitol hill. 
the top republican vote counter in the house appearing on "meet the 
press" suggested momentum continues to build toward the impeachment 
of the president. some of the republicans that have publicly said 
early that they were going to vote against impeachment have already 
said that they're going to look at it again. the house judiciary committee 
approved four articles of impeachment, one for committing perjury. 
the second for committing perjury in a civil case. the third for obstruction 
of justice. the last, for abuse of power. undecided members are struggling 
to decide how to vote. a number of my colleagues are trying to balance 
concern and a commitment to the rule of law, also with understanding 
this in kind of the real world, what it means to the country if we 
move forward. he will not have been removed. he will still be president 
of the united states until and unless the senate decides to hold a 
trial and convict him of those charges and remove him from office. 
the talk about a censure option for the president continued. house 
judiciary committee chairman henry hyde, outgoing speaker newt gingrich 
and bob livingston have all agreed that censure is not an option. 
supporters of the idea have been discussing procedural maneuvers to 
bypass the leadership on a concept that remains unpopular among the 
republican rank and file. this idea of censure is a political copout, 
in my opinion. some people think it's deserved. i do not believe that 
we have that option given what the president has done. one option 
that has been ruled out by the president is resignation. that did 
not stop chairman henry hyde from embracing it today. i think the 
president should step down. i think he could really be heroic if he 
did that. with no easy way out, supporters and opponents of placing 
their hopes on a dwindling number of undecided members of the house. 
with only a few days to go, the vote is too close to call. joe johns, 
nbc news, the capitol.
