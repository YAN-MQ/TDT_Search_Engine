The Los Angeles film critics association has announced its picks for 
the best of the movie industry in 1998. The Steven Spielberg war epic 
"saving private Ryan" took the best picture award. It also won for 
best director and cinematographer. Two women tied for best actress 
-- Ally Sheedy, for her role as a lesbian drug addict in "higher art," 
and Fernanda Montenegro, who played an elderly woman in "central station." 
The best actor award went to Ian McKellen for his role in "gods and 
monsters."
