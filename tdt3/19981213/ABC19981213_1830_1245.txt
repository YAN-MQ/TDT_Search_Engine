For the second time in five years, the people of Puerto Rico today 
voted on the issue of statehood. The island was annexed by the United 
States a century ago and is now a U.S. commonwealth. But today's vote 
could lead to a change of status. ABC's Steve Osunsami is in San Juan. 
The vote brought the entire island of Puerto Rico to a Standstill. 
Businesses shut down and until the polls closed, no liquor was served 
or sold. Governor Pedro rossello cast his ballot in a San Juan elementary 
school. He hopes Puerto Rico becomes the 51st state, which he feels 
would bring prosperity to nearly four million Puerto Ricans, half 
of whom live in poverty. Every time that a territory has become a 
state, in every occasion, the economy has improved. In this election, 
the ballot included five choices. The two leading voices were statehood 
and remaining a commonwealth of the United States. Supporters of the 
status quo are led by San Juan mayor, sila calderon. We cherish and 
respect the United States. We want to be united to the United States, 
but we want to remain Puerto ricans. The decision has deeply divided 
the island, with some people arguing Puerto Rico should become a separate 
nation. Most Puerto Ricans would like to be independent, but fear 
has been instilled into them. That fear is over economics. The island 
is already dependent on the U.S. and statehood promises at least eight 
new voices in Congress. The question today was whether the money that 
representation could bring is worth possibly losing Spanish language 
and culture. Puerto Rico's status will ultimately be decided by Congress 
and the president. But no one here is sure how much influence today's 
vote will have. Steve Osunsami, ABC News, San Juan, Puerto Rico.
