They are not the kinds of articles you would expect in a high school 
newspaper. But in the Alabama towns of Notasulga (population 925), 
Gaylesville (149) and Oakman (836), articles on murder, sex offenders 
and community politics are as likely to appear in the student journals 
as pictures of the homecoming queen. The schools in all of these towns 
_ as well as in 18 others in the state _ are members of Pacers, a 
cooperative organized by the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa to 
nurture rural schools and the communities they serve. And in a state 
where small towns have been hit hard by urbanization and school consolidation, 
and where hundreds of local newspapers have gone out of business in 
the last few decades, some high school papers have become the only 
means, short of gossip, for communicating local news. ``These schools 
are the linchpins of their communities,'' said Jim Wrye, program manager 
for Pacers, which is short for Program for the Academic and Cultural 
Enhancement of Rural Schools. ``And these newspapers get people in 
the loop.'' Students working on the papers receive a brief period 
of training at the university, Wrye said. The training is largely 
paid for by a grant from the Lyndhurst Foundation, a broad-based charitable 
organization in Chattanooga, Tenn. But the operations of the school 
papers are expected to be self-sustaining. ``The kids do everything,'' 
Wrye said, ``writing stories, selling ads, managing the business.'' 
Many of the school newspapers, which are published monthly, have resurrected 
the nameplates of the commercial papers _ The Oakman Times and The 
Gaylesville Enterprise, for example _ that are now defunct but used 
to serve their communities. People take comfort in the continuity, 
Wrye said. Brenda Boman, an English teacher, is faculty adviser to 
The Notasulga Times, which is published by a high school staff of 
16 at the 620-student Notasulga School. The paper and the school, 
which is attended by kindergartners through 12th graders, serve the 
23,000 residents of Macon County. The closest daily newspaper, The 
Opelika-Auburn News, is aimed at communities 15 to 20 miles away in 
Lee County. ``The student paper is terribly important to the community,'' 
where most employment is in clerical, factory or farm work, Ms. Boman 
said. ``No one else covers us.'' She said that The Notasulga Times 
received no money from the school, but carried enough local ads to 
break even on its annual budget of about $6,000. Students at the school 
papers often go on to study journalism at the university, and serve 
as mentors to the papers they left, Wrye said. He hopes to get every 
rural school in Alabama to join Pacers in the next few years, and 
plans similar programs in North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia.
