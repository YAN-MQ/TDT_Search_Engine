In Florida, many flags are flying at half-staff today, following the 
unexpected death of the state's democratic governor, Lawton Chiles. 
Chiles, who was elected in 1990, apparently died of a heart attack 
yesterday. President Clinton issued a statement from Israel saying 
he was deeply saddened by Chiles' death. Mr. Clinton called the 68-year-old, 
"one of the most respected public officials of the latter half of 
the 20th century." Florida's newly-elected governor also remembered 
Chiles fondly. I was shocked to hear of the passing away of governor 
Chiles. He was a true Florida statesman. He served, for nearly 40 
years, this state. He did it with distinction, honor, integrity. And 
while I may have had a few disagreements with him, I enormously respected 
his leadership abilities and his commitment to children. So I am saddened 
by his loss today, and I send my regards and my respect to his family, 
and I will be praying for them. Florida's lieutenant governor, buddy 
MacKay, has been sworn in as governor and will complete the remaining 
three weeks of Chiles' term.
