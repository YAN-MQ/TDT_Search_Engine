The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 14: A court-appointed 
panel of experts has concluded that existing scientific evidence does 
not show a link between silicone breast implants and systemic disease. 
U.S. Judge Sam Pointer Jr., who is overseeing breast-implant lawsuits 
in the federal courts, convened the panel to advise him on medical 
evidence surrounding implants. His approach was unusual in that he 
sought expert testimony independent of either side in the litigation. 
That strategy may also be useful in other complex cases where juries 
and judges are forced to choose between battling experts who may be 
biased. Lawyers from both sides will now have the opportunity to question 
the expert panelists in depositions and to use that testimony in implant 
trials. The findings should make trials somewhat easier to conduct, 
and may cause more plaintiffs to settle their claims against the implant 
manufacturers. Well before the panel's report, thousands of cases 
had been settled. Last month, Dow Corning Corp., once the leading 
maker of silicone implants, and representatives of implant plaintiffs 
formally agreed to a plan that will pay some 170,000 claimants $3.2 
billion over 15 years for suffering and the costs of implant removal. 
Both sides decided that it was better financially to make a deal than 
to fight out the science in court. The new report, which will not 
affect that settlement, puts forward solid conclusions based on multiple 
studies. But the panel's findings do not represent the last word on 
implant safety. A National Cancer Institute study of 13,500 women 
who have had implants is looking at the long-term health impacts. 
Results from that study will not be available until next year. A panel 
convened by the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy 
of Sciences, is also continuing to review the medical evidence. The 
report from Pointer's panel shows how much is known. Other scientists 
are still researching aspects of implants that are not yet known.
