Hanukkah begins at sundown tonight. The lighting of the menorah is 
the major rich wall commemorating the liberation of Jerusalem and 
its temple from the greeks. The most frequent translation of hanukkah 
is dedication. For the rededication of the temple. Each night one 
light is lit on the menorah until all eight are illuminated.
