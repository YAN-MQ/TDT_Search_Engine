Craig Call Black, a retired museum administrator who was an authority 
on ancient life forms, died on Dec. 5 at Presbyterian Hospital in 
Albuquerque, N.M. He was 66 and lived in Albuquerque. The cause was 
complications from lymphoma, his family said. Black conducted vertebrate 
paleontology research in France, Greece, Tunisia, Algeria and South 
Africa, as well as in Kenya, where he collaborated with the anthropologist 
Richard Leakey. Black was born in Beijing, where his father was teaching 
pediatrics. He received a bachelor's degree in 1954 and a master's 
degree in 1957 from Amherst College, and a doctorate in biology in 
1962 from Harvard University. He began his museum career in 1960 as 
an assistant curator at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 
Pittsburgh. He was appointed curator of vertebrate paleontology in 
1962 and later was director of the Carnegie Museum for seven years. 
From 1982 to 1994, Black was the director of the Natural History Museum 
of Los Angeles County. He was appointed by President Reagan to the 
National Museum Services Board in 1982 and then to the National Science 
Board, which made him chairman of its committees on international 
science programs, global environment and biodiversity. In 1991, President 
Bush named Black to the Environment for the Americas Board. He was 
also a past president of the American Association of Museums. Black 
is survived by his wife of 12 years, Mary Elizabeth King, an anthropologist; 
a daughter, Lorna B. Walsh of Albuquerque; a son, Christopher A., 
of Portland, Ore., and two grandchildren. He is also survived by a 
former wife, Constance Hockenberry Black, of Pittsburgh.
