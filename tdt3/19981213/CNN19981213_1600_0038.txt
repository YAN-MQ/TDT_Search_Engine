Republicans are calling for President Clinton's resignation as the 
full house prepares to vote on articles impeachment. House majority 
whip Tom delay says Mr. Clinton should "put the American people ahead 
of his own ambition," and step down. The president, meanwhile, says 
he has no intention of resigning. Speaking from the Middle East, Mr. 
Clinton says the thought of quitting never crossed his mind. However, 
republicans say resignation is the only honorable thing for Mr. clinton 
to do. I think the president should step down. I think he could really 
be heroic if he did that. He would be the savior of his party. He 
would be welcomed around the country at groups who would love to hear 
him speak. It would be a way of going out with honor.
