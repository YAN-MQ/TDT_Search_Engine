The president of the West Indies Cricket Board and three other people 
with him have been car jacked at gunpoint in the Soweto township near 
Johannesburg, South Africa. Pat Russo, his wife, a journalist, and 
a local cricket official were held up by three armed men on Wednesday. 
They were returning to their car after visiting the Soweto Cricket 
Oval. The attackers forced the group to lie on the ground and took 
their money and jewelry. The robbers then stole the car Russo had 
been driving, but no one was injured in the midday incident. The West 
Indians are on their first official tour of South Africa and begin 
a five-series test on Thursday at the Wanderers Ground in Johannesburg. 
Police are investigating the robbery.
