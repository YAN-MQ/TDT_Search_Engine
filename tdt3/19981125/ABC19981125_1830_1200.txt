So let's go down half a generation. Most of the teenagers we know 
are not out there shopping for, or hoping to be given toys for Christmas. 
But if they were, we think even they might be shocked. Sticker shock 
that is. Here is ABC's Erin Hayes. It has started already -- the searching. 
I was here for zelda. Zelda's not coming in until this afternoon. 
The spending -- We spend too much. Too much. Parents lining up under 
pressure to nab that just-right toy for christmas. Furby. Furbys, 
also. Oh, um, furby. Furby is typical of toys in demand this year, 
called interactive. For $34.99, it's the best A.I., artificial intelligence, 
that you've got. One of the reasons toys are more expensive is many 
are loaded with computer chips that give them huge vocabularies they 
can respond to touch, to light. Don't stop now. Much more sophisticated 
than toys were just a few years ago. Some can now link directly to 
the Internet. Fancy, expensive and for as young as 3 years old, You 
are my special friend. Interactive Internet Barney is more than $100. 
Video games have better graphics and high price tags, up to $200 for 
everything. High expectations this year, even among low-tech toys. 
Some Barbie dolls, are going for almost $300. And for your toddler, 
you can buy a little Mercedes-Benz, for more than $100. Parents tend 
to want to get what their children are screaming loudest for, and 
there's no question that more expensive toys tend to be higher on 
their lists lately. Many parents are encountering wish list sticker 
shock. We've done half of our shopping so far. And we've already gone 
over what we did last year. Well, you have to spend a lot of money 
to get anything now. Not necessarily. There are still plenty of toys 
out there. Lightly priced and loved by kids. One of the most popular 
this year is about 12 bucks, the yo-yo. They're going crazy over the 
yo-yo. It's like a recycling of trends. And they love it. Still, the 
toy industry, which experienced a slump most of this year, is pushing 
hard to move the big items. Kids are responding -- I want 'dat one. 
But parents are advised to take a deep breath. Maybe next time. Okay. 
And remember -- the point is to enjoy the holidays. Erin Hayes, ABC 
News, Atlanta.
