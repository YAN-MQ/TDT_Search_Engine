British sports minister Tony Banks has announced that he wants London 
to submit a bid to be the host city for the Olympic Games in 2012. 
Speaking to delegates at the Annual National Conference for Sport 
and Physical Recreation Wednesday, Banks said he considers hosting 
the Olympics to be more significant than the World Cup. The British 
sports minister made that announcement one day after meeting with 
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, 
but Banks said the IOC will only look at Britain's bid seriously if 
London is the host city. If the British Olympic Association decides 
to submit the bid or the 2012 Olympics, it will face strong competition 
from the United States. Eight American cities have already expressed 
interest in bidding for the games.
