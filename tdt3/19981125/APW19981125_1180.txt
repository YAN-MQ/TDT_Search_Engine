Joe DiMaggio got good news for his 84th birthday on Wednesday. He's 
improving steadily after lung cancer surgery and could be removed 
from intensive care by the end of the day. ``The prognosis for his 
recovery is good,'' said Dr. Earl Barron, the lead doctor on a team 
of six physicians who have been treating the Hall of Fame outfielder 
in Florida. Barron, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press 
today, for the first time confirmed DiMaggio had a cancerous tumor 
removed from his right lung. He said the surgery was done two days 
after DiMaggio entered the hospital Oct. 12, and that the New York 
Yankees great had suffered severe post operative complications, including 
a serious lung infection. ``For a while, it was touch and go, but 
he has been showing steady improvement and he possibly could be out 
of intensive care today,'' Barron said. Because of his age, DiMaggio's 
progress is ``guarded,'' Barron said, but he added that the former 
centerfielder's condition is very good, compared to what it had been. 
DiMaggio began his birthday celebration at 6 a.m. with a group of 
well-wishers crowded into his room at Memorial Regional Hospital in 
Hollywood, Florida. Among them were his brother Dom, also a former 
major league outfielder; Dom's wife, Emily; DiMaggio's granddaughter 
Paula and her husband, Jim; his lawyer and longtime friend, Morris 
Engelberg; Barron; and a couple of nurses. Barron said DiMaggio still 
was on a respirator, but the setting was 50 percent of what it had 
been at the height of the crisis, and he could be weaned from it by 
the end of the week. The main problem was a buildup of fluid in DiMaggio's 
lungs as the result of the infection, and at one point, an opening 
was made in his trachea to help his breathing. Barron said DiMaggio 
had never had a heart attack, contrary to television reports earlier 
this week. ``It was a tremendous drop in blood pressure, and it scared 
the life out of me,'' said Engelberg, who has been acting as DiMaggio's 
spokesman. Engelberg said he became so concerned by the DiMaggio's 
critical turn on Nov. 16 that a Roman Catholic priest was summoned 
to give last rites. ``But I came in the next morning and there he 
was, shaving himself,'' said Engelberg. ``He's amazing.'' DiMaggio, 
who retired in 1951 after 13 seasons with the Yankees, had been a 
smoker, starting in his youth in San Francisco. Engelberg said DiMaggio 
had instructed him not to divulge any medical information about his 
condition, but because of recent erroneous TV reports, DiMaggio agreed 
to allow Barron to speak with the AP. ``Joe was angry when he saw 
on television that he had had a heart attack,'' Engelberg said. ``I 
asked Dr. Barron, `Did Joe have a heart attack?' and Barron told Joe, 
`No, you didn't have a heart attack.''' DiMaggio has a private room 
in the the children's hospital wing named for him. Security is tight, 
and only people visiting patients were allowed in the area. There 
were no signs anywhere in the hospital that it was his birthday.
