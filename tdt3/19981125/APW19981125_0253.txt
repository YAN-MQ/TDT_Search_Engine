Ukraine may break a moratorium on capital punishment and execute a 
man accused of 52 killings if he is found guilty, news reports said 
Wednesday. Anatoliy Onoprienko, 39, whose trial began on Monday in 
the regional court of Zhytomyr, has admitted to the killings, which 
took place in 1989 and in 1995-96, according to his attorney. Onoprienko 
is likely to get a death sentence if convicted, officials have said. 
Ukraine imposed a moratorium on death penalties last year, but President 
Leonid Kuchma said he was ready to appeal to the Council of Europe 
regarding the possible execution of Onoprienko if he's convicted, 
Ukraine's One Plus One TV channel and the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
Ukraine agreed to halt capital punishment in 1995 when it joined the 
Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights organization. 
However, 180 convicted criminals were executed before the former Soviet 
republic introduced a moratorium on death penalties in March 1997, 
replacing executions with life imprisonment. Amnesty International, 
the London-based human rights group, said Ukraine was second only 
to China in the use of capital punishment in 1996. Last September, 
Ukraine's legislature gave preliminary approval to a new criminal 
code that permits use of the death penalty only during periods of 
martial law. Still, courts have sentenced more than 80 people to death 
so far this year, though no executions have been carried out. The 
40-nation Council of Europe, which promotes democracy, human rights 
and the rule of law, forbids members from executing criminals. The 
Council's Parliamentary Assembly has threatened to suspend Ukraine's 
membership this year unless it outlawed capital punishment, but the 
threat was dropped after Ukraine pledged not to carry out executions. 
A Ukrainian parliamentary delegation left for The Hague on Wednesday 
to take part in a session of the assembly's monitoring commission. 
A delegation member, Vasyl Kostytsky, said the commission was preparing 
a resolution that was ``very threatening'' for Ukraine. Kostytsky 
said the council was ``not willing to understand the situation with 
the death penalty in Ukraine,'' the Interfax news agency reported. 
``As soon as there was a discussion of a moratorium on death penalty,'' 
an upsurge in mass murders hit Ukraine, Kostytsky said in an apparent 
reference to Onoprienko.
