The man hired to write Monica Lewinsky's side of the presidential 
scandal has become famous here in the last few weeks, maybe even more 
famous than she is. And from what Kenyans have seen, this much is 
clear: If she is looking for a sympathetic ear, she probably picked 
the right man. Sandwiched between his account of the crumbling marriage 
of Diana, the Princess of Wales, and the Lewinsky book, British journalist 
Andrew Morton spent three years writing about another public figure: 
Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, the president of Kenya since 1978. The 
book about Moi, a mysterious figure to many people here, was published 
this month. In the first few days it sold some 7,000 copies here, 
faster than any book before, as Kenyans rushed to read one of the 
only in-depth works about their president. But sales are slacking 
off, and some Kenyans are growing angry at what they say is Morton's 
relentlessly sunny story, from Moi's boyhood in the rural Rift Valley 
to his rise to power to the still-unsolved murder in 1991 of one of 
his top aides. The biography is so positive and apologetic that many 
people in Kenya are confused: either Morton was paid to write the 
book, which his publishers deny, or he was writing about some other 
Moi. ``Perhaps because serving his nation is now second nature, he 
rarely, if ever thinks of himself before his country,'' reads a typical 
sentence in the 305-page book, ``Moi: The Making of an African Statesman,'' 
published by Michael O'Mara Books, the same company that is putting 
out the Lewinsky book. ``It's an odd book,'' said John Githongo, a 
political analyst and columnist for The East African, a weekly newspaper 
that has been running sections of the book this month, and selling 
a lot more papers because of it. ``The character that is created is 
so different from the one most Kenyans believe they know. ``For Monica 
Lewinsky, I think it's quite healthy,'' he added. Despite his two 
decades in office, many Kenyans say their president remains a cipher. 
Critics contend he is an inarticulate throwback: one of the last African 
``Big Men'' who has ruled by opposing multiparty democracy, encouraging 
ethnic divisiveness and, at a minimum, sitting back as corruption 
eroded the economy. There is a more charitable view, which Morton 
embraces on every page: That for all his faults, Moi has been a friend 
to the West who has kept Kenya largely peaceful as neighboring countries 
crumbled into conflict. Many people believe education has improved, 
and Kenyans, and their vibrant press, can mostly say what they please, 
despite regular exceptions. As his rule nears an end _ Moi, 74, must 
step down in 2002 _ he is reportedly worried about embedding the latter 
view into history. Along came Morton, who had earned millions of dollars 
on his books about the British royalty, notably, ``Diana: Her True 
Story,'' written in 1992 with the covert cooperation of the princess. 
There has been much speculation, here and in Britain, about exactly 
why Morton decided to take on the project and why Moi, who has granted 
few interviews in his life, cooperated. A person close to both the 
Moi government and Morton said the president was concerned about his 
legacy and felt Morton would be sympathetic. ``There is a feeling 
at State House that the president doesn't get a fair wind,'' the person 
said. Despite speculation in the press here about exactly how much 
Morton was paid for the book, the person denied that any money changed 
hands. ``He looked me straight in the eye and told me in absolutely 
no way was he paid by State House,'' the person said. Still, the book's 
tone has done little to dampen suspicions. ``One cannot help hoping 
that Morton was well paid for this book,'' read a scathing review 
in The Times of London, ``since it will do his reputation nothing 
but harm.'' Morton, reportedly holed up in Los Angeles with Ms. Lewinsky 
working on her book, could not be reached for comment. But he has 
become a celebrity in his own right here, though much of the attention 
has not been good. Most contentious has been Morton's explanation 
of the murder of Dr. Robert Ouko, the foreign minister who was seen 
as a possible rival to Moi. The death has long hung over Moi's rule, 
and the killing has been linked to several people close to the president. 
Morton singles out one of them, Hezekiah Oyugi, the security chief, 
raising the possibility that Ouko had an affair with one of Oyugi's 
three wives. Oyugi died six years ago, but his family disputes Morton's 
account. One of Kenya's most respected jurists, Justice Richard Otieno 
Kwach, is threatening to sue Morton over an allegation that he and 
two other judges investigating the murder were regularly entertained 
at Oyugi's house. ``He didn't give any of us the opportunity to rebut 
the allegations,'' Kwach said. ``He just swallowed what he was given, 
hook, line and sinker.'' Kwach fumed in an interview, but then broke 
out into unjudicial laughter when the subject of Monica Lewinsky's 
book arose. ``I wasn't surprised,'' he said. ``I don't think he will 
be engaged in anything better.'' A sampling of Kenyans in Nairobi 
said that the book was worth reading no matter what, simply, they 
said, because they know so little about Moi's life. What they thought 
of the book depended largely on what they thought of the man. ``Everyone 
wants to know the personal life of the president _ about why he is 
such a great president and what his secret is being so powerful, great 
and energetic,'' said Jitesh R. Upadhyay, 34, a bookstore owner. But 
few were so upbeat. ``I want to know how he has survived all these 
political upheavals,'' said George Muturia, 26, an anthropology student 
who had just bought the book. ``I'm not very optimistic. But I'm hoping 
to get some clues.''
