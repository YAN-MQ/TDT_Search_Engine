Athletes found guilty of using steroids could face life bans and fines 
of up to dlrs 1 million under new anti-doping proposals put forward 
by the International Olympic Committee. A package of proposed drug 
sanctions, including a precise definition of doping, has been drawn 
up by a special IOC panel and will be presented to leaders of 35 international 
sports federations in Switzerland on Friday. But some top Olympic 
officials say the proposals are too complicated and confuse the issue 
rather than solve it. The IOC wants all federations to endorse a single 
medical code, embracing uniform drug rules, procedures and sanctions, 
in advance of the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping conference in Lausanne. 
An IOC working group dealing with legal and ethical issues has come 
up with a proposed definition of doping as the basis for the fight 
against performance-enhancing drugs. Doping is defined as one or both 
of the following: _ ``use of an expedient substance or method potentially 
harmful to health and capable of enhancing the athlete's performance'' 
_ ``the presence in the athlete's body of a substance or evidence 
of a use of a method where such substance appears'' on the IOC's list 
of banned substances. Gunnar Werner, Swedish secretary of the international 
swimming federation (FINA) and a member of the IOC panel, said the 
proposal divides doping offenses into two categories: ``regular'' 
and ``aggravated'' cases. Werner said aggravated cases were defined 
as ``intentional doping,'' including attempts to mask or manipulate 
urine samples or refusal to take a drug test. The package lists four 
types of penalties: disqualification from an event, a warning, suspension 
and fines. In the so-called regular cases, sanctions for use of stimulants 
such as ephedrine would be punished by suspensions of one to six months. 
For harder drugs, the penalty would range from six months to two years. 
For aggravated cases, the proposal calls for suspensions of two years 
to eight years. If ``intentional doping'' with steroids is proven, 
a life ban is recommended. The proposal calls for fines of up to dlrs 
100,000 for minor drug offenses and fines of up to dlrs 1 million 
for serious infractions. Any third parties, such as doctors or coaches 
involved in supplying drugs to athletes, would also be liable to penalties. 
Existing IOC guidelines are much simpler, recommending a maximum two-year 
suspension for athletes committing a first steroid offense. There 
is no provision for fines. Even though Werner was on the IOC panel 
which drew up the new proposals, he said he thought the measures were 
flawed. ``As a lawyer, I understand the discussions, but it won't 
be so easy to apply it for those non-lawyers,'' he said in a telephone 
interview Wednesday. ``This proposal is complicated, maybe a little 
too complicated.'' He questioned the differentiation between doping 
and ``intentional doping.'' ``How can anybody prove intentions?'' 
he said. ``How many cases of doping are not intentional?'' Werner 
also expressed concern that the proposals put the entire burden of 
proof in doping cases on the sports bodies. The federations would 
have to prove the athletes guilty, rather than the athletes proving 
their innocence. ``Now I can see every athlete saying, `This was not 
my sample, it was not my urine,' or whatever,'' Werner said. ``We 
would have to prove that it is. It's my opinion that in steroids and 
more severe drugs like human growth hormone, the burden of proof should 
be shifted from the federations to the athlete.'' Dick Pound, a Canadian 
member of the IOC executive board, also said the proposals were too 
complicated and missed the key point. ``You've got doping or you don't,'' 
he said. ``If you take a cold medicine, you can have a basis for inadvertent 
doping. But if you are using human growth hormone or steroids, come 
on. I think doping is doping. We should put the onus on the person 
who tested positive to prove his innocence. There is no point nuancing 
all these things.''
