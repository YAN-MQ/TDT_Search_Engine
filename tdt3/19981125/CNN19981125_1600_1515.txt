Environmentalists are trying to bring an end to some activities that 
are taking a toll on the world's Tiger population. Denise Dillon has 
the story. There are only about 5,000 tigers left on the entire planet. 
Environmentalists say they're being wiped out by man. The international 
illegal trade in Tiger parts could well push the Tiger over the edge. 
Although there has been a worldwide ban on the sale of Tiger parts 
since 1987, it hasn't stopped the problem. The environmental investigation 
agency, based in the United Kingdom, says it is especially concerned 
about the Tiger trade in Asia. Japan has consistently failed to bring 
in adequate legislation to eliminate the trade in Tiger parts that 
are not readily recognizable, such as Tiger bone and medicines that 
contain Tiger bone. The eia investigated more than two dozen pharmacies 
in Japan. As this hidden video shows, the pharmacist in this shop 
is selling what he says is a Tiger bone. There are claims the shinbone 
is good for medicinal use. Another store in Tokyo is selling Tiger 
bone wine and other body parts, claiming they're remedies for rheumatism 
and aphrodisiacs. The eia is trying to put a stop to the illegal trade. 
Eia calls upon the Japanese government to take immediate action to 
eliminate all trade in all Tiger parts and calls on the Japanese consumer 
to stop buying these products. If these actions aren't taken soon, 
environmentalists say the illegal trade may soon quiet the roar of 
these animals forever. Denise Dillon, "Headline News."
