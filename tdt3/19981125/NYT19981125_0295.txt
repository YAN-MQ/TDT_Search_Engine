In a gorgeous, eerie moment from the new two-CD recording of Stephen 
Sondheim's score for ``Follies,'' an ancient star named Heidi Schiller 
(Carol Skarimbas) appears like the Ghost of Operetta Past at the emotionally 
fraught reunion of a group of long-retired Broadway showgirls. Lifting 
a ravaged voice that bears traces of the ethereal ingenue she used 
to be, Heidi sings ``One More Kiss,'' a soaring waltz in the style 
of Sigmund Romberg that is so marzipan sweet it almost makes your 
teeth hurt. As Heidi gets lost in the song, her younger self (Ingrid 
Ladendorf) appears on the stage, and the two join voices to express 
sentiments you would never hear in an actual Romberg love song: ``Dreams 
are a sweet mistake/ All dreamers must awake.'' The words ``Never 
look back'' send up a ripple of anxiety before the song makes its 
final pivot around a quintessentially dark Sondheimian reminder: ``All 
things beautiful must die.'' The tug of war between the tune's spiraling 
blissfulness and the lyric's denial of happily-ever-after is what 
``Follies'' is all about. It's also Sondheim at his most fiendishly 
brilliant, lovingly parodying the past while simultaneously rebutting 
its head-in-the-sand homilies. Besides the Ziegfeld Follies (renamed 
in the musical after a fictional producer named Weismann), other follies 
the show relentlessly exposes are the folly of trying to live in a 
rose-colored past, the folly of fantasizing a rose-colored future 
and (as always in Sondheim) the folly of trying to deny death. The 
entire show, like Shakespeare's ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' is a 
visionary flash of recognition that dashes its characters' romantic 
fantasies at the very moment they have been conjured. The story concentrates 
on Phyllis (Dee Hoty) and Sally (Donna McKechnie), two unhappily married 
Weismann girls and their husbands, Ben (Laurence Guittard) and Buddy 
(Tony Roberts), as the couples confront their pasts in a theater that's 
about to be torn down. The climactic sequence is a nightmare version 
of a Ziegfeld-style extravaganza in which the characters' domestic 
crises become grotesquely jolly production numbers. These surreal 
star turns do more than just mock their self-deception. They brutally 
address the inability of the oldtime Broadway musical itself to deal 
with reality. Sondheim's master stroke is in demonstrating through 
musical pastiche how vintage Broadway styles can be retooled to express 
the bitterest of psychological truths. All of this is forcefully dramatized 
on the new ``Follies: The Complete Recording'' (TVT Soundtrax 1030), 
which features the cast of the recent, critically acclaimed production 
at Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. Vocally and dramatically, 
the new recording may not be definitive, but by including every scrap 
of music written for the show, it is complete in a way no other ``Follies'' 
album has been. An original cast album on Capitol has the most dramatically 
focused performances but omits some of the music. The sensational 
1986 ``Follies in Concert'' recording of a Lincoln Center concert 
production (on RCA) generates the most theatrical excitement with 
its incandescent solos by Barbara Cook, Elaine Stritch and others. 
The cast album of the show's 1987 London revival introduces a new 
song, a Cole Porter parody, ``Ah, But Underneath'' that replaced the 
Kurt Weill parody ``The Story of Lucy and Jessie.'' The new ``Follies'' 
includes an appendix of eight numbers that were cut from the show 
during various stages of its life along with some instrumental music 
(all beautifully orchestrated by Sondheim's master collaborator, Jonathan 
Tunick, who also conducts). And in the liner notes, Sondheim himself 
describes the original purpose and placement of each of the dropped 
numbers. Among the cut songs, the one most central to the score (and 
still prominently featured in the overture) is another waltz, ``All 
Things Bright and Beautiful,'' which the composer explains was the 
prelude to a scene in which the former show girls actually put on 
a performance for their husbands and escorts. That scene, which was 
dropped, later evolved into the Walpurgis Night that concludes ``Follies.'' 
In the earlier version, Ben offers a bunch of artificial flowers to 
Sally, the woman he wishes he had married, and the two promise each 
other ``everything forever.'' Musically, the song is a grand Ravel-influenced 
waltz that anticipates the sound and style of Sondheim's ``A Little 
Night Music.'' Two other songs stand out. ``Can That Boy Fox-Trot,'' 
written for Carlotta (Ann Miller), the hard-bitten show business veteran 
who sings ``I'm Still Here,'' matches in hilariously smutty double-entendres 
anything Cole Porter wrote. The youthful love-bird fantasy ``Who Could 
Be Blue?''/``Little White House,'' stands up beautifully beside such 
prototypes as Rodgers and Hart's ``Blue Room'' As for the show's already 
familiar songs, the new recording offers performances that are most 
notable for their dramatic directness. Ms. Hoty's Phyllis smothers 
a volcanic rage under a chic exterior and finds a perfect mixture 
of chilly hauteur and wistful anger in her signature song, ``Could 
I Leave You?'' When Guittard's Ben isn't being pompously grandiose 
(in ``The Road You Didn't Take''), he blusters about in a state of 
spluttering nostalgia. Roberts makes Buddy (in ``The Right Girl'') 
a harried angst-ridden sad sack. Ms. McKechnie brings Sally's self-deluded 
romanticism down to earth in her two big numbers, ``In Buddy's Eyes'' 
and ``Losing My Mind,'' undercutting both songs' melodic elegance 
to express her character's neurotic hysteria. Ann Miller, in charge 
of ``I'm Still Here,'' the show's most famous song, overlooks its 
undertone of savage bitterness and treats it as the friendly greeting 
of a gung-ho party girl. In the same upbeat spirit, Kaye Ballard makes 
Hattie (``Broadway Baby'') a warm-hearted old hoofer. Together, these 
performances make for a ``Follies'' that feels very real. What has 
been sacrificed is a certain grandeur. Twenty-seven years have passed 
since ``Follies'' first opened on Broadway, yet the show remains so 
incredibly fresh it seems almost age-proof. In hindsight, the jolt 
it brought to Broadway is the same sort of reality therapy Bob Dylan 
brought to folk music several years earlier. Just as Dylan insisted 
that folk be broader in its subject matter than songs of solidarity 
sung smugly around a campfire, Sondheim insisted that the Broadway 
musical could (and should) face reality: Boy meets girl; boy loses 
girl; boy gets girl back and they live unhappily ever after. Or until 
they die. Broadway hasn't been the same since.
