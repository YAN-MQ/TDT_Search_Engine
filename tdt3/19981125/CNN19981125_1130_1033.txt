In Alaska, the Exxon valdez trustee council has bought over 40,000 
acres of land which will be set aside for preservation. The land is 
close to the spot where the infamous tanker spilled millions of gallons 
of oil in 1989. The $70.5 million deal was the most expensive land 
acquisition made by the council. The trustees oversee the $900 million 
Exxon has pledged to pay to settle claims against it for the spill. 
In all, the council plans to buy about 650,000 acres of Alaska coastline.
