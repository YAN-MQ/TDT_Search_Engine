Jamaica's highest court on Wednesday stayed the executions of three 
convicted killers pending a hearing on whether the men have exhausted 
all of their appeals. Dalton Daley and Peter Blaine had been scheduled 
to hang on Thursday, and Milton Montague on Tuesday. Jamaica's Supreme 
Court stayed the executions until a Tuesday hearing by a judges' panel. 
The men claimed that their appeals to the Inter-American Human Rights 
Commission, a tribunal organized by the Organization of American States, 
had not been decided yet. They also objected to a six-month limit 
on death-row appeals to international bodies that was recently adopted 
by Jamaica's government. It was unclear what would happen if the commission 
ruled in favor of the convicts. The rights watchdog advises member 
governments, but they are not obliged to act on its recommendations. 
Some Caribbean countries accuse the commission of deliberately delaying 
its decisions to prevent hangings. On Oct. 15, the Bahamas ignored 
a last-minute appeal by the commission and hanged two murder convicts. 
Eager to remove barriers to executions, Jamaica plans to withdraw 
from the human rights agreement that gives prisoners the right to 
appeal to the commission. Like other Caribbean countries, Jamaica 
says the death penalty deters crime linked to drug trafficking in 
the region.
