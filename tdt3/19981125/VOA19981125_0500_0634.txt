A team from the International Monetary Fund has left Moscow, saying 
that Russia can expect no more aid until it improves its tax collections 
and adopts a more realistic budget. Kremlin officials say they'll 
submit a new budget to parliament December 7th in the hopes of gaining 
release of more than $22 billion -- or more of the $22-billion loan 
package the IMF has earmarked for Russia.
