Scientists have turned to Gene therapy to find a solution to baldness. 
Dr. Steve Salvatore reports, they're growing hair on mice, and doing 
the same thing on people could be next. The newest baldness study 
turns conventional wisdom on its head. Researchers at the University 
of Chicago's Howard Hughes medical institute experimented with mice. 
When it comes to skin problems, a lot of what's found in mice applies 
to people. And they found that bald mice can grow new hair follicles. 
We've always been taught that you're born with a fixed number of hair 
follicles and that you can never grow them again in adult life. This 
study would suggest that now we actually have the capability to do 
that. What caused the bald mice to grow hair is a protein called beta 
catenin. Beta catenin has the ability to stimulate the formation of 
new hair follicles, a process that normally takes place in development 
and one which can be induced in adult skin. But there are dangers 
to consider. You can actually go too far and cause the cells to grow 
too much. So we'd want to turn on these genes for a short enough time 
to grow a Follicle, and then turn them back off. And that could cause 
the development of tumors. Scientists say more research is needed. 
We still need to understand how this molecule is regulated inside 
the cell of the developing hair follicle to really take it to the 
level of clinical applications. Many consider baldness to be a man's 
problem, and it's not surprising, with 50% of men over age 50 experiencing 
some kind of male pattern baldness. But there are many different types 
of baldness that can affect women and even children. The researchers 
say their finding may not be able to help everyone. For those people 
who are born bald or very soon become bald, I would say that this 
finding may not be -- have clinical applications. So for now, if you're 
bald, you're going to have to be patient. Dr. Steve Salvatore, CNN,
