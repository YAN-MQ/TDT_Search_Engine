And we are off to the Indian Ocean for today's answer to our Geography 
Quiz. Tomorrow, while we're getting second helpings of stuffing, 86 
women from around the globe will hit the runway at our mystery spot 
to compete for the title of Miss World. This place also happens to 
be the home of Esmeralda, the famous 150-year-old turtle who, as it 
turns out, is actually a he not a she. So it looks as if not all the 
attractions in this place are two legged and female. Esmeralda's home 
and our answer is the Sea Shells. This is PRI, Public Radio International.
