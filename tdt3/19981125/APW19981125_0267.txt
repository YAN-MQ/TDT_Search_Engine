A suspected drug dealer hit a policeman on the head with a pipe and 
escaped during a re-enactment of his alleged crime being staged as 
part of investigations, an officer said Wednesday. The suspect, Thawatchai 
Pongsawang, will face additional charges of assaulting a police officer, 
resisting arrest and escaping detention, said the officer, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. Lt. Pitipan Krissadakorn na Ayutthaya, 
the policeman who was hit Monday during the re-enactment, has 90 days 
to catch Thawatchai or face disciplinary action for negligence, the 
officer added. The officer could not answer why there was only one 
policeman on duty during the re-enactment. Thai police long have used 
re-enactments as part of their standard procedure for investigating 
criminal cases. In highly publicized cases, such as rape or murder, 
a large crowd often gathers to witness the re-enactment, and on occasion 
angry onlookers try to attack the suspects.
