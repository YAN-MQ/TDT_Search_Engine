The world governing body of track and field on Wednesday ratified 
Kenyan Tegla Loroupe's one-hour record set Aug. 7 in Borgholzhausen, 
Germany. Loroupe, who also holds the world record for the marathon, 
covered 18,340 meters (11.396 miles) in an hour to beat the old mark 
of 18,084 meters (11.237 miles) set in 1981 by Italy's Silvana Cruciata. 
The Kenyan set the world marathon record in April in Rotterdam, clocking 
2 hours 20 minutes 47 seconds for 26.2 miles (42.2 kilometers). On 
Sunday, the Kenyan woman was given the IAAF's ``Outstanding Performance 
Award'' for the marathon record.
