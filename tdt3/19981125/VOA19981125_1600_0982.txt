Prosecutors in the U.S. State of Michigan have decided to press first-degree 
murder and other charges against assisted suicide advocate Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian. The CBS television network aired a videotape Sunday showing 
Dr. Kevorkian injecting lethal chemicals into the body of a terminally 
ill man, Thomas Youk. The prosecutor for Oakland County, Michigan, 
said he will not turn his back on an obvious violation of the law. 
Dr. Kevorkian has admitted helping some 130 terminally ill people 
commit suicide.
