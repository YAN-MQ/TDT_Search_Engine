Congolese rebels on Wednesday acknowledged for the first time that 
Zimbabwean warplanes bombed the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika in 
an apparent escalation of the government's counteroffensive. Congolese 
state radio said on Tuesday the government and its allies had hit 
an aircraft in Kalemie, a port 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of 
the rebel stronghold at Goma. The air raid followed a similar attack 
last week in which the government claimed to have sunk six barges 
carrying 600 rebel troops between Kalemie and Moba, the southernmost 
town under rebel control. The rebels denied the report. ``There was 
bombing of Kalemie. But I don't know what the target was,'' rebel 
leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said from the northern city of Kisangani. 
``As far as I know, nothing happened and there were no casualties.'' 
``If they are using more precise aircraft, there is a ground for us 
to be extra worried,'' Wamba said. ``We are waiting for them. We are 
not going let them overrun us.'' In the past, rebel military commanders 
have dismissed the threat of Zimbabwean air force, saying its planes 
were dropping bombs from too high an attitude to hit precise targets. 
They said the Zimbabweans were not flying low for fear of being hit 
by surface-to-air missiles. The rebels have no air strike capacity. 
Analysts blame rainy season, muddy roads and low clouds for hampering 
air attacks and a lull in fighting in Congo, where the rebels have 
overtaken the eastern half of the country since Aug. 2. They claim 
to be pushing toward the diamond city of Mbuji-Mayi, copper-rich southern 
Katanga Province, and Equatoria in northern Congo. The rebels are 
backed in arms and weapons by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, who accuse 
President Laurent Kabila of failing to rid the common border of the 
insurgents fighting their governments. So far, the government _ backed 
by troops, tanks and planes from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad 
_ have had little success in halting rebel advances. Last week, Zimbabwe 
sent 1,500 military police to eastern Congo, apparently to restore 
discipline and cut desertion among its 8,000 troops. Also, Wamba dismissed 
as ``imprecise'' accusations by the Amnesty International that the 
rebels were responsible for killings, rape and disappearances of civilians 
in eastern Congo. He said his Congolese Democratic Coalition had previously 
admitted to killing several hundred people sheltering in a southern 
church August, the most serious accusation brought by the human rights 
group. ``We have nothing to hide. We recognize there was a massacre. 
We are conducting an inquiry. We have not come up with a conclusion 
yet,'' he said. Amnesty accused Kabila's forces of a string of anti-Tutsi 
killings in Katanga and the capital, Kinshasa.
