President Franjo Tudjman called on the opposition for the first time 
Wednesday to cooperate with his ruling party in dealing with both 
domestic politics and foreign policy. Tudjman's remarks represent 
an acknowledgement that his Croatian Democratic Union, whose rule 
has been unchallenged since Croatia proclaimed independence from former 
Yugoslavia in 1991, is rapidly losing popularity ahead of upcoming 
parliamentary elections. The elections are scheduled for late 1999 
but may be called as early March. The Croatian leader made his comments 
in a speech at Zagreb airport after returning from an official visit 
to Greece. Increasingly opposed at home for his virtual one-man rule, 
he evidently is hoping to improve his party's image by ceding some 
influence. The six-party opposition coalition, which has overcome 
past divisions and held together for months, poses a new threat to 
his party. He also may have acted under pressure from Western governments, 
which have long been pushing him to strengthen Croatia's fledgling 
democracy and loosen his grip on power. Tudjman said his party ``offers 
cooperation to all constructive political forces in solving current 
internal problems and even in finding common attitude in the country's 
foreign affairs.'' Croatia has recently been rocked by a series of 
political scandals. Three close aides to Tudjman resigned, and one 
accused another Tudjman associate of using military counter-intelligence 
in a media campaign against his opponents. A parliamentary commission 
rejected these claims, but opposition deputies accused Tudjman's party 
of a coverup. Vladimir Seks, a senior member of Tudjman's party, said 
late Tuesday his party was negotiating cooperation with the opposition, 
possibly even including a reopening of the intelligence service investigation. 
There was no immediate reaction from the opposition.
