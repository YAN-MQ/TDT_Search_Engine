Many of our local FM and medium-wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Today is Wednesday, November 
25th, 1998. Thirty-five years ago today in 1963, the people of the 
United States paused in grief for the burial of President John F. 
Kennedy. The youngest elected president of the United States had been 
assassinated by a sniper in Dallas, Texas, three days earlier. Following 
somber ceremonies at the Capitol, the White House, and a Roman Catholic 
Cathedral, the coffin containing Mr. Kennedy's body was taken by horse-drawn 
wagon to Arlington National Cemetery for burial. An aging Cardenal 
Cushing of Boston, a longtime Kennedy family friend, opened the graveside 
service as darkness began to descend. In a final salute to the young 
president, Air Force One, the presidential aircraft, flew low over 
the scene, and a bugler played the traditional "Call of Taps." Following 
the burial ceremony, President Kennedy's widow lit an eternal flame 
at the grave site. We have more ways than ever for you to listen to
