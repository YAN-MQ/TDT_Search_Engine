For the second month in a row, Americans have spent more than they 
have earned. Personal income rose 0.4% last month, while consumer 
spending shot up 0.5%. it's a promising sign for holiday sales. The 
real estate market is warming up. The national association of realtors 
reports sales of existing homes increased by 2.1% last month. The 
increase was fueled by low mortgage rates. And the number of Americans 
filing for jobless benefits for the first time fell a surprisingly 
steep 39,000 last week, to 300,000.
