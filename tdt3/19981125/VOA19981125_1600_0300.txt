Prosecutors in the U.S. state of Michigan have decided to press first-degree 
murder and other charges against assisted suicide advocate Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian. The CBS television network aired a videotape Sunday showing 
Dr. Kevorkian injecting lethal chemicals into the body of a terminally 
ill man. David Gorcyca is the prosecutor of Oakland County, Michigan. 
We have today issued a three-count felony warrant against Mr. Kevorkian: 
count one for first-degree premeditated murder, count two for criminal 
assistance in a -- to a suicide, and count three, delivery of a controlled 
substance. Dr. Kevorkian has acknowledged helping some 130 terminally 
ill people commit suicide. I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News.
