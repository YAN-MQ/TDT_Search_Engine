Congolese rebels on Wednesday acknowledged for the first time that 
Zimbabwean warplanes bombed the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika in 
an apparent escalation of the government's counteroffensive. Congolese 
state radio said on Tuesday the government and its allies hit an aircraft 
in Kalemie, a port 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of the rebel stronghold 
at Goma. In a statement in the capital Harare, Zimbabwean government 
said the operation marked the beginning of an allied offensive against 
invading Rwandan and Ugandan troops. ``The offensive is part of the 
overall objective to rid Congo of foreign troops illegally occupying 
the country and thereby restoring the territorial integrity of (Congo),'' 
it said. The air raid followed a similar attack last week in which 
the government claimed to have sunk six barges carrying 600 rebel 
troops between Kalemie and Moba, the southernmost town under rebel 
control. The rebels denied the report. ``There was bombing of Kalemie. 
But I don't know what the target was,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba 
dia Wamba said from the northern city of Kisangani. ``As far as I 
know, nothing happened and there were no casualties.'' ``If they are 
using more precise aircraft, there is a ground for us to be extra 
worried,'' Wamba said. ``We are waiting for them. We are not going 
let them overrun us.'' In Kigali, a senior Rwandan official, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, confirmed Zimbabwean planes had dropped 
bombs over Kalemie at the weekend but caused no casualties. He said 
the air raids would have little impact on the situation on the ground, 
which he said favored the Rwandan-backed rebels. In the past, rebel 
military commanders have dismissed the threat of Zimbabwean air force, 
saying its planes were dropping bombs from too high an attitude to 
hit precise targets. They said the Zimbabweans were not flying low 
for fear of being hit by surface-to-air missiles. The rebels have 
no air strike capacity. Analysts blame the rainy season, muddy roads 
and low clouds for hampering air attacks and a lull in fighting in 
Congo, where the rebels have overtaken the eastern half of the country 
since Aug. 2. They claim to be pushing toward the diamond city of 
Mbuji-Mayi, copper-rich southern Katanga Province, and Equatoria in 
northern Congo. The rebels are backed by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, 
which accuse President Laurent Kabila of failing to rid the common 
border of the insurgents fighting their governments. So far, the government 
_ backed by troops, tanks and planes from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia 
and Chad _ have had little success in halting rebel advances. Last 
week, Zimbabwe sent 1,500 military police to eastern Congo, apparently 
to restore discipline and cut desertion among its 8,000 troops. Also, 
Wamba dismissed as ``imprecise'' accusations by the Amnesty International 
that the rebels were responsible for killings, rape and disappearances 
of civilians in eastern Congo. He said his Congolese Democratic Coalition 
had previously admitted to killing several hundred people sheltering 
in a southern church August, the most serious accusation brought by 
the human rights group. ``We have nothing to hide. We recognize there 
was a massacre. We are conducting an inquiry. We have not come up 
with a conclusion yet,'' he said. Amnesty accused Kabila's forces 
of a string of anti-Tutsi killings in Katanga and the capital, Kinshasa.
