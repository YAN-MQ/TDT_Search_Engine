Pete Sampras of the United States moved one step closer to finishing 
the year as the men's top-ranked tennis player in the world for a 
record sixth consecutive time. Sampras won his opening round match 
at the ATP world championships in Hanover, Germany, with a straight 
set 6-2, 6-4 victory over eighth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia. 
Sampras said it's important to score a convincing win early on in 
a tournament. There's nothing I did differently today versus, I mean, 
any, you know, previous matches throughout the year. You know, it 
was just important for me to get off to a good start, and I did that, 
and when you get up to that first break, you know, everything just 
kind of relaxes. You can start enjoying it a little bit more. Chile's 
Marcelo Rios, who was hoping to overtake Sampras as world number one, 
was upset by Britain's Tim Henman 7-5, 6-1. Rios entered the season-ending 
tournament just 33 points behind Sampras in the world rankings. Rios 
needs at least two wins in the round robin tournament for a chance 
to replace Sampras as world number one. In other action, fourth-seeded 
Carlos Moya of Spain beat Karol Kucera of Slovakia in three sets. 
The tournament's eight players are divided into two groups of four 
players each in the round robin format. The top two players from each 
group advance to the semi-finals.
