It is Universal Time. U.S. Vice President Al Gore will not be facing 
a special prosecutor's investigation into his fund-raising activities 
during the 1996 campaign for reelection with President Clinton. Attorney 
General Janet Reno has finished a preliminary inquiry and is not seeking 
an independent counsel. Here's VOA's David Swan. The attorney general 
says she conducted a vigorous three-month probe and found no reason 
for any further inquiry. The issue was whether the vice president 
knowingly made illegal fund-raising phone calls from his White House 
office and lied about it to FBI agents last year. Mr. Gore said he 
believed the calls were collecting what is called soft money, donations 
that go to parties instead of individual campaigns and are largely 
unregulated. However, a White House memo appeared to contradict his 
account. The document suggests he knew some of those funds would be 
considered hard money, which is more tightly controlled and cannot 
be raised on federal property. The memo touched off Miss Reno's investigation 
and raised the prospect of a longer, politically explosive probe by 
an independent counsel like Kenneth Starr. Tuesday's decision removes 
a potential crippling threat to Mr. Gore's all but certain presidential 
bid in the year 2000. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart says President 
Clinton is also pleased. Well, obviously, the president welcomes that 
news, as he has always believed that the vice president acted completely 
properly during the campaign in 1996. But for Miss Reno, the move 
means more attacks from Republicans who accuse her of protecting the 
president and vice president from harm in the fund-raising matter. 
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch says she ignored a 
wide-ranging pattern of abuses and corruption. Now it is becoming 
very apparent to me -- and I think many others as well -- that we 
need to take these matters out of the hands of the attorney general 
who appears to be acting politically. Still, Miss Reno could decide 
to seek independent counsels in two more cases. One involves a former 
deputy White House chief of staff, Harold Ickes. The other is focused 
on President Clinton himself. Both rulings are expected in the next 
two weeks. David Swan, VOA News, Capitol Hill.
