From Atlanta, David Goodnow, "CNN Headline News." Newly released audio 
tapes are giving the public a clearer understanding of john F. Kennedy 
and his life in the White House. They include meetings and conversations 
held in the oval office and cabinet room. Others tapes are of telephone 
calls recorded on a dictaphone activated by the president's personal 
secretary. Bill Delaney has details. I have confidence -- Present 
as never before within the presidency of John F. Kennedy -- a release 
of 37 hours of recordings from Boston's Kennedy library, including 
four hours long held by the president's secretary, Evelyn lincoln. 
Kennedy, at one point setting out a memo, seeming to regret the assassination 
of south Vietnam's president, NGO dinh diem, following a coup kennedy 
endorsed only weeks before Kennedy himself was assassinated. I feel 
that we must bear a good deal of responsibility, for it, beginning

Nevertheless, over a ten-year period, he'd held his country together. 
Also included in the new recordings -- conversations with several 
former presidents, including with dwight Eisenhower on Cuba at the 
time of the missile crisis. We don't plan to invade Cuba under these 
conditions anyway. no. So if we can get them out, we're better off 
-- by far. That's great. I quite agree. From another era, voices setting 
the stage for history. Bill Delaney, CNN, Boston.
