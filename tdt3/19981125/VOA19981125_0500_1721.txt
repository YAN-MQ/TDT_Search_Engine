And we have this story out of California for Tuesday. There were a 
couple of pistols that were auctioned for nearly $35,000 in the City 
of San Francisco and, boy, what a history these pistols have. They 
were used in the last gun duel known to have been fought in the State 
of California. It was a shoot-out 140 years ago between a U.S. senator 
and a state supreme court justice. The two guns -- they were.58-caliber 
pistols -- were used in this 1849 shoot-out between Senator David 
Broderick and California Justice David Terry. The battle ended a bitter 
19th-century public dispute over slavery, which was opposed by the 
senator, supported by the judge. Judge Terry challenged the senator. 
The two met at the San Francisco County line. The senator died in 
the shoot-out, while Judge Terry abandoned politics for a military 
career in the Confederate Army.
