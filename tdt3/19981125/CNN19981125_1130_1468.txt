Thanksgiving just wouldn't be the same without Macy's annual Thanksgiving 
day parade. A Georgia high school band is 1 of only 12 marching in 
the parade. As Scott withers reports, these talented band members 
are ready for the big day. One, two, ready move. The Walton high school 
marching band from suburban Atlanta has been practicing for months 
-- tuning up their talents for a March on New York City. It's going 
to be a lot of pressure, I believe, especially for the drum majors. 
We have a lot to do to get prepared for this. The band is getting 
ready to take part in a national tradition -- the 72nd annual Macy's 
Thanksgiving day parade. Walton high school is 1 of only 12 marching 
bands in the parade. In tribute to a part-time Georgia resident, the 
band will perform Elton john's "funeral for a friend." Practice makes 
perfect. And they have been practicing up to for six hours every week 
since last spring. The more practice the better. We do practice a 
lot of hours a week but it keeps the concentration going. If we take 
a big break then we end up forgetting stuff. We practice a lot, and 
it improves every time. Each of the 278 students in the band had to 
raise $650 to pay for their trip to the big apple. As the clock ticks 
down to the big day, the students are confident they'll be ready. 
I think we've got it pretty under control. I think everybody's real 
excited, so that's going to help. Most of the kids are nervous. It 
will be intimidating to March down Broadway on live television much 
more than so than it ever is to March across their field here in Marietta, 
georgia. My entire family will be there. They all know about it. They, 
like, it's all written in the calendars to watch Macy's on thanksgiving 
day. The band members are not leaving anything to chance. They're 
going to keep up their grueling practice schedule right up to the 
last minute. Obviously, being on national TV, you want to you want 
to look the best that you can. So we're going to work really hard 
to look really well. No matter what happens, members say they've already 
achieved a Major goal. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for 
me, and I'm doing what I love best.
