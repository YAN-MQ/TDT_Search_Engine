So you want a great Thanksgiving meal, but you don't want to wrestle 
that frozen Turkey home from the supermarket? Holly Firfer looks at 
your options. Let's talk Turkey. Uh, this Turkey. Okay, we know of 
the traditional frozen bird you buy a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving. 
Supermarkets are finding a growing number of people don't want to 
defrost, so they are selling more fresh turkeys than ever before. 
To meet this growing demand, some are even selling premarinated, precooked 
flavored birds. Got a hankering for a cajun style? In a survey done 
by the nation's largest Turkey seller, butterball, 45% of the people 
said they are finding it increasingly difficult to prepare a Full 
Thanksgiving meal from scratch. Perhaps that's why one of the hottest 
trends this year is what the industry calls "the new traditional meal" 
-- letting someone else do the work. They want a meal they would prepare 
if they took the time in their home. Eatzi's is a market that sells 
preprepared foods. They expect to take 1,000 orders for Thanksgiving 
dinner. And that means stocking up. 1,000 pounds of potatoes, 8,000 
pounds of yellow squash, 600 pounds of onions, 900 pounds of Turkey 
and over 1,700 pies. And none of it is lowfat. According to those 
who follow the Thanksgiving trend, people don't want to watch their 
waistlines. They want the full deal. They want to put anything on 
top of that, because they want a good, thorough, Thanksgiving meal. 
a meal full of fat and calories. Here's a closer look at this "new 
traditional" meal. If people want it prepared for them, we have the 
Turkey that we cut here in house, and we have it ready for you to 
take home and heat up. As far as side items, we have green Bean casserole, 
sweet potato souffle, mashed potatoes, yellow squash casserole. We 
have the additions of gravy, Cranberry relish. We also have pies and 
wine to round out the meal. That's a grand total of 2,121 calories 
and 84 grams of fat in one meal. But it's not just a one-time deal. 
There are those leftovers. Holly Firfer, CNN, Atlanta.
