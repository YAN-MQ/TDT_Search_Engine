And for more on how the nation's highways are holding up this night 
before Thanksgiving, we turn to an expert standing in one of the nation's 
most heavily traveled highways, Bill jackman, with the Washington 
office of aaa, with us tonight from interstate 495. The nation knows 
it as the Washington Beltway. Bill, it has an unlikely distinction, 
really. It's a local road for commuters and handled a huge amount 
of volume. How are we doing so far? Doing very well, actually. There 
are still plenty of people on their way to grandmother's, but today 
this afternoon and from noon on it was tight all around the city getting 
out. They are saying this year -- and I don't know if it's typical 
of other years -- that it's going to be spread out, perhaps more so 
than in the past. Do you think that all these years of broadcasting, 
all these warnings and pictures of back-UPS have taken their toll 
and people are spreading out their travel? I think they are. They 
started last night out of Washington. It was very heavy, more than 
the normal rush hour. And we just hope that people come back early 
or stay later so that we don't have a mess on Sunday afternoon. 28 
million is the working figure of cars on the road? 28 is it. And that's 
about 2% more than last year, and it's the biggest one-day ever on 
the roads of this country. As we just heard, how much of that is attributable 
-- we took one look at the situation in Colorado -- to lower gas prices? 
I think some of it, certainly. It's 18 cents a gallon less than last 
Thanksgiving. That's a sizable cut. Bill jackman with aaa in Washington, 
an inside the Beltway type, at least for tonight. Thanks. My pleasure.
