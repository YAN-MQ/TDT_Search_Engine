The International Monetary Fund agreed Wednesday to rescue Pakistan's 
shattered economy from default, granting a dlrs 5.5 billion bailout 
package, finance officials said. Pakistan's economy has been reeling 
from international sanctions that followed nuclear tests in May, and 
owed a whopping dlrs 32 billion to international creditors. The biggest 
hurdle to the bailout package was removed earlier this month when 
the United States agreed to support a one-time deal for Pakistan despite 
sanctions imposed on both Pakistan and neighboring India last May. 
The United States imposed economic sanctions on Pakistan and its rival 
India after the two neighbors conducted underground nuclear tests 
in May. The embargo hit Pakistan especially hard, because it relied 
heavily on foreign loans and had meager reserves of hard currency 
needed to pay for imports. U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted some 
of the sanctions earlier this month. After announcing the policy reversal, 
Clinton assured Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a letter that the administration 
would exert its influence with international lenders ``to meet Pakistan's 
economic difficulties,'' according to a foreign ministry statement 
issued at the time. The sanctions were aimed at punishing the two 
often hostile neighbors, but India suffered only slightly. The bailout 
package for Pakistan also comes with a number of conditions, which 
include structural reform in its banking sector, tax reform to increase 
its tax base and revenue as well as a provision to try to reduce corruption. 
The deal still requires final approval from the IMF board of directors 
at a meeting in Washington next month, Pakistan's finance ministry 
officials said at a news conference in the capital, Islamabad. It 
is expected that Pakistan will have to find additional sources of 
revenue, although Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said the agreement with 
the IMF does not call for higher income tax or increased wealth tax. 
The deal gives Pakistan dlrs 1.3 billion from the IMF, Asian Development 
Bank and World Bank. The remainder of the money will be used to restructure 
loans.
