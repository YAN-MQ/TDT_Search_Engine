Argentine authorities have arrested a former military leader in connection 
with a kidnapping and sale of babies during the country's dirty war. 
A federal court ordered former Admiral Emilio Masada detained after 
investigators questioned him about the theft of babies born to suspected 
leftists during the 1976-to-1983 dictatorship. No charges have yet 
been filed.
