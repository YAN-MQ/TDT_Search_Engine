U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan says he may visit Libya next week 
in a bid to resolve the dispute over the Lockerbie bombing. The U.S., 
Britain, and Libya have agreed in principle that two Libyan suspects 
can go on trial in the Netherlands for their alleged role in blowing 
up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie. Rob Watson reports from the U.N. 
After years of stalemate, there is now a real sense here that a solution 
may be in sight. As he arrives at U.N. headquarters, Kofi Annan told 
reporters he hopes to bring the issue to a close by the end of this 
month. He said he would be in North Africa next week, and that a visit 
to Libya had not been excluded. Diplomatic sources here say the final 
decision, as ever, rests personally with the Libyan leader, Colonel 
Khaddhafi. But they add that he appears to be close to making that 
decision and taking the risk of handing the two men over. Rob Watson.
