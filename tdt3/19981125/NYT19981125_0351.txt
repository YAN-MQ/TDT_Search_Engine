In 1906 Dr. Frederick A. Cook took a photograph that made him famous 
and ultimately became perhaps the most controversial picture in the 
history of exploration. Now a historian has found the original, uncropped 
version of the picture, and it does not look good for Cook. A cropped 
version, captioned ``The Top of Our Continent,'' was published in 
1908 with Cook's account of how he had braved avalanches and ice cliffs 
to make the first ascent of Mount McKinley, the highest peak in North 
America. Cook described himself and his companion, Edward Barrill, 
as ``near the limit of human endurance'' _ exhausted, freezing, gasping 
for oxygen _ when they reached the Alaskan summit at 20,320 feet above 
sea level. ``At last!'' Cook wrote. ``The soul-stirring task was crowned 
with victory. The top of the continent was under our feet.'' After 
describing the vista of clouds and peaks spread out below, he exulted 
in the ``most impressive'' memory taken from the peak: ``the final 
picture which I took of Barrille'' _ as Cook misspelled the name _ 
``with the flag lashed to his ax, as the Arctic air froze the impression 
into a relief which no words can tell.'' Robert M. Bryce has two words 
for that image, and they are Fake Peak. Bryce, the author of the most 
exhaustive study of Cook's career, has analyzed a newly discovered 
print made from Cook's negative showing geographical features in the 
background that were cropped when Cook published the photograph. Bryce 
concludes that the photograph was taken on a small promontory 15,000 
feet below the McKinley summit, at barely 5,000 feet above sea level, 
about the altitude of Denver. This finding confirms the suspicions 
of Cook's critics, who long ago accused him of faking the McKinley 
summit picture and identified the site known as Fake Peak. But there 
were so few details visible in the picture published by Cook that 
it was difficult to determine exactly where it was taken until Bryce 
found the full print. ``I don't think Cook ever had any intention 
of going to the summit,'' Bryce said. ``From all the evidence, it 
looks as if Cook didn't go any higher than 5,000 feet on this McKinley 
trip. He apparently spotted this feature that he thought he could 
pass off as the summit, and it was easy to stage the photograph because 
Barrill had to climb only a few hundred feet above the glacier floor.'' 
Bryce found the photograph in papers of Cook that were donated recently 
to the polar archives at Ohio State University. Bryce, the author 
of a 1997 book, ``Cook and Peary,'' a 1,100-page account of Cook's 
rivalry with Robert E. Peary, published his analysis of the photograph 
in the current issue of DIO, a journal devoted to the history of science 
and exploration. ``People have been arguing about Cook on McKinley 
for 90 years,'' said Dennis Rawlins, the journal's publisher and a 
historian of the Arctic. ``This is the single biggest find, because 
it proves positively from Cook's own camera that he was lying.'' The 
controversy has endured because it was the McKinley claim that made 
Cook's reputation and eventually ruined his name during his fight 
with Robert Peary. Cook's apparent success on McKinley promptly won 
him support for an expedition to the North Pole, from which he returned 
triumphantly in 1909. More than 100,000 people turned out in Brooklyn 
for a parade welcoming him home. Icicles dripped from a huge triumphal 
arch above Bushwick Avenue adorned with a sign, ``We believe in you.'' 
Cook had been accused of faking his North Pole trip by Robert Peary, 
who had also just returned with his own claim on the Pole, but the 
public was on Cook's side. He was seen as the romantic underdog, a 
charming Brooklynite who had climbed McKinley and reached the pole 
largely on his own. Peary was the establishment figure, a dour man 
backed by Manhattan millionaires and the National Geographic Society, 
who had relied on an army of Inuits for his Arctic exploration. But 
the Peary forces won the public-relations war by tracking down rumors 
about the McKinley climb. The New York Globe &AMP; Commercial Advertiser, 
whose publisher was the president of the club of Peary patrons, published 
an affidavit from Barrill explaining the photo hoax and declaring 
that he and Cook had never climbed McKinley. ``Smashed is Dr. Cook,'' 
declared The Globe. ``The similarities between the Mount McKinley 
hoax and the North Pole hoax are readily discernible.'' The New York 
Times, which had sponsored Peary's expedition, joined in the attack 
on Cook. The news caused The New York Herald, which had sponsored 
Cook's expedition, to mute its support for the doctor, and Peary was 
generally acknowledged as the only one to reach the North Pole. Today 
most historians believe that both explorers were lying. Peary is thought 
to have gotten closer to the pole, but not all the way. Cook is generally 
thought to have reached neither the pole nor the McKinley summit. 
Explorers have known about Fake Peak since 1910, when an expedition 
found it by following Barrill's directions. But because it has been 
impossible to duplicate Cook's photograph precisely, due to changed 
snow conditions and an earthquake that dislodged some rocks from the 
promontory, Cook's defenders continued to maintain that it was not 
the same place photographed by the doctor. The Cook photograph uncovered 
by Bryce reveals new background details that precisely match those 
at the site of Fake Peak, such as a nearby cliff and a distant peak, 
Mount Grosvenor. Now even Cook's supporters acknowledge that the doctor 
might not have been telling the truth, although they are still not 
ready to abandon him. ``There's fairly strong evidence that the photograph 
wasn't taken at the summit,'' said Ted Heckathorn, a member of the 
Cook Society, a group with headquarters in Sullivan County, N.Y., 
that is dedicated to defending the explorer's reputation. ``But even 
if it wasn't, that doesn't prove he couldn't have climbed to the summit 
anyway.'' Few historians or explorers share that view. ``Cook's account 
of his climb is utterly ridiculous,'' said Bradford Washburn, the 
retired director of the Boston Science Museum, who has mapped Mount 
McKinley and climbed it three times, and has published an analysis 
of Cook's diary and photographs. ``The tragedy is that he would have 
been remembered as a good explorer if he'd just truthfully reported 
what he accomplished near McKinley. But the Devil took him up on to 
a mount, and the doctor listened.''
