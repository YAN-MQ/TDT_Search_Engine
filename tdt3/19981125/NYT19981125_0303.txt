In a year of finger-pointing, accusations and acrimony inside the 
Beltway, yet another target has emerged in the capital: the traditional 
Thanksgiving feast. A private food safety group, which previously 
condemned Chinese food as high in fat and movie popcorn as low in 
nutritional value, is warning that turkeys may bring ``unwelcome guests'' 
_ campylobacter and salmonella, bacteria commonly found in poultry 
_ to the table. Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for 
the group, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, noted that 
a study conducted by the Agriculture Department in 1996 and 1997 on 
more than 1,200 young turkeys showed that 90 percent were contaminated 
with campylobacter and 18 percent carried salmonella. The group was 
founded in 1971 with a focus on nutrition and food safety. The organization 
publishes the Nutrition Action Healthletter and receives the majority 
of its support from its 1 million subscribers. Other groups are using 
the holiday to emphasize what government and industry are doing to 
ensure safety and what cooks can do to reduce risks. In January, after 
the Agriculture Department study was completed, a new system of meat 
inspection was put into effect in the nation's largest slaughter and 
packing plants. The new techniques require microbiological testing 
to detect invisible pathogens, which are the major cause of foodborne 
illness. The full impact of the new system will not be felt until 
January, when it goes into effect in 3,000 small and medium-size plants. 
Sherrie Rosenblatt, a spokeswoman for the National Turkey Federation 
in Washington, an industry association that represents 95 percent 
of the nation's turkey producers, said her members worked hard to 
ensure safe meals. ``The turkey industry has been aggressive in removing 
naturally occurring pathogens,'' Ms. Rosenblatt said. Dr. Elizabeth 
Whelan of the American Council on Science and Health, a consumer advocacy 
group in New York City, said, ``It is unrealistic to call upon the 
government to police every last bacteria.'' To remind consumers that 
all food items contain naturally occurring chemicals, the council 
posts a holiday menu each year on its Web site, which lists the chemicals 
found in dishes, including baked potato, pumpkin pie, cranberry sauce 
and, of course, turkey. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, in a statement 
Nov. 19, urged cooks to be careful while preparing food. ``Everyone 
has a role to play in ensuring food safety,'' he said. ``The final 
critical point for preventing foodborne illness is the kitchen of 
every American home.'' The Agriculture Department lists these basic 
suggestions: Thaw the turkey in its original wrapper in the refrigerator, 
allowing 24 hours per 5 pounds of turkey. If using stuffing, stuff 
the bird loosely just before placing it in the oven. Wash hands, utensils 
and surfaces often with warm, soapy water. Most important, insert 
the thermometer in the thigh area, near the breast, but not touching 
the bone, making certain that the internal temperature reads 180 degrees 
Fahrenheit.
