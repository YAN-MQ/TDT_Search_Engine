Good evening. We are going to begin in Michigan tonight. That's where 
Dr. Jack Kevorkian has been charged with murder. Millions of people 
saw Dr. Kevorkian kill a man on television. If a jury believes that 
it's murder, then this most radical advocate of mercy killing may 
be sentenced to life. We'll start first with our legal correspondent 
Terry Moran. Terri, there you R sounds pretty open and shut, at least 
at a distance. is it? Well, the facts reason the in dispute here, 
Peter. There's no question about this. This is a case, however, that 
will come down to an argument. It's about the rhetoric of mercy killing. 
Stirring up the jurors emotions appealing to their sense of mercy 
for the plight of, in this case, Thomas youk, and the prosecutor is 
kind of at a Disadvantage. They tend to talk about generalities, the 
rule of law. It's Jack Kevorkian and his team who focus on the actual 
suffering that the jurors will witness. Yet in Michigan there is an 
actual law. Absolutely. Not only is there a law against assisted suicide, 
but he's been charged with murder. There is a difference it time around. 
When he started this several years ago, he was like a prove fit in 
the wilderness. Now, however, people in Michigan through their legislature 
and directly last November, have dealt with this through the democratic 
process. He's not just defying a faceless government, he's defying 
the voters. He was let out on bail today. Well, Jack Kevorkian is 
a wild card for any judge to handle. The last time he was put in jail 
he started starving himself. I think that the judge in this case took 
his word that he would not participate in any assisted suicides during 
the pendencecy of this case and let him go. Thank you very much. Terry 
Moran our legal affairs correspondent.
