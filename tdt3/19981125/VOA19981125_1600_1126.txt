Pete Sampras of the United States and Alex Corretja of Spain were 
winners, and the final match of the day between Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
of Russia and Karol Kucera is finally over. Let's go to John Meyers 
in Hanover, Germany, at the ATP championships and find out who won. 
It looked like a major battle, but, in the end, a comfortable victory 
for the Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov by 2 sets to 1. That after losing 
the first set to Karol Kucera in a tie break. He started to gain the 
upper hand in the second set-breaking serve in the fourth game to 
take that 6-3, and after breaking the Slovak's serve in the second 
game of the first set, he cruised to a 6-2 victory to make it 2 sets 
to 1. And remember Kafelnikov said after his first-match defeat in 
straight sets to Andre Agassi that he still thought he'd return to 
face the American in the final, and his campaign's now back on track. 
Let's briefly give you news of the other American Andre Agassi who 
was forced to concede to Corretja earlier today whilst trailing in 
the deciding set. He's decided to leave it overnight before deciding 
whether he'll be fit enough to play his next round robin match against 
the world number two Marcelo Rios. If he decides to pull out, it's 
the Britain Greg Rusedski who'll stand in as a replacement. John Meyers 
for VOA Sports in Hanover, Germany. Thank you very much, John.
