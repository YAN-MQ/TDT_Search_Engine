In Washington state, utility companies are rushing to restore power 
in time for Thanksgiving. 90-mile-an-hour winds blasted the area for 
two days, knocking down trees and ripping roofs from buildings. 300,000 
people were left without power in the pacific northwest. One death 
is blamed on the storm. More rain is forecast, and flood watches are 
in effect for parts of washington state and Oregon.
