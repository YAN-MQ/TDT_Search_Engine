Late on our program, another extradition battle, this one between 
Turkey and Italy over Kurdish chief Abdullah Urjalon. It appears that 
if you are anti-Communist and are accused of some 3,000 killings like 
Pinochet, then you should be extradited and hounded to the end of 
the world. If you are accused of 30,000 murders, then you are a political 
effigy. And this is the kind of double standard which doesn't bode 
well for international cooperation. That story coming up later in 
our show.
