Hippos at the Los Angeles zoo received their Thanksgiving meal early. 
Tuesday they got yams, pumpkins, corn and squash in addition to their 
regular breakfast of 12 heads of lettuce, 20 pounds of hay, 10 pounds 
of carrots and 10 pounds of apples. The hippos ate everything, including 
the decorations, in half an hour.
