I'll be right back with the frantic search for intelligent life -- 
at the toy store. I never get up early to powerwalk or power jog. 
But I'll be at the JCPenney after Thanksgiving sale at seven A.M. 
Friday. Where I'll save fifty percent on select stuff storewide while 
quantities last. With power shopping I know I'll see results. Ice 
is being I know a place... American's love scenery. We can't get enough 
of it we don't care how far it is... we want to see it all. Good thing 
there's Chevy Malibu. A car designed to take us anywhere and back. 
It'll actually go up to 100,000 miles before its first scheduled tuneup. 
That's a lot of vacations. and a lot of souvenirs. So take the long 
way home. It's the car you knew America could build. Malibu. Genuine 
Chevrolet. I'll take you there. Teddy gibbs toughs it out through 
the raw soar throat, the hacking cough, the fever. Now he needs... 
maximum strength theraflu. Fast, soothing hot liquid theraflu. Pretend 
the puppy's a salesperson in an average computer store. Now, ask the 
salesperson a question. What's the difference between dvd and CD rom? 
How much ram do I really need? Oh, and can you guys install software? 
Okay, thanks. We built a different place to buy a computer. Gateway 
country, staffed with trained people who'll have a computer 9999 built 
just for you starting as low as $999. Gateway country. get more out 
of the box. Drop by any store or call 1-800-gateway.
