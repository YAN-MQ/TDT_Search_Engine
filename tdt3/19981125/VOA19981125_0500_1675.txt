In Saint Clair County, Illinois, sheriff's deputies say they've got 
a burglar who didn't leave his victims empty handed. He reportedly 
gave them play money. Authorities say at least four people found the 
play money in place of the items that had been stolen from their cars. 
In one case, the thief allegedly left $15 in play money after taking 
a wallet. In another, he's said to have left a pile of fake bills 
in exchange for a pair of sunglasses. Deputies say one person confronted 
the suspect when he was getting out of that person's family car with 
a radar detector in his hand. Deputies arrived and searched the suspect, 
Andrew Dunlop. They say he was wearing a coat believed to have been 
stolen from another car. Police say that in his pockets were a stolen 
wallet and wad of play money.
