Here in the United States, Vice President Al Gore's political future 
has received a boost with the decision by U.S. Attorney General Janet 
Reno not to seek an independent probe of his fund-raising activities. 
At issue was whether Mr. Gore lied to investigators about his efforts 
to raise money for the 1996 Clinton/Gore reelection campaign. Miss 
Reno's decision removes the possibility for now of a politically embarrassing 
investigation of Mr. Gore before his expected run for the presidency 
in the year 2000.
