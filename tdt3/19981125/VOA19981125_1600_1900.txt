Chinese President Jiang Zemin has begun an historic visit to Japan 
seeking a 21st-century partnership between Asia's two economic and 
military giants. Mr. Jiang is the first Chinese head of state to visit 
Japan. He arrived after a visit to Russia and a meeting with the ailing 
President Boris Yeltsin. Security is very tight for the Chinese leader. 
Even before his arrival, right-wing demonstrators were using loud 
speakers to protest an expected Japanese apology for wartime atrocities.
