Police have dropped an investigation into a Saudi prince accused of 
mistreating his Egyptian servants after they withdrew the complaints, 
officials said Wednesday. The row ended amicably after nine servants 
withdrew allegations that they were locked up by Prince Turki bin 
Abdel Aziz in the 29th floor suite of a luxury hotel where he and 
his wife have lived for 16 years, the officials said. The servants 
resigned and left after collecting their wages, said the officials, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. Police began the investigation 
after two servants escaped from the prince's 29th floor suite on Monday 
by knotting sheets together and lowering themselves through a window 
to the 24th floor. They told police that other servants were still 
locked up. During investigations, the nine servants came forward to 
back up that claim. It was not clear why they withdrew the complaint 
now. But the initial complaint of the two servants still stands. One 
of them was hospitalized for treatment of bone injuries and bruises 
he sustained during the escape. The issue attracted wide publicity 
in Egypt and the matter was raised in Parliament on Sunday. It is 
not clear if any charges have been filed against the prince, who is 
one of Saudi King Fahd's six brothers. In a similar case earlier this 
year, which was also settled by the police, the prince was quoted 
as saying that the servants usually sign an agreement not to leave 
the suite for six months. Prince Turki has been living in Egypt for 
16 years since he fell out with the royal family. Last year, police 
arrested one of the prince's American bodyguards after he allegedly 
punched two men who objected to his blocking a road with his car. 
Three others, including an American, were deported from Egypt in 1995 
over similar incidents.
