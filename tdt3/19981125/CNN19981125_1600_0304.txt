A Navy admiral faces charges of adultery, lying, obstruction of justice 
and ethics violations. The Navy says the charges against rear admiral 
John scudi stem from relationships with two women. Scudi is charged 
with granting Navy contracts to a company that employed one of the 
women. He has been removed from his job. He faces either nonjudicial 
punishment or an article 32 hearing, which could lead to a court-martial.
