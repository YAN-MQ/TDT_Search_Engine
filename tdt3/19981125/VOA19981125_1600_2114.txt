Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund have reached agreement 
on a financial aid loan package. The IMF says it will immediately 
reactivate a stalled loan to Pakistan worth more than a billion dollars. 
Pakistan is also now eligible to receive up to $5 billion in emergency 
aid from international lenders. The agreement on resuming aid followed 
more than two weeks of tough talks in Islamabad between the IMF and 
senior Pakistani officials. That's the latest. I'm Robert Burns, VOA 
News.
