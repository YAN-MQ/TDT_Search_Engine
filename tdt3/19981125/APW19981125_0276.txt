Romania's central bank intervened Wednesday to shore up the country's 
national currency, which dropped for the first time to more than 10,000 
lei to the dollar. It cost 10,045 lei to buy one dollar Wednesday, 
up by 0.55 percent from the day before. The leu fell from 9,990 lei 
to one dollar on Tuesday. The central bank was selling dollars at 
noon Wednesday to prop up the lei, which according to dealers is still 
overvalued. Central bank official Adrian Vasilescu was quoted by daily 
Libertatea as saying the underlying reasons behind the weakening leu 
were the country's trade deficit, a falling gross domestic product 
and low production. In October, yearly inflation reached 47 percent, 
while the leu fell by 30 percent in the same period.
