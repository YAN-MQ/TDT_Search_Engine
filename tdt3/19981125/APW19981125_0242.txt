Belgium joined the list of nations Wednesday that want to try former 
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet who is in Britain fighting 
extradition to Spain. Brussels magistrate Daniel Vermeersch issued 
an arrest warrant after ruling that a complaint against Pinochet by 
four Chileans living here has merit. The four accuse Pinochet of jailing 
and murdering their relatives. Pinochet is in a London hospital. He 
was arrested Oct. 16 after spinal surgery on a Spanish warrant seeking 
his extradition on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture during 
his 17-year regime. France and Switzerland also seek his extradition. 
Later Wednesday, Britain's highest court will rule if Pinochet enjoys 
immunity from arrest as a former foreign head of state. Also Wednesday, 
the Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade Unions 
said it has launched a civil suit in Belgium against Pinochet to ``contribute, 
with ample proof, to the efforts to win redress for the crimes against 
humanity perpetrated by the former Chilean dictator.'' The ICFTU said 
in a statement ``hundreds of democratic trade unionists were arrested 
during the military junta's dictatorship and scores were tortured, 
assassinated or `disappeared' after their capture by the former Chilean 
political police, the DINA.''
