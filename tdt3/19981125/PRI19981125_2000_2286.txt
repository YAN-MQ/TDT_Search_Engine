Tomorrow, while many of you are breaking bread and pouring on the 
gravy, 86 women from around the world will be sucking in their gut 
vying to become the next Miss World. And the place where these natural 
and nearly natural beauties are gathering for the 48th annual Miss 
World Beauty Pageant just happens to be the site of today's Geography 
Quiz. Past competitions were held in Britain, Hong Kong, South Africa, 
and India, but this year's site may be the most strangely appropriate 
of them all. It's home to the Cocoa DeMeer palm tree, which produces 
the world's largest nuts. At 40 pounds, this nut is shaped like a 
woman's pelvis, so they say, and for this reason, it's become a collector's 
item. Another bizarre claim to fame in this spot in the Indian Ocean 
is that it's the home of Esmeralda, the world famous 150-year-old 
turtle. Don't hide under your shell. Stick your neck out and figure 
out where they will crown the next Miss World. We'll tell you later 
this half hour.
