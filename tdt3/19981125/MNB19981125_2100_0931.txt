A look at the W. we go to W NBC TV in New York. Hi, Brian. The weather 
is aggravating in two spots. There is a storm running through the 
Ohio valley with heavy rain. Just through Detroit, hail in parts of 
Kentucky with thunderstorms. This line will affect all the major cities 
in the east tomorrow with rain on Thanksgiving. In the northwest, 
still more strong, gusty winds, hurricane force winds along the Oregon 
coast, heavy rain with flood warnings in effect and heavy snow in 
the mountains. That will continue tomorrow. No major changes. Northern 
California will see some rain, but from San Francisco soult to L.A., 
a sunny Thanksgiving. Temperatures will be mild. High pressure over 
most of the country. But the east coast looking for rain and even 
some snow across New England on Thanksgiving day. Brian, when we come 
back, we'll have oots look at the weather for holiday shoppers for 
the rest of the week.
