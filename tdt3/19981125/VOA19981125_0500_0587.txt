The polls are open in four Indian states for assembly elections. Voting 
began early today under the watchful eyes of security forces in New 
Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and the northeastern state of Mizoram. 
The internationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which leads India's multi-party 
federal government, governs two of the four states, while the opposition 
Congress Party rules the other two. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 
says the vote will not affect his coalition, but many analysts view 
the elections as a test of popularity for the BJP. Pre-election surveys 
have predicted gains by the Congress Party because of widespread discontent 
with the soaring price of vegetables. Congress leader Sonia Ghandi 
criticized the government for failing to prevent the price increases.
