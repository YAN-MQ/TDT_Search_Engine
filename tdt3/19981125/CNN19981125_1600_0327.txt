Former Chilean dictator general augusto Pinochet will have to stay 
in london for now. Britain's highest court has ruled he does not have 
immunity from arrest. Pinochet will remain under police guard while 
Spain seeks his extradition on charges of murder, torture and genocide. 
The British home secretary will decide whether extradition proceedings 
can continue. Human rights activists are calling the decision a victory 
and a warning to authoritarian regimes. It is a great day for human 
rights internationally. Not only for just chileans, for the Latin 
American community, for amnesty international. It is a historical 
moment. It means that there is going to be justice internationally. 
That dictators throughout the world will know they have to answer 
for their crime no matter where they commit it. This is a great end 
to the millennium . In Chile, 300 pro-Pinochet activists clashed with 
police following the decision. The demonstrators say Pinochet deserves 
immunity because he's a former head of state.
