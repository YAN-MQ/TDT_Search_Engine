'tis the season for giving. Last year, Americans gave $143 billion 
to charities, contributing on average 2% of their paychecks. Greg 
clarkin offers some tips on maximizing your holiday contributions. 
Brace yourself for the onslaught. 40% of charity fund-raising takes 
place in November and December. But before breaking out a wallet or 
checkbook, take a closer look at where your money is headed. The unscrupulous 
operators out there are counting on the fact that most individuals 
are not going to bother to ask for more information or question them. 
Charity watchdog organizations say, don't give without doing extensive 
homework. It's a bad sign if you're pressured for immediate donations 
or cash contributions. A minimum of 50% to 60% of every dollar should 
be used for actual services provided, instead of overhead or marketing. 
Raising money should cost no more than 35% of every dollar raised. 
And beware of professional telemarketers. A lot of the time you are 
being solicited by professional outside solicitors that are businesses 
out there to make a profit. And on average when a professional telemarketer 
calls you up asking for funds, only one-third of the money you give 
is going to the cause. Once you have picked your charities, consider 
giving stock instead of cash -- particularly stocks showing large 
gains. Take that appreciated security and give it directly to the 
charity. You are still getting the same tax deduction for the market 
value of the contribution, and you are avoiding the long-term appreciation. 
But sell your stocks with losses first, and then contribute the money, 
or you lose the tax deduction. Finally, make sure the charity is tax 
exempt. And get a receipt for all donations of $250 or more. That's 
"your money," Greg clarkin, "CNN Financial News," New York.
