Diego Maradona will demand financial compensation for an erroneous 
drug test taken during his playing days in Italy, his manager said 
Wednesday. Maradona is expected to fly on Thursday to Italy where 
he is scheduled to appear on a popular Italian television program. 
His plans could however be complicated by his desire to watch his 
former club team play for the league championship on Sunday. Guillermo 
Coppola told the Buenos Aires sports daily Ole that Maradona plans 
to appear before a judge investigating irregularities at an Italian 
drug testing facility where he once tested positive for drug use. 
As a result, Maradona was suspended from Italian first-division play 
for 15 months after the test revealed traces of cocaine in his backup 
urine sample. Coppola didn't indicate what day the star planned to 
make his court appearance. He said the 38-year-old star wants some 
kind of financial compensation from the Italian Football Federation 
if it's proven that the Acqua Acetosa laboratory where his drug test 
results were processed is at fault. Coppola didn't indicate what amount 
the star might demand. The Italian lab has come under intense scrutiny 
recently and was blamed for mishandling drug tests and documentation 
of their results. It closed last month. A confessed cocaine addict, 
Maradona has always maintained his innocence, saying he often took 
his own private tests before matches. He was suspended a second time 
in 1994 for another 15 months after tesing positive for stimulant 
use during the 1994 World Cup in the United States. Maradona charged 
the suspension was revenge for Argentina's 1990 World Cup victory 
over Italy.
