This week on the "cold & flu report" -- winter is approaching. And 
along with cold weather comes the yearly rise in the common cold and 
the flu. Contrary to popular belief, doctors say it's not the cold 
weather that makes us sick, it's the fact that cold weather drives 
us indoors. That means more contact between people and more opportunity 
for diseases to spread. Wintertime also means we'll be turning the 
heat up. The hot, dry air produced by heaters sucks the moisture out 
of our nasal passages making us more susceptible to infection. The 
two ways to lessen this problem are to use humidifiers and drink plenty 
of liquids.
