Egypt has rounded up about 100 members of two outlawed Islamic groups 
in the southern part of the country. Dale Gavlack reports from Cairo. 
Police arrested about a hundred members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood 
and Jihad groups in Beirut some 195 miles south of Cairo. The men 
were rounded up because they belonged to illegal organizations. The 
Jihad participated in the 1981 assassination of former President Anwar 
Sadat and used violence to fight Egypt's government. The Muslim brotherhood 
seeks an Islamic state but says it wants to achieve it by peaceful 
means. Officials report that Egypt executed three members of the country's 
largest militant group, the Gana Islamaia, on Sunday. They were charged 
with heading factions up the Gana Islamaia, recruiting members and 
plotting to kill government officials. For NPR News, I'm Dale Gavlack 
in Cairo.
