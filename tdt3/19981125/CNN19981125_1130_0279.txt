A Navy admiral has been charged with adultery, lying, obstruction 
of justice and ethics violations. The Navy says the charges against 
rear admiral John scudi stem from relationships with two women. Scudi 
allegedly granted Navy contracts to a company that employed one of 
the women. He has been removed from his job. He faces either nonjudicial 
punishment or an article 32 hearing which could lead to a court-martial.
