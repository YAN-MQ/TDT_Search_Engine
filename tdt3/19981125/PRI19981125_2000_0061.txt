Jack Kevorkian is free on $750,000 bail after he was charged today 
with first degree premeditated murder in the televised death of a 
patient with Lou Gehrig's disease. Oakland County prosecutor David 
Gorsica also accused Kevorkian of criminal assistance to a suicide 
and delivery of a controlled substance, both felonies. The charge 
is based on the death of Thomas Yauk, a 52-year-old Lou Gehrig's disease 
patient. Kevorkian called the death a euthanasia and he provided CBS 
Television with a homemade videotape in which he was shown giving 
Yauk injections. CBS aired an edited version of the tape on Sunday's 
"60 Minutes" program.
