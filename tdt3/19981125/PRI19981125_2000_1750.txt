Much more news still to come on THE WORLD. This is PRI, Public Radio 
International. Wouldn't it be great if you knew who was going to be 
on "Fresh Air" tomorrow, not to mention "Radio Times," "Talk of the 
Nation," "Morning Edition," and more? Well, your wishes have been 
answered because now 91 FM will send you that information automatically 
every day by electronic mail. To subscribe, visit the 91 FM section 
of the WHYY Web site and follow the simple instructions. The Web site 
is located at whyy.org. Once again, that's whyy.org. I'm Lisa Mullins. 
Still to come on THE WORLD, Italy has him, Turkey wants him, but nobody 
can agree on the fate of Abdullah Urjalon. And proponents of a new 
system for donating blood in Quebec hope to avoid a tainted past. 
We're doing everything that is in the book and more to make sure that 
the health and the life of Canadians is, you know, into good hands. 
First, this news. For THE WORLD, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC 
newsroom in London.
