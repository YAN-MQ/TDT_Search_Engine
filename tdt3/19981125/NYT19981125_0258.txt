Telephones used to be more predictable. They were generally tethered 
securely to a wall, and when they rang, well, they rang. Today, telephones 
are adrift, floating like dandelion seeds throughout the environment, 
and they don't ring. They warble. Lately, the cunning little mobile 
phones that people like to carry _ the ones that also send e-mail 
and receive stock market quotations _ have been emitting more elaborate 
sounds. During a recent lunch in a Berlin restaurant, for instance, 
one of my companions suddenly had what sounded like an especially 
squeaky Brandenburg concerto emanating from his pocket. It was his 
mobile phone. Indeed, the Finnish company Nokia and the Swedish company 
Ericsson sell phones that offer a wide selection of programmed musical 
rings _ from a Scott Joplin rag to ``Auld Lang Syne'' _ but you don't 
hear these melodic snippets very often in the United States. Not yet, 
anyway. In some European countries, where upwards of 40 percent of 
the population is equipped with a mobile phone (compared to 23 percent 
here), there is greater need for a distinctive ring. At least, that's 
the simple explanation. The very newest mobile phones allow owners 
to program favorite tunes or original compositions. The brightly colored 
Ericsson CF 768 is packaged with a chart that assigns musical notes 
to each button on the key pad, and explains how to produce sharps, 
flats and rests. Following instructions found on an independent Web 
site run by a 21-year-old Australian computer programmer (www.nogi.net), 
a repository of hundreds of songs specially arranged to be played 
on the Ericsson, I punched in a tinsely version of Herb Alpert's ``Tijuana 
Taxi.'' It's an arduous process, and at the end, I felt strangely 
satisfied, as if I had mastered a piano etude. Beyond helping mobile-phone 
owners to pick out their ring in a crowd, the individualized, anthemic 
sound is a way of humanizing a technological device. ``A cellular 
phone is a personal product,'' reasoned Gary Dorfner, a senior product 
line manager for Ericsson. ``You want to create an affinity with the 
users, so they say, `Hey, this is my phone.' '' Ben Rubin, who teaches 
a course called Sonic Design at New York University's Interactive 
Telecommunications Program and who has designed a system that would 
replace the electronic bleeps of the New York subway's turnstiles 
with more pleasing musical sounds, doesn't think the music played 
by mobile phones is any kind of improvement. ``I don't want to hear 
the `William Tell' Overture when my phone is ringing,'' he said. Rubin 
does, however, concur with the Ericsson marketers about the significance 
of distinctive rings. ``I want my ring to be short, quiet, complex 
and uniquely mine,'' he declared, ``an expression of my taste.'' Rubin 
believes that the existing sounds are ``too primitive to fulfill my 
desires.'' But then, he hasn't heard the latest from Finland. ``The 
annoyance of ringing mobile phones in public places has been discussed 
a lot in Finland,'' said two Nokia technologists, Seppo Helle, a user-interface 
software designer, and Outi Kortevaara, an audio specialist, who replied 
jointly to questions I sent to them by e-mail. ``The issue may be 
here more acute since Finland currently has the largest mobile phone 
penetration in the world _ over 50 percent.'' Nokia is about to introduce 
a mobile phone, the 9110, with rings that Helle and Ms. Kortevaara 
say are ``softer and cleaner,'' due to improved speaker technology. 
It will, they add, produce natural sounds, not cheap electronic imitations. 
Helle sent along a file of two dozen surprising new ringer noises. 
Some are musical: a classical guitar piece, played on a real guitar 
that retains much of its natural resonance, and an intentionally fuzzy 
rock guitar solo. Some are funny: a human voice imitating the b-r-r-ring 
of a telephone ring. Undoubtedly these sounds, refreshing on the first 
listen, will quickly become a form of noise pollution. But all of 
them _ with the possible exception of a long, horsy laugh _ are far 
less irritating than any existing ring. One more thing: Dorfner spoke 
to me from his own cellular phone. He told me he had adjusted his 
phone to emit ``a quiet little beep,'' because he was attending a 
gathering of Ericsson executives. If everyone in the room had their 
ringer programmed to play ``Stairway to Heaven'' or the theme from 
``Star Wars,'' well, you can imagine.
