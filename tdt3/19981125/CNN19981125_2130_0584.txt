The Chilean government says it will continue to work for the release 
of general augusto Pinochet. For now, the former dictator will remain 
under police guard at a London hospital. A five-judge house of lords 
panel ruled today Pinochet does not have diplomatic immunity and upheld 
his arrest by British authorities last month. Spain is seeking his 
extradition on charges of murder, torture and genocide. Human rights 
activists are pleased with the decision. So are the families of the 
estimated 3,000 chileans who disappeared during pinochet's 17-year 
rule.
