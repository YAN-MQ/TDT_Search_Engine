Ukrainian police have detained two brothers suspected of stabbing 
to death three people during a drunken brawl, a newspaper reported 
Wednesday. The bodies of the three victims, a 47-year-old woman and 
two men aged 39 and 50, were found soon after the Nov. 18 slaying 
in the southeastern town of Zaporizhia, Kievskiye Vedomosti quoted 
police as saying. Authorities detained the suspects _ an Afghan war 
veteran and his brother, who already had served time in prison _ on 
Monday, the report said.
