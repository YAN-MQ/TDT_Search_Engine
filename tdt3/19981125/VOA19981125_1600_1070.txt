And now it's time for sports with VOA's Steve Shine. Thank you very 
much. The National Basketball Association owners have canceled Saturday's 
bargaining session with the players' union, and no additional meetings 
have been scheduled. Less than one week after the two sides seemed 
to be heading in the direction of a settlement of the nearly five-long-month 
-- or five-month-long lockout, a misunderstanding over an escrow fund 
proposal has led to another standoff between the players and owners. 
The NBA owners wanted a rule that would prevent clubs from using a 
salary cap exception to sign their own free agents if they sign free 
agents from another club. Players say the rule would render the exception 
meaningless and, in effect, create the salary cap they have vowed 
not to accept. The latest delay further jeopardizes the entire season 
and comes one day after the league announced the cancellation of a 
televised doubleheader scheduled for Christmas Day.
