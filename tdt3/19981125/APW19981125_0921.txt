A cocktail waitress who sued Dennis Rodman for assault this month 
has filed a criminal complaint against the NBA star. The action, confirmed 
Wednesday by authorities and the woman's lawyer, comes two days after 
Rodman filed papers to end his marriage to actress Carmen Electra. 
They wed in Las Vegas on Nov. 14, and Rodman now wants an annulment, 
citing fraud and unsound mind. Susan Patterson says Rodman jammed 
a dlrs 100 bill down her blouse and grabbed her breast while she was 
working at the Fenix in the Argyle Hotel in West Hollywood. The criminal 
complaint was filed Tuesday with the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department, 
Deputy Terry Holden and lawyer Gloria Allred said. Like the lawsuit 
she filed Nov. 10, the criminal complaint cites assault, battery, 
negligence, false imprisonment and emotional distress in a confrontation 
with Rodman on Oct. 3. Detectives will decide whether to ask the local 
prosecutor if charges should be filed. ``I have all the confidence 
in the police to make an intelligent decision,'' Rodman's agent, Dwight 
Manley, said today. Gerry Phillips, the lawyer who filed Rodman's 
petition in Orange County Superior Court, said the couple married 
at 7 a.m. after being out drinking, separated the same day and haven't 
seen each other since. Rodman ``didn't have all his faculties about 
him'' at the time of the wedding, Phillips said. Electra's publicist 
denied that her client took advantage of Rodman, as his agent claimed 
two days after the wedding. However, spokeswoman Cindy Guagenti did 
acknowledge the marriage quickly unraveled and that both had agreed 
to end the marriage. Manley said previously the 26-year-old actress 
who once starred on ``Baywatch'' exploited his client. Rodman, 37, 
is the rebounding champion in the U.S. National Basketball Association.
