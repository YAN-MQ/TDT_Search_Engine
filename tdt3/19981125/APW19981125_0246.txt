Dennis Rodman is on the rebound, by his own choice. Rodman, the eccentric 
Chicago Bulls star, and actress Carmen Electra were married Nov. 14 
in Las Vegas, but the couple didn't stay together long. And it appears 
there won't be a reconciliation. Rodman filed papers Monday seeking 
an annulment, citing fraud and unsound mind. Gerry Phillips, the lawyer 
who filed Rodman's petition in Orange County Superior Court, said 
the couple married at 7 a.m. after being out partying, separated the 
same day and haven't seen each other since. Rodman ``didn't have all 
his faculties about him'' at the time of the wedding, Phillips said. 
Electra's publicist denied that her client took advantage of Rodman, 
as his agent, Dwight Manley, claimed two days after the wedding. However, 
spokeswoman Cindy Guagenti did acknowledge the marriage unraveled 
about as suddenly as it took place. ``Carmen and Dennis spoke several 
days ago and mutually agreed (to end the marriage),'' Guagenti said. 
Manley said his client is moving forward. ``I just left him, he's 
going to breakfast, and he's in a very good mood,'' Manley said Tuesday 
from his office in Newport Beach. ``Everything speaks for itself, 
the facts speak for themselves. It is what it is.'' Manley said previously 
that the 26-year-old actress who once starred on ``Baywatch'' exploited 
his client. ``Obviously, anyone that would marry somebody that was 
intoxicated to the point that they couldn't speak or stand had ulterior 
motives of some sort,'' Manley had said. ``I don't retract anything 
that was said last week,'' Manley said Tuesday. ``I'm representing 
my client, Dennis Rodman, and nobody else in this matter. My sole 
interest is Dennis Rodman's well being. ``Sometimes I say or do things 
people don't understand. In the big picture, they will make sense 
or add up. Anything that I have said is for the best interests of 
Dennis Rodman.'' The 37-year-old rebounding champion, sidelined by 
the NBA labor dispute, is ready to play ball again, a development 
that would please his agent no end. ``I can't wait for the lockout 
to be over with so everybody can focus on basketball and not be doing 
these other things,'' Manley said.
