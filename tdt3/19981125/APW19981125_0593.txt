Britain's highest court ruled Wednesday that Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
does not have immunity from arrest, meaning the former Chilean dictator 
must remain under police guard while Spain seeks his extradition on 
charges of murder, torture and genocide. The 3-2 majority decision 
by a five-judge tribunal of the House of Lords, delivered on Pinochet's 
83rd birthday, overturned a High Court ruling that Pinochet's arrest 
was illegal because he had immunity under English law for actions 
taken as a foreign former head of state. The Spanish government and 
Spanish and British prosecutors had appealed the Oct. 28 High Court 
judgment. A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were 
murdered or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew 
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. Crowds of demonstrators outside 
Parliament, many of them victims and relatives of people who disappeared 
during the Pinochet regime, whooped, cheered and waved flags and placards 
after hearing Wednesday's ruling. ``This is a great day of victory 
for Pinochet's thousands of victims,'' said Reedy Brody of the New 
York-based group Human Rights Watch. Pinochet now must appear before 
Bow Street Magistrates' Court in London on Dec. 2, the deadline by 
which Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide whether extradition proceedings 
can go ahead. Pinochet's best hope is that Straw will block the Spanish 
extradition proceedings, which would mean that extradition requests 
lodged by Switzerland, France and other countries also would likely 
fall away. If Straw gives the go-ahead, Pinochet faces a long battle 
through the British courts against extradition. The senior judge on 
the House of Lords tribunal, Lord Justice Gordon Slynn, voted to uphold 
the High Court ruling, along with his colleague, Lord Justice Anthony 
Lloyd. But Lord Justices Donald Nicholls, Leonard Hoffman and Johan 
Steyn all said the general should not be granted the cloak of immunity. 
Key issues in the appeal were whether international law and custom 
_ including trials of Rwanda Hutus and Bosnian Serbs for genocide 
and war crimes, and Britain's 1988 adoption of a U.N. Convention on 
Torture _ override this country's sweeping State Immunity Act passed 
in 1978. Prosecutors' lawyers argued that Pinochet's alleged crimes 
were beyond immunity. Pinochet supporters looked stunned at the judgment, 
which delighted international human rights organizations and many 
Chileans both at home and in exile. The general and his wife, Lucia, 
heard the news _ broadcast live on British television _ in his room 
at the Grovelands Priory, the north London hospital where he had remained 
under police guard awaiting news of his fate. Pinochet underwent back 
surgery Oct. 9 during a regular visit to Britain and was arrested 
Oct. 16 in his bed at another hospital.
