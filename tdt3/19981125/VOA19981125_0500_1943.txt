Iraqi opposition groups say they have been promised strong American 
support for their efforts to overthrow Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. 
The remarks followed talks in London on Tuesday between U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Martin Indyk and representatives of more than a 
dozen Iraqi opposition groups. One opposition leader, Ahmad Chalabi, 
called Washington's pledge of support a very important new development. 
In October, the U.S. Congress approved more than $90 million to back 
anti-Saddam groups. In Washington Tuesday, State Department spokesman 
James Rubin acknowledged a change in Iraqi leadership is far from 
imminent. We think that with time and a step-by-step approach and 
with the obvious fact that Saddam Hussein's regime has been one of 
the most brutal exercises in modern history in that part of the world 
that there are very good reasons that the people of Iraq would want 
to look towards the democratic alternative. Obviously, this is a difficult 
enterprise, and nobody is even suggesting that this is something that's 
going to happen overnight, but we do believe that we should and will 
be supportive of those who are coalescing. That is U.S. State Department 
spokesman James Rubin. The Iraqi opposition groups have also been 
meeting with British officials who are urging them to unite and bring 
Saddam Hussein before an international court for crimes against humanity. 
U.S. officials say they also back that idea and that evidence should 
be gathered on the Iraqi leader's use of chemical weapons.
