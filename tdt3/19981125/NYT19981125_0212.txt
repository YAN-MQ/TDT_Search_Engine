THURSDAY GAMES Steelers (7-4) at Lions (4-7) Comment: The perception 
of Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart: He is not a pocket passer 
and has a hard time reading defenses. Hogwash. The reality: In his 
last four games Stewart has completed 72 percent of his passes and 
owns a 100.5 quarterback rating. He struggled early in the season, 
but recently Stewart has played well, partly because the coaching 
staff has opened up the offense and he is allowed to create on the 
run if nothing is open. The Steelers are feeling extremely confident 
after beating up Jacksonville last week; the only reason the Lions 
will make it a game is running back Barry Sanders. He will get 150 
on the ground alone. Steelers, 24-15 Vikings (10-1) at Cowboys (8-3) 
Comment: Put down the turkey and sink your teeth into this game, which 
could be one of the best of the season. The only thing that puts a 
damper on it is that Vikings wide receiver Jake Reed is out with back 
problems, putting a dent in the great receiving trifecta of Reed, 
Cris Carter and Randy Moss. That just means that Moss, instead of 
150 receiving yards, could get 300. Cowboys' cornerback Deion Sanders, 
a future Hall of Famer, is listed as questionable with a toe injury, 
but if he plays, he would almost certainly be matched up on Moss. 
How's that for a battle? The game will be won, though, in the trenches. 
Tampa Bay gave the rest of the league the game plan on how to beat 
Minnesota: get ahead early, and pound the ball inside against a smallish 
defensive line. Dallas has a huge offensive line and running back 
Emmitt Smith has averaged 97.3 yards rushing in eight Thanksgiving 
Day contests. But that just means that Dallas keeps things close. 
Nothing can really stop this Minnesota offense _ not a short week 
or Reed on the sideline. Vikings, 30-24.
