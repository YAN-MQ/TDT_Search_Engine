Soldiers of the former Rwandan army, many of whom took part in the 
1994 massacres there, are playing a big role in putting down the latest 
rebellion in Congo, a U.N. report says. The involvement of the soldiers, 
mostly Hutu, has long been suspected, even though Congo's President 
Laurent Kabila has denied any association with them. The report says 
that thousands of former soldiers and associated Hutu militiamen have 
converged in Congo and become a ``significant component'' of the drive 
by Kabila and allied African countries to suppress rebels who have 
emerged in eastern Congo, near the border with Rwanda, in an area 
known as the Great Lakes region. It further contends that these former 
soldiers and Hutu militia members have turned to drug trafficking 
to finance the purchase of small arms. ``The situation in the Great 
Lakes region is rapidly heading toward a catastrophe of incalculable 
consequences which requires urgent, comprehensive and decisive measures 
on the part of the international community,'' warns the report, which 
was issued this week. ``The danger of a repetition of tragedy comparable 
to the Rwandan genocide of 1994, but on a subregional scale, cannot 
be ruled out.'' The latest conflict in Congo has been brewing since 
August, when a group of rebels, backed by Uganda and Rwanda, began 
an uprising against Kabila, who himself took power only a year ago. 
The Rwandan government, which is dominated by the Tutsi ethnic group, 
has said that it backed the rebellion largely to secure its borders 
against attacks from the former Hutu soldiers in eastern Congo. Since 
then, the fighting has expanded into a regional conflict, as soldiers 
from Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia have joined forces with Kabila 
against the rebels and their allies. In effect, the report says, the 
former soldiers and the Hutu militias, known as the Interahamwe, have 
gained a ``a form of legitimacy'' because of their ties to Kabila 
and his allies. ``This is a profoundly shocking state of affairs,'' 
it says. These Hutu and others helped carry out the 1994 massacres 
in Rwanda, in which hundreds of thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu 
were killed. A Tutsi rebel force then took power in Rwanda, ending 
the killing and driving more than 1.5 million Hutu out of the country. 
The report says that Hutu soldiers dispersed into countries around 
the region, but have been returning in ever-increasing numbers to 
fight in eastern Congo. There are an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 Hutu 
soldiers in northeastern Congo and another 10,000 in the south, the 
reports claims. Hundreds of Rwandan Hutu were recruited by Kabila's 
government for fighting around Kinshasa, Congo's capital, earlier 
this year. The commission, headed by Mahmoud Kassem of Egypt, has 
investigated the illegal flow arms into the region intermittently 
since 1995, a task made more difficult since the rebellion began. 
Although there is a United Nations embargo on arms sales to the Hutu 
groups, arms are getting through in large numbers and the ``free flow 
of arms into and within Africa is a major long-term cause of insecurity,'' 
the report says. The Hutu have begun paying for the arms by trafficking 
in Mandrax, a sedative used as a recreational drug, the report says. 
The Mandrax is smuggled to Kenya and Tanzania, and then mostly to 
Europe.
