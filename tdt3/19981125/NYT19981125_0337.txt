At first, she did only Shirley Bassey and Cilla Black. To entertain 
her friends on the schoolyard back home in northern England, Jane 
Horrocks would spend her lunch breaks warbling just like the legendary 
British song stylists. As she grew, so did her repertory; eventually 
this character actress, best known in the United States for her flashy 
supporting role as the braying secretary, Bubble, on ``Absolutely 
Fabulous,'' would add the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Edith Piaf, Judy 
Garland and Marilyn Monroe. Most often, it was she who summoned the 
celebrities. Occasionally, though, they'd show up unbidden. ``Once, 
I had a confrontation with a boyfriend and I just metamorphosed into 
Barbra Streisand,'' recalled Ms. Horrocks, who at the time was just 
a scrawny 15-year-old with a headful of tight curls permed to resemble 
Ms. Streisand's Afro from her ``Star Is Born'' period. ``He got furious 
with me. He said, `Stop talking like Barbra Streisand.' But I just 
couldn't.'' In her latest film, ``Little Voice,'' directed and adapted 
for the screen by Mark Herman (``Brassed Off''), Ms. Horrocks plays 
L.V. (for Little Voice), an introverted working-class waif who holes 
up in her bedroom, hoping both to escape the scalding remarks of her 
alcoholic mother (Brenda Blethyn) and to recapture the comforting 
presence of her late father by playing and re-playing the 33 and one-third 
records from his collection of pop classics. For all her mother's 
seedy boyfriend (a gold-chained Michael Caine) knows, L.V. is completely 
mute. Then, as the sounds of famous female pop singers seep from beneath 
her door and out the windows, he discovers that this mousy young woman 
has a gift for impersonating divas. The rest of ``Little Voice,'' 
which opens on Dec. 4, documents his hapless attempts to exploit L.V.'s 
talents _ and also shows a veteran actor being bowled over by his 
younger co-star. ``There's a shot where I'm looking absolutely astounded, 
which was true,'' said Caine, who added that he didn't know he was 
being filmed when the moment was captured. ``I mean, Jane only weighs 
about 20 pounds. You have to wonder, `Where does that voice come from?' 
'' It is no coincidence that ``Little Voice'' appears to be a dream 
showcase for Ms. Horrocks: the movie is based on a play, ``The Rise 
and Fall of Little Voice,'' by Jim Cartwright, an old friend of hers 
who caught Ms. Horrocks' one-person variety show in her back garden 
one afternoon and decided to create a theater piece for her. During 
its 1994 run, the production became one of the hottest tickets in 
London's West End. Some audience members would sing along with Ms. 
Horrocks as she inhabited the identities of Garland, Monroe and Ms. 
Bassey. Neither on screen nor on stage, however, were her disciples 
treated to Ms. Horrocks' pitch-perfect replication of Ms. Streisand. 
``To be honest, I just don't think she fit in with those other women,'' 
said Ms. Horrocks, whose taste for musical impressions runs toward 
the sadder, more broken chanteuses. ``Streisand is so seemingly power-crazed 
at the moment. There's nothing vulnerable about her that I can see.'' 
By contrast, the 5-foot-2-inch Ms. Horrocks is about the most vulnerable 
looking creature you can imagine. She has huge, widely spaced eyes, 
and even though she was wearing red lipstick and a gray cashmere sweater 
set for an interview, she could still have passed for an eighth-grader. 
In fact, she's so slender that despite seeing her polish off a king-size 
breakfast of eggs, bacon and toast, the waiter at the Four Seasons 
Hotel in Beverly Hills couldn't have known she was eating for two: 
Ms. Horrocks is expecting a child in March. She has an 18-month-old 
son, Dylan, at home with Nick Vivian, a screenwriter who is her boyfriend 
and the father of both children. ``Or I think so, anyway,'' Ms. Horrocks 
joked. The youngest child of John Horrocks, an electrical salesman, 
and his wife, Barbara, a hospital ward aide, Ms. Horrocks grew up 
in Rawtenstall, England, where the first person she learned to amuse 
was herself. ``I was a spoiled brat,'' she said. ``My two older brothers 
spent a lot of years not being able to stand me. So I was on my own 
quite a lot, developing this vivid imagination.'' Her Technicolor 
take on things continued to evolve at the Royal Academy of Dramatic 
Arts and, afterward, with the Royal Shakespeare Company. These days, 
it is impossible to select which of Ms. Horrocks' creations is the 
most original. To choose her chocolate-smeared bulimic in Mike Leigh's 
``Life Is Sweet'' (1991) would be to ignore the abrasive new spin 
she gave to Sally Bowles when she originated the role in her former 
boyfriend Sam Mendes' 1994 revisionist ``Cabaret'' in London (currently 
on Broadway, starring Jennifer Jason Leigh). And what about the 1995 
experimental version of ``Macbeth,'' in which Ms. Horrocks showed 
Lady Macbeth's descent into madness every evening by urinating onstage 
before a flabbergasted audience? ``When people lose control, it's 
not pleasant to watch,'' said Ms. Horrocks, in a bit of understatement. 
It was an acting choice the producers asked her to discontinue for 
the show's tour of Scottish schools. In the end, the ``Macbeth'' experience 
made her reflect on which sector of the dramatic arts could support 
her penchant for risk. ``After that, I just sort of lost faith in 
theater,'' she said. In turn, Hollywood, at least briefly, lost faith 
in her. At some point after the film rights to ``The Rise and Fall 
of Little Voice'' were purchased, but before the project went into 
production, Ms. Horrocks was told she was being replaced by the better-known 
Gwyneth Paltrow. ``Oh, she would have been very appropriate,'' Ms. 
Horrocks said, in a half-playful, half-scoffing tone, about the idea 
of casting a blond American goddess over the woman who made the role. 
``I never heard why Gwyneth decided not to do it. Maybe they all decided 
they were being lunatics.'' Or maybe they remembered what happened 
in 1994. That was the year the Steppenwolf company in Chicago tried 
to put on a Horrocks-less rendition of ``The Rise and Fall of Little 
Voice'' at the Neil Simon Theater. ``It closed after a week,'' said 
Ms. Horrocks.
