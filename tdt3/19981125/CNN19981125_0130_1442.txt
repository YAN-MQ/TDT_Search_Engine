Scotch tape, scissors and several spools of patience are needed to 
become the best gift wrapper in town. Jeanne Moos looks at the merging 
of talent and generosity in New York. Two, one, wrap. Imagine trying 
to gift wrap a Hula hoop. What's with all the hoopla? Go, Sarah! Go, 
Sarah! Go, Terry! The average American supposedly wraps about 31 gifts 
a year, but these folks wrap hundreds. The contestants vying for the 
title "most gifted wrapper" all wrap for a Living at places like bloomingdale's 
and Macy's. Take Sharon Devore. Honest to God, you never want to open 
her presents. They're Gorgeous. Sharon's sister was teary-eyed almost 
from the moment the competition began. A dozen contestants had eight 
minutes to wrap the same two items -- a Candlestick and a lego jar 
with a cowboy lid. The candlestick was tricky. But the lego jar was 
murder. All the contestants wore handy tape dispensers on their wrists, 
compliments of the contest sponsor, Scotch brands. You're dancing 
now, baby, go! You'd dance, too, for a $10,000 first prize. Four finalists 
had to jump through hoops trying to figure out how to wrap the Hula 
hoop. The judges conferred and narrowed the field to two. The final 
challenge, try wrapping this. You can do it. Sharon Devore opted for 
the minimalist technique. Teri vigil went all the way. Number one. 
Number one. The winner is a part-time wrapper at a New Jersey Macy's 
store. Sharon Devore. Friends and relatives proceeded to wrap Sharon 
up in their arms. I just can't believe it. What are you gonna do with 
the $10,000? Home renovations. Ask any of these experts what most 
of us do wrong and you'll get the same answer. The wrong size paper. 
You have too much paper. We had the winner critique a panel of three 
admittedly hopeless wrappers. It's a little bit lumpy, John. Yeah. 
John, that's a mess. That's not lumpy, that's a total mess. Number 
one. Go ahead, John. It's stuck. For those of us who can barely wrap 
a taco, these contestants were an inspiration. They can wrap anything, 
and we mean anything. How do I get unwrapped? Jeanne Moos, CNN -- 
I feel like I'm at some bachelor party. -- New York.
