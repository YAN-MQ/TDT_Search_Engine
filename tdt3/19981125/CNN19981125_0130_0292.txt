Consumer confidence apparently is up, just in time for the holiday 
shopping season. The conference board reports that in November, the 
consumer confidence index rose 6.7 points to 126, quite a recovery 
after October, when it fell to its lowest level in nearly two years. 
That could bode well for stores. The holiday shopping season officially 
begins Friday. According to the survey, more Americans say they would 
buy a home or major appliance. And more people expect economic conditions 
to get better, meaning more jobs and higher paychecks.
