Actor Michael J. fox reveals he has been battling Parkinson's disease 
for the past seven years. In an interview with "people" magazine, 
fox says he underwent brain surgery last March to help reduce the 
tremors associated with the disorder. Some people with Parkinson's 
become unable to walk or talk. Fox, who is 37, says he was first diagnosed 
in 1991 when he noticed an unusual twitch in a finger. He says surgery 
eliminated the worst tremors and drug treatment is controlling the 
milder ones.
