Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday canceled a visit to 
Switzerland which had been scheduled to try and defuse tensions over 
a campaign to have Swiss banks pay restitution to Holocaust victims. 
Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute ``because of his 
effort to expand the Cabinet and achieve a stronger base for policy 
measures,'' his office said. Netanyahu spent most of the night from 
Tuesday to Wednesday negotiating the return of his former foreign 
minister, David Levy, in an attempt to shore up his fragile coalition 
government. The prime minister also delayed his departure for Britain 
although he was expected to make the trip late Wednesday. Spain is 
also on his itinerary. A shadow was cast over Netanyahu's trip to 
Switzerland after he participated last week in a ceremony honoring 
Americans and Israelis who had campaigned against Swiss banks. Those 
honored played a key role in winning the agreement of the banks to 
pay dlrs 1.2 billion to Holocaust survivors and the heirs of victims 
to settle claims for assets deposited in the banks during World War 
II. Swiss officials expressed their irritation over the award ceremony 
but did not rescind the invitation to Netanyahu. Even before the cancellation 
was disclosed, the Switzerland-Israel Society, which fosters closer 
ties between the two countries, said relations were at a low point. 
Swiss officials said they expected the Swiss Cabinet to discuss a 
new date for Netanyahu's visit later Wednesday.
