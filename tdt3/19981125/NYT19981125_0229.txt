The attraction of Jeff Taylor's new book, ``Tools of the Earth: The 
Practice and Pleasure of Gardening,'' is that it appears to be a sequel 
to his previous book, ``Tools of the Trade: The Art and Craft of Carpentry,'' 
which told you more than you were likely to know about the hammer, 
the handsaw and other basic tools, and pleasantly less than you wanted 
to know. But although the format of the new book is the same, with 
each of its two-dozen chapters devoted to some basic gardening implement, 
``Tools of the Earth'' is not what it appears to be. Instead of giving 
you the essentials on, say, the shovel, the hoe, the watering can 
and the rake, each chapter careens off in an unexpected direction. 
For instance, in ``Cloche: Glass Houses,'' in addition to suggesting 
ways to build what the author defines as ``a removable womb that is 
placed temporarily over transplants out in the garden,'' he establishes 
that his wife, Joy, is the family member in charge of their garden. 
In ``Garden Trowel: Joy in Mudville,'' Taylor describes how he and 
his wife first met. In ``Secateurs: The Flower People,'' he tells 
how his father ``passed away at home'' and how his rural Oregon community 
celebrated the ``wedding'' of two members ``renewing their vows.'' 
In ``Pitchfork: Savage Garden,'' he explores the difficulties of rearing 
a 13-year-old daughter. And in ``Rake: The Challenge,'' he describes 
the trials of trying to quit smoking. Taylor, a professional carpenter 
and columnist for This Old House magazine, apparently intended his 
new book to be a change of pace, a combination of autobiography and 
Thoreauvian meditation on the gardening seasons in the Pacific Northwest. 
But his approach is not sparklingly original. After all, how much 
more is there to say on the pleasures of resting in a hammock, or 
the spinal wear and tear of shoveling or the therapeutic benefits 
of cultivating your own garden? And the few passages that do seem 
unusual _ like a discussion of the technique of exterminating slugs, 
or a meditation on the pleasures of gardening while naked _ are not 
particularly well written. In fact, it would take an E.B. White to 
write appealingly on such offbeat subjects. It is neither cruel nor 
insulting to say that Taylor is no E.B. White when it comes to this 
particular sort of thing. Precious few writers on rural subjects are. 
Now and then Taylor deviates into offering useful or curious information. 
He seems informative on the art of composting: ``The trick, I believe, 
is complete aeration,'' he writes, ``not a perfect mix of carbon and 
nitrogen.'' He informs us that copper repels slugs. They ``can crawl 
over a razor blade, but not a bucket lip if you wrap some copper wire 
around the top,'' he writes. ``Slugs hate the electric taste of copper, 
and the very sight of a bucket.'' ``Do not cut braided string when 
its taut,'' he warns. ``Six feet of it will come unraveled. Pinch 
a loop between finger and thumb and cut there.'' ``A good hoe should 
slice weeds, like a Ginsu knife,'' he surprisingly tells us. ``This 
means a hoe must be sharp; not just pretty sharp, as with the painted 
bevel-edge you find on hardware-store tools, but incredibly, fantastically, 
molecule-cleaving sharp, the blade first shaped with a file and then 
honed for an hour or so with a whetstone.'' But whatever practical 
advice Taylor has to offer gets overwhelmed by his lamentations over 
what he sees as the deterioration of the environment. His pleasure 
in buying a new motorized tiller is swamped by his guilt over ``adding 
a little more pollution to plague the world.'' His chapter on the 
humble watering can turns into a complaint about declining water resources, 
while his instructions on how to prune trees lapse into an ululation 
over deforestation. ``The future has definitely arrived, and its name 
is Dystopia,'' he mourns, but the inanity of his outlook can be seen 
in his announcement that the period of World War II ``must have been 
an incredible time to be alive'' because ``those years were the last 
time in American history that this nation actively practiced conservation 
of raw materials.'' To which you want to shout back that many people 
found it an incredible time to be alive simply because they were surviving 
it. In the book's opening paragraph, Taylor announces: ``after years, 
now I can grow a tomato. That was my original, my only goal in becoming 
a student of gardening.'' In his final chapter, ``Harvest Basket: 
The Answers of Autumn,'' he complains of having ``too many tomatoes.'' 
He concludes: ``Picking and processing tomatoes was great fun for 
the first few days, when we were fresh. Now it reminds me of school, 
when the hours dripped like ketchup from the bottle and all eyes were 
glued to the clock.'' This excess and poor planning is a measure of 
all that has gone wrong with ``Tools of the Earth.'' PUBLICATION NOTES:
