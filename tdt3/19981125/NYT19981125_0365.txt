The soldiers were not really soldiers at all, but old men and boys 
and others who were considered unfit for a real Confederate uniform, 
armed with squirrel rifles and shotguns and smooth-bore muskets that 
hurled a musket ball in the rough direction of the enemy. Their commanding 
general had no real experience in battle, and it was rumored that 
what courage he had came from a bottle of bourbon. Their ragtag regiment 
was called the Georgia Militia, but the real Confederate regulars, 
half-starved, their ranks shot to pieces at this late date in the 
Civil War, referred to them derisively as ``Joe Brown's Pets.'' Gov. 
Joe Brown, who had formed them as a home guard, never let them fight 
outside Georgia, say Civil War historians, so the regulars questioned 
their courage. History probably would have remembered them that way, 
too, or not at all, if the hated Union general, William Tecumseh Sherman, 
had not put a match to the little hamlet of Griswoldville, Ga., 10 
miles east of Macon, on Nov. 22, 1864. What happened next would go 
down as one of the most courageous actions of the war, but one of 
its most tragic, one-sided and _ many historians believe _ foolish. 
``It was never intended to even be a battle,'' said Bill Scaife, a 
Civil War historian from Ackworth, Ga. But that is no reason, historians 
and history buffs here agree, that the fields and trees should be 
paved over with subdivisions and forgotten. Last week, the State of 
Georgia dedicated 17 acres of battlefield _ virtually unchanged since 
that violent day _ to the Georgia State Parks, which will maintain 
the land as a historic site. A church had already been built on a 
corner of the battlefield, and encroaching development threatened 
to swallow the site until history buffs and others raised much of 
the $95,000 needed to purchase the land and give it to the state for 
preservation. Georgia has preserved several battlefields, said Billy 
Townsend, chief historian for the park system, but none that honors 
the kind of soldier who died here. As a battle, historians say, it 
was barely a pause in Sherman's March to the Sea, but as a tragedy, 
it was historic. Of the some 2,000 militia, 500 died, charging again 
and again and again across the fields, and the blood was smeared for 
acres against an unusual late November snow, surviving soldiers wrote. 
``Although the Confederates showed a lot of courage, they did not 
not show a lot of intelligence,'' said Scaife, who has written several 
Civil War books and is working on one that will include the Griswoldville 
battle. To understand it, historians say, one must understand a Georgian's 
hatred of Sherman, who burned and pillaged the state, intending to 
cleave the South in half and crush its armies and spirit. He has been 
referred to here, said Townsend, ``as the first modern war criminal.'' 
Scaife said, ``We felt toward him the way we feel about Hitler today.'' 
It was this man's army, an army that had just burned and sacked Atlanta 
and was now marching on Savannah, that fell on the tiny town of Griswoldville 
and burned it to the ground. The militia was not even supposed to 
encounter Sherman's army, and was marching to help reinforce Augusta, 
north of Savannah, when it collided with the veteran Union soldiers. 
Members of the militia, who had orders not to engage their enemy because 
they were outnumbered by thousands, stared at them across the field. 
Many had seen their homes burned to the ground by Sherman's troops. 
Others had lived here, in Griswoldville. ``They could smell the burning 
buildings,'' Townsend said. They itched to fight, some historians 
say. To strike back at the Yankees would have elevated them in the 
eyes of other soldiers. But they never would have stormed across those 
open fields if they had not had orders to do so, and it is one of 
the great mysteries of the war that, against all common sense and 
decency, that order was given. Scaife said the commander of the militia, 
Gen. G.W. Smith, ``had the habit of finding some excuse not to lead 
troops into battle.'' Instead, he appointed a younger, less-experienced 
general, Pleasant J. Phillips, to lead the march. ``He was the least-experienced 
of the commanders,'' Scaife said, in a militia officer corps that 
was mostly made up of political appointees. He also had a reputation 
for drinking too much, ``but in fairness to his descendants, I don't 
know about that,'' Scaife said. ``But whether he was drunk or not, 
he did not command with any degree of competence.'' Phillips ordered 
his militia to charge the enemy across open ground. ``These were the 
pick of Sherman's veterans,'' armed with weapons that could fire as 
fast as the soldier could work the lever of his repeating rifle, Scaife 
said. It was slaughter. Phillips ordered them to charge again, and 
they were slaughtered again. They charged seven times, until one in 
four men, almost, was dead. The militia was not so much as defeated 
as it was exhausted, used up. ``Part of it was anger,'' that kept 
the men throwing themselves against the rifles of their enemies, Townsend 
said. Their courage cost the Union forces just 90 men, historians 
say. It was the only infantry battle actually fought by the opposing 
forces on Georgia soil. The other confrontations were sieges. The 
war was pretty much lost already. Sherman did march to the sea. ``It 
was courageous,'' said Scaife, ``but it was tragic.''
