Conspicuous consumption may be off a little this year, much like many 
a Wall Street bonus, but a bit of luxury and indulgence is definitely 
still in style. And for those on smaller budgets, the appearance of 
luxury _ in, say, fake fur trims and gold- and silver-colored candles, 
handbags and champagne flutes _ works just as well. America's Research 
Group predicts that 40 percent of consumers will spend more this year. 
With forecasts like that and consumer confidence on an upswing, ``there's 
nothing to suggest the holiday is going to be a bust,'' said John 
Konarski, director of research for the International Council of Shopping 
Centers, which tracks shopping trends. Whatever the budget, when it 
comes to holiday shopping, emotion takes over. In the luxury corner, 
white gold, platinum and silver are popular, turning up in everything 
from cross pendants to Edwardian and Victorian designs inspired by 
the movie ``Titanic.'' Watches, long a gift staple, feature dials 
with colors like gunmetal gray, salmon or mother of pearl, and bracelet 
versions. Exotic travel locales, though, might bring to mind Indiana 
Jones more than James Bond. ``People are looking for experiences,'' 
said Arnold Brown, chairman of Weiner, Edrich, Brown Inc., a New York 
firm that helps business analyze change. Holiday vacations this year, 
he says, are as likely to focus on the self-indulgent luxury of a 
spa or cruise as on an educational trip such as an ecology tour or 
whale watching. Low-end computers, priced under $1,000, will make 
their way into the homes of many shoppers, from retirees and other 
first-time buyers to families adding a model exclusively for the children. 
Recent price cuts are also expected to help computer and video games 
and cell phones disappear from store shelves, along with hand-held 
computer devices. The trend in apparel leans toward the casual. Fleece 
pullovers, the brighter the better, are flying off the shelves, said 
Thomas Burns, senior vice president at the Doneger Group, retail consultants 
based in New York. In women's clothing, cashmere is generally expected 
to sell well, with many sweaters offered for $20 to $30 and up. But 
analysts expect consumers to balk at the lowest-priced, thinnest versions. 
Velvet and suede are also popular choices to add a hint of luxury. 
Then there are the gifts you can never go wrong with: books. But move 
over, Martha Stewart; Oprah Winfrey reigns here. Though cookbooks 
have long been a gift staple, this year mystery, suspense and self-improvement 
are hot. And anything Ms. Winfrey picks for her television book club 
is an instant best seller. ``If you go into a Barnes &AMP; Noble, 
they have a section that says `Oprah's Picks,''' Konarski said. People 
believe that ``if Oprah says it's good, it must be good.'' And whether 
shoppers want them or not, scented soap and candles will be inescapable. 
These days, few stores fail to carry them, in all shapes, sizes and 
colors. Candles also offer a New Age twist. As 1999 brings the eve 
of a millennium, a religious or mystical influence will be felt everywhere 
from candles to jewelry and books to music. Convenience is gaining 
converts as Internet shopping continues to grow, lifted by a broadening 
array of products available by computer. ``For the last 15 years, 
I've done all my shopping from my chair,'' whether by catalog or Internet, 
Brown admitted. ``You have the list of all the people you're shopping 
for, and bang, bang, bang, you do all the shopping.''
