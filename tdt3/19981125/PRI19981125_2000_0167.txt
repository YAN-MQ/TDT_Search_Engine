Americans continued to outspend their incomes in October, according 
to the Commerce Department. Steve Beckner of Market News International 
reports. Personal income rose 4/10ths of a percent last month driven 
by higher wages and salaries. The personal consumption expenditures 
were up 5/10ths. This meant that for the second straight month, savings 
were negative, a situation last seen in the 1930s. Part of this dissavings 
is a statistical mirage and reflects the removal of capital gains 
on mutual funds from savings as officially defined. Even so, savings 
are low, making some analysts question how long consumption can continue 
at its recent pace. Consumption accounts for two-thirds of economic 
activity and was a big reason why real gross domestic product grew 
nearly four percent in the third quarter. The latest numbers suggest 
little slowing of the spending pace in the first month of the fourth 
quarter. For NPR News, I'm Steve Beckner.
