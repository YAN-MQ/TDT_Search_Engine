One of the doctors treating baseball legend Joe DiMaggio confirms 
the hall of famer had a cancerous tumor removed from his lung last 
month. The doctor told the associated press DiMaggio's prognosis is 
good. He said nothing about Dimaggio suffering a heart attack. A lawyer 
for the former Yankee denies those reports. DiMaggio turns 84 today. 
Although he's still in a Florida hospital, he's celebrating with his 
grandchildren and great grandchildren.
