Turkey seems to be easing its demand that Italy hand over the Kurdish 
rebel leader to face trial in Turkey. Amberin Zeman in Ankara reports 
a government spokesman says Turkey would be satisfied if the Kurdish 
leader were put on trial in another country. Turkey and Italy have 
been embroiled in a diplomatic dispute because Italy is refusing to 
extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. Turkish authorities 
say the Kurdish leader is responsible for the deaths of nearly 30,000 
people. Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the separatist group known as the 
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, was arrested more than two weeks 
ago as he arrived in Rome after a flight from Moscow. But Italy rejected 
Turkey's extradition demands because Italian law forbids extradition 
to a country with a death penalty. Turkish government spokesman Mahad 
Addejohn said that ideally Turkey wants Abdullah Ocalan to face trial 
in Turkey where he is wanted on treason charges, but the spokesman 
said that, if this did not happen, Turkey would be satisfied if the 
PKK leader is put on trial for terrorism in a third country. Amberin 
Zeman for VOA News, Ankara.
