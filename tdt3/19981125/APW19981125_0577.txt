CERKLJE, Slovenia (AP) _ NATO choppers flew overhead and Italian doctors 
cared for the supposedly wounded Wednesday, as the first NATO maneuvers 
to be held in this former Yugoslav country were in full swing. More 
than 5,500 troops from the eight member countries of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization and 10 nations of the Alliance's Partnership for 
Peace program are participating in the operation, code-named Exercise 
Cooperative Adventure Exchange 1998. The maneuvers are primarily intended 
to ``conduct peace support operations _ this is not a war operation,'' 
said Gen. Maj. Vito Carlucci, chief of staff of NATO Allied land forces 
southern Europe. Carlucci added that the mock-scenarios are based 
``in real incidents that happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia,'' 
where NATO troops have already been deployed. He said the troops have 
been rehearsing different scenarios, from the deployment of NATO troops 
in the fiction country where an ethnic conflict ended with a cease-fire 
to the release of prisoners from the detention camp. They also were 
trained to search for an assassin who shot a political leader at the 
rally. NATO has earlier rejected speculations that the exercise was 
related to efforts to contain the conflict in Kosovo, Yugoslavia's 
restive southern province, where the United States and its allies 
are seeking to mediate talks for a peaceful solution. The exercise 
consisted of mock-incidents such as a Lithuanian field hospital, where 
doctors from Germany and Denmark practiced treating wounded soldiers. 
Another example involved three trucks _ American, British and Danish 
_ that recovered a military tank that went off on the road. Slovenia, 
which declared independence from the former Yugoslav federation in 
1991, became a member of the Partnership for Peace program in 1995 
. The country of two million is also listed as a contender in NATO's 
envisaged enlargement. Up to 1,200 Slovene soldiers are participating 
in the exercise. The exercise was closed to the public, but reporters 
were invited to see the part of it on Wednesday.
