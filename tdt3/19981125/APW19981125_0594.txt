President Nelson Mandela on Thursday planned to present the head of 
soccer's world governing body FIFA with its highest honary award for 
foreigners, a presidential spokeswoman said Wednesday. Joseph S. Blatter 
will receive the Order of Good Hope at Mandela's private home in Houghton, 
a plush suburb of the country's biggest city, Johannesburg, said Priscilla 
Naidoo. South Africa is keen to host the 2006 soccer World Cup and 
Blatter is on record supporting the bid _ provided facilities are 
up to par. After losing out on a bid for the 2004 Olympics, South 
Africa wants to host the largest sporting event in the world and further 
mark an end to apartheid times when the country was barred from international 
competition. South Africa has already held the 1995 rugby World Cup, 
1996 Africa Cup of Nations and 1998 athletics World Cup.
