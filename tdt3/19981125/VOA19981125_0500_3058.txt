The U.S. government says growth in the third quarter totaled 3.9 percent, 
much better than the original figure of 3.3 percent issued last month. 
Kevin Flanagan, money market economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
was asked if there will be a split-over effect in the fourth quarter. 
Well, I would not expect to see this type of performance duplicated 
for the October-December period. Odds favor you will see the net export 
component go back into the negative territory, so I would imagine 
something more in the lines of 3 percent or below for the fourth quarter, 
and that's extraordinarily preliminary. The government says corporate 
profits declined in the third quarter, falling 1.8 percent after a.6-percent 
rise in the second. They expect such corporate profits to decline 
further next year.
