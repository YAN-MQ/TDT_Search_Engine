Prosecutors in Michigan have charged Dr. Jack Kevorkian with first 
degree murder. He's been acquitted of helping suicides in three previous 
trials, but a video screened on national television shows him for 
the first time directly administering a lethal injection. THE WORLD's 
David Lavalle has more. Michigan's Oakland County prosecutors, David 
Gorsica, says he and police officials today viewed the unedited videotape 
of an assisted suicide, excerpts of which were shown on CBS' program, 
"60 Minutes." The tape shows Kevorkian euthanizing a terminally ill 
man in his home three weeks after Michigan made assisted suicide illegal. 
Using the tape as evidence, the prosecutors has now charged Dr. Kevorkian 
with first degree murder, killing a patient with a poisonous substance. 
Kevorkian is now expected to turn himself in for arraignment. For 
THE WORLD, I'm David Lavalle.
