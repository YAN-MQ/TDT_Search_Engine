A white teacher in New York has been removed from her third grade 
class for giving her mostly black students a book called, "nappy hair." 
Outraged parents screamed and threatened her at a school meeting, 
saying the book makes derogatory remarks about black people. The author, 
who is black, says the notion her critically acclaimed book is racist 
is ridiculous. She says "nappy hair" celebrates racial diversity. 
The school board hasn't decided what disciplinary action, if any, 
will be taken.
