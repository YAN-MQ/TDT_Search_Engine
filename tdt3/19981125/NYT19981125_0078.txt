Never has the good old Model United Nations, popular for so long among 
the earnest high school set, seemed so pallid, so retro, so (to be 
read with teen-age disdain) 20th century. Last week, 100 youngsters 
from 10 to 16 years old from around the world attended a global forum 
at the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
The forum, called the Junior Summit, is to the quaint old Mock United 
Nations what a personal computer is to an abacus. Connected online 
for months before they arrived for the summit, equipped with pagers 
with e-mail functions and Power Point presentation skills, the participants 
in the summit did not jabber about treaties and points of order. They 
simply plotted to change the world, using technology. They planned 
to create an online country, to be known as Nation1, where anyone 
under 19 could automatically become a citizen. Adults would need a 
visa, or special permission, to enter. They hashed out the idea for 
Kidz Bank, an online bank for children's savings that could lend them 
money for worthwhile projects, and how to develop a digital currency. 
And they founded an online global newspaper for children. They did 
not shoot low. ``By the year 2000, our global network shall comprise 
around 2 million people,'' Steven James Sutton, a 15-year-old from 
New Zealand, announced in ringing Churchillian tones on Friday as 
he rehearsed for a presentation before a gathering of diplomats, World 
Bank officials, corporate sponsors and assorted dignitaries. ``We 
will have a network of school groups all across the world,'' Sutton 
declared. ``We will have international events. We will have everyone 
planting trees on Earth Day.'' Adults tempted to shake their heads 
in amusement and joke about the days when 30 years was the cut-off 
point for people who could be trusted, instead of 19, might do well 
to note: These children are backed by almost unlimited computer power 
from MIT, as well as millions of dollars from a Japanese magnate. 
Isao Okawa, chairman of CSK Corp., which makes business software, 
and Sega Enterprises Ltd., the game-maker, has agreed to contribute 
$27 million to build a ``Center for Future Children'' next door to 
the current Media Lab building. The donation, MIT said, is one of 
the largest the university has received and is believed to be the 
biggest ever made by a Japanese individual to a foreign institution. 
It means a major expansion for the Media Lab, already known for its 
success in winning corporate sponsors. The lab's projects tend to 
focus on the intersection between technology and people, and range 
from wearable computers to electronic books. In 1995, Okawa was attending 
a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized countries when it struck 
him that though children have the biggest stake in the future, they 
have almost no say in determining it, said Mitchel Resnick, the Media 
Lab professor who is overseeing development of the center's programs. 
The center will try ``to rethink how children live, learn and play,'' 
Resnick said. He added: ``We want to rethink technology to make it 
worthy of children of the future. The kids you see here today could 
do so much more technologically if we gave them the right tools.'' 
And with those tools, the thinking goes, childhood itself would change, 
as children became ever more able to take on new roles. For example, 
becoming founders of banks and newspapers _ and nations. ``I don't 
know whether it's a pipe-dream or not, but I think we're going to 
do this,'' said John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, which advocates freedom on the Internet, and adviser to 
the group of youths working on the Nation1 project. ``I've never started 
a nation before, especially in three days.'' But the children have 
begun to show, he said, ``how they can start assembling, marshaling 
and deploying resources in a way that I think will scare the hell 
out of adults.'' Actually, most of the youngsters' plans would gladden 
adults' hearts: reducing child labor, improving the environment, helping 
disabled children and simplifying computing. Now, will adults listen? 
``There will be those who say, `That's cute, nice to hear your voice,' 
and go back to what they're doing,'' said Terah DeJong, 15, of India. 
But some at the global forum formed fast friendships, he said, ``and 
we expect to continue on for years.'' NYT-11-21-98 1539EST
