More than 70 Protestant ``house church'' leaders remain in detention 
after a crackdown on illegal church activities in late October and 
early November, a human rights group said Wednesday. One woman, it 
said, was beaten so badly in jail that she suffered brain injuries. 
The crackdown occurred in the central province of Henan, where underground 
Protestant leaders from around the country were meeting. China allows 
worship in an official Protestant church that accepts the leadership 
of the government, but tens of millions of Chinese are believed to 
have become involved in so-called house churches that operate illegally. 
The injured woman, Cheng Meiying, had traveled to the meetings from 
northeastern China where she was a successful missionary, establishing 
many new house churches, according to the statement from the New York-based 
group Human Rights in China. The statement, based on information passed 
abroad by house-church followers, said Ms. Cheng had repeatedly been 
beaten while in detention and lost consciousness for three days. She 
was released on Saturday but suffers memory loss and severe disorientation, 
the statement said. Another church leader, Li Qingrui, was shot in 
the thigh while fleeing the police, the statement said. After receiving 
hospital care he escaped and is now the object of a national manhunt, 
it said.
