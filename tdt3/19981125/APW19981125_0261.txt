Emergency measures are needed to save Russia's people from the ravages 
of the country's economic collapse, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
said Wednesday. However, Primakov, speaking at the Ministry of Emergency 
Situations, went on to insist that the country was not in a state 
of emergency. He said the economy had no problems that couldn't be 
fixed with help from the state. ``We can't go on waiting for the market 
environment to solve our problems,'' the prime minister said, according 
to the Interfax news agency. ``In such a difficult transition, development 
must progress along a mechanism worked out in advance.'' The remarks 
were consistent with Primakov's previous statements regarding the 
role of government in steering the economy. The extent of that role 
should become clearer Thursday, when Primakov promised that the government 
would agree on a long-awaited 1999 budget. So far, Primakov's Cabinet 
has been unable to settle on a budget, and has apparently been divided 
among three rival versions of the plan. The prime minister's remarks 
about the country needing emergency measures were presumably meant 
to offer support to the Emergency Situations Ministry, which carries 
out relief missions throughout the country. He said the 1999 budget 
would be extremely strained, and would require emergency measures, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said. He apparently didn't specify the measures. 
Primakov did say a new federal rescue service should be established 
in 2005, ITAR-Tass said. And he called on the Emergency Situations 
Ministry to improve its civil defense preparedness in light of the 
potential for regional conflicts in Russia. Also Wednesday, Deputy 
Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov was quoted as saying that the first 
stage of debt restructuring talks between Russia and the London Club 
of creditors was nearing an end. The talks began Monday in London. 
The government is trying to persuade creditors to restructure a portion 
of the Paris and London Club debts that is inherited from the Soviet 
Union.
