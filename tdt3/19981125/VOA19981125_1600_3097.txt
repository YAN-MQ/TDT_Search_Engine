South Korea plans to list its state-run Korea telecom on the Korea 
Stock Exchange next month. Bloomberg Business News reports the move 
paves the way for a $1.5-billion stock sale overseas by the nation's 
biggest phone company. The government needs to sell shares in state 
monopolies in order to raise money to cushion mounting unemployment 
amid falling tax revenue. Korea is in the middle of its most severe 
recession in decades, and the jobless rate tripled to 7.3 percent 
in September.
