A senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research 
in Boulder, Colorado, says the unusually early, bitter cold snap in 
Europe has nothing to do with climate change, nor can it be blamed 
on the weather pattern called El Nino. Tom Wigley says it would not 
be unusual for colder-than-normal winters to occur in the northern 
hemisphere for several years in a row. The time to worry, he says, 
is 30 or 50 years from now when, he says, the winters in Europe will 
become warmer and shorter. That will be a sure sign, he says, that 
global warming, a product of the greenhouse effect, is reaching a 
critical point. The atmospheric scientist says it will not happen 
quickly, and there may be changes in the other directions before the 
weather gets any warmer.
