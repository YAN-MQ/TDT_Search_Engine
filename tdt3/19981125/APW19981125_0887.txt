The United Nations will bring new inspection teams to Iraq within 
days to carry out searches, a U.N. spokeswoman said Wednesday, in 
what will likely pose a major test to Iraq's promise to cooperate 
with U.N. inspectors. U.N. teams have carried out more than a week 
of visits since Iraq relented Nov. 14 and allowed them to resume their 
work after a two-week hiatus. So far, Iraq has fully cooperated with 
the searches. But most of those visits were to sites that monitors 
had already checked and usually involved maintenance work on long-term 
monitoring equipment. The real test will likely come during searches 
of new sites by the visiting teams of weapons experts. Caroline Cross, 
a U.N. spokeswoman for the weapons inspectors in Baghdad, said the 
teams should arrive this week. ``We do not know when the visiting 
teams will arrive but they should be coming to carry out the inspections 
in the next few days,'' Cross told The Associated Press. Over the 
past week, a new dispute seemed to be emerging over the demand by 
Richard Butler, the chief weapons inspector, for documents on Iraq's 
weapons program. Iraq refused the request, saying many were already 
destroyed. Other documents, like personal diaries, were either irrelevant 
or had already been viewed by inspectors, it said. Although the United 
States and Britain have said their forces in the Gulf could still 
attack Iraq over the dispute, they seem willing to wait to see how 
much help Iraq provides in the coming weeks. The inspectors must certify 
that Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles, chemical, biological 
and nuclear weapons and programs to build them before the Security 
Council will lift crippling sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait 
in 1990. Inspectors blame Iraq's lack of cooperation for the long 
tenure of their work. But Iraq believes the inspections are used as 
an excuse to prolong the sanctions, which have impoverished the country. 
Often, official media blame Butler personally. Butler looks for ``a 
new excuse to be used by the United States and Britain in order to 
trigger a new aggression against Iraq,'' said Al-Thawra, the newspaper 
of the ruling Baath Party. ``It seems that his part is confined to 
creating a new crisis, no more,'' the newspaper said in an editorial 
Wednesday. But the crisis atmosphere in Iraq has largely subsided. 
Officials have toned down their angry rhetoric, and attacks in the 
official media have diminished somewhat in recent days. The one exception 
is the Iraqi opposition, which was vilified by a government spokesman 
Wednesday. The spokesman accused them of ``selling their national 
honor'' to U.S. and British intelligence. Iraqi opposition groups, 
riven by ethnic, religious and political differences, have sought 
to close their ranks in meetings this week with the support of the 
United States and Britain. The spokesman said the two countries are 
``under wishful thinking and pursuing the impossible'' if they try 
to topple Saddam Hussein.
