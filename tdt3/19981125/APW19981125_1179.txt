BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO secretary general Javier Solana goes 
to Macedonia Thursday to press officials there to accept an allied 
force that will be prepared to evacuate, if necessary, civilians monitoring 
a peace deal in neighboring Kosovo. Gen. Klaus Naumann, the German 
who currently heads the panel of military chiefs from the 16 NATO 
nations, said that, pending final agreement from Macedonia, the troops 
should be in place in Macedonia by the end of next week. Britain, 
France, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain are expected to provide 
troops, who are to pull the monitors from Kosovo if they run into 
unexpected physical danger. Under an Oct. 12 deal struck between U.S. 
negotiator Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, 
some 2,000 monitors are being sent to the southern Serbian province 
to ensure Milosevic ends his crackdown there on separatist Albanians 
and withdraws troops and special police forces.
