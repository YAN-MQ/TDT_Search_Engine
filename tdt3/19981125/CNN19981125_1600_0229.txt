Cold weather in Europe is blamed for 90 deaths. Authorities say frigid 
Arctic air has led to 30 deaths in Romania, 47 in poland, and the 
rest in France, Bulgaria and Italy. Many of the victims are middle-aged 
men who drank themselves into a stupor and collapsed outside in the 
cold. Police say one-third of the deaths in Poland have been among 
the homeless.
