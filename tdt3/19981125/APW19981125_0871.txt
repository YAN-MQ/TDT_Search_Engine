A woman claims in a dlrs 10 million lawsuit that she was raped by 
WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya 2 1/2 years ago when she 
was 15 years old, a television station reported. The lawsuit, filed 
late Tuesday in San Bernardino County Superior Court, alleges De La 
Hoya raped the woman in a hotel room in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in 
June 1996. The complaint alleges false imprisonment, sexual battery 
and assault. ``My client has suffered severe psychological injury 
since this incident, which has affected her greatly both emotionally 
and physically,'' said Lisa Maki, attorney for the plaintiff identified 
only as Jane Doe, a U.S. citizen. De La Hoya's lawyer, Martin Castillo, 
told KABC-TV that ``the charges are false and we are looking forward 
to litigating the matter in a court of law. ... We believe (the charges) 
are financially motivated.'' The plaintiff, who is now 18, waited 
more than two years to sue De La Hoya because ``she was terrified, 
and due to her psychological injury we decided to wait to file the 
case when she turned 18,'' Maki said. Phone messages left for Castillo 
and Maki were not returned late Tuesday after business hours. The 
25-year-old De La Hoya (29-0, with 24 knockouts) is scheduled to defend 
the title against Ike Quartey of Ghana Feb. 13 at Las Vegas. The fight 
was scheduled for Nov. 21, but it was postponed when De La Hoya was 
cut while sparring.
