Well here's another number with a lot more meaning. 84. Today is Joe 
DiMaggio's 84th birthday. And the hall of famer got some good news. 
His health is improving, and he could be removed from intensive care 
by the end of the day. For the first time, doctors confirmed that 
DiMaggio did have a cancerous tumor removed from his right lung.
