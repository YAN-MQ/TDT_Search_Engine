We Americans continue to spend more than we earn. That's just the 
reverse from Japan where the government is encouraging people to shop 
rather than save. From our business desk in New York, Liz George has 
been examining the effects the two countries spending habits are having 
on their economic fortunes. For the second month in a row, spending 
has outstripped incomes here. The savings rate, the amount of dollars 
left after tax and spending was a negative figure of minus naught.2 
percent in October. But it's this appetite for spending that's behind 
the surprisingly strong growth here. By contrast, in Japan, a country's 
that struggling to cope with its deepest recession since 1945, consumer 
save over 14 percent of their incomes, and the government resorted 
to giving away shopping vouchers. Hachami Azaki is the U.S. correspondent 
for "Kyoto News." One measure is to give the people voucher for about 
$300 per person over 15 years old. So that would encourage them to 
spend. Is it enough? I don't think so. First of all, the voucher is 
just a onetime measure, and if it leads to more spending, it's a very 
big question. Second, the confidence of the consumer toward the future 
has not changed, so I don't think that in the short term, it will 
help a lot. So when you actually came to the U.S. and you saw the 
people in the U.S. spend dramatic amounts of money every month, and 
in fact spend more than they earn, what was your reaction to that? 
I'm a little bit envious by their behavior. But a little bit worried 
that what - They are thinking of their future in say five, ten years 
now. And economists are still divided over whether such high spending 
levels are prudent. After all, the only time U.S. consumer spending 
followed a similar pattern was during the Depression years of 1932 
and '33. For THE WORLD, I'm Liz George in New York.
