Rebels in Congo Kinshasa have acknowledged that Zimbabwean warplanes 
bombed their positions in the east of the country. Zimbabwe is among 
other nations in the area supporting the Congolese government in its 
fight against the rebels. The insurgents say planes bombed the town 
of Kalemie, but they say the situation on the ground still favors 
the rebels. Zimbabwe says allied aircraft struck targets near the 
City of Kalemie and Lake Tanganyika on Saturday and Sunday.
