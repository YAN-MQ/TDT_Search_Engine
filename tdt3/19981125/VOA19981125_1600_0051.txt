I'm Dave DeForest, VOA News. Britain's highest court has ruled former 
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from prosecution 
for crimes when he was head of state. The British government now has 
one week to decide whether to grant Spain's request for his extradition. 
The former general, who turned 83 Wednesday, was arrested last month 
in London on a Spanish warrant alleging genocide and torture during 
his 17-year rule. Meanwhile, the Chilean government says it will continue 
to fight against Mr. Pinochet's extradition to Spain. More from VOA`s 
Laurie Kassman in London. Chileans, exiles, and victims of Mr. Pinochet's 
government are celebrating the ruling against the former Chilean general. 
But Ambassador Mario Artesa says his government will fight the extradition 
request. We are conscious that this case presented to the government 
was a situation where it took a course of action to be unpopular. 
We decided a long time ago that it was much greater to be unpopular 
than to be wrong. The ambassador says he will deliver an official 
message to the British home office. Chile's foreign minister will 
visit London and Madrid soon to present his government's point of 
view on the extradition case. A Spanish warrant requested Mr. Pinochet's 
arrest and extradition to face charges of human rights abuses during 
his 17-year rule in Chile. Laurie Kassman, VOA News, London.
