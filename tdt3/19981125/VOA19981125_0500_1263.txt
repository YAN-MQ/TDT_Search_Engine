The National Basketball Association has informed the NBC television 
network that its planned Christmas Day doubleheader is the latest 
casualty of the player lockout. NBC had scheduled two games for Christmas 
Day, the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles 
Lakers against the Phoenix Suns. The next full negotiating session 
between the NBA owners and players is planned for Saturday.
