Now to the view through the windshield and something that might have 
occurred to you, the millions of Americans on the road this weekend 
are contending more than the usual traffic tie-UPS. There is another 
threat out there that has now become particularly evident this year.

ever before with debris, everything from car parts to construction 
materials to cargo from trucks. As Kerry Sanders reports, it can have 
deadly consequences. This 10-pound piece of metal fell off the back 
of the truck. Another car hit it, throwing it in the air, causing 
it to Pierce the windshield of a car on a New York highway, killing 
the driver, known for works such as "to kill a mocking bird." Across 
America, road debris, fenders, tires, hunks of metal scattered across 
the roadway. Commercial bread trays. A safety cone. All are hazards 
causing deadly accidents. Six children killed in this Van in Milwaukee 
when a trucker's metal mud flap bounced under the Van, puncturing 
the gas tank and causing an explosion. Here in Florida last year, 
789 road debris accidentings, causing nine deaths. Overcall, the federal 
government says debris played a factor in 51 fatal highway accidents 
last year, but they suspect far more of these cases go unreported.
