The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 29: A British 
appeals court Wednesday greatly bolstered the possibility that Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet of Chile will face justice _ a quarter-century after 
most of the crimes of his military coup. The 3-2 decision that Pinochet's 
status as a former head of state does not give him immunity in Britain 
makes it likely that British courts will agree to Spain's request 
for his extradition. The decision will rest in the hands of Home Secretary 
Jack Straw. Unless Pinochet's health worsens drastically, Straw must 
resist the temptation to decide that he is too frail to stand trial. 
The law lords, a panel of the House of Lords that serves as Britain's 
top court, ruled that the charges against Pinochet, including torture 
and hostage-taking, cannot be considered official functions and therefore 
the immunity normally granted to a former head of state does not apply. 
The decision settles the most important legal issue involved in Spain's 
extradition request. Britain almost always complies with requests 
from European nations and requires little examination of the factual 
evidence of the case. Straw must not heed the false argument that 
trying Pinochet would imperil Chile's democracy. His extremist supporters 
are noisy but few. Chile's military and business leaders know that 
the economic growth and respect they enjoy would vanish if democracy 
fell. Straw should let British justice, and then possibly Spanish 
justice, take its course.
