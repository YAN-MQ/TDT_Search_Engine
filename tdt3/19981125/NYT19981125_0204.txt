Shortly after the birth of Chris Shows' first child in a Monroe, La., 
hospital earlier this month, he got a call from his brother in Austin, 
Texas. ``I've seen her,'' Shows recalled him saying. And, although 
William Shows couldn't pick the baby up, ``He ran right out and got 
a print out.'' With relatives scattered from Texas to the Air Force 
Academy in Colorado to an off-shore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, 
Chris and Cherie Shows had no qualms about letting a picture of their 
infant daughter, Courteney Annmarie, be put on line at the ``virtual 
nursery'' set up by the St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe. Within 
hours of her birth, there she was, eyes still closed, pink and fresh, 
as, well, a newborn baby. While anyone with a digital camera (or a 
standard photograph and scanner), a moderate amount of web knowledge 
and the wherewithal to see it through could put their own newborns 
on line for all to see, hospitals are making easier by giving new 
parents the option of posting their babies' photographs within hours 
of birth. ``The birth of a baby is probably the only health care delivery 
service that people look forward to,'' said Bob Hammack, director 
of marketing at St. Francis (www.stfran.com). ``People want to share 
it.'' And share it they have, going as far as giving birth live on 
the Internet. Still, putting infants on line raises questions about 
protecting the privacy of families, and safeguarding the security 
of hospitals. To get around such issues, most hospitals that put babies 
on line do not use their last names. And some try to time the posting 
of the picture with the release of mother and baby. ``We've never 
had any problems whatsoever,'' said Sandra Nalley, a marketing specialist 
who helped develop the St. Francis online nursery. In fact, Ms. Nalley 
was pregnant when she started the project, and her baby was the first 
to be placed in the hospital's virtual nursery. ``There's no way for 
somebody to put together a name and address,'' she said. On a few 
occasions, she said, when a baby identification bracelet could be 
seen in a picture, the hospital used software allowing it to blur 
that part of the picture. To many hospital, offering the ``virtual 
nursery'' shots is just a natural extension of the basic photo packages 
that have long been available to parents. ``The birth of a child is 
a very important time to forge a relationship,'' said Richard Slack, 
vice president of corporate planning and marketing with Unity Health, 
which began offering the online photo service about four months ago 
at its St. John's Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis. The relationship 
to which Slack was referring was that between hospital and patient 
_ or, more to the point, future patients. While Unity is weighing 
whether to begin charging for the photo service, it sees the virtual 
nursery primarily as an opportunity to build relations with new mothers 
and their families, a hotly sought after segment of the medical market. 
Properly tended, those relationships will grow for years, Slack said. 
He noted that many new mothers say they selected a certain hospital 
or physician because their mother had used the same one. So offering 
the online photos, he said, simply made sense. ``We had both parents 
and our obstetricians telling us they thought this would be a great 
thing to do,'' Stack said. Relatives are often eager to see a newborn, 
but time constraints and distance often make this difficult. Now, 
as Hammock put it, ``You've literally eliminated mileage and time.'' 
Some people are in more of a hurry than others. ``We had somebody 
yesterday, they had not even bathed the baby and they wanted that 
baby on the Internet,'' Ms. Nalley said. At St. John's Mercy Medical 
Center, it generally takes about two days before a newborn's photo 
is up on the website (www.unity-health.org). ``Typically, the baby's 
picture is posted on the web just about the time of discharge,'' Slack 
said. ``We're more comfortable knowing that the baby is not at a location. 
If they knew it was in the hospital, that's just another risk.'' Although 
hospitals often post such details as birth weight time of arrival 
and special messages, the babies' identities are generally protected 
by using first and middle names, with only a initial for the last 
name. Only the first names of the parents are used. Some hospitals, 
as well as websites specializing in birth announcements, required 
pass codes to enter their nurseries. But Slack said that when parents 
at St. John's were surveyed about such measures, most said they did 
not feel they necessary. At St. John's, where the service has been 
available about 4 months, about 25 percent to 30 percent of the parents 
are using it. The service is provided through First Foto, one of the 
largest companies in the country taking photos of newborns in hospitals. 
While the typical package of traditional photos runs about $35 to 
$40, most hospitals are not yet charging parents to put their baby 
in virtual nurseries, said Jim Grabowski, vice president of infant 
photo marketing for First Foto, which is owned by HASCO International 
in the St. Louis area. ``It's a fresh frontier,'' said Hammack. ``From 
a marketing standpoint, it offers opportunities to look at how you 
can bond with the public, how you can inform the public. I think really 
the only limitations people have is their imagination.''
