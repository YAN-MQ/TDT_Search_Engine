Tonight in our report about how the government spends some of "your 
money," the millionaire land developer, the road he wants the rest 
of us to pay for, and the winter Olympics. Which is how this got to 
be an issue in the first place. From snow basin, Utah, tonight, ABC's 
John Martin. Earl holding owns Sinclair oil, a hotel chain, and the 
Sun Valley resort in Idaho. By one count, he's worth $833 million. 
For 15 years, he's been developing snow basin, a ski resort near Ogden, 
utah. This state road runs nine miles right to his lodge, but that 
is too far for him. So he wants a second road cut here. It will run 
three miles over the hill, save maybe ten minutes, but cost $15 million. 
Originally, holding promised to pay for it himself, but then, Salt 
Lake City won the 2002 winter Olympics. And chose holding's ski resort 
for the downhill races. Now holding has changed his mind about that 
road. You're going to pay for it. We asked his resort manager why. 
So they can move the people efficiently in and out. And security is 
another concern that's been added. Could you hold the games here if 
you didn't have that road, that little three mile road? No, you couldn't. 
Not so, says Howard Peterson, former president of the U.S. ski team. 
I think the taxpayers should feel very badly about this. Peterson 
surveyed the site for the U.S. Olympic committee and found the existing 
road even better than those used for recent Olympics in europe. It 
really comes down to the development of that resort. So it will make 
it a commercial success, but it's not needed for the Olympics? It's 
not needed for the Olympics. Even the U.S. senator who got the money 
from Congress admits as much. It's not absolutely needed, but frankly, 
it's very prudent. But why didn't Salt Lake City mention it when it 
bid for the games? And what about the state of Utah, or the local 
Olympic committee, with $1.4 billion to spend? Would they pay for 
it? No way. His defenders point out that developer holding is putting 
more than $60 million of his money into the facilities here, but to 
reap the itce the games are over and he gets to keep that $15 million 
road. The one built with "your money." John Martin, ABC News, owasin,
