Despite heated debates on how high its deficit should be, Parliament 
on Wednesday approved the 1999 state budget presented by the minority 
government of Milos Zeman. Deputies in the 200-seat chamber voted 
113-82 to give overall approval to the budget. Approval had been expected 
after opposition Christian Democrats openly supported the draft. The 
budget was approved thanks to Zeman's Social Democrats, Christian 
Democrats and Communists. Legislators on Oct. 14 had rejected an earlier 
version, stipulating a deficit of dlrs 930 million in a budget of 
just over dlrs 20 billion (605 billion Czech crowns). Zeman's cabinet 
rewrote the budget to increase the deficit to dlrs 1 billion, arguing 
the stagnating economy needs investment that leads to growth. ``The 
people who want to take this country out of a crisis caused by the 
previous cabinet have prevailed,'' Zeman said, referring to the former 
center-right cabinet of now-opposition leader Vaclav Klaus. ``This 
is a bad budget, we've said over and over _ no need to repeat it today,'' 
Klaus told Czech radio.
