The White House says now it will be at least Friday before it delivers 
answers to 81 questions from the house Judiciary committee. A spokeswoman 
says President Clinton and his lawyers still are working on responses 
which she says should be finished and signed on Friday. The questions 
from Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde are based on independent 
counsel Ken Starr's report to Congress on the Monica Lewinsky matter. 
Hyde is threatening to subpoena the president if he does not voluntarily 
submit his answers by Monday.
