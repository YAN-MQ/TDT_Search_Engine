In Europe, cold weather is blamed for more than 90 deaths. Authorities 
say frigid Arctic air has led to 30 deaths in Romania, 47 in poland 
and the rest in France, Bulgaria and Italy. Many of the victims are 
middle-aged men who drank themselves into a stupor and collapsed outside 
in the cold. Police say nearly a third of the deaths in Poland have 
been among the homeless.
