Like they do every Thanksgiving eve in New York City, they are getting 
ready for the big Macy's Thanksgiving day parade tomorrow. Sadly, 
there's rain in the forecast. This year there are changes in the parade 
proceed after a mishap last year that involved weather. A woman was 
severely injured after handlers lost control of one of the giant balloons. 
Stiff winds sent it crashing into a lamp post. Debris injured spectators. 
With us to talk about the changes in proceed, NBC's Monique braxton 
on central park west in New York, the only place where inflation is 
left unchecked each year by the forever. Inflation is the cause for 
celebration tonight because this is what everyone calls "inflation 
eve," when the balloon handlers gather in the evening and inflate. 
Talking about the specific regulations and restrictions this year, 
one big issue wind. If the gusts are higher than 34 or the sustained 
winds are higher than 23, everything will come to a halt tomorrow 
and all the balloons will be deflated. As a matter of fact, you can 
see that spiderman is kicking up his dust back here. But on a serious 
note, there are going to be more balloon handlers as well to help 
better control the balloons. There are also size limitations this 
year. The balloons can be no taller or higher than 70 feet, no wider 
than 40 feet. Also, there's going to be an additional car under each 
balloon character guiding the character down the street. We want to 
show you one of the characters probably the most famous this year, 
and that is rugrats. They're working on Spike's legs and arms over 
here as you can see. Spike is joined by three new people this year, 
babe, the pig, Dexter, and the wild thing. About 30 balloons in all. 
They leave here tomorrow morninging for Manhattan's upper west side.
