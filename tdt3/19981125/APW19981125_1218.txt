With a mental surplus Rosenborg was unbeatable when they defeated 
Athletic Bilbao 2-1 in the fifth rotation of the European Champions 
League Wednesday. Jan Derek Sorensen scored both goals for the home 
team. Rosenborg gave the Basques a cold shower in the opening minute 
of the game. Andre Bergdolmo fooled Bilbao's offside trap passing 
the ball to Runar Berg, who made an attempt. Sorensen took advantage 
of the rebound making it 1-0 in front of 15,454 fans. The Basques 
had a couple of chances on corner kicks in the first half, but the 
Norwegians were too air-strong in the box. Rosenborg continued the 
pressure in the second half. In the 49th midfielder-playmaker Bent 
Skammelsrud was taken down by two Basque defenders 20 meters outside 
the goal. Sorensen executed a perfect free kick to make it 2-0. However, 
Bilbao pulled one back a minute before the end of the game with a 
goal from Jorge Perez. Still, Rosenborg had momentum for the entire 
second half. There is a reason Bilbao struggles in the lower end of 
the Spanish league. Skammelsrud was booked in the 52nd and misses 
the last game away against Juventus on Dec. 9.
