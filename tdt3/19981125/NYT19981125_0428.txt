The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 26: Thanksgiving 
is still a simple holiday, yet for most of us an occasion of genuine 
feeling in a crowded festal calendar. To judge by house and yard decorations 
in rural America, Halloween has spilled over its once-meager banks 
and washed away all of October and much of November. In cities, the 
Christmas season as we know it now _ an economic indicator with colored 
lights and eggnog _ can no longer be confined, as it used to be, within 
the month that begins on the day after Thanksgiving. But Thanksgiving 
sticks strictly to its allotted Thursday, and the power of this quiet 
holiday is evident in the trouble so many of us go through to get 
home in time to honor it. There is something invariably touching about 
a feast of thanks at which we all find our own reasons to be thankful, 
in which the feeling is named but not the cause. The year is getting 
old and the light weak by the time Thanksgiving comes. The only color 
in the woods is the green of damp moss and the bright orange berries 
of bittersweet. There are historic reasons that Thanksgiving falls 
when it does _ matters of Pilgrim fact and presidential proclamation 
_ but over time it has become a holiday emblematic of this bare season. 
By the end of the eleventh month, the year is ancient enough to have 
shown us its wisdom. We know what to be grateful for by now, or gratitude 
is simply beyond us. You do not have to be very old to remember Thanksgivings 
that began at 4 or 5 in the morning, when women rose alone in the 
dark to start cooking the turkey. By the time the men and children 
got out of bed, the bird had already been roasting for a couple of 
hours on the back porch in its own enameled turkey roaster, a device 
that lived in the basement all but one day a year, resembled an electric 
bassinet, and kept the main oven free for pies. Thanksgiving then 
meant haste in the early hours, a long delay before the big midafternoon 
dinner, and scratch meals _ why eat now? _ for breakfast and lunch, 
a day in which you went straight from starvation to stupefaction, 
in which men and children felt more than ordinarily useless whenever 
they came near the kitchen. Sitting down to the big meal seems like 
the crux of Thanksgiving, but it really comes a couple of hours later. 
The pumpkin pie is gone, the dishes are done, the dogs and overnight 
guests are napping, and there is a strange vacancy in the afternoon 
light. For a moment the year halts, a moment when the wakeful are 
not quite sure what to do with themselves. In that instant, that hollow 
in time, you find yourself listening to the unnatural stillness of 
the afternoon, pausing to look closely at the world around you. That 
is all the celebration necessary on this most modest, most poignant 
of days.
