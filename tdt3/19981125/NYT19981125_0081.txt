I'm not an attorney _ although I do play one when I sit in front of 
my computer monitor. There are several computer programs that allow 
users to print out legal documents with the blanks filled in for buyers 
and sellers, landlords and tenants, plaintiffs and defendants. The 
Texas Bar Association has mounted a legal challenge against them because 
Texas law prohibiting the practice of law without a license also applies 
to publishing companies as well as individuals. But that should be 
of little concern to home users, particularly those in other states. 
Simple legal documents are available in office supply stores, and 
courts have held they're protected as a freedom of speech issue. The 
main concern users should have is that legal documents are sometimes 
challenged in court. Make sure you have the confidence that the documents 
produced by the software are capable of withstanding such a test. 
For everyday situations, the end product will work fine. Quicken Business 
Law Partner 4.0 from Parsons Technology is the newest release in an 
ever-growing field of legal software. It contains more than 100 customized 
documents for small business, including worksheets, forms and letters 
covering a variety of situations: employment, consumer issues, credit, 
real estate and other matters. It also contains a dozen new government 
forms, an interview process to determine what forms are needed, password 
protection for documents, and a spellchecker. For more information,

buyers Looking to purchase a computer? Forbes' Small-Business Home-Office 
Technology Buyers' Guide for the fall offers glimpses and advice on 
desktops, notebooks, monitors, modems, printers, copiers, scanners, 
multifunction scanners, fax machines and networking. It discusses 
operating systems and office suites. The magazine, a supplement to 
Forbes' regular publication, is aimed mainly at small business, but 
it does contain some advice for the home user trying to decide between 
a Windows/Intel based computer and Apple's Macintosh. The brief article 
notes that Apple has made a comeback recently under the re-established 
leadership of company founder Steve Jobs, and it says that ``if everyone 
else at your company or in your line of work is still using a Mac, 
it probably still makes sense for you to own one, too.'' But that's 
about as good as the article gets for the case of buying an Apple. 
It goes on to point out that for general customers, ``the picture 
is more mixed. Some home users may still find Apple's vaulted ease 
of use attractive, but this advantage is more than outweighed by the 
fact that fewer and fewer software programs are being written for 
the Mac. This could change following the launch of Apple's next-generation 
Mac operating system late next year. In the meantime, however, most 
consumers should opt for the safer, if more conventional, PC.'' (Lonnie
