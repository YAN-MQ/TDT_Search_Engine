A republican head count suggests there may not be enough support in 
the House of Representatives to impeach President Clinton. Impeachment 
would require 218 votes. A senior republican aide quoted in "The Washington 
Post" says as many as 20 of the house's 228 GOP members might vote 
against impeachment on a single count of perjury. And 30 might vote 
"no" on an obstruction of justice count.
