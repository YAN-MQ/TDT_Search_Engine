Chinese President Jiang Zemin has begun an historic visit to Japan 
looking for a 21st-century partnership between Asia's two economic 
and military giants. Mr. Jiang is the first Chinese head of state 
to visit Japan. He arrived after a visit to Russia and a meeting with 
the ailing President Boris Yeltsin. Security is very tight for the 
Chinese leader. Even before his arrival, right-wing demonstrators 
used loud speakers to protest an expected Japanese apology for wartime 
atrocities.
