The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 26: U.S. 
District Judge Lowell Reed of Philadelphia has wisely issued an order 
temporarily preventing enforcement of a new federal law restricting 
free speech on the Internet. The Child Online Protection Act, which 
was tucked into the omnibus budget bill passed by Congress last month, 
could greatly harm the right of adults to see or read anything that 
might be deemed unsuitable for children. The measure would require 
commercial sites on the World Wide Web to set up barriers to prevent 
anyone under the age of 17 from gaining access to material deemed 
``harmful to minors'' _ a vague standard that could well include R-rated 
or other controversial materials that are perfectly legal and non-pornographic. 
Operators of Web sites containing such material must ask users to 
provide a credit card or adult identification number, or risk criminal 
penalties. The new law is touted as a way to protect children from 
Internet pornography. But it would not apply to overseas Web sites, 
so children would still have access to smut online. Nor would the 
act inhibit businesses that actually sell X-rated materials online. 
Such businesses already ask for credit card payments, so they would 
be protected from prosecution under the act. Instead, the primary 
effect would be to discourage the free dissemination of constitutionally 
protected material. For example, an online bookseller who includes 
free excerpts of a sexually descriptive novel on a Web site might 
run afoul of the law and be threatened with prosecution because he 
did not screen out children. The Supreme Court last year struck down 
as overly broad the 1996 Communications Decency Act that made it a 
crime to send or display indecent material on the Internet where youngsters 
might see it. The new measure is no improvement. Even the Justice 
Department, which is now defending the law, has raised serious questions 
about its constitutionality. The way to protect children from adult 
materials is through parental monitoring and guidance, not by locking 
down the Web for everyone. The courts should quickly scotch this attempt 
to censor Internet speech.
