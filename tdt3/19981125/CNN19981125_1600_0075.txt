The flood of holiday travel has begun. Officials in Chicago predict 
1 million travelers will pass through O'hare and Midway airports this 
Thanksgiving weekend. Officials in Wisconsin say there should be heavy 
traffic on state highways, especially since Sunday is also the end 
of deer hunting season. The port authority of New York and New Jersey 
is urging travelers to allow additional time to reach their destinations. 
Officials say added security precautions make early arrivals necessary. 
Mark Potter has more from fort Lauderdale. Need to see your I.D., 
please. Around the country, travelers jammed the airports, hoping 
to fly out of town with as much ease as possible given the busy holiday. 
Those who got to the terminals early had the best chance. For curbside 
baggage handlers, it was a boomtime event. Lots of work, and lots 
of tips. Thank you very much. Have a good holiday. At FT. Lauderdale, 
broward sheriff's deputy Chris Presley kept the traffic flowing smoothly 
with a little cajoling, a little finesse and a Philosophy for making 
it work. You rest, you rust. In other words, keep the traffic flowing. 
Don't give them a chance to set up. That's all. Get 'em in, get 'em 
out. Kind of like "rawhide." Each and every traveler had a story about 
why braving the crowds and flying out of town this Thanksgiving is 
so important. I'm going to see my father, because he just got out 
of the hospital. So it really is a nice Thanksgiving. I'm going to 
Monroe, Louisiana, to see my mother for the holidays. I'm going to 
Laguna beach, the desert and San Diego to meet my father-in-law for 
the first time for the Thanksgiving holiday. With motives like those, 
it made any of the hassles from travel seem not so bad. And for those 
who thought the day before Thanksgiving was busy, wait until sunday 
when most people are returning home. That, experts say, will actually 
be the busiest travel day of the thanksgiving holiday. Mark Potter, 
CNN, FT. Lauderdale.
