The former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet will learn today whether 
British authorities can extradite him to Spain to face charges of 
crimes against humanity. A five-member panel from the House of Lords 
will rule whether the retired general un -- enjoys immunity from prosecution 
as a former head of state. The former strongman was arrested last 
month in London on an extradition warrant from Spain, which was to 
try him for human rights abuses during his 17-year rule, but a lower 
court said the arrest was illegal. And in a related development, a 
French judge has issued a second international arrest warrant for 
the general. The warrant accuses him of the detention and torture 
of two French citizens who disappeared following the ouster of Chilean 
President Salvador Allende in 1973.
