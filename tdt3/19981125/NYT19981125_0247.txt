It is difficult to reconcile the watercolor renderings of pert Dutch-roofed 
houses and sprawling Tudor apartment complexes with the rocky forest 
that rings the very private enclave of Tuxedo Park. But if developers 
and town officials have their way _ and it appears they are close 
_ Tuxedo, with its population of 3,000, may quadruple in size over 
the next decade or two. Bulldozers and blasting caps will arrive in 
the next few years, and this sleepy town _ with its scattering of 
vacant shop fronts _ will get the development it has dreamed of and 
dreaded for the last 20 years. In Tuxedo, 40 miles northwest of Manhattan, 
two private developers are planning several thousand units of housing, 
including shingle-style cottages by architect Robert A.M. Stern. The 
town and its inhabitants _ those of the gated Tuxedo Park, as well 
as homeowners of more modest means in the rest of the township _ are 
struggling to bring order to the new subdivisions, which they worry 
will clog the main route through town, overcrowd schools and overburden 
the sewers. But few of the townspeople vow to stop the developers 
cold. ``It's their land,'' said Mary Yrizarry, chairwoman of the Tuxedo 
Conservation and Taxpayers Association, alluding to the developers 
of both Tuxedo Reserve (a partnership that includes Related Cos. in 
Manhattan) and the corporation known as Sterling Forest LLC. Together, 
they own about 4,500 bucolic acres. Their formal applications to build 
are stacked in the basement of the Tuxedo town hall. ``Hey, people 
who own property have certain rights,'' said Susan Goodfellow, the 
mayor of Tuxedo Park, an incorporated village of 325 families within 
the larger township of Tuxedo. ``You work with them.'' That is what 
Tuxedo is trying to do. By Dec. 22, the town will produce its latest 
master plan for growth. Town Supervisor Kenneth Magar said the plan 
will call for a population increase to ``between 10,000 and 12,000 
people.'' While the possible quadrupling of population ``might shock 
some people,'' Ms. Goodfellow said, ``it's better than the 28,000'' 
called for in an earlier master plan. The proposed developments, including 
1,620 units planned for Sterling Forest, about three miles north of 
the town center, show clustered housing _ around a new village green 
in the Stern version, around two golf courses in the other _ leaving 
broad swaths of undeveloped land. While many residents praise the 
concept of small lots near town greens, now endorsed by a national 
planning movement known as New Urbanism, they want the developers 
to pay for whatever problems they cause. The Tuxedo Reserve developers 
say they will ``mitigate'' _ developer-speak for pay to make amends 
_ any damage, but haven't always specified how. Ms. Yrizarry commended 
the developers' pledge to protect ``the most sensitive area _ a beautiful 
little lake in a protected valley.'' But there is the question of 
the steep slopes. ``I don't see how they can help blasting,'' she 
said. Town officials agree. The urge to develop around enclaves like 
Tuxedo Park _ one of the country's first subdivisions when it was 
conceived in 1886 as a retreat for wealthy deer hunters _ is part 
of a trend to graft development onto towns, rather than around suburban 
shopping centers. After years of building subdivisions on cheap land 
in the middle of nowhere, or around a vast mall, developers have finally 
got the message: build a better village (near an existing village 
with cachet), and people will flock to it. Since Forest Hills Gardens 
was created in Queens, New York City, in 1915 as working-class housing 
and was promptly snapped up by wealthy homeowners, Americans have 
shown a yearning for stucco-and-half-timbered village life _ especially 
next door to a railroad station. Their wishes were largely ignored 
for decades. Enter Stern, master of nostalgic villas and shingled 
bungalows. An earlier version of the Tuxedo Reserve development, which 
called for 2,400 units, received a preliminary approval from the town 
in 1991. But this year, a newly elected town board demanded far fewer 
apartments and town houses _ and fewer units overall. The developers 
responded last year by bringing in Stern and lowering the density 
to 1,747 units, while increasing open space from 66 to 77 percent. 
There are plans to donate land for a school, to build housing for 
the elderly and to sponsor small-town retailing. (One cheerful rendering 
shows a butcher shop and a store selling cider, across from a cafe.) 
Stern hopes his plan will relieve what he calls ``a general sense 
of pessimism'' in the town. No one questions that for a decade the 
town has stopped growing. The pharmacy moved out five years ago; the 
hospital folded in 1995. An antiques shop moved out last week. This 
week, Magar said the Tuxedo Reserve developers had agreed to lower 
the number of units to 1,383. If they reduced that number to 1,300, 
the town supervisor said, he would endorse the plan, and he said an 
informal poll of the town board showed that it would pass. The other 
developer in the wings, Sterling Forest LLC, plans to build its 1,620 
housing units farther away from the center of Tuxedo, on 2,250 acres 
held back from 15,800 acres of Sterling Forest that were deeded to 
New York state in February. But the Sterling Forest development, for 
those older than 55, is less controversial. ``Housing for older people 
is perceived to be tax-positive: they don't have kids in the schools, 
and they don't use up a lot of town services, like police,'' Magar 
said. In his Tuxedo Reserve plan, Stern, now the dean of the Yale 
School of Architecture, has created different-size lots with $140,000 
two-bedroom apartments and $700,000 ``estate size'' homes. The designs 
would be regulated by guidelines issued by the developers. After reviewing 
the Tuxedo Reserve brochures and press releases, Tony Hiss, whose 
book ``The Experience of Place'' explores the ways communities are 
coping with urban sprawl, said the developers' stated goals _ to bring 
jobs and businesses, to increase the tax base and to improve the quality 
of life _ ``generated a lot of questions.'' Although the developers 
have increased the percentage of open space, Hiss called the new figure 
``really quite low.'' In Carmel, Calif., he said, a new planned development 
on land-grant property preserves 90 percent of the open space. ``I 
would ask whether there is a permanent fund to care for the forest 
and wildlife,'' he said. ``How will the developers mitigate the impact 
on traffic? If the new town does attract further development, what 
would be its effect? And if it will attract new jobs, will they be 
permanent?'' The developers argue that their revision _ not yet public 
but summarized for this reporter _ addresses many of these concerns 
and that others _ like what to do about traffic _ are still to be 
worked out. They term the percentage of open space high. ``In most 
master-planned communities, it's the opposite _ two-thirds to three-quarters 
is developed,'' said Glen Vetromile, who is managing the project for 
Related Cos. The people of Tuxedo, he added, ``are doing a lot of 
soul-searching right now about what they want to be.'' They will continue 
to search. A hearing on the new plan is expected in February, Magar 
said. Construction, which could start late next year, will more likely 
begin in 2000, he said. Meanwhile, the groups plan to keep monitoring 
the projects. ``We won't give up,'' Ms. Yrizarry vowed, ``until the 
last road goes in and the last house is put up.''
