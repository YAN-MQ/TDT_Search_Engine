Government researchers are recommending screening for diabetes should 
begin 20 years earlier, at the age of 25, rather than 45. "The journal 
of the American medical association" says that could prevent such 
complications from diabetes as blindness, kidney failure and amputations. 
Type-two diabetes, as it's called, generally develops after the age 
of 40. Now it's showing up much earlier in obese people, and those 
who don't exercise.
