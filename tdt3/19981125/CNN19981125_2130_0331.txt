The Navy has charged an admiral with adultery. David Ensor looks at 
the ramifications of the case. 54-year-old rear admiral John scudi 
is charged, Navy officials say, with two counts of adultery, with 
making false official statements and with obstruction of justice. 
Navy sources say the married admiral is accused of having affairs 
with a Navy civilian employee and with a defense contractor, going 
back as far as 1993. In the past, senior officers have often been 
allowed to retire quietly when charged with adultery, for the good 
of the service, while lower-ranking personnel have often faced court-martial, 
as did sergeant major of the army gene McKinney and air force lieutenant 
Kelly Flynn. The new secretary of the Navy says admiral scudi should 
get the same treatment as anyone else. Well, I think we need to treat 
our leaders and our enlisted people the same way and we need to treat 
this case and all cases with that very much in mind. I'm struck by 
how this case involves questions about improprieties with contractors, 
and that means we need to pay special attention to it. Those improprieties 
include, Navy officials say, evidence the admiral approved noncompetitive 
contracts with the defense contractor's firm while maintaining an 
adulterous sexual relationship with her. There is also pressure for 
serious punishment from conservative groups. Bob Maginnis is a former 
Pentagon inspector general, now with the family research council. 
This is right in the center of Washington. And, of course, with the 
scandal concerning the president ongoing, those two things come together, 
and we see the military taking a very harsh stand, very harsh approach 
to this particular admiral, which allegedly is doing many of the same 
things the president's accused of doing -- perjury, obstruction of 
justice, adultery, et cetera. He will probably end up being court-martialled. 
Navy officials agree a court-martial is a strong possibility, but 
because of the contractor improprieties. The case is tentatively scheduled 
for a preliminary hearing December 14th. It's only the second time 
the Navy has filed criminal charges against an admiral since the current 
military code of justice was adopted back in 1951. David Ensor, CNN,
