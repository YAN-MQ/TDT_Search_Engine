It's back to more warnings to Iraq from the White House. The Clinton 
administration says Iraq's response has been inadequate to United 
Nations inspectors' requests for weapons-related documents. At this 
point, U.S. officials seem willing to test Baghdad's compliance in 
a range of areas before making new threats of military strikes. White 
House Correspondent Nick Senione reports. Just days after the United 
States and Britain called off plans to bomb Iraq, Baghdad is again 
rebuffing U.N. weapons inspectors, known collectively as UNSCOM, this 
time by refusing to hand over weapons-related documents. Faced with 
repeated questions about what the United States is prepared to do, 
President Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart refused to tell reporters 
what actions by Iraq would trigger a military response, but he did 
suggest U.S. officials are waiting to see whether Baghdad lives up 
to its pledges to cooperate with arms inspections in a range of areas. 
This isn't just about documents. This is a -- this is a test that 
the -- Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis have to pass about whether UNSCOM 
can do their job effectively. So it's about documents. It's about 
access to sensitive sites. It's about access to people with knowledge 
of the program. Even though there have been no new reports of U.N. 
weapons inspectors being blocked from specific sites in Iraq, spokesman 
Lockhart says the United States remains very skeptical of Iraq's intentions.
