The computer animation company, pixar, is waiting on pins and Needles 
to see how its latest film will do at the box office. Casey wian looks 
at "A bug's life." ah! Run for your lives! "A bug's life" will have 
a monster impact on pixar's bottom line. For pixar, this is the primary 
source of revenues over the next year. They won't be releasing their 
next film till probably the holiday season 1999, which will be "toy 
story 2." So relative to revenue generation, operating income and 
earnings, this will really be it. But "it" could be huge. Pixar is 
splitting "A bug's life's" profits 50/50 with Disney as part of a 
Five-film partnership. For "toy story," pixar's cut was just 15%. 
"A bug's life" is expected to rake in anywhere from $500 million to 
$1 billion in worldwide box office, home video, television and merchandising 
revenue. Some Wall Street analysts predict pixar's profit from "A 
bug's life" could top $100 million. Pixar CEO Steve jobs says his 
company could become the next Disney. Much depends on "A bug's life." 
In a recent filing with the securities and exchange commission, pixar 
said if "A bug's life" is not an extraordinary success, the company 
faces significant losses. Perhaps the biggest challenge will be overcoming 
a crowded slate of holiday family films, including the "rugrats" movie, 
the "babe" sequel and "prince of Egypt." This is something that we, 
obviously, spent a lot of time thinking about. And it's funny, you 
know, we've come to the conclusion that in the end, it perhaps doesn't 
really matter all that much. We will rise and fall on the strengths 
of our own films. "A bug's life" also faces competition from dreamworks' 
"antz," a More adult-themed animated film that's already made $84 
million. Dreamworks rushed "antz" to the screen ahead of "A bug's 
life," intensifying an already-bitter rivalry with the pixar/Disney 
team. But it appears there's room at the picnic for both. "A bug's 
life" has been open at this Hollywood theater since Friday and has 
broken an opening-weekend box office record set in 1995 by "toy story."
