Chilean President Eduardo Frei is meeting armed forces chiefs to discuss 
Britain's court ruling that Chile's former military leader, General 
Augusto Pinochet, is not immune from prosecution. The decision clears 
the way for the general to face extradition to Spain on charges of 
genocide and torture. Here's James Reynolds in Santiago. In the hours 
after the verdict was announced, supporters and opponents of General 
Pinochet began to hold rival demonstrations here in the Chilean capital. 
Hundreds of students tried to march through the center of the city 
in celebration of the verdict. The police used water cannon and tear 
gas to disperse them. The police were also called to the Spanish Embassy 
and to the British ambassador's residence where supporters of General 
Pinochet had gathered to voice their anger at the ruling. President 
Eduardo Frei has been quick to react. He's convened a meeting of the 
National Security Council, a body made up of politicians and military 
commanders which only meets in times of national crisis. James Reynolds, 
BBC News, Santiago.
