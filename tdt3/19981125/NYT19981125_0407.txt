Ending a 57-day standoff, representatives of the Sea Shepherd Conservation 
Society on Wednesday moved their second boat away from the reservation 
of the Makah Indians, where some society members had said they would 
come between the tribe and its plan to hunt whales. The Makahs, who 
wanted to resume whaling Oct. 1, say they still plan to revive a tribal 
tradition by paddling a cedar canoe on a hunt for a whale. With swells 
7 to 8 feet high in the Pacific Ocean, the weather would now prevent 
the hunt, said Lisa Distefano, international director of Sea Shepherd, 
a marine conservation and advocacy group. ``The fact that they didn't 
kill a whale, for us, is the biggest victory,'' Ms. Distefano said. 
``We feel better after having met them face to face, all of them, 
and after having seen that nonlethal alternatives are something they'll 
talk about.'' One Sea Shepherd boat has moved to Seattle, which is 
about 130 miles from the reservation, and the other left Wednesday 
for Friday Harbor, about 80 miles away. Smaller conservation groups 
said they would remain near Neah Bay, where they could monitor a tribal 
hunt. The Makah Indians, who traditionally hunted whales in the Pacific 
and the Strait of Juan de Fuca from their land on the Olympic Peninsula, 
stopped whaling 70 years ago when hunters on the East Coast depleted 
the population of the gray whale, now an internationally endangered 
species. When the gray whale was taken off the federal endangered 
species list in 1994, the Makahs expressed interest in resuming the 
hunt, a move supported by the government but criticized by environmentalists. 
Members of the tribe and the Sea Shepherd society, based in Marina 
del Ray, Calif., met Monday to discuss their concerns. ``Many of the 
Makah, the silent majority, support whaling nonlethally,'' Ms. Distefano 
said, suggesting whale-watching trips, re-enactments of whaling expeditions 
and native canoeing as alternatives to the hunt. ``It was important 
for us to leave so the silent majority can voice themselves. They 
didn't want to be allied with anyone from the outside.'' But Makah 
officials are committed to continuing the hunt, saying that the prospect 
of returning to whaling has strengthened the structure of the tribe 
and given young people something to be proud of, a modern link with 
their traditions. The Makah Indians' Treaty of 1855 with the United 
States government made the tribe the only one specifically allowed 
to hunt whales. The modern tribe, with support from the Clinton administration 
and a $310,000 grant from the Commerce Department, last year won a 
rare exemption from the worldwide whaling ban, allowing it to take 
up to five gray whales per year in the next five years. The tribe 
plans to smoke the whale meat and make it into jerky that will be 
distributed to families and eaten at community gatherings. As of 1990, 
55.1 percent of the tribal members lived below the poverty line. Donny 
Swan, a Makah whaler who comes from a traditional whaling family, 
said he and seven companions who will set out in a dugout canoe continue 
to prepare for the hunt by paddling at 5 a.m. and participating in 
spiritual bathing. ``People are glad to see them gone,'' Swan said 
of the Sea Shepherd representatives. ``I hope we don't see them again.'' 
He said the tribe planned to hunt a whale ``as soon as the weather 
breaks.'' Ms. Distefano said the tribe would have to answer to international 
outrage if it killed a whale, which is done by harpooning the animal 
and then shooting it.
