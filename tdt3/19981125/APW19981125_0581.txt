The world's largest industrial merger _ British Petroleum Co. PLC's 
planned purchase of Amoco Corp. _ should get clearance by European 
Union regulators soon, the EU's top antitrust watchdog said Wednesday. 
``It looks like we can indeed authorize the operation,'' EU Competition 
Commissioner Karel Van Miert told reporters. He declined to say if 
the EU would attach conditions to the approval. An aide to Van Miert 
said the decision was likely mid-December. BP agreed in August to 
pay dlrs 48 billion for Amoco Corp., creating the world's No. 3 oil 
giant in the biggest-ever foreign takeover of an American company. 
Lawyers following the case have said the merger is not likely to trigger 
serious EU antitrust alarms. The EU's executive body, the European 
Commission checks all mergers with a major impact on EU markets and 
can demand changes or veto those judged harmful to fair competition.
