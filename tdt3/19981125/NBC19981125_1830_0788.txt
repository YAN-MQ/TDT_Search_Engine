NBC news "in depth" tonight -- America on the move, traveling far 
and wide for the Thanksgiving holiday. This is the scene at the Philadelphia 
Amtrak station. The railroad says 90,000 people will ride the Amtrak 
rails today, more than 500,000 this holiday weekend. Dallas tonight, 
interstate 35 as it passes through the downtown area -- some of the 
28 million cars taking to the roads this Thanksgiving eve. And at 
the world's busiest airport, Chicago O'hare, 245,000 passengers today 
alone -- nearly 1 million over the long weekend. With a look at the 
great escape under way tonight, we begin our "in depth" reporting 
with NBC's Jim Avila. Heavy rain in the northwest. Closed traffic 
lanes on interstate 5 south of Seattle today. Flood warnings in coastal 
Washington and Oregon. But the storms caused few delays for the 33 
million Americans making trips of more than 100 miles this weekend. 
Hey, guys. You got tags on your luggage? In suburban Chicago, the 
velasquez family got an early start -- up before dawn for a vacation 
to Mexico. It's the second heaviest travel weekend of the year. Oh, 
man, the tickets! So this family arrives at O'hare airport two hours 
before their flight. We're up a little early. If you haven't done 
it, and I've done it. O'hare, today, is crazy. And it's not crazy 
now, so it's worth it. More Americans fly now than every before. A 
record number of flights, up 2% over last year. why? Experts say families 
are more spread out and the economy is strong. People have money. 
At the airports, planes jammed. The 1998 load rate of 73% is the highest 
since 1946. And because of that, the average fare is at its highest 
in history. Passengers are paying an average 14 cents a mile, rising 
steadily since deregulation in the 1980s. Harold salfen of the international 
airlines passengers association. The airlines continue to go up on 
their prices because they can get that price for that seat. So where 
are the bargains in travel this year? Driving. Colorado's David Patterson 
filled up his four-wheel drive this morning for 85 cents a gallon. 
A tankful, $7 cheaper than last year. Seems a lot less than it has 
been in the past. Colorado has always had higher prices than other 
parts of the country and we're happy to see them come down a little 
bit. In fact, across the country, the average gas price is at its 
lowest Mark since March of 1992. $1.05 for regular, $1.14 for midgrade 
and $1.20 for premium. Aaa's Johnathan Lehrer. Why are prices so low? 
Well, it has to do with a relatively stable economy and an oversupply 
of oil on the world market. Another reason to be thankful as the most 
mobile country in the world heads off for a record travel day. Jim 
Avila, NBC news, Chicago.
