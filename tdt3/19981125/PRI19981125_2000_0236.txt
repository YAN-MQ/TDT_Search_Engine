American League batting champ, Bernie Williams, has signed a new seven-year 
contract with baseball's New York Yankees. The contract is worth $87.5 
million with an option that could bring it to $99 million if the Yankees 
choose to keep Williams on in 2006. Williams had been courted by the 
Boston Red Sox and the Arizona Diamond Backs. He was considered a 
key player in the Yankees' victorious regular season in its World 
Series championship.
