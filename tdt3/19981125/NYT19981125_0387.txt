Many European leaders applauded Wednesday's ruling against the former 
dictator of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, but within the U.S. government 
and in some legal circles, there was a note of consternation at the 
potential power of a Spanish judge to transcend national borders in 
the name of international law. Muted responses from United States 
officials reflected some uneasiness in Washington with the idea that 
former government leaders can be held responsible by foreign courts. 
At the State Department and the National Security Council, spokesmen 
said that Pinochet's fate was a matter for the Spanish and British 
courts. Alfred Rubin, a professor of international law at the Fletcher 
School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston, said the power of the Spanish 
judge in the case to reach across national boundaries was troubling. 
``What's to prevent Spain from extraditing Henry Kissinger, who was 
involved in the coup?'' he asked. ``What's to prevent Spain from ruling 
the world? The whole thing seems to be leading to chaos, with every 
country sitting in judgment of the revolutions of other countries. 
That strikes me as undemocratic.'' Across Europe, many officials were 
openly elated. In Geneva, Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, said the ruling ``will hearten human-rights defenders 
around the world.'' The decision ``confirmed the emerging international 
consensus against impunity,'' said Ms. Robinson, a former president 
of Ireland. In Paris, French President Jacques Chirac said: ``May 
justice be done, and may light be fully shed on Pinochet's responsibilities.'' 
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said: ``It's a surprise, it's 
a joy, it's bad news for dictators.'' France, along with Spain, Belgium 
and Switzerland, has sought Pinochet's extradition for crimes against 
their citizens. The United States has not. German Justice Minister 
Hertha Daubler-Gmelin has said she would support an extradition request 
if there was evidence of damage suffered by German citizens. The German 
Greens Party, junior partner in the government, praised the ruling. 
``This confirmation of human rights from the motherland of democracy 
clears the way for legal proceedings against a criminal dictator to 
take their course'' in Spain, a ``democracy which is still young,'' 
said the party's co-leader, Gunda Roestel. In the United States, relatives 
of victims praised the ruling. Michael Moffitt, whose wife of 113 
days, Ronni Moffitt, was killed by Pinochet's secret police, said 
the ruling was a ``great vindication.'' Ms. Moffitt died along with 
a former Chilean foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, when their car 
was blown up by a bomb in Washington in 1976. ``It's a great Thanksgiving 
Day present for a lot of people, a lot of victims of that beast,'' 
said Moffitt, 47, a financial manager living in New Jersey. More than 
3,000 people were killed as the general took power in a 1973 coup. 
The dead included Charles Horman, a 31-year-old American working as 
a filmmaker and writer in Chile. Wednesday his mother, Elizabeth Horman, 
said the ruling gave her a measure of happiness. ``The wheels of justice 
grind slowly but they grind exceedingly small,'' said Mrs. Horman, 
an artist who lives in Manhattan and is in her 90s. ``I want Pinochet 
in prison,'' she said. ``Do you realize what he did to us? Do you 
know what kind of man my son was? He was attractive and humorous and 
loving. And he was a human rights advocate. And that's why he got 
caught up in the coup.'' Michael Ratner, director of the Center for 
Constitutional Rights, which represents Horman's family, said the 
Letelier and Moffitt killings represented strong legal cases against 
the former dictator. But he added that it was far from certain that 
the Justice Department would move against Pinochet. Though mid-level 
officials at the Justice Department have discussed extraditing Pinochet 
in those killings, they have considered it as an option only if the 
former dictator won immunity from the British courts. Any extradition 
proceeding by the United States would have to be approved by the State 
Department and the White House. In Madrid, Isabel Allende, the daughter 
of Salvador Allende, the elected president of Chile who was overthrown 
by Pinochet's coup, said: ``Future dictators will have to think very 
hard before they turn to killing, before they betray their oaths, 
before they break their democratic constitutions.'' She added: ``This 
is not a case of revenge. What we want is justice. We are fighting 
for justice and not impunity. I feel great satisfaction and it is 
a great, historical moment.''
