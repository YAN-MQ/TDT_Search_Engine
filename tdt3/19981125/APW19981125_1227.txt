Roberto Baggio came off the bench to score twice in the closing minutes 
Wednesday, leading Internazionale of Milan past defending titlist 
Real Madrid 3-1 and into first place in Group C of the Champions League. 
Baggio, who's struggled all season with a knee injury, entered as 
a substitute in the 68th minute with the score tied 1-1 after the 
clubs had traded goals eight minutes apart early in the second half. 
With four minutes left, the 31-year-old veteran took a pass from Argentine 
midfielder Diego Simeone and rifled a low shot from 11 meters (yards) 
out that found the net off German 'keeper Bodo Illgner's foot. Baggio 
then wrapped up the dramatic win in injury time, taking another pass 
from Simeone and rounding Illgner with a series of fakes before slotting 
the ball home before 80,000 at sold-out San Siro Stadium. Italy's 
1994 World Cup goal-scoring star played alongside two-time FIFA Player 
of the Year Ronaldo _ who also has had knee trouble _ for just the 
third time this season. And the Brazilian set up Inter's opening goal. 
Ronaldo's rising blast from 25 meters (yards) out in the 51st minute 
deflected off Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano's leg and flew past Illgner. 
Real equalized quickly, when Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf headed 
in Brazilian midfielder Savio's precise cross. The result likely saved 
Inter coach Luigi Simoni's job. Club owner Massimo Moratti had demanded 
a victory Wednesday.
