An estimated 1.3 million Americans are injured each year because of 
medication errors such as taking the wrong drug or dosage. The institute 
for safe medical practices estimates 25% to 30% of the problems are 
caused because health care workers mix up drugs with similar names. 
More than 1,000 drugs have names that either look or sound alike. 
The food and drug administration is now testing a computer program 
that predicts which drugs will be most confusing so drugmakers can 
change the name or pharmacists can take extra care. There are other 
ways to avoid medication errors.
