Finns honored former President Mauno Koivisto on his 75th birthday 
Wednesday for helping Finland cling to its ties with the West despite 
fears of provoking its giant neighbor Russia during the Cold War. 
Finland's senior statesman is also credited with building bridges 
between East and West during periods of deep mistrust between the 
superpowers. Koivisto led Finland from 1982 to 1994 and routinely 
met with leaders from both sides of the former Iron Curtain. In 1990, 
former U.S. President George Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 
asked Koivisto to arrange a summit in Helsinki to discuss the Gulf 
crisis with one week's notice. ``From the moment I met him, I saw 
that he was one of the best minds working on evaluating the Soviet 
Union,'' Bush said in an article published Wednesday in the Finnish 
Journal of Foreign Affairs. ``His judgment proved to be right on target.'' 
Bush said he used a ``back channel relationship'' with Koivisto to 
discuss East-West relations for many years. In the same magazine, 
Gorbachev agreed that Koivisto had a unique understanding of Russia. 
``He is fluent in Russian, and knows us better probably than any other 
noteworthy politician in the West,'' Gorbachev wrote. In his memoirs, 
Koivisto relates how Gorbachev approached him in 1990, a year before 
the Soviet collapse, asking for help because ``he was in great trouble.'' 
Koivisto promised to assist Gorbachev, and passed on the Soviet leader's 
concern to Bush in a private meeting. Finland, which shares a 1,270-kilometer 
(790-mile) border with Russia, fought two bitter wars against the 
Soviet Union from 1939 to 1944, and during the Cold War the Finns 
subjected their foreign policy decisions for Moscow's tacit approval. 
But during Koivisto's term, neutral Finland joined the Council of 
Europe, the European Economic Area and applied for membership of the 
European Union which it joined in 1995. On Wednesday, President Martti 
Ahtisaari hosted a luncheon for the former president and the government 
honored him with a special reception.
