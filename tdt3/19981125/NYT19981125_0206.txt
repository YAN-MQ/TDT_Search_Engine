Everyone knows about the Mayflower. A group of Puritans were headed 
for Virginia but steered badly off course and landed far to the north. 
After dispossessing the Indians, they began an annual celebration 
of Thanksgiving, dressed in their strict buckles and all-black. According 
to Caleb Johnson, just about the only truth in that paragraph is the 
name of the ship. Johnson, 22, who graduated last summer from Texas 
Tech University, said he created the Mayflower Web Pages (members.aol.com/calebj/mayflower.html) 
to fill a need for an authoritative online source. ``I have been to 
just about all the Pilgrim-Mayflower-Thanksgiving sites on the Internet,'' 
Johnson wrote by e-mail. His conclusion: ``They are generally full 
of errors.'' One of his pages, ``Message to Teachers,'' refutes much 
of the information in a contemporary school lesson plan, as well as 
offers suggestions for further online study. ``I think he has done 
his homework,'' James W. Baker, senior historian at the Plimoth Plantation 
Museum, said of Johnson. Baker also said he agreed with Johnson about 
the lesson plan: ``Boy is it sloppy. It's got all sorts of made-up 
facts.'' Johnson, who lives in Portland, Ore., recommends the Web 
pages of the Plimoth Plantation Museum (www.plimoth.org), the Pilgrim 
Hall Museum (www.pilgrimhall.org) and the John Alden House (www.alden.org). 
As for his own Mayflower site, besides pages on the domestic life 
of the Pilgrims, the Mayflower itself and its crew, it includes such 
documents as the Mayflower Compact, the peace treaty with Massasoit, 
chief of the Wampanoag confederation, books and letters written by 
the Pilgrims and contemporary accounts of them. Johnson's pages grew 
out of his high-school interest in genealogy. ``I was involved in 
an America Online `Mayflower descendants' message board at the time,'' 
he said, ``which was constantly getting such basic questions as, `Was 
my ancestor John Doe on the Mayflower?' '' Johnson, a descendant himself, 
created an online Mayflower passenger list and built it up weekly, 
adding historical sidelights and texts. The current pages go way beyond 
the expected genealogy and ``First Thanksgiving'' pages. Take, for 
example, ``Pilgrim Criminal Records.'' (Edward Doty: dueling, breach 
of contract, slander, assault, theft; John Billington: hanged in 1630 
for murder, among others.) Individual Mayflower pages, some linked 
from the Plimoth Plantation site, take intriguing directions: Pilgrim 
and Wampanoag clothing, religious beliefs, weapons of the Pilgrims, 
a biography of the Patuxet Indian Tisquantum, games played by Pilgrim 
children and more. The genealogy section includes guidance on tracing 
one's own Mayflower lineage. Johson doesn't answer questions himself 
but his pages provide links to the General Society of Mayflower Descendants, 
several other genealogy organizations and professionals, and public 
records. He has pages on ``Common Mayflower Genealogy Hoaxes,'' e-mail 
addresses of known Mayflower descendants and a list of presidential 
ancestries. (He lists seven presidents and three first ladies as Mayflower 
descendants, but only one vice president who did not later become 
President: Dan Quayle.) About those myths. For the record, Johnson 
says the Mayflower Pilgrims were Separatists, not Puritans. (They 
all stemmed from Calvinist roots, but there were some distinctions, 
Baker said in agreement, adding that the early Puritans considered 
the Pilgrim Separatists more extreme.) The Pilgrims did not wear buckles 
and did wear colorful clothing. ``From the probate inventories of 
Plymouth Colony,'' Johnson writes, ``we learn that Gov. William Bradford 
had a green gown, violet cloak, lead-colored suit with silver buttons 
and a red waistcoat. Elder William Brewster had green drawers, a red 
cap, a violet coat, and a blue suit.'' Plymouth, called Patuxet by 
the Indians, was open because the Patuxet tribe had been wiped out 
by a plague before the Mayflower arrived _ except perhaps for one 
member, Tisquantum, or Squanto. ``In fact,'' Johnson writes, ``it 
appears Massasoit liked the idea of having Englishmen neighbors and 
allies because it increased his own power within the region by keeping 
his enemies at bay.'' And there is no record that the Pilgrims' ever 
repeated their first Thanksgiving, he writes. Baker adds that the 
Pilgrims' three-day harvest festival was not a typical religious ceremony; 
nor did the Pilgrims themselves call it Thanksgiving. ``I think he's 
fairly accurately hit at some popular misconceptions,'' Baker said 
of Johnson's Mayflower pages. Nuggets of information lie in the wills 
and estate inventories of Mayflower passengers. One wonders what Susannah 
and Mary Soule did to cause their father, George Soule, to leave them 
12 pence apiece but leave land to all his other children.
