Michel Camdessus, director-general of the International Monetary Fund, 
said Wednesday that the worst of the global financial crisis is over, 
a Spanish news agency reported. Camdessus said it was possible to 
avoid a global recession, although the risk hadn't completely disappeared 
because ``the treatment has only just started,'' the state-owned news 
agency EFE quoted him as saying. ``To those frivolous commentators 
and prophets of doom who've been chronicling the death foretold of 
the Brazilian and Latin American financial system, I say today what 
I said yesterday: The Latin American domino won't fall,'' the agency 
quoted Camdessus as saying during a Madrid meeting of Spanish business 
leaders. The IMF chief reserved particular praise for what he called 
Brazil's ``courageous'' three-year economic and financial reform program. 
Camdessus also promised the IMF would not abandon the crisis-ridden 
Russian economy, but that ``Russia must first show it is willing to 
help itself.''
