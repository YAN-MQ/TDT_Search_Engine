Moss, a four-year-old interior design store on 146 Greene St. in SoHo, 
has added four new floors, but customers will not climbing stairs 
to reach them. Instead, they will be clicking a mouse. That's because 
Moss' new floors exist within a computer program and can be reached 
only through what could be Manhattan's first virtual elevator. Murray 
Moss, the store's owner, has wanted to expand for quite some time. 
But it occurred to him that a larger physical space might not be the 
best solution. ``I asked myself what my products would look like virtually,'' 
said Moss, who is 49. So he and Ron Ryan, a graphic designer, created 
a computer graphics program that allows customers to choose an image 
of an elevator to lift them digitally to virtual floors with animated 
displays of furniture. It even plays elevator music. The virtual elevator 
of this cyberstore is reached on a large-screen Macintosh G3 computer 
monitor, which is near oil-and-vinegar set created by the Italian 
industrial designer Ettore Sottsass, a shrimp bowl by Nambe, a manufacturing 
firm based in New Mexico, and a silver inflated lounge chair by Ilkka 
Suppanen. On the monitor, you choose one of the four floors. Two digital 
voices, who introduce themselves as Fred and Princess, tell the story 
of the virtual Moss store. ``For some time, we have wanted to expand,'' 
the voices say in unison, ``But Barbara and Ken Cooke, our upstairs 
neighbors, weren't ready to move.'' Moss explained later that he had 
never really had a conflict with his upstairs neighbors. ``I just 
thought it was a cute story,'' he said. Only two floors of the virtual 
Moss building are occupied. If you click on the second floor, the 
doors close and the elevator lifts you to Kartell(AT)Moss, which features 
a display of Italian furniture by Kartell (some of which Moss also 
displays in the store.) For the virtual display, Ryan created animations 
out of photographs of the furniture that show qualities that cannot 
be easily displayed in the physical store. One animation, for example, 
shows a Kartell chair being assembled. Moss does not want the computer 
display to be a substitute for his actual displays. ``I want it to 
be an extension of the physical experience,'' he said. Moss said sales 
of Kartell furniture had doubled since he added the computer display. 
The fifth floor features designs by the Swiss furniture manufacturer 
Vitra. The remaining two floors are still vacant. Moss said he planned 
to open a digital art gallery on the third floor and to rent the fourth 
floor. Even though there is no limit to the number of virtual floors 
he can build, he said he would honor the neighborhood's very real 
zoning limit of five floors. ``Although,'' he added, ``I reserve the 
right to make each floor as big as I want.''
