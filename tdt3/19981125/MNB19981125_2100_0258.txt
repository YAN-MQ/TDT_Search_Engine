Actor Michael J. fox has revealed in an interview he was diagnosed 
with Parkinson's disease seven years ago and has been undergoing treatment, 
including experimental brain surgery. He's only 37 years old and as 
is the case with many celebrities, his illness will bring a lot of 
attention to Parkinson's. A report tonight from NBC news correspondent 
Robert Bazell. Michael J. fox was filming "doc Hollywood" in Florida 
in 1991 when he noticed a tremor in his pinky finger. It was revealed 
that he was suffering from Parkinson's disease. "People magazine" 
quotes him as saying -- Parkinson's disease, characterized by uncontrollable 
shaking or constantly stiffened muscles aplicts about 1 million Americans, 
including Muhammed Ali, Katharine Hepburn, Billy Graham, and Janet 
Reno reen. Usually it strikes older people. But 10% of the time it 
is diagnosed at age 40 or younger. Parkinson's has always affected 
young people but it wasn't appreciated before. In a few instances, 
Gene mutations or toxic chemicals can bring the disease on, but in 
the vast majority of cases, including fox's, no one knows what causes 
it. It begins in a part of the brain called substantia nigra. This 
leads to decreased production of dopamine, which controls muscle movement. 
Most Parkinson's patients can keep symptoms under control with medications 
that make up for the missing dopamine in the brain. It is not unusual 
for a patient to remain independent. Surgeons are trying experimental 
brain operations for people whose simp tops cannot be controlled by 
medications. Michael J. fox underwent such a surgery with good results. 
Sybil Guthrie volunteered for a surgery. Before surgeries, she was 
trembling constantly, unable to walk, afterwards -- Look at her! The 
early success of these surgeries offers grote hope for Michael J. 
fox and a million others with this affliction. Robert Bazell, NBC 
news, New York.
