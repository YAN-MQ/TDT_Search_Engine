Cambodia's new parliament has convened, formally ending a political 
deadlock that began after national elections in July. Hugh Watkin 
reports and updates us on this story. Prince Sihanouk won the powerful 
legislative post of assembly president with 105 votes from the 122-seat 
parliament. The prince was ousted as Cambodia's first prime minister 
in a bloody coup last year by his former coalition partner Hun Sen. 
Wednesday's vote was the result of an agreement by the prince to join 
a new coalition government with Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, 
the CPP. Under the agreement, Hun Sen becomes Cambodia's sole prime 
minister. After his election to the national assembly's presidency, 
Prince Sihanouk told reporters he would work hard to ensure the new 
government addressed the myriad social and economic problems facing 
Cambodia, one of Asia's poorest nations. He said he will fulfill his 
duty in bringing about true democracy, openness, and transparency 
by allowing all members of parliament to express their opinions openly. 
This is Hugh Watkin for VOA News, Phnom Penh.
