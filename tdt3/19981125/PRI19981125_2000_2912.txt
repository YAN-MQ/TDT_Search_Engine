Good evening to you. I'm Joe Pazudo Pamaco, and you're listening to 
THE WORLD on 91 FM, WHYY. Stay with us. We've got "Talk of the Nation" 
coming up at. You know there's a reason Las Vegas is nicknamed Sin 
City. There are few places you can legally gamble night and day, visit 
a prostitute, and get married by an Elvis impersonator. Well, we'll 
be talking about Las Vegas coming up in the 9:00 hour tonight on NPR's 
"Talk of the Nation." That's followed at by Ira Glass and "This American 
Life." It's a replay of a show we did last year on the tenth anniversary 
of Harold Washington's death. Washington, of course, the former mayor 
of Chicago. It's a parable of politics and race in America, and I 
hope you'll stay tuned. It's a very interesting and special program. 
That's at 10:00 tonight on "This American Life."
