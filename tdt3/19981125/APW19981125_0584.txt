Britain's largest-selling daily tabloid printed a front-page attack 
Wednesday on German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine for his push 
to harmonize Europe's economies and promote the single currency. Asking 
``Is this the most dangerous man in Europe?,'' The Sun filled its 
front page with a large picture of Lafontaine. And just to make sure 
no one missed its message, it teased, ``We spell it out for Germany 
on page 3,'' directing readers to a second copy of the front page 
written in German. The tabloid said it also was printing a special 
German-language edition and would circulate it in Germany. ``Most 
of us have never heard of this man,'' opined the tabloid, which is 
owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch, a fierce opponent of economic 
integration. ``His name is Oskar Lafontaine. And he is the biggest 
threat to the British way of life that we have seen since 1945.'' 
At a press conference later in Berlin, Lafontaine's spokesman Torsten 
Albig joked about the Sun's attack, noting that the tabloid had once 
printed a similar cover calling Prime Minister Tony Blair Britain's 
most dangerous man. ``He doesn't mind being put in the same category 
as Tony Blair,'' said Albig. The Sun attacked the nine-page ``policy 
agenda'' signed this weekend by finance ministers from 11 governments 
in the 15-nation European Union. The statement, which Lafontaine helped 
formulate, called for stronger policy coordination, making growth 
and job-creation the top economic priority. It also exhorted central 
banks to turn their attention from fighting inflation to creating 
jobs. The tabloid highlighted Lafontaine's support for tax harmonization 
across the European Union_ which British Treasury chief Gordon Brown 
has strongly rejected _ as a move to ``increase your taxes.'' The 
newspaper also warned against plans to scrap the pound in favor of 
the single European currency, the euro, which launches in 11 EU nations 
on Jan. 1. Blair says he is prepared to join the euro when it is in 
Britain's interest to do so, but has set no timetable. ``The Sun is 
not anti-German,'' the tabloid declared. ``Neither are we anti-European. 
... We want a free and proud Britain with its own currency and its 
own institutions working within a free European market.'' ``Despite 
what they want you to think, the euro is not inevitable,'' the tabloid 
said. ``All this claptrap is the invention of politicians, not the 
people. The people of Europe should rise up and resist this ridiculous 
charade.'' ``The people of Britain most definitely will,'' the newspaper 
promised. ``Just you wait and see, Oskar.''
