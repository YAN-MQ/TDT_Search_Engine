Michael J. fox revealed today he was suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
He was diagnosed seven years ago when he was only 30. Parkinson's 
most often affects older people. The average age of onset is 57. The 
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is believed to suffer from parkinson's. 
The Pope's tremor has been unmistakable for some time. Attorney general 
Janet Reno has Parkinson's. It is an incurable, though treatable, 
disorder of the central nervous system that stiffens the muscles, 
slows movement and produces tremors which get worse over time. Michael 
fox says his symptoms have become severe enough to affect his work 
on occasion, which basically means he gets tired. But more to the 
point, he leads a very active life which includes ice hockey. And 
he believes that by talking about Parkinson's he can help others. 
Many questions about this disease. So we turn to our medical correspondent, 
Dr. Tim Johnson. We're very struck by the fact that Michael fox is 
as young as he is, not common, right? Not common. Only about 5% of 
cases are diagnosed under age 40. Interestingly enough, when they 
are diagnosed at that age, the usual symptom is a tremor, which is 
what he has struggled with. You don't often see the full-blown symptoms 
at that age. Michael fox has had surgery. We have a little bit of 
video of surgery almost exactly that which he had. Can you explain 
what's happening as it goes along. I think what we'll see is the example 
of patients before and after a Procedure in which they go in -- before, 
here's obviously the after again. In these procedures they actually 
go into the brain and destroy a small part of the brain that is thought 
to be responsible for the symptoms. There are several different procedures. 
One is called a palladotomy. Michael fox had a thallidotomy. I should 
point out there are other treatments on the horizon. Even now some 
Gene therapy, the bottom line for most people is to take medication. 
Mr. fox is taking the most common medicine for this condition. Can 
he continue to be active under these conditions for this period of 
time? It's unpredictable. That clearly is the hope. Today with the 
new medicines and procedures, we think people can live long and productive 
lives. Thank you, Tim. Our medical editor up in Boston tonight.
