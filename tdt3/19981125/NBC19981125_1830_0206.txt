And while Kevorkian is campaigning for the right to die, tonight, 
a Boston couple knows the joy of a life reclaimed because of new equipment 
on some airplanes. The first documented American case of life saving 
in the air as a result of cardiac defibrillators. NBC's Fred Francis 
has that story. Mike tighe knows death. The 62-year-old, who works 
for the Boston public health commission, was actually dead for five 
minutes last week -- a victim of cardiac arrest. His wife Dolores, 
a nurse, could not save him with cpr. When I looked at him, he was 
dead. And all I felt was I was dying, too. But a portable defibrillator, 
soon to be on all American airlines jets, saved him by sending an 
electrical charge to his heart, jolting his heart back to life. They 
defibrillated him. He jolted. He started breathing again. It looked 
like he started to respond. Tighe became the first American saved 
with a defibrillator while in flight. I have deep faith now that such 
things as defibrillators being available are so important. Cardiac 
arrest -- electrical abnormalities in the heart causing it to stop 
pumping blood kills in ten minutes, 250,000 deaths a year. And a simple, 
$3,000 laptop computer-size defibrillator, according to experts, could 
save as many as 100,000 people annually. Training takes less than 
15 minutes. The machine tells you what to do. Shock delivered. These 
pads, when placed on the chest, read the electrical current, the chaos 
in the heart, and decide how much of a jolt is needed to take that 
heart out of its abnormal rhythm. The key is speed. So police departments 
like Seattle equip all their patrol cars. The goal, a defibrillator 
in the nation's 260,000 patrol cars. Also at sport stadiums, malls 
and amusement parks. Every airport and train station should have them. 
Bob Adams was saved at New York's grand central station. I was very 
fortunate. My family was very fortunate that they had an external 
defibrillator in this terminal because if they didn't, I wouldn't 
be standing here today. Industry experts say that if big companies 
and governments start buying now, they'll drive the price so low that 
in ten years everyone, including survivors like Mike tighe, will be 
able to have one at home. Fred Francis, NBC news, Washington.
