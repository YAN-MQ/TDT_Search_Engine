Parliament late Wednesday adopted a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting 
package meant to help the city-state ride out Asia's economic crisis 
by slashing the average Singaporean's income by at least 15 percent. 
The reductions in salaries, bonuses and pension payments, worth an 
estimated 7.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.6 billion) per year, 
are part of an overall revitalization program aimed at preserving 
jobs and regaining competitiveness. Community and business leaders 
have questioned why Singaporean workers must shoulder so much of the 
belt-tightening burden. But the 84-seat Parliament, dominated by the 
ruling People's Action Party and with only three opposition members, 
gave overwhelming support to the government proposal. ``When sacrifices 
are needed, Singaporeans will rally to the call,'' said Zainul Abidin 
Rasheed of the ruling PAP. Admitting that the cut will hurt, Zainul 
added that ``the alternative is even more painful.'' ``The cut will 
touch us all,'' agreed Simon Tay, a government-nominated member of 
Parliament. He warned that the package should not regarded as a ``magic 
bullet.'' ``It gives us breathing space, but only the regional recovery 
will restore real growth,'' Tay said. The average monthly pay in Singapore 
is about 2,500 Singapore dollars (dlrs 1,500). Recently, the government 
announced that the city-state is suffering a recession, its first 
in years. Effective Jan. 1, the legislation will reduce Singaporeans' 
take-home pay by 5 to 8 percent. It will also slash employers' contributions 
to the mandatory, state-run pension fund from 20 percent to 10 percent 
of a worker's salary, cutting the total income by at least 15 percent. 
The government had argued that the measures will curb unemployment, 
which has doubled to 4.5 percent, and restore Singapore's business 
competitiveness. Singapore government ministers, who are among the 
highest paid civil servants in the world, took the lead Tuesday by 
announcing a 20 percent reduction in their total wages. To cushion 
the blow, the government also offered some concessions, including 
an increased tax rebate, help for homeowners who have trouble meeting 
their mortgage obligations, cheaper public transport and lower hospital 
fees. Corporations will also enjoy a 10 percent tax rebate on 1998 
income, while a current commercial and industrial property tax rebate 
will be extended for another year.
