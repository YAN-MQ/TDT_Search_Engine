The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, says rebels in Sierra Leone have been 
intensifying their campaign of terror against civilians. The refugee 
agency says a particularly vicious attack took place recently against 
refugees who had returned home from Guinea to harvest their crops. 
Lisa Schlime has the story in Geneva. The U.N. refugee agency says 
five Sierra Leonean refugees had their hands cut off by rebels when 
they turned from Tomandu camp in Guinea to their home village to harvest 
their crops. UNHCR spokesman Paul Stromberg says the five were able 
to make their way back across the border to Guinea where they were 
taken to a hospital. He says the refugees told aid workers they had 
been with 15 other refugees who suffered similar atrocities, but, 
he says, the refugees do not know what happened to the other 15 who 
are still missing. This is the same kind of violence that we saw perpetrated 
against hundreds in Guinea alone, Sierra Leoneans, civilians, along 
with probably several thousand women and girls who had been the victim 
of rapes by these rebels still fighting the legitimate government 
in Sierra Leone. The U.N. refugee agency has registered nearly 500 
victims of mutilations in Guinea alone. Thousands of others have been 
registered in Sierra Leone. Mr. Stromberg says many refugee camps 
in Guinea are too close to the border with Sierra Leone. He says this 
invites cross-border attacks by the rebels. The UNHCR spokesman says 
the agency has been trying to move the camps farther away from the 
border, but he says this is a slow and difficult process, and he fears 
the problems might escalate. The rebels are obviously very desperate, 
have, in fact, been more violent recently after several of their leaders 
were sentenced to death or executed by authorities in Sierra Leone 
and, apparently, have begun an operation called "Spare No Living Soul." 
Mr. Stromberg says this highlights how atrocious the situation is 
for civilians in Sierra Leone. He says more than 200,000 Sierra Leoneans 
have fled into Guinea this year to escape the violence. Lisa Schlime
