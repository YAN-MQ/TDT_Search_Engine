European soccer's governing body Wednesday affirmed a season-long 
ban from European soccer imposed on Polish club Wisla Krakow over 
an alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA Cup match last month. 
The English Football Association also failed in its attempt to overturn 
a fine imposed over alleged racist chants from fans at a Sept. 5 match 
in Sweden. The Polish club's lawyer, Reinhard Rauball, who disclosed 
the decision by the UEFA appeals committee, said the rejection of 
the Krakow appeal was ``a sporting and a financial disaster'' for 
the club. Rauball said he didn't dispute the details of the Oct. 20 
incident, in which UEFA says AC Parma midfielder Dino Baggio was struck 
by a knife thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches to close 
a head wound. But he said the season-long ban was too severe and that 
it should be softened. ``The Appeals Body considered the Polish club 
responsible not only for the act of the spectator but also for the 
action of the TS Wisla Krakow player, Ryszard Czerwiec, who thre the 
knife back into the crowd in an attempt to conceal evidence,'' a UEFA 
statement said. Rauball noted that Krakow is 10 points clear at the 
top of the Polish league and expects to qualify for European cup competition 
next year. Being excluded will mean ``a very big financial loss'' 
because of the money in the European competition that the team cannot 
hope to match in Polish league play, he said. Rauball said he suggested 
a penalty on the first two home games, requiring that the first game 
be played elsewhere in Poland and the second in another country. UEFA 
imposed the ban because it said Krakow's security should have stopped 
the knife being brought into the stadium, but Rauball said security 
had been very good. Polish police have detained a 19-year-old man 
over the incident. Rauball noted that there were similarities to the 
banning of the Italian club Fiorentina over an explosive device thrown 
by a fan, but that Krakow should have been treated more leniently 
since it was the club's first such offense. The club will be banned 
from the next UEFA competition in the next five years for which it 
qualifies due to the ``reprehensible act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' 
the original decision said. Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of 
the second-round, first-leg match. The teams tied 1-1. Parma won the 
second game 2-1 at home to advance 3-2 on aggregate. The appeals panel 
also rejected an appeal by England against a fine of 60,000 Swiss 
francs (about dlrs 45,000) for supporters' behavior during the team's 
match in Sweden. UEFA said evidence from match referee Pierluigi Collina 
and the UEFA delegate Matthieu Sprengers stressed that on at least 
eight occasions during the game English fans directed racist chants 
at Swedish player Henrik Larsson. Larsson, whose father is from the 
Cape Verdi islands and whose mother is Swedish, is considered to be 
Sweden's top player. He plays for Scottish team Celtic FC. Nick Coward, 
lawyer for the English Football Association, said the association 
had denied that there was racist chanting, but it accepted UEFA's 
decision. ``Whilst we're disappointed as we still believe that everything 
is done within English football to eradicate racism from the game, 
this does nothing more than strengthen our resolve,'' said Coward. 
He said it wasn't specified what was said by the fans, only that they 
engaged in ``monkey chanting.'' Sweden beat England, 2-1, in the match, 
which was their opening qualifier for the European Championships in 
2000.
