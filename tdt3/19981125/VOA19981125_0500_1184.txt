The NHL has escalated its war on excessive violence in the sport by 
suspending Los Angeles Kings enforcer Matt Johnson for 12 games without 
pay. Johnson was suspended by the league Monday after he sucker punched 
New York Rangers defenseman Jeff Beukeboom in the their game last 
Thursday. The suspension is tied for the seventh longest in league 
history. Beukeboom is still suffering from headaches and dizziness 
in the aftermath of the attack.
