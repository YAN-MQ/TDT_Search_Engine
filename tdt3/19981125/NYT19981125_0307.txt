Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is ready to bring his former foreign 
minister, David Levy, back into his Cabinet in an effort to shore 
up his disintegrating coalition and to fortify his chances at either 
re-election or assembling a unity government. Levy, a political moderate 
who resigned in January after denouncing the Netanyahu administration 
as aimless, said Wednesday that he would return, though the terms 
are still in negotiation. A veteran of Israeli politics, Levy has 
been offered either the Finance Ministry or the National Infrastructures 
Ministry, a place in the inner circle, a role in the ``final status'' 
talks with the Palestinians and a chance to lead future negotiations 
with Syria. Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon both canceled 
trips abroad Wednesday to concentrate on stabilizing the deeply divided 
government. Since the prime minister signed a land-for-security accord 
with the Palestinians last month, his right-wing coalition has been 
in a shambles. ``I always said I wanted to widen the base of the government,'' 
Netanyahu said Wednesday. ``It should reflect the wide support which 
our policy has in the Israeli public.'' Although polls have shown 
that Israelis broadly endorse the peace effort, the Cabinet majority 
that ratified the peace deal was shaky and the accord passed Parliament 
only because of opposition support. Now Netanyahu is marshaling his 
resources to clear a serious political hurdle next month _ the always-contentious 
budget vote. It was after the last budget vote that Levy quit, scathing 
in his denunciation of a ``government on a flight to nowhere.'' In 
addition to criticizing what he saw as a lack of social spending, 
Levy said he was disgusted by the stalemate in the peace effort. Now 
Levy says he believes the government is ``returning to a right path.'' 
``Today there is a diplomatic process in full swing,'' he said. ``And 
there is a readiness to make the required adjustments in the budget 
regarding social issues.'' Political associates say Levy felt politically 
sidelined and saw no future for his small party, Gesher. The party 
broke away from Likud in 1992 to concentrate on social issues, which 
the major parties, focused on the peace effort, had tended to ignore. 
Born in Morocco, Levy tried to court Sephardic voters, but they were 
drawn instead by Shas, the third-largest party, which wooed them with 
free nursery schools, social services and rabbis' blessings. Levy 
was said to have felt particularly depressed after the municipal elections 
two weeks ago, when his son lost the mayoral election in the immigrant 
town where Levy began his political career. ``Despair is what is returning 
Levy to Netanyahu,'' said Nahum Barnea, a seasoned political observer 
for the newspaper Yediot Ahronoth. ``Levy understands that his movement 
does not have an electoral future.'' With Levy rejoining the government, 
Gesher would return to the coalition, adding four votes to the prime 
minister's razor-thin majority in the parliament. It would likely 
merge back into Likud as well. The prime minister has reportedly offered 
to add 500 Gesher representatives to Likud's 2,700-member central 
committee, giving Gesher a significant voice in choosing candidates 
for parliamentary elections. But Likud leaders are balking. ``There's 
no point in preserving Gesher,'' said Communications Minister Limor 
Livnat. ``That's not what Likud exists for.'' Since Netanyahu returned 
from Washington with a peace agreement, he has been scrambling to 
hold his coalition together. Political experts agree that his government 
will not survive its term, which was supposed to last until the end 
of 2000. But whether there will be early elections or a unity government 
formed with the center-left opposition is a matter of intense debate. 
By bringing Levy into his government, Netanyahu is trying to prevent 
him from joining a centrist bloc that could draw votes from him. Netanyahu 
also seems to be taking a preparatory step toward a unity government. 
Many say Netanyahu needs a unity government not only to survive but 
to carry off the thorny ``final status'' talks with the Palestinians. 
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman offered Wednesday to step down so his 
ministry could be taken by Levy or another opposition figure. The 
Infrastructures Ministry would be vacated by Sharon, who continued 
as its head after he took over the Foreign Ministry in October. In 
the last week, Sharon has been arguing publicly for a unity government, 
working to fold another small party, Tsomet, into Likud too. But Wednesday, 
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak reiterated his rejection of that idea, 
calling for early elections instead.
