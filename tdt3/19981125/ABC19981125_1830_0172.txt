We'll go overseas today. In London today, an unexpected setback for 
the former military ruler of chile. Britain's highest court has ruled 
that augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest. General 
Pinochet has long been held responsible for the murder and disappearance 
of thousands of people during the nearly 20 years he ruled in chile. 
A prosecutor in Spain has charged him with murdering of Spanish citizens 
and Spain wants to put him on trial. Here's ABC's Richard Gizbert. 
The conventional, legal wisdom was that this was probably general 
pinochet's last day of detention at his London hospital. It was his 
83rd birthday, someone sent him some cake. Pinochet had a plane standing 
by to take him home. Even Pinochet's enemies felt he would win. Luis 
munoz was tortured by the regime. His wife is still missing. My feeling 
is like it's going to go in Pinochet's favor. The ruling, from the 
five so-called law lords, the country's Supreme Court. Britain was 
deciding today whether former heads of state are above prosecution 
for crimes against their own people. The first four judges were split, 
two for, two against. The fifth broke the tie. Senator Pinochet has 
no immunity from prosecution. Today is a historic moment for the people 
of Chile, for the people of britain, for the people of Latin America 
and for all the people of the world, because finally, justice has 
been done. In Chile, there was joy among Pinochet's opponents, and 
anger from his many supporters. Lawyers say today's ruling puts dictators 
everywhere on notice. If you are accused of doing absolutely outrageous 
things, then you can expect to be held to account for those outrageous 
things. Britain can still make a political decision to overturn today's 
court ruling, but that is considered unlikely. Today wasn't general 
Pinochet's last chance to escape prosecution, but it was his best 
chance. Richard Gizbert, ABC News, London.
