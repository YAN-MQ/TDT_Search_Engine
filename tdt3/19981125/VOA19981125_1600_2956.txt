Well, we had a modestly up day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
closing at 9,314. That was up 13 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 
Index closed at 1,186, up 4 points. And NASDAQ was ahead by 19. Well, 
although stocks did close higher, analysts say there wasn't too much 
conviction of traders, many of whom seemed more interested in leaving 
work early than trading stocks today. The U.S. financial markets will 
be closed tomorrow, Thursday, for the Thanksgiving holiday. Analysts 
say it may be Monday before a clear direction for stock prices is 
determined.
