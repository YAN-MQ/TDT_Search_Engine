SPAR, which handles one of Germany's largest food retailers, says 
it bought 50 percent of distribution company Eimkauf so it can sell 
groceries over the Internet and by fax and phone. Bloomberg Business 
News reports the new service is so far restricted to the Hamburg area 
where Spar is headquartered. It allows customers to place orders for 
receipt the same day. Spar is the second German retailer this week 
to unveil an Internet shopping strategy as companies seek out alternative 
methods of lifting sales. Kaufhalle Varenhause said Tuesday it plans 
to sell food over the Internet.
