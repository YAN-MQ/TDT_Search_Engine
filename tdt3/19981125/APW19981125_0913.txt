The long-awaited dismantling of the Brent Spar offshore oil storage 
buoy began Wednesday, 3 1/2 years after Greenpeace activists boarded 
the unit and embarrassed oil giant Shell into dropping plans to sink 
it in the North Atlantic. Instead, Brent Spar was towed to the deep 
waters of the Norwegian Erfjord inlet to be dismantled and reused, 
partly as the foundation for a new wharf. The first major step is 
to remove the buoy's 1,600 ton topside with a floating crane. ``We 
have at least 800 tons on the hook. It's exciting,'' the project's 
senior engineer Arvid Nygaard told The Associated Press from the crane 
barge, as the lift of the topside started Wednesday afternoon. He 
said the lift would take a few hours. ``We have been very lucky with 
the weather,'' he added. Nygaard said the weather was calm, with no 
rain or snow, making ideal conditions to start the lift. The process 
of dismantling the 15,000 ton unit is estimated to last a year. Shell 
UK had planned to sink the obsolete Brent Spar off Scotland, a cheaper 
and faster approach. But Greenpeace activists boarded the vessel in 
April 1995 in a successful protest that lasted four months and gained 
backing across Europe. ``Off course, this is a good feeling,'' said 
Jan Rispens, a Dutch Greenpeace activist who spent 2 1/2 weeks aboard 
the Brent Spar during the protest. He was in western Norway to see 
the dismantling begin, a step he called a victory for the millions 
of people who supported the anti dumping campaign. ``This is the best 
solution. It reuses materials; it provides jobs in Norway, and it 
protects the ocean,'' he said. Opponents feared that sinking the North 
Sea platform would pollute the ocean with chemicals and other pollutants. 
But, in May 1996, a British government commission concluded that scuttling 
the Brent Spar in the North Atlantic would have a minimal environmental 
impact. The tube-like Brent Spar will float upright, and be slowly 
sliced into sections as it is lifted out of the water. The sections 
will be cleaned, and then towed to the new wharf. In January, Shell 
awarded Norway's Maritime GMC AS and Scotland's Wood Group Engineering 
a joint contract to dispose of the platform. Shell has said the disposal 
of Brent Spar will cost the company up to 26 million pounds (dlrs 
42 million), more than twice the cost of sinking it.
