Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic fired the head of the country's 
army, Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic, following months of rumors 
that the two disagreed on many government policies, including the 
handling of the crisis in Kosovo. A terse release carried by state-run 
Tanjug news agency late Tuesday said Perisic's erstwhile deputy, Gen. 
Lt. Dragoljub Ojdanic would be new chief of staff, while Perisic would 
become defense advisor to Milosevic, a high but not executive position. 
It did not elaborate on the change. This is the fourth major shake-down 
at the top of Yugoslavia's establishment in as many weeks. Perisic 
held many command positions, including leading the army, throughout 
the early 1990's when the former Yugoslavia began disintegrating. 
Perisic was appointed Chief of Staff in 1993, after serving as a commander 
of Serb forces fighting the Croats in 1991. From the beginning, Perisic 
had a reputation for occasionally opposing some of the Yugoslav president's 
iron-fist moves. Recently, he subtly criticized Milosevic's policy 
in Kosovo, the Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are fighting 
for independence, saying the conflict was partly the result of ``certain 
politicians' wish to stay in power.'' Although he never commented 
specifically on political issues, Perisic was believed to be intent 
on keeping the army as neutral as possible in Kosovo. Perisic has 
also maintained ties with Milosevic's foe, Milo Djukanovic, president 
of Montenegro. At Tuesday's session of the Supreme Defense Council, 
the five-member decision-making body for top defense issues, Djukanovic 
voted against replacing Perisic, media in Montenegro reported. The 
chief of staff's dismissal comes a month after Gen. Lt. Ljubisa Velickovic 
stepped down as commander of the air force to become deputy defense 
minister, following rumors of a rift with Milosevic. Earlier this 
month, Milosevic also fired his state security chief, Jovica Stanisic 
and a top official of his Socialist party, Milorad Vucelic.
