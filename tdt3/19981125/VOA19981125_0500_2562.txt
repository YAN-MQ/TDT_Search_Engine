Britain's high court will make its decision today whether Britain 
should extradite a former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain 
to face charges of genocide. The five-member panel from the House 
of Lords is ruling if Mr. Pinochet is entitled to diplomatic immunity 
for any crimes committed while serving as a head of state. If the 
House of Lords rules against his arrest, General Pinochet could be 
allowed to return home.
