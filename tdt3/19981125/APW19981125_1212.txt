Benfica of Portugal beat Germany's Kaiserslautern 2-1 Wednesday in 
the European Champions League to keep alive its slim hope of advancing 
in the competition. The Lisbon team's second win in five games in 
Group F lifted it into second place on seven points, three points 
behind the German club with one rotation left to play. Karel Poborsky 
set up the goals in each half at the Stadium of Light. He broke down 
the right on the halfhour, beating one defender before crossing into 
the heart of the German area where Gomes snuck between to defenders 
to head neatly past Andreas Reinke. In the thrilling second half, 
when Benfica dictated the run of play, Poborsky once more charged 
down the right and pulled the ball back for Joao Pinto in the area. 
Pinto dribbled around a defender before slotting the ball past keeper 
Andreas Reinke after 70 minutes. Juergen Rische pulled one back with 
a header in the 90th minute. Kaiserslautern persistently probed down 
Benfica's flanks in the first half in pursuit of the win that would 
have secured it a berth in the next round. Marco Reich tested goalie 
Sergey Ovchinikov with a thundering shot after 15 minutes, while Michael 
Ballack twice came close with shots in the 30th and 33rd minutes. 
After the interval, Gomes had a superb chance to notch his second 
when he pierced the German back line and, chased by three defenders, 
ran half the pitch but shot straight at Reinke from almost point blank 
range. Olaf Marschall came closest for Kaiserslautern, chipping cleverly 
over Ovchinikov from the edge of the area but the Russian tipped the 
ball over the bar. In the final minutes, Pinto shot the ball wide 
from close range when he had only the goalie to beat.
