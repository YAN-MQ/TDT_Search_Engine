The U.N. security council says it stands 100% behind its weapons inspectors 
in Iraq, but it's having trouble formulating a response to the latest 
impasse. It issued a one-line statement after a three-hour meeting 
in New York last night. Chief inspector Richard Butler updated council 
members on his efforts to obtain important Iraqi documents. Iraq is 
still refusing to turn over the papers. In yesterday's meeting, both 
Russia and China pressed Butler to explain how he knows those documents 
exist. Iraq recently claimed they don't.
