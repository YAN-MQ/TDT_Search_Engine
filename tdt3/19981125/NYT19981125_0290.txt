Indians were in a sour mood Wednesday as they voted in elections that 
are most likely to weaken further the wobbly Hindu nationalist-led 
coalition that came to power this year. Voters complained about soaring 
vegetable prices, crime and endemic corruption as they left the polling 
booths. ``We're poor,'' said Lila Kumari, 48, who supports herself 
and her elderly mother on her meager earnings from sewing sleeves 
onto shirts. ``How can we eat?'' Election officials will not begin 
counting the millions of votes cast in the capital territory of Delhi 
and the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram until Saturday. 
But exit polls conducted for the government-financed television station 
found that Hindu nationalist governments in Delhi and Rajasthan were 
being swept from power by the Congress Party, which has governed India 
for most of its 51-year history as an independent nation. In Madhya 
Pradesh, a large central state that Congress controls, exit polling 
showed the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party with a 2 percent 
lead. Polling experts said the margin of error made it difficult to 
know the outcome until the votes had been counted. In Mizoram, a tiny 
northeastern state, Congress was losing to a regional party. Political 
analysts said the loss of its strongholds in Delhi and Rajasthan would 
be a serious blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party. At a minimum the 
voting is likely to make some of the party's partners nervous about 
how inflation will affect their prospects, and more likely to bolt 
the coalition. In that event, a no-confidence vote is possible when 
Parliament convenes next week. This election was the first since the 
Bharatiya Janata Party won power at the national level in May. It 
is also the first test of the Congress Party's popularity since Sonia 
Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of the assassinated former prime minister, 
Rajiv Gandhi, became president of the party. For weeks Bharatiya Janata 
candidates, and their star campaigner, Prime Minister Atal Behari 
Vajpayee, tried to change the prime topic of political conversation 
from the price of onions, which has skyrocketed. Vajpayee often bragged 
about the nuclear tests in May that made India an atomic power. But 
most voters did not seem to care much. He also attacked what he described 
as the long history of misrule and corruption in the Congress Party. 
But voters had more immediate everyday concerns. In the closing days 
of the campaign the Hindu nationalists tried to meet the issue of 
inflation head on. ``We know you paid a price for onions for some 
days,'' their newspaper advertisements stated two days before the 
vote. ``But the price you will pay for a corrupt government is far 
higher.'' At rallies the candidate for chief minister in Delhi, Shushma 
Swaraj, reminded voters that she had sought to bring down prices with 
emergency airlifts of onions from the Middle East. But Wednesday night 
in an interview on television and with defeat apparently closing in, 
she faulted the Congress Party for the tone of the campaign. ``This 
was a Congress ploy to make this whole election about the price of 
onions, ignoring all other relevant issues,'' Ms. Swaraj said. The 
Hindu nationalists won the leadership of an 18-party coalition this 
year with a promise to deliver effective government. They have paid 
heavily for the perception that basic water and electrical services 
have deteriorated, even as vegetable prices have gone through the 
roof. Most voters interviewed as they emerged from the polling booths 
said ``price rise'' when asked to name the most important issue. Triloki 
Chand, 23, an auto rickshaw driver, went to the polls with his wife, 
Lila Wati, 21, and their 3-year-old. ``Last time we voted for the 
BJP,'' Chand said, ``and prices rose too high. I thought, `Let's try 
the other party.''' But his wife decided to stick with the Bharatiya 
Janata Party, voicing the common theme that politicians are not to 
be trusted. ``All the parties are filling their own pockets, not thinking 
of the people'' Mrs. Wati said. ``It doesn't matter whether the BJP 
or Congress is in power.''
