I'm Robert Burns, VOA News. Britain's highest court has ruled that 
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from 
prosecution for crimes committed while he was head of state. VOA Correspondent 
Laurie Kassman reports from London. One by one, the judges announced 
their decision. It was not until the last of the five pronounced his 
own ruling that former General Augusto Pinochet's fate was sealed. 
I agree with them that Senator Pinochet does not have immunity from 
prosecution, and I, too, would, therefore, allow the appeal. The appeal 
overturns a lower court ruling that said Mr. Pinochet was immune from 
Spain's extradition request as a former head of state. Now Mr. Pinochet 
will remain in Britain and fight extradition to Spain on charges of 
human rights abuses during his 17-year rule in Chile. Laurie Kassman, 
VOA News, London. Anti-Pinochet protesters outside the British parliament 
and in Santiago, Chile, broke out in cheers of joy following the verdict. 
Human rights groups are declaring justice. Pinochet supporters are 
expressing shock and disappointment.
