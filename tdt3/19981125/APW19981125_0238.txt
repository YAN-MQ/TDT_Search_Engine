The fight against doping in sports got a million-dollar boost from 
the White House. In an unprecedented action, U.S. drug czar Barry 
McCaffrey pledged dlrs 1 million in federal funding Tuesday for research 
to cleanse Olympic sports of all banned substances, from marijuana 
to anabolic steroids. McCaffrey also called on the International Olympic 
Committee to set up an independent anti-drug office, award medals 
to athletes cheated by doping and insist that every Olympic sport 
use and enforce the same drug rules year-round. The time is long past 
for the current ``cat and mouse game'' of sporadic, ineffectual drug 
tests, the White House official said. ``The prevailing belief that 
a large number of elite athletes are doping causes athletes to believe 
that they cannot win without cheating,'' he said. ``The common belief 
of widespread doping also detracts from how the public perceives the 
games and medal performances. A cynicism now envelopes every great 
victory.'' In a 10-page memo to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, 
McCaffrey called for education and prevention programs to make doping 
as ``reviled as any other form of cheating. ... The goal of this whole 
effort must be to prevent Olympic medals and the Olympic movement 
from being tarnished by drugs.'' The plan was submitted as part of 
planning for a worldwide drug summit called by the IOC for Feb. 2-4. 
McCaffrey will head the U.S. government delegation to that meeting. 
While it spends millions of dollars to fight drug abuse each year, 
the White House never before has committed anywhere near dlrs 1 million 
to battle doping in sports. The U.S. Olympic Committee, which budgets 
more than dlrs 11 million in its own anti-drug efforts, praised McCaffrey's 
stand. ``We're enthusiastic about the participation and the financial 
commitment of the U.S. government in the international fight against 
drugs in sports,'' USOC president Bill Hybl said. ``Having the strong 
commitment of the executive branch is a forceful enhancement of the 
USOC's efforts to detect and eradicate doping.'' Hybl last month asked 
Samaranch to award duplicate gold medals to the U.S. women's 400-meter 
medley swim relay team from the 1976 Summer Games, which finished 
second to East Germany. Recent German court cases have revealed that 
one member of the gold-medal relay squad had been helped by anabolic 
steroids administered secretly by her coach. McCaffrey wants to expand 
the USOC request. ``The IOC needs to reward medals to those drug-free 
athletes _ not just Americans but all international athletes _ who 
were deprived of their medals,'' he said. Although the proposal specifically 
mentions only German athletes, a spokesman for McCaffrey said that 
could be broadened to any drug cases. ``We wanted the door opened,'' 
spokesman Bob Weiner said. The dlrs 1 million research program would 
be administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, working 
on its own initiatives and on requests from Olympic authorities. ``We 
will work in consultation with the IOC and the USOC,'' Weiner said.
