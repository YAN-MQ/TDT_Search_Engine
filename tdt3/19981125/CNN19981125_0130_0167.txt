Representative Paul McHale has introduced a draft resolution to censure 
President Clinton as an alternative to impeachment. McHale is not 
on the house Judiciary committee, but committee member william Delahunt 
says he, too, will offer a resolution of censure. Committee chairman 
Henry Hyde has tentatively set the week of December 7th for debate 
on impeachment and other proposals. House minority leader Richard 
Gephardt says the censure proposals are being made too early in the 
process. We shouldn't prejudge this. We ought to really wait and see 
what the committee comes up with. I do think it would be good to get 
it over with this year and not drag it into next year.
