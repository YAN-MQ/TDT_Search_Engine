Along with Willie Nelson, singer Jerry Jeff Walker is one of the founders 
of progressive or outlaw country music, music that's closer to its 
bluegrass roots and rock-and-roll offshoots than mainstream country. 
The movement also chose a different home, not Nashville, Tennessee, 
but Austin, Texas. Caroline Weaver was in Austin earlier this fall 
and talked with Jerry Jeff Walker. I just make my music for my fans 
and me. I mean, I make it for me, and the fans like it. I guess that's 
what ties us together. At 56, Jerry Jeff Walker still tours at least 
half the month, racking up 120-plus concerts annually with his three-man 
band, the Gonzo Compadres. Concerts are what enable him to maintain 
his fan base, the 40,000 or so people on his Internet mailing list 
who buy almost every one of his records. Jerry Jeff Walker is best 
known for his song "Mr. Bojangles," but his ardent, often rowdy audiences 
like the songs about his partying days, like "Sangria Wine." When 
friends come for Saturday night / It's nice to make Some sangria wine 
/ It's organic and it comes from the vine / It's also legal and it 
gets you high / Yeah, I love that Sangria wine / When I'm drinking 
with old friends of mine... Last spring, Jerry Jeff Walker released 
his 30th record, the 11th on his own independent label Tried & True 
Records which he started in 1986 after being dropped by his major 
label. He says he never sought a recording contract anyway. I already 
made the records for the companies. I always was independent. I recorded 
them. I mixed them. I did the photos. I did the cover. I wrote the 
line of notes. Well, let me eat the pie. So, basically, then it wasn't 
that hard for me to do that for my own company. I knew how to do that. 
Jerry Jeff Walker grew up in upstate New York farm country and, after 
high school, left it to hitchhike around the country with his guitar, 
like his folk music heroes. He also dropped his birth name Ronald 
Clyde Crosby for the more stylish moniker Jerry Jeff. Even his oldest 
friends call him J.J. now. For many years, he and his wife Susan lived 
in a house in the hills outside Austin. They moved into town a few 
years ago when their two children were in high school. Leaving their 
country house was the inspiration for the song, "Long Old Dusty Road," 
on Walker's 1996 album "Scamp." It seemed like only yesterday / We 
first drove up that road / Looking back / I see it's more like 20-odd 
years ago / We were young and so in live / With a long, long road 
to hoe / We came and went / Our lives were spent / Up a long old dusty 
road... Our kids always wondered why our house always had to be at 
the end of a long, old, dusty, bumpy road. We never had a clean car. 
When we first got married / We searched to find a home / We found 
one at the end / Of a long old dusty road / We fixed it up with love 
/ And watched our children grow / The years flew by / When we lived 
our lives / Up a long old dusty road... I had a real-estate agent 
tell me one time the thing you're supposed to do is sell your house 
every 4.5 years, earn a profit, and move on. I thought, "Uhm? How 
callous?" I thought you got it and filled it with as much love and 
junk and stuff as you could and made it yours. Although mainstream 
country music radio stations almost never play music by singers like 
Jerry Jeff Walker -- it's deemed not commercial enough -- his recent 
records have done well on stations that are following the new Americana 
format. One fan is President Clinton who invited Jerry Jeff Walker 
to play at his first inauguration, and he's since gone out to hear 
him play when he tours near Washington. Jerry Jeff Walker's records 
are jointly released by Tried & True Music and RYKO Disc. I'm Caroline 
Weaver. And the first home that you ever own / Is where all those 
memories start / And it always holds a special place / Deep inside 
your heart / And came the day we faced the facts / Our kids had grown 
/ Seen our little family just outgrow our home / I didn't believe 
we'd leave the hilltop we loved so / But there comes a time when you 
say goodbye / To the long old dusty road / Because a home is where 
you dream your dreams / It's where all...
