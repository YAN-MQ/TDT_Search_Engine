The Clinton administration's National Security team met today to discuss 
the status of Iraq's compliance with United Nations weapons inspectors. 
New inspection teams are expected to arrive in Iraq in the coming 
days. NPR's Peter Kenyan reports. The meeting was hosted by President 
Clinton's National Security adviser Sandy Berger and included Secretary 
of State Albright, Defense Secretary Cohen, and director of Central 
Intelligence, George Tenet. NSC spokesman David Levy says it was not 
a decision meeting, but the officials wanted to review the situation. 
President Clinton came within minutes of launching air strikes against 
Iraq earlier this month but held off when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 
agreed to allow U.N. weapons inspectors full access to potential weapon 
sites. Tensions escalated again when Iraq refused to turn over documents 
demanded by the inspectors. Officials have said that refusal alone 
may not be enough to trigger an air strike, since otherwise Iraq has 
cooperated with the searches. But new U.N. teams are headed to Baghdad 
in a few days with an eye toward inspecting previously unseen locations. 
The U.S. will be watching to see whether those demands are met. Peter 
Kenyan, NPR News, Washington.
