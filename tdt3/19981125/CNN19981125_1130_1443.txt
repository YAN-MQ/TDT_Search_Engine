An American fitness expert is claiming a new world's record. Kurek 
Ashley hotfooted his way over 92 yards of burning coals at a show 
ground in Brisbane, Australia. The old record was 54 yards. Ashley 
is a personal fitness trainee to a number of Hollywood stars. He cautions 
that only professional fire walkers should take on the world record, 
and says he'd be horrified to think of anyone trying this at home.
