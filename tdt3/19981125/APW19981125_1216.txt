Substitute Josip Simic scored with a delightful lob over Edwin van 
der Sar to give Croatia Zagreb a surprise 1-0 victory over Ajax Amsterdam 
Wednesday in their Champions League Group A clash. Playing without 
star Robert Prosinecki, Zagreb created few chances but made the most 
of its first clear opening to steal the match. Simic scored his opportunist 
goal in the 68th minute when Van der Sar lost the ball after charging 
off his line to break down a Zagreb attack but lost the ball. With 
the 'keeper stranded, Simic fired a perfectly-judged 25-meter (yard) 
lob into the empty net. Ajax dominated possession throughout the match 
but was unable to convert its ball control into meaningful attacks 
as the Croatians defended resolutely. The closest four-times European 
Cup winner Ajax came to opening the scoring was in the last minute 
before half time when Richard Witschge's cross from the right was 
headed across the face of the goal by Dani but 19-year-old Brutil 
Hose, making his European debut, was beaten to the ball by defender 
Goran Juric. The home team had the ball in the net in the 32nd minute 
when Wamberto volleyed in from close range after a Ronald de Boer 
corner but French referee Marc Batta ruled that Zagreb goalkeeper 
Drazen Ladic had been fouled. Zagreb came close to scoring in the 
54th minute when Silvio Maric released Simic but Simic, who had come 
on as a substitute seconds earlier, was this time defied by Van der 
Sar who quickly came off his line to clear the danger.
