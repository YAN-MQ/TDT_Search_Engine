If competence and integrity were the keys to survival, the criminal 
justice system in Austin, Texas, would have passed out of existence 
by now. From the very beginning the case against Lacresha Murray was 
an exercise in incompetence and bad faith. The system ganged up on 
an 11-year-old girl and imprisoned her for a crime of which she is 
almost certainly innocent _ the fatal beating of 2{-year-old Jayla 
Belton. Lacresha is spending Thanksgiving at the Giddings State Home 
and School, a juvenile prison 60 miles east of Austin where she has 
begun to serve a sentence of 25 years. To this day the authorities 
in Austin deny that Lacresha was in police custody two years ago when, 
without her family's knowledge and without the benefit of a lawyer, 
she was interrogated by detectives for at least three hours about 
Jayla's death. At the end of that tape-recorded interrogation, Detective 
Sgt. Ernesto Pedraza gave her a statement to sign, a statement she 
had trouble reading and clearly did not understand. ``That's all true 
and correct,'' said Pedraza. ``Am I forcing you to sign that?'' Lacresha 
replied, ``Yeah.'' That, of course, was the wrong answer. Pedraza, 
unhappy, said, quite forcefully, ``Wha--?'' Lacresha got the message. 
``No,'' she said. Pedraza then said, ``OK, you're doing this voluntarily.'' 
No one wants to admit that Lacresha was in custody because under Texas 
law a child who is alone in the custody of the police must be taken 
before a magistrate to insure that the child's rights are protected, 
and that the child understands the proceedings that are taking place 
and the penalties that might ensue. Lacresha had no clue as to what 
was going on. After she signed the statement, she was charged with 
capital murder. Eleven years old! Even in Texas you can't execute 
somebody that young. But you can charge a child with capital murder, 
and that's what the authorities did to Lacresha. For her first trial, 
held just two months after she was charged (which is equivalent to 
the speed of light in a capital murder case), the public defender 
was given a pittance with which to mount a defense. Lacresha was promptly 
convicted of criminally negligent homicide and intentional injury 
to a child. She was sentenced to 20 years. Then something unusual 
happened. When an appeals lawyer asked the trial judge to throw out 
the verdict, the request was granted and a new trial was ordered. 
The judge, John Dietz, told me in an interview, ``I had a question 
as to whether justice was done.'' Substantially more money was provided 
to the defense for the second trial. There were still no witnesses 
contending that Lacresha had attacked Jayla. There was no physical 
evidence connecting her to the child's death, and no motive. And now 
there were experts ready to testify that Jayla's death had been the 
result of long-term physical abuse and neglect. If the prosecution 
had been interested in justice, it would have dropped the case against 
Lacresha and investigators would have been assigned to track down 
whoever had been abusing Jayla. Common sense says that investigation 
should start with Jayla's mother, Judy Belton, and her boyfriend, 
Derrick Shaw. But the prosecution was interested in saving face in 
this high-profile case. And that could only be done by sending Lacresha 
to prison for a long, long time. Worried that it would be unable to 
secure another guilty verdict on homicide charges, the Travis County 
District Attorney's office decided at the last minute to pursue only 
the charge of intentional injury to a child. For a juvenile in Texas, 
that charge carries the same maximum penalty upon conviction as capital 
murder _ 40 years' imprisonment. It was an unconscionable but very 
clever move. All references to the death of Jayla Belton were removed 
from the prosecution's pleadings. It was as if, from the prosecutor's 
point of view, a homicide had never happened. Lacresha was accused 
technically of causing ``bodily injuries that created a substantial 
risk of death,'' when in reality she was on trial for killing a young 
child. The jury returned a guilty verdict and Lacresha was sentenced 
to 25 years. The system ganged up on an 11-year-old girl, and the 
system won.
