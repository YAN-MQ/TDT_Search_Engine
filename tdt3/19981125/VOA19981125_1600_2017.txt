Assisted suicide doctor Jack Kevorkian has been charged with murder 
and violating the U.S. State of Michigan's ban on assisted suicide. 
The charges followed a nationwide telecast this past Sunday of Dr. 
Kevorkian euthanizing a terminally ill man. More from VOA's Michael 
Leland. Dr. Kevorkian says he gave a videotape of the euthanasia to 
the CBS television network to challenge Michigan prosecutors to file 
charges against him and settle the issue of assisted suicide once 
and for all. On Wednesday, Oakland County prosecutor David Gorcyca 
gave the doctor what he wanted. Notwithstanding public sentiment on 
the issue of assisted suicide, it is incumbent upon me to make charging 
decisions based solely upon the law and not emotion or sympathy. In 
this case, there is an obvious violation of the law that I will not 
turn my back to. Dr. Kevorkian's charged with first-degree murder, 
assisting in a suicide, and delivering a controlled substance. It 
will be the first test of Michigan's latest ban on assisted suicide 
which went into effect in September. Michael Leland, VOA News, Chicago.
