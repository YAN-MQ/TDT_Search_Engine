Now to Mexico city where a volcano, just 40 miles outside of the capital, 
has come to life. They call it pocco. A plume of ash shot more than 
two miles into the air and large rocks tumbled down the slopes of 
the volcano. But, despite the pyrotechnics, officials say there is 
no immediate risk to the small towns around the volcano.
