A farmer in southwest China has been sentenced to 20 years in prison 
for killing giant pandas, selling their pelts and injuring a policeman, 
the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday. The Higher People's 
Court of Sichuan province, which issued the sentence Tuesday, also 
ordered Tang Xianlin to pay 3,000 yuan (dlrs 360) in fines, the report 
said. It said Tang had killed or helped poach three giant pandas in 
the mountains near his Pingwu County home and in a nearby nature reserve. 
He sold their skins for prices ranging from 5,000 to 14,000 yuan (dlrs 
600 to dlrs 1,680). While resisting arrest in 1995, Tang stabbed and 
seriously wounded a policeman, the report said. The giant panda is 
an extremely endangered species indigenous only to China. Less than 
1,000 are thought to survive in the wild, mainly in nature reserves 
scattered through southwestern China.
