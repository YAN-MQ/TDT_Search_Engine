Tuesday morning saw the return of the Terror, at Christie's on Park 
Avenue. Not since the Revolution have so many highly valued French 
heads rolled. Billed by the auction house as ``the most valuable and 
important collection of European furniture ever to come to auction,'' 
the French &AMP; Co. sale of largely 18th-century furniture from aristocratic 
collections, including Versailles itself, was something of a blood 
bath. Promoted by a lavish $50 hardcover catalog _ 316 glossy pages 
for 81 lots _ the sale, estimated at $30 million, realized less than 
half of that: $12,962,868. Twenty-seven lots failed to sell, including 
the biggest star: a lacquered commode with a heavily documented claim 
to the 18th-century royal inventory at Versailles. Estimated at $4 
million to $6 million, it was bought in by the house at $3.6 million, 
a face-saving figure that doesn't reflect an actual sale. By the time 
Lord Hindlip, chairman of Christie's International, brought his hammer 
down on the last lot on the block, it was more guillotine than mallet. 
With scant bidding, the 10 a.m. sale ended at 11:30. ``This year's 
`sale of the century' flopped,'' said Leon Dalva, a New York dealer 
in 18th-century French furniture after the auction. ``It was obvious 
there were no bids.'' What happened? ``It wasn't the market that made 
a mistake,'' said Dalva, who spoke with the grave generosity of a 
man who has seen justice done. ``It was a marketing mistake on Christie's 
part.'' Based on the auction house's breathtaking estimates, experts 
familiar with the fine furniture market agreed that Christie's was 
attempting to cut out the middle men _ influential dealers like Dalva 
_ and go straight for that handful of cake-eating collectors who might 
swallow the prices. If true, it was a strategy, based on the current 
auction scene's successful capture of the public's imagination, that 
might have worked with Vincent van Gogh _ his self-portrait sold at 
Christie's last Thursday for $71.5 million, nearly three times its 
estimate _ but not with furniture. At Tuesday morning's sale, only 
collectors bought. But not enough materialized. And the dealers _ 
furniture sales' bread and butter _ largely boycotted the high bidding. 
With seven lots estimated at more than $1 million each, there could 
still have been the excitement that sets records. Instead, one indisputable 
factor set the sale up for a fall: The very beautiful goods were tired. 
As inventory for French &AMP; Co., one of New York's oldest and most 
prestigious art and antiques dealers, the furniture had never not 
been for sale. Serious buyers were dully familiar with its international 
sales' records for the last 30 years. The top lots were public figures. 
``It's not goods from a family; it was bought for French &AMP; Co. 
to sell,'' said Bernard Steinitz, a Parisian dealer, who nonetheless 
spoke of the pieces fondly, like cousins encountered at large family 
weddings. The collection had also recently been shopped in London 
as a group, to no avail at the asking price. Christie's gambled instead 
on cachet and provenance. Since it was established in 1840, French 
&AMP; Co. has done business with the best names in the game: J.P. 
Morgan, William Randolph Hearst, the Fricks and the Rockefellers, 
among others. Martin Zimet, the current chairman, entered the field 
by buying the firm in 1968, after being asked to assess it for Goldman 
Sachs &AMP; Co. His son, Henry, who has recently taken the helm, made 
the decision to divest the company of its decorative arts and concentrate 
on paintings. There were suggestions on Tuesday among attendees that 
French &AMP; Co.'s prestige was no longer potent enough to power the 
prices that Christie's had hoped for. In addition to freezing prices 
and a low glow on the sale's name, there were doubts about provenance 
that dogged certain pieces, including the high spot _ the so-called 
``Dauphine's commode,'' previewed at Christie's in Paris in September. 
The lacquered chest has a bold black stenciled ``No. 1343'' on the 
back, which is consistent with an 18th-century royal inventory number 
from the collection at Versailles. Christie's said it discovered the 
mark _ previously unrecorded _ during an examination of the piece 
in New York. The French antiquarian establishment questioned its authenticity 
loudly in the Parisian press. Alistair Clarke, a senior vice president 
and head of European furniture for Christie's in New York, said the 
controversy convinced the auction house to submit the mark's ink to 
laboratory testing, which revealed that the ink was not new. Versailles 
(and, Wednesday, the Louvre) said the commode was what Christie's 
presented it to be. ``It's a bit of sour grapes,'' said Clarke, who 
suggested that French dealers may have known the stencil was there 
and ignored it to allow the royal patrimonial piece to legally leave 
the country with a foreign buyer. None of this made for a happy ever 
after here in the New World. The Dauphine's commode found not even 
a chevalier on Tuesday. Instead, the sober room of pinstriped suits 
and soft, chic sportswear watched with cunning dispassion as Hindlip 
introduced the kingly lots. It seemed, at times, like the reverse 
of spending. At the outset, Hindlip leapt forward across the podium 
to reel in the bids as if he knew that the big fish were headed towards 
the bottom. By midsale, he was crisply closing the door, with a sharp 
tock of his gavel, like a rap on the knuckles to recalcitrant children. 
There was some distress about condition, too; in particular, the excessive 
re-gilding on many pieces, including a pair of sunny console tables, 
estimated at $300,000 to $500,000, that sold for $299,500. ``Fresh, 
like a Baci,'' said Giovanni Bucchi, a New York gilder and conservator, 
while previewing the pieces, referring to the Italian candies. ``If 
you bit into it, you would get stuff on your teeth.'' Clarke was necessarily 
philosophical Wednesday. ``We've all been disappointed before, life 
goes on,'' he said, implying also that dealers conspired to strangle 
the sale. ``It was breaking ground for a furniture sale.'' ``There 
haven't been many pieces in this bracket sold recently,'' he pointed 
out. ``To say the estimates were too high is unfair. I think there 
was a lot of jealousy about the sale in the market.'' The silver lining 
of the event, as Andree Corroon, a Christie's assistant vice president 
called it, was the performance of the English furniture, which was 
treated well by buyers. One chest, the Lonsdale Langlois commode, 
took an international auction record for an English commode, at $2,532,500. 
There was wide speculation, which Clarke would not confirm, that Christie's 
made a guarantee of money to the sellers against sale results. If 
so, Christie's owns a great deal of French furniture. ``Christie's 
will talk turkey now,'' said Dalva, the New York dealer, who said 
he intended to make offers on some of the lots. Minutes after Hindlip's 
last ``thank you,'' Steinitz, the Parisian dealer, bearded like Midas, 
was in a tete-a-tete with Clarke, as they walked arm in arm out of 
the sale room.
