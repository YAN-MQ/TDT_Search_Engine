Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a visit to Switzerland 
Wednesday, prompting an unusually harsh rebuke from Bern and heightening 
tensions over a campaign to have Swiss banks pay restitution to Holocaust 
victims. Netanyahu called off his trip at the last minute ``because 
of his effort to expand the Cabinet and achieve a stronger base for 
policy measures,'' his office said. The Swiss Cabinet expressed ``vexation'' 
over the cancellation and said in a statement that ``the problems 
that burden the relations between Switzerland and Israel continue.'' 
Swiss President Flavio Cotti said relations with Israel were ``tense'' 
in light of the affair. Netanyahu spent most of the night from Tuesday 
to Wednesday negotiating the return of his former foreign minister, 
David Levy, in an attempt to shore up his fragile coalition government. 
The prime minister also delayed his departure for Britain by several 
hours and took-off at 16:00gmt for London. He will travel onto Spain 
from there as originally planned. Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon 
also postponed a trip to the United States in order to deal with the 
coalition crisis. A shadow was cast over Netanyahu's trip to Switzerland 
after he participated last week in a ceremony honoring Americans and 
Israelis who had campaigned against Swiss banks. Those honored played 
a key role in winning the agreement of the banks to pay dlrs 1.2 billion 
to Holocaust survivors and the heirs of victims to settle claims for 
assets deposited in the banks during World War II. Swiss officials 
expressed their irritation over the award ceremony but did not rescind 
the invitation to Netanyahu. Cotti lashed out at Netanyahu for granting 
the honors to ``people who systematically make sweeping accusations 
and unfounded assertions.'' Relations had been good but, ``today, 
I must say, they are tense,'' Cotti said. The crisis will continue 
for some time until Switzerland gets ``some clear signs'' from Israel, 
he added. The Swiss Cabinet, 9th graf pvs
