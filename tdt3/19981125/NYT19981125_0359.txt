At one end of this city, supporters of Gen. Augusto Pinochet cried 
and cursed the British but carried on with a party celebrating his 
ill-timed 83rd birthday, anyway. At the other end, detractors of the 
former dictator danced in the streets while waving British flags and 
posters with pictures of victims who disappeared in his 17 years in 
power. Chile once again showed its deep divisions Wednesday, as it 
has through every twist and turn of Pinochet's legal troubles, which 
began with his arrest 41 days ago in London on a Spanish warrant. 
Police arrested at least four people and fired water canon to break 
up demonstrations downtown and in front of the British Embassy. No 
one was reported hurt. In the most serious incident officers and students 
clashed briefly at the University of Concepcion, a traditional center 
of activism in south-central Chile. Students threw stones and acid 
at the police, breaking the collarbone of one officer and slightly 
burning another. Political leaders of varied stripes called for calm, 
including President Eduardo Frei, who reminded a national television 
audience that it was his duty to guard against disorder. ``You can 
be absolutely certain that I will continue exercising that responsibility 
with firmness and decisiveness,'' Frei said. He announced that he 
was dispatching Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza Salinas to London 
and Madrid to press the case that Pinochet had diplomatic immunity 
as a senator for life and should be allowed to return to Chile. His 
choice of Insulza, a leader of the Socialist Party, to lead the diplomatic 
effort was a sharp rebuke to right-wing political leaders who have 
repeatedly contended that Socialists in the government coalition had 
conspired with European socialists to punish Pinochet. As a senator 
for life, a position created in the constitution written while the 
general was in power, the retired dictator has legal immunity in Chile. 
Although they are a people known for their reserve, Chileans wore 
their emotions on their sleeves Wednesday. ``I feel great pain that 
five people, five British judges, can decide the future of Chile,'' 
said Sen. Hernan Larrain Fernandez of the right-wing Independent Democratic 
Union Party. ``We're emotional and we're happy,'' Viviana Diaz, a 
leader of the Group of the Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared, 
said. ``We know our missing loved ones are with us at this wonderful 
moment.'' Some 400 protesters, many from the Communist Party, skipped, 
danced and sang through the downtown shopping district in a display 
of joy. ``We want to live in a Chile without Pinochet,'' they chanted. 
The mix of British flags next to banners emblazoned with the hammer 
and sickle was just one of many unusual images of the day. Chilean 
television showed Chilean human-rights protesters in London as they 
sang a facetious version of ``Happy Birthday'' in thick Spanish accents. 
The next clip showed red, white and blue balloons flying from some 
office windows of the Chilean Congress in celebration of Pinochet's 
birthday. The proceedings of the House of Lords on Wednesday were 
televised live in Santiago, and the reaction to the ruling was sharp 
and agitated at the headquarters of the Pinochet Foundation, a group 
dedicated to promoting the former dictator's legacy. Several people 
burst into tears, and others took out their frustrations at visiting 
journalists. Some tossed glasses of water at the reporters and photographers, 
while others pushed and kicked a television cameraman. The mood cheered 
up somewhat by nightfall, when more than 2,000 supporters of Pinochet 
gathered on the tree-lined street outside the foundation to celebrate 
the general's birthday. As the crowd sang patriotic songs, venders 
sold ``Thank You Pinochet'' head bands, ``I Love You Pinochet'' T-shirts, 
Chilean flags and ice cream. Through the evening the crowd chanted, 
``As long as Chile exists, it will never be Marxist.'' Meanwhile people 
carried posters that attacked ``British neocolonialism,'' a phrase 
that at another time might sound Marxist. ``I feel sadness, pain, 
hurt, because my rights as a citizen of a democratic sovereign country 
have been squashed,'' Maria Ines Martinez, 50, a public-relations 
executive, said. ``And our government hasn't been decisive and clear 
in defending our sovereignty.''
