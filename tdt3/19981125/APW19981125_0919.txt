They've found something new to fight about in the NBA lockout, and 
it could lead to the cancellation of further collective bargaining 
talks. Whatever progress owners and players made last week had deteriorated 
by Wednesday into another public fight. This time, it's a squabble 
over the details of the ``breakthrough'' they made in a 9 1/2-hour 
negotiating session Friday. NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik sent 
a letter to union director Billy Hunter, saying Saturday's scheduled 
resumption of talks should be called off in light of the newest dispute 
over a previously undisclosed ``backup tax'' that was put on the table 
at the last bargaining session. The union's negotiating committee 
planned a conference call for Wednesday to assess the situation. ``Now 
we have nothing. We're back to the beginning,'' Granik said. The league 
also informed NBC television on Tuesday that the network's popular 
Christmas Day doubleheader is the latest casualty of the nearly 5-month-old 
lockout. In place of the New York Knicks at the Chicago Bulls and 
the Los Angeles Lakers at the Phoenix Suns doubleheader, NBC will 
show Frank Capra's Christmas movie ``It's A Wonderful Life'' starring 
Jimmy Stewart. Unless a deal is reached by mid-December, more of NBC's 
schedule will be in jeopardy. The network is scheduled to begin its 
weekly telecasts Jan. 16 with regional coverage of three games. The 
so-called ``backup tax'' might be charged to the highest-spending 
owners in the final three or four years of a six- or seven-year agreement. 
The second tax, which Granik called a ``breakthrough,'' was proposed 
by the players Friday. The tax would only be collected if a previously 
agreed upon escrow tax _ 10 to 15 percent of players' paychecks _ 
failed to cover any discrepancy between the targeted percentage of 
revenues that owners agreed to devote to salaries and the amount they 
actually ended up paying. In other words, if owners exceeded a targeted 
salary total of dlrs 1.2 billion by dlrs 200 million, and the players 
paid only dlrs 150 million in escrow taxes, an extra dlrs 50 million 
would be collected from the highest-spending owners. The owners said 
the backup tax rate should be 200 percent; the players said they agreed 
to 100 percent. Using the above example, it's a question of whether 
dlrs 50 million or dlrs 100 million would be collected. ``They wanted 
to charge a double penalty on the owners who went over their share 
of the designated percentage, and we clarified that that part of their 
counterproposal was unacceptable. We aren't into the punitive aspect 
of it,'' said union lawyer Jeffrey Kessler. On Friday, the sides made 
progress on establishing a framework for a deal that would include 
a three-year period in which the sides would use different mechanisms 
to try to bring the growth of salaries under control. But if the amount 
of revenues devoted to salaries exceeded a certain percentage after 
three years, a so-called escrow tax would be withheld from players' 
paychecks and returned to the owners. Other major differences remain, 
yet there was hope that the owners and players could work things out 
this weekend. Now, that possibility looks remote. ``I don't know if 
we'll have a meeting, and I'll be surprised if we have one,'' Granik 
said. ``The owners have said that if this is the players' position, 
then there's no point in having a meeting now. And we have communicated 
that to Billy Hunter in a letter.'' Kessler, the lead outside counsel 
for the union, said the league was ``grandstanding in the media.'' 
``It's not going to lead to a deal, and that's very sad. Because they're 
playing with the lives of millions of people and thousands of fans, 
and they don't care. ``The players care, and we intend to be there 
Saturday. We hope someone shows up from their side,'' Kessler said. 
The union also issued a statement: ``If the NBA is serious about making 
a deal, they should stop posturing and come to the bargaining table 
this Saturday with the goal of ending the lockout and saving the season.''
