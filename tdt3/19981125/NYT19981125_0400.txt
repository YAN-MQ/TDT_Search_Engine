Bernie Williams, the Yankees' star center fielder, agreed to re-sign 
with the team on Wednesday after owner George Steinbrenner, in a staggering 
reversal, caved in to Williams' demand for a seven-year contract worth 
$87.5 million. The Yankees previously had offered Williams a five-year, 
$60 million deal, and even into Wednesday morning they refused to 
change that bid, feeling sure that even if Williams accepted a seven-year 
contract with rival Boston, they would instead sign prolific slugger 
Albert Belle. But in mid-afternoon, the Yankees learned that the Baltimore 
Orioles had offered a five-year, $65 million contract to Belle, far 
more than the Yankees wanted to pay the contentious outfielder. The 
prospect of being left without either Williams or Belle apparently 
led Steinbrenner to increase his offer to Williams by nearly 50 percent, 
essentially matching Boston's offer. ``I'm very happy the whole thing 
is over with,'' said Williams, in a conference call with reporters 
from Puerto Rico. ``It's just an honor for any player to play his 
entire major-league career with the same team. It was going to be 
hard for me to go somewhere else.'' Williams added: ``It came down 
to the fact that I wanted to be a Yankee.'' Said Brian Cashman, the 
Yankees' general manager: ``He was getting close to going to Boston, 
we were getting close to losing him. At some point during today, both 
parties took a step backwards and reached out again one more time, 
and after that it just happened quickly.'' Williams' deal is worth 
slightly less than the seven-year, $91 million deal catcher Mike Piazza 
received to re-sign with the Mets in October. Williams will receive 
$12 million in each of the next seven seasons, and the Yankees hold 
a $15 million option on an eighth season; the Yankees could buy out 
the eighth-year option for $3.5 million, making the total package 
worth $87.5 million. As part of limited no-trade clause, Williams 
can name six teams to which he cannot be dealt. Yankees officials 
were convinced for months that Williams would stay only if the Yankees 
extended the highest bid, and some within the organization believed 
that Williams' wife did not want her husband to return to New York. 
Williams met with Boston officials Sunday and Monday and fielded the 
seven-year offer. Williams acknowledged Wednesday night that he was 
close to a deal with the Red Sox. But before completing an agreement, 
he asked for one last meeting with the Yankees, going face-to-face 
with Steinbrenner on Tuesday. That conversation and Baltimore's sudden 
interest in Belle led to the deal with the Yankees. The Orioles now 
are poised to sign Belle and the Red Sox come out of the fray as big 
losers, without Williams or Mo Vaughn, the popular first baseman who 
left Boston this year and agreed Wednesday to a six-year, $80 million 
with the Anaheim Angels. Boston's decision to break off talks with 
Vaughn helped create the bidding war for Williams that ensued between 
them and the Yankees. ``What it came down to is that I'm not sure 
Bernie ever really wanted to leave the Yankees,'' said Red Sox General 
Manager Dan Duquette, ``and when George Steinbrenner realized that 
one of the best all-around players the Yankees have had since Joe 
DiMaggio was ready to leave, he wouldn't let that happen.'' The Yankees 
are significant winners in keeping Williams, a two-time Gold Glove 
winner who won the American League batting title this year. Williams 
is well-liked and respected by his teammates, whereas signing Belle 
would have invited potential disaster into their harmonious clubhouse. 
The Yankees are significant financial losers, however, in their long-term 
dealings with Williams. A year ago, they offered Williams a five-year, 
$37.5 million deal, at a time when he wanted a seven-year, $70 million. 
About 10 days ago, the Yankees offered Williams the five-year deal, 
and preparing for the very real possibility he would sign elsewhere, 
they opened serious discussions with Belle and another outfielder, 
Brian Jordan. But the Yankees waited to see if Williams had serious 
offers from other teams and to see if he really wanted to re-sign 
_ and as they waited, Jordan signed a five-year, $40 million deal 
with the Atlanta Braves on Monday, and the Orioles aggressively joined 
the bidding for Belle. The Yankees' delays in addressing Williams' 
situation cost them between $30 million and $50 million. Having recently 
negotiated a contract with Steinbrenner, veteran pitcher David Cone 
believed that the posturing between the Yankees and Williams was ``like 
a high-stakes poker game, where something had to give.'' ``Everybody's 
going to be excited and happy to see Bernie back,'' Cone said. The 
signing of Williams means the Yankees, who won 125 games and the World 
Series last summer, will field virtually the same group of players 
in 1999. ``It's pretty rare in today's game to see that happen,'' 
said Cone. ``Bernie is the final piece to the nucleus _ he's been 
a lifelong Yankee, and it's pretty refreshing to see him stay.''
