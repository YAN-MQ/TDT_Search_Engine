Meanwhile, Russia continues to search for income wherever it can be 
done. VOA's Gil Butler reports an agreement with Iran was signed Tuesday. 
It's supposed to complete work on an Iranian nuclear power plant and 
to study the possibility of constructing a second one, despite U.S. 
objections. The Russian news agency ITAR-Tass reported an agreement 
was signed in Tehran to speed up construction of a power plant in 
Bushehr, Iran. No date was given for the completion of the plant, 
but both Iran and Russia have said it is expected to be commissioned 
next year. In addition, there is to be a three-month feasibility study 
for construction of another 1,000-megawatt unit at Bushehr and a second 
plant elsewhere in Iran. The cost of the first Bushehr facility was 
put by Iranian officials at $780 to $800 million. At a joint news 
conference in Tehran, Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov 
was quoted as saying pressure brought on Russia by the United States 
not to build the nuclear plant will not affect the schedule. Both 
the United States and Israel have objected to Iran's acquiring nuclear 
technology, fearing it could be used to develop nuclear weapons. Russia 
insists the reactor can be used only for civilian purposes. Tehran 
radio also says the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate power 
and says the facilities have been approved by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. The Russian news agency says nuclear waste from the 
Bushehr plant is to be shipped to Russia for reprocessing, then returned 
to Iran for repeated use. ITAR-Tass also quoted Mr. Adamov as saying 
Ukraine's refusal to supply turbines for the plant will have no effect 
either because they will now be constructed in St. Petersburg. The 
Bushehr nuclear plant was originally planned by the late Shah of Iran 
in 1974, but the Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war halted work. 
Russia agreed to build the plant in 1995, and some 600 Russians have 
been at work, and an apparently accelerated timetable has been established 
for its completely. Gil Butler, VOA News, Moscow.
