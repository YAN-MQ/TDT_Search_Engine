Bryan Cox, believed to be the most heavily fined player in pro football 
history, has been on his best behavior since joining the New York 
Jets in August and, as a result, had been enjoying a fine-free season. 
But the National Football League fined Cox $10,000 Wednesday for unnecessary 
roughness during the Jets' victory last Sunday in Nashville, and afterward 
he lashed out, accusing the league of racism. Cox, who is black, used 
the words ``tokens'' and ``house Negroes'' in discussing two black 
NFL officials _ Gene Washington, the director of football operations, 
who handed down the fine, and Harold Henderson, the labor relations 
director. ``With this league being over 70 percent black, and within 
the league office all the black people that are in any position of 
authority are always pitted against the players in the league,'' Cox 
said. ``I feel like that's unfortunate, and I don't like that.'' Cox, 
a linebacker, was not penalized for either of the plays for which 
he was fined Wednesday. Both involved hits with his forearm in the 
second quarter, one to the head of Oilers quarterback Steve McNair 
and one to running back Eddie George. The latest fines bring Cox's 
career total to at least $146,000. They marked only the second time 
in his career that Cox has been fined for his play _ the other fines 
had to do with actions away from play involving fans or officials, 
or fighting. Cox says he has been fined more than $200,000 in a career 
that began in 1991, but published records show a total of $146,000. 
The NFL has fined him $136,000 and he was also fined at least once, 
for $10,000, by the Bears, his previous team. He was not fined by 
the Dolphins in five seasons in Miami. Cox conceded that he was wrong 
on the hit against George, but defended his actions against McNair, 
a scrambling quarterback who had just run for 17 yards. ``I was trying 
to tomahawk the ball, and when I swung, he slid and his head went 
where the ball was,'' Cox said. Cox, initially low-keyed as he discussed 
the fines at his locker, then took on the league. That is not unusual 
_ Cox has already filed two lawsuits against the NFL. One of his complaints 
Wednesday was that he is unable to designate the charities his fine 
money goes to. Cox said he wanted it to go to a youth center founded 
by Jackie Joyner-Kersee in his native East St. Louis, Ill. Cox complained 
that there was no predominantly black charity that receives fine money. 
By a 1993 agreement with the Players Association, the money is split 
among four charities, two chosen by the league and two by the union. 
The league gives the money to cancer funds named for Vince Lombardi 
and Brian Piccolo while the players group chose a Lou Gehrig's disease 
charity and another that helps needy former players. Before the 1993 
agreement, the money went solely to the cancer funds. Coach Bill Parcells, 
who rescued the 30-year-old Cox from limbo last summer after he was 
cut by the Bears, said of the fines, ``I'm not in a position to agree 
or disagree.'' But he also said that the hit against McNair ``could 
have been interpreted in a couple of ways.'' Cox, a former Pro Bowler 
who was out of shape when Parcells called on him, quickly become a 
major figure on defense for a team hurt by injuries to its linebackers. 
He is now the starting weakside linebacker, having sent last year's 
top draft pick, James Farrior, to the sideline.
