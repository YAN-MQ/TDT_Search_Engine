THE WORLD's Eddie Mear receives visitors of all kinds at his apartment 
in London. Just ahead, dashed hoop dreams from around the world on 
PRI, Public Radio International. "A Prairie Home Companion" comes 
to you live from New York City this week with jazz singer and pianist 
Diana Craw. Bass saxophonist Vince Giardano and our very own Andy 
Stein plays a duet with his dad on piano. And of course Garrison Keeler 
will bring you all the news from Lake Woebegone. That's on "A Prairie 
Home Companion" Saturday night at, Sunday afternoon at 3:00, and Sunday 
night at midnight on 91 FM, WHYY. Holiday shopping is upon us, but 
don't let it stress you. I'm Ellen Kushner. On this week's "Sound 
and Spirit," we'll be hearing a host of new CD releases, seeking out 
the sound that hits the spirit of everyone on your list. We'll also 
hear letters about past programs and take a look forward into the 
new year. It's "Sound and Spirits" gift giving edition from PRI, Public 
Radio International. Saturday night at on 91 FM, WHYY. This is THE 
WORLD. I'm Lisa Mullins.
