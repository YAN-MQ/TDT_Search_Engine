Emergency measures are needed to save Russia's people from the ravages 
of the country's economic collapse, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
said Wednesday. Primakov said the 1999 budget would have to include 
the unspecified measures to cushion the economic blows. A draft of 
the long-awaited budget was delivered to the Cabinet later in the 
day. However, Primakov, speaking at the Ministry of Emergency Situations, 
went on to insist that the country was not in a state of emergency. 
He said the economy had no problems that couldn't be fixed with help 
from the state. ``We can't go on waiting for the market environment 
to solve our problems,'' the prime minister said, according to the 
Interfax news agency. ``In such a difficult transition, development 
must progress along a mechanism worked out in advance.'' Russia's 
economy, which had begun to grow last year for the first time since 
the Soviet collapse, succumbed this year to the global economic crisis 
that started in Asia. It crashed in August, when the Russian government 
devalued the ruble and effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
