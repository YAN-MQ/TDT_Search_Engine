Michael J. fox, one of America's best-loved actors, has decided to 
publicly announce that he has been battling Parkinson's disease since 
1991. Parkinson's by itself is not fatal, but it often accelerates 
the onset of other fatal conditions. Fox has kept this a secret for 
seven years. But even more surprising, fox is just 37. How could the 
disease strike someone so young? NBC's chief science correspondent, 
Robert Bazell. Michael J. fox was filming "doc Hollywood" in Gainesville, 
florida, in 1991 when he noticed a slight tremor in his left pinkie 
finger. Subsequent medical tests revealed the stunning news that at 
age 30, the film and television star was suffering from Parkinson's 
disease. People magazine quotes fox as saying -- Parkinson's disease, 
characterized by uncontrollable shaking or constantly stiffened muscles, 
afflicts about 1 million Americans, including Mohammed Ali, Katherine 
Hepburn, Billy Graham and Janet Reno. Usually it strikes older people, 
but 10% of the time it is diagnosed at age 40 or younger. Parkinson's 
disease has always affected young people, it just that perhaps it 
wasn't appreciated before and properly diagnosed. In a few cases, 
Gene mutations or toxic chemicals can bring on parkinson's, but in 
the vast majority of cases, including fox's, no one knows the cause. 
Parkinson's begins with the death of cells in a part of the brain 
called the substantia nigra. This leads to decreased production of 
a key brain chemical called dopamine, which controls muscle movement. 
Most Parkinson's patients can keep their symptoms under control with 
medications that make up for the missing dopamine in the brain. It 
is not unusual for a patient to remain intact and continue to work 
for many years. Surgeons are trying several experimental brain operations 
for people whose symptoms cannot be controlled by medication. Michael 
J. fox underwent one experimental brain surgery with good results. 
Sybil Guthrie of Atlanta volunteered for a similar procedure, called 
deep brain stimulation. Before surgeries on both sides of her brain, 
she was trembling constantly, unable to walk. Afterwards -- That's 
amazing. Look at her! The early success of these surgeries offers 
great hope for michael J. fox and the million others with this horrible 
affliction. Robert Bazell, NBC news, New York.
