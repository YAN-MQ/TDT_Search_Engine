Afghanistan's Taliban militia on Wednesday released the last Iranian 
prisoner it had been holding since August, the official Islamic Republic 
News Agency reported. Truck driver Manuchehr Amiri was handed over 
to an Iranian Foreign Ministry official in Afghanistan and the two 
later left for Iran, the agency said. Iran says Afghanistan had been 
holding 70 Iranians, half of them truck drivers. The truck drivers 
were detained by Taliban forces after they captured the northern Afghan 
city of Mazar-e-Sharif in August. Taliban forces killed eight Iranian 
diplomats and a journalist during the city's capture, which resulted 
in a straining of ties between the two neighboring countries. Iran 
deployed about 200,000 troops, backed by tanks and fighter aircraft, 
on its Afghan border in September. But the situation improved in early 
October after the intervention of U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, 
who shuttled between Tehran and Kabul and secured the release of 26 
of the Iranians held captive in Afghanistan. The first batch of five 
truck drivers were released in September. The truck drivers were in 
Afghanistan delivering humanitarian goods, Iran says. But the Taliban 
claim they were smuggling weapons to the Afghan opposition.
