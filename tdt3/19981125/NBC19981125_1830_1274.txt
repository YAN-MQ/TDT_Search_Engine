In London tonight, a huge legal setback for augusto Pinochet. The 
former dictator of Chile was arrested while in England last month 
for crimes against humanity. Now, on his 83rd birthday, England's 
house of lordses has ruled that he can be prosecuted for those crimes. 
NBC's Kevin Tibbles explains. "justice at last" they chant, as Britain's 
highest court rules today that former Chilean dictator augusto Pinochet 
has no immunity from prosecution as a former head of state. Celebration 
and tears today, as families and friends remember Pinochet's victims, 
the people they call "the disappeared" -- 4,000 imprisoned, tortured, 
murdered during Pinochet's 17-year reign. Nicole drouilly's sister 
vanished 23 years ago. These old photographs and a piece of a faded 
sweater she made are all that remain of Jacqueline. It's extremely 
important to us. With her husband Marcello, Jacqueline was three months 
pregnant with their first child when Pinochet's secret police raided 
their home and took Jacqueline in the middle of the night. She was 
beaten and raped, and she was hung by her feet. They never saw her 
again. Very often I wake up with this terrible nightmare about her, 
in which there is no solution for her because she is still there. 
There is still no peace for her. But now there finally may be peace 
and justice. The ghosts from Pinochet's past caught up with him six 
weeks ago when the general came to London for back surgery and was 
arrested on a Spanish warrant. His hospital room turned into a prison 
cell. Pinochet had argued he was immune from prosection. But today's 
ruling means Britain must now decide whether to extradite him to Spain 
to stand trial. In the Chilean capital Santiago today, Pinochet's 
supporters clashed with police. Attacking journalists, calling the 
ruling inhumane. But, outside the British parliament today, Nicole 
drouilly hopes her sister will finally rest in peace. The only way 
I will be able to come to peace with her is if we get justice, and 
this is the beginning of justice for her and everyone else. Justice 
for the disappeared -- and for the general whose past may have finally 
caught up with him. Kevin Tibbles, NBC, London.
