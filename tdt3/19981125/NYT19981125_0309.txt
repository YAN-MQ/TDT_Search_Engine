The honeymoon is definitely over for the Socialist prime minister, 
Lionel Jospin, who made this plea on French news radio on Tuesday 
night: ``No impatience _ let us govern!'' Jospin's popularity is still 
high, a year and a half after he won power and shocked his conservative 
opponents. But after the glory days of last summer, when Jospin seemed 
on top of the world, his leftist coalition of Socialists, Greens and 
Communists has begun fraying at the seams. Earlier this month, Environment 
Minister Dominique Voynet criticized Jospin openly for not granting 
residence permits to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who had 
applied. ``We legalized 80,000 men and women,'' the prime minister 
said. ``We did exactly what we said we were going to do.'' The 60,000 
others, he added, would be called on to leave France ``in normal conditions.'' 
That meant he would not forcibly fly them in chartered planes back 
to the impoverished African countries from which most came, as the 
government of his conservative predecessor, Alain Juppe, had done. 
Still, some of Jospin's leftist supporters have been grumbling that 
it is hard to tell the difference between the two men by their policies. 
Jospin's government also suffered a setback this fall over a bill 
it had proposed to provide the legal equivalent of marriage for same-sex 
partners. With the country's Roman Catholic bishops criticizing the 
bill as a threat to the institution of the family, conservative legislators 
mobilized so much opposition in Parliament that some Socialist members 
abandoned the floor during a crucial vote. The opposition carried 
the day on Oct. 9 and rejected the bill, leaving Jospin to complain, 
``When you have convictions, you should be ready to defend them.'' 
Jospin's Communist supporters in Parliament, meanwhile, are increasingly 
restive over far more planned privatization of state-owned industries 
like France Telecom and Air France than they thought they had signed 
on for when the left came to power. And even with a Communist minister 
of transport in charge of the state railway system, the railroad workers 
plan to close down the system on Friday for the second time this week 
to push the rail network to hire more workers as it moves to a 35-hour 
week a year from now. Jospin's government mandated a nationwide reduction 
from 39 to 35 hours a week as its main job-creation measure, but only 
160,000 of the more than 3 million unemployed have found jobs since 
he took power. So he seemed eager to stake out his leftist credentials 
in the radio appearance. Alluding to the deaths from exposure of nine 
homeless people during a cold snap this month, despite a cradle-to-grave 
welfare system the conservatives never even tried to cut back during 
the years they were in power, Jospin said: ``This society, the way 
it was run over 10 to 15 years, is a society where the dominant ideas 
were those of letting the markets have free rein, of everybody looking 
after themselves.'' ``If we have precariousness systematically in 
the workplace, we shouldn't be astonished the day precariousness comes 
to life in the streets,'' he added, in a jab at French companies that 
have been reluctant to hire people for more than a year at a time 
because laws make it difficult to lay off permanent employees. ``We 
are a government of the long term,'' said Jospin, who is said to be 
planning to run against Jacques Chirac for the presidency in 2002.
