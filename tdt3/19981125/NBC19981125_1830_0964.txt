Bumper-to-bumper traffic is almost a holiday tradition. But adding 
to the misery of getting anywhere by car these days is the sorry state 
of America's roads and highways. NBC's Dan Lothian continues tonight's 
"in depth" reporting with the pitfalls and the potholes of traveling 
by road. It seems like a parking lot from coast to coast. Millions 
trapped in traffic. Today, in Dallas and Los Angeles -- and just when 
you thought it couldn't get worse -- potholes! It's disgusting. You 
have to be careful or you're gonna bottom out. a recent study by the 
surface transportation policy project concludes 57% of our most traveled 
roads need repairs. Many of them desperately. We pay a lot of money 
in taxes every year for roads. The problem is they don't spend it 
on road repair. The result, they say, drivers spend almost $6 billion 
on repairs every year. But states spend just $2.7 billion to fix those 
roads. If you break down the numbers, the study finds, on average, 
American's are paying about $1,000 over the life of a car for damage 
caused by bad roads, fixing everything from blown tires to broken 
suspensions. Where are the worst roads? The study says Oregon, Illinois, 
Colorado, Pennsylvania and Louisiana. Their urban interstates, freeways 
and expressways, between 80% to 92% of them, needing immediate repairs 
or attention in the very near future. But some transportation officials 
say the study is flawed. We think the roads are in far better condition 
than that. And while fixing roads may solve one problem, it's not 
the solution to that other headache, made worse this holiday -- traffic. 
It's just a matter of we have an ever-growing population and they 
drive. Studies show the public wants more new highways to ease congestion. 
But some say, unless the nation makes a commitment to fixing old roads 
instead of building new ones, the ride for 200 million drivers, this 
holiday season and beyond, will only get worse. Dan Lothian, NBC news, 
Los Angeles.
