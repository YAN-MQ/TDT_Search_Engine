With a look at your "CNN Headline News Weather," I'm Karen Maginnis. 
Going into one of the biggest travel days of the season, temperatures 
will only be in the 30s across the upper Mississippi river valley, 
into Hudson bay, into New England and Quebec, as well as the Canadian 
maritimes. But 70s and 80s can be found from Florida to southern Texas 
and into the desert southwest. Our forecast weather picture is looking 
at another fierce storm system for the pacific northwest and into 
central California. High winds across the headlands in excess of 70 
miles an hour possible. And swinging across the Great Lakes and into 
southern James bay, comes another frontal system that will interrupt 
the weather picture, it looks like, into the northeast and New England 
going into Thanksgiving day. Anchorage, Alaska, can expect some flurries 
and 22. Around 80 degrees for Hilo. 84 expected in San Juan. In our 
extended forecast for Thanksgiving day, very unsettled across the 
eastern seaboard and the pacific northwest. Going into Friday, very 
mild through the central plains, lots of 60s and 70s. On Saturday, 
70s from Texas and into the gulf coast. For more weather information, 
log on to CNN.com.
