Family members of French citizens who disappeared under the rule of 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet cheered and embraced Wednesday upon hearing 
that Britain's House of Lords had denied immunity to the former Chilean 
dictator. Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said the decision 
was ``a joy.'' But France's extreme-right National Front party -- 
the only voice out of step with the euphoria -- called it ``scandalous.'' 
``It's a victory for law and morality,'' said William Bourdon, a lawyer 
representing some of those families, after passing the news on to 
his clients. ``A trial of Pinochet is now possible in Paris and in 
Madrid.'' France asked for Pinochet's extradition on Nov. 12. And 
on Tuesday, a French judge issued a second international arrest warrant 
for Pinochet. The latest arrest order accuses Pinochet of the detention 
and torture of two French citizens who disappeared after the ouster 
of Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973. An earlier French warrant, 
issued Nov. 2, accused Pinochet of the detention and torture of three 
other French citizens who disappeared. ``This is a surprise. This 
is a joy,'' Jospin told reporters. ``It's bad news for all dictators.'' 
The prime minister said he felt the British decision amounts to ``new 
progress in the idea that no crime can go unpunished.'' The International 
Federation of Human Rights Leagues expressed its ``profound satisfaction.'' 
But the National Front party said the decision was neither judicious 
nor equitable. ``Half the heads of state'' taking part in the French-African 
summit opening Thursday in Paris ``could find themselves in handcuffs'' 
were the same measures applied to them as to Pinochet, the party statement 
said. Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish arrest warrant Oct. 16 while 
in a London hospital recuperating from back surgery. Spanish authorities 
want to extradite Pinochet to face charges of genocide during his 
1973-90 rule. A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered 
or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew Allende, 
an elected Marxist.
