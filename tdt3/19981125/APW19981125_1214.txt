Pete Sampras is playing too well to have to worry about figuring out 
the intricacies of the round-robin format. After beating Carlos Moya 
6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday, Sampras was not even aware that he had clinched 
a place in the semifinals of the ATP World Championship. ``That's 
nice to hear,'' Sampras said after being told at the post-match news 
conference that he had secured a place in the last four. ``It's certainly 
a good feeling to be here over the weekend,'' Sampras said. Meanwhile, 
Andre Agassi dropped out of the tournament because of a back injury 
and will be replaced by Greg Rusedski. Agassi retired in the third 
set of his match against Alex Corretja on Wednesday. Sampras is seeking 
to become the first man to finish as No. 1 in the world for six years 
in a row. Marcelo Rios, the only player who can threaten Sampras, 
trails by 33 points in the computer rankings and has to do better 
than Sampras in the elite season-ending championship that brings together 
the top eight players of the year. But Rios, who was not scheduled 
to play Wednesday, lost his first match to Tim Henman and is battling 
a back injury. He now has to win his next two round-robin matches 
to reach the semifinals and stay in the chase. The eight players are 
split into two groups and Sampras and Rios cannot meet until the semifinals. 
``It helps,'' Sampras said of Rios losing the first match. ``I'm also 
helping myself by winning. I can't really be too concerned about what 
Marcelo is doing.'' ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If I take 
care of things myself and go out and win, then it should be hopefully 
good enough. But I must admit I was rooting for the Englishman (Henman) 
yesterday,'' Sampras said. Sampras was certainly good enough to beat 
Moya in only 62 minutes. Moya, the French Open champion who is now 
1-1, had beaten Sampras in a group match last year but Sampras went 
on to win the dlrs 3.5 million event for the fourth time. On Tuesday, 
Sampras was equally impressive in dismissing Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 
straight sets. ``It's not easy to play well like I have been today 
and yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,'' 
Sampras said. ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit 
more than last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much 
pressure on him as possible.'' ``Last year I must admit I felt a little 
flat. This year, with the ranking up for grabs, I just made a concerted 
effort to come here a little bit early and prepare as best as I can. 
``It's obviously a very big week for Marcelo and I. I just wanted 
to give myself the best chance possible to play well here,'' said 
Sampras, who fired 13 aces. Corretja was leading 5-7, 6-3, 2-1 when 
Agassi quit. Agassi was practicing with Corretja on Monday when he 
fell and hurt his back and has been receiving shots and other treatment 
since then. ``It was definitely painful even this morning in my warmup. 
I needed to give it a go, at least try to keep the points short,'' 
said Agassi, who won the event in 1990. ``But I hit a swinging volley 
and when I twisted it was just like somebody stuck a knife in me. 
Pretty soon it got quite pointless,'' he said. Rusedski will play 
Rios on Thursday. Corretja plays Henman and Sampras meets Karol Kucera. 
Kafelnikov beat Kucera 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-2 in the last match Wednesday 
and improved to 1-1. Kucera dropped to 0-2. Although he has surged 
back No. 4 this year after falling as low as No. 141 at the same time 
last year, Agassi has not done well at major tournaments this season. 
``The year has been great for me in many respects, but the great tournaments 
have been pretty disappointing,'' Agassi said. ``I've worked really 
hard and had to grind week after week to get myself in position, only 
to struggle when I got into position.''
