This is THE WORLD, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, 
and WGBH Boston. It's Wednesday, November 25th. I'm Lisa Mullins in 
Boston. Today, Britain's highest court declares that Augusto Pinochet 
is not immune from arrest. You simply can't get away with - in future 
with crimes against humanity unless at least you stay home. And fans 
say the NBA is immune from common sense. I think the rest of the world 
finds us quite strange that we operate the way we do, that sometimes 
when we have the best of everything, even still we shut that down 
and demand more. First, this news. From National Public Radio News 
in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff.
