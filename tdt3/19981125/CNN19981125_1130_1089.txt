The man responsible for what authorities call the largest pyramid 
scheme in U.S. history has pled guilty to reduced charges, but will 
still face up to five years in prison. The government claimed that 
Michael Bennett ran a scheme to bilk $700 million from over 20,000 
investors, many of them elderly. A bankruptcy court trustee has said 
Bennett and his family owe more than $1 billion to the pyramid scheme 
investors. Bennett will be sentenced in February.
