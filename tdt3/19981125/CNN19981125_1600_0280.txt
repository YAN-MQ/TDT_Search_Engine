The White House says it will be Friday before it delivers answers 
to 81 questions from the house Judiciary committee. The panel is holding 
an impeachment inquiry. A spokeswoman says Mr. Clinton and his lawyers 
are still working on responses. The questions from Judiciary committee 
chairman Henry Hyde are based on independent counsel Ken Starr's report 
to Congress on the Monica Lewinsky matter. Hyde is threatening to 
subpoena the president if he doesn't submit the answers by Monday.
