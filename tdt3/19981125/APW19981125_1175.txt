Despite its continued opposition, Iraq has agreed to the terms of 
a six-month renewal of the U.N. program that lets it buy humanitarian 
goods with proceeds from oil sales, Baghdad's ambassador said Wednesday. 
Iraq will submit a plan to distribute the food, medicine and other 
goods by Saturday, and will resume exports after it has been approved, 
Nizar Hamdoon said. Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil 
since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Gulf War. The 
council will only lift the sanctions after U.N. arms experts report 
that Baghdad has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction. The council 
agreed to start the oil-for-food program in 1996 to allow imports 
of basic necessities for Iraq's 22 million people. On Tuesday, the 
Security Council renewed the program, agreeing to let Iraq sell another 
dlrs 5.2 billion in oil over six months. Iraq has criticized the program 
as a tool for the United States and its allies to provide token relief 
for suffering Iraqis while keeping the broader sanctions in place. 
Iraqi leaders had proposed a two-month extension of the program, rather 
than a six-month renewal, amid concern that a renewal would implicitly 
extend sanctions another six months. In recent weeks, Baghdad has 
interrupted U.N. weapons inspections and lobbied for a review of sanctions 
it hopes will end the embargo. Nevertheless, Hamdoon said Wednesday 
Iraq would sign on to the new oil sale. ``We'll be submitting the 
distribution plan by Saturday,'' Hamdoon said. Prices for Iraqi crude 
have fallen from an average of dlrs 18 per barrel in the first phase 
of the ``oil-for-food'' program to dlrs 10 per barrel in the present 
phase, which ends Wednesday, U.N. records show.
