Turkey has denied that it is officially boycotting Italian goods because 
of a dispute over its request for the extradition of Kurdish rebel 
leader Abdullah Ocalan. Turkey's representative to the European Union 
issued the statement after EU Commissioner President Jacques Santer 
said a formal boycott would violate EU agreements. It says many Turks 
on their own are boycotting Italian products to show anger at Italy's 
refusal to hand over the Kurdish rebel leader. Italian law forbids 
extradition of anyone to a country that has the death penalty.
