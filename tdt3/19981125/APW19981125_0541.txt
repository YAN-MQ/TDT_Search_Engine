More than 100 demonstrators from state enterprises greeted Parliament's 
opening Wednesday with a protest against privatization plans required 
under the International Monetary Fund's economic rescue package. The 
protesters, representing 38 different state enterprises, used loudspeakers 
and banners to denounce plans to turn state enterprises into private 
companies and open up the country to foreign investors. Thailand's 
state enterprises employ about 300,000 people. ``IMF - World Bank 
- Go To Hell!'' said one banner. The IMF organized a dlrs 17 billion 
bailout for Thailand's economy. ``We are not for sale,'' said another. 
In a written statement, the State Enterprises Workers' Relations Confederation 
accused American financier George Soros, the IMF and the World Bank 
of working together to bring down the country's economy before forcing 
it open for exploitation. ``The undeniable fact is that the attack 
on the baht by George Soros and other foreign speculators, and then 
the agreement between the Thai government and the IMF which happened 
without the people's knowledge or agreement, have resulted in hundreds 
of thousands of Thais losing their jobs,'' the statement said. Soros 
has denied attacking the baht, which the government allowed to float 
in July last year. It quickly sank in value, making it difficult for 
many Thai companies to pay back dollar- and yen-denominated loans. 
Most economists attribute the country's economic difficulties to structural 
problems and imprudent financial practices in both the public and 
private sectors. Speaking to reporters upon arriving at the Parliament, 
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi defended the country's 
privatization plans, saying the move is part of a global trend. ``We're 
not doing this because outsiders are ordering us to,'' he said. ``What 
we are doing is no different from other countries.'' Thailand's immediate 
concern is to invest in businesses that create lots of jobs, as unemployment 
has become a major problem for the country, Supachai said.
