Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat says it is a preparation for independence. 
Arafat and dozens of VIPs helped celebrate the opening of Gaza international 
airport Tuesday. Crowds of Palestinians also attended. Many of them 
had never before seen a plane on the ground. They say the airport 
is a sign the peace process with Israel is moving forward. I'm just 
more determined now that peace can work. I am just more determined 
that the Palestinian people will enjoy their statehood, their freedom, 
their independence just like anybody else in the world. Israel will 
monitor the airport and will be able to detain people or cargo it 
sees as a security threat.
