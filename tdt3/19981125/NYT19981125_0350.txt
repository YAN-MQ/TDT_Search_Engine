Nestle A.G., the Swiss food giant, has become the latest European 
company to feel the bite of the emerging-markets meltdown, announcing 
Wednesday that collapsing sales in Russia and Asia will drastically 
slow profit growth this year. Nestle, known in the United States for 
Taster's Choice coffee and Perrier mineral water, said food sales 
in its Africa, Asia and Australia regions had slumped by 8.7 percent 
in the first 10 months of the year, to 10 billion francs, or $7.1 
billion, compared with sales in the period a year earlier. In Russia, 
sales plummeted by 30 percent, though Nestle gave no sales figure. 
In July, Nestle reported that sluggish sales in Japan and Brazil, 
markets that had shown abundant recent promise, coupled with a stronger 
Swiss franc were clouding its growth outlook. At a news conference 
at its headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, Nestle said global revenue 
in the first 10 months rose by 4 percent, to 59.2 billion Swiss francs, 
or $42.1 billion, from 56.9 billion francs in the period a year earlier. 
More seriously, Nestle said commitments in Russia to deliver products 
at dollar prices calculated before the ruble's 60 percent plunge in 
value against the dollar would cut into earnings. Peter Brabeck, who 
took over last year as Nestle's chief executive, said that higher 
interest rates in Latin America would also weigh on earnings. He added, 
however, that continued robust demand for Nestle products in the United 
States and Western Europe would help offset the downward trend elsewhere. 
The results demonstrated how tricky it is becoming to keep a global 
giant like Nestle on course in the turbulence of recent months. Mario 
Corti, Nestle's chief financial officer, said that the vast Russian 
market, where Nestle had predicted it would generate sales this year 
of 1 billion francs, or $711 million, had remained strong through 
June. ``Then, it fell out of bed,'' he said. But Nestle's misfortunes 
in Russia were amplified by inadequate hedging against the ruble's 
sharp drop against the dollar, the currency on which Nestle bases 
its business there, he said. Investors punished the company by selling 
its shares, pushing the share price on the Zurich market down by more 
than 4 percent, to 2,990 Swiss francs, or $2,126. But analysts' reactions 
to the news were mixed. Nestle reported that real internal growth, 
or growth in revenue excluding acquisitions, divestments and changes 
in sale prices and exchange rates, was 4.6 percent. Rene Weber, who 
follows Nestle at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, called that figure ``rather 
good,'' given that most analysts' estimates were about 4 percent. 
But estimates of earnings growth for the full year, he said, which 
had been about 9 percent, ``have now gone back actually to zero.'' 
Nestle said it expected sales of more than 70 billion francs, or $49.7 
billion, in the full year. Brabeck said that he expected real internal 
growth for the full year to reach 4 percent and that profit growth 
would ``slightly exceed'' that figure. Vontobel's Weber said internal 
growth would be lower than total sales growth because of the exclusion 
of Spillers, a British pet food company that Nestle acquired earlier 
this year for $1.16 billion, but which he termed a ``good long-term 
investment.'' Brabeck said Nestle was taking ``energetic measures'' 
to counter the crises in Asia and Russia, including such ``back to 
basics'' steps as introducing lower-priced products, developing new 
distribution channels and reviewing costs. Nestle, he said, had closed 
10 factories thus far this year, including four in Latin America and 
one in Asia.
