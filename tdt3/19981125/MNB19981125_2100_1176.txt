On this busy travel night nationwide we have a look at air fare from 
an insider, specifically, ways to get away the expensive fare structure 
that can kill those who want to get home. Tom Parsons is the founder 
and publisher of bestfares.com. he is with us from Fort Worth, Texas. 
Tom, a lot of people here, well, there is another way out, there is 
another way, there are cheaper fares, but high overhead. You have 
to get on the Internet. You can't travel when you want to, take major 
carriers. What do cow tell people? I think this weekend, if you just 
choose the right days, and if you still feel a little guilty because 
you didn't visit mom, we've got cheap air fares out there if you follow 
the rules. If you leave tomorrow morning and come back Friday night 
or tomorrow night, or Saturday, you can go to cities up to 500 miles 
of your airport city for about $118 round trip. And that's pretty 
cheap with no advance purchase. Then, when we look at air fares up 
to 1,000 miles, we're only paying $178, looking at cities like Dallas 
to Chicago. But if you want to come home on Sunday, the fare jumps 
to $1,200. If you want to go to 1,500 miles, you're looking at a fare 
of about $198 round trip. And coast to coast, air fares coming in 
around $318 round trip. But, again, looking at 24-, 40-hour getaway. 
Are these name brands? Do we have to go through your web site? I think 
you should come to my web site, of course. But most of the major airlines 
have it. I think you can go to the travel office and do E-ticket processes. 
But the deals are out there. You can call whichever airline you think 
offers non-stop. How has this changed, the business of finding cheaper 
air fares with the advent of the Internet? And I should ask as a back-up 
question, how is the travel agent business hurting, if at all? Well, 
I think the travel agent's an important key to what we do in travel, 
but the Internet's also a fun place. Our web site, bestfares.com, 
we've put up as many as 80 do 100 stories a day. We look at the rules. 
You've got other web sites that help the consumer become more educated 
on what the lowest published fares may be between one destination 
and another, and they do their home work without relying on the airlines 
or the travel agent, and so they're more savvy when talking to the 
travel agent. I think all are important keys to cheap travel, though. 
Thanks for coming in. Let your holiday begin. Appreciate your time.
