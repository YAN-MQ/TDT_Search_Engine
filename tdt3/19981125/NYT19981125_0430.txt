On his 84th birthday, a day spent with close family, Joe DiMaggio 
finally agreed to acknowledge that he had a cancerous tumor removed 
from his right lung. ``Early on, he's telling me, `Don't tell the 
world about cancer,''' said Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's longtime 
friend, spokesman and lawyer. ``It's a scary word for his generation.'' 
In making periodic announcements about DiMaggio's condition, Engelberg 
had complied. DiMaggio, who has been in Memorial Regional Hospital 
since Oct. 12, relented after Engelberg convinced him that his surgery 
has become public knowledge and that Dr. Luis Asanza's operation on 
Oct. 14 had successfully removed the cancer. ``The reason he's in 
the hospital past the first 10 days is not the tumor,'' Engelberg 
said Wednesday at his law offices here. ``It's because of pneumonia. 
And one lung is cleared up, the other lung is on the way. ``The cancer 
did not spread to his liver. It did not spread to his kidneys. It 
did not spread to his head. There is no chemotherapy planned. They 
say for safety, they may have some radiation.'' Dr. Earl Barron, the 
lead doctor among six physicians who have been treating DiMaggio, 
told The Associated Press that ``The prognosis for his recovery is 
good. For a while, it was touch and go, but he has been showing steady 
improvement.'' From Engelberg's perspective, DiMaggio felt feisty 
enough Wednesday to show anger over an early morning CNN report that 
he had had a heart attack. ``It's hard for him to speak because of 
this thing in his throat that helps him breathe,'' Engelberg said. 
``It's coming out Friday or Monday at the latest. But he was sitting 
there watching TV, and he's getting angry.'' Earlier, Engelberg said, 
he had shielded DiMaggio from televised reports that said the legendary 
center fielder had suffered a heart attack last week. ``I asked Dr. 
Barron today, `Did Joe have a heart attack?''' Engelberg said. ``And 
he looked at Joe and told him, `No, you didn't have a heart attack.''' 
The main concern about DiMaggio's health now centers on his continuing 
struggle with pneumonia. DiMaggio's early morning birthday celebration 
included his brother Dom; granddaughter Paula; her husband, Jim; their 
daughters, Vanessa, 11, and Valerie, 9, and Barron and some hospital 
staff members. Afterward, Engelberg said the medical staff told him 
and the family that DiMaggio would likely spend three to five more 
weeks in the hospital. ``Then they qualified it,'' he said. ``They 
said anything can happen in medicine. It's up to God. Tomorrow morning, 
anything could happen.'' Engelberg said DiMaggio appeared to be suffering 
months before he was hospitalized. ``He didn't feel well,'' Engelberg 
said. ``He wasn't eating. He lost 15 pounds.'' In early October in 
Chicago, DiMaggio was to be honored by the National Pan American Sports 
Hall of Fame. The final night there, over dinner, DiMaggio confided 
to Engelberg that he did not feel well and wanted to go back to his 
hotel room. ``Joe is fiercely independent,'' Engelberg said. ``He'll 
never let you help him out of a car or anything. But getting up from 
the dinner table, he let Tommy Lasorda help him up. That really showed 
me how sick he was.'' The following morning, DiMaggio and Engelberg 
caught a 5 a.m. flight to New York for Joe DiMaggio Day at Yankee 
Stadium. ``We went through the whole routine at Yankee Stadium,'' 
Engelberg said. ``I could see how sick he was, but he couldn't turn 
them down. In the third inning he had to leave.'' Engelberg flew to 
Fort Lauderdale the next morning to catch up on a mountain of work. 
He said DiMaggio felt so poorly that he stayed over a day. Engelberg 
said that on Oct. 12, he insisted that DiMaggio check into a hospital. 
``He couldn't have gone another week,'' Engelberg said. ``But he was 
going to try to go to the World Series. I actually talked him out 
of it. He couldn't fly with pneumonia.'' After the tumor was removed 
two days later, DiMaggio began to show complications from pneumonia. 
On Nov. 16 DiMaggio's blood pressure suddenly dropped 30 points, according 
to Engelberg. He said Barron told him the next six hours would determine 
DiMaggio's fate. ``I arranged for a priest to be called,'' Engelberg 
said. The next morning, Engelberg arrived at the hospital at 5 a.m. 
DiMaggio's brother showed up 30 minutes later. ``Nobody could sleep,'' 
Engelberg said. ``We get there and he's sitting up getting a shave. 
I said, `You're the great Joe D.' I thought he was going to die. Dr. 
Barron said to me, `It just shows you it's not medicine, it's God.'''
