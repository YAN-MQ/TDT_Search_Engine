The Turkish government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has been toppled 
by a vote of no confidence in parliament. Opposition parties brought 
the motion over allegations of corruption and ties to organized crime. 
President Demirel has started to consult with party leaders on the 
formation of a new government. No Turkish party is strong enough to 
form a government without coalition partners.
