Britain's highest court ruled Wednesday that Gen. Augusto Pinochet 
does not have immunity from arrest, meaning the former Chilean dictator 
must remain under police guard while Spain seeks his extradition on 
charges of murder, torture and genocide. The 3-2 majority decision 
by a five-judge tribunal of the House of Lords, delivered on Pinochet's 
83rd birthday, overturned a High Court ruling that Pinochet's arrest 
Oct. 16 was illegal because he had immunity under English law for 
actions taken as a foreign former head of state. The Spanish government 
and Spanish and British prosecutors had appealed the Oct. 28 High 
Court judgment. A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people 
were murdered or disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after 
he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. Pinochet now must 
appear before Bow Street Magistrates' Court in London on Dec. 2, the 
deadline by which Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide whether extradition 
proceedings can go ahead. Pinochet's best hope is that Straw will 
block the Spanish extradition proceedings, which would mean that extradition 
requests lodged by Switzerland, France and other countries also would 
likely fall away. If Straw gives the go-ahead, Pinochet faces a long 
battle through the British courts against extradition. Key issues 
in the appeal were whether international law and custom _ including 
trials of Rwanda Hutus and Bosnian Serbs for genocide and war crimes, 
and Britain's 1988 adoption of a U.N. Convention on Torture _ override 
this country's sweeping State Immunity Act passed in 1978. Prosecutors' 
lawyers argued that Pinochet's alleged crimes were beyond immunity. 
Pinochet supporters looked stunned at the judgment, which delighted 
international human rights organizations and many Chileans both at 
home and in exile. The general and his wife, Lucia, heard the news 
_ broadcast live on British television _ in his room at the Grovelands 
Priory, the north London hospital where he had remained under police 
guard awaiting news of his fate. Pinochet underwent back surgery Oct. 
9 during a regular visit to Britain and was arrested in his bed at 
another hospital.
