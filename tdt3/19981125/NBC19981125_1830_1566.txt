Consider there, during the Christmas shopping season, there are 100,000 
different toys available. The toy industry estimates the average child 
gets about $350 worth of toys. And, of course, every year there's 
the toy -- the one that rules all the others, whatever the price. 
Tonight, NBC's Kelly O'Donnell on the great furby Hunt. The endangered 
species of this holiday shopping season -- a new breed of toy. This 
year's hottest and hardest to find -- furby. They're very hard to 
find. My mom hasn't found one yet, but I really want one. What is 
furby? An interactive pet that responds to human contact and learns 
to speak up to 800 phrases in English. But it can't tell you where 
to find one. Unfortunately, we are sold out through the holiday season. 
Furby, furby. It's been just eight weeks since furby debuted. The 
toymaker says it shipped more than 1,3 million of them to stores across 
the country. But apparently that's still not enough. Can I get on 
the waiting list? Are you still taking the waiting list? As you can 
see, the list kind of goes on. This store stopped taking names after 
1,500 signed up. Back in the stockroom, every furby here is already 
spoken for, going to someone on the list. They'll never be on display 
in the store because they're sold before they ever make it there. 
If the search fails, at store after store, desperate parents on a 
Mission to find the hottest toys have another way to go for those 
willing to spend more, sometimes a lot more, than the retail price. 
On line auctions promise furby to the highest bidder. Some offer hundreds 
for the $35 toy. What are you looking for today? Furby. But others 
take a low-tech approach. Furby. Hours standing in long lines. Still, 
some prefer an old favorite with a new look -- Harley Barbie. This 
Harley Barbie was the main reason I was here. Will furby have Barbie's 
lasting appeal or just be another passing fad? Furby's maker is quick 
to dispel any notion the company engineered an artificial shortage, 
claiming it produced more furbys than stores ordered and didn't anticipate 
this much demand. For my grandchildren. I think it's great, you know. 
This will make their Christmas. If not, it'll make mine because I 
found them. For many, the great toy quest has become another family 
tradition where the pursuit can be as much about the grown-UPS' needs 
as the child's wishes. Kelly O'Donnell, NBC news, Los Angeles.
