It's time to prepare the Thanksgiving Turkey, and consumer groups 
have some tips to help conquer bacteria that could be hiding in your 
holiday feast. The center for science in the public interest recommends 
you -- defrost frozen Turkey in the refrigerator, allowing one day 
for every five pounds. If it's too late for that and you use a microwave 
to defrost, cook the turkey as soon as it is thawed. Remember to wash 
your hands, work surfaces, and any utensils touched by raw poultry 
with hot, soapy water. Cook the Turkey until no pink juices run out. 
And use a meat thermometer to make sure the thick part of the thigh 
reaches 180 degrees, and the center of the stuffing reaches 165 degrees. 
Even better, cook the stuffing on the stove or in the oven, separate 
from the Turkey. After you serve the meal, don't let food sit out 
longer than two hours. And if you have leftovers, make sure to throw 
them out after two or three days. Check out CNN.com/health for the
