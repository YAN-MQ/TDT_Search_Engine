"CNN Headline News," I'm Chuck Roberts. Jack Kevorkian is at a Michigan 
police station, to be booked on a charge of first-degree murder. Prosecutors 
in Oakland county, Michigan, announced the felony indictment after 
watching a videotape they got from "60 minutes." It shows Kevorkian 
administering a fatal dose of drugs to a 52-year-old man with Lou 
Gehrig's disease. "60 minutes" broadcast parts of the tape Sunday. 
The three counts against Kevorkian are first-degree murder, criminal 
assistance of a suicide and delivery of a controlled substance. Not 
withstanding public sentiment on the issue of assisted suicide, it's 
incumbent upon me to make charging decisions solely on the law and 
not emotion or sympathy. In this case, there's an obvious violation 
of the law that I will not turn my back to. Kevorkian has been tried 
and acquitted three times. This is the first case in which he actually 
administered the lethal dose of drugs.
