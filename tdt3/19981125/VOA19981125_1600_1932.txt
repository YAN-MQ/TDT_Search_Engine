The Turkish government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has been toppled 
by a vote of non-confidence in parliament. Opposition parties brought 
the motion over allegations of corruption and ties to organized crime. 
President Demirel has started to consult with party leaders on formation 
of a new government. No Turkish party is strong enough to form a government 
without coalition partners.
