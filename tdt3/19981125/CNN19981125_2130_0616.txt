There's a revolution going on in Romania, and although it doesn't 
involve a Political movement, mobility is the key. Allard beutel has 
the story. Marius filip is an orthopedic surgeon who works at University 
hospital in bucharest, Romania. It's one of the country's most-modern, 
government-run medical facilities. But it's far below the standard 
of major western countries. So filip contacted a cellular telephone 
company in Romania called connex and made an offer it couldn't refuse. 
In return, those doctors are on call, 24-7 to all connex employees. 
It's cutting time and money. It's going very fast, connects people 
very quickly. And we can give them a diagnosis and treatment in a 
very short period of time. He hopes his plan will help encourage international 
confidence in romania. But change won't come easily. This Belgian 
couple decided to be airlifted back home for the wife's reconstructive 
surgery rather than be treated in Romania. Seeing all the patients 
in the corridors, I assume they're a little bit overwhelmed. I've 
never seen so many people in a hospital. But people at connex are 
very happy with their medical treatment at University hospital. This 
connex employee says his level of care was a lot different before 
joining the company. "First of all, you had to wait a long time to 
find out where to go and who to see. And secondly, you had to pay 
for good, quality medical services." For decades, it's been difficult 
for romanians to get telephone service. Cell phone companies now are 
changing that. With our connex go, you can walk in and get a package 
and hook up immediately. And immediacy through technology is at the 
heart of this cell phone arrangement. Doctor filip says the program 
is working so well they're considering plans to open it to other companies 
and the public. Allard beutel, CNN.
