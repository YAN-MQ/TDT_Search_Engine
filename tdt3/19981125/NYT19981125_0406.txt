It was an accident of politics that put Peter Burleigh in the U.S. 
chair this fall when the Security Council grappled in its inimitably 
ponderous way through crises in Kosovo and then Iraq. An Asian and 
Middle East specialist, Burleigh was little known beyond the Foreign 
Service when Bill Richardson left the top job at the U.S. Mission 
in August to become energy secretary and the Clinton administration 
ran into trouble with the nomination of his would-be successor, Richard 
Holbrooke. Burleigh had been the mission's No. 2 diplomat (a slot 
traditionally reserved for a career officer preferably with experience 
in the Middle East) for a year before he stepped in as charge d'affaires. 
He was Richardson's choice as a deputy, an assignment Burleigh now 
describes as ``harder and better'' than he expected. ``I got called 
in the middle of the night in Colombo and asked if I would come the 
next day for an interview with Bill Richardson in Washington,'' said 
Burleigh, who was then U.S. ambassador in Sri Lanka. ``I foolishly 
agreed.'' It was February 1997. ``We hit it off, Richardson and I, 
which continued here,'' Burleigh said. ``I'm a big fan, even though 
we are wildly different kinds of people. He was an easy boss to work 
for.'' Since then, Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein and Peter Burleigh 
himself have done much to raise the acting U.S. representative's profile 
at the United Nations. Fate seems determined to snare Burleigh in 
the long-playing Iraqi story. Before the Persian Gulf War in 1991, 
he was selected to become the next ambassador to Iraq. From 1985 to 
1987, he had been in charge of Iraqi and Iranian affairs at the State 
Department, and in 1987 had moved up to deputy assistant secretary 
of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs. In these weeks 
of crisis, Burleigh has become a popular figure around the United 
Nations, not least because of his ability to poke fun at himself and 
his anonymity. When he spoke recently at the 50th anniversary dinner 
of the U.N. Correspondents' Association, he spun a story about how 
thrilled he was when he returned, exhausted, to his office one evening 
to find the association's invitation. It was addressed to Richardson. 
``But I read on, and was truly heartened to read these words,'' he 
said. ``In the event that Ambassador Richardson has moved on, as he 
inevitably will, to even greater things, we would be more than honored 
by the presence of the internationally acclaimed and respected diplomat 
Richard C. Holbrooke.'' ``If they can't make it, please send that 
other guy. The one with the bow tie,'' said Burleigh, who is famous 
for his colorful ties. (An aide said that ``every time he gets stressed 
he buys another one.'') ``I have no idea how many bow ties I have,'' 
Burleigh answered before being asked. He said he buys them all, handmade, 
from Beau Ties Ltd., a small mail-order company in Middlebury, Vt. 
And he keeps instructions in his office to fax to people who want 
to know why he never fails to tie a perfect bow. Albert Peter Burleigh, 
56, is a Californian who first developed an interest in South Asia 
when he joined the Peace Corps and was sent to Nepal after graduating 
from Colgate. He later returned to Katmandu as a Fulbright scholar. 
Nepali is one of the South Asian languages he now speaks fluently, 
along with Bengali, Hindi and Sinhalese. After joining the Foreign 
Service, he served in the U.S. embassies in Nepal, India, Bahrain 
and finally Sri Lanka. He has also been the State Department's coordinator 
for the Office of Counterterrorism and principal deputy assistant 
secretary of state for intelligence and research. Fellow diplomats 
say Burleigh's biggest problem in the Security Council, of which he 
is president for the month of November, is lack of political footing 
in the Clinton White House. That appears to limit his role to delivering 
Washington's messages rather than helping to form policy. His sideline 
role was evident recently as Washington took 24 hours longer than 
most members to join the Security Council consensus on Iraq and give 
Saddam a chance to prove he really means to cooperate with arms inspectors. 
Other diplomats said Burleigh spent a lot of time working phones and 
waiting for instructions. ``So would anyone who would be in the job, 
because of the high seriousness of the issues,'' Burleigh said. He 
added that he had been treated ``extremely well'' and kept in the 
loop through video conference calls with both Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``I don't believe 
being a career diplomat is the kind of damaging characteristic that 
a lot of people have commented on, in at least some ways,'' he said.
