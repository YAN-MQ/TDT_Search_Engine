Betty Kavata's battered face contorted in pain as she shouted gibberish 
from a hospital bed in a video broadcast on Kenyan TV last week. Brain 
damaged and paralyzed by a man her sister identified as her battering 
husband, Kavata is one of many women abused by men who claim a traditional 
right to discipline their wives. With the motto ``Women's rights are 
human rights,'' the Coalition on Violence Against Women on Wednesday 
launched a global 16-day campaign to eradicate gender-based violence. 
It's an uphill struggle. Wife-beating is common throughout Kenya, 
and sociologists and criminologists say it has doubled in the past 
decade and is rising, partly because of Kenya's worsening economic 
situation. Largely to blame are Kenya's outdated and discriminatory 
laws, said Hilda Mawanda, coalition administrator. Wife-beating and 
marital rape are not crimes, but men can be charged with the lesser 
crime of assault, the coalition said. The coalition urged the government 
to discard laws that discriminate against women, to make wife-beating 
illegal, and guarantee women's complaints are properly investigated 
and prosecuted. ``Many forms of violence against women that manifest 
themselves through customary law practices are legally sanctioned 
in the supreme law of the land, the Constitution,'' said Ann Nyabera 
of the Federation of Women Lawyers. Kenyan law, for example, discriminates 
against women in the areas of personal law, property, burial, inheritance, 
adoption and marriage, and allows practices including child marriages, 
female genital mutilation, polygamy and denying a widow inheritance, 
she said. If enacted, legal reforms also must be enforced, the coalition 
said. Male-dominated police forces often refuse to intervene in battery 
cases, saying they are private affairs, it said. Data on abused women 
is frequently unavailable. Police don't log domestic battery or rape 
separately from incidents outside the home, making it difficult to 
track domestic violence. In 1997, a survey of 260 people commissioned 
by FIDA found that 94 percent those questioned in Nairobi and all 
of those in rural Kajiado said women in their community were beaten. 
FIDA receives 50 new cases each week, 45 of which involve domestic 
violence. The majority of women don't come forward. ``Most battered 
women today in Kenya are still living in that code of silence,'' said 
Adelina Mwau, coalition chairwoman. ``Women still define themselves 
in terms of a man. She's someone's daughter, someone's wife, someone's 
sister.'' Lena Kadeha, 37, said she suffered for more than a decade 
with her abusive husband. He called her a prostitute, broke her glasses 
and pounded her eyes so that she wouldn't ``look at other men,'' and 
beat her for not ironing his clothes when the electricity was out. 
Finally, he beat her in front of her mother-in-law and the small, 
soft-spoken nurse and mother of five told him ``no more.'' ``I realized 
no one can change my life but me,'' Kadeha said. Betty Kavata didn't 
get out on time. Her husband, a police officer, has been suspended 
from duty, but no charges have been brought against him. ``We have 
a long way to go,'' Mwau said.
