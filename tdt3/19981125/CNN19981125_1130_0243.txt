Human rights advocates and Chilean exiles are celebrating today after 
britain's highest court upheld the arrest of former Chilean dictator 
augusto Pinochet. The three to two vote by a house of lords panel 
was greeted with champagne and dancing in the street. Pinochet's fate 
now lies with Britain's home secretary who could release pinochet 
for humanitarian reasons or refer his case to Britain's courts for 
possible extradition to Spain. Pinochet is charged with torture, genocide 
and murder. The Chilean government says nearly 3,200 people were killed 
or disappeared during Pinochet's regime.
