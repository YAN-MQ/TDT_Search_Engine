Lens knocked English titlist Arsenal out of the Champions Cup with 
a 1-0 victory at Wembley Wednesday. Mikel Debeve scored in the 72nd 
minute and the French club will face Dynamo Kiev in two weeks time 
to decide who wins Group E and makes it to the last eight. Arsenal 
was missing suspended Emmanuel Petit and injured Patrick Vieira and 
Dennis Bergkamp and was generally outplayed by the French team after 
making most of the early running. Lens defenders Cyrille Magnier and 
Erik Sikora made important blocks to prevent Christophe Wreh and Nicolas 
Anelka firing the Gunners ahead early in the game. Wreh also fired 
over the top from a good position before Lens began to move menacingly 
forward and Arsenal 'keeper David Seaman did well to a block a powerful 
shot from Vladimir Smicer. The only goal of the game came 18 minutes 
from the end when Smicer crossed from the end and Debeve fired the 
ball home from what looked an offside position. Arsenal midfielder 
Ray Parlour was sent off in the final minute for striking out at Cyril 
Rool and he was followed a minute later by Tony Vairelles for a foul 
challenge on Lee Dixon.
