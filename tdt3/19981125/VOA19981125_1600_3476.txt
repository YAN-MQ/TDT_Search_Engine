A new movie set in Thailand will have to be filmed outside of Thailand. 
The movie is "Anna and the King." Its story was filmed in the 1940s 
under the title "Anna and the King of Siam." It's inspired by a true 
story and may be best known for its stage and screen musical version, 
"The King and I." The story concerns the relationship between a British 
teacher and the strong willed King of Thailand, formerly known as 
Siam, in the 19th century. Thailand objects to the film, accusing 
it of showing disrespect for the king. So Thailand is refusing to 
let the new movie be filmed there. Instead, the cast and crew for 
"Anna and the King" will film in Malaysia.
