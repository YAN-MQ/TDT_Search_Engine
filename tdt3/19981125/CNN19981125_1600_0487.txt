I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"CNN Headline News" forecast. Windy, wet and snow is what you can 
expect in the northwest later today. We're going to see rain along 
the frontal boundary from the Great Lakes southward. That rain will 
be pushing toward the east coast by Thanksgiving day. The central 
section of the country for Thanksgiving looking nice with high pressure 
and mild temperatures. That winter storm system moving very slowly 
in the northwest. High temperatures for today, very mild other than 
the northern plains and the northeast where we'll see highs only in 
the 30s. Your extended forecast showing cold temperatures in the extreme 
northern U.S. on Friday. Rain with showers in the west. Windy conditions 
in the east. On Saturday, snow and rain throughout the western third 
of the country with mild temperatures over most of the U.S. on Sunday,
