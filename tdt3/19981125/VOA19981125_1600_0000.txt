Britain's high court says former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet 
cannot have immunity for crimes committed while serving as a head 
of state. We'll go to Santiago for the stunned reaction from Chileans. 
The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, says rebels in Sierra Leone have been 
intensifying their campaign of terror against civilians. Two newspapers 
say Libya has tried and jailed three top intelligence officials in 
an action related to the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, 
Scotland. We'll also learn why a decision this week by America's attorney 
general is boosting Vice President Al Gore's chances for a run at 
the White House in the year 2000. I'm Tony Riggs. And I'm Erin Brummett. 
We'll have the -- those stories and much more in this hour of VOA 
News Now. First, a summary of world news.
