In India, the polls are open for voting in four state elections today. 
Analysts say the elections are a test of popularity for the eight-month-old 
government of the Bharatiya Janata Party. VOA New Delhi Correspondent 
Douglas Baction reports. Voters are electing state assemblies in Rajasthan, 
Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, and the remote province of Mizoram. Tight security 
is in effect to guard against any violence. Voter apathy has been 
a factor. Some voters say that no matter what party they choose, the 
government does not deliver basic services to the people. No party 
is doing anything for anybody, for any public. Either it is BJP or 
Congress. Both corrupt. Opinion polls say the BJP is expected to lose 
in Rajasthan and Delhi, while the Congress Party is expected to lose 
in Madhya Pradesh. The outcome in the small state of Mizoram is not 
considered significant. Analysts say the BJP losses would deal a psychological 
blow to the party but not directly affect the federal government.
