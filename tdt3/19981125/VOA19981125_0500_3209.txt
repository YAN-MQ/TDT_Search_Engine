The New York-based rock band Goo Goo Dolls spent more than a decade 
trying to achieve commercial successful. During that time, the group 
recorded five albums that brought the members critical acclaim but 
few hit songs. Well, as VOA's Mary Morningstar reports now, that has 
all changed with the release of the Goo Goo Dolls' sixth and latest 
collection called "Dizzy Up the Girl." And I don't want the world 
to see me / 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand / When everything's 
made to be broken / I just want you to know who I am... The Goo Goo 
Dolls' record company once referred to the group as America's best 
unknown band. A regional favorite in upstate New York, the Goo Goo 
Dolls have finally earned their big break with the hit single "Iris." 
The song, which is among 13 tracks on the group's new album, "Dizzy 
Up the Girl," was also featured on the motion picture soundtrack to 
"City of Angels." "Iris" is number one on "Billboard"'s top 100 air 
play chart where it's held the top spot for 17 weeks. Goo Goo Dolls' 
bassist Robbie Takac talks about the song's mainstream appeal. I think 
the music is not that far away from what we normally do as a band, 
but it's done with much different instrumentation, you know. It's 
done with acoustic guitars and things like that, as opposed to the 
normal electric sound that we have. So I think it was a little bit 
easier on people's ears as far as an introduction to the band goes. 
Along with bassist Robbie Takac, the Goo Goo Dolls features lead singer 
and guitarist Johnny Rzeznick and drummer Mike Malinin. The group 
formed in the mid-1980s in Buffalo, New York. Then following the 1987 
release of its self-titled debut album, the band moved to Los Angeles. 
Eight years later, the Goo Goo Dolls appeared on the pop charts for 
the first time with the top-five single, "Name." And now we're grownup 
orphans / That never knew their names / We don't belong to no one 
/ That's a shame / But you could hide beside me / Maybe for a while 
/ And I won't tell 'em your name / And I won't tell 'em your name... 
The Goo Goo Dolls toured for two years in support of their 1995 album 
"A Boy Named Goo," which featured the hit single "Name." After a break 
from live concerts, the group returned to the studio this year to 
record its long-awaited follow-up CD "Dizzy Up the Girl." The collection 
recently debuted at number 17 on "Billboard"'s top 200 chart. Although 
it's been a long road to success for the band, Robbie Takac says the 
Goo Goo Dolls have benefited from the wait. It was a school process 
for us because we didn't know what we were doing, you know, back when 
we started. If we would have had the success then that we worked, 
then we wouldn't have been able to exist as we do now. As people and 
as musicians involved with the music industry, it's taken us a long 
time to learn just how to do it. The Goo Goo Dolls are currently promoting 
their new album "Dizzy Up the Girl" with concerts throughout the United 
States. While the band's single, "Iris," is a favorite on top 40 radio 
stations, its latest single, "Slide," is enjoying similar success 
on the modern rock chart. I'm Mary Morningstar. Could you whisper 
in my ear / The things you want to feel / I'll give ya anythin' / 
To feel it comin' / Do you wake up on your own / And wonder where 
you are / You live with all your faults / I wanna wake up where you 
are / I won't say anything at all...
