Two newspapers say Libya has tried and jailed three top intelligence 
officials in an action related to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am airliner 
over Lockerbie, Scotland. The British daily, "The Guardian," and the 
Arabic newspaper, "Al-Hayat," quote Libyan sources as saying the three 
men were convicted of dereliction of duty and sentenced to seven- 
and five-year prison terms. The three Libyans held key security positions 
at the time of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The two newspapers 
suggest that jailing the three men was aimed at preventing their testimony 
at a trial of two Libyan agents. The agents are accused by the United 
States and Britain of carrying out the 1988 bombing. The pair are 
to be extradited by Libya to The Netherlands for trial by Scottish 
judges. It's part of the United Nations deal to lift sanctions imposed 
on Libya in 1992.
