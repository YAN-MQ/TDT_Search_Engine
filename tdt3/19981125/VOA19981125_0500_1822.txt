Hello again. I'm Charlene Porter along with Paul Westpheling on VOA 
News now. The U.N. Security Council has discussed the latest dispute 
between Iraq and U.N. weapons inspectors but has reached no consensus 
on how to respond to Iraq's refusal to hand over documents requested 
by chief arms inspector Richard Butler. Instead, the Council expressed 
continued full support for the U.N. Special Commission in charge of 
scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The United States, which 
almost launched air strikes against Iraq during an earlier standoff 
this month, says it's watching this situation closely. At this point, 
U.S. officials seem willing to test Baghdad's overall compliance with 
U.N. demands before making new threats of military strikes. VOA's 
Nick Senione reports. Earlier this month, in the hours after the United 
States called off plans to bomb Iraq, President Clinton made clear 
that, as part of Baghdad's renewed decision to cooperate with inspections, 
it would be required to produce all weapons-related documents. That 
isn't happening. Faced with another act of non-compliance, President 
Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart refused to tell reporters what Iraqi 
actions would trigger a military response. Instead, he indicated the 
administration wants to review Baghdad's pledge to cooperate with 
U.N. arms inspectors in a range of areas beyond the issue of handing 
over documents. There are a lot of serious of issues that Iraq is 
going to have to affirmatively prove that they will cooperate with 
in order to make UNSCOM effective, and if they do not, if they are 
not able to demonstrate, then we certainly will have to make a judgment, 
and it certainly leaves open the option of a military strike. Even 
though there have been no new reports of weapons inspectors being 
blocked from specific sites in Iraq, spokesman Lockhart says the Clinton 
administration remains very skeptical of Iraq's intentions. Still 
in the Persian Gulf is sufficient U.S. military power to carry out 
a sudden strike against Iraq if the president would order it. Nick 
Senione, VOA News, at the White House.
