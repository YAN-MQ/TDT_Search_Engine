Finally this evening, the alternative Thanksgiving dinner. The national 
Turkey federation tells us that 90% of Americans will have turkey 
for lunch or dinner tomorrow. Not that they're pushing Turkey, of 
course. ABC's Morton dean on the other hand knows that there's also 
tofu. Whether any pilgrims took pride in being vegetarians is not 
known. So, it's safe to assume that preparing dinner for guests on 
that first thanksgiving probably was easier on the hosts than it is 
now. Turkey, Nancy? It doesn't appeal to me. It's revolting. There 
are many thousands of Americans, not unlike 11-year-old nancy Pyne, 
who say you can take a Turkey and, well, stuff it. I'm cooking my 
own stir fried tofu thing and bringing it with me in a Tupperware 
box. On this meat-oriented holiday, more and more Americans seem to 
be searching for meatless alternatives. How about a tofurkey? It's 
mainly tofu. And in major supermarkets this year for the first time. 
It looks like a turkry. Will it taste like a Turkey? It should taste 
a little like a Turkey. And if a tofurkey doesn't make your mouth 
water, what about an unturkey? It's mostly wheat gluten. When you 
cut into it, it actually looks like a real Turkey. There's even sections 
that look like light meat and dark meat. Even most restaurants now 
cater to vegetarian tastes on thanksgiving day. New York's four seasons. 
We have roasted peppers, broccoli, carrot, snow peas. We have cous 
cous, spinach. We have a little pumpkin and cranberries right on top 
of it. But what happens if all those vegetarian delights share a table 
with a traditional Turkey? What do you do then? I'm going to sit as 
far away from it as I can. And with so many vegetarians around the 
Thanksgiving dinner table these days, she won't be lonely. Morton 
dean, ABC News, New York.
