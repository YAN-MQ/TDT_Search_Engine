Some airlines are taking the crackdown on carry-on luggage a step 
further. Lori Waffenschmidt has details in this "working ahead" report. 
United and Delta airlines are trying to keep their flight attendants 
from having to be bag police. The airlines are installing baggage 
templates at security checkpoints in airports across the country -- 
Delta in about 12, united in 60 airports -- by early 1999. We think 
it'll do the things we want it to do, which is to improve on-time 
departure performance and also create a hassle-free environment in 
the boarding process for the passenger. This demonstration video from 
united shows what happens when an item doesn't fit. Oh, I don't believe 
it. I always carry this bag on board with me. It won't fit through 
the template, I'm going to have to check it to your final destination. 
If next time you don't pack it so full, I think it will fit through. 
Solid items that don't fit through the 9-inch by 14-inch opening will 
need to be checked. But soft large items are likely to make the cut. 
Car seats and medical AIDS, such as crutches, are exceptions to the 
rule. Critics insist the new system will bring new problems. One is 
that there are going to be increased delays at security as people 
are caught unawares by the fact that they can't get through with a 
larger bag. Two, there's a question as to whether or not the airlines 
are going to be able to handle the increase in checked baggage. And 
continental airlines has filed suit against Delta over the templates. 
The two carriers share baggage screening devices at San Diego international 
airport. And continental doesn't want its passengers bags restricted. 
It's built larger overhead storage bins. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN, 
reporting.
