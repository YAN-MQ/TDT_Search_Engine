Turkey has denied that it's launched an official boycott of Italian 
products because of the dispute over its request for the extradition 
of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. Turkey's representative to 
the European Union issued the statement after EU Commissioner President 
Jacques Santer said a formal boycott would violate EU agreements. 
It said many Turks on their own are boycotting Italian products to 
show anger at Italy's refusal to hand over the Kurdish rebel leader. 
Italian law forbids extradition of anyone to a country that has the 
death penalty. Italy sought and received European Union support for 
its stand. The Turkish government wants Abdullah Ocalan to stand trial 
for terrorism. His Kurdistan Workers Party has been fighting 14 years 
for a Kurdish homeland in Southeast Turkey.
