We're going to take "A closer look" at teenage power this evening. 
We don't mean to be particularly commercial on the eve of Thanksgiving, 
but as we all know once we have given thanks, this particular weekend 
is renowned for its shopping. And no matter where you shop, you will 
not be able to miss the fact that it's the younger consumer who's 
the important one. First here is ABC's Jane Clayson. Ask any teenager 
at any mall in America and they will tell you what it means to shop. 
It's just a need. It's just the want to spend. Money Burns your pockets 
so you just have to spend. And spend they do. How much do you spend 
every week? Around $40. My friends probably spend $150 a week. Kids 
are spending record amounts of money, an average of $75 a Week. That's 
a staggering $100 billion of disposable income every year. Two times 
what teens spent just a decade ago. Where is it all coming from? Most 
kids still get their money the old-fashioned way, odd jobs, gifts 
and allowances. But they are also responsible for spending more of 
their parents money. With two-career families, kids are now entrusted 
with, what used to be, adult buying decisions. They're going to the 
food stores, they're going to the mass merchandisers and they're buying 
things for the households. They're having an influence over what sort 
of automobiles are purchased for the family, what sort of vacations. 
It is a fundamental shift in buying power. And retailers, especially, 
are capitalizing on it. Stores catering to preteen and teenaged shoppers 
are popping up all over the country. Last year, "the limited too," 
reinvented itself with psychedelic decor and makeup counters that 
cater to 12-year-olds. Company profits surged almost 25%. All of our 
communications before were directed to the parent. And we decided 
that relevantly the most influential person here is the girl. And 
so now, all our communication is directed to the girl. You're pretty 
expert on this store? Advertisers, too, are marketing, not to parent, 
but directly to kids. What will all of this mean for a new generation 
of spenders? They will be the most sophisticated group of consumers 
this country has seen. In many ways, they already are. Jane Clayson, 
ABC News, Los Angeles.
