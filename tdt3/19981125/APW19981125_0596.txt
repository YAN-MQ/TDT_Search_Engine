Russia can't afford to feed meat to its military conscripts, so it's 
fallen back on the next best thing: hunting licenses. Border guards 
in the northern district of Karelia have been granted 120 free hunting 
licenses that will allow them to hunt elk for food this winter, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Wednesday. The report noted that the 
same ploy was used with border guards in Russia's Far East last winter, 
and they were able to stock up on plenty of meat. In Karelia, special 
brigades of up to 12 border are being formed to go on hunting expeditions. 
The guards are supposed to use hunting rifles, not their military 
weapons, authorities said. The report also said guards in Russia's 
Arctic regions are using snares to catch hares and partridges. It 
said the servicemen have not received meat, fish or butter in their 
regular military diets for the past three months. The head of the 
Arctic border guard department, Maj. Gen. Anatoly Koretsky, said special 
groups had been formed in all border guard units to fish and to forage 
for mushrooms and berries.
