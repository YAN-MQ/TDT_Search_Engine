Actor Michael J. fox says he has had Parkinson's disease for the past 
seven years. In an interview with "people" magazine, fox says he underwent 
brain surgery last March to help reduce the tremors associated with 
the disorder. Parkinson's disease is a Progressive degeneration of 
the central nervous system. Fox, who is 37, says he first was diagnosed 
in 1991 when he noticed an unusual twitch in a finger. He says surgery 
eliminated the worst tremors and drug treatment is controlling the 
milder ones. Parkinson's has no known cause or cure.
