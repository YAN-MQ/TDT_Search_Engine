Weeping with joy over a day they thought would never come, opponents 
of Augusto Pinochet welcomed a British ruling Wednesday upholding 
his arrest for possible extradition to Spain and trial on charges 
of genocide. ``It is a very important day for all humanity, not just 
for Chileans,'' said Ana Maria Gonzalez, a 45-year-old who fled her 
native Chile after Pinochet seized power and who was among dozens 
who turned out in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol to hear the ruling 
on the radio. At a rally, there were shouts of ``extradition'' and 
``long live Chile without Pinochet!'' ``I have been waiting 23 years 
to see Pinochet brought to trial,'' said Santiago Oyarzo, who said 
he was tortured and held for over a year without a trial for giving 
a radical newspaper to a friend soon after Pinochet seized power. 
Up to 1,000 people gathered in the square later Wednesday waving banners 
that read: ``U.K. OK, Pinochet K.O.'' and singing the song ``Happy 
Birthday to You'' in reference to the coincidence that the British 
ruling fell on Pinochet's 83rd birthday. Pinochet was arrested in 
London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon 
who heads the effort to see the retired general tried for crimes against 
humanity allegedly committed during his 1973-1990 dictatorship. ``This 
is a giant step for humanity, and specifically for the people of Latin 
America,'' said Carlos Slepoy, an Argentine private attorney who has 
worked with Garzon. ``It is a breath of fresh air,'' Slepoy said, 
claiming that it put Spanish justice ``at the vanguard of human rights.'' 
Not that Spain's conservative government wants that reputation, given 
that the Pinochet case has already ruffled political relations with 
Chile and risks damaging lucrative trade ties and major Spanish investments. 
But equally keen to avoid accusations of obstructing justice, Prime 
Minister Jose Maria Aznar has repeated many times that Spain would 
respect all judicial decisions. ``We respect and we will adapt to 
these legal procedures,'' he said after the British ruling. Earlier 
he said he was confident that relations with Chile would remain good. 
Most other political parties welcomed the ruling, including Spain's 
main opposition Socialist party that called on the government to pressure 
for extradition.
