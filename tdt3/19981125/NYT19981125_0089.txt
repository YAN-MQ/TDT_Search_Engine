When Marc Andreessen and his fellow whiz kids from the University 
of Illinois arrived in Silicon Valley in 1994 to found Netscape Communications 
Corp., the brash new darling of the digerati was the antithesis of 
America Online, which was widely perceived as a shelter for technical 
``newbies'' unprepared for the brave new world of the Net. That the 
two are now on the brink of merging is a measure of how much the divide 
between Internet sophisticates and mere computer-using mortals has 
narrowed. This month's scheduled release of the movie ``You've Got 
Mail,'' a romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks and America 
Online, serves as final proof, if any were needed, that cyberspace 
has gone mainstream. But however sound the business sense of such 
a combination might be, the vestiges of the culture clash were reflected 
Monday in currents of dark humor circulating through the Internet. 
And the results could be anything but funny. It is a clash, say industry 
analysts, that could color the future of the two companies if their 
merger is completed as expected this week. ``I think AOL still has 
all the stigma that it always had, as far as image goes,'' Jamie Zawinski, 
a Netscape founder who now oversees part of the company's browser 
development, wrote in an e-mail message to a reporter Monday afternoon. 
Alluding to his own e-mail address, he wrote, ``My friends keep saying 
`jwz(AT)aol.com' and then laughing uncontrollably.'' Among the jibes 
making the electronic rounds were spoof lyrics meant to be sung to 
the tune ``The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down'': ``The lesson is 
you can't live long/ Unless you market to the clueless throng/The 
night they sold old Netscape down/And all the browsers went corporate 
...'' For their part, America Online partisans did not waste time 
crowing. ``The battle is over. AOL wins,'' announced a posting to 
one Internet news group. Such juvenile exchanges may be more of a 
throwback to the elitist sparring of times past than a harbinger of 
the future. But the very numbers that make the merger appealing also 
underscore the extent to which the two most potent icons of the Internet 
appeal to different audiences. According to the tracking firm NetRatings, 
the users of the two companies' Web sites only overlap by about 23 
percent Still, the more pressing question for many who would like 
to see Netscape's Navigator browser survive as a viable alternative 
to Microsoft's competing Internet Explorer is what America Online 
will do with the company's technology-development arm. Earlier this 
year, Netscape released the source code to its browser, allowing anyone 
to submit changes and new features. While the company had little to 
lose in the move, since it was also announcing free distribution of 
its Navigator browser, the gesture was greeted as a sign that Netscape's 
values were in the traditional open spirit of the Internet, which 
the geek elite believe is the best strategy for developing bug-free 
technology. Microsoft Corp., in contrast, epitomizes the closed, proprietary 
model of software development. James Love, director of the Washington-based 
Consumer Project on Technology, a group affiliated with Ralph Nader, 
said his organization would oppose the acquisition. ``We are interested 
in finding out how AOL will deal with Netscape's plans for support 
of its browser as an open-source product that can be freely distributed,'' 
Love said. ``This is a deceptively deep issue from a policy point 
of view.'' But America Online, based in Dulles, Va., perhaps most 
famous for its ubiquitous disks that pop up in everything from computer 
magazines to cereal boxes, has based its success on marketing prowess, 
not cutting-edge technology. ``AOL has been a driven and focused consumer 
marketing company,'' said Gene DeRose, president of Jupiter Communications, 
a New York-based consulting company. ``But they've had an uneasy relationship 
with technology. Steve Case has always said, `I don't care where the 
technology is; we just have to be where the action is.''' To those 
for whom Netscape continues to symbolize an alternative to Microsoft, 
the merger will probably never be quite palatable. Said David Cassell, 
an America Online critic who runs the AOLwatch mailing list: ``They're 
both huge corporations. Now it's going to be like watching Godzilla 
fight Mothra and not being sure who you're rooting for.'' NYT-11-23-98
