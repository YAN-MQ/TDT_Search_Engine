Mo Vaughn trades his red sox for a halo. Details coming up in "Headline 
Sports." For those who have always been attracted to power... Dodge 
Dakota has the only available V-8 in its class. Now when you buy select 
Dodge Dakota club cabs, you'll get a 230 horsepower magnum V-8 at 
no extra charge. Why would someone want a truck with this much power? 
We think it has something to do with their childhood. Adrenaline rushing. 
Hearts pounding. Heavy breathing. It's almost as much fun as your 
first date. Royal Caribbean. Like no vacation on earth.
