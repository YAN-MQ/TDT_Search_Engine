Light cigarettes may sound like they're healthier to smoke. But some 
opponents of the tobacco industry say the public is being misled. 
Kathleen Koch examines the issue. They are the cigarettes of choice 
for more than half of U.S. smokers -- labeled light or ultralight, 
consumers think they're healthier. Lower in tar and nicotine, just 
like it says on the pack. Like a lot of my friends, they smoke lights, 
because they think it's gonna help them quit, because they're getting 
less tar and less of the bad stuff. It's a little easier on your body, 
I guess. But senator Frank Lautenberg says those ad claims are misleading 
because they're based on data from federal trade commission testing 
machines. Those machines don't smoke the way people do, he says, and 
the tobacco companies have known that for years. People who are deceived, 
deceived, fooled into believing that they were going to protect their 
health by continuing to smoke but smoking lighter, toxic cigarettes, 
it's not true. Lautenberg wants the FTC to ban light and ultralight 
claims, and he has sent the agency tobacco company documents which 
he says prove his case. One, a 1975 Philip Morris study, found people 
smoking Marlboro and Marlboro lights took in nearly equal amounts 
of tar and nicotine. For example, nicotine intake for regular was 
1.5 milligrams. For light, 1.4. tar inhaled for regular cigarettes 
was 20.2 milligrams. For light cigarettes, 17.8. tobacco companies 
say Lautenberg is oversimplifying a very complicated issue, but otherwise 
refused comment. Those are laser holes, they're right there where 
the mouth goes. One expert says the tiny filter holes designed to 
introduce air into smoke from a light cigarette, thereby lowering 
tar and nicotine intake, don't work. Because, he says, smokers sensing 
the difference, compensate. You do what comes naturally, you suck 
a little harder, maybe push it in a Little bit more, and your lips 
cover the holes. And then you get a full dose. Health advocates want 
ventilation holes clearly marked so smokers don't accidentally cover 
them. And the FTC says it is considering changing its testing methods.
