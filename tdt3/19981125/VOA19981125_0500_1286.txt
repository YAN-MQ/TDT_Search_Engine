And European football officials have announced plans for a new style 
of UEFA cup competition that will likely be implemented next season. 
At a general meeting in Geneva Tuesday of all 51 national federations, 
UEFA officials recommended a new UEFA cup should be a single elimination 
tournament from start to finish. The new event is a merger of the 
existing competition with the winner's cup and will take effect at 
the same time as the revamped championship league tournament. That's 
sports. I'm Ray Kouguell.
