The U.S. administration has decided to back a new Iraqi dissident 
leader to spearhead a reinvigorated campaign to oust President Saddam 
Hussein, Iraqi exiles said Wednesday. The United States nominated 
Adnan al-Pachachi, a former foreign minister, to forge a united Iraqi 
opposition movement that would try to topple Saddam, the dissidents 
in exile said. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk proposed 
al-Pachachi's name during his meeting with 16 Iraqi opposition leaders 
in London on Tuesday, said some of the participants. Al-Pachachi, 
who also attended the meeting, said in a telephone interview from 
London: ``I think this is our last chance and we should not loose 
it.'' U.S. Embassy officials in London were not available for comment. 
But a State Department official in Washington said that while Indyk 
did meet with al-Pachachi in London he made it clear that it is up 
to the Iraqi opposition to organize themselves. The United States 
cannot annoint or appoint someone to be their leader, said the official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity.
