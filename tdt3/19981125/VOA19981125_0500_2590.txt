Meanwhile, Chilean authorities are investigating the reported kidnapping 
of two Spanish tourists said to be held by suspected supporters of 
former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Family members of the two victims 
say Gonzala de Cuoba Lopez and his daughter Anna sent them an e-mail 
saying they'd been abducted as they entered Northern Chile. Spanish 
embassy officials said the message indicated the 64-year-old economist 
and his 23-year-old daughter are being held hostage until Britain's 
highest court rules on Mr. Pinochet's fate today. Despite the message, 
Spanish and Chilean authorities say they cannot confirm or deny that 
there's been a kidnapping. Once source said they could not rule out 
a hoax.
