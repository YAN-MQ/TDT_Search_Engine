I'm Bill Hazard, VOA News. The U.N. Security Council has discussed 
the latest dispute between Iraq and U.N. weapons inspectors but reached 
no consensus on how to respond to Iraq's refusal to hand over documents 
requested by chief arms inspector Richard Butler. Instead, the Council 
expressed continued full support for the U.N. Special Commission in 
charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The United 
States, which almost launched air strikes against Iraq during an earlier 
standoff this month, says it's watching this situation closely.
