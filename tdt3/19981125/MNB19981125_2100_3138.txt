Before we go, another look at the weather across the nation for this 
Thanksgiving weekend where the hot spots and rough spots are. Thappings, 
Brian. You spoke earlier of the Macy's Thanksgiving day parade tomorrow. 
Most of the east coast cities will see rain, Boston, Washington, D.C., 
but nice across the southern states, Dallas 73, some sunshine, 68 
in L.A., 84 in Phoenix, 70 in Denver tomorrow. More rain and wind 
for the pacific northwest on Thanksgiving. As we go to the rest of 
the weekend, it's actually going to warm up across much of the country 
into the northeast back to the Great Lakes, temperatures will be warmer 
than normal, all the way down to the gulf coast. Rain developing over 
the southwest, though, showers extending up through the northern Rockies. 
Finally, the sun will break on Saturday in the pacific northwest with 
the rain coming to an end as it shifts to the east. Chilly across 
the northern tier from parts of Maine acorrect me if I'm wrong the 
Canadian border. Welcome back, Brian.
