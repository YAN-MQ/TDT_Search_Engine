Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat takes the first official flight from 
Gaza International Airport, and we are there, thanks to David Gullus 
reporting from Jerusalem. Mr. Arafat left for Paris and talks with 
French President Jacques Chirac a day after the formal opening of 
the airport, a symbol of growing Palestinian independence and an improved 
peace process with Israel. The Palestinian leader had previously had 
to be driven from Gaza to the Egyptian airfield at Al`Arish for his 
trips abroad. Israel agreed to allow the airport to open under last 
month's U.S.-brokered Wye River interim peace agreement. Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, postponed a departure for 
Europe for at least several hours for negotiations aimed at shoring 
up his right-of-center government which has been torn by disputes 
over the Wye agreement. He is expected to invite moderate former foreign 
minister David Levy back into the government. Mr. Levy had quit the 
government last January over the slow pace of peace efforts. David 
Gullus, VOA News, Jerusalem.
