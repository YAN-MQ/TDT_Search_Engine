BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Congolese President Laurent Kabila's first 
official visit to Belgium attracted a flurry of criticism Wednesday 
over his refusal to negotiate with rebels and alleged role in human 
rights violations. Kabila faced demands from the European Union that 
he negotiate with the rebels waging a four-month insurgency. ``This 
allows me to ... encourage him to change his policy and look for a 
political instead of a military solution, because there is no military 
solution for Congo,'' said Aldo Ajello, the EU's special envoy to 
central Africa. Conceicao Van Dunem, the EU's spokeswoman on African 
affairs, hinted EU aid could depend on solution to the conflict. ``There 
is no development without peace, and no peace without reconciliation,'' 
she told reporters Tuesday. Kabila has refused direct talks with the 
rebels, demanding instead that Rwanda and Uganda end their support 
for the insurgents. He rejected negotiations again Tuesday on the 
first leg of his European tour in Rome. ``There are no rebels in our 
country,'' he told Associated Press Television News. ``There are puppets 
used by the invaders of our country.'' Human rights abuses under the 
late President Mobutu Sese Seko led the EU to suspend all aid but 
emergency humanitarian supplies in 1992, when the country was known 
as Zaire. Aid has not been resumed. European officials are anxious 
to resolve the Congolese conflict fearing it could escalate into a 
wider regional war. Already the fighting has dragged in troops from 
Namibia, Zimbabwe, Chad and Angola to support Kabila while Rwanda 
and Uganda back the rebels. Kabila arrived late Tuesday for a three-day 
stay in Belgium that includes meetings with Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Dehaene, King Albert II as well as the EU officials. The visit is 
Kabila's first to Congo's former colonial ruler since he toppled Mobutu 
to take power in 1997. His trip has sparked protests from human rights 
organizations and alleged victims of rights abuse. Lawyers representing 
members of Congo's Tutsi minority and an opposition political group 
have filed law suits against Kabila in Belgian courts accusing him 
of inciting ethnic hatred against Tutsis and other violations of international 
law. But lawyers acknowledged that, as a serving head of state, Kabila 
can claim diplomatic immunity. On Monday, Amnesty International released 
a report on Congo highlighting atrocities by government and opposition 
forces. It cited widespread human rights abuses by the rebels including 
killings, torture and rape, but said Kabila's forces also massacred 
civilians suspected of sympathizing with the opposition. Fearing protests 
from opposition supporters among Belgium's 12,000-strong Congolese 
community, the Congolese embassy in Brussels has demanded enforced 
security during the visit. ``We don't want him to be thrown into danger,'' 
Charge d'Affaires Emile Kanengele told RTL-TVI television. On Thursday 
leaves Belgium for a summit of French-speaking African nations in 
Paris.
