We could go on,. There are about 36 hours and 56 minutes more tapes. 
We want to stay. Cable time is expensive. Thank you. We'll be back. 
We'll have a preview of the holiday movie season. These days, seems 
like everybody's got a Cherokee or an explorer. me? I like to stand 
out a bit. That's why I drive a Subaru outback. With a big cargo bay 
and all-wheel drive, you get all the sport-utility you need. With 
a smooth ride and better gas mileage, the outback is far from ordinary. 
Like me, really. What a weird looking bunch that was. Man, that Chili 
was hot. You got heartburn, too? Yeah. Wanna try these new pepcid 
ac chewables? It says you gotta take it with water. What's the water 
for? With tums, you don't need water. Just because new pepcid is chewable 
doesn't mean it works like tums. Tums calcium knocks out heartburn 
fast. Pepcid chewables' famotidine has to go through your bloodstream, 
so it takes 40 minutes just to start working. You wanna go back for 
water? Forget the water. Pass the tums. Tums ta tum tum tums
