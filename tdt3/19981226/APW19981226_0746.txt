Tammy Wynette died and Garth Brooks again proved his marketing acumen, 
selling 27 million albums by repackaging his old hits _ twice. That 
was country music in a nutshell in 1998, a year in which the very 
rich got richer and everybody else fought for a smaller piece of the 
pie. When the final tally is done, 1998 country music sales are expected 
to be up as much as 12 percent. But that figure is deceiving. While 
Brooks and other superstars like Shania Twain had banner years, sales 
for other acts stalled or took a dip. ``A lot of those mid-level artists 
were selling a million records a few years ago,'' said Jay Knowles, 
a staff songwriter at Sony ATV. ``But now there's four or five that 
are selling 6 million records and everybody else is selling 400,000 
or so.'' The problem is an old one. Record sales are primarily the 
result of airplay on country music radio stations, which account for 
roughly one in four of all U.S. radio stations (2,368 of 10,394), 
by far the most popular format. The people who decide what music country 
stations play are getting more conservative as the radio industry 
consolidates. ``Some of these radio people don't know if they're going 
to have a job next week, so it's not likely they'll take too many 
chances,'' Brooks said. ``I think it would help things a lot if those 
guys started feeling more secure in their jobs.'' The radio industry 
is still chaotic because of the federal Telecommunications Act of 
1996, which freed companies to acquire stations in the same city. 
The new law led to an avalanche of sales, with more than 4,000 stations 
changing hands. The result is a fewer number of programmers deciding 
what music to play and working under increased pressure to produce 
maximum profits because of the debt their bosses took on to acquire 
more stations. When radio programmers feel insecure, it's not a good 
time for new artists to try to break through. It's easier to rely 
on established stars like Brooks, Twain, Reba McEntire, Brooks and 
Dunn, Vince Gill, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Tim McGraw and Faith 
Hill. Only the Dixie Chicks sang their way into the top ranks of country 
music in 1998. Family act The Wilkinsons were the only new act to 
score a No. 1 record all year (``26 Cents''). ``Country is due a new 
superstar,'' veteran broadcaster Ralph Emery said. ``I think the business 
needs a new guy to come along like when Elvis came along. You know 
_ he's different, he's unique. ``With the cookie-cutter approach (country 
music executives are) using now, I don't know whether we're going 
to find him right away.'' There's no shortage of charismatic artists 
out there, but record companies generally resist anything they consider 
less than a sure bet so they either ignore them or don't promote them 
much. Nashville-based Lucinda Williams put out the superb ``Car Wheels 
on a Gravel Road,'' which wasn't even marketed as a country record 
by Mercury Records. Instead, it was a hit in the far less lucrative 
Americana format, which concentrates on roots rock. Bluegrass-leaning 
releases from Sam Bush and Jerry Douglas contained exciting music. 
And Robbie Fulks and Dale Watson are just the tip of an ``alternative 
country'' genre popular enough to support its own magazine _ No Depression 
_ and record label _ Bloodshot, out of Chicago. Oddly, very little 
of this talent seems to be taken seriously by the executives at Nashville 
record companies. Instead of supporting rawer, independent-minded 
artists who fit snugly into the country music tradition, executives 
develop young talents who are willing to be molded. They also love 
to get singers like LeAnn Rimes and Trisha Yearwood to compete with 
Whitney Houston and Celine Dion with bombastic power ballads like 
``How Do I Live.'' The mainstream industry does deserve credit for 
taking a bit of a chance and releasing records by artists like The 
Lynns (Loretta Lynn's twin daughters), Randy Scruggs and Allison Moorer 
in 1998. The best news in '98 was that the superstars could have coasted, 
but didn't. Brooks' ``Sevens,'' released late in 1997, sold 6 million 
copies during 1998 and was a return to form. Gill and Jackson, who 
went through a divorce and separation, respectively, released brave 
new albums that mined those setbacks for moving new songs. Hill earned 
a pop smash with the irresistible single ``This Kiss.'' Deana Carter 
showed that the success of her debut was no fluke, following ``Did 
I Shave My Legs for This?'' with an even better ``Everything's Gonna 
Be Alright.'' Twain crossed over to pop with ``Come on Over,'' and 
embarked on a high-profile tour. National interest in country music 
remained strong, as evidenced by CNN's decision to broadcast Wynette's 
memorial service live from Nashville's famed Ryman Auditorium. Brooks 
drew fans to Wal-Marts across the country to see a closed-circuit 
television concert that launched ``Garth Brooks Double Live.'' Many 
fans did as Brooks hoped and bought the album on the way out, helping 
him sell more than 1 million copies the first week, breaking debut- 
and one-week sales records set by Pearl Jam and ``The Bodyguard'' 
soundtrack, respectively. Earlier in the year, Brooks released a box 
set of his first six albums, and sold 2 million. ``In Nashville, we 
have two businesses,'' Emery said. ``We have the Garth business and 
the country music business. Garth is a phenomenon like we could not 
have imagined in the '60s and '70s _ and part of the '80s. I think 
the marketing that has been done with him has been unbelievable.'' 
In 1999, other country artists would do well to think of ways to emulate 
Brooks' self-promotion. The Judds already have done so, announcing 
a reunion concert on Dec. 31, 1999, in Phoenix, Arizona. Expect more 
surprises from the media-savvy mother-daughter duo as 1999 wears on.
