Two weeks ago, Tim Couch came in fourth in the Heisman Trophy balloting. 
But that was then, and this is now. And right now, the University 
of Kentucky quarterback is trying to position himself as the No. 1 
selection in the 1999 National Football League draft, the player whom 
the restored Cleveland Browns _ who pick first _ will build themselves 
around. ``If I can't be the No. 1 pick,'' said Couch, a 21-year-old 
junior preparing to take on Penn State in the Outback Bowl on Jan. 
1, ``then I won't come out. I'll stay in school. I'd like to play 
in Cleveland. It's close to home, and my friends and family can see 
me play. Cleveland can't guarantee me anything before the draft, but 
they have told me I'm a top candidate. It's a lot like picking colleges.'' 
In effect, deciding what to do about the draft is the second big decision 
Couch has had to make in recent years. His first came when he chose 
to stay home and play college football when he could have gone just 
about anywhere. In fact, when the 6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound Couch, 
a classic drop-back passer, came out of Leslie County High School 
in Hyden, Ky., he had broken every state high school football record 
ever recorded. He was the Gatorade high school player of the year, 
and became everybody's all-American. Heavily recruited, especially 
by Tennessee, Couch, a self-described ``mountain boy,'' ended up choosing 
Kentucky. The home fans have never forgotten. ``There are people around 
here who say he's bigger than Elvis,'' said Couch's father, Elbert, 
who will retire this year after 27 years as the director of transportation 
for the Leslie County Board of Education in Hyden, a mountain town 
on the Cumberland Plateau with a population of 450. ``A friend of 
mine rides around with me in my pickup truck,'' Elbert Couch said, 
``and we look at each other and say, `Can you believe this happened 
to a boy from Hyden?' The No. 1 draft pick, that's all we want for 
Tim. It would be nice, real nice. I've never had $1 million. That's 
a lot of money for Tim. We'll make a decision as a family on Jan. 
4.'' Couch must decide to declare or stay in school on Jan. 8. Initially, 
he directed Kentucky to request special dispensation to prolong his 
decision. Because of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, 
the request was turned down. Unlike in college basketball, once Couch 
decides to come out, he can't return to college football. If Couch 
chooses to come out, he has the blessing of Kentucky's head coach, 
Hal Mumme. ``Coach Mumme has told me without question, I am ready 
physically and mentally,'' Couch said. ``He told me it's where my 
heart is, what will make me happy.'' Mumme was hired after Couch's 
freshman year at Kentucky, about the time Couch threatened to transfer 
to Tennessee after a dismal season under Bill Curry. Since then, Mumme 
has enjoyed success with his star quarterback. ``More than anything,'' 
Mumme said, ``Tim has a great passion for the game. Tim just loves 
football. If there were not such a thing as college football, he'd 
be the guy calling everybody after class to go play on the intramural 
field. He was even happy to hear that we'll be practicing on Christmas 
Day. ``Selfishly, I'd like Tim to stay for the people of Kentucky 
and for the benefit of the team next year. It would be a lot easier 
to coach him than a new quarterback.'' By the end of this past season, 
Couch had broken seven Southeastern Conference records, including 
total offensive yards (4,151), pass completions (400), completion 
percentage (72.3) and passing yards (4,275) while leading Kentucky 
to a 7-4 record and its first bowl appearance since 1993. For his 
college career, Couch has had 1,184 pass attempts, 795 completions, 
8,435 passing yards, 74 touchdown passes, and a 67.1 completion percentage. 
He holds four NCAA records, 14 SEC records and 26 school records. 
Whenever Couch turns professional, his brother, Greg, 25, plans to 
manage his NFL career. Greg Couch was a backup quarterback for Edmonton 
in the Canadian Football League for part of this season, before returning 
to Eastern Kentucky University to graduate last week. ``I'll watch 
out for things during the transition from college to the NFL,'' Greg 
Couch said. ``It's a tremendous jump, and he needs to focus on things 
as a player. We're biased, but so are a lot of other people. Tim is 
a No. 1 pick.'' Is Couch really ready for the NFL? ``Yes,'' the quarterback 
said. ``I've always had high goals regarding playing at the next level. 
If it's there, I will work hard. The biggest difference will be learning 
new offenses. I like Denver's offense, and Green Bay's and Minnesota's. 
``The biggest thing that's happened for me this year is reading defenses. 
You gain that with age. I think I see so many more coverages now, 
the blitzes, how the coverages change, the protection at the line 
of scrimmage. It's all a mental part of the game, and I think I've 
really grown.'' Even rival agents agree. ``Whether this year or next 
year,'' said Leigh Steinberg, agent to 27 NFL quarterbacks, ``Tim 
Couch will be the first pick in the NFL draft. He projects as a franchise 
quarterback. He's someone a team can be built around. A team can win 
because of him rather than with him. The market for NFL stars is expanding 
exponentially right now. Steve Young is the highest paid at a package 
of over $7.5 million a year. Later this year, we may have a $10 million 
quarterback and at the end of the TV contract, a $15 million quarterback. 
This market is ready to break loose.'' Carmen Policy, the president 
of the Cleveland Browns, said in an interview last Tuesday that he 
was unable to directly comment on Couch because Couch was still an 
underclassman. But a source close to Policy said that he was trying 
to hire an offensive-minded head coach who would be able to handle 
a young quarterback. ``I have a deep and abiding interest in the selection 
of a head coach and quarterback who will serve as building blocks 
for this organization going into the next decade,'' Policy said. And 
while no one in the Couch family is admitting that he is making himself 
available for the next NFL draft, there are already hints that the 
timing is right. ``He's a humble, good-looking boy,'' said Janice 
Couch, Tim's mother. ``I think he's ready.'' ``I know he's ready,'' 
said Elbert Couch, who put a football in his son's crib when he was 
born. ``He's going to lose most of his offensive line to graduation. 
He has a strong head for a 21-year-old. I don't think he's done anybody 
wrong. Cleveland can build their first-round pick around a quarterback 
or Ricky Williams. If I went out, I would want to be the No.player, 
but we know there are no guarantees.'' Couch learned that particular 
lesson quite painfully last month when his childhood friend, 21-year-old 
Scott Brock, and a Kentucky defensive tackle, Artie Steinmetz, were 
killed and Kentucky's starting center, Jason Watts, was injured in 
a car crash. The pickup truck driven by Watts flipped over as the 
three were on their way to a deer-hunting trip _ an outing that Couch 
had turned down. Watts has since been charged with manslaughter. The 
accident was especially crushing for Couch. Brock had caught Couch's 
passes from nursery school through high school and it was Brock, Couch 
says, and all of his boyhood friends in Hyden, who ``defined me as 
who I am.'' ``He was a mountain boy,'' Couch said. ``Just like me.'' 
Against Penn State in the Outback Bowl, Couch and his teammates will 
wear a patch on their uniforms in honor of three friends who should 
have been there. The game will be played in Tampa, Fla., and already 
Kentucky fans have scooped up 27,000 tickets, perhaps figuring this 
will be the last time they will see Couch play for the school. They 
could be right. And they could be in for a memorable goodbye.
