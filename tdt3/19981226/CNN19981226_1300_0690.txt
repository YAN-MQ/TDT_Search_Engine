Coming up later, Robin Williams goes to medical school to try to locate 
the funny bone of movie audiences. But first, a check of the top stories, 
then a business update in "Dollars & Sense. Whoa! Remember this place 
and those midnight snacks? Hi, guys. Mindy! Let's have 2 dogs with 
the works. Hey, I can't have one of those now. Watching your figure? 
No, I didn't take my pepcid ac and it's too late now. Take my tagamet-- 
you can eat now. Tagamet introduces a better way to avoid heartburn. 
Not before, not after--now! Now you can take tagamet right when you're 
gonna eat and still prevent heartburn. Mindy? You two... back again? 
Mindy! With tagamet, you can eat like a kid again.
