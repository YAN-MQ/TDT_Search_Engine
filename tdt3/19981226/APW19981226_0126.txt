Yemenis can now avoid the country's compulsory two-year military service 
by paying a fee equal to dlrs 20. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh 
on Friday approved a bill allowing men who do not wish to be drafted 
to pay 15 percent of a conscript's monthly salary of 700 riyals (dlrs 
5.6) for the two years, the official Al-Thawra newspaper reported 
Saturday. That amounts to a total of 2,520 riyals, or dlrs 20. Economic 
analysts said the reason for the new law was to reduce government 
expenses in line with economic reforms required by the International 
Monetary Fund. The government provides housing and clothing and pays 
a transportation allowance as well as a monthly stipend to its conscripts. 
No figures were available on the total amount of money spent on conscripts. 
Military service is compulsory in Yemen for men over 18. Yemen has 
a foreign debt of some dlrs 10 billion. Most of its 17 million people 
live in poverty.
