Two of the last three longtime aides of the late Khmer Rouge leader, 
Pol Pot, have emerged from their jungle hideouts in the hope of becoming 
``ordinary citizens,'' the government announced Saturday. It released 
copies of handwritten letters by the two men _ Khieu Samphan and Nuon 
Chea _ pledging allegiance to the government as well as a reply from 
Prime Minister Hun Sen welcoming them in from the cold. The defections 
are the latest, and among the most important, in a longtime Communist 
insurgency that began collapsing more than two years ago. They leave 
just one widely hated man, Ta Mok, at large from among the inner circle 
of Pol Pot, who died in April. Both of the men are among the targets 
of a potential international tribunal for crimes against humanity 
committed from 1975 to 1979, when the Khmer Rouge caused the deaths 
of more than a million people. But despite their defections, the two 
men are not yet in government hands and the possibility of bringing 
them to trial remains in question. Like previous defectors from among 
the leadership, officials said, both men have relocated to the remote 
gem-mining town of Pailin, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold. Though 
Pailin is now formally under government control, it is guarded by 
2,000 armed former guerrillas and is on a border with Thailand, which 
has been a safe haven for Khmer Rouge leaders for years. The clear 
hope of the two elderly men is that they will be left alone, as previous 
defectors have been, and that Cambodia will choose not to stir up 
past demons with a trial. ``My only request is to return to society 
and live as an ordinary citizen,'' said Nuon Chea, 71, who was sometimes 
counted as ``Brother Number 2'' under Pol Pot. He is believed by investigators 
to have been responsible for horrific purges that resulted in the 
proliferation of Cambodia's ``killing fields.'' His words were echoed, 
in almost identical language, by Khieu Samphan, 67, who was the official 
head of state and the friendly, reasonable face of Pol Pot's brutal 
regime. His doctoral thesis, written in France in the 1950s, is sometimes 
seen as the blueprint for the movement's evacuation of cities and 
destruction of culture, learning, religion and industry. Under the 
rubric of ``national reconciliation,'' Cambodia has so far preferred 
to try to forget, if not to forgive, the traumas of its past. But 
even if forgotten, they continue to infect the present. It was in 
part because of his negotiations with Khieu Samphan that Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh was ousted in a coup last year by Hun Sen. But following 
an election, Ranariddh is back, sharing a coalition government as 
speaker of the National Assembly, and it is Hun Sen who negotiated 
with Khieu Samphan. Though many Cambodians, weary and brutalized by 
years of war and mass killings, say they prefer to let bygones be 
bygones, others say they fear the lesson that may be sent if Khmer 
Rouge leaders walk free. ``We cannot forget the past like this,'' 
said Thun Saray, leader of a human rights advocacy group called Adhoc. 
``If we do not send these people to a tribunal, future leaders might 
say, `Oh, I'm only applying some new ideas for the good of the people; 
I'm only killing 100,000 more people; why punish me, because I am 
only acting in the interests of the Cambodian people.''' If Hun Sen 
chooses to cooperate with preparations by the United Nations for a 
tribunal that would be held in Cambodia, both of the defectors could 
be extricated from Pailin, said Stephen Heder, a London-based expert 
on the Khmer Rouge. ``Where there's a will, there's a way,'' Heder 
said. He said a cut in Pailin's economic lifeline by the Cambodian 
government on one side and the Thais on the other could persuade the 
younger leaders, who now control the isolated enclave, to cut loose 
these old revolutionary war horses. On the other hand, Hun Sen might 
find it in his political interests to let the defectors live out their 
old age as the ``ordinary citizens'' they dream of being. But if Ta 
Mok is caught, the international outcry against this lone remaining 
fugitive would be difficult to silence, Heder said. A hot-tempered, 
one-legged peasant soldier who is believed to be in his 70s, he has 
such a reputation for brutality that even among the Khmer Rouge he 
is known as ``the butcher.'' His status and whereabouts are unknown, 
but Heder said he could imagine Ta Mok's state of mind as the last 
of the Khmer Rouge leaders on the run. ``I presume he is sitting up 
there very lonely, with nobody to talk to,'' he said.
