Holding candles and laying flowers in the street, about 200 students 
held a Muslim prayer session Saturday to commemorate the deaths of 
student protesters in clashes last month with security forces. It 
was the first student rally since the beginning a week ago of the 
Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The activists ignored a pledge by some 
student organizers to refrain from demonstrating during Ramadan to 
avoid offending worshippers in predominately Muslim Indonesia. The 
mourners filed briefly into Jakarta's main thoroughfare after holding 
a night prayer in the parking lot of Atma Jaya Catholic University. 
The area was the scene of fighting on Nov. 13 between anti-riot officers 
and students that left nine people dead and triggered rioting in several 
parts of Jakarta. The students had been demonstrating against a government 
assembly on political reforms, which they rejected because many of 
its members were appointed by former President Suharto. The authoritarian 
leader was ousted in May after 32 years in power. Suharto's successor, 
President B.J. Habibie, has implemented some reforms and has scheduled 
parliamentary elections in June. But he has not yielded to student 
demands to put Suharto on trial and strip the military of its powerful 
political role. ``We hope that the dead students are accepted by God 
and we gather here in the hopes of avoiding more victims in the future,'' 
a student said in a speech at the university. Other students knelt 
on prayer mats and intoned, ``God is great.''
