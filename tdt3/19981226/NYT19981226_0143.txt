So many stores. So little time. ``I know there are many Christmas 
sales, so I have very much to do today,'' said Yoshihito Higashi, 
a Japanese student visiting New York City for the holidays. He was 
breathless with excitement. His shopping bag, stuffed with Salvatore 
Ferragamo shoes, jiggled in his hands. He scanned Madison Avenue and, 
like a sprinter before a race, began to bounce up and down as he spotted 
the door to the Crate &AMP; Barrel store. ``Many stores still,'' Higashi 
explained in apology for rushing off. ``Here. Fifth Avenue. Then I 
am going to SoHo.'' On what has traditionally been one of the busiest 
shopping days of the year, the streets of mid-Manhattan and suburban 
shopping malls filled up only slowly Saturday with bargain hunters 
and people bearing gifts to exchange or return. ``This Christmas is 
very different than the last two,'' said Wendy Braunstein, manager 
of the Me Too shoe store in the Roosevelt Field mall in Garden City, 
as she waited for a rush of customers. ``I think it's retail in general. 
People are not spending as much.'' But hopes were high. At the Westchester, 
a mall in White Plains, parking lots were about three-quarters full 
by early afternoon. ``The big thing today is turning around the returns 
into positive sales _ making the return an exchange,'' said Bruce 
Embree, the manager of Nordstrom's. He said sales appeared to be running 
about the same as on the day after Thanksgiving, another traditionally 
heavy shopping day. The day after Christmas brings a flood of sales 
at many stores, but many shoppers said they had become numb to the 
pitches because so many sales are offered throughout the year. What 
appeared to draw some people to the shops was the chance, on a weekend 
day, to return and exchange holiday gifts. Lisa Kapp, sales manager 
for North and South America for Fogal, said she was making a few quick 
late-morning stops at Barneys and other midtown stores to exchange 
Christmas presents. But she has been conservative in her shopping 
this year, heeding the sales offers that seem to come every month, 
and said she bought ``better but fewer'' items overall. The last thing 
Ms. Kapp said she had in mind was a round of shopping. Her plan was 
to see a movie or two. ``We want to stay away from the stores,'' she 
said. ``Who wants to go shopping after Christmas?'' The answer was: 
lots of people. ``We've shopped for everyone else and now it's time 
to shop for ourselves,'' said Darlene Mooney, who drove from her home 
in Brooklyn with a friend to hunt for bargains at Roosevelt Field. 
Discounts were on their minds. ``I don't shop at retail prices anymore,'' 
said Ms. Mooney. ``Anyone who does is crazy.'' In Manhattan, business 
also seemed sluggish at many luxury stores. ``It wasn't crowded, really,'' 
said Jonathan Ephraim, a shopper who took a spin through Barneys, 
which was promoting a storewide postholiday sale. ``I was at Bloomingdale's 
at 9:15 this morning and it was empty, although it had pretty much 
filled up by 10 or so.'' Crowds or no crowds, making the rounds of 
midtown stores the day after Christmas is a tradition that many people 
said they anticipated with joy and executed with relish. ``No store 
is safe,'' said Charles Kilby, interrupted for a brief midshop conversation 
during his rounds of midtown stores. He had already hit Tiffany's 
(in a vain search for his yearly discounted Christmas card haul), 
Crate and Barrel and Barneys. He was on his way to Bergdorf's and 
the Metropolitan Museum store. ``Then we're going to regroup,'' said 
Kilby, who works for Lycos in Boston and was visiting his parents 
in Connecticut. His friend Christine Amirian, a brand manager for 
Kraft Foods in New York, was trying bravely to keep up. The two shared 
the shopping bags. ``I'm not quite as avid a shopper as Charles is,'' 
she said. ``But I was easily convinced to come and see what kind of 
carnage I can do.'' For other shoppers, hitting the day-after-Christmas 
sales is a sort of stately and inexplicable ritual. Richard Gourley 
Jr., a Manhattan bank executive, said he had been coming to the post-Christmas 
sale at Brooks Bros. since he was in prep school. He is now 51 years 
old. ``Today I bought two suits, a pair of shoes, two shirts, and 
I replaced a tie my mother gave me that I didn't like,'' he said as 
he emerged, three navy blue Brooks Bros. bags in hand, from the store 
on Madison Avenue. ``I spent far less than the regular prices.'' But 
it isn't only the sale that draws him. It is tradition. ``Everyone 
I went to school with _ the day after Christmas, you go to Brooks 
Bros.,'' Gourley said. ``This,'' he added, ``is where you come to 
get your button-down shirts.'' That kind of loyalty has generally 
made Dec. 26 the biggest day of the year for the store, with about 
30 percent to 40 percent higher sales than the busy days before Christmas, 
Jack Delargy, senior vice president and general manager of Brooks 
Bros. And it could be even better, he added, because the big day fell 
on a Saturday. ``It should bring in a lot more people from the suburbs 
because it's a natural day off for everybody,'' said Delargy, who 
called in the entire store staff to work Saturday. For stores selling 
merchandise other than clothes, the day after Christmas was less important. 
``The two weeks before Christmas are our busiest time,'' said Lisa 
Smith, the manager of the Crate and Barrel store at 59th Street and 
Madison Avenue. Sales were offered on holiday-related merchandise 
_ ``everything that screams Christmas,'' Ms. Smith said _ but there 
was no blanket storewide sale like those that many fashion retailers 
offer after Christmas. Nor did she expect exceptionally big crowds 
of shoppers, especially since it was a Saturday. ``New Yorkers,'' 
Ms. Smith said, ``leave town.''
