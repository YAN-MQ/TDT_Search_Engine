A federal judge has ordered a new election for the leadership of one 
of New York City's largest postal unions after finding that the incumbents 
acted illegally in keeping their opponents off the ballot. In a ruling 
issued earlier this month, Judge Constance Baker Motley of U.S. District 
Court in Manhattan found that the leadership of the New York Metro 
Area Postal Union, which represents 14,000 workers in mail-sorting 
sites, violated federal labor law. Judge Motley wrote in her opinion 
that the union's leaders were wrong to disqualify seven opposition 
candidates for failing to provide their addresses and Social Security 
numbers at a nominating meeting. The union disqualified one of the 
opposition candidates even though he filed his address and Social 
Security number the day after the nominating meeting. The disqualifications 
enabled the union's leaders to run unopposed in the March 1997 election, 
the third time in 10 years that the union held uncontested elections. 
The judge said the union's leaders had acted illegally because they 
did little to inform their opponents about the need to provide the 
information at the nominating meeting. ``A union cannot enforce as 
a rule, on penalty of disqualification, a requirement that it has 
not adequately disclosed,'' Judge Motley wrote. She specifically criticized 
the union's leaders for not mentioning at its meetings what information 
nominees needed to provide. After having their protests rejected by 
the union, the disqualified candidates appealed to the secretary of 
labor, Alexis Herman, who then sued on their behalf. The challengers 
who were thrown off the ballot asserted that this was a case in which 
the leadership deliberately twisted the rules in order to squelch 
democracy. Willie Smith, the opposition candidate for president who 
was thrown off the ballot, said the judge's ruling was a good decision. 
``They planned the whole thing,'' he said of the incumbents. ``They 
planned to disqualify us all along.'' The union had argued that it 
needed the challengers' addresses and Social Security numbers by the 
time the nominating meeting ended to make sure the nominees were properly 
identified and were legitimate members of the union. In addition, 
the incumbents said the information was needed to identify a nominee 
whose name was identical to that of another member, as was the case 
with Smith. Anthony Caniano, an executive vice president of the union, 
maintained that all union members had a copy of the union's constitution 
``and should have known what the requirements were.'' But Judge Motley 
found that the constitution was ambiguous about the deadline for providing 
addresses and Social Security numbers. She said the constitution was 
not clear that the information had to be provided at the nominating 
meeting. She ruled that the union's ``officials provided highly uneven 
notice: personal assistance with requirements for incumbents' slate 
members but mere availability of muddy texts for the rank and file.'' 
Caniano said the union's leaders did not plan to appeal the ruling. 
``We don't agree with it,'' he said, ``but we'll abide by the law.''
