Stephanie Lehmann still cringes when she remembers the broker who 
showed her 60 apartments _ because, in the end, she bought a place 
through someone else. She imagines that the broker, frustrated and 
angry, left the business for good because of her. Real estate and 
everything that goes with it _ the close relationship between buyer 
and broker, the search for space that somehow embodies the self, or 
at least hopes for the self _ consumed Ms. Lehmann for more than a 
year. During that time, she turned the obsession into a play, ``River 
Views,'' which just finished a three-month run at the 13th Street 
Repertory Company in Greenwich Village. The play _ not a tragedy, 
but a romantic farce _ tells the story of an actress who dreams of 
a place with a river view, while her husband, a stockbroker, surprises 
her by buying a house in the suburbs. Because the play is a farce, 
the broker is not a portrait of the one who still haunts her, but 
a representation of the aggressive, overbearing type, one willing 
to say anything to get someone to see an apartment. ``I did meet some 
of them, but they were the exception,'' Ms. Lehmann said. In general, 
she added, ``I liked them.'' For Ms. Lehmann, who is 36 and the author 
of five full-length plays that have been produced in various small 
theaters, writing about real estate allowed her to capture a certain 
point in the life of a marriage. ``It's about where you will live, 
and the compromises, and who gets what they want, and who doesn't,'' 
she said. While the play was inspired by her apartment hunting, it 
does not portray it, although there are some parallels to her experience. 
Her husband, Steve Kronovet, is a stockbroker, and he did have some 
thoughts about moving to the suburbs. But in the end, she said, she 
got her way and three and a half years ago, after a year-long search, 
they bought a three-bedroom apartment on Riverside Drive. Basically, 
she said, the suburbs were not really an option. ``He hates looking 
at real estate,'' she said, ``so he didn't have a fighting chance.'' 
Raised in a house in San Francisco, by a Freudian analyst father and 
an artist mother, with an expansive view of the bay and the Golden 
Gate Bridge, she couldn't see herself in the suburbs. ``I couldn't 
imagine the isolation,'' she said. ``Where do you go for coffee? If 
I had to go to Dunkin' Donuts . . .'' She doesn't finish the sentence. 
She doesn't need to. To be a playwright, she felt she had to stay 
in New York. But she also wanted more space than she had. Although 
they were renting a two bedroom apartment with views in Midtown, she 
wanted each of her children, Madeline, now 10, and David, now 5, to 
have a bedroom and she was tired of the neighborhood. Although she 
knew the Upper West Side offered big apartments suitable for families, 
she was drawn to the idea of living downtown, where she had started 
in New York. After graduating with a major in psychology from the 
University of California at Berkeley, and trying out cooking school, 
she had come to the city as a graduate student in English at New York 
University. It was there that she met her husband, who was an aspiring 
playwright. As if living out the script handed to an aspiring writer, 
she was living on East Sixth Street in a cockroach-infested garret 
_ an actual garret, she says, on the top story, with sloping floors. 
Living in Manhattan Plaza and looking for a new place to live, she 
went to many open houses, seeing about 150 apartments by the time 
she was done. The Village was appealing, she says, because ``it matched 
my image of myself as a writer and an artist.'' The Upper West Side 
struck her as very bourgeois and middle class, but on the other hand, 
it has a lot of buildings with the views that she craves. ``I had 
to get over the idea of its being really dull, and that we were going 
to be entering our boring middle age,'' she said. Downtown, Ms. Lehmann 
said, with its fashionable restaurants, is the image of young, ``like 
your life is still ahead of you, and anything can happen.'' But ignoring 
her image of the Upper West Side, she forged ahead, and looked at 
the large classic apartments on and near Riverside Drive. With every 
one, there was always something wrong. The maid's room was too small 
to be a third bedroom, or the apartment was on the ground floor and 
dark, or the maintenance was too high. But then a broker showed her 
a real three-bedroom apartment on Riverside Drive, with a huge kitchen 
and three bathrooms on the fourth floor for $510,000. (That's not 
a misprint; her search was conducted four years ago.) It doesn't have 
the river view that she wanted, but she had had to give up on that 
early into the search, because they just couldn't afford it. Still, 
she said, ``if you go right up to the window, you can see the sky.'' 
In fact, when she walked in and saw the apartment, she knew her search 
was over. ``I actually felt a little disappointed,'' she recalled, 
``because I knew this was going to be the one.'' And that meant no 
more looking at apartments. ``I love looking at people's places,'' 
she said. ``I think you really get a glimpse of people's lives, and 
the truth of what's out there.'' The knowledge has not left her, even 
though she is now part of the bourgeois family masses of her neighborhood, 
with her children happily enrolled in local public schools. So when 
she walks by the many buildings that she looked at, ``I remember all 
the apartments I saw, and think of what it would have been like living 
there.'' Would she move again if she got a river view? ``My husband 
says he will not move,'' she said. He would have been content to stay, 
in truth, at Manhattan Plaza. ``He doesn't get involved in the whole 
fantasy of where you live,'' said Ms. Lehmann. ``For him, it's just 
something practical.'' When she would take him along to see places, 
they would have totally different reactions. ``He'd say, `Let's buy 
it,''' she recalled. ``I'd say, `Shouldn't we see the next one?' I 
had to know all the choices.'' But now, she said, the choice is made. 
A bit grimly, and not really convincingly about an event that could 
easily be 60 years in the future, she said, ``I'll probably die here. 
They'll carry me out.''
