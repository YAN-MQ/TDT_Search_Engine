In a move that sets the long-awaited constitutional reform process 
in motion, President Daniel arap Moi has signed a bill that opens 
the way for the naming of a 25-member review commission, news reports 
said Saturday. On Christmas Eve, Moi signed the Constitution of Kenya 
Review Commission Act which was passed by parliament Dec. 8, according 
to a statement issued by Attorney-General Amos Wako. Following his 
re-election last December to a final five-year term, the 74-year-old 
Moi reluctantly agreed to a review and major overhaul of the original 
1963 constitution that began with a series of meetings early this 
year among political parties and members of civil society. The talks 
nearly collapsed over the issue of who should sit on the review commission. 
Under the bill, which becomes law as soon as it is published next 
week in the Kenya Gazette, political parties will name 13 members, 
the Women's Political Caucus will name five, the rest of civil society 
will name four, including at least one disabled person, and the Roman 
Catholic, Protestant and Muslims communities will each name one. At 
least eight of the 25 seats must be filled by women. Kenya's two major 
independent national newspapers hailed the approval of the bill but 
expressed concern about the actual process of writing a new constitution. 
``It will be imprudent if, in applauding the success of forcing the 
formerly recalcitrant government to cut a deal on the review, Kenyans 
lose sight of the fact that the ultimate prize really is the construction 
of a constitution which addresses the fears and concerns that brought 
about the crisis of governance the country is laboring under, and 
guarantee that the laws will not be abused in future by the ruling 
elite and violated to serve narrow interests,'' the Daily Nation wrote 
Saturday. The review will be carried out nationwide through a three-tiered 
system by the commission, the National Consultative Forum and the 
District Consultative Forum. If all goes according to schedule, the 
new constitution should be approved by 2001 in time for the next general 
elections a year later. ``It is expected that immediately the exercise 
kicks off, the commissioners will have their hands full,'' wrote the 
East African Standard. ``We hope that there will be no attempt from 
any quarter to sneak in amendments that will only serve to marginalize 
sections of the citizenry who already have doubts about the prospects 
of fairness and justness under the process.'' Kenya is also scheduled 
to conduct a census next Aug. 24-25. The last census in 1989 was widely 
criticized for inadequately representing the real strength of the 
40-odd tribal or ethnic groups that make up the country's estimated 
population of 29 million. The present constitution has been amended 
several times, the last time in 1991 to permit the return of a multi-party 
political system.
