A playoff spot is certainly what the Arizona Cardinals are looking 
for to close out their Christmas wish list. All they have to do is 
win their final regular season game over San Diego, or if Tampa bay 
and the giants lose. People are very excited about the Cardinals and 
-- it gives you a good feeling to see some hard work pay off and to 
see people appreciate the work that you put in. As a team, we're enjoying 
certain aspects of it, but it still boils down to us taking care of 
business this weekend.
