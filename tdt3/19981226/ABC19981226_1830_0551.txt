Iraq today warned it will fire on U.S. and British planes patrolling 
no-fly zones. The zones from which Iraqi aircraft are prohibited. 
The warning came after hours after Iraq says an anti-aircraft position 
did open fire, fending off an attack from quote, enemy planes. The 
U.S. and Britain say the planes were not theirs. The U.S. says it 
will continue patrolling the no-fly zones and that pilots may respond 
if they are threatened.
