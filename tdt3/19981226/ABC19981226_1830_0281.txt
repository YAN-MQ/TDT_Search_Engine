American retailers were not very happy with sales this holiday season, 
but store owners are not despairing yet. That's because crowded stores 
this weekend are proving once again that christmas shopping doesn't 
end with Christmas. And that's good thing for the American economy. 
ABS as's Marc Mullen has been checking on the after Christmas buying 
binge. Whether it was in Chicago -- I have very good deals, everything's 
half price. In Los Angeles or in New York shoppers across the nation 
today were searching for the same thing. Bargains. Catherine and Vincent 
glauda arrived early at a New York state mall. Like many others, they 
were there -- Do you want to get one of these? -- not so much to exchange 
presents, but to buy new things. Part of a national trend. Every year, 
it gets stronger and stronger. In fact, the week after Christmas now 
does more business than the weekend after Thanksgiving and accounts 
for 11% of all holiday shopping. The prices are good before Christmas, 
but they have better sales today. Some items are 50% off or more because, 
before Christmas, consumers didn't buy as much as retailers hoped. 
Many of the deals are on winter clothes which didn't sell well because 
cold weather was late in arriving. Even with the discounts, it's projected 
that holiday sales will be up a Modest 5% this year. It is in the 
best interest of the retailer to put a carrot out there, make them 
come into the store. 20 to 50% off storewide. To get you into stores, 
many merchants rely on big promotion and ad campaigns. It's the thrill 
of the Hunt at Kmart. But to get you to actually buy something, many 
merchants have to offer sale prices on their best products. Suits 
for her, 60 to 55% off. Gone are the days when post-Christmas sales 
were used just to unload stuff that earlier customers passed up. You 
have people home from school, from college. You have an opportunity 
for families to come together. There's gift certificates. There's 
Christmas cash. Retailers are happy that the two days following Christmas 
fall on this weekend, which will give customers more time to shop. 
We don't need any of the big towels, right? So we'll get these. Of 
course, for there to be sales, customers like Catherine and vincent 
glauda must be pleased. And today, they were. Catherine, anyway. So 
where do you want to go next? Home? We can't go home, there's ten 
more hours of shopping left in the day. Mark Mullen, ABC News, New 
York.
