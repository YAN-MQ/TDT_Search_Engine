In a rare television interview, President Boris Yeltsin vowed Saturday 
to fight extremism and protect freedom of the press against attempts 
to restore censorship and other restrictions. In the interview with 
ORT public television, Yeltsin reviewed the struggles and successes 
of the past year. He said that Russia had suffered through tough times 
because of the world financial crisis, but ``the fact that we preserved 
political stability, that's the main thing.'' Recently, Yeltsin's 
television appearances have been limited mostly to formal appearances 
and clips of his meetings with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and 
other officials. On occasion, he has looked fatigued and disoriented. 
This time, viewers had a chance to see him handle questions, and he 
was in good form. Yeltsin sat in a straight chair, his black loafers 
planted firmly on the floor. He alternately scowled and smiled playfully 
at his interviewer, as if to signal that he would not let any question 
catch him up, and he spoke in a strong, steady voice. He said the 
2000 presidential campaign had begun ``a little early,'' and said 
candidates would regret that because voters would start scrutinizing 
them carefully for shortcomings. He said he saw no reason for early 
presidential elections _ making no mention of his poor health, which 
his opponents say has prevented him from carrying out his presidential 
duties _ and refused to reveal when he would endorse a successor. 
Yeltsin said he was preparing an ``offensive'' on extremism, and said 
the first step would be passage of new legislation. With new laws, 
the state could act more harshly against extremists, he said. He said 
he would not allow attacks against the media. ``We will be defending, 
we will use all our strength to defend freedom of the press, freedom 
of speech and freedom of the mass media,'' Yeltsin said. ``I promise 
you this as president and as guarantor of the Constitution.'' Yeltsin's 
promise come amid calls by Communists and other hardliners in the 
parliament to reintroduce censorship and put television under control 
of government supervisory committees. Last month, Communist Party 
leader Gennady Zyuganov and his allies sent a letter to Primakov, 
accusing Russian television of ``manipulating public opinion against 
the interests of the state'' and becoming ``the main destabilizing 
force in society.'' Earlier this month, the Communists called for 
pulling the parliamentary accreditation from Russia's three biggest 
television stations after their cameras recorded a Communist deputy's 
anti-Semitic remarks during a committee meeting. The deputy's defenders 
accused the television stations of reporting on the comments out of 
context _ although they had recorded the deputy, Viktor Ilyukhin, 
reading a prepared text. Yeltsin reiterated his opposition to amending 
the Constitution to trim the strong presidential powers. ``If we were 
to turn into a parliamentary republic, we'd lose Russia,'' he said.
