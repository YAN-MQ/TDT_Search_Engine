Iraq will fire on warplanes patroling the no-fly zones, Iraqi Vice 
President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Saturday. Speaking on Qatar's Al-Jazeera 
television, Ramadan was asked if Iraq would accept the overflights 
of U.S. and British aircraft that maintain no-fly zones in northern 
and southern Iraq. ``We say frankly now that any violation to Iraqi 
airspace will be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan said.
