A train rammed into a bus that was crossing railroad tracks in eastern 
India Saturday, killing 12 people and injuring six others, domestic 
news agencies reported. Railway officials said impatient bus passengers, 
who had been waiting for an ``all clear'' signal at the crossing, 
snatched the keys from the guard and forcibly opened the gate to pass 
through, the Press Trust of India reported. While the bus was crossing 
the tracks, a freight train came at full speed and crashed into the 
bus. All the victims were coal miners who were on their way to work 
in the bus. The accident occurred near Dhanbad in eastern Bihar state, 
about 1,100 kilometers (660 miles) southeast of New Delhi. The train's 
speed was not immediately available.
