Two of the three remaining major leaders of the Khmer Rouge have defected 
to the Cambodian government. The political chief and leader of the 
rebel group say they now want to live as "ordinary citizens." Reporter 
Stefan Smith tells CNN, the surrender effectively ends a war which 
began when the Khmer Rouge was ousted from power in 1979. What this 
defection means is that effectively the battle with Phnom Penh and 
against the Cambodian government is formally over. They're expected 
to live somewhere in a government-loyal area and just to continue 
living normally, in return for their giving up the battle, the government 
is not likely to Hunt them down, track them down or put them inside 
a compound inside Cambodia. If the international community demends 
them to be brought to justice, that is a whole different matter altogether. 
An international court will apparently decide whether the pair will 
be tried for genocide. Nearly 2 million Cambodians were killed during 
the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror during the 1970s.
