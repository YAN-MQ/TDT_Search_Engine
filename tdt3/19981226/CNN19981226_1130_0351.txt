Iraq has kept web surfing and E-mail out of the country. Marsha Walton 
has more on this edition of tech trends. War an sanctions have left 
Iraq's communication system in terrible shape. That's one reason there 
is no E-mail inside the borders. Right now the whole country has no 
Internet access given the downgrading of our telephone communications. 
Iraqi ambassador said Iraq would like to connect its it is zens to 
the world. It is important for people to be able to open up to information 
and to get access to all of the Internet available. This is disinagain 
youous. This human rights activist said a free exchange of ideas is 
possible. It is available on a computer modum. It's one of the most 
repress repressive governments in the world. The Internet is the natural 
enemy of this kind of intolerance. They have also kept most computer 
components in the country. If Iraq had the will, they could have the 
Internet set up inspite of the sanctions. It's not clearly -- it's 
clearly not in their interest to do that. Iraqs's only official web 
site originates from New York. Many sites share the voices of Iraqis 
in other parts of the world, groups like the American Iraqi action 
network spread whatever information they can gather. The Internet 
has provided ordinary people with an opportunity to get their story 
out to the world. The most open societies in the Middle East have 
the most Internet usage, like Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinian 
areas. Other countries, such as seer ya and Saudi Arabia are lacking, 
but they are starting to catch up. But not Iraq. Though the ambassador 
said there are plans for some Internet access. There is an effort 
to try to establish some connection with the universities. After years 
of sanctions, Iraqi leaders say people are more worried about finding 
their next meal than surfing the Internet. Marsha Walton, CNN news.
