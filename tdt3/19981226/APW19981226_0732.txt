Hundreds of refugees fleeing fighting in northern Kosovo crowded into 
a rebel stronghold and rummaged for firewood to help get through another 
subfreezing night. Most of the refugees in the area west of Podujevo 
made their way by foot Saturday to Lapastica, a village still held 
by the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army after a two-day crackdown 
by Serb police and Yugoslav army units. Several villages in the region 
were destroyed in the fierce fighting that threatened to unravel an 
already shaky truce reached Oct. 12. The province was reported to 
be largely calm Saturday, but a Serb farmer was killed west of Podujevo 
by the KLA, according to international peace monitors. Ethnic Albanian 
sources reported a police attack in the same region. The farmer was 
killed by the KLA in his home in Obranca, 20 miles (32 kms) north 
of the province's capital Pristina. The rebel force controls much 
of the area. The Kosovo Information Center, close to ethnic Albanian 
pro-independence leaders, said that shortly before noon, Serb police 
approached Obranca and opened fire on nearby KLA positions. The rebels 
want independence for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic 
in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's 
population. In a typical scene in Lapastica, one room sheltered more 
than 60 refugees. One 7-year-old boy, identified only as Agron, couldn't 
speak a word, his teeth chattering after hours walking in the cold. 
His father lamented the family's situation. ``It's a shame that we 
have to beg for food and beds,'' said the man, who refused to give 
his name. The only warm member of the family of four appeared to be 
the youngest, a 3-month old girl bundled in wool and asleep in a wooden 
cradle carried by her father. Others in and near Lapastica combed 
the surroundings in the winter sun for firewood. The Serb and Yugoslav 
offensive launched Thursday reportedly killing at least nine people. 
The crackdown posed the gravest threat yet to the agreement that halted 
months of violence between Serbs and guerrillas trying to gain Kosovo's 
independence. The United States, France and the European Union have 
warned both sides not to continue the violence. In October, NATO threatened 
airstrikes against the Serbs as punishment for their crackdown that 
began in February, in which hundreds died and 300,000 were forced 
to flee their homes. The NATO attacks were put on hold after a cease-fire 
was reached and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pulled out some 
of his forces.
