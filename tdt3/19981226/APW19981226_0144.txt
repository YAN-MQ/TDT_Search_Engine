Assailants shot to death two boys and a young man in a region in eastern 
South Africa that has been plagued by violence, police said Saturday. 
One 21-year-old man survived the Christmas Day attack that killed 
another 21-year-old and two 13-year-old boys, said police spokesman 
Bala Naidoo. No suspects have been caught and police did not know 
the motive behind the attack, which occurred at 8:15 p.m. Friday in 
a house in Umlazi, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of the coastal city 
of Durban. Police were discounting any link with an attack on a Christmas 
Eve party that killed eight people in the town of Margate. Those killings 
happened after the gunmen apaprently tried to crash the party but 
were refused entry. ``It's totally unrelated to the Christmas Eve 
killings, which happened 250 kilometers (155 miles) away,'' Naidoo 
said. Both attacks happened in KwaZulu-Natal province, which in revent 
years has been hit by violence, much of it politically inspired. Fighting 
between followers of the Zulu-Nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and 
of the African National Congress in the years before all-race elections 
in 1994 killed more than 10,000 people.
