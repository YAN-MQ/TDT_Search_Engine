Many toy makers are adding electronics to their lists. Here is is 
a fur by. They are the next evolutionary step for the virtual pet. 
Mattel has a trio The Barbie photo designer digital camera is a real 
digital camera. The fun of it is that it works with the Barbie photo 
designer CD-rom. So for the first time ever, girls enter the world 
of Barbie on their computers. This is not your father's hot wheels. 
Its high-tech standard feature -- a virtual pet-like interface gives 
access to the tiny onboard computer. This computer allows you to check 
speeds, count laps, tells you how many miles you traveled, do a lot 
of fun interactive things like never before. Sticker price, about 
$12. Dennis, welcome to the hundred-acre wood. Christopher Robin would 
love this! "My interactive Pooh" is a CD-rom-based toy that may help 
him shed the moniker of "bear of very little brain." My interactive 
Pooh is a personalized toy. He will actually say a child's name. You 
can play with Pooh on the computer, and you can download information 
and play with him away from the computer. There are so many things 
we can do. Skeptical parents might wonder, do these microchipped marvels 
take away from a child's own imagination? That technology brings out 
imagination to a brand-new height and really allows them to role-play 
like never before. With toys this smart, Santa doesn't have to slide 
down the chimney with them any more -- now, he downloads. Dennis Michael,
