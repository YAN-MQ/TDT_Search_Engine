Tobacco road is feeling the impact of the industry's settlement with 
states, over the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses. Recently, 
the RJ Reynolds company announced plans to lay off 1,300 employees. 
Aram Roston looks at what the cutbacks could mean for the area. 50-year-old 
Winnie Bledsoe is preparing to can some deer meat. The RJ Reynolds 
tobacco plant where he works as a mechanic is closed for the holidays. 
A lot of people dependent on tobacco in this area, especially. If 
I didn't have it, I don't know what I'd do. That's all I've ever done 
is worked at Reynolds. Mr. Bledsoe, who has worked there for 20 years, 
says he does not believe he'll lose his job in the upcoming layoffs. 
But his friend Sylvia Lawson, helping with the deer meat, has worked 
there 22 years, and she says she's concerned. I'm scared myself, because 
you don't know how they're going to go about doing this. And I don't 
see why on earth they want to do this right here on the holidays hear 
either. Billy hooker doing some last-minute Christmas shopping has 
worked at an RJ Reynolds plant in Winston Salem for 32 years. He says 
he won't be laid off because of his seniority. He's not the first 
in his family to work there. My daddy worked there more than 40 years. 
My momma was there 35 years. Still, hooker's 27-year-old son found 
a different line of work. Even before the settlement, RJ Reynolds 
was slimming down. It is no longer the largest employer in this area. 
And with these cuts, there will only be 7,500 workers in the U.S. 
half the number there were ten years ago. The city of Winston Salem 
says the laid-off workers may eventually be absorbed into other industries, 
but the cuts will hurt. Well, there's 1,000 more jobs now for our 
county over the next year. And anytime you lose that number, that's 
significant. RJ Reynolds has not announced when those 1,300 pink slips 
will be handed out. Aram Roston, CNN, Forsyth county, North Carolina.
