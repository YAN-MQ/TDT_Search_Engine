Iraq said Saturday that its anti-aircraft gunners drove off an attack 
by ``enemy'' warplanes that flew in from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality of 
the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe warplanes 
from the United States and Britain. The United States has aircraft 
in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Britain also bases aircraft in Kuwait. 
In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley 
said U.S. aircraft flew over Iraq on Saturday, but ``they reported

Iraqis seem to be loosing off anti-aircraft fire left, right and center,'' 
the spokesman said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
The United States, Britain and France maintain a ``no-fly zone'' over

States and Britain ended four days of airstrikes against Iraq on Dec. 
19. The strikes were carried out after U.N. weapons inspectors released 
a report saying that Baghdad was blocking their work. Iraq says that 
62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in the bombardment. 
The increased reports of airspace violations and the Saturday incident 
may be an indication that Baghdad intends to challenge the no-fly 
zone over southern Iraq. Iraq has never recognize the zone and has 
occasionally confronted aircraft flying in the area. The last major 
incident in the zone was in June. U.S. officials have said that a 
U.S. F-16 warplane fired a missile at an anti-aircraft site after 
Iraqi radar targeted British warplanes patrolling the zone. Iraq denied
