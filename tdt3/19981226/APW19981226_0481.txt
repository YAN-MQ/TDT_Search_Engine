Three Mexican prisoners released hostages they had held for than 20 
hours and surrendered Saturday, a prison systems official said. The 
siege at the Reclusorio Sur prison ended peacefully about 12:30 p.m., 
the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Prison officials 
still had no information about how many hostages had been held. News 
reports gave varying figures, ranging from eight to more than 20. 
According to officials, four inmates, hoping to escape, started a 
riot Friday afternoon while the prison was filled with Christmas visitors. 
When the escape plans were foiled, they took hostages. The prisoners 
were said to be armed with guns and grenades, according to news reports. 
There were no reports of serious injuries. Four hostages were released 
over a three hour period Saturday morning, the prison system said 
in a statement. They included two prisoners, a 76-year-old woman and 
a pregnant woman who had been visiting relatives. A fifth hostage, 
a nurse, managed to escape. One of the inmates surrendered Saturday 
morning and officials continued to negotiate with the remaining three. 
It was not known what the inmates were demanding. After negotiating 
with them Friday night, Jaime Alvarez Ramos, the city's director of 
prisons, said that at that moment they were only asking for cigarettes, 
food and water.
