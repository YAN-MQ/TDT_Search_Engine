The Japanese doomsday cult accused of a 1995 gas attack on Tokyo subways 
is trying to regroup and recruit new members, a news report said Saturday. 
The Aum Shinri Kyo religious cult is one of several groups monitored 
by Japan's Public Security Investigation Agency in a report released 
Saturday, Kyodo News service said. ``Aum is actively attempting to 
bring back former members and recruiting new members on a nationwide 
basis, while initiating advertising campaigns and acquiring necessary 
capital,'' Kyodo quoted the report as saying. The agency's report 
also discussed Japanese right-wing and international terrorist groups, 
Kyodo said. A top Aum member was sentenced to death in October for 
the murder of a lawyer and his family. Other members including guru 
Shoko Asahara are on trial for the subway attack, which killed a dozen.
