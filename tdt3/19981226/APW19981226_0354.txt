Sandro Cherchi, a sculptor who was a founder of an anti-fascist artistic 
movement in Italy in the 1930s, has died in his home in Turin, Italian 
RAI state TV reported Saturday. No cause of death was given for Cherchi, 
who was 87. Born in Genoa in 1911, he moved to Milan in 1936, where, 
two years later, he helped found, along with painter Renato Guttoso, 
sculptor Giacomo Manzu, writer Ernesto Treccani and others, the dynamic 
artistic and literary movement known as ``Corrente'' (Italian for 
current as well as for electricity). Cherchi's scuptures included 
work in plastic. They were exhibited at the Venice Biennale art exhibit 
in years 1948 through 1956. Among those holding works permanently 
of the artist is Florence's Uffizi museum. While considered to be 
in the abstract genre, his works reflected a streak of realism as 
well. Details on funeral arrangements and any survivors were not immediately 
available.
