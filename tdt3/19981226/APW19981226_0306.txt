Italian club Juventus has made a dlrs-12 million offer to entice Galatasaray 
striker Hakan Sukur, news reports said Saturday. Istanbul club Galatasaray, 
suffering from a financial crisis, left the decision up to Sukur, 
daily Hurriyet said. But sports daily Foto Mac reported that Sukur 
was not eager to go back to Italy. ``I already closed the Italian 
venture,'' Foto Mac quoted Sukur as saying. ``I want to conclude my 
soccer career in a Galatasaray uniform.'' Sukur joined Galatasaray 
three years ago after a brief stint with Turin club Juventus. He scored 
32 league goals last season for the reigning champion Galatasaray. 
Juventus top manager Luciano Moggi reportedly traveled to Istanbul 
to discuss the transfer of Sukur, another sports daily, Fanatik said. 
Juventus club offices were closed Saturday, a national holiday in 
Italy. In Turkey, Galatasaray officials were not available for comment.
