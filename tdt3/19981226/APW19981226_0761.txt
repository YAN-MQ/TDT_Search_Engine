Union director Billy Hunter, anxious to close a deal but fearful of 
getting burned, said negotiations to end the NBA lockout should resume 
later this week. Hunter, speaking by telephone from Oakland, California, 
said he plans to return Sunday to New York. ``Once I get back, I'll 
reach out to David (Stern),'' Hunter said Saturday, adding that the 
next negotiation session probably will include only one or two representatives 
from each side. No talks have been held since Wednesday night, when 
Stern and Hunter met for several hours in Los Angeles at the office 
of agent Leonard Armato. There was an expectation that talks might 
resume this weekend, but nothing ever came to fruition. ``There's 
nothing new,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Saturday. Stern 
hasn't commented publicly in more than a week, but Granik used a familiar 
line after the Los Angeles meeting in saying the discussions ``went 
nowhere.'' The opposing sides, fighting over how to distribute some 
dlrs 2 billion in annual revenue, must make a deal by mid-January 
to save a 45- to 50-game season. The league has scheduled a Board 
of Governors meeting for Jan. 7, and Granik said he will recommend 
canceling the season if a deal isn't reached by then. Although many 
complicated issues remain in dispute, it has become apparent that 
the one critical area that is the key to a settlement is the league's 
insistence on setting an absolute maximum salary for players with 
more than six years of experience. The owners want the maximum salary 
tied to a percentage of the salary cap, while the players have proposed 
a luxury tax on any owner who signs a player to a multiyear contract 
starting at more than dlrs 15 million. The union has already offered 
a dlrs 10 million limit on the starting salary for any player with 
less than seven years of experience. Hunter has said he will not accept 
a maximum salary on veteran players unless the league reciprocates 
with an equally concessionary gesture that brings the sides to closure. 
Presumably, that would include the union's proposed minimum salaries 
and an additional salary cap exception tied to the median salary. 
The union also would want the league to withdraw several proposed 
changes to salary cap rules, including the elimination of opt-out 
clauses, the toughening of trade rules, the reduction of performance 
bonuses and the elimination of signing bonuses and trade kickers. 
Hunter admitted Saturday he is wary of giving the owners another concession 
and then having them walk away from the bargaining table saying it 
isn't enough. Some agents are counseling Hunter to wait until the 
Jan. 7 deadline before trying to close the deal.
