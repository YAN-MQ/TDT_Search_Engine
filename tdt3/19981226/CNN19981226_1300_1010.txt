Middle-income Americans may get a break from uncle Sam this year. 
The joint committee on taxation announced this week, those earning 
between $40,000 and $75,000 will pay less in federal taxes this year 
than in 1997. That's due in part to new tax credits for children and 
education. The biggest tax increases will be carried by those making 
$200,000 or more.
