Police said Saturday they arrested a leading member of a gang that 
kidnapped prize racing pigeons and collected ransoms totaling more 
than 50 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.5 million) from the owners. 
Shen Pao-tien was arrested Saturday in Ilan, eastern Taiwan, but six 
other members of his gang were still at large, police said. The gang 
had kidnapped about 2,000 pigeons over the past two years, said police, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The birds were captured with 
nets during Taiwan's popular pigeon races and their owners identified 
through the numbered rings the birds wear around their ankles, police 
said. Ransom demands topped 1 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 3,000) 
for some of the birds, they said. Some owners were reluctant to contact 
police because the kidnappers have been known to cut off the foot 
of a bird and mail it to the owner. The United Evening News said some 
gangsters bribed race employees to tip them off about the times and 
routes of the races. In many races, less than half of the racing pigeons 
safely reached the final destination. Despite cheating and kidnapping, 
the races remain popular with gamblers because prizes can reach 100 
million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 300,000), the report said.
