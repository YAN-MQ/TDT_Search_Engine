Sometimes actions speak louder than words, especially in the art of 
pantomime. Jennifer eccleston reports the silent shows are a holiday 
tradition in Britain. Seen a series of efforts to rewrite the endangered 
species act. The most fierce debates have centered on rights and what 
happens to private property and endangers species. They tend to hit 
people with this. As for the bottom line, the government lists only 
11 species, out of 1,195, that have fully recovered from endangered 
status. And six of them don't even live in the United States. On the 
other hand, the endangered species act has changed the rules for changing 
the landscape. Saving animals has meant saving habitats, forests and 
wetlands, beaches and deserts. Preserving them has meant preserving 
the face of America. Natalie pawelski, CNN, Washington.
