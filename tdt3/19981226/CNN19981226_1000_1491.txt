Almost everyone wants to preserve the wildlife that exists in America. 
But after a quarter century of government regulation, there's still 
disagreement over how to do it. Natalie pawelski reports. American 
skies without the American symbol. The west without grizzly bears. 
The California coast without Gray whales. That's where many Americans 
believed the country was headed before Congress created the endangered 
species act, signed into law by President Nixon 25 years ago. Since 
then, there's no doubt Eagles, grizzly bears, Gray whales and other 
animals are doing better. But can the law take the credit? In the 
short time that the endangered species act has been around, it's helped 
save from extinction probably more than 1,100 American species. The 
endangered species act has been a dismal failure. In 25 years, the 
act has yet to bring a single species off the list into recovery. 
Over the years, protecting less charismatic species, from the spotted 
owl to the Delhi sands flower-loving fly, has provoked rancorous debate. 
But in general, support for the endangered species act has remained 
high. The American people love this law. By majorities of 75% or 80%, 
they want to protect species and don't want to consciously drive them 
to extinction. The question is not, should we be trying to protect 
species? Or should we be trying to be sure that our environmental 
heritage is protected for our children? The question is, are we doing 
a good job of it, and are we using the right policies? Over the last 
several years, Capitol Hill has seen a series of efforts to rewrite 
the endangered species act. The most fierce debates have centered 
on individual rights, on what happens when private property and endangered 
species collide. We've given the government a hammer and said, you 
know, "go out and conserve wildlife with it." And what they do is 
they tend to hit people. As for the bottom line, the government lists 
only 11 species, out of 1,195, that have fully recovered from endangered 
status. And six of them don't even live in the United States. On the 
other hand, the endangered species act has changed the rules for changing 
the landscape. Saving animals has meant saving habitats, forests and 
wetlands, beaches and deserts. Preserving them has meant preserving 
the face of America. Natalie pawelski, CNN, Washington.
