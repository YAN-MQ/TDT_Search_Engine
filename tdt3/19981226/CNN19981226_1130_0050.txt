On this day after Christmas, stores are giving shoppers the gift of 
low prices. After a disappointing holiday retail season, stores are 
depending on after-Christmas sales to boost revenues. Some stores 
are offering discounts as high as 70%, and many have included extra 
discount coupons in their newspaper ads. Clothing and toys are getting 
the biggest markdowns. The president of bloomingdale's says people 
have become more savvy when it comes to buying, and have intentionally 
put off many purchases until after the holidays, in hopes they'll 
be cheaper.
