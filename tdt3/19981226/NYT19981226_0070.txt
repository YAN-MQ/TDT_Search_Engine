At the age of 10, Switzerland's new president-elect _the first woman 
and first Jew in the largely ceremonial top post _ first put into 
practice her determined approach to overcoming obstacles. It was 1950 
when the new president-elect, Ruth Dreifuss, encountered a teacher 
who made slighting comments about Jews. In a notebook, she wrote down, 
in some detail, the history of the Jewish people and their persecution. 
Taking it to the teacher, she said: ``I'm weak in spelling. Could 
you correct this?'' Four days later, she recounted, he returned the 
notebook without a word. He made no anti-Semitic remarks after that, 
she recalled in an interview in her office in the Swiss capital, Bern. 
Ms. Dreifuss, elected this month, is a symbol of success for women 
in a country where women did not get to vote at the national level 
until 1971. She was elected, by Parliament, to the one-year presidential 
post _ which rotates among the seven-member Swiss Cabinet, largely 
by seniority. There was little public commentary about her being Jewish. 
She will also represent a nation recently wrenched out of its complacency 
by attacks on its most cherished myths about its neutrality in World 
War II, and a country that is still struggling to shape its future 
in Europe. The ferocious debate over national identity is where Ms. 
Dreifuss, who will be 59 next month, is determined to play an active 
role. ``My duty is to help bring Switzerland to the next century with 
an open mind and open eyes,'' she said. ``We need to find a more rational 
way to understand our history, not only in the Second World War. We 
are seeing it as more complex and conflict loaded.'' Ms. Dreifuss, 
who has been interior minister during the furor over Swiss wartime 
actions, said she had not been more outspoken earlier because she 
did not want to be ``exploited'' as a ``token or alibi'' Jew. In fact, 
speaking out to an international audience is a new experience for 
a woman who is known for being cautious and understated. She described 
her new post, for example, as ``a collective triumph'' for women, 
and ``in such a situation, one has the duty to open doors for the 
next.'' A left-leaning former union activist, she was elected to the 
federal Cabinet six years ago, becoming its second woman and the first 
member from the country's tiny Jewish population of 18,000. Her election 
to the Cabinet was considered a breakthrough for women in the traditional 
male Swiss political structure. Thousands of women had rallied in 
the street in 1993 to protest after Parliament rejected another woman 
whose personal style was considered more controversial. ``I reassure 
people because I look a little plain,'' she explained in a 1993 interview. 
She does not do especially well in public-opinion polls, though, apparently 
because of her tough stances on revising the nation's health insurance. 
Ms. Dreifuss has also drawn criticism for pushing Switzerland to address 
its serious drug problem. Some Swiss may squirm at Ms. Dreifuss' efforts 
to have the country come to terms with its troubled past, but her 
position has not been adversarial. ``We will never accept a collective 
fault,'' she said firmly, upholding the government's position that 
banks but not ``the Swiss men and women who lived in the dramatic 
years of the war'' may be held accountable. Ms. Dreifuss is thoroughly 
Swiss. Her family has been in Switzerland for three centuries. But 
she was born in World War II, and she said that her earliest memories 
included the constant fear that Germany would invade. ``I was born 
when there was a continent-broad system aimed at the extermination 
of the same people as I was,'' she said. ``Don't think this isn't 
constitutive of a personality.'' Her family lived in the northeastern 
city of St. Gallen, but her father, who volunteered with a group that 
helped Jewish refugees, was caught helping falsify documents to protect 
those fleeing the Holocaust. He lost his job in a textile importing 
company, and when she was 5 years old, the family moved to Geneva. 
Ms. Dreifuss earned a degree in economics from Geneva University. 
Her family's wartime experience left her well versed in Swiss sensitivities 
to its refugee policy toward Jews in that era. According to estimates, 
60,000 Jews tried to enter the country during the war, and half or 
more were turned away. Next spring, an international panel of historians 
appointed by the government will report on the wartime refugee policy. 
Last August, Swiss banks agreed to a $1.25 billion settlement over 
money that Holocaust victims deposited in Swiss banks. ``There is 
relief now that the banks made a settlement,'' she said. ``But the 
government's work is not finished.''
