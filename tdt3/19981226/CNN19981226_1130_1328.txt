In NFL news, dolphin receiver Lamar Thomas and cornerback Jerry Wilson 
have been given two-year contract extensions. Thomas has been a key 
figure recently in the dolphins' offense. He caught three touchdowns 
in Miami's Monday win over Denver that helped the club claim a playoff 
spot. The dolphins are in Atlanta this Sunday, and could host a game-one 
playoff with a victory.
