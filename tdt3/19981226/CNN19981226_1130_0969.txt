This year, the financial markets haven't followed most predictions. 
But that hasn't stopped forecasters from making more. Katharine Barrett 
reports. With the books closing on 1998, Wall Street is looking ahead 
to the next 12 months. As always, there are Bulls, bears and everything 
in between. Among the more pessimistic firms -- Merrill Lynch and 
Goldman sachs see a Strong start to '99, but a gradual rise in unemployment 
and slowdown in growth in the second half, and an increasing risk 
of recession. Is consumer spending likely to be as strong next year 
as it was this year? Probably not, because the stock market is probably 
not going to continue to go up 20% to 30% a year. The other vulnerability 
is capital spending. But most forecast lower interest rates next year, 
and continued low inflation, that leads some to be more optimistic. 
Also up-beat -- bear Stearns chief economist sees falling unemployment 
and, at last, an economic uptrend in Asia. I've been forecasting much 
stronger growth. And I continue to forecast 3% growth into 1999. So, 
this economy works very well with very rapid growth and very slow 
inflation. The strength continues to come from an American consumer 
whose wealth has been increased in real terms at prices that have 
come down and whose income has that much more buying power. That's 
one reason the most important indicator for 1999 may be how the final 
few days of the holiday shopping season shape up. Katharine Barrett,
