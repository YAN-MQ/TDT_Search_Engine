In many cities of the world, modern horsepower shares the road with 
old-fashioned horsepower, and donkey power. So, if you have a problem 
with your mode of transportation, you're as likely to need a veterinarian 
as you are a mechanic. In Cairo, ABC's Jim Wooten found a veterinarian 
who was also a hero. In these chaotic streets, clogged with modern 
transport, the lowly donkey still has a place. 250,000 of them here, 
and along with 50,000 horses, they are absolutely essential to the 
poor people of Cairo. You can't imagine if the horse is damaged or 
the donkey is damaged. That's meaning the stopping of income of the 
family. And that's what veterinarian salah wahib tries to prevent. 
A kind and gentle man, he believes keeping the animals healthy is 
his moral obligation. By helping them, he helps their owners survive. 
It is a very important job in my mind. At this clinic the brook hospital 
for animals, founded 60 years ago by an ang lirb woman, Dr. wahib, 
free of charge, treats hundreds of animals each week for harness sores, 
cuts and bruises, and sends most back to the streets, back to work. 
Others are kept for X-Rays and sometimes surgery. This pregnant horse 
will have a Cesarean. Every day, after his specially equipped animal 
ambulance is prepared, he drives to markets in the slums to reach 
those who can't reach the clinic. And as he treats the animals, he's 
treated as a hero. "God save you," this woman tells him. "No one but 
you works with us," says this man, "God give you health." Three sick 
donkeys get a ride back to the always crowded clinic. What's wrong 
with this big fellow here? Road accident. Some are beyond help. This 
ancient mare hasn't eaten in weeks and Dr. wahib thinks she should 
be put out of her misery. About 25 years old and that is enough. The 
owner sadly agrees. He and his heartbroken son say good-bye. The horse 
is bathed, fed all she can eat, sweet-talked by the doctor, and at 
last, a day or so of rest before the painless end to a long-hard life. 
It's my happiness to work as a vet. We can help the animals but, really, 
we help the owners, the people. a most unusual veterinarian, salah 
wahib. His patients are animals, but his passion is people. And that, 
he says, is his duty. Jim Wooten, ABC News, Cairo.
