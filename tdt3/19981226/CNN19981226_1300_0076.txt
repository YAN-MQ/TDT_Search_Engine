President Clinton is calling on Congress to pass tougher drunk driving 
laws. In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton released a new government 
study that shows millions of Americans use alcohol or drugs before 
driving. He says December is an especially bad month. Last year, 1,300 
people were killed in alcohol-related crashes in December. He says 
the study did give some reason for optimism. There's good news to 
report. Last year, the number of people killed in alcohol-related 
crashes dropped to an all time low. For the first time since we started 
keeping track in 1975, alcohol-related deaths accounted for less than 
40% of all traffic deaths, dropped by 5% among 15 to 20 year olds. 
But we have much more to do. President Clinton says he will renew 
his call for Congress to enact legislation that requires states to 
lower blood alcohol limits to 0.08%.
