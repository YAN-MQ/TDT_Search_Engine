Iraq said Saturday that ``enemy'' planes flying from the airspace 
of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia had attacked an Iraqi anti-aircraft unit 
and were driven off. The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify 
the nationality of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' 
for the United States and Britain. Some U.S. warplanes are based in 
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and Britain also stations aircraft in Kuwait. 
In Washington, U.S. Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said 
the United States had ``no involvement in the alleged incident.'' 
In London, no British Defense Ministry spokesman was available for 
comment. The agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT) a formation 
of warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense sites, which confronted 
it and forced it to drop its load randomly.'' The report did not say 
where the apparent attack took place and gave no other details. Saturday's 
report was the second such incident reported by the Iraqi News Agency 
since the United States and Britain began four days of air attacks 
against Iraq on Dec. 16 in a bid to punish Baghdad for its alleged 
obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors. The attacks were aimed at 
military and government targets. Iraq says that 62 soldiers and more 
than 40 civilians were killed in the bombardment. The news agency 
reported on Tuesday that U.S. and British aircraft fired two ``stray 
missiles'' near the southern city of Basra. U.S. and British officials 
denied their planes were involved in any such incident. U.S. and British 
warplanes routinely patrol ``no-fly zones'' over northern and southern 
Iraq.
