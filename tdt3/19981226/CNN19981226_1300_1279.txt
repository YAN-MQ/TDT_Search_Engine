Two NFL games on the slate today, neither with playoff implications. 
The same cannot be said for Sunday's Cardinals/chargers matchup in 
tempe. An Arizona win, and it's in the playoffs for the first time 
since 1982. I think it's something this city's been waiting on for 
a long time. And I think our fans should enjoy every minute of it. 
As a team, we're enjoying certain aspects of it. But it still boils 
down to us taking care of business this weekend.
