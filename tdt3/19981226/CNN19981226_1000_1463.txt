Can you say "litigation," boys and girls? The host of the children's 
TV show "mister Rogers' neighborhood" doesn't think a new T-shirt 
showing him toting a pistol is funny. Instead of saying "won't you 
be my neighbor?", the shirt says "welcome to my hood." Rogers is suing 
the Texas-based novelty store which makes the shirts in hopes of getting 
them destroyed. His lawsuit charges the company with infringing on 
his trademark, violating his privacy and wrongly benefiting from his 
image.
