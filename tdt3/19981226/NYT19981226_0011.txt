Anyone just tuning in might imagine that a horrible new epidemic is 
sweeping over Congress, sidelining people with the dread virus of 
adultery. But this bug has been around for ages, and no one has yet 
devised a cure. What's worse, legal diagnosticians don't even agree 
on what adultery is. As usual, the laws vary from state to state _ 
some insist that the husband must be unfaithful, others the wife, 
still others allow both this option, while a few even demand that 
both lovers be married to other people. Moreover, most of what's been 
written about adultery has been written by men, though history suggests 
that women have also played a role. Amid all this uncertainty, many 
in Washington seem to favor an uncompromising Old Testament stance 
developed in the desert, long before the more sophisticated days in 
Jerusalem and Babylon, not to mention the advent of Christian forgiveness. 
However it's defined, adultery and its lies have generated a vast 
folklore of opinion and anecdote in many cultures, an almost universal 
body of common law. Herewith a few examples: _ Alexander Gross It 
shall be considered adultery to offer presents to a married woman, 
to romp with her, to touch her dress or ornaments, or to sit with 
her on a bed. _ ``Code of Manu,'' Hindu law scripture (dated 600 B.C.-300 
A.D.) I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. Come, 
let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves 
with loves. For the good man is not at home, he is gone a long journey. 
_ ``Book of Proverbs'' (circa 500 B.C.) When cheated, wife or husband 
feels the same. _ Euripides, ``Andromache'' (c. 426 B.C.) A man may 
commit adultery with a woman knowing well who she is, but not of free 
choice, because he is under the influence of passion. In that case 
he is not an unjust man, though he acts unjustly. _ Aristotle, ``The 
Nicomachean Ethics'' (c. 340 B.C.) Venus likes her thefts to be concealed. 
_ Tibullus, Roman poet, ``Elegiae'' (c. 25 B.C.) One should reflect 
deeply before having relations with married women. If it works, what 
do I risk? Is success possible without taking too many risks? When 
I have possessed her, what are the risks for the reputation of either 
of us? _ ``Jayamangala,'' a 12th-century commentary on the Kama Sutra 
by Yashodhara of India. Aroma had no intention of passively bowing 
to her fate. She simply could not accept the idea that her precious 
romance of the last 10 nights was all over just because her husband 
had come home. _ Li Yu, ``The Prayer Mat of Flesh,'' a Ming Dynasty 
novel (1634). (The title refers to the Taoist and Buddhist belief 
that sexual indulgence may lead to divine union.) What was thy cause? 
Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery! No, the wren goes 
to't, and the small gilded fly. Does lecher in my sight. Let copulation 
thrive. _ Shakespeare, ``King Lear'' (1605-6). (Lear speaking to the 
blinded Gloucester.) He that is robb'd, not knowing what is stolen, 
Let him not know it, and he's not robbed at all. _ Shakespeare, ``Othello'' 
(1604). (Othello responding to rumors of his wife's infidelity.) A 
mistress should be like a little country retreat near the town, not 
to dwell in constantly, but only for a night and away. _ William Wycherley, 
``The Country Wife'' (1675) Love ceases to be a pleasure, when it 
ceases to be a secret. _ Mrs. Aphra Behn, British playwright, ``The 
Lover's Watch'' (1686) No man worth having is true to his wife, or 
can be true to his wife, or ever was, or ever will be so. _ John Vanbrugh, 
British playwright, ``The Relapse'' (1708) No, I shall have mistresses. 
_ George II of England, responding to Queen Caroline's suggestion 
on her deathbed that he remarry (1737). Adultery is an evil only inasmuch 
as it is a theft; but we do not steal that which is given to us. _ 
Voltaire, ``Philosophical Dictionary'' (1764) Where there's marriage 
without love, there will be love without marriage. _ Benjamin Franklin, 
``Poor Richard's Almanac'' (c. 1790) It is better to have a prosaic 
husband and to take a romantic lover. _ Stendhal, ``De L'Amour'' (1822) 
What we call adultery, like what we call heresy, comes as a natural 
right. _ Victor Hugo (1802-1885), ``Pierres'' What men call gallantry, 
and gods adultery,/Is much more common where the climate's sultry. 
_ Lord Byron (1788-1824), ``Don Juan'' To console ourselves for all 
those things, happily we still have adultery! Maryland tobacco! And 
Spanish cigarette paper! _ Petrus Borel, a French writer, ``Rhapsodies'' 
(c. 1850) Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want 
to be faithless, and cannot. _ Oscar Wilde, ``The Picture of Dorian 
Gray'' (1891) To permit oneself the joys of adultery, one must be 
a pious person. _ Anatole France, ``Le lys rouge'' (1894) When one 
loves in a certain way, even betrayal becomes unimportant. _ Colette, 
```The Innocent Wife'' (1903) One man's folly is often another man's 
wife. _ Helen Rowland, ``Reflections of a Bachelor Girl'' (1909) Adultery 
is the application of democracy to love. _ H.L. Mencken, ``A Book 
of Burlesques'' (1920) The psychology of adultery has been falsified 
by conventional morals, which assume, in monogamous countries, that 
attraction to one person cannot coexist with a serious affection for 
another. Everyone knows that this is untrue. _ Bertrand Russell, ``Marriage 
and Morals'' (1929) Hypocrisy is the most difficult and nerve-racking 
vice that any man can pursue; it needs an unceasing vigilance and 
a rare detachment of spirit. It cannot, like adultery or gluttony, 
be practised at spare moments; it is a whole-time job. _ Somerset 
Maugham, ``Cakes and Ale'' (1930) Adultery, sometimes necessary plot 
material, must not be explicitly treated, or justified, or presented 
attractively. _ An early code to ``govern the making of motion and 
talking pictures by the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors 
of America, Inc.'' (1930) The Tasmanians, who never committed adultery, 
are now extinct. _ Somerset Maugham, ``The Breadwinner'' (1930) The 
aura of the theocratic death penalty for adultery still clings to 
America, even outside New England, and multiple divorce, which looks 
to the European like serial polygamy, is the moral solution to the 
problem of the itch. Love comes into it too, of course, but in Europe 
we tend to see marital love as an eternity which encompasses hate 
and also indifference: when we promise to love we really mean that 
we promise to honour a contract. Americans, seeming to take marriage 
with not enough seriousness, are really taking love and sex with too 
much. _ Anthony Burgess, ``You've Had Your Time'' (1990) Adultery 
is hard on a small town because it can cause sudden population loss, 
and usually it's the wrong people who get run out. _ Garrison Keillor, 
in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times (1994)
