For many, today, the 26th of December, is simply the day after. But 
some holidays, some celebrations, are just getting under way. It's 
the first day of kwanzaa, the lighting of candles marks this african-American 
holiday which ends in an exchange of handmade and educational gifts. 
And here in London, this day after Christmas is called boxing day. 
It's a British tradition. But do most people here know the meaning 
of boxing day? It's sort of a holiday after Christmas to recover from 
the Christmas pudding. No, I don't go into the history of things. 
I can't tell you. You shouldn't have asked, you Americans. You shouldn't 
have asked these things that say what is boxing day. I have no idea, 
but you won't tell anybody else. For the record, boxing day apparently 
got its name from alms boxes, collection boxes in Churches, with the 
money going to the poor this day.
