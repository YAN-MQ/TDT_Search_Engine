The race to be the first to circle the earth in a balloon is still 
on. Next week another balloon team takes off just days after the last 
team was forced down in the pacific. ABC's Lisa Salters has the latest. 
It's called the team remaximum balloon, 1ked yuld to lift off next 
week. Once fully inflated this balloon will reach as high as the empire 
state building. Sponsored by American real estate tycoon Dave lynnger, 
team remaximum plans to use a different strategy and the Branson faucet 
team. It will sail 20,000 miles higher. Where winds you were constant 
and not subject to weather conditions. We also are going for the high 
altitude record, the distance record, and the duration record. They 
also plan to take a southern Hemisphere route whicll flna theagreswill 
B teon in ros of at Lea four other balloon teams planning flights. 
They all seem undaunted by the failure of the Richard Branson team. 
It splash landed off the coast of Hawaii yesterday morning, and had 
to be rescued by the coast guard. Weigh really thought we were going 
to make it and we came up against this brick wall of bad weather and 
we just, you know, bounced at it and it wouldn't let us through. The 
Branson balloon took off from Morocco an December 18th. It had been 
enjoying 200-mile-an-hour tail winds halfway around the world. Until 
it reached the pacific ocean. That's where it hit a pocket of low 
pressure that dramatically dropped the winds to just 16 miles an hour. 
The balloon has a lot of motor, no other motor than the wind. If the 
wind stops, you stop. That doesn't necessarily mean the Branson team 
will stop trying, nor will other balloonists determined to sail into 
the record books. List a Salters.
