Two brothers were arrested Saturday in connection with the 1997 slayings 
of two human rights workers and one worker's father. Juan Carlos and 
Fernando Gonzalez were captured in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest 
city, and charged in the execution-style killings of Mario Calderon, 
Elsa Alvarado and her father, Carlos Alvarado, said police operations 
chief Gen. Alfredo Salgado. The couple was killed along with Alvarado's 
father in their Bogota apartment in May 1997 by hitmen suspected of 
working for a right-wing paramilitary group. The gunmen gained entry 
posing as federal agents, then forced the victims to kneel on the 
floor before spraying them with machine-gun fire. The woman's mother 
survived eight gunshot wounds, and the couple's 18-month-old son escaped 
injury by hiding in a closet. Calderon, a former Jesuit priest, and 
Alvarado worked at the Center for Research and Popular Education, 
a nongovernmental organization that promotes peace and human rights. 
Their murders, followed by the killings this year of two other prominent 
rights workers, prompted outrage and government promises to crack 
down on the right-wing militias.
