In its latest challenge to the United States and Britain, Iraq declared 
that it will fire on warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones that Washington 
and its allies imposed after the Gulf War. The United States and Britain 
said their aircraft would continue to enforce the no-fly zones and 
pilots would respond to any threats. ``Iraq knows that it should not 
interfere with those flights, and our pilots can act in self-defense 
if they feel threatened at any time,'' National Security Council spokesman 
P. J. Crowley said in Washington. A Ministry of Defense spokesman 
in London said all British and American aircraft ``operate to a very 
strict set of rules of engagement. If aircraft are threatened those 
rules of engagement do allow the return of fire.'' The United States, 
Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in 1991-92 to halt air 
attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north and Shiite Muslim rebels 
in the south. French aircraft no longer patrol the northern zone, 
but still help to maintain the southern zone. A week after a U.S.-British 
bombing campaign against Iraq ended, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin 
Ramadan said his government would not allow flights over northern 
and southern Iraq. ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi 
airspace will be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan told Qatar's Al-Jazeera 
television Saturday. Iraq has never recognized the zones and has occasionally 
confronted aircraft flying in the area. Asked why Iraq had not fired 
previously on planes enforcing the no-fly zones, Ramadan said, ``When 
you want to restore your rights, you choose the suitable time and 
circumstances.'' State-controlled Iraqi media have issued almost daily 
reports of violations of the country's airspace since the United States 
and Britain ended four days of airstrikes on Dec. 19. Ramadan's interview 
was conducted in Baghdad hours after Iraq said its anti-aircraft gunners 
had driven off an attack by ``enemy'' warplanes trying to hit an air 
defense site. The official Iraqi News Agency said the planes flew 
in from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait but it did not identify their nationality. 
Iraq usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe warplanes from the 
United States and Britain. The United States and Britain base aircraft 
in Kuwait and the United States also has aircraft in Saudi Arabia. 
Washington and London denied any attacks on Iraq. In London, a Defense 
Ministry spokesman speaking with customary anonymity said a British 
pilot Saturday ``did sight anti-aircraft fire but he did not consider 
it hostile.'' The United States and Britain launched the attacks after 
U.N. weapons inspectors released a report saying Baghdad had not fully 
cooperated as it promised in November when airstrikes were called 
off. Iraq has said the inspectors will not be allowed to return.
