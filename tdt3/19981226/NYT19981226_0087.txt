Here in the shaded glades of live oaks and, yes, December roses, one 
of California's oldest civic traditions lives on in these cold nights 
and crisp mornings. This is the place where thousands of square feet 
of chicken wire, hundreds of gallons of glue and acres of seeds, plants 
and flowers somehow become the Tournament of Roses Parade each New 
Year's Day. The festival was founded in 1890 by the Valley Hunt Club 
of Pasadena to celebrate California's mild winters, and it has evolved 
into an indelible mix of blue-blood boosterism and up-to-the-minute 
Hollywood hype. Volunteer ``petal-pushers'' join forces with deep-pocketed 
sponsors like Eastman Kodak and Dr Pepper willing to spend up to $300,000 
to promote their products to a worldwide television audience of 325 
million viewers in 100 countries. The hoopla has even inspired a subversive 
counter-event, the annual Doo Dah Parade in late November, in which 
an anarchic group of local wags sponsors a stream of Elvis impersonators, 
dogs in drag and other oddments, mocking the cherished, polite rituals 
of the Rose Parade and its organizers. But for the real parade participants, 
the job is deadly serious, and this is their crunch time. At Phoenix 
Decorating, which builds half the parade's floats in the Rosemont 
Pavilion in the shadow of the Rose Bowl, workers are finishing up 
what may be this season's most elaborate offering, Universal Studios' 
five-story facsimile of Dr. Seuss' Cat in the Hat, promoting the opening 
of Universal's new Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Fla., 
next year. ``I think it's safe to say it's THE float this year,'' 
said Phoenix Decorating president Bill Lofthouse, a former painting 
contractor who has been building Rose Parade floats for 43 years, 
as he surveyed a recent test of the cat's hinged neck, which bends 
down to let the float clear a 17{-foot overpass along the parade route. 
``This has been one of the really challenging ones.'' With his trademark 
striped stovepipe of red-and-white carnations and a black and white 
coat of crushed sweet rice, black firegrass, Japanese seaweed and 
onion seed, the smiling cat will roll down Colorado Boulevard on New 
Year's morning, propelled by a diesel engine and animated by gas-powered 
generators and a half-mile of hydraulic hose, as stunt actors playing 
Thing 1 and Thing 2 hang out of the hat and other actors portraying 
other Universal characters, like Spider-Man and Popeye, pop out of 
a big red box. Given the recent turmoil and turnover among Universal's 
top movie management, one producer at a rival studio suggested wryly 
that it might be more appropriate to have studio executives popping 
out of the box, scrambling for cover in the crowd. Corporations and 
studios have been sponsoring Rose Parade floats for decades; MGM built 
a flower-filled Munchkinland 60 years ago to promote ``The Wizard 
of Oz.'' Universal had not offered one since 1970, but as studio designers 
watched the parade last year, they decided that its worldwide television 
audience of a third of a billion people would be the ideal captive 
market. ``This was one of the easiest business decisions I ever made,'' 
said Cathy Nichols, chairman and chief executive of Universal's recreation 
group, which oversees its theme parks, including the famous studio 
tour here. ``It's an over-the-top entertainment experience, and that's 
a perfect match.'' The cat will have a coveted spot near the front 
of the march (fourth in line) but it is hardly the only spectacular 
offering in this year's parade, whose theme is ``Echoes of the Century.'' 
American Honda is sponsoring a tribute to space exploration with a 
giant Buzz Aldrin floating above a lunar landing module, as Neil Armstrong's 
line about ``one small step . . .'' plays over a sound system. The 
city of St. Louis has a float drawn by flesh-and-blood Clydesdales, 
with more flower-and-glue horses on board, along with a flowery mock-up 
of Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, which was built in San 
Diego. In any given year, the 56-float parade has six to eight times 
as many applicants as it can accommodate, and it takes only about 
half a dozen new participants a year. Every surface must be covered 
with real plants, flowers or seeds, and crass commercialism is frowned 
on. ``We sort of espouse a tradition in which the companies offer 
greeting cards to the world,'' said Steven Leland, the parade's director 
of sponsorship and marketing. ``It's not a hard sell.'' For Craig 
Hanna, Universal's director of attraction development, designing a 
flower-covered float, with room for one driver, two spotters, a sound 
technician with a 20,000-watt audio system and three animators to 
run the moving parts, like the spinning goldfish bowl, was a shift 
from creating theme park rides. He found that working in flowers was 
not so easy. ``I do not,'' he said, ``have a green thumb.''
