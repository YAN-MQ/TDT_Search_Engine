In Cuba, Christmas is an official holiday now. The communist government 
even alwed the Roman Catholic church to broadcast a Christmas greeting 
on state radio yesterday. It's the latest in a series of signs that 
relations between church and state are defrosting. And as ABC's Deborah 
Amos reports, this has brought about a competition for congregants. 
This house, in one of Havana's poorest districts, becomes a Church 
one evening a week. The worshipers, all neighbors, can't afford a 
regular bus trip to downtown churches. They joined this congregation 
a year ago, when minister Hector mendez brought the church to them, 
setting up worship in this living room. Some 3,000 house Churches 
have opened recently. Most are Protestant, as religious leaders compete 
for Cuban souls. All of the Churches are growing because of people 
need faith. In some provinces, the Protestant Churches are drawing 
members faster than the Catholics. And some denominations are getting 
new recruits by offering something more than food for the soul. The 
lady of charity Catholic church offers free meals for the poor. "Thanks 
to the church, I have a plate of food," says this old man. Such open 
social programs were once forbidden by the communist government. But 
this opening to religion was a condition of the Pope's historic visit 
last year. Since then, classes in religious instruction have become 
popular. But some question all this newfound faith. Quite a lot of 
the religious boom is a result of the difficulties in the economic 
situation. Most families here struggle just to get the basics. Soap 
and medicine is often unavailable in government shops. The government 
sees church programs as a way to share the economic Burden. For the 
church, it's a draw for new members. They are going to church to get 
a bag with the basic things they need for life, or is it that really 
they want to have a Christian experience? For many, this is the Christian 
experience, ministering to the poor with hope that religious belief 
will follow. Deborah Amos, ABC News, Havana, Cuba.
