Two influential democratic senators are drafting a compromise censure 
of President Clinton, which could avert an impeachment trial. CNN 
has learned Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Robert Byrd of 
West Virginia are trying to craft a proposal that will meet constitutional 
requirements, and also draw republican support. The White House has 
been watching both senators closely for clues on how they might approach 
the upcoming impeachment trial.
