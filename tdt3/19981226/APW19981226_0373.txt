Borussia Dortmund announced Saturday the Bundesliga club has ended 
months of effort by finally getting Inter Milan keeper Jens Lehmann. 
The German international, a backup at the Italian club, will transfer 
for 7 million marks (dlrs 4.3 million) and sign a three-year contract. 
Lehmann replaces his national team rival Stefan Klos, who agreed to 
terms with the Glasgow Rangers shortly before Christmas. The 29-year-old 
Lehmann stayed in Italy just four months after transferring over the 
summer from Schalke, where he was one of the heroes in the German 
club's 1997 UEFA Cup triumph. Lehmann chafed over being benched in 
favor of Sebastiano Rossi at Inter after just a few matches. ``I can't 
take it anymore. I'm not willing to have an existence as Rossi' subsitute,'' 
Lehmann told the German sports agnecy SID. Veteran defender Juergen 
Kohler, another former Serie A player, extended his contract at Dortmund 
another year until June 30, 2000.
