A Turkey in Oregon is spending his holidays shredding snow, instead 
of being the guest of honor on a local table. The 12-pound bird, named 
Christmas, first took to the slopes Thanksgiving. He's believed to 
be the only snowboard-riding Turkey in the world. He does his shredding 
on the slopes of Mt. bachelor, where he's become a Mascot and even 
appeared in television commercials for the resort.
