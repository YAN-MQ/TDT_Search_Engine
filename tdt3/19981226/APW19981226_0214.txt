Two leaders of the Khmer Rouge reign of terror in the 1970s defected 
to the government Saturday in a deal that could signal the end of 
the bloodstained revolutionary group but is unlikely to bring them 
to justice. Prime Minister Hun Sen said he personally negotiated the 
final touches on the defections Friday night, the 20th anniversary 
of the Christmas 1978 invasion by Vietnam that toppled the genocidal 
regime. Khieu Samphan, the Khmer Rouge's nominal leader, and political 
chief Nuon Chea said in letters read by Hun Sen on national radio 
that they wished to become ``ordinary citizens.'' Hun Sen later brushed 
aside questions whether they would be brought to trial for the deaths 
of as many as 2 million Cambodians, indicating a deal had been struck 
allowing them to surrender in exchange for not being tried. ``We should 
not talk about any court,'' Hun Sen said. ``This is a time when we 
should talk about reconciliation.'' The defections leave at large 
only one major Khmer Rouge figure, the one-legged general Ta Mok, 
known as ``The Butcher,'' and less than 100 die-hard loyalists. Om 
Yentieng, an aide to Hun Sen, said that Ta Mok's arrest is still sought. 
Hun Sen said in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he ``would 
like to warmly welcome the two personalities'' in the interests of 
``national reconstruction and peace.'' The defectors were key players 
in the Khmer Rouge's rule after the Maoist revolutionaries won a civil 
war in 1975. The Khmer Rouge emptied the cities and sent the populations 
to agricultural labor camps in the countryside. Perhaps one Cambodian 
in five died of overwork, disease, starvation and systematic executions. 
Longtime Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot _ purged in a bloody power struggle 
last year _ died in April while under house arrest by his ex-comrades. 
Khmer Rouge leaders said he suffered a heart attack. Cambodia's current 
leaders and the United States have said in the past that they wanted 
Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok captured and tried for genocide 
and crimes against humanity. A team of legal experts appointed by 
the United Nations visited Cambodia last month to assess evidence 
for a possible international tribunal. Local U.N. officials said the 
report was due to reach Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a few weeks. 
Om Yentieng said the prime minister supports a tribunal but that justice 
should be left to local courts _ woefully unequipped for such a task. 
Over the past two years, the government has adopted a policy of negotiating 
de facto amnesty with Khmer Rouge leaders to persuade them to end 
nearly two decades of stalemated civil war. Analysts warned Hun Sen 
risks losing support from Cambodians if he prevents a trial for at 
least one of the defectors. ``With Nuon Chea, it is very clear he 
was involved in dealing with security, prisoners and torture,'' said 
Youk Chhang, director of a Cambodian research center devoted to gathering 
evidence against the Khmer Rouge. Still, the strategy has brought 
peace to large areas of Cambodia for the first time in a generation 
but means that none of the group's most bloodstained chieftains has 
been taken into custody. Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea's letters said 
they had sealed their defection by telephone Friday with Hun Sen, 
who formed a new government last month expected to curb the political 
instability long exploited by the Khmer Rouge. In Thailand, which 
closely monitors Khmer Rouge activities, Maj. Gen. Wiwat Sattarak, 
chief of the border task force, said that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea 
moved to defect a month ago. ``Ta Mok remains with a handful of loyalist 
troops willing to die for him. There's no more than 100,'' Wiwat said. 
``The Cambodian government's attitude is to let him grow old and die 
by himself, it's not worth the money to chase him.''
