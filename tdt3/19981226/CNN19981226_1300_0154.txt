There are indications the Monica Lewinsky matter may be brought to 
an end sooner rather than later, as the momentum for censuring President 
Clinton grows. Chris black reports. CNN has learned that two influential 
democratic senators are collaborating on a censure resolution to reprimand 
President Clinton. A Senate source says Daniel Patrick Moynihan of 
New York and Robert Byrd of West Virginia agreed to work together 
on a proposal that could short-circuit a Senate trial. They have a 
combined more than 60 years in the United States Senate. They're the 
old guard. They're seasoned. They're veterans. They've seen it all. 
And they come with a great deal of credibility. And that makes any 
proposal that they offer immediately important. The proposal is one 
of several back channel efforts under way in the Senate aimed at bringing 
a speedy end to the impeachment inquiry. White House officials welcomed 
the development because President Clinton has said he would accept 
censure, but only on the right terms. White House officials had been 
concerned that Moynihan and Byrd might raise constitutional objections 
to any censure proposal. Both lawmakers are strict interpreters of 
the constitution. And some scholars have said that the constitution 
may not allow Congress to censure any president and cut off a Senate 
impeachment trial. Byrd raised the possibility of a censure alternative 
earlier this week, but also told the White House not to interfere 
with Senate deliberations. Moynihan was one of the first democrats 
to criticize the president for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
Moynihan, who is retiring at the end of his term, hinted back in September 
he saw a possible way to deal with the president's scandal. If justice 
is done with sufficient regularity and moderation, the heavens need 
not fall. a Senate source says the two senior lawmakers hope to write 
a Resolution that will pass constitutional Muster and attract republican 
support. For the White House, the Moynihan/Byrd collaboration is one 
more sign of growing momentum for a compromise. Chris black, CNN,
