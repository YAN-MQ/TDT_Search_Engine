In the upcoming science fiction thriller ``The Matrix,'' Keanu Reeves' 
character comes to believe the city in which he lives has been generated 
by evil computers. The backdrop is Australia's largest city: Sydney. 
In the gothic ``Dark City,'' a section of Sydney's oldest district 
forms part of the grim location of the title, where aliens have created 
a metropolis floating in space to conduct bizarre experiments on human 
behavior. In each case, the scene is generic, anonymous: it could 
be anywhere. But the relative anonymity of Sydney, and Australia more 
generally, as a film location may be about to change as a rash of 
new major production facilities and movie deals with big Hollywood 
studios push Australia out of the wings and onto center stage as an 
international filmmaking center. Already known as a source of quirky 
independent films such as the Academy Award-winning ``Shine'' and 
``Strictly Ballroom,'' Australia is increasingly a place where Hollywood 
blockbusters are made. The recent announcement by ``Star Wars'' creator 
George Lucas that the next two chapters in his six-part space epic 
will be made in Australia, each with a budget of around U.S. dlrs 
120 million (Australian dollars 190 million), has confirmed Sydney's 
future as a film-making center. ``This is one of the most competitive 
screen making capitals in the world,'' said Rick McCallum, producer 
of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, during a Sydney visit in November. 
``It's not about the exchange rate, it is about the talent that we 
can get.'' McCallum spent more than 12 months negotiating with executives 
of Fox Studios Australia, a 50-50 joint venture between global media 
magnate Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and property development company 
Lend Lease Corp. The studio, boasting six sound stages and comprehensive 
post production services, is in large part behind the surge in international 
film production in Australia. It officially opened only this year, 
but already the two biggest films made in Australia to date _ the 
Australian dollars 95 million (U.S. dlrs 60 million) ``Matrix'' and 
the Australian dollars 90 million (U.S. dlrs 57 million) sequel to 
the 1996 hit ``Babe'' _ have been made there. In addition, the multimillion-dollar 
television series ``Farscape'' is being made by the Jim Henson Co., 
named after the late ``Muppets'' creator. Negotiations are reportedly 
under way for a sequel to ``Mission: Impossible'' starring Tom Cruise 
and a version of Ray Bradbury's ``Fahrenheit 451'' by Australian-born 
star Mel Gibson. At the Warner Bros. Roadshow Movieworld studio and 
theme park complex in Queensland state, major U.S.-backed movie productions 
have included World War II film ``The Thin Red Line'' starring Sean 
Penn and the Australian dollars 31 million science fiction feature 
``Pitch Black,'' directed by American David Twohy. HBO movies and 
television series are also being produced at the Queensland studios. 
In Victoria state, Viacom Inc., the owner of Paramount Pictures, is 
part of a consortium spending Australian dollars 350 million (U.S. 
dlrs 220 million) on an entertainment complex that will include film 
and television studios. Fox Studios' deal with Lucasfilm Ltd. to produce 
Episodes II and III in the Star Wars trilogy is expected to push production 
film levels in Australia past the record set in financial year 1997-98. 
``Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' the first of the planned prequels, 
was filmed in Britain in 1997 and is due for release in the United 
States in May. Announcing the Fox deal in Sydney, Lucas likened the 
Australian industry now to that of Britain in the 1970s, which was 
significantly boosted when Lucas shifted his production team there 
for the original ``Star Wars.'' ``I could go anywhere in the world 
and shoot and we could use any warehouse for a studio,'' Lucas said. 
``In the end it is the talent that is here. I go where the talent 
is.'' ``We are very keen to help bring in (to Australia) and update 
some of the more esoteric crafts that that are necessary for large 
stage productions and to expand that part of the industry,'' Lucas 
said. The U.S productions overshadow a busy local industry, which 
continues to produce internationally acclaimed independent releases 
despite a declining level of government arts funding. Some 115 Australian 
feature films were selected for screening at international festivals 
in 1997-98, including Cannes, Sundance and the Berlin Film Festivals. 
Thirty-three features won awards, according to the Australian Film 
Commission. ``Babe: Pig in the City'' and ``Matrix,'' a Warner Bros./Village 
Roadshow Pictures collaboration that has opened in U.S. cinemas, pushed 
film and television production values in Australia to an all-time 
high in the financial year to June 30 1998 of Australian dollars 421 
million (U.S. dlrs 265 million). The ``Babe'' sequel, which was counted 
as a local production despite being financed by U.S. company Universal 
Pictures, was chiefly responsible for a record high for local feature 
films of Australian dollars 166 million (U.S. dlrs 105 million), up 
from Australian dollars 130 million (U.S. dlrs 82 million) in 1996-97 
and just Australian dollars 43 million (U.S. dlrs 27 million) three 
years ago, according the annual national production survey of the 
Australian Film Commission.
