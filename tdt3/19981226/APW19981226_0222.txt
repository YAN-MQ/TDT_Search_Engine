The bodies of four foreigners beheaded in Chechnya earlier this month 
were found on the outskirts of the Chechen capital Grozny, a news 
report said Saturday. The bodies of the four men _ Peter Kennedy, 
Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley 
Shaw _ were found late Friday night, said Chechen presidential spokesman 
Mairbek Vachagayev, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. The foreigners' 
heads were found on a roadside Dec. 8, after a rescue attempt by local 
authorities apparently went wrong. The men, all engineers in Chechnya 
to install a cellular phone system, were kidnapped in early October. 
Officials said the bodies would be sent to Britain. Authorities have 
accused a rebel warlord of killing the four men, but have provided 
no evidence to support their claim. The warlord, Arbi Barayev, denies 
the charges. Chechnya has been plagued by violence and kidnappings, 
especially since its 1994-96 independence war against Russia. It runs 
its own affairs though no country recognizes its claims of sovereignty.
