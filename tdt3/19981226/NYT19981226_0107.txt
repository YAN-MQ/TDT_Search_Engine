A hodgepodge of snow will fall at high elevations in the mountains 
of Idaho, western Montana, Utah, western Colorado and northern Nevada 
on Sunday as moist Pacific winds aloft are forced to rapidly rise 
over west-facing slopes. Though there will be no organized storm system, 
this lifting of moist air by the terrain will result in as much as 
a foot of snow on some mountain slopes. Rain will develop later Sunday 
and Sunday night in western Washington as a warm front approaches 
from the Pacific. Rain and wind will intensify, particularly over 
the Olympics and the Coastal Range, where the sloping terrain adds 
lift to invading ocean air. Farther south, a fast-flowing stream of 
moist air 2,000 feet above the ocean will slam into northern California 
and southern Oregon late Sunday, setting the stage for moderate to 
heavy rains. Elevations where mountain snow occurs will steadily rise. 
Meanwhile, cirrus clouds will dim the sun over parts of the Southwest 
as a plume of high-altitude moisture arrives from the tropical Pacific. 
Clouds will gather over the western Gulf States on Sunday as a flow 
of increasingly moist air off the Gulf of Mexico is encouraged by 
a disturbance emerging from the Rockies. Rain will develop late Sunday 
or Sunday night across eastern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana, with 
isolated thunder near the Gulf Coast. Broken areas of generally light 
snow will spread across the upper Great Lakes toward western New York 
as a moisture-starved disturbance streaks eastward along the Canadian 
border. FOCUS: MOUNTAIN GLACIERS Snow advisories were in effect Saturday 
for parts of the Cascades as heavy snow showers were expected to bring 
additional accumulations of 6 to 10 inches. With a parade of Pacific 
storms in winter and recurrent ocean winds continually rising up western 
slopes, snowfalls in the Cascades typically exceed 400 inches each 
year. High snowfalls account for the existence of glaciers in the 
Cascades. A glacier forms where snow can stay long enough to change 
to ice. The amount of ice in mountain glaciers pales in comparison 
to the ice locked over glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica.
