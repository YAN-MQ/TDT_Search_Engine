A Pakistani judicial inquiry is sending two people to Australia this 
week to record the statements of disgraced Australian cricketers Mark 
Waugh and Shane Warne, cricket authorities said Saturday. The Pakistani 
inquiry is investigating allegations made by Waugh, Warne and teammate 
Tim May that top Pakistani cricketers were involved in match fixing. 
However the inquiry says the testimony given by Waugh is suspect following 
admissions by both Waugh and Warne that they took money from an Indian 
bookmaker in exchange for information about pitch and weather during 
a 1994 series. The information affects the odds bookmakers give to 
people betting on the game. Pakistani cricket officials say Waugh 
made a false statement when he appeared before the Pakistani judicial 
inquiry in October. The inquiry is probing allegations that Pakistani 
cricketers Salim Malik and Wasim Akram were involved in match fixing. 
The Pakistani cricketers have denied the allegations.
