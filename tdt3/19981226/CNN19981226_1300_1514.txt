Robin Williams isn't a doctor, but he plays one in his latest big-screen 
role. Bill Tush looks at the Oscar-winner's unique brand of medicine. 
My name is Dr. Phil. I'll be your surgeon. Hunter Adams, nicknamed 
"patch," wants in the worst way to be a Doctor. Too bad the medical 
school faculty doesn't agree with Adams that tickling the funny bone 
could be part of the cure. I want to learn about people, I want to 
help them with their troubles. That's what I do. But you suck at it. 
And no matter what the doctor orders, patch can't stop clowning around. 
Who better to play the real-life patch Adams but Oscar winner Robin 
williams? This may be strange, hard to believe, but he's much more 
outrageous than I am in many ways. He -- just even in terms of clothing, 
he makes me look amish. He is a clown, a registered -- I don't know 
if he's a registered clown. Call this number -- national clown union. 
"I'll tell you something --" some guy calls in your door, "were you 
clowning without a union card?" Hard to imagine anyone being more 
outrageous than Robin Williams, especially when the cameras are rolling 
and he gets to shtick it up. Donner, party of 50. Somebody has got 
to exercise some control, and that's where "Patch's" director, Tom 
shadyac, comes in. A lot of the comedy in this film was improvised 
by Robin. I mean, we had a wonderful script from Steve odekur. And 
he would always get us to a certain place, but Robin would take it 
and then run from there. And that has to be a laugh riot for Williams' 
co-stars. or is it? He would just go off on tangents, and we would 
all just sort of go, "okay." He did his thing. No, and it was fantastic, 
because everyone would laugh. That's Monica Potter, who places patch's 
fellow medical student and eventual love interest. Now here is where 
the film's poetic license comes in. It's actually a man in real life, 
though. Really. Are you serious? The real person was a man who is 
a good friend of patch Adams. But patch, remember, is real, wacky, 
and a lot taller than the man who plays him. He looks like a combination 
between Salvador Dali and emmett Kelly. He's very -- has long, long 
hair. He's about 6', 2", big handlebar moustache. And just like the 
man he plays, Robin Williams believes laughter is the best medicine. 
The hospital will cover all of your bills. Any other questions? Bill 
Tush, "CNN Entertainment News," New York.
