Good evening. It's going to be another dark and uncomfortable night 
in the southeast. Hundreds of thousands still without power from a 
Christmas eve ice storm. Repair crews are working nonstop but the 
power companies say it could be midweek before everyone has power 
again. ABC's Mike Von Fremd has more. The cold snap was brief, the 
snowfall minimal, buthe damage is long lasting and significant. Across 
much of the south, it was candlelight Christmas out of necessity. 
Icy power lines left 400,000 families without power. It was about 
44 degrees in the house this morning. That's pretty cold. Yeah, getting 
a little bit too cold to stay here. Virginia was the state hardest 
hit. 200,000 people lost power, but most of it has now been restored. 
It is a thin but deadly layer of ice that remains on many roads. Nationwide, 
30 deaths have been blamed on the freezing conditions. In central 
California, the problem is crop damage. The temperature today is back 
up in the 60s, but the damage from the freeze three days ago is done. 
More than 80% of the United States' edible orange crop is grown here 
and farmers fear that the hard freeze has wiped it out. This orange 
is starting to thaw out a little bit, but it kind of has this water 
soaked look. Also damaged is the lemon and broccoli crop. California 
farmers are obviously suffering now. Consumers could begin to see 
prices rise in the next few days. Mike Von Fremd, ABC News, Washington.
