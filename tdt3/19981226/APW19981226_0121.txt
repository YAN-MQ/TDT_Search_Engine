MARJAYOUN, Lebanon AP) - A security officer of the Israeli-allied 
South Lebanon Army militia was found dead of gunshot wounds Saturday 
in the village of Chebaa, Lebanese security officials said. The body 
of Ghassan Daher was found in the early morning shortly after a shootout 
in the village in the western Bekaa valley, said the officials, speaking 
on the customary condition of anonymity. It could not be determined 
whether Daher's killing resulted from a personal vendetta or a political 
assassination, the officials said. Chebaa is on the slopes of Mount 
Hermon in the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon, which is patrolled 
by some 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen. 
It is a center for smuggling contraband goods between Lebanon, Israel 
and Syria. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed guerrilla group whose fighters 
are active in the region, often target collaborators with Israel. 
A Hezbollah official in Beirut said the group had no comment on Daher's 
killing.
