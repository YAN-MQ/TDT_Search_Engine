Like many, George Saurwein rarely attended regular religious services, 
except at this time of year. ``You could say I was one of those Christmas-and-Easter 
Christians,'' said Saurwein, 36, helping himself to a cup of coffee 
in the parish hall of St. James Episcopal Church here. ``I had a relationship 
with God that was outside the church.'' That was until this fall, 
when Saurwein's brother-in-law talked him into going to an Alpha course, 
a novel approach to Christian education that has been catching on 
nationwide in a growing number of Episcopal congregations, as well 
as those of other mainstream Christian denominations. ``Alpha got 
me closer to people in the church and made me feel like a part of 
the community,'' said Saurwein, who now attends services at St. James 
every Sunday. And while the rector, the Rev. Roger Robillard, is pleased 
to see Saurwein and other Alpha graduates fill the pews each week, 
he said he was not keeping score. ``Alpha's not an instrument for 
growing my church only, but for growing the church as a whole,'' Robillard 
said. Alpha's objectives are to introduce newcomers to the Christian 
faith and to re-establish ties with wayward parishioners through a 
10-week videotaped crash course in the basics of Christianity. Promising 
to provide a setting in which participants are not threatened or judged, 
the course features a series of lectures by the Rev. Nicky Gumbel, 
43, an Oxford-educated lawyer turned minister who is on the staff 
of the Holy Trinity Anglican Church of Brompton in London. It was 
there that Alpha was conceived in the mid-1970s as a Bible study course 
for new Christians. A former atheist who once wrote a school essay 
to disprove the existence of God and eventually turned to Christianity 
after reading the New Testament, Gumbel took charge of the Alpha program 
in 1991 and revised it, making the course accessible to a wider audience. 
``It's an attempt to keep the message a traditional one, but change 
the packaging, to present Christianity in a way that's culturally 
relevant to people today,'' said Alistair Hanna, 53, executive director 
of Alpha North America, which is based at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal 
Church in New York and is the base for the Alpha movement in the United 
States and Canada. Through a combination of humorous anecdotes, personal 
reflections and passages from many theological sources _ from the 
Scriptures to C.S. Lewis to Charlie Brown _ Gumbel addresses questions 
like, ``Why does God allow suffering?'' ``Why and how do I pray?'' 
and ``Is Christianity boring, untrue and irrelevant?'' ``It really 
is for intelligent seekers who don't yet belong to a church,'' said 
the Rev. Jeffrey Black, who used the course to attract all 250 members 
of his year-old congregation at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Austin, 
Texas. Each Alpha session begins with a potluck supper, followed by 
a viewing of a videotape and then a discussion moderated by a local 
Alpha leader, typically a parish member or sometimes the church minister. 
Although Alpha is most popular among Episcopalians, it is intended 
to be cross-denominational and has attracted Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, 
Baptists, Methodists and others. ``There are many barriers being broken 
down between denominations these days, so Alpha fits in well,'' said 
the Rev. Larry Showalter, pastor of Boston's Ruggles Baptist Church, 
where the Alpha course has been offered for a little more than a year. 
Showalter said Alpha was directly responsible for a 5 percent to 10 
percent increase in membership at his congregation. ``Alpha draws 
in people who are on the fringe as well as those who are `unchurched' 
and are just looking to understand the Christian faith,'' Showalter 
said. Since Alpha was introduced in the United States in 1995, nearly 
2,000 churches have offered the course. Sales of Alpha course materials 
in the United States are brisk: 170,000 Alpha manuals and 4,000 sets 
of videos in the last two years, Alpha officials said. Alpha officials 
estimate that more than 1.5 million people worldwide have taken the 
course, which is offered in 75 countries. ``We can't keep enough in 
the warehouse,'' said Carrie Salstrom, marketing manager for David 
C. Cook Church Ministries in Colorado Springs, the publisher of Alpha 
tapes and literature and the nation's largest nondenominational publisher 
of Sunday school materials. Ms. Salstrom said Alpha materials had 
become ``one of the company's largest lines'' over the last three 
years. Alpha's ready explanations on issues of faith and its no-pressure 
approach account for much of its success, said James Wind, president 
of Alban Institute in Bethesda, Md., an independent organization that 
tracks trends in congregations nationwide. ``It's presented in a way 
that people who are constantly being marketed to can relate to,'' 
Wind said. Although he said he supported any ``new and creative way 
to invite people into the faith,'' including Alpha, he wondered whether 
the course delved deeply enough. ``Are the ambiguities and deeper 
puzzles and paradoxes of the Christian faith being represented here?'' 
he said. ``I'm not sure.'' Other skeptics have picked up Alpha and 
put it down for the same reason. ``It's packaged well and is attractive, 
but the study of Christianity is not as simple as Gumbel makes it 
out to be,'' said Chester Gillis, associate professor of theology 
at Georgetown University and author of ``Roman Catholicism in America,'' 
which is to be issued in July by Columbia University Press. ``He makes 
the claims of Christianity seem so historically certain that he leaves 
little need for faith.'' Then there are those who bridle at Alpha's 
hard-line stance against divorce, abortion and homosexuality. Some 
ministers chose to ignore the program's position on the last issue, 
and edited it from their presentations. Still others question whether 
or not Alpha, owing to its conservative roots, is as ecumenical in 
its appeal as its literature claims. ``I'm not convinced that it's 
bringing in a whole lot of new people,'' said the Rev. Ian Douglas, 
a theologian at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass. 
``Unfortunately, I think that most of the people who have participated 
are like-minded conservatives looking for more fellowship and to have 
their theological positions affirmed.'' Nevertheless, Alpha has won 
the support of many religious leaders both here and abroad, including 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. George Carey; the televangelist 
Robert Schuller and William Cardinal Keeler of Baltimore. Hanna, Alpha's 
top American official, says his goal is to offer the program in 50,000 
churches in the United States and attract 8 million to 10 million 
new people to the program. His plan: get an invitation to an Alpha 
course into the mailboxes of every home in the United States by the 
end of 2000. ``If you walked through any 18th-century village here 
or in Europe, the biggest, noisiest building was always the church, 
with its bell and its clock,'' Hanna said. ``Today, I think the church 
has shrunk in terms of its visibility. I think Alpha's a good way 
to raise the noise level again.''
