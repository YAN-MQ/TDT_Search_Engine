When he first saw them last year, the newly arrived Pepper Johnson 
thought: ``One and 15? What a bunch of misfits.'' Johnson, the veteran 
linebacker who was part of Bill Parcells' ongoing overhaul of the 
Jets, was looking at the holdovers, the players who had been around 
during the dismal 1-15 season the year before. Chad Cascadden, who 
joined the Jets in 1995 _ when they went 3-13 _ was one of those misfits. 
``When you go 3-13, and then 1-15, right out of college, it makes 
you wonder: Is this what NFL life is all about?'' Cascadden said. 
``For me, it was a relief when the season was over and I could go 
home and lick my wounds.'' This season, Cascadden won't be going home 
so soon. And no matter how the playoff-bound, 11-4, division champion 
Jets do Sunday against New England in their final regular-season game, 
they will have completed a remarkable turnaround, one unparalleled 
in National Football League history. Much of the credit for that has 
gone to Parcells and to the new coaches and players he brought in. 
But there remains a core of players from the low point in Jets history, 
and they are proud of what they have accomplished. In an upbeat Jets 
locker room the day before Christmas, the rookie tackle Jason Fabini 
turned to tackle Jumbo Elliott, one of 18 Jets on the current roster 
who remain from the 1996 team. The youngster was asking the veteran 
about the old days. ``You here when the team was 1-15, Jumbo?'' ``Yes, 
I was,'' replied Elliott. ``You played the whole year?'' ``I missed 
two games,'' said Elliott. ``But I played.'' These days, that 1-15 
record can be seen as a badge, rather than a scarlet number of shame. 
Asked what it was about the 18 players that has kept them on the team 
amid all the changes, Parcells said: ``Any time there's a new overhaul, 
it can work a couple of different ways. It can serve to rejuvenate 
and refresh people who felt they were in a negative situation. I don't 
mean the team or the organization, but themselves. It can serve also 
to force a recommitment by everyone, even the ones that were established, 
to proving themselves again.'' Parcells added: ``It's the oldie _ 
you're part of the problem or part of the solution. When you're a 
coach coming in, you don't know which it is; a guy who hasn't played 
much could be part of the solution. The most common thing about the 
group that's left is the majority of them are pretty good people.'' 
Quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who joined the club this year, said: 
``They're all good guys. There isn't one of them I wouldn't take home 
to meet my family.'' Some of them were pretty good players, too. Three 
players from that season made it to this year's Pro Bowl: linebacker 
Mo Lewis, cornerback Aaron Glenn and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. 
There was some talent there. Which makes it that much harder to believe 
how bad things were two season ago. When tight end Kyle Brady used 
to walk through the doors at Weeb Ewbank Hall and enter the locker 
room, ``it was as if a cloud was hanging over the place,'' he said. 
Elliott used to wear his Super Bowl ring a lot more often in those 
days. ``It made me think of better times,'' he said. It was only 24 
months ago. The word laughingstock was applied freely, and why not? 
The Jets were the worst team in the league, at least by their record. 
They were the worst team in franchise history. That season evoked 
in Don Maynard, one of two Hall of Fame players who made it to Canton 
based on a Jets career, a longing to bring back the old days. He was 
embarrassed, as were all the members of the Super Bowl III champions, 
for what the Jets had turned into. So Maynard wrote to the owner Leon 
Hess and offered himself up as the new head coach. He would bring 
with him teammates from that 1968 season as assistant coaches. Instead, 
Hess and the team president, Steve Gutman, figured out how to get 
Parcells, whose disenchantment with the Patriots' front office was 
complete. From 1-15 under Rich Kotite, the Jets went to 9-7 last year, 
and then to this year, the one that Testaverde calls the magical season. 
When Parcells arrived, he said, he understood that coaches ``all basically 
say the same thing _ work hard and win.'' ``But you have to give the 
players some evidence you're committed to winning,'' he said. ``You've 
got to do everything toward winning and you've got to do it all the 
time. It's not a once-in-a-while thing. Not everyone is willing to 
do it _ not coaches, not players.'' What do the survivors believe 
has kept them around? To Glenn Foley, who is one of them, a common 
denominator is ``smarts.'' Brady said: ``One thing Bill requires of 
you is a commitment. In the off season he put up signs: `Blame nobody, 
expect nothing, do something' and `Dumb players do dumb things. Smart 
players do smart things.' The guys he brought in that he had coached 
before, they knew these things. We had to learn it.'' Richie Anderson, 
the running back, knew that as a holdover, ``I had to show him I had 
the qualities he was looking for, especially coming from a team that 
was 1-15.'' Players had to be tough to endure some of the indignities 
of the 1996 season. It is hard to believe, or even remember, in this 
season in which six of seven home crowds have topped 70,000 fans, 
that in one game alone the Jets had a record 55,000 no-shows that 
season. The 1-15 record happened despite the club's $70 million commitment 
in long-term contracts during the previous off season, the greatest 
such splurge in league history. They had to pay that much money for 
the free agents because, as one player's lawyer put it, ``No one wants 
to come to the Jets.'' Elliott recalled that not all players held 
up equally well under the strain of that season. ``You know what got 
me annoyed?'' he asked. ``Up until the last five games of the season 
back then, we worked pretty hard. Then there were slackers who took 
advantage of things.'' Foley, who was the starting quarterback the 
last three games of that season after Neil O'Donnell popped a hamstring 
while warming up, said: ``What did I learn? You have to be strong. 
It's not easy to lead a squad under those circumstances. It can never 
get worse, never get tougher than to lead a team when you're 1-12 
and there's nothing to play for and you have pride in your profession. 
Down the stretch, some guys didn't want to play.'' To Ray Mickens, 
then a rookie cornerback from Texas A&AMP;M, the idea of losing was 
something new. Now he appreciates victories. ``You take winning for 
granted when you come from a winning program,'' he said. ``At A&AMP;M 
my team was 9-3, and that was my worst year. I lost five games in 
four years in college. I remember it used to be so easy. Now I don't 
take it for granted.'' Elliott concluded: ``The good thing about football 
is that it teaches you not to dwell.'' For Keyshawn Johnson, who was 
a rookie that year and wrote a book about the season, there was never 
any doubt about himself. ``I knew it was only going to get better,'' 
he said. ``I'm the same person I always was. I thought of myself as 
the president.'' Johnson chuckled as he contemplated some of the negative 
comments he made in the book about other players. ``Those people I 
learned about, and wrote about,'' he said, ``are no longer around 
right now.''
