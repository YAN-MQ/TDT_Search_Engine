After fighting the flu and making hours of Christmas appearances, 
Pope John paul II is ready for a break. Today, he began a brief holiday 
at a Lakeside town southeast of Rome. He celebrated a lengthy midnight 
mass Christmas eve, followed by an address at St. Peter's square at 
noon the next day. Reports say he's rested and in good spirits.
