A resurgence of violence in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province is threatening 
a Shaky 2-month-old cease-fire. And international observers are struggling 
to find ways to help keep the peace. Eric olander has the story. Christmas 
day brought anything but peace in the Kosovo province. A second day 
of fighting erupted between ethnic Albanian rebels and Serbian forces. 
Serbian police say they came under fire Friday near a rebel stronghold 
in northern Kosovo. The Serb officials were forced to take cover just 
outside lapastica. A rebel commander demanded the Serbs retreat to 
previous positions. But the Serb officials said they were there to 
find those responsible for killing a police officer during clashes 
Monday in podujevo. The only reason for a Serbian police presence 
in this area is to pursue for killer or killers of the Serb police 
officer. When our forces came, the rebels opened fire from everywhere 
and we had to respond in the same way. United States envoy William 
Walker says this is the most tense period in the region since an October 
cease-fire was signed. Walker is the head of the Kosovo verification 
mission, or kvm. I'm trying to see what the situation is, number one, 
and to see if there is anything we at kvm can do to make the situation 
get better -- less tense, less hostile. And I'm sure the government 
will not understand my being here, but nevertheless I am here to see 
if we can convince both sides that this isn't a way to settle their 
differences. Even if the violence continues, Walker says the international 
observers will stay in the region. He says their presence may be "the 
last best chance for the Kosovo problem to be solved without force."
