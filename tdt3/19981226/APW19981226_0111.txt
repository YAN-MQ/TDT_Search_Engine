India's vast subcontinent, now torn by struggles between Hindus and 
Muslims, once had a ruler who used Christian ideas and Christian art 
to strengthen his rule over his hostile subjects. Christian art and 
its influence in India lasted much longer than the ruler's policies. 
The rarely-told story goes back more than 400 years. It's on view 
in an unusual show at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, part of the Smithsonian 
Institution, called ``The Jesuits and the Grand Mogul.'' The key to 
the Christian influence traces back to a politically important relationship 
with Portugal. Mongolian heirs of Genghis Khan had swept down from 
Afghanistan and conquered much of what is now India and Pakistan. 
Europeans of the time called them moguls _ another form of ``mongol'' 
_ and ``Grand Mogul'' became the term for a wealthy, dictatorial ruler. 
Probably the grandest of the moguls was Jalal ud-Din Mohammed, known 
as Akbar, who ruled in the time of the first Queen Elizabeth. The 
English had less to do with India at the time than the Portuguese, 
who ran an important colony on the Indian coast at Goa. Through Goa, 
Jesuit missionaries from Rome were royally welcomed to Akbar's court, 
bringing western artists with them. When European travelers like the 
Englishman Sir Thomas Roe came into the palaces of the Mogul emperors, 
they were astonished to find the walls covered by Italian Renaissance-style 
murals with Christ, the Madonna and Christian saints, said Gauvin 
Bailey, curator of the exhibit. Bailey estimated that a third of Akbar's 
painters _ he had about 100 _ did Christian scenes, though many of 
them remained Hindus. A more sedate painting now at the Chester Beatty 
Library in Dublin puts the theologians on their knees before the enthroned, 
mustachioed emperor, who is attended by a servant with a fly-whisk. 
As a Muslim conqueror ruling tens of millions of Hindus, Akbar had 
political problems. He tried setting up a religion of his own, combining 
several faiths. Some Muslims said he had abandoned Islam; some Christians 
thought he was about to be converted. Both proved wrong. One good 
reason Akbar kept on good terms with the Portuguese was that he needed 
their warships to protect Muslim pilgrims on their way to Mecca, a 
rite that is required of every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it. 
Akbar had no navy of his own. Milo C. Beach, head of the gallery and 
an authority on the period, called Akbar's policy highly successful, 
at least in the short run. ``He brought everybody in,'' Beach said. 
``The Christians weren't an important political element domestically, 
but it was important for trade to know how the Portuguese worked.'' 
Akbar's son Jahangir carried on the policy. But Christian saints gradually 
disappeared from court painting under Akbar's grandson Shah Jahan, 
a more traditional Muslim, though they lingered on in folk art. At 
Agra, Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal, sometimes called the world's 
most beautiful building. Bailey said that although claims that an 
Italian architect created the Taj are untrue, the structure still 
shows western influence: an Italian technique for encrusting jewels 
in stone, flower designs carved from Dutch models. The western influences 
stayed until British conquerors dethroned the last Mogul 150 years 
ago. The Portuguese held on to Goa until 1961. Madonnas, saints and 
cherubs are prominent in the paintings at the Sackler show. It will 
be on view through April 4, 1999.
