While the full effect of last week's air assault is not known, ABC's 
Ron claiborne finds one result is deepening anger over the continuing 
U.N. economic sanctions. Hossam El-ashmawy, chef of the Baghdad tennis 
club, remembers the good old days very well. After all, that was only 
eight years ago, before the economic embargo. You miss the cheese, 
you miss the butter, real butter. You miss the herbs. So many things 
I do miss, yes. This private club once symbolized affluence in a country 
that used to have a thriving, oil-rich economy. But after Saddam Hussein 
invaded Kuwait and triggered the gulf war, the United Nations banned 
most international trade with Iraq. The economy is now in tatters. 
Few people have jobs, and there are chronic shortages of food and 
medicine. The sanctions were supposed to undermine Saddam Hussein, 
but he is still in power, while most of Iraq's 22 million people suffer. 
They are people like warda yalla, a refugee from northern Iraq, and 
mother of seven. She's a Christian, but she says, this Christmas, 
there was nothing to celebrate. "Christmas before the war was better," 
she said. We weren't scared. Food, everything was available. Now there's 
nothing." While all interviews here are conducted in the presence 
of official government representatives, many people here, like adnan 
Hussein, seem genuinely outraged by last week's bombings. Hussein 
used to import car and drill parts from abroad, until the embargo. 
Now he's forced to make copies by hand. But few of his customers have 
money, he struggles to make ends meet. "I sold my TV, I sold my refrigerator. 
I sold my oven," he said. "I had to, but still I can't keep up. And 
this is not the end of it. It's only going to get worse." Hussein 
blames the U.S. and the embargo for his, and Iraq's, troubles. Once, 
it was his wish to someday visit America. Now, he says, America is 
his enemy. Ron Claiborne, ABC News, Baghdad.
