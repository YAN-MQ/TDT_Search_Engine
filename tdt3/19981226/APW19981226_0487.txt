Iraq said Saturday that its anti-aircraft gunners drove off an attack 
by ``enemy'' warplanes that flew in from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify the nationality of 
the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' to describe warplanes 
from the United States and Britain. The United States has aircraft 
in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Britain also bases aircraft in Kuwait. 
In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley 
said U.S. aircraft flew over Iraq on Saturday, but ``they reported 
no incidents of fire directed against them.'' He said, however, that 
``one aircraft reported anti-aircraft fire well off in the distance, 
but it was not directed at them.'' There were no incidents against 
British or French aircraft, he said. The two European powers and the 
United States maintain a ``no-fly zone'' over southern Iraq that was 
set up in 1992 to halt air attacks against Shiite Muslim rebels. State-controlled 
Iraqi media have issued almost daily reports of violations of the 
country's airspace since the United States and Britain ended four 
days of airstrikes against Iraq on Dec. 19. The strikes were carried 
out after U.N. weapons inspectors released a report saying that Baghdad 
was blocking their work. Iraq says that 62 soldiers and more than 
40 civilians were killed in the bombardment. The increased reports 
of airspace violations and the Saturday incident may be an indication 
that Baghdad intends to challenge the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. 
Iraq has never recognize the zone and has occasionally confronted 
aircraft flying in the area. The last major incident in the zone was 
in June. A U.S. F-16 warplane fired a missile at an anti-aircraft 
site after Iraqi radar targeted British warplanes patrolling the zone. 
Iraq denied that its forces threatened the British aircraft. The Iraqi 
News Agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT) Saturday a formation 
of warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense sites, which confronted 
it and forced it to drop its load randomly.'' The report did not say 
where the apparent attack took place and gave no other details. Also 
Saturday, the Babil newspaper criticized Iraq's most powerful sympathizers 
on the U.N. Security Council _ France, Russia and China _ for not 
taking stronger action toward easing U.N. sanctions against Iraq. 
The newspaper, which is owned by a son of President Saddam Hussein, 
said that Russia's and China's positions ``did not accomplish any 
positive results for Iraq.'' It added that the ``fluctuation of the 
French stand has made us wonder if they are with us or against us.'' 
Security Council diplomats have said the sweeping sanctions _ imposed 
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 _ will not be lifted until U.N. 
inspectors certify that Iraq has dismantled its programs to build 
weapons of mass destruction. France, Russia and China, along with 
the United States and Britain, are permanent members of the Security 
Council.
