A warehouse that is used to distribute copies of The New York Times 
was robbed Saturday afternoon by two armed men who made off with $5,000 
in cash and a delivery truck after tying up and gagging five people, 
the police said. The two men, one armed with a shotgun and the other 
with a handgun, entered the warehouse, located on Pier 40 near West 
Houston and West Streets, shortly before 3:30 p.m. They held five 
people, four employees of The Times and a security guard, at gunpoint, 
said Detective Joseph M. Pentangelo, a Police Department spokesman. 
The men bound and gagged the victims and stole $5,000 in cash, he 
said. The two men then escaped in the Times' delivery truck, Pentangelo 
said. The truck was recovered by a transit police officer at the corner 
of Hudson and Vestry Streets an hour later. Pentangelo said that the 
robbers fled on foot from there and that no arrests had been made. 
Two employees of The Times suffered minor injuries during the robbery 
but refused medical attention, said Lisa Carparelli, a spokeswoman 
for The Times. There were no delays in delivering the sections of 
Saturday's paper that were being distributed from the warehouse when 
the robbery occurred, Mrs. Carparelli said.
