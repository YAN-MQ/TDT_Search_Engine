This year's re-enactment of general George Washington's historic crossing 
of the Delaware river didn't go off as planned. Instead of crossing 
in boats, as the continental army did in 1776, the participants walked 
across a bridge. Because of a drought, there's not enough water in 
the river for the boats. Washington's crossing allowed a successful 
surprise attack on hessian troops in Trenton, New Jersey, that proved 
to be a major victory for the americans.
