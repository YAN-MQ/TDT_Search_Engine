At the Asian games in Bangkok, Thailand, one event has been getting 
the fans and the competitors on their feet. Now, Olympics officials 
are trying to figure out if it really is a sport. John raedler explains. 
Is this strictly ballroom or strictly sport? In the Asian games, it's 
strictly both. "Dancesport," as they call it, is a demanding sequence 
of ballroom dancing. And as a demonstration sport, it's been a big 
hit at these Asian games, playing to shoulder-room-only audiences. 
But is it really sport? The Asian dancesport federation president 
has no doubt. I believe this is the best sport in my life that I ever 
seen before. And he quotes German research to back his opinion. One 
song for quickstep is burning calorie more than the running athletes 
for 500 meters. Chang Ko ping and her partner are dancesport exponents 
from taiwan. And with silk smooth glide and grace, they waltzed their 
way to the gold medal in Bangkok. But Chang has a bigger dream. Would 
you like to dance in the Olympics one day? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Olympic 
officials observed the dancesport demonstration at the asian games. 
And it was such a spectacle and such a crowd pleaser that supporters 
are hoping the waltz and the quickstep could be in the Olympic games 
as soon as 2008. John raedler, CNN, Bangkok.
