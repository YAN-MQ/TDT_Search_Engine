Hundreds of refugees fleeing renewed fighting in northern Kosovo congregated 
Saturday in a regional ethnic Albanian guerrilla stronghold, crowding 
into houses by the dozens to escape bitterly cold weather. Most of 
the refugees in the area west of Podujevo made their way to Lapastica, 
a village still held by the Kosovo Liberation Army after a two-day 
crackdown by Serb police and Yugoslav army units. A Serb farmer was 
killed west of Podujevo by the guerrillas on Saturday, said members 
of the Organization of Security and Cooperation team monitoring Kosovo 
developments. Albanian sources reported a police attack in the same 
region. Otherwise, the province was reported calm in the wake of two 
days of fierce fighting in the Podujevo area that threatened to unravel 
an already shaky de-facto truce reached Oct. 12. Several villages 
in the region were destroyed and abandoned by inhabitants who often 
fled on foot to find shelter elsewhere in temperatures that plummeted 
to -20 C. ( -4 F.) overnight. In a typical scene in Lapastica, one 
room of 20 square meters (24 square yards) housed more than 60 refugees. 
``It's a shame that we have to beg for food and beds,'' said one of 
the refugees, who asked for anonymity. His 7-year-old son Agron couldn't 
speak a word, his teeth chattering after hours on the march in the 
cold. The only warm member of the family of four appeared to be the 
youngest _ a 3-month old girl bundled in wool and asleep in a wooden 
cradle carried by her father. Others in and near Lapastica combed 
the surroundings in the winter sun for firewood as they looked ahead 
to another freezing night.
