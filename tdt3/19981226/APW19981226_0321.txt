Stepping into Germany's debate over whether to build a national Holocaust 
Memorial, famed Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal said he believes a stone 
monument is not the right way to remember the murder of 6 million 
Jews. ``The Holocaust has too many faces for a memorial,'' he said 
in an interview to be published Sunday in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. 
``In any case, remembrance is not only about the dead, but above all 
with the life that was destroyed. Therefore I'm also against a Holocaust 
memorial in Berlin.'' For the past decade, Germany has been debating 
building a Holocaust memorial on a giant plot of government-donated 
land in the heart of Berlin. Construction was supposed to begin next 
year, when the federal government starts its move from Bonn back to 
its historic capital. But the defeat of project backer Helmut Kohl 
by skeptic Gerhard Schroeder in September's elections has thrown the 
memorial into doubt. The new chancellor, Schroeder, wants to let parliament 
decide how to proceed next year. This month, his new culture chief, 
Michael Naumann, proposed scrapping plans for a massive monument in 
favor of a Holocaust museum, research center and memorial garden. 
Schroeder has praised Naumann's idea as more educational, but some 
German Jewish have criticized it as not powerful enough and as an 
excuse not to have a memorial. The chairman of the Central Council 
of Jews in Germany, Ignatz Bubis, notes that Germany already has museums 
in former concentration camps and a documentation center at the site 
of the former SS and Gestapo headquarters in Berlin. ``You can either 
build the memorial or don't build it, but one shouldn't hide behind 
a museum,'' he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, a Munich-based newspaper, 
in a weekend interview. But one of Germany's best-known writers, Stefan 
Heym, spoke out against a memorial in an interview in the new Der 
Spiegel newsmagazine. Referring to the leading design, a cemetery-like 
field of about 2,500 stone pillars, Heym said building it would ``create 
a giant installation for dogs, who'll poop there.'' Heym, a Jew who 
fled the Nazis in 1933 and joined the U.S. Army, suggested instead 
building a school ``where history can be taught.'' Wiesenthal, a Nazi 
death camp survivor who leads the Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna, 
Austria, did not make a specific proposal. ``That's a matter of feeling,'' 
he said. ``In any case nothing out of stone. Jewish memorials were 
never out of stone or wood or iron. They were out of paper. Our memorials 
are books, for example. Not for nothing are we called the people of 
books.''
