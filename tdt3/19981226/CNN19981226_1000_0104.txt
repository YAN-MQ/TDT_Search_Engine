You may soon be paying more for fresh oranges. Freezing temperatures 
across California's central valley this week have destroyed about 
75% of the state's orange crop. Hardest hit is Fresno county, which 
issued a disaster declaration yesterday. Total losses for oranges, 
lemons and tangerines are estimated at nearly $600 million. California 
produces about 80% of the nation's whole oranges.
