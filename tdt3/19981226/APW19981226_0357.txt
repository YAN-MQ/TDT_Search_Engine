The minority National Democratic Party will not contest the elections 
expected in early 1999, the party's leader and sole member of Parliament 
announced Saturday. In explaining his decision not to run, party leader 
Dr. Richie Haynes cited a lack of resources and an inability to gain 
additional seats or significantly affect the outcome of the vote. 
The party, formed in 1989 by members disaffected with the Democratic 
Labor Party, ``was not formed just to be another power-seeking election 
machine, but as a party devoted to the development and promotion of 
values,'' Haynes said. ``This has been a very difficult decision, 
but the only realistic one,'' he said. Prime Minister Owen Arthur 
of the ruling Barbados Labor Party is expected to announce the date 
for the election within days. Most politicians in Barbados expect 
elections will come in the first months of 1999. Arthur's party holds 
18 seats in Parliament while the opposition Democratic Labor Party 
holds nine and Haynes holds the remaining seat. Polls indicate Arthur 
will win another term, and Haynes concurred. ``It is clear the people 
of Barbados will give strong support to the present government,'' 
he said. University of the West Indies political science professor 
Neville Duncan said Haynes' party did not have a credible shot at 
becoming the main opposition party and was wise not to spend limited 
resources on the election. ``It was a sensible decision by Dr. Haynes 
and the NDP, given the state of political play in Barbados today,'' 
said Duncan. Haynes was finance minister for the Democratic party 
in the 1980s but broke away to form his own party in 1989.
