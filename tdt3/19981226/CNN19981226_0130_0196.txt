Iraqi Christians renewed their faith at Christmas day mass and prayed 
for strength in these trying times. Christmas dawned on a city still 
on alert after the past week's attacks. Just after midnight, an air 
raid warning sounded over Baghdad. Half an hour later, the all-clear 
siren. There was no explanation given. President Saddam Hussein on 
Thursday was shown consulting with his leadership on the continuing 
crisis. Baghdad is refusing demands to let U.N. weapons inspectors 
return. And it's telling its people Iraq is in danger of being attacked 
again by what it calls a U.S./British criminal aggression. Iraq has 
complained that enemy aircraft are violating its airspace. It showed 
reporters these missile fragments in southern Iraq it said were fired 
after the airstrikes ended. The U.S. and Britain deny that charge. 
Officials say the country is still in a state of emergency even as 
it picks up the pieces after the four-day attack. Of course there 
are many hundreds of casualties. Iraqi officials aren't calling for 
vengeance, but some on the street believe those responsible for the 
attack should pay. We have nothing against innocent Americans. Those 
working or studying abroad, they are innocent. But their politicians 
and soldiers, if we could reach them, we will try to hurt them. Repairs 
continued through the week -- like at this girls' school damaged by 
shock waves from a missile which struck across the tigris river. Principal, 
genette gerjis Frances, says no one was hurt, but the windows were 
shattered and the ceilings and floor damaged. Of course it will be 
repaired. And they always -- they damage and we rebuild our country. 
I told you, were are very strong people. After the tense night, most 
Iraqis set out to enjoy the day. After all it was Christmas. Jane 
arraf, CNN, Baghdad.
