The Vietnam war is still claiming lives, years after its end. Vietnam's 
"people" newspaper reports four people were killed this week when 
an artillery shell blew up as they were trying to remove its explosive 
charge. Similar casualties are reported virtually every week. Many 
villagers risk their lives to collect scrap metal or explosives left 
over from the war.
