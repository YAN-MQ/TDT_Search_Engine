Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi has told members of her 
party that she won't allow Myanmar's military regime to deport her. 
The opposition National League for Democracy said in a statement obtained 
Saturday that Suu Kyi told members last week not to worry about rumors 
that she would be deported after the New Year. ``Party members should 
not be worried of my deportation,'' Suu Kyi said. ``I am not a citizen 
of other countries and I have no intention of leaving this country.'' 
Suu Kyi is married to a British academic, Michael Aris. The government 
often refers to her a spy and puppet of foreign nations, particularly 
former colonial ruler Britain and the United States. ``I am not a 
British citizen and my conscience is clear,'' said Suu Kyi. ``How 
can a government deport its citizen if there is no country to accept 
him or her?'' Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, has 
spent most of the past decade under house arrest or had her movements 
restricted in a struggle with the military rulers for more democracy. 
Though she was under house arrest at the time, her party won parliamentary 
elections allowed by the military in 1990. The ruling council of generals 
never allowed the parliament to meet. The party launched a campaign 
earlier this year to convene the parliament unilaterally, triggering 
a roundup of hundreds of members. Only those promising to quit her 
party have been freed. Recently, the ruling State Peace and Development 
Council has been organizing mass rallies demanding Suu Kyi be deported, 
echoed by commentaries in official newspapers.
