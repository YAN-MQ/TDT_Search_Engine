For some Americans, Christmas day was a mix of celebration and weather-related 
challenges. Hundreds of people gathered for the traditional Christmas 
service at St. patrick's Cathedral in New York. With snow from an 
earlier storm still on the ground, New Yorkers are experiencing their 
first white Christmas in more than 20 years. Snow would have been 
welcome in the mid-atlantic, where an ice storm has wreaked havoc. 
Virginia power says it has sent a thousand workers to restring power 
lines brought down by ice. At its peak, more than 250,000 customers 
were without power. Retailers are reporting a run on kerosene heaters, 
generators and firewood. We'll have more in the extended weather forecast 
at eight minutes past the hour.
