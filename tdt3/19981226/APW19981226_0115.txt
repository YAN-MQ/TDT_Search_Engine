An estimated 10,000 Somalis have crossed into Ethiopia to escape severe 
drought that has hit southern Somalia, a regional official has said. 
Abubakar Abdi, head of the Region 5 Disaster Prevention and Preparedness 
Office in southeastern Ethiopia, told state-run media Friday the Somalis 
were fleeing to the Warder and Afder zones of the Ethiopian region 
formerly known as the Ogaden, which itself has been hit by a serious 
drought. ``The zones where the Somali refugees are now camped has 
been hit by a serius food shortage cause by a severe frought, making 
the problem even more critical,'' Abubaker was quoted as saying. Another 
unnamed official of the Federal Refugees and Returnees Affairs Administration 
emphasized that the Somalis were arriving in Ethiopia to escape effects 
of the drought and not clan-based fighting that has flared up again 
in parts of southern Somalia. It was the first reported mass exodus 
of Somalis into Ethiopia since hundreds of thousands sought refuge 
from civil war and famine in 1993-94. Most of the inhabitants of Ethiopia's 
Region 5 are ethnic Somalis.
