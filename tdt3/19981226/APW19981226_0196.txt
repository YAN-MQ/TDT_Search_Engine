The rougher the seas, the better. It's an unusual motto for a sailor. 
But for Laendert Langbroek, gale-force winds and choppy surf provide 
a welcome challenge when he isn't frantically trying to save someone's 
life. Langbroek is one of 500 members of the Royal Dutch Rescue Institute, 
the corps that has been helping North Sea mariners in distress for 
almost 175 years. They are all volunteers. It's not ``Baywatch'' _ 
between distress calls it can get pretty monotonous. So for these 
saviors at sea, the daily struggle of man vs. nature helps break up 
the routine. ``You have to have a real affection for the sea,'' said 
Langbroek, coxswain aboard the rescue ship Christien. Known by its 
Dutch acronym, KNRM, the independent, nonprofit organization stands 
vigil from its 35 stations along the Dutch coast. For Langbroek, that 
can mean riding the swells and dips of crashing waves in a four-man 
boat capable of cruising at 40 mph (65 kph). Clad in bright orange 
thermal rescue suits and radio headsets with giant earpieces designed 
to keep out the deafening sounds of the sea, the KNRM volunteers rely 
on computer monitors to track their movements and guide them through 
rough conditions toward vessels in distress. Often it ends up being 
a ship foundering in the surf with a stalled engine, or an inexperienced 
``Sunday sailor'' too seasick to steer back to the safety of shore. 
Sometimes the volunteers even have to save each other; during a recent 
training session, one fell overboard by mistake and had to be hauled 
back in. Sometimes it's a matter of life and death. Langbroek's most 
memorable rescue call came a few years ago during a raging storm. 
Several Danish sailors had fallen overboard, and Langbroek and his 
crew spent hours in the dark searching the churning waters with floodlights. 
They never found the bodies. At 1,500 distress calls a year, the job 
of rescuer is a rigorous commitment. Volunteers are on call 24 hours 
a day. When their beepers go off, they must report to their ships 
within 10 minutes. Many weekends are spent on training exercises. 
For their time at sea, volunteers get a stipend equivalent to about 
a dollar an hour. After a long day, crew members often pool their 
money for refreshments at the boathouse. ``It's the beer fund,'' said 
Kees Brinkman, a KNRM spokesman. Despite the long hours and lack of 
pay, the corps has a waiting list for joining its prestigious rescue 
crews. ``We have three times as many volunteers as we need,'' Brinkman 
said. Because of that, it is able to select the most seaworthy, experienced 
and readily available people for its corps. Those selected join a 
proud group that began in 1824, when rescuers used horses to launch 
their boats and rowed out to vessels in trouble. The KNRM plans to 
celebrate its 175th anniversary next year with a show of Dutch pragmatism: 
replacing its older steel boats with faster aluminum ones. The new 
craft, which cost about 2.5 million guilders (dlrs 1.3 million) each, 
are being paid for entirely with donations and the proceeds of Christmas 
card sales. Other fund-raising ideas are under consideration, including 
one to develop a rescue simulation ride for children. ``We get letters 
from little boys all the time,'' said Wessel Agterhof, another volunteer. 
``They all want to know how they can be rescuers.''
