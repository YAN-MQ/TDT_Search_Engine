When it comes to New Year's Eve, I am firmly in the camp of pink champagne 
and black cha-cha heels. I can't fathom the phenomenon of trekking 
off to resorts to attend a lot of earnest panels and hang out with 
all the same people we are sick of seeing on MSNBC. In their only 
point of bipartisan agreement, Democrats and Republicans have conspired 
to ruin New Year's Eve by turning it into a tiresome gabfest. Clintonites 
have their annual Renaissance Weekend at Hilton Head, S.C., and conservatives 
aped them with their own version, held this year at the Arizona Biltmore. 
(By the time they get to Phoenix, I'll be here.) It's a hard call 
which New Year's Eve festivity is more irresistible _ getting wasted 
with Strobe Talbott and Norm Ornstein jawing about ``Y2K Internet 
Hazards and Other Geek Tragedies'' or boogying down with C. Boyden 
Gray and Grover Norquist to debate ``Can the Republican Party Be Fixed?'' 
The Clintons will again toast the New Year at their elitist, wonkish 
schmooze, immortalized as ``the saturnalia of soul-searching by the 
sea,'' by The New York Times' Todd Purdum. At the dawn of the Clinton 
era, the First Couple arrived in South Carolina to talk about personal 
and national renewal, bearing overflowing boxes of work papers monogrammed 
``BC'' and ``HRC.'' It always seemed a bit self-consciously high-minded 
and exhibitionistically introspective _ sharing vulnerabilities and 
building an inner life with 1,500 other people. I recall one panel 
during the health-care debate called ``The Mind of Ira Magaziner,'' 
moderated by Mrs. Ira Magaziner. But in this year of infidelity and 
impeachment, the whole enterprise seems even more like parody. Will 
the president dare to let loose at the panels entitled ``Something 
That's Been Bugging Me Lately'' or ``Whoops! Mistakes: Their Lessons 
and Consequences'' or ``Character _ What Is It? Does It Count? Has 
Its Meaning Changed? How Do We Teach It?'' Will Hillary take a connubial 
hint from the panel ``Dropping Life's Baggage Can Lighten the Load''? 
The conservatives at first dubbed their imitation Renaissance Weekend 
``The Dark Ages,'' when they were flying high in 1994. It was a sly 
dig at the Clintonites' pretension to world historical progressivism. 
But now Republicans call it ``The Weekend, the event formerly known 
as Dark Ages,'' to disguise the uncomfortable fact that Republicans 
have, in fact, brought about the Dark Ages. Toning down the GOP image 
as an army of wing-tipped Huns, the Event Formerly Known as Dark Ages 
has a panel called ``America's Ethnic Future, and How We Need to Address 
It.'' They'll need to address it very gingerly, given that Trent Lott 
and Bob Barr have both been exposed for speaking to a white supremacist 
group. Neither party has updated panels in light of the astonishing 
events of this past year. So, it falls to others to do their work 
for them. The Clintons could use that assembled brain-power to ramp 
up to the Senate impeachment trial. Useful preparatory panels might 
include: ``Nutty and Slutty: What the Sliming of Anita Hill Can Teach 
About the Sliming of Monica Lewinsky.'' Panelists: Greg Craig, David 
Talbot, Sidney Blumenthal. ``Ontology in the Oval Office: The Many 
Splendored Meanings of `Is.''' Panelists: Bill Clinton, David Kendall 
and Charles Ruff. ``R-E-S-P-E-C-T: How Many Times, O Lord, Do I Have 
to Save His ...?'' A conversation with Hillary Clinton. ``I Cheated 
on Him Because He Cheated on Me: Loyalty in the Clinton Years.'' Panelists: 
George Stephanopoulos, Mike McCurry and Dick Morris. The Republicans 
should use their discussion time to ponder whether they really want 
to wreck the country and their party. ``Getting Larry Flynted: Why 
the Heck Is What's Good for the Goose Good for the Gander?'' Panelists: 
Bob Livingston, Henry Hyde and Dan Burton. ``The Impossible Dream: 
Digging Up Dirt on Al Gore and Bill Bradley.'' A conversation with 
Lucianne Goldberg. ``The Blondes Leading the Blind: Leggy Punditry 
in the 21st Century.'' Panelists: Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter, Kellyanne 
Fitzpatrick and Barbara Olson. ``The Mind of Ken Starr,'' moderated 
by Mrs. Ken Starr. (No children under 17 permitted.)
