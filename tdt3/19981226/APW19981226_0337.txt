Two leaders of the Khmer Rouge reign of terror in the 1970s defected 
to the government Saturday in a deal marking the death rattle of the 
bloodstained revolutionary group but unlikely to bring them to justice. 
Prime Minister Hun Sen said he personally negotiated the final touches 
on the defections Friday night _ the 20th anniversary of the Christmas 
1978 invasion by Vietnam that toppled the genocidal regime. Khieu 
Samphan, long the nominal Khmer Rouge leader while others held real 
power, and political chief Nuon Chea said in letters read by Hun Sen 
on national radio that they wished to become ``ordinary citizens.'' 
Hun Sen later brushed aside questions whether they would be brought 
to trial for the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians, indicating 
a deal had been struck allowing them to surrender in exchange for 
not being tried. ``We should not talk about any court,'' Hun Sen said. 
``This is a time when we should talk about reconciliation.'' The defections 
leave at large only one major Khmer Rouge figure, the one-legged general 
Ta Mok, known as ``The Butcher,'' and fewer than 100 die-hard loyalists. 
Om Yentieng, an aide to Hun Sen, said that Ta Mok's arrest is still 
sought. Hun Sen said in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he 
``would like to warmly welcome the two'' in the interests of ``national 
reconstruction and peace.'' The king, who is in Beijing receiving 
medical treatment, expressed his ``profound gratitude about this good 
news'' in a response to the prime minister broadcast Saturday night 
on national radio. The defectors were key players in the Khmer Rouge's 
rule after the Maoist revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975. The 
Khmer Rouge emptied the cities and sent the populations to agricultural 
labor camps in the countryside. Perhaps one Cambodian in five died 
of overwork, disease, starvation and systematic executions. Cambodia's 
current leaders and the United States have said in the past that they 
wanted Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and Ta Mok captured and tried for 
genocide and crimes against humanity. Longtime Khmer Rouge leader 
Pol Pot _ purged in a bloody power struggle last year _ died of a 
purported heart attack in April under house arrest by his ex-comrades. 
A team of legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited Cambodia 
last month to assess evidence for a possible international tribunal. 
Local U.N. officials said the report was due to reach Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan in a few weeks. Om Yentieng said the prime minister supports 
a tribunal but that justice should be left to local courts _ woefully 
unequipped for such a task. Over the past two years, the government 
has adopted a policy of negotiating de facto amnesty with Khmer Rouge 
leaders to persuade them to end nearly two decades of stalemated civil 
war. The strategy brought peace to large areas of Cambodia for the 
first time in a generation, but means that none of the group's most 
bloodstained chieftains has been taken into custody. Khieu Samphan 
and Nuon Chea have surfaced in Pailin in Cambodia's rugged northwest. 
The area is controlled by one of their old comrades, Pol Pot's brother-in-law 
Ieng Sary, the first Khmer Rouge leader to make peace with the government. 
Their letters said they had sealed their defection by telephone Friday 
with Hun Sen, who formed a new government last month expected to curb 
the political instability long exploited by the Khmer Rouge. ``I have 
no other request except a request to be allowed to live as a simple 
citizen,'' Khieu Samphan wrote. The defections come weeks after Khmer 
Rouge chief of staff Khem Ngun and seven other generals surrendered. 
Khem Ngun said that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea had not attached conditions 
to their surrender. In Thailand, which closely monitors Khmer Rouge 
activities, Maj. Gen. Wiwat Sattarak, chief of the border task force, 
said that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea moved to defect a month ago. 
``Ta Mok remains with a handful of loyalist troops willing to die 
for him. There's no more than 100,'' Wiwat said. ``The Cambodian government's 
attitude is to let him grow old and die by himself, it's not worth 
the money to chase him.'' Youk Chhang, director of a Cambodian research 
center devoted to gathering evidence against the Khmer Rouge, said 
Hun Sen risks losing support from Cambodians if he prevents a trial. 
``With Nuon Chea, it is very clear he was involved in dealing with 
security, prisoners and torture,'' Youk Chhang said. `Khieu Samphan, 
however, was more involved in making government policy.''
