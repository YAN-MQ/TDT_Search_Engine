This is Orelon Sidney from the CNN weather center with your "Headline 
News weather update." A cold front continues to move off the east 
coast today. And we're watching an area of low pressure move across 
the Great Lakes. This will cause snow showers across most of the lakes 
with a new cold front moving into the northern plains by late Sunday. 
Look for two areas of low pressure in the west -- one causing showers 
and snow showers across the Rockies, the other causing rainfall in 
the northwest. High temperatures will be in the single digits, teens, 
20s and 30s for much of the northeast and into the Rockies. You'll 
see 40s, 50s and 60s for the southwest into southern Florida. The 
extended forecast includes heavy rain and snow in the west on Monday 
with a mix of rain, snow and even thunderstorms in the east and the 
southeast. These will continue into Tuesday with snow showers across 
the northern plains and heavy rain in the pacific northwest forecast. 
A mix takes over in the west on Wednesday. You'll see snow showers 
and snow continuing through the Great Lakes, with scattered showers 
across the southeast. The extended forecast for more than 7,000 cities 
is at CNN.com.
