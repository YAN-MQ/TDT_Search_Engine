Shoppers were out early this morning across the U.S. as merchants 
extended hours and slashed prices to attract bargain seekers. In addition 
to handling the usual gift exchanges and returns, merchants are looking 
to clear their shelves and racks of items passed over in the holiday 
shopping frenzy. Many count on after-Christmas buying to boost the 
bottom line. Shoppers will find the best deals on cold weather clothing 
and toys.
