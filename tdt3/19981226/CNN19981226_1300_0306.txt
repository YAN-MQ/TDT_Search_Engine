After failing once more to be the first to fly around the world non-stop 
in a balloon, American millionaire Steve Fossett and British tycoon 
Richard branson say they're ready to give it another shot. They and 
partner per Lindstrand of Sweden had to abort their latest attempt 
yesterday when bad weather made them land their balloon in the pacific 
ocean, near Hawaii. Fossett says the thought of attaining what he 
calls the "greatest unachieved aviation" goal will probably get him 
in the air at least one more time.
