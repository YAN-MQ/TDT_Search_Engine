Police said an alleged drug lord who accused three prominent police 
officials of having ties to the drug world hanged himself in a detention 
center Saturday, but the man's lawyers expressed doubts about whether 
he committed suicide, according to the Anatolia news agency. Huseyin 
Uzun, who was wanted by police on drug smuggling charges, surrendered 
to police last week and immediately accused the three police officials 
of links to the drug world, igniting a controversy over ties between 
state officials and organized crime. A court refused to investigate 
the officers saying the evidence against them was insufficient, Anatolia 
said. Turkey is a major transit point for drugs moving from Afghanistan 
through Europe and North America. Police said Uzun hanged himself 
in a toilet with strips of his blanket. ``I saw the scene, it is very 
surprising,'' said Zekai Sems, one of Uzun's lawyers. Another lawyer, 
Haci Ibrahimoglu, said that committing suicide with pieces of a blanket 
was quite difficult, the news agency said. Istanbul police chief Hasan 
Ozdemir said an investigation has been launched into Uzun's death. 
A car crash two years ago confirmed for the first time what many Turks 
long suspected _ that state officials entertained close relations 
with mobsters. A fugitive terrorist, a police chief and a deputy were 
all riding in the same car. The wreck set off a chain reaction of 
investigations and allegations which led to the sacking of several 
policemen, the trial of two deputies including a former interior minister, 
and the collapse of the government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz 
last month.
