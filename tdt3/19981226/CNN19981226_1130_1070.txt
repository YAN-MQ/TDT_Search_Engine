College football bowl action is under way. Highlights are next in 
"CNN Headline Sports." A child is abused or neglected. Every 30 minutes, 
more than 1,000 students are attacked on school grounds. In one hour, 
children watch as many as 25 violent acts on TV. Every two hours, 
a child dies of a gunshot wound. Our children are exposed to an overwhelming 
amount of crime and violence. We as parents have the power and the 
responsibility to safeguard our children. Get involved - join your
