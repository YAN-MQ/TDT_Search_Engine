Tribal elders decreed a ``day of joy'' to welcome the village's new 
arrival. Guarani boys in face paint and loincloths danced to the music 
of a homemade fiddle played with a tree branch. The celebration was 
for the long-awaited coming of the ``ayu ryrurive,'' a Guarani term 
roughly meaning ``box for accumulating language'' _ that is, a computer. 
``We have been hearing about computers for a while,'' said Luiz Eusebio, 
an assistant chief at the Sapukai (sah-poo-kah-EE) village. ``We thought 
we need to learn about them because we need to have more knowledge 
about non-Indians.'' Their ticket to the information age came recently 
from the Committee for the Democratization of Information, a private 
group that provides computers and training to poor communities, mostly 
the hillside slums of Rio de Janeiro. But it seemed unlikely computers 
would come to the 400 Guaranis of Sapukai, a 5,200-acre (2,080-hectare) 
community tucked among lush green mountains along the coastal highway 
100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Rio. For one thing, the village 
had no electricity. ``I always dreamed of bringing computers to an 
Indian reservation, but I didn't know how,'' Rodrigo Baggio, the group's 
president, said while he pulled cables from the back of his car to 
install four personal computers at the village's Federal Indian Bureau 
post. Most of Brazil's 300,000 Indians live in the remote Amazon, 
too far for Baggio's group to travel. But the Guarani were close enough 
to bring in a gasoline-powered generator to run the computers. With 
the help of the Indian Bureau and the Indigenous Missionary Council, 
which has ties to the Roman Catholic Church, Baggio set out to install 
computers and provide training for the village's five teachers. The 
first step was having teacher Ernesto da Silva come to Rio for a week 
of instruction. ``It's like anything else. At first it's hard, and 
then you get used to it,'' said da Silva, beaming proudly before a 
drawing of the village's school he made using a computer. Baggio's 
goal is to provide job training for poor communities and help them 
organize. But at Sapukai, no one expressed any interest in the idea 
of working outside the reservation. The tribe plans to use the computers 
mainly to keep health records, develop educational materials and build 
a database of Guarani history, myths and traditions. Besides, they 
can afford only enough gasoline to run the generator for a couple 
of hours twice a week. Baggio said he hopes to bring solar power to 
Sapukai, if he can raise the money. But despite come concessions to 
Western culture _ shorts, T-shirts, plastic sandals, metal pots and 
even a little Portuguese _ the tribe's leaders are wary about the 
impact computers might have on their lives. ``If we use the computer 
more than twice a week, we won't have time to plant. And if we don't 
plant, we starve,'' said Eusebio, the assistant chief. ``We also know 
if we turn them off they will just sit there. It's not like they can 
run around the village causing trouble.''
