Bananas were 11 cents a pound. A set of 15 Christmas tree lights was 
69 cents. The New York Times was a dime. Christmas comes every 29 
or 30 years for New York Jets fans. This is one of the rare good years, 
a phenomenon that for the faithful is as sweet and as difficult to 
grasp as a winning lottery ticket. To get a sense of what it's usually 
like to be a Jets fan, imagine a gambler in a lifelong craps game 
who is destined always to roll snake eyes. When I asked my assistant 
to pull the clips on the last time the Jets were champions of their 
division, as they are now, she had to hunt (electronically) through 
newspaper stacks that are older than she is. Return with us now to 
Dec. 7, 1969. Vietnam was raging. Richard Nixon was wrapping up his 
first year as president. ``Man of La Mancha'' was on Broadway and 
you could get seats in the balcony for $3.75. The 1970s loomed but 
no one realized how different they would be from the astonishing and 
tumultuous '60s. And no one could possibly have known that a president 
would be chased from office under the threat of impeachment and another 
would actually be impeached before the Jets would win another championship. 
The headline that day in the sports section of The New York Times 
said, ``Jets Top Oilers, 34-26, and Take Title.'' On the same page 
was a story about Bill Bradley leading the Knicks to a victory over 
the Milwaukee Bucks. Bradley was 26. While the Jets were wandering 
like sad sacks through the fields of football futility, he would complete 
his Hall of Fame basketball career, complete a distinguished career 
in the Senate and put together plans for his own possible run for 
the presidency. Jets fans during that same period were growing up, 
having children, and some of those children were having children. 
And yet most fans remained true to the woeful team that came to be 
known as Gang Green, a team that spent most of the '70s, '80s and 
'90s nurturing masters in the fine art of losing. Why would anyone 
root for such a terrible team for so long? Emerson comes to mind. 
He once said: ``There are people who have an appetite for grief. Pleasure 
is not strong enough and they crave pain.'' The Times' Gerald Eskenazi, 
in his book ``Gang Green,'' quotes Rabbi Myron Fenster, former head 
of the New York Board of Rabbis. ``It's good for the soul,'' the rabbi 
said. ``It teaches you about striving and redemption, although I must 
admit I'm waiting for the redemption a long time.'' Redemption came 
in the form of a snarling, superstitious devil named Bill Parcells. 
This coach is not like anything the Jets or their fans have ever experienced. 
To Parcells, losing is as acceptable as self-immolation. He is not 
like Weeb Ewbank, a nice man who, while coaching the Jets in the Super 
Bowl in January 1969, forgot himself and said of the opposing quarterback, 
Johnny Unitas, who had once played for Ewbank: ``Come on, John, don't 
throw any interceptions.'' Parcells has decreed that the foolishness 
will cease. He is a tyrant, a ruthless enforcer who has wrought a 
miraculous change in one of the worst franchises in sports. He shoves 
his players around and is quick to belittle people. He once sidled 
up to the gifted wide receiver Wayne Chrebet and deliberately kicked 
him in his injured ankle. He is nasty to reporters and won't let his 
assistant coaches talk to them. But he knows football. He has won 
everywhere he's been and is winning with the Jets. Desperation can 
lead to odd embraces and Jets fans have embraced Parcells. The team, 
which won just one of 16 games two years ago, is 11-4 this year. It 
can win its 12th game Sunday afternoon, which would be the highest 
regular-season victory total in team history. If the Jets win two 
games in the playoffs they will go to the Super Bowl. ``Hope is all 
Jets fans have ever wanted,'' said Eskenazi in ``Gang Green.'' The 
longtime fans are older, wider and grayer now and giddy at the prospect 
of more wins to come. Instead of snake eyes, they are rolling consistent 
sevens and elevens. Sainthood never occasioned such glee. For the 
moment, it's high-fives all around. Jets fans have learned there is 
nothing like a pact with the devil, and you go with it until the devil 
demands his due.
