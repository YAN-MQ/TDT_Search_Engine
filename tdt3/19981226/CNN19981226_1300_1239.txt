Matt Yallof, "CNN Headline Sports." After a few days of rest, busy 
schedule in the NHL today, you won't be seeing Chris bratan lacing 
up. The Tampa bay center is suspended for three games for allegedly 
spitting on an official on Wednesday's loss to Buffalo. Lightening 
coach and GM Jacque DeMeres issued a statement saying bratan denies 
the allegation. In arguing a call with referee Paul Stewart, bratan 
may have sprayed stewart with saliva. Well, the guy bratan was traded 
for will also miss some action. Michael rennberg out indefinitely 
with a separated shoulder. The Flyers forward suffered the injury 
in Wednesday's win over Boston. Rennberg missed time earlier this 
season with a broken finger.
