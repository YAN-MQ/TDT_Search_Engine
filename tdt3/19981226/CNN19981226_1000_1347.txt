A playoff spot is certainly what the Arizona Cardinals are looking 
for to close out their Christmas wish list. All they have to do is 
win their final regular-season game over San Diego, or if Tampa bay 
and the giants lose. People are very excited about the Cardinals. 
And it gives you a good feeling, you know, to see some hard work pay 
off and to see people appreciate the work that you put in. As a team, 
we are enjoying certain aspects of it, but it still boils down to 
us taking care of business this weekend.
