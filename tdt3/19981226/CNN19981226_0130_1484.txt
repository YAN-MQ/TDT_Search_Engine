In El Salvador, a small town is celebrating Christmas in a unique 
way. Its residents are known around the world for making nativity 
scenes out of mud. They have been creating figurines of Mary, Joseph 
and the baby Jesus for generations. Artists soften the mud by stepping 
on it, then they shape the figures by hand and paint them. The final 
products are packaged and shipped around the globe.
