A Romanian convicted of murder used the classic knotted bedsheet technique 
to escape from a Milan prison when guards were short-staffed for Christmas. 
The Italian news agency ANSA reported that guards noticed Joan Ursut, 
who was serving a 21-year sentence at Opera prison for the murder 
of an Italian gangster, missing about lunch time on Friday. Fog hampered 
the search for the 40-year-old Romanian, who had been at the prison 
since 1989. The poor visibility made it impossible for police helicopters 
to join in the search, which used officers and dogs on the ground, 
ANSA said. The report said that Ursut, who was allowed to have some 
movement around the prison, lowered himself out of window opposite 
a section of surrounding outside wall where no guards were on duty, 
apparently due to the shortage of help on Christmas. According to 
reports from Sweden, Ursut escaped from jails in that country twice. 
A prisoner at a Rome jail recently used the knotted sheet technique 
in a successful escape.
