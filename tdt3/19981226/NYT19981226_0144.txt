E.W. ``Skip'' Etchells, a boat builder and world champion yachtsman, 
died last Sunday in Memorial Hospital in Easton, Md. He was 87. Most 
yacht racing is done in one-design sailboats, all built to a specific 
design so that the outcome rests with the skill of the crew rather 
than the builder. In the 1940s and the 1950s, Etchells dominated international 
competition in the one-design Star Class. In the 1960s, he created 
a new one-design yacht, the Etchells 22, now known as the International 
Etchells Class. Etchells built Stars for 30 years and Etchells 22s 
for 20 years. In 1951, with his wife, Mary, as crew, he won the Star 
Class world championship. She is the only woman to have won a world 
title in this popular boat. Skip Etchells won the 1959 North American 
Star Class and many U.S. and international championships. Some victories 
came on Long Island Sound, where one-design racing is popular. Ellwood 
Widmer Etchells was born July 5, 1911, in Philadelphia and raised 
in Trenton, N.J. At the University of Michigan he won three consecutive 
Big Ten titles in the discus throw. He graduated in 1936 with a degree 
in naval architecture and engineering. He started designing boats 
and during World War II he helped build destroyers and icebreakers 
for the Navy. After the war, he worked in New York for Sparkman &AMP; 
Stephens, the well-known yacht designers. After two years, he founded 
Old Greenwich (Conn.) Boat Co., which became a leading builder of 
Stars, Lightnings and other one-design boats. In 1965 and 1966, the 
International Yacht Racing Union held a competition in Kiel, Germany, 
to choose a new three-man keelboat for the Olympics. The six entries 
included an Etchells-designed craft 30 feet 6 inches long, with a 
wooden hull covered with fiberglass. Although it won 10 of the 13 
races, the officials chose a 27-foot Soling. A disappointed Etchells 
said only, ``The various sponsors never were called upon to present 
their plans or arguments.'' But sailors around the world praised his 
yacht, and he started production of the class that he called the Etchells 
22 because the boat's waterline length is 22 feet. The design's first 
national championship was held in 1968. Etchells won it and sailed 
in Etchells 22 races throughout the 1970s. In 1984, Skip and Mary 
Etchells retired to Easton. He is survived by his wife of 57 years, 
the former Mary O'Toole; a son, Tim of Middlebury, Vt.; a daughter, 
Anne Nieusma of Easton, and three grandchildren. Tim Etchells, a senior 
editor of the magazine Mountain Sports and Living, said his father 
would be remembered for designing ``very fast boats.'' ``The Etchells 
22 is probably the fastest keelboat of its length before or since,'' 
the son said. ``In addition to being fast, it's a delight to sail. 
Last summer, more than 100 of them sailed in the world championship 
in Marblehead, Mass. There were 15 Olympic champions in the fleet. 
The Etchells Class is a nice legacy to him.''
