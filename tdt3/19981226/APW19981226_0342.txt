Arab states should break the U.N. sanctions on Iraq which are inflicting 
``great suffering'' on the Iraqi people, the speaker of the Iraqi 
National Assembly said Saturday. Speaking to reporters after arriving 
in Amman for an emergency meeting of the Arab Parliamentary union, 
Saadoun Hammadi said he hoped the session would produce a unified 
call for the lifting of the sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion 
of Kuwait. ``All Arab nations must lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq,'' 
he said. He said the meeting scheduled for Sunday was a ``reflection 
of Arab masses' condemnation of the U.S.-British aggression on Iraq 
and a demand for governments to break the embargo.'' Last week the 
United States and Britain carried out four nights of air strikes on 
Iraq to punish the Baghdad government for its alleged obstruction 
of U.N. weapons inspectors. The attacks were aimed at military and 
government targets. Iraq says that 62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians 
were killed in the bombardment. Iraqi Cabinet ministers have often 
toured Middle Eastern capitals to encourage Arab governments to defy 
the sanctions regime. But so far no Middle Eastern state has done 
more than turn a blind eye to smuggling into Iraq. ``The embargo on 
Iraq has caused great suffering to the Iraqi people,'' Hammadi said. 
Eighteen out of the Parliamentary Union's 19 member-states are due 
to send delegations to the meeting. Kuwait has said it will not take 
part. The U.N. Security Council has said it will not lift the sanctions 
until Iraq proves to the U.N. inspectors it has eliminated its weapons 
of mass destruction.
