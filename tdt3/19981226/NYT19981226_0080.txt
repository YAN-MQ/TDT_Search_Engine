Canada has its queen and, as some politicians are discovering, God 
save those who would try to sever the country from its monarch. Senior 
advisers to Prime Minister Jean Chretien, along with some unnamed 
leaders of the governing Liberal Party, are still smarting from the 
sharp response they received to a recent informal proposal to mark 
Canada's entrance into the new millennium by finally cutting all the 
country's ties to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. After the unnamed 
leaders passed along the idea to a friendly reporter and the trial 
balloon was sent up in a prominent article, crowds of loyalists came 
out to shoot it down. ``A bauble on the national Christmas tree that 
these people think they can pluck off in 1999,'' was what John Aimers 
thought of the Liberal idea. Aimers had been through this fight before, 
which was why he helped found the Monarchist League of Canada, based 
in Toronto, more than 20 years ago. ``This is a naive, fanciful project 
of some gutless wonders in Ottawa who don't want to attach their names 
to this,'' Aimers said. ``They should be more careful of what they 
let slip.'' There was a significant amount of backpedaling in the 
halls of Parliament after the first reports of the dump-the-queen 
plan were released. Although the prime minister's office had made 
it clear that Chretien was anxious to hear what Canadians thought 
of the idea, in a year-end interview with the Canadian news magazine 
Maclean's, Chretien said that abolishing the monarchy was not a priority. 
``I have enough problems with the separatists in Quebec,'' Chretien 
said, ``I don't want to have problems with the monarchists in Ontario.'' 
And Sophie Galarneau, a spokeswoman for Chretien, said, ``While it's 
certainly true that the prime minister would like to know what Canadians 
think about it, this is not a government project at this point.'' 
Although some officials, like Industry Minister John Manley, have 
openly espoused a republican Canada, Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray 
went on television to play down the idea. The premier of Prince Edward 
Island then said he would be the first to cast the one veto it would 
take from the provinces to block any such amendment. Columnists at 
some of Canada's largest newspapers gleefully took shots at the plan. 
Dan Gardner, writing in the Ottawa Citizen _ the newspaper that broke 
the story _ noted that the plan was billed as a visionary project 
to mark the year 2000. But, he wondered, ``Can't we just build a giant 
dome or something?'' In The Montreal Gazette, columnist Tommy Schnurmacher 
called the idea of throwing out the queen ``impertinent.'' Canada's 
relationship to the queen is a complex one, similar to that of Australia, 
another member of the British Commonwealth seeking to come out from 
Britain's shadow. For several years, the Australians have engaged 
in a debate over whether to remove the queen as head of state. Feelings 
toward the royal family are warmer in Canada than they are in Australia, 
said Aimers of the Monarchist League, at least in English-speaking 
Canada. While most Quebecers are cool to the crown, royal visits to 
the Maple Kingdom, as the Monarchists call it, almost always attract 
big crowds, and members of the royal family often vacation in Canada. 
While vowing allegiance to the queen is considered by some Canadians 
to reveal a lack of independence, Aimers points out that under the 
Canadian constitution, Queen Elizabeth is actually Canada's own monarch, 
quite separate and apart from being Queen of England or Queen of Australia, 
titles she also holds. Also, the queen's role as head of state, Aimers 
said, ``is first and foremost the most significant distinction between 
Canada and the United States.'' On its Internet site (www.monarchist.ca), 
the Monarchist League sells stickers with pictures of the Queen that 
it suggests can be attached to letters to the government to show support 
for the Maple Crown, and bumper stickers that say ``My Canada Includes 
the Monarchy.'' The Canadian writer Robertson Davies once called the 
crown ``the consecrated spirit of Canada.'' Despite changing times, 
monarchists want the queen's profile to remain on all Canadian coins, 
and they insist the queen is still a central figure in Canadian life. 
That much was proved quite smartly, Aimers said, when the country's 
immigration service retained the mention of the sovereign in the Canadian 
oath of citizenship that was recently updated. The oath, repeated 
by all immigrants who become Canadian citizens, still says, ``I pledge 
my loyalty and allegiance to Canada and Her Majesty, Elizabeth the 
Second, Queen of Canada.''
