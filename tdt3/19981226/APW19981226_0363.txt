Teeton Mill, a 7-2 shot ridden by Norman Williamson, romped away to 
win the 100,000-pound (dlrs 167,000) King George VI Chase on Saturday 
to emulate Desert Orchid and One Man as top-quality grays to win the 
prestigous race. Trained by Venetia Williams, the 9-year-old gelding 
stayed near the front of the field of nine for the entire 3 miles 
(4.8 kilometer) race at Kempton Park. He hit the front coming to the 
last and had only Richard Johnson's Escartefigue for company with 
last year's winner, See More Business, fading fast and eventually 
pulling up. Defying the soft going in the straight, Williamson kept 
Teeton Mill ahead and moved smoothly to away to make a tough race 
look easy. Imperial Call, winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup two years 
ago, was a long way back third with last season's King George runner 
up, Challenger Du Luc, fourth. After this performance, bookmaker William 
Hill cut Teeton Mill's odds from 14-1 to 4-1 for the Gold Cup and 
8-1 for the Grand National Steeplechase at Aintree.
