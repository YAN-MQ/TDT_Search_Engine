A government deadline for replacing or upgrading underground gasoline 
storage tanks, is threatening to shut down a tiny California desert 
town. Jennifer Auther reports. New underground storage tanks were 
lowered into the ground this week in desolate Chiriaco summit. The 
town lies alongside interstate 10, about 50 miles east of Palm Springs, 
california. Down a little lower! But these tanks won't be operational 
in time for the Chiriaco family to meet a federal and state deadline 
to replace or upgrade their old tanks. Older tanks have been declared 
environmentally hazardous, and station owners have had ten years to 
comply. Initially, Margaret Chiriaco and her brother Bob prepared 
for a showdown. We're pledged to continue to be responsible, not only 
to the community, but to the community on wheels that travels interstate 
10. Such dedication comes from the fact that their parents founded 
this tiny desert hamlet in 1933. It is so remote, general George Patton 
trained desert troops here in world war II. Now there are 60 residents. 
Each depends on a Diesel-powered generator. It provides the cooling 
for the food. It provides the lights. It provides the heat. It provides 
the water for everything. We run the towing business and we have to 
live here. So, I mean, if there's no power, we can't live here. But 
in what first appeared to be an 11th-hour reprieve, the riverside 
county board of supervisors voted to grant the chiriacos a Six-week 
extension. We have to make sure that the office of emergency services 
works with them, that the state recognizes it as an emergency. We're 
pretty confident our contractors can knock it out. Unfortunately for 
motorists, California's EPA forced the chiriacos to close their gas 
station on Christmas eve. They've decided to rent an above-ground 
storage tank so they can continue to give power to the people. Jennifer 
Auther, CNN, reporting.
