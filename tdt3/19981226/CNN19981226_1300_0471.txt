Nine young partygoers in Lima, Peru, are dead after someone threw 
a tear gas canister into a crowded nightclub early yesterday. The 
victims were crushed to death or suffocated as people scrambled to 
get away from the choking gas. Police say eight people were badly 
injured. The club was filled to double its capacity when the tear 
gas canister exploded.
