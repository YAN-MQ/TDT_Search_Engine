An American in Baghdad is an odd and even provocative sight, so it 
was perhaps not surprising when a group of young Iraqis congregated 
around one who was wandering through a poor neighborhood on a recent 
afternoon. ``When I see an American or a Zionist, I want to hit him,'' 
one man called out. But his comrades quickly shouted him down. ``I 
am more civilized than to be angry at you,'' one of them, Ahmed Jasim, 
a 21-year-old student, said in fluent English. ``This war is not your 
fault. It is the fault of your government. But I want to ask you: 
When will you take us off your agenda? When will you start letting 
us live like human beings again?'' Officials in Washington have a 
simple answer to that question. They say they have no quarrel with 
the Iraqi people and that the recent bombing of Iraqi targets _ like 
the economic sanctions against this country that have been in place 
for eight years _ are aimed solely at President Saddam Hussein and 
his regime. That argument rings hollow to many Iraqis. Their lives 
have deteriorated steadily, and they have no way to affect the government 
under which they live. Nonetheless, they are remarkably friendly to 
Americans who venture here. Journalists and others are allowed to 
wander freely as long as they do not take photographs. A foreigner 
taking notes on a busy street, even in the sight of police officers, 
does not arouse any evident suspicion. Several journalists have been 
expelled, however, for asking Iraqis probing questions about what 
they think of Saddam. Others have been denied return visas after showing 
what was judged to be excessive curiosity about military installations 
or presidential palaces. ``People here have an astonishing capacity 
for friendship and forgiveness,'' said Anne Montgomery, who is part 
of a Chicago-based group campaigning for an end to sanctions. ``I'm 
not sure Americans would respond the same way if we were the ones 
being bombed. I personally have encountered no rancor or hostility.'' 
Americans who have made repeated visits here say they have noticed 
one clear change in attitudes recently. They say that while many Iraqis 
have been angry with the U.S. government for some time, they now show 
special animosity toward President Clinton. They have come to view 
him as the personification of forces that are bombing and blockading 
them, just as they saw President Bush during the Persian Gulf war. 
``It is not your fault, it's Clinton who is killing us,'' Barnoon 
al-Kadisia, an unemployed laborer, said as he sipped tea with a visiting 
American on a recent afternoon. ``We love welcoming you in our country.'' 
Mel Lehman, a writer from New York who is working on a book about 
the effect of sanctions on the Iraqi people, said he arrived here 
at the beginning of December and ``got a lot more than I bargained 
for.'' ``Three weeks after I arrived,'' he said, ``bombs started falling 
near my hotel. My phone rang, and it was the reception desk inviting 
me down into the basement shelter. They look at you a little strangely 
because there are very few Americans here, but they're unfailingly 
friendly and kind. I find their attitude a little surprising, frankly, 
but pleasantly surprising.'' Although many of the poorest people in 
Iraq seem astonishingly open to Americans, a prominent university 
professor, Latif al-Jumali, chairman of the English department at 
Baghdad University, did not feel cordial on a recent morning. ``I 
am not interested in speaking to any American journalist,'' al-Jumali 
said as he stepped from his car at the university gate. ``When I had 
the opportunity, I was a regular reader of The New York Times. But 
the Americans and British have severed all possibility of dialogue 
here. I'm sorry, but I am emotional.'' A physician who grew up in 
Britain, Mohammed al-Kaisi, recalled that when he was a teen-ager, 
his British friends would ask him whether he would ever fight against 
them if their countries went to war. ``It was a joke back then, but 
now it's almost serious,'' al-Kaisi said. ``This wouldn't be happening 
if more people could come here and see what the sanctions are doing 
to us. That's why we're happy to see Americans or any other foreigners. 
We need them to understand our situation. They are individuals, and 
wars are not waged by individuals.''
