Iraq will fire on warplanes patroling the no-fly zones, Iraqi Vice 
President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Saturday. Speaking on Qatar's Al-Jazeera 
television, Ramadan was asked if Iraq would accept the overflights 
of U.S. and British aircraft that maintain no-fly zones in northern 
and southern Iraq. ``We say frankly now that any violation of Iraqi 
airspace will be met by Iraqi fire,'' Ramadan said. The United States, 
Britain and France set up the no-fly zones in the years after the 
1991 Gulf War to halt air attacks against Kurdish rebels in the north 
and against Shiite Muslim rebels in the south. The interview was conducted 
in Baghdad hours after Iraq said that its anti-aircraft gunners had 
driven off an attack by ``enemy'' warplanes that flew in from Kuwait 
and Saudi Arabia. The official Iraqi News Agency did not identify 
the nationality of the aircraft, but it usually uses the word ``enemy'' 
to describe warplanes from the United States and Britain. Washington 
and London denied any attack on Iraq. Asked why Iraq had not fired 
previously on planes enforcing the no-fly zones, Ramadan said, ``when 
you want to restore your rights, you choose the suitable time and 
circumstances.'' Ramadan said that the U.S. and British aircraft were 
taking off from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The United States 
has aircraft in both countries. Britain bases aircraft in Kuwait. 
``It appears, but we cannot confirm it, that France has for sometime 
not been participating in these sorties,'' the vice president said. 
French aircraft no longer take part in enforcing the no-fly zone over 
northern Iraq but still help to maintain the southern zone. Iraq has 
never recognized the zones and has occasionally confronted aircraft 
flying in the area. The last major incident in the zone was in June. 
U.S. officials said that a U.S. F-16 warplane fired a missile at an 
anti-aircraft site after Iraqi radar targeted British warplanes patrolling 
the zone. Iraq denied that its forces threatened the British aircraft. 
On Saturday, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P. J. Crowley 
said in Washington that U.S. aircraft had flown over Iraq, but ``they 
reported no incidents of fire directed against them.'' He said, however, 
that ``one aircraft reported anti-aircraft fire well off in the distance.'' 
In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman said a British pilot on Saturday 
``did sight anti-aircraft fire but he did not consider it hostile.'' 
``The Iraqis seem to be loosing off anti-aircraft fire left, right 
and center,'' the spokesman said, speaking on customary condition 
of anonymity. State-controlled Iraqi media have issued almost daily 
reports of violations of the country's airspace since the United States 
and Britain ended four days of airstrikes against Iraq on Dec. 19. 
The strikes were carried out after U.N. weapons inspectors released 
a report saying that Baghdad was blocking their work. Iraq says that 
62 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were killed in the bombardment. 
The Iraqi News Agency said that at 11:15 a.m. (0815 GMT) Saturday 
a formation of warplanes ``attacked one of our air defense sites, 
which confronted it and forced it to drop its load randomly.'' The 
report did not say where the apparent attack took place and gave no 
other details. Also Saturday, the Babil newspaper criticized Iraq's 
most powerful sympathizers on the U.N. Security Council _ France, 
Russia and China _ for not taking stronger action toward easing U.N. 
sanctions against Iraq. The newspaper, which is owned by a son of 
President Saddam Hussein, said that Russia's and China's positions 
``did not accomplish any positive results for Iraq.'' It added that 
the ``fluctuation of the French stand has made us wonder if they are 
with us or against us.'' Security Council diplomats have said the 
sweeping sanctions _ imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 _ will 
not be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has dismantled 
its programs to build weapons of mass destruction. France, Russia, 
China, the United States and Britain, are permanent members of the 
Security Council.
