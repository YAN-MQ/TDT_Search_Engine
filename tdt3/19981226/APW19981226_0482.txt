Alfredo Covelli, who founded a party of monarchists in 1946, the year 
the country voted against continuing the Italian monarchy, has died 
in Rome, Italian news reports said Saturday. Covelli, 84, died on 
Friday. No cause of death was given. Italians in a 1946 referendum 
voted to establish the present republic. Corbelli's National Monarchical 
Party appealed to some of the 11.5 million Italians who had voted 
in favor of keeping the royal family. In 1972, the party was folded 
into the neofascist Italian Social Movement. Covelli served for more 
than 30 years in the Italian Parliament. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, 
in a condolence message, praised Covelli's ``defense of the values 
of the human person and of all that which inspires love for the country.'' 
There were no immediate details about funeral arrangements or survivors.
