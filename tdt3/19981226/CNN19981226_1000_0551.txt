In California, the intentional dumping of several hundred gallons 
of oil in a coastal wetland is creating an ecological nightmare. Experts 
say it may ultimately cause more damage than a major tanker spill. 
Charles Feldman has more. Mass murder happened here -- the bolsa chica 
wetlands in huntington beach, California. Someone dumped as much as 
200 gallons of waste oil into the area a few weeks back. And because 
this is the season for migratory birds along the pacific coast, the 
relatively small oil spill has been a death sentence for many oil-coated 
birds. This spill did significant damage. We are seeing hundreds of 
birds that were oiled that are likely to succumb to that oil over 
time and die. Professional environmentalists and volunteers are racing 
against the clock to try and save as many birds as possible. Despite 
the heroic efforts, nearly 50 birds have already died. Others may. 
The first problem they encounter is their feathers get fouled and 
they lose their waterproofing so they start to become cold. When the 
cold water contacts their skin, hypothermia is the first problem we 
start to see. After that, the birds start to ingest oil, so they can 
have secondary problems related to ingestion. But many birds have 
been saved. Cleaned and cared for, they are set free back into the 
wild. And in return, they have taught experts a valuable lesson about 
oil spills. The lesson to be learned here is that it is not the amount, 
it is the location and the timing. The impact of this spill is large 
considering the amount of oil released. It is unknown what the long-term 
effects might be or how many more birds will die. So it is important 
for whomever dumped the oil to know that mass murder happened here.
