The Pentagon says it wasn't involved in an alleged attack on Iraq 
today. The Iraqi government claims its air defenses drove off enemy 
planes that were attacking an anti-aircraft unit. The report says 
the planes flew from Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti airspace. U.S. warplanes 
are based in both countries, and Britain has planes in kuwait. A U.S. 
military spokesman says no U.S. aircraft were fired upon, and there 
are no aggressive operations under way in Iraq right now.
