In the late 1940s, when William Levitt began building what became 
the model for modern suburbia _ the 17,000-house complex known as 
Levittown, N.Y. _ the Long Island developer employed radiant heating, 
a design element rarely used at the time. Instead of using hot air 
or heavy radiators to heat his houses, Levitt instead used warm water 
pumped through copper pipes soldered together in the cement slab on 
which the house rested. The system provided homeowners with an efficient, 
comfortable source of central heating. Unfortunately, it also created 
some problems when chemicals in the cement conspired with chemicals 
in the solder to eat through the copper, causing the system to fail. 
As a result, many Levittown homeowners switched to conventional systems. 
While residential radiant heating systems are still the exception 
rather than the rule, heating experts say, modern materials and installation 
techniques have made such systems more efficient, more comfortable 
and far less likely to fail than their predecessors. ``The optimal 
heating technology today is radiant heat,'' said Frank Finkel, president 
of Davis &AMP; Warshow, a plumbing- and heating-supply company in 
Maspeth, Queens, New York City. ``And the technology today far surpasses 
anything that was available at the end of World War II.'' Finkel said 
that the cause of the problems with the radiant-heating systems installed 
in Levittown 50 years ago _ a chemical reaction that deteriorated 
the copper pipe _ was no longer a factor in modern radiant-heating, 
or hydronic, technology. ``There are dozens of reputable companies 
that make plastic or rubber radiant-heat tubing that carries a lifetime 
warranty against defects,'' Finkel said, noting that the tubing now 
used in radiant-heat systems was highly flexible yet able to withstand 
high pressures and temperatures. In addition, he said, most manufacturers 
build into their tubing what is known as an oxygen barrier to prevent 
any chemical reaction from occurring between the tubing and whatever 
it happens to be encased in. ``This stuff really works,'' Finkel said. 
Brian Gelber, president of Stan Gelber &AMP; Sons, a heating and air-conditioning 
company in Uniondale, agreed. ``Radiant heat is far superior to any 
other kind of heat,'' Gelber said. ``And that's because instead of 
heating air, you're heating mass.'' Gelber explained that with conventional 
heating systems _ such as forced-air systems, baseboard hot water 
systems and steam or hot-water radiators _ the heat is transferred 
from the heat source to the air in the room. But since air moves around 
a lot and is not very good at holding heat to begin with, he said, 
it is difficult to maintain a constant temperature from room to room 
and even within individual rooms. Moreover, Gelber said, in a conventionally 
heated house, the objects in a room are typically colder than the 
air surrounding them. As a result, such objects will actually draw 
heat from a person on or near them. With a radiant-heating system, 
Gelber said, the system functions not by heating the air in a room, 
but by heating the objects in it. Such objects include things like 
furniture, tables, appliances, carpet, draperies and even walls _ 
starting from the floor and moving up. ``It's like having a gigantic, 
low-temperature radiator encased in the floor,'' he said, explaining 
that since objects in a room retain heat better than air, they are 
less likely to ``steal'' heat from a body in close proximity. ``It 
is an extremely comfortable form of heat,'' he said. Ideally, Gelber 
said, a hydronic system provides the most even heating when the heating 
tubes are installed during construction and embedded in a solid material 
like a cement slab or a ``mud'' layer under a tile floor. Embedding 
of the tubes, however, is not essential. This makes it possible to 
install radiant heat even in existing houses. ``If you have an existing 
wood or tile floor, and have access to the space between the joists 
below, you can retrofit with radiant heat,'' Gelber said. In such 
a case, he explained, the flexible tubing is ``laced'' through the 
spaces between the joists, stapled to the undersurface of the floor 
and then covered with reflective material and insulation. ``One question 
we're always asked is whether the heat from the tubing will dry out 
the wood floor,'' Gelber said. This, he explained, is not so because 
the surface area of the heat source is so large _ essentially, the 
area of the floor itself _ that it only needs to be heated to about 
80 degrees. To do that, he said, the water in the heating tubes must 
be maintained at about 100 degrees _ not so hot that it would dry 
the wood. ``Conventional boilers operate at about 180 degrees,'' he 
said. To compensate for the difference in temperature, he said, water 
going from the boiler to the hydronic tubing is cooled by passing 
it through a mixing valve. In fact, Gelbert said, the mixing valves 
used in hydronic systems also make it possible to use one boiler to 
run both a conventional hot water-heating system and a radiant-heating 
system at the same time. ``That's the beauty of hydronics,'' he said, 
explaining that a homeowner can install radiant heating in just one 
or two rooms _ the kitchen and bathroom, for example _ while using 
the existing hot water heating system for the rest of the house. Kolyn 
Marshall, a sales engineer for Heatway, a manufacturer of radiant-heating 
products in Springfield, Mo., said that in most cases a number of 
mixing valves are used in conjunction with room thermostats to regulate 
temperature on a room-by-room, or zoned, basis. Small circulator pumps 
then move the water through circuits in the room or zones. ``Typically, 
we'll recommend ]-inch diameter tubing in 200-foot circuits,'' Marshall 
said, adding that circuits of up to 300 feet can be installed when 
half-inch diameter tubing is used. The most common concern regarding 
the use of hydronic tubing _ the possibility of future leaks _ is 
generally addressed as soon as the system is in place. ``We always 
recommend a 24-hour pressure test,'' he said, adding that the test 
is to make certain that all the fittings are tight and that the installer 
didn't inadvertently staple through one of the tubes. Of course, there 
is one other factor to be considered when contemplating the installation 
of radiant heat: the cost. ``It's not a low-budget option,'' said 
Aris Crist, an architect in Greenwich, Conn. In most cases, he said, 
installation of a radiant-heating system will cost one-and-a-half 
to two times more than a conventional hot-water baseboard system. 
And though similar boilers can be used for either system, he said, 
the increased expense is attributable to the cost of high-quality 
tubing and the mixing valves used to regulate the temperature of individual 
circuits. While the additional expense is often recovered over time 
in reduced energy costs, Crist said, saving money is generally not 
the primary motivation for installing a hydronic system. ``People 
who have experienced the benefits of a hydronic system firsthand,'' 
he said, ``will usually find the money in their budget to install 
one.''
