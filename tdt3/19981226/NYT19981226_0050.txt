The New York National Boat Show, now in its 87th year, looks more 
like a stage production than a sales arena each season. Complete with 
an indoor small boat pond, Twiggy the water-skiing squirrel and cooking 
classes on a two-burner stove, there is entertainment galore at the 
Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. But alas, the organizers take the 
sale of boats and their attendant marine products very seriously. 
Statistics from the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the 
industry trade group, recently estimated that consumers spent $19billion 
on boats and marine products in 1998. The show in New York marks the 
beginning of the industry's new year. With four football fields worth 
of powerboat and sailboat merchandise on display from Jan. 2-10 at 
the Javits Center, consumers will have plenty of choices. But only 
certain sectors of the industry are very likely to reap the benefits 
of a public flush with buying power. ``There's no question that most 
of the small-boat end of business is pretty lackluster,'' Greg Proteau, 
a spokesman for the manufacturers association, said recently from 
Chicago. ``But if you look at the big stuff, that's where all the 
action is. The number of new inboard boats sold in 1998 increased 
by 9 percent to 13,900 from the previous year. Canoes, inflatable 
boats and water-ski boats were up too. But bass boats were down. The 
market's very segmented.'' Proteau said that an overall decline of 
10 percent in the number of new boats sold in 1998 reflects a ``very 
discriminating public in terms of products that fit their needs.'' 
Manufacturers are not worried about spending; they are concerned about 
directing it their way, he added. On display beginning next weekend 
will be a plethora of boat designs _ more than 1,000 on site _ at 
the New York show. About 85 percent of the craft are powerboats, and 
the remaining 15 percent, sail. More than 100,000 people traipsed 
through the 1997 show, a substantial turnout spurred on by unseasonably 
mild weather. Organizers hope for a similar influx next week. ``Last 
year, people who came to the show were buying at a rate better than 
anything we had seen in the previous seven or eight years,'' Michael 
Duffy, the boat show manager, said recently. ``But no one in the industry 
likes to talk about it being the beginning of a new boom. These guys 
hold their cards close to the chest. If they compare sales to the 
high of 1988, they're afraid the bottom's going to fall out.'' Old-timers 
such as Crusader Engines, which has been exhibiting its line of inboard 
gasoline engines at the New York show since 1954, is clearly cautious. 
``The industry has not made it easy for people,'' said Bill Balsley, 
director of sales and marketing for Crusader. ``This should be an 
industry where it's fun for people to buy. There should be more boat 
rendezvous for owners, and more open houses to help people stay involved, 
to encourage them to buy the next new model the way the automotive 
industry sells its cars.'' The oldest boat exhibitor at the New York 
show is Chris-Craft, the motorboat company that built its reputation 
at the turn-of-the-century with mahogany runabouts. Now owned by Outboard 
Marine Corp., Chris-Craft is reinventing itself for its 125th anniversary 
this season. ``Chris-Craft is definitely on the comeback trail,'' 
Andy Larsen, a spokesman for OMC said recently. Its new models, which 
range from about 20-32 feet, are made of fiberglass now. But the boats 
are built with attention to detail such as rosewood dash panels and 
gold-trimmed gauges. On display in New York will be the 320 Express, 
a 32-foot inboard that can be purchased with twin 280-horsepower Volvo 
Penta engines for about $127,000. Other boats being exhibited will 
be the 40-foot Super Sport, a deep-water cruising and fishing boat 
by Ocean Yachts; the Pilot 30 Sedan, a trawler built for cruising 
by Mainship; the X-26 Tigercat, a sport-fishing catamaran by Grady-White, 
and the Lxi Classic 206, a runabout built by Larson. Besides merchandise 
displays, show customers can choose from more than 35 seminars on 
boating, fishing and water skiing. Raffles will give away numerous 
prizes, including a Hunter 170 daysailer and an Armada B28 Marada, 
a futuristic-looking outboard. For additional show information, telephone
