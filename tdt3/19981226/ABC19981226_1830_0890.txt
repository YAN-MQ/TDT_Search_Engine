President Clinton is calling for a crackdown on drunk drivers. In 
his weekly radio address today, he urged adoption of a national blood 
alcohol limit, 0.08%. This year I worked with members of Congress 
to make 0.08 the law of the land. Tragically the special interests 
blocked this life saving measure. I am determined to succeed in setting 
a 0.08 standard in the new year. Most states aren't as tough and have 
a higher legal limit than that.
