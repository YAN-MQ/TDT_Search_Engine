The driver of a bus involved in a fatal accident in New Jersey Thursday 
says he was trying to avoid a patch of ice when he lost control. The 
bus -- on its way from Brooklyn, New York, to Atlantic City -- plunged 
down an embankment on the garden state parkway, killing 8 people and 
injuring 15. Police say the driver's account of the crash is consistent 
with those given by witnesses. Investigators say they plan to examine 
the bus and the road conditions further, and test the driver for drugs 
and alcohol.
