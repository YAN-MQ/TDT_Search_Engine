The Israeli government should implement the Wye River peace accord 
because it signed it, Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday 
after a meeting between Egyptian and Palestinian leaders. ``We expect 
the United States to put pressure (on Israel) toward implementing 
this agreement,'' especially the part concerning a withdrawal of Israeli 
troops from the West Bank, Moussa said. Speaking after a series of 
talks between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat, Moussa said the Israeli handling of the agreement brokered 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton in October had created a bad impression. 
Israel's image, Moussa said, was one of ``when I negotiate, I negotiate 
to waste time and, if I sign, don't believe that I will implement 
and, when the time for implementation comes, we will hinder it.'' 
``The Israeli government is supposed to implement the Wye River accord 
because it is the government that signed the agreement,'' the foreign 
minister said. On Dec. 2, Israel announced it was freezing the accord 
because of what it alleged were Palestinian violations. It also refused 
to go ahead with scheduled troop pullbacks from the West Bank unless 
the Palestinians met certain conditions, including foregoing a plan 
to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state in May 1999. On Saturday, 
Mubarak and Arafat met one-on-one and then held a meeting accompanied 
by their officials. The two leaders also broke their fast together 
after sunset. Muslims are currently fasting for the holy month of 
Ramadan. Neither of the leaders spoke after the talks, but Moussa 
quoted Arafat as saying that a failure to implement the accord could 
``disturb'' the peace process. Moussa said that, at Mubarak's suggestion, 
further Egyptian-Palestinian meetings would be held in Cairo Saturday 
at official level. The Palestinian Cabinet demanded Friday that Israel 
lift its suspension of the accord, saying that the Israeli election 
campaign was no reason to freeze the process.
