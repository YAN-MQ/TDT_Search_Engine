Hundreds of TWA passengers were stranded at the St. Louis airport 
this christmas, reportedly because of a "mass sickout." "The St. Louis 
post dispatch" reports, many of the airline's flight attendants called 
in sick to protest the lack of a new labor contract. That forced TWA 
to cancel more than 90 flights. An airline spokesman says TWA found 
hotel rooms for stranded passengers. He says service should return 
to normal today.
