Some vitamins and dietary supplements claim to make major improvements 
in your life. Many say you'll lose weight or become fit and strong. 
Now, the federal government wants such claims substantiated. It's 
issuing guidelines to regulate what manufacturers say their products 
can and cannot do. For example, if a product says that University 
studies prove a certain health claim, the federal trade commission 
says it had better be prepared to show those studies. Or if a product 
calls itself "cold away," and says it helps "maintain a Healthy nose 
and throat during the winter," advertisers had better be able to back 
up those claims. And it's not just the words manufacturers use, it's 
the pictures, too. We're looking at the net impression. We're looking 
at the images you use, the product name, the visuals. Everything put 
together creates an impression, and consumers take away meaning from 
that. But the market is too big for the government to be able to police 
every claim. So, the bottom line remains, Buyer beware. Check out 
CNN.com/health for the latest health news online.
