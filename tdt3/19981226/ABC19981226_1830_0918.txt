Every year, cleaning up toxic waste costs taxpayers millions of dollars. 
It's not only an expensive process, it's a slow process. But now there's 
a way to do it faster and cheaper. ABC's Jack Smith has details. For 
years, poisonous chemicals at this site in California's central valley 
slowly leaked into the groundwater. It stinks and we really don't 
want to smell it too long. This is highly toxic? Yes, sir, it's toxic. 
Creosote was used here by the phone company as a preservative for 
its telephone poles, making the site one of the most polluted and 
hard to clean in the country. But now a brand-new technology invented 
by the Lawrence Livermore national labs is changing that. Were you 
surprised when you saw how effective this new technology was? I'm 
thrilled. You're thrilled? Absolutely thrilled. In just its first 
12 weeks of operation, this new cleanup technology removed some 50,000 
gallons of pollutants from the ground here. Using traditional methods, 
it would have taken 120 years to get that much out of the soil. This 
is the steam under the ground? That's correct. 100 feet under the 
ground? 100 feet under the ground. Guided by the same sort of magnetic 
imaging used in medicine, engineers first heat water in giant boilers. 
Then, driving pipes 100 feet underground, literally surround the pollution, 
soften it with superhot steam and force it to the surface. We're bringing 
the steam, the groundwater and the contaminants to the center. And 
then, we have a network of Wells that extract it all out of the ground. 
If the cleanup is finished in two years, it will save $55 million. 
And if the technology works here, it could be applied to thousands 
of other highly polluted sites. If you go to a site where, potentially, 
they were going to be pumping and treating for 80 more years, and 
southern California Edison and the regulators can bring this site 
to closure within a couple of years and get it off their books, that 
is revolutionary. Not a term scientists use lightly, but here they 
mean it. This technology could revolutionize toxic waste cleanup everywhere.
