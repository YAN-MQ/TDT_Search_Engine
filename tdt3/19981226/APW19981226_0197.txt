President Suleyman Demirel on Saturday said he disapproved of a government 
bid to abolish the death penalty to gain the extradition from Italy 
of a Kurdish rebel leader, who is wanted here on terrorism charges. 
``Turkey is not ready for the lifting of the death penalty,'' Demirel 
told reporters in a year-end news conference. The government has drafted 
a bill to replace the death penalty with life in prison. The aim is 
to win the extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of a 14-year-old 
Kurdish guerrilla war for autonomy in southeast Turkey. Italian law 
forbids extradition of anyone who might face capital punishment. Demirel 
said the lifting of the death penalty for Ocalan's extradition was 
a ``grave condition.'' He referred to public outrage against Ocalan, 
who is blamed in Turkey for the death of thousands of people. Turkey 
has not carried out any executions since 1984 despite issuing death 
sentences. Ocalan, who showed up in Italy on a flight from Moscow 
last month, has been looking for a safe country to go since Syria 
expelled him in October in response to heavy pressure from Turkey. 
Estonia, Ukraine, Libya and North Korea had been mentioned in news 
reports as possible destinations. Ocalan, who has asked Italy for 
political asylum, has been staying in a villa near Rome while his 
future is decided. Some 37,000 people have died in the conflict since 
Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party launched a guerrilla war for autonomy 
in 1984.
