People ventured out onto the sunny streets of a besieged central Angolan 
city Saturday despite a rebel bombardment pummeling the northern outskirts, 
a Roman Catholic bishop said. ``People have come out for a walk,'' 
Bishop Jose Nambi said in a telephone interview from Kuito. ``They're 
taking the risk.'' Kuito has been the center of fighting between UNITA 
rebels and the Angolan army for nearly a month. On Thursday, rebels 
launched their heaviest attack yet on the city in the renewed fighting, 
killing 30 people and wounding 37 others. Both sides have launched 
intense attacks in the central highlands of the vast southwest African 
country, undermining a 1994 U.N.-brokered peace accord aimed at ending 
a two-decade civil war. Nambi said rebels on Saturday targeted the 
village of Cunji, on the northern outskirts of Kuito, which is 300 
miles (480 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Luanda. Kuito's hospital 
has little medicine, and newly wounded people _ mostly civilians _ 
are admitted every day, Nambi said. Observers fear a humanitarian 
crisis as stocks run low. Relief agencies have stopped flying to Kuito 
because the airport has been targeted by rebel artillery to prevent 
the government sending in reinforcements. Kuito's population of about 
100,000 has been swollen with a further 30,000 displaced in the past 
two weeks. People have taken refuge in the hospital, in churches, 
abandoned houses _ even under balconies. ``It's very tough for the 
displaced in terms of food,'' said the bishop, speaking from a seminary 
that has offered shelter to some refugees. ``(They) left everything 
behind, and there isn't enough medicine, or blankets to go round.'' 
Civil war between the government and UNITA broke out in 1975 after 
Angola's independence from Portugal. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the 
following year when UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat 
in Angola's first elections. Before the 1994 U.N.-brokered cease-fire, 
Kuito was reduced to rubble in a yearlong siege that ended when government 
forces ousted UNITA rebels. The 1994 pact required UNITA to disarm 
and hand over control of almost half the country it effectively ruled. 
UNITA claimed it had disarmed and demobilized its forces under U.N. 
supervision over the past four years. However, the rebels are estimated 
to have about 30,000 guerrilla soldiers still hidden in the bush. 
The government army has 100,000 soldiers.
