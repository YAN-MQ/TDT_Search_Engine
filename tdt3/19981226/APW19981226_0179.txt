A Russian policeman held hostage in Chechnya was released Saturday 
in exchange for a Chechen prisoner being held in Russia, a news report 
said. Sergei Khalansky, a 41-year-old police inspector in the southern 
Russian town of Grazhdanskoye, was kidnapped June 9 and taken to the 
breakaway Chechnya region, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Khalansky's 
abductors demanded a large ransom, but in a deal worked out by Alexander 
Lebed, Khalansky was exchanged for a Chechen prisoner being held in 
Russia. No details were given about the Chechen prisoner. Lebed, a 
retired general who negotiated the end to Chechnya's 1994-96 independence 
war with Russia, has helped in the release of Russian hostages. He 
is considered a top contender for Russia's 2000 presidential elections. 
Hostage-taking for ransom has become a booming business in Chechnya, 
a small Caucasus region awash in violence and crime since the end 
of the war. More than a hundred Russian and foreign hostages are believed 
to still be held there.
