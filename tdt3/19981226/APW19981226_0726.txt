Almost Australian dollars 500 million (U.S. dlrs 315 million) was 
spent on production and post production services for the year to the 
end of June 1998, up from Australian dollars 410 million (U.S. dlrs 
258 million) in 1996-97 and Australian dollars 375 million (U.S. dlrs 
236 million) the year before. The boom in production follows an influx 
of Australians into mainstream film making _ most obviously the Oscars 
won by ``Shine'' star Geoffrey Rush and ``Babe'' director George Miller. 
Australian faces such as those of actors Rush, Russell Crow and Cate 
Blanchett and directors Miller, Philip Noyce and Peter Weir are no 
longer strangers to Hollywood. Newcomers such as Baz Luhrmann, director 
of ``William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet,'' and ``Dark City's'' 
Alex Proyas may be seen as a second wave. Some local filmmakers, however, 
fear greater numbers of big overseas productions will shut out local 
producers by pushing up costs and draining the talent pool of local 
crews.
