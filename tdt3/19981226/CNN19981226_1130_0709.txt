Today marks the beginning of the seven-day African-American celebration 
of kwanzaa. The nonreligious holiday was created 32 years ago, and 
honors black heritage and pride. It's based on African winter harvest 
festivals. Each day, a candle is lit and a different principle -- 
such as unity, self-determination and creativity -- is celebrated. 
During the festival, parents typically give their children three gifts 
-- a Book to further a goal or highlight black achievement, a heritage 
symbol and a toy.
