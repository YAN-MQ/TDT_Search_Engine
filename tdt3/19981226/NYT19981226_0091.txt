Summoning a somber image of unopened packages beneath a Christmas 
tree (``presents for a child killed by a drunk driver''), President 
Clinton on Saturday promised to renew his Administration's fight against 
drunken driving in the New Year. ``For a generation, drunk-driving 
has been one of America's greatest public-safety challenges,'' Clinton 
said in his weekly radio address in announcing new steps by the Justice 
and Transportation departments. Clinton said he would try again to 
gain passage of a nationwide .08 blood-alcohol standard for drunken 
driving. Congress rejected that proposal last May as it passed a transportation 
bill, and safety groups accused lawmakers of capitulating to the liquor 
lobby. The president promised grants to states and other incentives 
to enforce laws against drinking by minors; to reinforce programs 
to prevent drunken driving, and to pass and enforce strong state highway-safety 
legislation. ``With alcohol flowing at parties and millions of families 
taking to the road to see friends and relatives, the holiday season 
can also be a season of tragedy,'' Clinton said. ``Last December, 
more than 1,300 Americans lost their lives in alcohol-related crashes.'' 
The statistics are not all disheartening, he said, noting that the 
number of people killed in alcohol-related crashes dropped to an all-time 
low in 1997. Last year, for the first time since the government began 
keeping track in 1975, alcohol was involved in fewer than 40 percent 
of all traffic deaths. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 
part of the Transportation Department, reported in August that alcohol-related 
traffic fatalities totaled 16,189 in 1997, down 1,029, or 6 percent, 
from 1996. But Clinton said there was much more to be done. ``The 
most effective action we can take to make our roads safer is to set 
the national impaired-driving standard at .08 percent blood-alcohol 
content,'' he said. ``No one will ever doubt that a person with that 
much blood alcohol is unfit to drive after meeting Brenda Frazier.'' 
Mrs. Frazier, of Westminster, Md., appeared at the White House last 
March to back Clinton's call for a nationwide .08 standard. She recalled 
watching as her 9-year-old daughter was killed by a car driven by 
a man whose blood-alcohol level was exactly .08 percent. Sixteen states 
and the District of Columbia have adopted the .08 standard, while 
most other states, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, 
have a .10 standard. While individual reactions to alcohol vary, a 
170-pound man with an empty stomach would reach the .08 level by consuming 
four 8-ounce glasses of beer in an hour. A 137-pound woman with an 
empty stomach would reach that level by downing three glasses of beer 
in an hour. ``It am determined to succeed in setting a .08 standard 
in the New Year,'' Clinton said. ``It's the right thing to do.''
