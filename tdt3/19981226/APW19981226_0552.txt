A Yemeni tribal leader said Saturday that the German Embassy had offered 
2 million riyals (dlrs 16,000) for the release of four hostages, but 
the German Foreign Ministry denied the claim. A leader of the Bani 
Dhabyan tribe, which has kidnapped four Germans, said German Ambassador 
Helga Strathwitz made the offer through intermediaries earlier this 
week. The tribe had rejected the ransom as it does not meet their 
demands, the leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 
Bani Dhabyan are pressing the government to provide more schools, 
hospitals, telephone lines and roads for their province of Marib, 
170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a. In Bonn late Saturday, 
the German foreign ministry denied that its embassy in San`a had offered 
any ransom. Bani Dhabyan gunmen abducted the Germans, three women 
and a man, on Dec. 7 in Marib. The tribal leader said that Strathwitz 
had expressed concern for the health of the hostages, especially a 
women who is sick, and had asked for their immediate release. A Yemeni 
newspaper has identified the hostages as Norbert Degen, Petra Penglista, 
Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner. The embassy has not confirmed the 
names. The tribal leader said the health of 64-year-old Brunner, who 
suffers from high blood pressure, is deteriorating. A German-speaking 
cardiologist dispatched Sunday to examine her was not able to reach 
the isolated area where the hostages are being held and has returned 
to San`a, the leader said. But he said the hostages received medicine 
for Brunner along with Christmas gifts of chocolates and cigarettes 
from the embassy Thursday. Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, 
large parts of which are controlled by armed tribesmen who do not 
hesitate to take the law into their hands to get their demands fulfilled. 
The hostages are usually treated well and released unhurt.
