Fugitive Saudi billionaire osama bin laden is urging Muslims to attack 
american and British citizens to avenge the latest air strikes against 
iraq. In a London-based Arabic newspaper, bin laden is quoted as saying, 
"every muslim should confront and fight them. Anything that could 
be taken from them by force is a prize for the muslims." The U.S. 
has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to bin laden's 
arrest in connection with last summer's twin terrorist bombings on 
U.S. embassies in Africa.
