With cracked ribs and an injured spleen, 72-year-old Louis Weiss was 
``sore all over'' on Saturday. Yet he told his doctors at Robert Wood 
Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., to release him 
by Sunday morning. He has to bury his wife. Louis and Shirley Weiss 
were one of four couples ripped apart on the road on Christmas Eve 
when the bus they were riding from Brooklyn for a day of gambling 
in Atlantic City hurtled off the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey 
and flipped several times before landing at the bottom of an embankment. 
Shirley, 70, was among the eight people killed, most of whom are to 
be buried Sunday. Louis was among the 15 _ including the driver, Valentin 
Viner _ who were hospitalized with injuries, many of them critical. 
``I wish people would tell me this is a dream,'' Weiss said, choking 
back sobs and then letting them run free, crying openly into the telephone 
during an interview from his hospital room. ``I was hoping that God 
would help me,'' said Weiss, who, like most of the victims, is Jewish. 
``Every Saturday I prayed to Him in synagogue. I guess He didn't hear 
my pleas.'' Louis said that he and Shirley had been married 46 years. 
They have two children and four grandchildren, who live in New Jersey. 
He was an accountant, she stayed home with the children. For the last 
five or six years, they had visited Atlantic City about once a month, 
joining other retirees on the buses that depart daily from Brooklyn, 
picking up passengers at corner stores and ferrying them to the shining 
lights of the casinos and the fresh ocean breeze of the boardwalk. 
``My wife and I were partners, always, in the slot machines,'' Louis 
Weiss recalled Saturday. ``We had a lot of fun putting in four, five, 
six nickels. ``Sure we won,'' he said. ``But they took it back.'' 
At the two-family gray-brick rowhouse where the Weisses have lived 
for four decades, marigolds line the front garden. Neighbors said 
that Louis, a World War II veteran, is active in the Knights of Pythias 
and in his shul on Avenue O. Shirley was like an aunt to her neighbor's 
grandchildren. Weiss said he and his wife were sitting next to each 
other, watching the Steve Martin movie ``Roxanne'' on the bus video 
screen, until the accident happened. Weiss said Viner is ``a good 
driver,'' but that he ``must have been going a little too fast.'' 
``Maybe someone cut him off, I don't know,'' Weiss said. ``He flew 
off the highway.'' N.J. state police investigators said Viner told 
them he lost control of the bus when he swerved to avoid a patch of 
ice. Other witnesses, including two passengers and a driver who was 
behind the doomed bus, have said that Viner was speeding. The National 
Transportation Safety Board plans to begin reconstructing the accident 
Monday. George Black, a highway engineer who sits on the NTSB, said 
in an interview Saturday that questions about whether the guardrails 
were up to standard and whether anti-lock brakes might have helped 
prevent the fatal crash are among those that will be considered. The 
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials 
has deisgn policies specifying the appropriate height and length of 
guardrails, Black said. But because the Garden State Parkway not part 
of the federal highway system, it is not necessarily required to meet 
the group's standards. The bus, a 1992 Vanhool, probably was not equipped 
with anti-lock brakes, which are only required on buses manufactured 
after March 1998, Black said. Such brakes, known as ABS, improve braking 
efficiency and likely would have helped the bus maintain stability 
if it hit a patch of ice as the driver swerved, Black said. ``ABS 
brakes on large vehicles, small vehicles, any vehicle, always helps 
the driver maintain control,'' he explained. ``Whether, in this particular 
accident it would have helped enough, we won't know until we reconstruct 
the accident.'' If the bus had ABS, Black said, it probably would 
not have spun around as quickly. Had it still tumbled off the road, 
the slower rotation might have kept it from rolling over repeatedly, 
reducing the severity of the crash. Viner, 52, emigrated from Moscow, 
where he was a pilot, about a decade ago, said a friend, Sarah Peregrina. 
Neither he nor his lawyer could be reached Saturday. Speaking in fragments, 
as much from the shock of remembering the horror as from the shot 
of pain medication he had just received, Weiss had only a hazy half-recollection 
of events when he spoke of the accident Saturday morning. ``Hydroplaning,'' 
he said. ``Like I had wings. The bus took off. ``That was my last 
memory, until I was laying on the floor, with my wife next to me,'' 
he continued between bouts of sobs. ``She was gone. I tried to wake 
her. But I couldn't. ``I protected my wife,'' he said. ``But it was 
too late. She flew off.''
