On a bend in the picturesque Napa River, local philanthropists and 
artists have joined forces to create an elite boarding school devoted 
to art. Named the Oxbow School, its first class will arrive for a 
semester beginning next September. The class will be made up of 48 
juniors drawn from private and public high schools around the country. 
The education takes an innovative approach in which every class _ 
not just art but history and English, math and science _ will be led 
by both a teacher and a visiting artist. ``It puts the artists in 
contact with the students up close and every day,'' said the school's 
director, Stephen Thomas, a printmaker and until recently an art teacher 
and administrator at the Urban School in San Francisco, a private 
high school. ``We will offer the artists whatever support they need,'' 
Thomas added, ``but it's the artists who will decide what they want 
to do during their time here. That freedom is essential.'' Students 
and visiting artists will live in two apartment buildings next to 
the school, which will have four studios. Ann Hamilton, Buster Simpson 
and William Jackson Maxwell will be among the first participating 
artists. All are known for their outdoor site installations. The artistic 
focus for the first term will draw on the school's location along 
the Napa River, which regularly floods in winter. Napa residents earlier 
this year approved a flood-control program to let the river reclaim 
adjacent lands, rather than contain it in diversion channels. And 
though the river rehabilitation program will not begin for several 
years, the students will use it as an artistic theme. Oxbow's is not 
the first semesterlong boarding school program with a theme. In 1984 
the Mountain School in Vershire, Vt., was opened by the Milton Academy 
of Milton, Mass., for students to study the environment. More recent 
programs include the Maine Coast Semester in Wicasset, Me., and Cityterm 
at the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. The idea for Oxbow came 
from Ann Hatch, who since the 1970s has been a major contributor to 
the arts in San Francisco. Ms. Hatch started the Capp Street Project, 
an artists-in-residence program, and she serves on the board of the 
San Francisco Art Institute. Ms. Hatch paid $2.5 million for the properties 
that make up the campus. Her partners in Oxbow are the Napa Valley 
vintner Robert Mondavi and his wife, Margrit Biever Mondavi. The Mondavis 
have been working for several years on an American Center for Wine, 
Food and the Arts, which will be across the river from the school. 
The Mondavis donated $6 million, $4 million of which is paying for 
the buildings and $2 million for an endowment to pay tuition for local 
children. The aim is to have one-third of the students each term coming 
from schools around Napa. ``By supporting local students financially 
through the endowment,'' Mrs. Mondavi said, ``then the community understands 
how much commitment there is to the project. Otherwise people in the 
community would just think, `Oh, they're putting in a school for the 
rich.' By doing it this way, everybody has a chance.''
