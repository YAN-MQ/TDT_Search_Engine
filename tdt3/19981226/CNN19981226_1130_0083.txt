It's an old-time Christmas holiday for hundreds of thousands in the 
southeastern U.S. this year, as candles and fireplaces replace electricity 
knocked out by ice storms. Virginia was hardest hit, with nearly 200,000 
customers without power last night. Utility crews are scrambling to 
restore service across the region. The weather has also caused havoc 
on streets and highways. Slick roads have been blamed for at least 
14 highway deaths. Forecasters aren't calling for more freezing rain, 
but say the cold snap will probably continue.
