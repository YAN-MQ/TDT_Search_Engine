After a bout with the flu and the demands of Christmas appearances, 
Pope John Paul II on Saturday bantered with pilgrims as he began a 
brief holiday in the Alban hills southeast of Rome. Following celebration 
of a Christmas Eve midnight Mass, which lasted into the early hours 
of Friday, and then another appearance to the public gathered in St. 
Peter's Square at noon on Christmas day, John Paul scheduled a late 
morning helicopter flight Saturday for Castel Gandolfo, a lakeside 
hilltown which hosts the papal holiday retreat. ``Merry Christmas, 
Castel Gandolfo,'' the pope joked after giving his blessing to pilgrims 
and tourists in the courtyard of the 17th-century palace. John Paul, 
who is to spend a few days in the hilltown, seemed rested and in good 
spirits in the crisp, sunny day. On Dec. 18, the Vatican announced 
that the pope had canceled some private audiences because of a light 
flu and fever.
