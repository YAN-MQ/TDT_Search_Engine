This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News" weather update. 
An area of low pressure will continue moving off the east coast as 
a cold front moves through the Great Lakes and New England. Scattered 
snow showers are possible as this frontal system heads eastward. Also, 
look for a reinforcing shot of cold air to move in from Canada, as 
a New cold front pushes into the dakotas by Sunday. Two areas of low 
pressure in the west will cause snow showers for the rockies and rain 
along the pacific northwest coast. High temperatures will be moderating 
in most of the south with 40s, 50s and 60s on tap. Southern Florida 
will see temperatures in the 70s. It remains cold across the north 
with temperatures in the single digits, teens, 20s and 30s from the 
northeast coast through the Rockies. The extended forecast includes 
heavy rain and snow in the northwest Monday, snowfall across New England 
and a mix of rain and snow for the Ohio and tennessee river valleys. 
Tuesday, you'll see heavy rain moving to the mid-atlantic coast with 
showers and a few thunderstorms in the extreme southern portions of 
florida. Look for heavy rain to continue in the west. That changes 
to a mix by Wednesday. The extended forecast for more than 7,000 cities 
is at CNN.com.
