Opposition leaders accused President Alexander Lukashenko of violating 
the Belarusian constitution by agreeing to merge his country with 
Russia as early as next year. President Boris Yeltsin and Lukashenko 
agreed in a Kremlin meeting Friday to put the proposed merger up for 
public discussion by mid-1999. Without waiting for popular approval, 
they will also move early next year to introduce a single currency 
and harmonize taxes, they said. Members of the former elected parliament, 
which Lukashenko dissolved two years ago, and opposition party leaders 
issued a joint statement Saturday criticizing the Russian-Belarusian 
agreement. They said that Lukashenko was motivated in part by a desire 
to avoid national elections, which are scheduled for next year. ``Lukashenko 
is afraid of free elections. That's why he is going to surrender our 
country's independence, in hopes of acquiring supreme power in the 
united state,'' the statement said. Mechislav Grib, a retired, high-ranking 
police officer and former parliamentary speaker, said the agreement 
violated seven articles of Belarus' constitution. ``Lukashenko's actions 
are illegal, and the agreement in the juridical sense is written in 
sand,'' Grib said. Lukashenko, an admirer of the Soviet Union, has 
long pushed for uniting his nation of 10 million people with Russia's 
147 million people. He and Yeltsin signed the first union agreement 
in 1996, boosting political, economic and military ties between the 
two nations, but stopping short of creating one state. The two leaders 
have long pledged to take further integration steps but have in fact 
done little. It remains unclear whether Friday's agreements will be 
implemented, as many Russian politicians oppose merging their already 
poor country with even poorer Belarus. Russian liberals and the West 
have assailed Lukashenko for his crackdown on the opposition and the 
independent media. Russian Communists and other hardliners publicly 
hail the proposed merger, but tacitly oppose it, fearing that Lukashenko 
would push them to the sidelines if he were to join Russia's presidential 
race in 2000.
