Russia will not go hungry in 1999, and there will be no food shortages 
in spite of Russia's agricultural crisis, a top Russian official declared 
in an interview published Saturday. Deputy Prime Minister Gennady 
Kulik painted a grim picture of decline in the agricultural sector. 
Prices of agricultural products haven't kept pace with the astronomically 
rising prices of inputs such as feed, energy and manure. Farmers have 
been forced to cut back production, leading to shortages of domestically 
produced food including meat. ``If in 1990 we had about half a cow 
per person, now we have one-quarter that number,'' Kulik told the 
Komsomolskaya Pravda daily. He said that the August financial crisis, 
which erupted when the government defaulted on short-term debts and 
the ruble's value plummeted, had only accelerated the nation's food-production 
troubles. The cost of Russia's tremendous dependence on imported food 
skyrocketed. ``There couldn't be a stable situation when a huge country 
was receiving grub from abroad, waving away its domestic producers,'' 
Kulik was quoted as saying. ``On the contrary, a powerful agricultural 
sector stimulates development of the whole economy.'' Kulik said that 
the government had taken measures to ensure there would not be food 
shortages in 1999. Its primary task is to keep the food market running 
at the same level as in 1998, he said. ``We're depending in part on 
growth in domestic production _ for example, in poultry,'' he said. 
The government has cut import taxes on meat, poultry feed and edible 
oils to keep up food supplies, Kulik said. He added that plans were 
being developed to support domestic producers, including citizens 
who grow food on garden plots.
