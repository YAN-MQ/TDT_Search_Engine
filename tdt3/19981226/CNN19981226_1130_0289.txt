Two of the three remaining major leaders of the Khmer Rouge have defected 
to the Cambodian government. The political chief and leader of the 
rebel group say they now want to live as "ordinary citizens." The 
Cambodian prime minister negotiated the defection, which experts say 
amounts to a surrender. We have had communications between the Khmer 
Rouge leader, and the number two man under Pol Pot. The communications 
have been with the men who have been at large. They have expressed 
their will to live as free men in government controlled areas to give 
up their lives as rebel leaders in the jungle. It's now being approved 
by the prime minister. An international court will apparently decide 
whether the pair will be tried for genocide, nearly 2 million Cambodians 
were killed during their reign of terror during the 1970s.
