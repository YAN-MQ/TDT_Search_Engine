Pakistan, one of the world's newest nuclear powers, rejected a unilateral 
moratorium on fissile material used to make nuclear bombs Saturday. 
``Given our genuine security concerns, we cannot agree to any demand 
for a moratorium on the production of fissile materials unilaterally 
or multilaterally,'' Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told the National 
Assembly or powerful lawmaking Lower House of Parliament. Both Pakistan 
and India exploded underground nuclear tests last May, declared themselves 
nuclear powers and generated global fears of a nuclear arms race on 
the Asian subcontinent, a volatile region that already has seen three 
wars in the last 51 years. Aziz says the United States and other western 
countries have asked Pakistan to declare an early moratorium on the 
production of fissile material. But Aziz says Pakistan has concerns 
about India's stockpile of fissile material, as well as stockpiles 
worldwide. ``We believe that a fissile material treaty should be an 
instrument promoting both nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament,'' 
Aziz said. ``When the substantive negotiations start on Fissile Material 
Cut-off Treaty in Geneva next year, Pakistan will pursue its position, 
which is shared by a majority of the non-aligned countries.'' Both 
India and Pakistan are under fierce pressure from the international 
community to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, something Pakistan 
already has expressed a willingness to do. International sanctions 
imposed following the underground tests were relaxed after Pakistan 
indicated it would sign the test ban treaty. However, the Pakistan 
government has been steadfast in its refusal to sign the pact ending 
the production of fissile material.
