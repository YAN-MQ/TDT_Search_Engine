Maj. Gen. Charles Mize, a combat veteran of three wars who won the 
Navy Cross with the 1st Marine Division in the Korean War and was 
the division's commander a quarter-century later, died on Dec. 10 
at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Alexandria, Va. Mize was 77 and lived 
in Falls Church, Va. The cause was pneumonia, his family said. Mize 
wanted to be a country lawyer, but he was a Marine for 32 years, fighting 
in epic campaigns from the battle for Okinawa in World War II, to 
the retreat from the Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War, to the rescue 
of troops in the Mekong Delta in the Vietnam War. Mize and his son 
Maj. Gen. David Mize, commander of the Marine Forces Reserve, were 
the sixth father and son in Marine Corps history to have both worn 
a general's stars. Charles Davis Mize, whose father was a farmer, 
was born in Cave Spring, Ga., and joined the Marines after graduating 
from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1944. Serving as a rifle platoon leader 
on Okinawa in April 1945, in the last great battle of the war in the 
Pacific, he was shot in the upper arm by a Japanese soldier he was 
flushing out of a cave. Early in August 1950, five weeks after North 
Korean forces crossed the 38th Parallel and captured Seoul, the South 
Korean capital, Lt. Mize arrived in the port of Pusan with elements 
of the 1st Marine Division sent from California to bolster besieged 
Army troops. Serving with Company G of the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine 
Regiment, Mize took part in defending the Pusan perimeter and in the 
amphibious landing at Inchon, operations that led to the drive to 
recapture Seoul. Taking over Company G after its commander was wounded, 
Mize was shot through the leg while battling North Korean troops in 
the hills northwest of Seoul. Later, after heavy fighting in the streets 
of Seoul, he and his men stormed the grounds of the Capitol, which 
had housed the South Korean National Assembly. Marines tore down North 
Korean flags flying over its dome and ran up American flags, then 
routed the enemy troops, moving room by room. For his role in the 
retaking of Seoul in late September 1950, Mize was given the Navy 
Cross, the Marines' second-highest award for valor after the Medal 
of Honor. Late in November, Mize was deep inside North Korea at the 
mountain village of Yudam-ni, near the Chosin Reservoir, when Communist 
Chinese troops entered the war, threatening to annihilate American 
forces that were approaching the border with China. Only 40 marines 
were left in Company G, and they were exhausted, hungry and suffering 
greatly in the subzero cold. But Mize roused them with a pep talk 
that he recalled decades later in an interview with the military historian 
John Toland for his book ``In Mortal Combat'' (Morrow, 1991). ``We 
are in a hell of a mess,'' he recalled telling his men. ``But you 
and I together have gone through many battles. We've always done the 
job and I know we can do it again.'' His men made it to the port of 
Hungnam in a retreat in which thousands of Marines overcame the frigid 
Korean winter on a 10-day, 70-mile journey, taking their wounded with 
them and inflicting heavy casualties. Mize was awarded the Bronze 
Star for his actions in the evacuation. He saw action again, in 1968 
and 1969, serving as operations officer of the IV Corps command in 
the Mekong Delta and winning another Bronze Star for a helicopter 
rescue of wounded troops while under enemy fire. From 1971 to 1973, 
Mize was commander of the Marine Corps base at Quantico, Va. He then 
returned to his old outfit, commanding the 1st Marine Division at 
Camp Pendleton, Calif., in 1975 and 1976. After retiring in 1976, 
Mize was a partner in a home construction firm in northern Virginia. 
Besides his son David Mize, he is survived by his wife, Martha; another 
son, Randy, of San Diego; two daughters, Sally Ekfelt of Falls Church 
and Ann Cuseo of Kailua, Hawaii, and eight grandchildren.
