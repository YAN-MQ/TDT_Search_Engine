The leader of the minority National Democratic Party and its sole 
member of Parliament said Saturday he won't run in upcoming elections. 
Dr. Richie Haynes cited a lack of resources and an inability to gain 
additional seats or significantly affect the outcome of the vote. 
The party, formed in 1989 by members disaffected with the Democratic 
Labor Party, ``was not formed just to be another power-seeking election 
machine, but as a party devoted to the development and promotion of 
values,'' Haynes said. Prime Minister Owen Arthur of the ruling Barbados 
Labor Party is expected to announce the date for the 1999 election 
within days. Arthur's party holds 18 seats in Parliament while the 
opposition Democratic Labor Party holds nine. Haynes holds the remaining 
seat. Polls indicate Arthur will win another term, and Haynes concurred. 
``It is clear the people of Barbados will give strong support to the 
present government,'' he said. University of the West Indies political 
science professor Neville Duncan said Haynes' party didn't have a 
credible shot at becoming the main opposition party and was wise not 
to spend limited resources on the election. Haynes was finance minister 
for the Democratic party in the 1980s but broke away to form his own 
party in 1989.
