Former New Jersey Devils coach Jacques Lemaire has rejoined the Montreal 
Canadiens as a consultant to general manager Rejean Houle. ``Jacques 
will be a real asset to our team,'' Houle said at a news conference 
prior to the Canadiens' game against the Maple Leafs on Saturday night. 
``His knowledge of the league combined with his experience of coaching 
will help me on a daily basis to get a stronger evaluation of our 
own personnel as well as a better evaluation of the current and future 
players of the NHL.'' The 53-year-old Lemaire signed a three-year 
deal with Montreal. Lemaire played his entire 12-year career with 
the Canadiens, winning eight Stanley Cups. He coached the team for 
the last 17 games of the 1983-84 season and the entire 1984-85 season, 
before moving to the front office. Montreal won two more Cups, in 
1986 and 1993, while Lemaire was an assistant GM. He joined the Devils 
in 1993 and was named the league's coach of the year in 1994, before 
leading the club to its only championship in 1994. Lemaire resigned 
at the end of the 1997-98 season when the Devils were ousted in the 
first round of the playoffs after winning the Atlantic Division with 
a 48-23-11 record. With two years remaining on his contract, Lemaire 
had been serving as a scout with the Devils this season. ``The relationship 
that Jacques had with the organization and with me personally has 
been outstanding,'' New Jersey GM Lou Lamoriello said. ``The five 
years he has been here have been just tremendous.'' Houle said his 
team has to deal with major decisions in the near future and Lemaire, 
who will spend most of his time outside Montreal, will be ``a great 
asset around the team.'' Going into their game against the Maple Leafs, 
the Canadiens were on an 11-game winless streak (0-6-5), the club's 
longest since 1935-36, and were last in the Northeast Division with 
an 8-18-7 mark. ``I've been watching the team, mostly on TV, and what 
I see is simple and hard to explain at the same time,'' Lemaire told 
reporters in the corridor outside the Canadiens dressing room. ``It 
is a matter of confidence. ``This team lacks confidence. There are 
good players here, lots of talent, but even if you have talent you 
can't succeed without confidence.''
