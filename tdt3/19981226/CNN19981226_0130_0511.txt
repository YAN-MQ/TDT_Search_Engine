It is a Christmas of hope and remembrance in Jefferson county, Alabama. 
Residents there are trying to rebuild their lives, seven months after 
a Tornado ripped through the town. Aram Roston reports. Shaping up 
so pretty. Elma eatman and her husband Fred took a tour of their unfinished 
new home. The tornado wiped out their old one. And by that time, it 
hit the house. I just slid off the bed -- down between the bed and 
the wall. And it clashed, and it just tore up. It blew our house away. 
And it blew away everything else in its path. More than 30 people 
lost their lives. This was the eatman's neighborhood back then. The 
only buildings there now are new or under construction. The rest is 
rubble in the weeds. Here, in Jefferson county alone, officials say 
almost 450 homes were completely destroyed. Not everyone is rebuilding. 
Some, like the eatmans, will move into their new homes. In their 80s 
they sometimes doubted that they would. Oh, we're just so happy. That'll 
be the best Christmas we've ever had. Most of the young people at 
this church meeting are survivors of this tornado. Twins Amber and 
Ashley think it was a miracle. They were among 70 people at a Wednesday 
night service when the tornado hit. The building around them was torn 
to pieces -- shredded -- somehow leaving them alive. But church members 
say they will rebuild in the new year. Amid the communities' rebirth, 
there is tremendous loss. Henry king rebuilt his house, but the retired 
coal Miner lives there alone. It took them a long time to find the 
bodies. You know, they were just scattered in different places. When 
the storm hit, he was working in a shed behind the house. His family 
was in the house cooking dinner. Well, I lost just about my all my 
family -- my wife, two daughters, granddaughter. In all, he lost six 
members of his family. Everything was carried in the ravine across 
the hill over there. You could see nothing over there. I never will 
be the same. It's hard to think about it when you think the way people 
died. King says some other relatives are visiting with him this holiday 
season. Aram Roston, CNN, Jefferson county, Alabama.
