Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday denied Palestinian charges 
that he suspended the Wye River peace accord because of upcoming elections, 
saying that Palestinian noncompliance is responsible for the freeze. 
Netanyahu told Israel Radio that he would implement the 2-month old 
U.S.-brokered accord once the Palestinians did their part, including 
collecting illegal weapons held by Palestinian police and civilians. 
Netanyahu criticized the Palestinian Authority for releasing Hamas 
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin from house arrest on Wednesday 
and permitting a Palestinian jailed for killing two Israelis to have 
``passed through the revolving door, exited, and escaped outside,'' 
the radio said. The Palestinian Authority was carrying out a manhunt 
for Jamil Jidala who escaped from a Nablus jail earlier this week. 
The Palestinians suggested early elections for prime minister, expected 
by late April, were responsible for the freeze. ``This Israeli government 
continues to be a government, responsible for its commitments,'' chief 
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said after Friday night's meeting 
of the Palestinian Cabinet in the West Bank town of Hebron. The call 
for early elections was triggered by lawmakers' rejection of Netanyahu's 
peace policies, and how and whether to implement the peace pact is 
already a major campaign issue. Israel has refused to go ahead with 
promised troop pull backs from the West Bank unless the Palestinians 
meet a series of conditions. Those include a renunciation of Palestinian 
claims to the right to declare statehood in May 1999 whether or not 
terms have been agreed on with Israel. But the Palestinian Cabinet 
said in a statement following its meeting that it would continue making 
preparations for a statehood declaration in May. The Palestinians 
also said they would seek help from the Arab world and the rest of 
the international community to ``confront the freezing of the peace 
process. The Cabinet called Israeli noncompliance with the accord 
a ``dangerous development which was initiated by the Israeli government 
without any reason besides its rejection of peace.'' Saturday, Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 
Cairo to discuss the frozen agreement.
