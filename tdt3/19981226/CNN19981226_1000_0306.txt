Authorities are trying to determine who threw a teargas canister into 
an overcrowded nightclub on Christmas eve in Lima, Peru. Nine people 
were killed in the ensuing panic. Fiona Foster has the latest. More 
than 200 people were packed in the Suarez discotheque for a Christmas 
eve party when the revelry turned to panic. A canister filled with 
tear gas was thrown into the disco from the street, sending the partygoers 
for the doors. We were sitting at the back when they threw something 
in. I was at the back, and then suddenly everyone was running up the 
stairs. All the people were crushed. There was a door. They couldn't 
open the door and they were shouting, "go back, go back!" a police 
spokesman said the club's only door on the building's main floor was 
locked by the owners. The victims -- aged 12 to 21 -- were all crushed 
to death or suffocated. They're dead, including my son. Who's responsible. 
Whoever is responsible must pay. That's all I ask. Police said another 
eight people were badly injured. Most of the victims lived near the 
disco in Santa Anita, a shanty town on the outskirts of Lima. It's 
not clear who threw the gas canister. But some witnesses blamed local 
gangs. Neighbors said the disco is a regular site of gang clashes. 
One suspected gang member was taken into police custody following 
a clash with police outside the disco. Peruvian president alberto 
Fujimori ordered an immediate investigation into the incident. He 
says he wants authorities to look into other discos which operate 
without a license and adequate safety conditions. Fiona Foster, CNN.
