On this day after Christmas, shoppers are suiting up to do battle 
again at the mall. Stores are depending on after-Christmas sales to 
boost a disappointing holiday season, and they're offering big bargains 
to try to lure customers. Some stores are offering discounts as high 
as 70%, and many have included extra discount coupons in their newspaper 
ads. Clothing and toys are getting the biggest markdowns. The president 
of bloomingdale's says people have become more savvy when it comes 
to buying, and have intentionally put off many purchases until after 
the holidays, in hopes they'll be cheaper.
