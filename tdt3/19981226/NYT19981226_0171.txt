As union executive Billy Hunter feels the pressure of the Jan. 7 drop-dead 
date to cancel the National Basketball Association season closing 
in, he said Saturday that he expects to reach out to Commissioner 
David Stern on Sunday and he wants to schedule a meeting with the 
principals involved for this week. When reached at his home in Oakland, 
Calif., Hunter said he was flying back to New York on Saturday and 
planned to call Stern. ``It's a watch and wait situation,'' Hunter 
said. ``I'm thinking that David and I are going to be talking before 
the weekend is out, but I just don't know when. Right now I'm not 
optimistic because nothing is happening. I don't want to go into specifics, 
but things continue to be the same.'' When Stern set Jan. 7 as the 
drop-dead date last week, it spurred some activity. But Hunter said 
that absolutely nothing came of the secret late-night meeting he had 
with Stern in Los Angeles on Wednesday. If a new meeting can be scheduled 
for this week, it is unlikely to be a full bargaining session. Only 
a few major principals, such as the union president Patrick Ewing, 
and the NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, will likely join Stern 
and Hunter. One member of the union's negotiating committee said the 
players were confident a deal could get done if a swap of key compromises 
unfolds. The union is prepared to accept the league's proposal for 
a maximum salary for players with more than six years experience if 
the owners will add a median salary exception of about $1.3 million 
and raise the minimum salary. ``I don't think Billy will give unless 
there's a trade, straight up,'' one union official said. ``I think 
if those things can be worked out, we're not that far apart.'' One 
major sticking point still exists, though. The union has been adamant 
about getting 57 percent of the basketball-related revenues, while 
the league has not offered anything more than 53.5. With less than 
two weeks to make a deal, the pressure is intense on both sides. Hunter 
has had to watch as Karl Malone called the league's proposal fair 
and Kevin Willis call for a vote on it. Stern has the task of delivering 
a deal to appease the owners that will prevent the NBA from becoming 
the first major professional sport to cancel a season.
