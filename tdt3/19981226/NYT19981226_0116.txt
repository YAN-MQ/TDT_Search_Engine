Dr. Odo Struger, who invented the programmable logic controller, which 
makes possible modern factory automation, amusement-park rides and 
lavish stage effects in Broadway productions, died on Dec. 8 in Cleveland. 
He was 67. He had thyroid cancer, family members said. The device 
Struger invented, essentially a rugged computer that controls machinery, 
was based on a concept developed in his doctoral dissertation at the 
Technical University of Austria. It is now used in factories throughout 
the world. Struger left the university in 1956 for a job at Asea Brown 
Boveri, a Swiss power company. While there, he completed his dissertation, 
``The Process for Quantitative Handling of Positioning Errors of Numerical 
Control Machines.'' His paper led to a job in 1958 as a research engineer 
at Allen-Bradley in Milwaukee, where he headed the team that developed 
the programmable logic controller, or PLC, creating a billion-dollar-a-year 
business. Murray Slovick, editor of Spectrum, the magazine of the 
Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, said: ``Simply 
put, programmable logic controllers are what industry uses to automate 
factories. They are used to control a wide range of equipment, everything 
from heating, ventilation, air conditioning, to plastic injection 
molding machines to commercial washing machines to conveyor lines.'' 
Struger's invention has branched out from its blue-collar beginnings. 
``PLCs are pervasive,'' said William Little, chief technical officer 
at Rockwell Automation, Allen-Bradley's parent division. ``They show 
up in the road production of `Phantom of the Opera' and in rides at 
Disney World.'' Little said the devices were designed to work in real 
time, taking in information, processing it and producing commands 
to control a mechanical process as it happens. Struger had a long 
list of awards and technical achievements; he received the Prometheus 
Medal for technical innovation in 1996, the same year it was awarded 
to Leonardo da Vinci. Struger was also a fellow of the Institute for 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He held 50 patents and published 
more than 40 professional papers; a laboratory at the Technical University 
of Austria was recently named after him. Struger was an avid outdoorsman, 
said Karen Costantino-Struger, a daughter-in-law. He skied throughout 
his youth, winning a spot on Austria's all-academic team and becoming 
an alternate for the Austrian Olympic ski team, she said. He became 
a professional ski instructor, taught his sons to ski, and in 1991, 
when he was 60, won a national skiing title for his age group. Struger 
was born in Austria in 1931 and lived in Cleveland, where he had been 
a vice president for Allen-Bradley until retiring last year. He is 
survived by his wife, Marlene; two sons, Andre, of Farmington Hills, 
Mich., and Gregory, of Newbury, Ohio; a sister, Franziska Panger of 
Austria, and three grandchildren.
