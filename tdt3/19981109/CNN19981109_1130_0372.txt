CNN has learned there may be a link between osama bin laden and the 
world trade center bombing. Bin laden is wanted for the bombing attacks 
on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August. Sources say 
two of sheik Omar abdel Rahman's sons are members of bin laden's organization. 
Followers of Rahman were convicted of detonating a truck bomb under 
the world trade center in New York City in 1993. Rahman is serving 
a life sentence in a U.S. prison for conspiring to overthrow the government. 
Sources say Rahman has written a will in which he asks his sons to 
take revenge for him against the United States.
