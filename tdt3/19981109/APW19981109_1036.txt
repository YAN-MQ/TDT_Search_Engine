A visiting U.S. war crimes envoy saw first-hand evidence Monday of 
the ongoing violence in Kosovo _ the bodies of two Serb policemen 
who were apparently executed. David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador 
on war crimes issues, viewed the corpses in the devastated central 
village of Malisevo as he toured Kosovo with the Kosovo Diplomatic 
Observer Mission (KDOM). ``This represents one of the problems that 
is being experienced here with the cease-fire, and that is that there 
are violations of the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said. Dozens 
of Serb police are believed to have been killed since the start of 
a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last February in Kosovo. 
Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the population in the 
province in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. Several hundred 
other people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed in the fighting, 
and as many as 300,000 driven from their homes. The policemen disappeared 
Friday, the same day that Serb police shot to death five ethnic Albanian 
guerrillas, including a commander of two divisions. Both of the slain 
policemen had gunshot wounds to the head, indicating they had been 
killed execution-style. U.S. observers found the bodies Monday, Serb 
media said. It was unclear if their deaths were intended as retribution 
for the killing of the five Kosovo Liberation Army members. The rebels 
say police ambushed the five as they drove in two vehicles from Opterusa 
village, while police claim the guerrillas fired first on a police 
patrol. The KLA and Serb police traded accusations Monday that the 
recent killing proved that the other side violated a cease-fire. Under 
a four-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were supposed 
to cease hostilities. The KLA was not a party to the Oct. 12 agreement, 
but has declared its own unilateral cease-fire except in the case 
of attacks by Serb and Yugoslav forces. Violence by both sides has 
increased in the past week, including at least three incidents in 
which police reported killing KLA fighters who shot at them first. 
No police were killed or injured in any of those incidents. Qamil 
Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said Monday that 
his son's body was riddled with bullets. ``From what I saw, they were 
certainly ambushed,'' he said after waiting about four hours to collect 
the body from a hospital morgue in the southern city of Prizren. ``He 
was destroyed by many, many bullets.''
