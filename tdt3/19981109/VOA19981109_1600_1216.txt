The defending Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos could be without 
star quarterback John Elway next week. Elway was forced to leave the 
Bronco's win over San Diego on Sunday after just three plays with 
a strained rib cage muscle suffered during pre-game warm-ups. Denver 
head coach, Mike Shanahan, says those rib injuries are tough. This 
is a freak situation with the ribs. It has nothing to do with age 
in my opinion. This could happen your first year, your second year, 
your eighth year, your 16th year. Once you have those ribs injured 
and the way he had them injured, which is really kind of hard to come 
back from it. Denver will start back up Bobby Brister. The 38-year-old 
Elway can't play next Monday night against the Kansas City Chiefs.
