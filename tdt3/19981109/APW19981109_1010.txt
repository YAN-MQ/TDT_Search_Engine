A Club Mediterrannee where strikers held 373 tourists hostage over 
the weekend will remain closed until managers reach a deal with trade 
unions, the Paris-based resort chain said Monday. Police in riot gear 
raided the resort on the Caribbean island of Martinique on Sunday 
night to free the guests. Unions claimed four employees were injured 
during the raid, and some were treated for inhalation of tear gas 
used by the police. None of guests _ most of them French, German and 
Italian _ were hurt. About 200 employees at the Club Med in south 
coast Ste-Anne struck Wednesday to demand 8 percent raises. When negotiations 
with managers collapsed Saturday, the workers blocked the hotel's 
entrances and refused to let guests leave. Tourists said they were 
not mistreated by the hostage-takers. The resorts pools and other 
facilities remained open, and managers took over cooking for the guests. 
After the raid, police buses took guests to other hotels. The resort 
will remain closed until there is a labor agreement, said Club Med 
spokesman Christian Mure.
