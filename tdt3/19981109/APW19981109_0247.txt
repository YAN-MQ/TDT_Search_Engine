Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special presidential envoy for 
Africa, touched down in Nigeria on Monday morning pledging to help 
the West African nation move toward democracy. ``The day is breaking 
on Nigeria and we are moving toward morning,'' said Jackson, ``by 
February it will be the noon of democracy.'' Nigeria, which has been 
ruled by a string of military rulers for all but 10 years of it's 
38 years of independence, has been moving steadily toward democracy 
since the sudden June death of former dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. Gen. 
Abdulsalami Abubakar has freed political prisoners, met with foreign 
envoys and scheduled elections. He has repeatedly vowed to hand power 
to civilian authorities following presidential elections in February. 
Jackson said he was moved at having flown to Nigeria on a plane that 
also included some returning exiles. ``The government has put in place 
a credible apparatus for restoring democracy,'' he said. ``People 
are able to come back home and are organizing themselves. Detained 
persons, including journalists, have been freed and there is a revival 
of hope.'' Jackson, a Baptist minister and civil rights leader, will 
meet with a broad spectrum of Nigeria during his two-day visit, from 
religious leaders to human rights activists to politicians. He is 
expected to meet Abubakar in Abuja, the capital, on Tuesday. Jackson, 
who leaves Nigeria on Wednesday, is to return to the United States 
on Nov. 14 after visits to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Ghana.
