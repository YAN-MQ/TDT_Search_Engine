People are eating out less in New York City this year, but spending 
more when they do. That's one of the findings in the freshly released 
zagat survey for 1999. It gives restaurant-goers a chance to rate 
their favorite eateries. And this year, 18,000 responded. The survey 
finds New York the most expensive U.S. city for dining, with the average 
cost of a meal rising to $31.68, including tip.
