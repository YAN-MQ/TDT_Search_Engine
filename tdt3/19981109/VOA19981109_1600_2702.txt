The two Cosmonauts aboard the Russian Space Station Mir are preparing 
for a space walk today to install the device that captures very small 
meteorites. The instrument will be used to collect data when Mir flies 
through a meteorite shower in mid-November. The Cosmonauts are expected 
to leave Mir unmanned for six hours to attach the device and other 
scientific hardware.
