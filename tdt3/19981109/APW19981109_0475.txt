TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson arrived 
Monday for trade talks in a rare visit to Taiwan by an American Cabinet 
official that has already raised protests from China. ``I'm looking 
forward to opportunities to reaffirm and strengthen the longstanding 
friendship between Americans and the people of Taiwan,'' Richardson 
said in an arrival statement. His visit is considered an attempt by 
Washington to ease Taiwanese feelings of insecurity following statements 
by President Bill Clinton in China this summer that badly rattled 
Taiwan. Richardson was to meet Taiwanese officials before addressing 
an annual joint U.S.-Taiwan business conference Tuesday. He is also 
expected to meet with Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui before leaving 
Wednesday. Richardson said his presence at the business conference 
``reflects the strength of economic and commercial relations between 
the U.S. and Taiwan.'' Participants will hold workshop discussions 
on exchanges in fields including telecommunications, infrastructure, 
venture capital and biotechnology. Clinton's strong reiteration that 
Washington would not back Taiwan's attempts to assert itself internationally 
was seen here as a concession to China that would encourage Beijing 
to isolate the island it considers a renegade province. Taiwanese 
officials have called for reassurances that Washington's support remains. 
Media here said Richardson's background as a former U.S. ambassador 
to the United Nations and a close White House confidant make his presence 
particularly significant. China has protested the visit, labeling 
it an official contact that violates agreements between China and 
the United States. China's Foreign Ministry warned last week of possible 
damage to the ``hard-won development in China-U.S. ties.'' A similar 
visit by then-U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena in 1994 
prompted China to cancel Pena's planned visit to Beijing. Visits by 
U.S. Cabinet officials to Taiwan have been few and far between since 
the Carter administration severed diplomatic ties in 1979 to allow 
it to establish relations with China. Richardson's is the first such 
visit since Philip Lader, then head of the Small Business Administration, 
came in 1996. The United States revised its policy in 1994 to allow 
regular visits to Taiwan by officials in technical and economic fields, 
but concern over harming Chinese sensitivities has kept such trips 
to a minimum. U.S. businesses here had argued they were losing contracts 
to European competitors whose governments were more willing to send 
officials to lobby for deals. The United States, Taiwan's largest 
trading partner, receives 23 percent of the island's exports and accounts 
for 20 percent of its imports. Two-way trade topped U.S. dlrs 52 billion 
in 1997.
