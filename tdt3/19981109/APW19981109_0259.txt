Averting a coalition split, parliament rejected an income tax bill 
Monday that included deductions for families and trade unions which 
the finance minister had said Poland could not afford. Deputies from 
Solidarity, the main party in the governing coalition, on Friday had 
unexpectedly amended the bill to grant deductions for families with 
children and making union benefits income tax-free. Party leaders 
argued the deductions were in line with the union-rooted bloc's electoral 
program. But Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, leader of the market-oriented 
Freedom Union, the junior coalition partner, said the deductions would 
cut revenues by 150 million zlotys (dlrs 44 million), which Poland 
could not afford. As part of a compromise worked out over the weekend, 
coalition deputies agreed to vote against the amended tax bill as 
a way of eliminating the controversial deductions. The deputies also 
lowered the 1999 corporate income tax to 34 percent from 36 percent. 
The reduction was planned already in 1996. The current three income-based 
tax brackets _ 19 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent _ remain in force 
with deductions for housing, private education and health care. Balcerowicz 
had called for a 22 percent flat tax and elimination of various deductions 
to simplify the tax system. Over the weekend, the coalition agreed 
to present proposals of tax changes by the end of January and to vote 
on a new simplified tax system in June.
