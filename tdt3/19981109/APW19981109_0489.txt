A visiting Irish politician said Monday he believes Iraq is willing 
to compromise to head off threatened military action over suspended 
U.N. weapons inspections, but Britain's defense secretary says time 
was running out. Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting cooperation 
with international inspectors until the Security Council begins moving 
to lift the sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait. The devastating sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and 
other financial dealings, can only be lifted once inspectors certify 
that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction. Former Irish 
Prime Minister Albert Reynolds appealed to the United States and Britain 
to abandon threats of a military strike and to negotiate a settlement. 
``We believe that with good will on both sides, that a compromise 
could be worked out,'' he said. Reynolds, a member of the Irish Parliament, 
was credited with encouraging the Irish Republic Army's 1994 cease-fire. 
He planned to leave Iraq later Monday and said he would travel to 
the United States on Thursday to confer with American politicians. 
But Britain's Defense Secretary George Robertson on a visit to Kuwait 
said the world's patience with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is ``draining 
away.'' A diplomatic solution to resolve the crisis is ``still possible'' 
but the ``option of force is there, is real,'' Robertson told reporters 
in Kuwait where Britain has stationed 12 Tornado bombers. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton met Sunday with top security advisers, but put off a 
decision on whether to use force against Iraq to reopen military sites 
to U.N. inspectors. Reynolds said he met with Iraq's deputy prime 
minister, Tariq Aziz, for more than two hours on Sunday. He described 
Aziz as ``open'' and ``very flexible.'' Reynolds said: ``Today I would 
like to send a very clear message and a clear call to the United Nations, 
to President Clinton and to (British) Prime Minister Tony Blair that 
whatever (their feelings) about the conflict, that everybody gets 
around the table to dialogue and debate and talk to remove the sanctions.'' 
He suggested that the United Nations lift sanctions on medicine to 
let supplies into Iraq. ``I think there would be a corresponding response 
from Tariq Aziz and the Iraqi government'' to such a goodwill gesture, 
he said. ``Nobody wants to see a resumption of a conflict that has 
such horrendous repercussions on the people of Iraq and on the children 
that are suffering most of all,'' Reynolds said. Iraqi Trade Minister 
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Sunday that Iraq did not fear a military 
strike. ``They will not kill in a military strike more than they are 
killing with sanctions every day,'' he said. Also Monday, five more 
inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission _ which is responsible 
for elimination of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well 
as long-range missiles _ left the country. Caroline Cross, UNSCOM 
spokeswoman in Baghdad, said 10 more inspectors are to depart Wednesday, 
which will raise the total to 30 since UNSCOM began the partial pull 
out Saturday. She noted that more than 100 U.N. weapons staffers remain 
in the country and could resume inspections immediately if Iraq changes 
it positions. Although Iraq halted UNSCOM's work, it exempted monitors 
from the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency. 
Two IAEA teams went into the field on Monday, as they have on most 
days this month. They were accompanied by UNSCOM technicians who were 
collecting samples from air sensors, Ms. Cross said.
