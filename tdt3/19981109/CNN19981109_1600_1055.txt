Auto companies are trying to make cars and light trucks lighter. One 
key ingredient of that recipe is aluminum, and now General Motors 
is entering into a long-term multi-billion dollar deal to buy aluminum

aluminum at steady prices. GM says it plans to increase aluminum in 
its cars by 7% a year.
