NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Israel assured Cyprus of its continuing friendship 
Monday after two Israelis were arrested on suspicion of spying for 
the Greek Cypriot government's archenemy, Turkey. Israeli President 
Ezer Weizman sent his Cypriot counterpart, Glafcos Clerides, ``a message 
of friendship, of continuation of what we achieved during Weizman's 
visit, upgrading the relations,'' Israeli Ambassador Shemi Tzur told 
reporters. Saturday's arrest of the two Israelis came three days after 
Weizman visited Nicosia and assured Clerides that Israel's military 
accord with Turkey was not aimed at Cyprus. The arrest caused a strain 
in relations _ newly repaired by the first visit of an Israeli president 
to Cyprus _ but both countries acted quickly to head off permanent 
damage. ``We do hope that this cloud which appeared this last weekend 
will leave us and we will continue our good relations,'' Tzur said 
as he left Clerides' office with Ariel Shumer, the director-general 
of Weizman's office who delivered the message. On Cyprus' part, a 
statement by the Justice Ministry on Sunday evening said that nothing 
had transpired yet to link the two arrested men to Israel's government. 
But other officials pointed out that the two men _ identified as Udi 
Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47 _ would not be freed until after a 
thorough investigation. Israel has not denied the men worked for its 
Mossad intelligence agency. Asked Sunday if they were Israeli agents, 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ``every Israeli citizen is 
important to us. We'll clarify this, and of course we'll bring them 
home.'' The two Israelis were seized in an apartment in the fishing 
village of Ziyi, halfway between the coastal cities of Larnaca and 
Limassol. They appeared in court and were ordered held for eight days 
for a police investigation. A police statement said that the two were 
suspected of spying on the Cypriot National Guard and that cameras, 
recording of police radio messages, radio scanners and maps were found 
in the apartment. Police officials said privately that the Israelis 
probably were gathering information for Turkey, which maintains 35,000 
troops in the Turkish-occupied northern third of the island. On Monday, 
Cypriot dailies and radio stations criticized the Justice Ministry 
statement saying no connection had yet been found to Israel's government. 
This prompted a series of clarifying remarks by various Cypriot officials. 
Justice Minister Nicos Koshis said ``the two will not be released 
or deported before a thorough investigation,'' and government spokesman 
Christos Stylianides noted the ministry's statement referred to the 
investigation ``until that moment, and does not rule out anything.'' 
Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou said ``Cyprus is concerned by the 
military alliance between Israel and Turkey which includes the exchange 
of information. If the two arrested Israelis are Mossad agents, this 
will create a grave political issue and have serious repercussions.''
