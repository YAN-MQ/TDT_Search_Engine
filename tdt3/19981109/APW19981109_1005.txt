An Israeli military general said army choirs have no business singing 
peace songs because they promise a situation the army cannot deliver, 
Israel TV reported Monday. Gen. Yaakov Amidror, commander of the army's 
National Security College, told a recent convention of senior army 
officers that two popular peace songs, ``The Last War,'' and ``The 
Children of the Winter of '73,'' should be banned from the army choir's 
repertoire. ``We didn't promise peace, we didn't promise a dove with 
an olive branch, and it's inappropriate for an army choir to sing 
it,'' Israel TV quoted Amidror as telling the convention. Left wing 
politicians decried Amidror's criticism and called for his resignation. 
Amidror apparently cited lyrics including, ``I promise you, my little 
girl, that this will be the last war,'' from the song written in the 
wake of the 1973 Mideast war, as objectionable. In a statement released 
to the press, Amidror neither confirmed nor denied he made the remarks. 
He said only that his comments were made in a private forum and that 
it was inappropriate to discuss them with the media. The Israeli army 
said only that Amidror was expressing his personal opinion.
