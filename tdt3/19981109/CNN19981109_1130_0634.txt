But first -- here's this edition of "your health." During cold and 
flu season, many people will reach for ear thermometers what they 
have a fever. A physician from the University of Alabama warns they 
are often inaccurate. He tested two different brands and found some 
patients with high fevers showed normal temperatures. The manufacturers 
admit ear thermometers can produce erroneous readings. They require 
proper training and proper positioning to ensure accurate results. 
This instrument is so sensitive, if you hold it in the ear this way, 
you may get one temperature. If you move it less than half inch, you 
get a different temperature. Dr. model says they should be used with 
caution. Even though the probe has a disposeable tip cover, bacteria 
was found on the devices and half the samples had bacteria resist 
tent to antibiotics. The convenience of ear thermometers make them 
essential in some situations. For more news log on to CNN.com CNN.com/health.
