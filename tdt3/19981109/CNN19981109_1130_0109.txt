The winds of change are blowing through the republican party. Today, 
representative Chris Cox from California withdrew his name as candidate 
for speaker of the house. He's the third potential replacement for 
the position to withdraw his name. Cox threw his support behind Louisiana 
representative Bob Livingston. He says the decision was an effort 
to help unify republicans. I don't know that pushing our leadership 
election for the top job in the House of Representatives into next 
week, causing people to change their personal promises to me and to 
Bob Livingston when we got it to 90 for me and 110 for him at this 
point, is a good idea given that we start with voter majority. And 
what we really need to do is be unified as we tackle the policy challenges 
in education and social security, in national security and tax reform 
that lie ahead of us. Republicans will decide Newt Gingrich's replacement 
in nine days. The house speaker announced last week he would not seek 
re-election to the post. And over the weekend, Gingrich said he would 
also give up his congressional seat. The Georgia republican drew a 
lot of criticism from within his own party after last week's midterm 
elections. The GOP lost five house seats to the democrats. Gingrich 
plans to talk about his decision to quit and his future during tonight's 
meeting of gopac, the republican fundraising group he once lead.
