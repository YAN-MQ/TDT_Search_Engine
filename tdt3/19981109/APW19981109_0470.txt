A senior Turkish government official called Monday for closer military 
cooperation with neighboring Bulgaria. After talks with President 
Petar Stoyanov at the end of his four-day visit, Turkish Deputy Premier 
and National Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin expressed satisfaction 
with the progress of bilateral relations and the hope that Bulgarian-Turkish 
military cooperation will be promoted. Relations between the two Balkan 
countries suffered badly after the communist regime in Bulgaria forced 
the one million members of the ethnic Turkish minority to change their 
names and deprived them of the rights to use their language, religion 
and customs. After visiting several military plants, Sezgin noted 
that great efforts are being made by Bulgaria to bring their output 
into conformity with NATO standards. ``Representatives of the Turkish 
military-industrial complex are expected in Bulgaria within ten days. 
They will get familiar on the spot with the capabilities of the Bulgarian 
defense industry with a view to continued bilateral cooperation in 
military technology,'' Sezgin was quoted by the state news agency 
BTA as saying. While part of the former Soviet bloc, Bulgaria developed 
a respected arms industry, known for its quality small arms, anti-tank 
and anti-aircraft rockets, artillery systems, armored vehicles and 
electronics. Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, the defense industry 
has been largely idled, piling up debts as it lost its traditional 
markets in the former Soviet bloc and the Middle East. Turkey, a NATO 
member country, is viewed by neighboring Bulgaria as a partner that 
could back its aspirations to join the pact.
