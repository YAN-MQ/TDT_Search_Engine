The European Union plans to give Russia another shot in the arm to 
offsets its economic crisis. European countries are discussing food 
aide for $450 million to help the cash-strapped country. That's on 
top of the 600 million approved by Washington last week. With more 
here's David Leeks. Worth around $450 million it consists of a millions 
tons of wheat, half a million tons of rye, along with substantial 
amounts of pig meat, beef, rice, and milk powder. It will be given 
to Russia to be sold at local market prices. But, the revenues will 
then be put into a special social funds to help the most needy. But, 
this deal is far from complete. The EU first wants a formal request 
from Russia for the food, plus guarantees it will be given to the 
right people. One EU official said that it was far from certain that 
the food could be sent before the end of the year. David Leeks reporting.
