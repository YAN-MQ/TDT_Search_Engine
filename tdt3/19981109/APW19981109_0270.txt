European Union competition regulators gave the all-clear Monday to 
the purchase by Toyota Motor Corp. of a majority stake in its affiliate, 
Daihatsu Motor Corp. ``The overlap between the product ranges of Toyota 
and Daihatsu is limited both at overall EU level and in each individual 
(EU) member state,'' the European Commission said in a statement. 
The Commission has powers to examine major mergers or alliances between 
companies doing business in the 15 EU nations, even if they involve 
only non-European firms. In August, Toyota said it will pay about 
37 billion yen (dlrs 313 million) to increase its share in Daihatsu 
from its existing 34.5 percent to 51.2 percent. Toyota, Japan's largest 
automaker, said closer ties with Daihatsu will help the companies 
confront intensifying global competition and share technology in developing 
environment-friendly vehicles.
