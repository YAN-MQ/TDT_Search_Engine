Chances are your personal computer runs on a Microsoft operating system, 
such as Windows 95 or Windows 98. Now, an alternative is gaining popularity. 
And it's free. Ann Kellan has details in this edition of "tech trends." 
People know this logo. What about this one? The Penguin stands for 
linux, an operating system that's competing with windows to run your 
computer. Linux is free, it rarely crashes and it's not owned by anyone. 
It's very stable. It's very robust and reliable, so it has a lot going 
for it in those regards. I let my computer run for 2 1/2 months without 
having to reboot. Jim Allen loaded it on his computer because the 
price is right. Everything on this compute ser free. I paid for nothing. 
It is community property. So far 7 million have tried it. Many have 
added to it and improved it. Unlike Microsoft that closes the blinds 
to anyone wanting to know the nuts and bolts of how it works, linux 
is open and shares its source code with everyone. That open source 
code is why linux is worrying some at Microsoft. They wrote -- but 
Microsoft maintains it's number one and will fight hard to stay that 
way. It's up to us to once again put an offering out there in the 
marketplace that makes them hesitate and say, I really should consider 
windows. Jim Allen, who enjoys tinkering with computer software admits 
those who don't, might not like linux. That could be changing. The 
backing for linux by big companies, software suches a spread sheets, 
word processors and graphics editors are becoming available, making 
linux more appealing. But whether this community of Penguins can fly 
in the face of Microsoft, remains to be seen. Ann Kellan, CNN, Atlanta.
