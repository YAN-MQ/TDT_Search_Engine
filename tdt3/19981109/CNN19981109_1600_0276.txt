From now on, whenever a president gets advice from an attorney on 
his staff, details of their conversations may not necessarily remain 
confidential. The Supreme Court today let stand a lower court's decision 
that discussions between a president and government lawyers aren't 
protected by attorney/client privilege. That means presidential adviser 
Bruce Lindsay can't refuse to answer a Grand jury's questions about 
Mr. Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky case. The White House 
says it's disappointed with the high court's action.
