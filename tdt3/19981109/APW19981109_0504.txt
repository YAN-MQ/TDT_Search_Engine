Government troops chased the last large group of rebel fighters into 
the mountains on Monday after five days of fighting in the Central 
Asian nation. The 200 rebels concentrated around the town of Aini, 
about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital Dushanbe, tried 
to flee in small groups toward the border of Uzbekistan after suffering 
heavy losses in weekend firefights with government soldiers. ``Practically 
all the Aini district is now under control of government troops,'' 
said Tajikistan Security Minister Saidamir Zakhurov. Government officials 
say the rebels would not escape because the area is surrounded, the 
border with Uzbekistan has been closed, and all roads have been cut 
off. As fighting in Aini subsided, the International Red Cross in 
Tajikistan sent a delegation to northern Tajikistan to survey the 
damage and distribute medical supplies. Red Cross officials said 40 
homes had been completely destroyed in fighting over the weekend in 
the city of Khudzhand, and more than 2,000 homes needed repairs. They 
also said over 500 people had been wounded in Khudzhand. The government 
has said that more than 200 people have been killed since the fighting 
broke out last Wednesday. Meanwhile, the whereabouts of rebel leader, 
former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, were unknown, said presidential 
spokesman Zafar Saidov. There were unconfirmed reports suggesting 
that Khudoberdyev and former Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov 
had already escaped into Uzbekistan, Saidov said. The Tajikistan government 
appealed to Uzbekistan, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet 
Union for assistance in detaining organizers of the revolt. Khudoberdyev 
launched the uprising with demands that President Emomali Rakhmonov 
free all political prisoners and bring his supporters into the government. 
The president refused to negotiate with the rebels. The fighting follows 
a peace treaty last year that ended five years of civil war between 
the Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's hardline government. Main opposition 
groups are now participating in the government and the armed forces. 
Still, there are many rebel leaders and warlords who ignore the accords 
and wage small-scale attacks across the poor, mountainous former Soviet 
republic. Rakhmonov released a statement denouncing the rebels, and 
saying their uprising had not derailed Tajikistan's attempts to adhere 
to the peace treaty, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Monday. ``The 
peace process in the republic is continuing and there are no forces 
able to stop it,'' he said.
