Two prison inmates in the US State of West Virginia have found that 
there's something worse than being in prison and that's being without 
beer. Last month, Frank Bertrain and Timothy Nottingham escaped from 
the medium security lockout at Puttytown, West Virginia Correctional 
Center. Mr. Bertrain had been serving time for burglary; Nottingham 
was jailed on grand larceny charges. Well, to celebrate their escape 
from prison, they walked into a nearby convenience store to buy a 
six-pack of beer. As the spokesman at the jail described it, the clerk 
asked the two for identification, proof that they were old enough 
to buy alcohol. Bertrain is 21 and Nottingham was 23. They were old 
enough, but they couldn't prove it, because when they escaped from 
jail they had no identification card with them. They couldn't get 
any beer. So, they walked on back to jail and turn themselves in. 
Said freedom just isn't worth it.
