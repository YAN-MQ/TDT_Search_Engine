Formal impeachment hearings on President Clinton are set to begin 
next week in the house Judiciary committee. As a prelude to that, 
a subcommittee on the constitution opened a hearing today on what 
constitutes an impeachable offense. 19 scholars shared their opinions 
about whether President Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky matter 
can be construed as high crimes and misdemeanors. Judiciary committee 
members also are reflecting on whether the republican leadership struggle 
in the house will have an impact on the impeachment inquiry. I would 
not expect whoever be elected speaker to come in and try to change 
the course of the hearings and what we are doing. I wouldn't expect 
any impact on them, but again, I can be surprised.
