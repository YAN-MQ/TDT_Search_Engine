UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan is urging Iraq to resume cooperation 
with UN weapons inspections. Mr. Annan spoke in Laratenia during a 
stop over on a 10-day Africa tour. John Pitman has more from our West 
Africa bureau. UN Secretary-General is in West Africa to promote a 
peaceful resolution to the decades long conflict in the western Sahara. 
However, during a stop over in the Lockjac, the capital of Moratania, 
Mr. Annan told reporters that Iraq's decision to stop cooperating 
with UN weapons inspectors is in his words "a flagrant violation of 
UN Security Counsel resolution". Mr. Annan said the Iraqi government 
should reconsider its decision and resume cooperation immediately. 
There was no immediate reaction from Baghdad. Iraq abruptly cut ties 
with the UN late last month. Bahgdad says it will not allow UN weapons 
inspectors to continue their work until the Security Counsel sets 
a timetable for lifting the economic sanctions which it imposed on 
Bahgdad after the Iraqi army invaded Kuwait in 1990. The Security 
Counsel has renewed those sanctions repeatedly arguing that Iraq has 
not yet complied with resolutions designed to curtail its ability 
to produce weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Annan traveled to Bahgdad 
earlier this year to help resolve a similar impasse over weapons inspections. 
However, in Moratania on Sunday, Mr. Annan says he has no plans to 
visit Iraq again. He says the matter is now in the hands of the Security 
Counsel, several of who's members are mobilizing for possible military 
action against Iraq. On Sunday, Britain and the United States continued 
to draw up plans for a possible strike against Iraq. US President 
Bill Clinton met with his senior security advisors on Sunday and asked 
them to prepare a list of diplomatic and military options. John Pitman,
