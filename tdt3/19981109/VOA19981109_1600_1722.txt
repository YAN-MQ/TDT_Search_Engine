We're in Monterey Bay off the coast of Southern California searching 
for gray whales on their annual migration to Baja, Mexico where they'll 
spend winter. I'm Jim Nesmith and this is "The Pulse of the Planet" 
presented by the American Museum of Natural History. This is where 
the game really starts. We've seen the blow and now we're going to 
certainly start watching for more, see how long the whale will be 
up, and try to time the dive and surface sequences so that we can 
match its pace. Here we go. with the Parade Whale Research Project 
run by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in Monterey, California. He 
and his partner, Tim Morrison, have been following the whale's migratory 
movements from aboard their kayak trying to learn more about the animal's 
open sea behavior. Tim sets the scene for us as we paddle closer to 
a group of whales. When we first spotted them, there were there whales. 
Now there's six or seven whales. Maybe they're milling. They're picking 
up their numbers to cross the bay. Safety in numbers. Instead of a 
lone whale, you've got ten or 12 whales. It's the largest crossing 
on their migratory pattern and this is where they'd be more susceptible 
to orcas or sharks. Listen carefully and you'll hear the whale blow 
as it surfaces in the tail. about a mile off there. Got a lot of whales 
here. While in some places, the gray whales follow the shore line, 
in others, this part of California, for example, they stay further 
out into the open sea. Eventually, Steth and Tim will be able to tag 
the whales giving scientists new insights into animals' migratory 
behavior.
