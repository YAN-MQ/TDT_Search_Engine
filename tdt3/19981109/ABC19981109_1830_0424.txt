Saddam Hussein with U.N. inspection rules by using force on him again 
if they could force him, the Iraqis appear to be digging in keeping 
U.N. inspectors from inspecting much of anything. In Baghdad tonight, 
ABC's Sheila MacVicar. Unable to do their work, five more U.N. weapons 
inspectors packed up and left Baghdad today. 20 have now departed. 
And ten more have scheduled to leave later this week. That will leave 
a hundred or so behind, enough inspectors, they say, to do their work, 
if they are allowed. The people who are remaining behind do have the 
skills and the experience to resume our work. If Iraq would only let 
them do that. But for 96 days, they have been prevented by Iraq from 
doing more than monitor the site they already know about. Sites where 
they have installed cameras, or sensors designed to detect chemicals. 
Two teams were allowed to go out today, but only to ensure their monitoring 
equipment was in working order. The technical side of it, on its own, 
is very, very low degree of confidence. It's a very poor degree of 
monitoring. And the U.N. says that is clearly not good enough to ensure 
that iraqis leaders are not engaged in the production of prohibited 
weapons. In the past, when military strikes have seemed imminent, 
the U.N. has always withdrawn most of its personnel here, they have 
not done that yet. Sheila MacVicar, ABC News, Baghdad.
