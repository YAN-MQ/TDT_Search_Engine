As the first deadline in the Mideast peace accord came and went Monday, 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ignored U.S. pressure to stick to 
the timetable and said he would not go forward until the Palestinians 
combat militants. Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said 
Israel will also likely miss the land-for-security agreement's Nov. 
16 withdrawal date, when Israeli troops are to begin a phased pullout 
from 13 percent of the West Bank. ``There will be a few days' delay, 
I presume,'' Bar-Illan said. Already, the accord has fallen one week 
behind schedule. The start of the deal, which is to be implemented 
over 12 weeks, has been held up for one week by Israel over requests 
for clarifications on Palestinian obligations under the deal. After 
a Friday suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market, Israel's Cabinet suspended 
indefinitely debate over the agreement until the Palestinians do more 
to fight Islamic militant groups. ``We would like to proceed with 
the agreement as soon as we have assurances that the spate of terrorist 
bombings have been taken care of by systematic comprehensive action 
by the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said. But the Palestinians said they 
are carrying out their commitments and said Israel is using the security 
issue as a stall tactic. Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said 
the agreement is ``as good as dead'' if Israel refuses to carry out 
the withdrawals on time. ``He (Netanyahu) cannot expect to have implementation 
of one part of the agreement, our commitments, and postpone the other 
part,'' he said. Meanwhile, Israel and the United States appeared 
to be at odds over three key issues is the accord _ the timetable, 
continued Jewish settlement expansion and the procedure for revoking 
provisions in the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. 
U.S. embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said that in a phone call last 
week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Netanyahu that 
she expected Israel to implement the agreement on time. ``Our understanding 
is that the Wye timetable will not slip,'' Schwartz told The Associated 
Press. ``The timetable is meant to continue as it was signed.''
