You're tuned to News Now. I'm Charlene Porter along with Kurt Hanshen. 
That's business for this hour. And on to music news this week. The 
White House pays tribute to some great American singers, folk, rock, 
and opera. Country Start Garth Brooks has big, big, plans for his 
new recording and the multi-talented Whitney Houston has a brand new 
album coming out with absolutely no previews. VOA's Catharine Cole 
has details on these and other stories.
