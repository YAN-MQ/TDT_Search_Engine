Major League Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Catfish Hunter has 
been diagnosed with a fatal illness known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
Doctors in Baltimore, Maryland confirmed the condition last Friday 
after Hunter experienced difficulty in movement. Lou Gehrig's disease 
is named after the famous New York Yankees Hall of Famer who died 
in 1941 of the ailment at the age of 37. There is no cure for the 
progressive neurological condition and ultimately ends in death. The 
52-year-old Hunter won 224 games during a 15-year career with the 
New York Yankees and the Oakland Athletics.
