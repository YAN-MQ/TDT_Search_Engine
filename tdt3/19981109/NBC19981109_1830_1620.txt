Although his downfall came unexpectedly and swiftly, Newt Gingrich 
did leave his Mark on Washington. He forced everyone to think of nagging 
problems in new ways. He did design the strategy that got the republicans 
into power on the hill, but in the end, he was a victim of an old 
Washington affliction that infects both parties. Just one week ago, 
Newt Gingrich was a powerful presence in these corridors. He did much 
more than set political Tone and the agenda for Congress. He decided 
who got the office space and who got the purks of office. As one of 
the most powerful figures in American politics, he traveled in style, 
preaching the gospel conservative certainty. He loved the spotlight 
and the microphone, never passing an opportunity to share his passions. 
I believe public judgment is consistently wiser and much more conservative 
than public opinion. He also could never resist a fight. And in an 
era of image politics, the kinder, gentler Gingrich seemed more forced 
than real. When the Gingrich revolution collapsed a week ago tomorrow, 
he blamed a Familiar target. It's a little disingenuous to spend all 
the news media time on a topic, then turn and say, "why are these 
other folks so obsessed with it?" The fact is, we were concerned with 
saving social security, cutting taxes, strengthening defense. When 
Gingrich first took over the speaker's gavel four years ago, there 
was talk his movement would last well into the 21st century. That 
was Washington talk, insiders listening mostly to each other. Gingrich, 
who began as an outsider, became an insider. In the end, he was still 
talking when he might have been better off listening.
