Indonesian military chief Gen. Wiranto said Monday that the armed 
forces was willing to discuss demands to limit its prominent role 
in politics, the official Antara news agency reported. He said any 
decisions should be left to the 1,000-member People's Consultative 
Assembly, which includes a sizable military faction. The Southeast 
Asian nation's highest legislative body meets Tuesday to debate how 
to reform the tightly controlled political system that kept Suharto 
in office for so long. The Asian financial crisis led to riots that 
toppled Suharto five months ago. ``The problem is not in agreeing 
or disagreeing, but we cannot preempt the final result of the session,'' 
Antara quoted Wiranto as saying. One proposal to be considered by 
the assembly would reduce the number of seats allotted to the military 
in the 500-seat Parliament from 75 to 55. The military began scaling 
back its role in politics in the final years of the authoritarian 
rule of Suharto, a former army general. Student protesters, however, 
say all members of Parliament should be elected and appointed seats 
should be abolished. In line with reforms, Wiranto said the military 
planned to reduce the number of active military officers holding civilian 
positions in the government. He also announced that the name of a 
top military post, the chief of staff for socio-political affairs, 
would be changed to chief of staff for territorial affairs. It was 
not immediately clear if the duties of the officer holding the post 
would change.
