Despite new U.S. demands that Israel stick to the time table of the 
Wye peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday 
he will not move forward until the Palestinians do more to combat 
Islamic militants. Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said 
Israel will probably not begin its phased troop withdrawal from 13 
percent of the West Bank on Nov. 16, as stipulated by the land-for-security 
accord with the Palestinians. ``There will be a few days' delay, I 
presume,`` Bar-Illan said. Israel appears to be at odds with the United 
States on three key issues of the peace accord _ the time table, continued 
Jewish settlement expansion and and the procedure for revoking provisions 
of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's construction. In 
a phone call last week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
told Netanyahu that she expected Israel to implement the agreement 
on time, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz. ``Our understanding 
is that the Wye timetable will not slip,'' Schwartz told The Associated 
Press. ``The timetable is meant to continue as it was signed.'' Palestinian 
negotiator Hassan Asfour said the agreement is ``as good as dead'' 
if Israel refuses to carry out the withdrawals on time. ``He cannot 
expect to have implementation of one part of the agreement, our commitments, 
and postpone the other part,'' he said. Concerning the PLO charter, 
Albright sided with the Palestinians who say the clauses need to be 
changed by acclamation, but not by a vote, the Maariv daily said. 
Netanyahu said Monday he insisted on a vote. ``I think the most important 
thing is that both sides fulfill their obligations stipulated in the 
agreement,'' Netanyahu said. ``We are prepared to fulfill our side 
when the Palestinians combat terrorism and when they bring the charter 
for a vote.'' Albright also took Netanyahu to task for continued settlement 
expansion, Maariv said. ``We cannot make progress this way,'' the 
newspaper quoted Albright as telling Netanyahu. ``It is impossible 
to view them as anything but a provocation.'' Since the Oct. 23 signing 
of the accord, settlers have set up mobile homes on five West Bank 
hills in what one hard-line politician described as a last-minute 
land grab. ``What won't be ours, will be theirs,'' Benny Elon, a member 
of the ultranationalist Moledet Party, told the Haaretz newspaper. 
``It's simple. We have to grab the land.'' Netanyahu aides have also 
said that construction in the Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa in traditionally 
Arab east Jerusalem would begin in the near future. Netanyahu has 
said the Israeli Cabinet has to ratify the agreement before Israel 
can begin fulfilling its commitments. In the past two weeks, Cabinet 
debate was postponed or broken off four times by Netanyahu who said 
he needed more clarifications from the Palestinians. Last Friday, 
ministers dispersed in response to a suicide bombing by the Islamic 
Jihad group in Jerusalem in which two assailants were killed and 21 
Israelis injured. Bar-Illan said he expected to Cabinet to reconvene 
later this week, though no date has been set. Israel's parliament 
was to debate the accord Tuesday and Wednesday, but is postponing 
the session until the Cabinet has voted on the agreement. An Israeli 
opposition legislator, Haim Ramon, said Netanyahu apparently was trying 
to hold off on a Cabinet vote until after a key coalition partner, 
the National Religious Party, decides in a convention early next week 
whether to stay in the government.
