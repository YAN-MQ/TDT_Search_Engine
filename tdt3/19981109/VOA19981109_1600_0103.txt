I'm Becky Bailey, VOA News. China is keeping up its criticism of Tibet's 
exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who's in Washington for talks 
with senior U.S. officials. An editorial in the "Official People's 
Daily" has accused the Dalai Lama of being insincere about wanting 
talks with Beijing. Well, the Dalai Lama is to meet with Vice President 
Al Gore at the White House later today. President Clinton is expected 
to drop by the meeting. VOA's Debra Tate reports. The Dalai Lama is 
expected to use his White House visit to discuss his intent to respond 
to what he believes is an openness on the part of Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin for dialogue. During a Beijing summit in June, Mr. Clinton 
appealed Mr. Jiang to open a dialogue with the Dalai Lama. The Chinese 
leader appeared receptive to the idea but only on condition the Dalai 
Lama declare his total allegiance to Beijing and not seek independence 
for his home land, even though some of the spiritual leader's followers 
demand nothing short of an independent Tibet. In an interview with 
the Voice of America Monday, the Dalai Lama said he believes prospects 
for dialogue appear brighter, but he says more needs to be done to 
make that reality. During his visit to Washington, he is also to meet 
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Debra Tate, VOA News at 
the White House.
