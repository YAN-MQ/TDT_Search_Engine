This is meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Quite a contrast in temperatures today over the U.S., where we'll 
find 20s through Montana and the 80s by the time you get into Texas. 
Big storm system responsible for that big change in temperature and 
this major winter storm will be spreading through the midwest over 
the next 24 hours, bringing with it heavy snows through the dakotas, 
back through northern Minnesota and blizzard-like conditions are forecast 
by late tomorrow. Along that cold front, that is moving into the southeast 
by tomorrow. Strong to severe thunderstorms are likely. In the pacific 
northwest, new storm system moving in that will spread some rain and 
mountain snows inland. A look now at the extended forecast -- rain 
will be likely in the northeast on Wednesday. We'll find thunderstorms 
for the mid-atlantic into the southeast and snow showers continue 
along with windy conditions through the upper midwest. On Thursday, 
a mix of rain and snow back through the Great Lakes. And rain likely 
in the pacific northwest as you move inland, some of that in the form 
of snow. And by Friday, another shot of colder air will be moving 
in through much of the upper midwest. For even more weather information,
