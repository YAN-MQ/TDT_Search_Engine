Georgian police on Monday arrested two men suspected of helping plot 
a one-day mutiny against President Eduard Shevardnadze, but the alleged 
leader of the uprising remains at large, a top official said. The 
men arrested were Dzhemal Zarkua, the leader of an opposition political 
movement, and Col. Genri Lolua, who had worked at Georgia's Joint 
Military Academy, Internal Affairs First Deputy Minister Teimuraz 
Murgulia said on state television. Officials say over 40 people have 
been arrested for alleged involvement in the revolt so far, including 
about 30 civilians, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Led by military 
commander Akaky Eliava, soldiers from a western Georgian garrison 
mutinied Oct. 19. The soldiers returned to their garrison but Eliava 
went into hiding and has not been located. Eliava supported Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia, the man who led Georgia when it gained independence 
in 1991 from the Soviet Union. Gamsakhurdia was ousted in early 1992 
and fought a short war in a bid to return to power. He died under 
mysterious circumstances in 1994. His followers remain bitterly opposed 
to Shevardnadze.
