Women who say their Dow corning silicone breast implants caused health 
problems may soon start receiving some money. A $3.2 billion settlement 
deal was filed in a federal bankruptcy court today. 140,000 women 
have filed suit against Dow corning. Under the proposal, each would 
receive from $200,000 to $300,000. A judge, the plaintiffs and a group 
of creditors must approve the deal. If they do, the women could start 
getting the money by next summer.
