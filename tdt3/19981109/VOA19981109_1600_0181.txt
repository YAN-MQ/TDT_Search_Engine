A Malaysian police official says authorities coerced two people into 
retracting sexual misconduct allegations against former Deputy Prime 
Minister Anwar Ibrahim. At Mr. Anwar's trial, Abdul Aziz Hussein testified 
he and other officers used intense mental pressure on the two accusers 
last year. Mr. Anwar is accused of directing police to force people 
to retract sexual allegations against him. He has pleaded not guilty, 
saying he is the victim of a political conspiracy.
