Police sprayed tear gas and made 20 arrests after a brawl erupted 
between fans of Bucharest's two main rival soccer clubs, several of 
whom were injured, a government official said Monday. After the match 
Sunday which ended 1-1, supporters of home team Steaua soccer club 
flooded onto the pitch and tore Dinamo's banners, angering some of 
Dinamo's 5,000 supporters. Dinamo fans tried to force through a line 
of policemen who were on alert for the match. A brawl ensued and dozens 
of fans fell and were injured, said Col. Gheorghe Bobea of the Interior 
Ministry by telephone. One person was hospitalized overnight. Police 
used tear gas and hosed them down with water to scatter Dinamo's supporters 
who destroyed 200 chairs at Steaua's stadium, Ghencea. Dinamo will 
pay for the damage, Bobea said. Steaua is the defense ministry's team 
and Dinamo belongs to the interior ministry. Some 27,000 people attended 
the match. Rivalry between Steaua and Dinamo's supporters goes back 
years. Both sides have won the Romanian championships several times. 
Soccer violence has increased in recent years with fans clashing on 
stadiums and also on the streets.
