America's automobile industry is having to put its foot on the brakes 
in Asia. Car makers are having to slowdown or risk a crash. From our 
business desk in New York Liz George has details. US car sales fell 
by 2.2 percent in October compared to last year. In Europe, demand's 
falling by as much as 10 percent a year. yet, the car industry's capacity 
to produce continues to increase. More than 37 million cars in 1995 
worldwide, by 1997 the number was 50 million. The results- over supply. 
The car companies big hope for growth had been Asia, but economic 
crisis has hit demand. Exports to the region have fallen by half this 
year. Clearly, something's got to give. And the experts see an increasing 
need to the industry to rationalize which could lead to job losses. 
Surus Spreetin, vice president Booze, Allen, and Hamilton is an authority 
on mergers and alliances. If you really think about the auto industry 
correctly, you'll think about not what is the market in the United 
States or the UK or even Japan or wherever, you'll think about the 
number of people on Earth, because that's really their market. Every 
person can buy and own a car. Now, if you look at it that way, the 
biggest markets are outside the major industrial companies today. 
That's their biggest opportunity. And yet, the amount of money it 
would take to build factories and to really make entries into those 
markets is extraordinary. So, they're beginning to do it with alliance. 
They're doing alliances to make up for some of the lone shortcomings. 
For example, the US automotive companies have a tough time building 
an effective small car, so they do alliances with the Japanese or 
the Europeans to build those small car for them. And this need to 
rationalize is being recognized by a number of tie-ups. The latest 
is the merger between US car giant Chrysler Corporation and Germany's 
Daimler Benz which should reach completion in the next two weeks. 
And as competition bites, car companies are looking to keep their 
cost down elsewhere, too. General Motors has today signed a landmark, 
multi-million dollar agreement to buy substantial amounts of aluminum 
from Alcan Aluminum. The aim is to get predictable prices linked to 
aluminum production rather than rely on the notoriously volatile commodity 
markets. For The World, I'm Liz George in New York.
