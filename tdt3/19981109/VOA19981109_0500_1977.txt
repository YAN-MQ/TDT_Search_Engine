Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again tied Israeli approval 
of a new peace accord towards a Palestinian crackdown on anti-Israeli 
militants. Speaking at a right-wing political rally Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu 
said Israeli will not give up more land unless it gets better security 
in return. But, Israeli media reports say despite last Friday's terrorist 
car bombing, Mr. Netanyahu will reconvene his cabinet this week to 
vote on the new peace accord. After that, the accord would go to Parliament 
for a ratification vote. The Israeli report say US Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright has made clear Washington expects the final ratification 
vote by November 11 or 12th.
