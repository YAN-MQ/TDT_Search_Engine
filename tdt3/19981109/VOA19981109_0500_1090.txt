The National Football League's Minnesota Vikings overcame a pair of 
quarterback injuries to defeat the New Orleans Saints 31 to 24. Randall 
Cunningham was knocked out with a knee injury in the first quarter. 
He was replaced by back-up Brad Johnson. Johnson guided the Vikings 
to victory passing for 316 yards and a touchdown despite suffering 
a broken thumb on his throwing hand in the second quarter. For Johnson, 
being hurt is nothing new. I don't think I'm injured-prone. A lot 
of things like this come up. But, I've taken a lot of hits. When you 
break a bone, there's nothing that you can do about it. The next thing, 
that was a serious injury. The ankle injury, that's a serious injury. 
And I've recovered from both of those. And this is just something 
else I'll have to deal with and move on. If Johnson or Cunningham 
are not available next week, the Vikings will turn to third string 
Jay Feidler who was out of pro football last year.
