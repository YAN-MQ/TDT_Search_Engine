At least one person has been killed and dozen injured in Daka, Bagladesh 
as violence erupted during a general national strike. The Bagladesh 
Nationalist Party and six other opposition parties called for the 
48 hour strike that began at dawn today and shut down much of the 
country. The strike was called to protest the tear-gassing of an opposition 
rally Saturday at which Former Prime Minister Kalen Azea was to speak.
