The Sarazen World Open Gulf Tournament is moving to Europe after being 
played in the United States for the past five years. Tournament officials 
have reached an agreement to include the event on the 1999 European 
tour. Don Padall's, the founder of the tournament, named after golf 
great Gene Sarazen, says the event gives the chance for unknown players 
to make a name for themselves. Somewhere along the way, there will 
be somebody that plays the tournament that keeps going that will win 
this tournament eventually majors, and they're going to come from 
nowhere. They will be maybe from Slovinia or Fiji, or wherever. But 
they and that's what this tournament's about. The new date and venue 
for next year's Sarazen World Open Tournament will be announced in 
December.
