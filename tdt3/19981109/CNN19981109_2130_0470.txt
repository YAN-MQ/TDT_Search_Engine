The American heart association is issuing new guidelines for monitoring 
children and teens taking ritalin and other psychotropic drugs. It 
says the drugs may cause increased heart problems. And there have 
been some reports of sudden death. Ritalin is commonly used to treat 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The new guidelines call 
for a medical history before prescription, an electrocardiogram and 
a complete physical, and doctors should know about any medications 
the patient might be taking which could adversely interact with ritalin.
