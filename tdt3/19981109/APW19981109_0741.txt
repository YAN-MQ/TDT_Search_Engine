The government Monday raised 136 billion escudos (dlrs 797 million) 
through the privatization of a 31 percent stake in the national highway 
operator Brisa _ Auto-Estradas de Portugal. The share issue, which 
was the last major sell-off of the year, brought total revenue for 
privatizations in 1998 to some 785 billion escudos (dlrs 4.5 billion). 
``Once again the strength of the Portuguese capital market has been 
demonstrated by a highly successful share offer, this time in particularly 
difficult international market conditions,'' the Secretary of State 
for Finances, Fernando Teixeira dos Santos, said. The revenue goes 
mostly to paying off the public debt which the government estimates 
will fall to 58 percent of gross domestic product this year, down 
from 61.5 percent last year.
