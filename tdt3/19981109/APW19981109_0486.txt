A memorial commemorating the mass deportation of Berlin's Jews to 
concentration camps was found defaced with swastikas Monday, the 60th 
anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom. Three small swastikas were 
scratched around a Star of David on the metal monument, which was 
erected on a railway bridge in 1987 and has been damaged several times 
since then. It was not known exactly when the latest vandalism occurred, 
police said. Swastikas and neo-Nazi graffiti was also discovered Monday 
sprayed on walls in the eastern city of Schwerin, north of Berlin, 
police said. And just south of Berlin in Potsdam, police reported 
a stone was thrown through a window of a house on the grounds of a 
Jewish cemetery early Monday. Police said it was unclear whether the 
damage was related to the anniversary of the Nov. 9, 1938 ``Night 
of Broken Glass,'' when Nazi storm troopers led attacks on synagogues, 
Jewish businesses and homes across Germany and Austria.
