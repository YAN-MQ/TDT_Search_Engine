It didn't get rave reviews from critics, but audiences seem to like 
Adam Sandler's new movie "the waterboy." Hey, moron! Duhh! Look at 
me, I'm the waterboy. It opened over the weekend with an estimated 
$39.1 million in ticket sales. That's a record for a November or December 
film debut. "The siege" was second, taking in an estimated $14.7 million. 
This is the United States army. You are surrounded. The film stars 
Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis. "Pleasantville" came in third, 
with an estimated $6 million. Just behind that, the restored version 
of "the wizard of Oz," which grossed an estimated $5.5 million. "Antz" 
grabbed the fifth place spot.
