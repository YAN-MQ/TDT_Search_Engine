Germany has been marking the 60th Anniversary of Chris Meldoff to 
the night Nazi stormtroopers ransacked Jewish owned shops and set 
fire to synagogues. This year, there are concerns about a rise with 
anti-Semitism. With more here's Janet Barry. For many here, Consodac 
marks the beginning of the Holocaust. It escalates with Nazi persecution 
of the Jews leading to a wave of violence as synagogue burnt and Jewish 
business were destroyed. At the ceremony in a German synagogue, the 
leader of the Germany's Jewish committee, Iznak Boobis spoke out against 
what he termed "intellectual nationalism", comments directed at one 
German author who said repeated references to the atrocities of the 
Nazis perpetuate German guilt. Janet Barry, BBC News, Berlin.
