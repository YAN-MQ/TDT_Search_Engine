Now let's go to Iraq to Baghdad where the people have been through 
this before, waiting in fear to see what the United States will do 
next. Ron Allen is in the Iraqi capital tonight. As Iraq braces for 
another attack, Tom, the people feel beaten down, desperate an angry 
with America about more threats. Iraqis will tell you, people die 
every day anyway, especially children, because of crippling sanctions, 
shortages of food and medicine for the last eight years, and airstrikes 
can't be any more deadly. From the government, patriotic appeals, 
defiance, no compromise -- warnings that attacks will only make Saddam 
Hussein stronger. So far, no intense preparations for war. Most people 
are more concerned with surviving the misery of day-to-day life. Do 
you have any idea about what the Iraqi military is doing now? Is it 
moving into defensive positions? So far, just small troop movements, 
nothing to match what's happened in the past. Saddam Hussein does 
not think he is about to get hit. He is trying to divide the allies, 
get Kofi Annan to intervene, stopping airstrikes. Saddam trying to 
get out of this still able to make weapons of mass destruction. Thank 
you very much. Ron Allen in Baghdad.
