Central American leaders are meeting today to discuss how to handle 
the devastation caused by hurricane Mitch. They're expected to ask 
world financial organizations to forgive their international debts. 
French officials are suggesting the central American countries be 
offered a moratorium on the debt payments. An estimated 10,000 people 
lost their lives in the storm and its aftermath. So far, the United 
States has committed $70 million in aid, the first of which was distributed 
by U.S. soldiers over the weekend. You've got crops that have been 
destroyed and, in some cases, are going to take a number of years 
to get back up. So then you're talking about no income or work for 
several years. You have to rebuild 20 years of infrastructure. Replaceling 
those roads and bridges. That is going to obviously take a sustained 
effort. President Clinton made a 470 million contribution. Other countries 
also contributed. You're seeing a multinational effort in this initial 
phase of recovery, but it's going to take a very strong commitment 
over the next few years. Former president bush got a first-hand look 
at Mitch's devastation yesterday. He toured parts of Honduras and 
met with President Carlos flores. Bush says he'll push for a continued 
relief effort in central America.
