The credit card has become an indispensable travel tool. It cuts down 
on the cash you need to carry. Many help travelers earn frequent flyer 
miles. Some offer rental car protection. Lori Waffenschmidt explains. 
It's a decision most every traveler faces at the rental counter, whether 
to accept or decline accident coverage. I went ahead and took out 
the insurance. If you're in an accident, you'll likely be covered 
by your own personal car insurance. Your charge card may help, too, 
for free. Credit card companies are always offering different benefits, 
one being car rental isurance. All you have to do is use the car to 
pay for the rental. We cover car rental loss and damage insurance. 
It kicks in after any insurance you already have ends. Some cards 
will cover your deductible. To get the coverage, make sure you're 
using a credit card. Most rental car companies won't accept debit 
cards as pre-payment. Coverage varies greatly. In most cases, it doesn't 
cover anything. The credit card coverage covers you for property damage 
to the automobile, not the liability that would be yours if you injured 
someone. Check with your charge card company before renting to fully 
understand your coverage. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN.
