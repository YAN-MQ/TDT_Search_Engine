The European Union warned the United States Monday not to impose trade 
sanctions to counter the EU's banana import regime, adding Washington 
would face ``extremely damaging consequences.'' The warning followed 
weekend threats from the United States that punitive action may be 
taken if the 15-nation EU does not change its banana trade system, 
which Washington claims unfairly favors imports from former European 
colonies. ``If the U.S. goes down the unilateral road, we believe 
it would have extremely damaging consequences'' for the transatlantic 
relationship, said EU foreign trade spokesman Nigel Gardner. Last 
month, the U.S. administration outlined possible retaliation against 
the European Union if the EU defies a rulings by the World Trade Organization 
on the international banana trade. The London Financial Times said 
Monday Washington would issue a preliminary list of EU products this 
week on which the United States will impose sanctions to retaliate 
against the banana import regime. If Washington goes ahead with the 
move, EU countries are expected to respond in kind, raising the specter 
of a transatlantic trade war, EU officials said. The United States 
is unhappy with the EU's efforts so far to respond to last year's 
negative WTO ruling on the banana regime, which grants favorable treatment 
to a number of African, Caribbean, and Pacific region countries. The 
WTO suit championed banana growers in Latin America who felt discriminated 
by the regime. The EU approved new import regulations in an attempt 
to remedy the situation and bring it into line with WTO regulations. 
But the United States and Latin Americans claim it is still discriminatory.
