Voters in the South Pacific French Colony of New Caledonia have overwhelmingly 
approved a referendum to move the island territory towards independence. 
More than seventy percent of voters endorsed a plan to give broad 
new powers to the archipelago, but it puts off an independent vote 
for 15 or 20 years. Until then, New Caledonians will directly control 
taxes, trade, transport, and communications. French will manage such 
key sectors as defense, justice, and policy.
