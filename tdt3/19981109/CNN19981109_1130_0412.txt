New studies show that music could help rehabilitate people with speech 
and language problems. Researchers presented the findings of three 
different studies on how music affects the brain. One study shows 
the cerebellum is larger in men with musical training than if they 
had no training at all. Two other studies show how different regions 
of the brain respond to the sound of different types of music.
