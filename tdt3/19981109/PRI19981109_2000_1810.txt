Central American leaders are calling on international organizations 
to help them cope with the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. 
More than 10,000 people died in the floods and crops have been completely 
destroyed. Tom Gibb in Honduras reports on the main concern of the 
Central American heads of states. The presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, 
Nicaragua and Costa Rica; along with the Guatemalan foreign minister 
are discussing ways of rebuilding after the disaster. In the short 
term, they want more aid. In the long term, the presidents want economic 
measure which will allow them to help themselves. The most obvious 
is debt relief. Honduras owes just over $4 billion and pays a $1 million 
a day in interest. Nicaragua owes 6 billion. The Salvadoran president 
has also asked for the First World to be more flexible over immigrants. 
Money sent home to family members is crucial to all these economies.
