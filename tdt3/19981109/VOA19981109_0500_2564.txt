The US House Judiciary Committee begins hearings today to determine 
whether President Clinton's alleged wrongdoings rise to a level of 
an impeachable offense. More than a dozen constitutional and historic 
experts have been invited to give their views on the matter as a part 
of an impeachment inquiry authorized last month. President Clinton 
is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in trying to conceal 
his affair with Former White House Intern Monica Lewinsky. The US 
Constitution says a president can be impeached for "high crimes and 
misdemeanors", but does not defied those terms.
