Now with a report on Asian markets, and other business news, here's 
Les Carpenter. Asian stock markets were mostly lower Tuesday. In Japan, 
the Nikkei 225 Index fell a modest 86 points to 14,108 in part from 
concern that a new economic stimulus package is not likely to boost 
the economy out of recession nor help banks reduce their huge debt 
burden. Hong Kong and other Asian markets were also lower. The Hang 
Seng lost 131 points to 9,721. U.S. stocks will begin the day in a 
few hours after a mixed day Monday. The Dow was 78 points lower yesterday 
and will begin today at 8,897. The S&P 500 lost 11 points and will 
open at 1,130. But the NASDAQ composite index continues to climb, 
gaining almost 4.5 points yesterday and will begin today at 1,861. 
The NASDAQ has gained more than 18 points so far this year. That's 
18 percent I should say. Those are not points. Those are percentages.
