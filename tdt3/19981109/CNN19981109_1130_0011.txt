The Supreme Court has ruled against White House attempts to prevent 
presidential aides and secret service agents from testifying just 
as a house subcommittee proceeding on impeachment gets under way. 
19 constitutional experts are sharing their views before the panel. 
The experts will give their opinion on whether Ken Starr's allegations 
against President Clinton constitute impeachable offenses. Charles 
Canady says he rejects the argument that private conduct can't be 
grounds for impeachment. A leading kmeb of the subcommittee disagrees. 
The Supreme Court denied the appeal to keep White House lawyer Bruce 
Lindsey from testifying about confidential information from conversations 
with President Clinton. There is the possibility that Lindsey may 
rely on executive privilege to refuse to answer grand jury questions. 
The Supreme Court refused a White House appeal to prevent secret service 
agents from testifying about what they see and hear while guarding 
the president.
