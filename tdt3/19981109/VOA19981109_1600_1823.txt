History. Additional funding for this series has been provided by The 
National Science Foundation. I'm Jim Nesmith. It is universal time 
and this is VOA News Now. China renews its criticism of Tibet's exiled 
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. A Malaysian police official says 
he helped force two people into retracting allegations against former 
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who's accused of sexual misconduct. 
And Indonesia's top legislative body begins a crucial fourth day of 
meetings considering political reform in our next half hour of VOA

Steve Norman.
