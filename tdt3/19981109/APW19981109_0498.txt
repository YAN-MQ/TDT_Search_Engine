Ciba Specialty Chemicals AG and Clariant announced Monday they will 
merge to form a chemicals giant with a yearly turnover of 18 billion 
Swiss francs (dlrs 13 billion). The merger between the two Swiss based 
firms, worth 20.1 billion francs (dlrs 14.5 billion), will produce 
the world's biggest company making specialty chemicals and dyes. Some 
3,000 jobs of the total 55,000 worldwide will be lost in the process. 
It is hoped to save about 600 mill be called Clariant. Its logo will 
be the butterfly which was Ciba's trademark. Ciba Specialty Chemicals 
was a spin-off from Ciba Geigy. Clariant used to be part of Sandoz 
until it was separated out in 1995. The two former parent companies 
merged in 1996 to form the drug group Novartis. The new company chairman 
will be Rolf Schweizer, current Clariant president. Vice chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer will be Rolf Meyer, the Ciba Speciality 
Chemicals chairman. The decision to go ahead with the merger came 
just six weeks after the two companies' chairmen held their first 
talks on the subject, Schweizer told a news conference. The two companies' 
product portfolios had become increasingly complementary and both 
face ``the same difficulties and challenges,'' he added. The announcement 
said Germany's Hoechst would retain its 45 percent stake in Clariant 
until completion of the merger. This would then be reduced proportionately. 
Ciba and Clariant said the merger will probably be completed in the 
second half of next year. The merger is subject to approval from regulatory 
authorities. Swiss approval is expected in January, said Patrick Ducrey, 
the deputy head of Switzerland's competition commission. ``The merger 
shouldn't really pose any problems,'' he added.
