In New York, attorneys general from several states are apparently 
closing in on a new settlement with the tobacco industry. You may 
remember their original deal was tough on cigarette makers. That deal 
fell apart. This time around, the tobacco industry is feeling a lot 
stronger. Here's ABC's Barry Serafin. a year and a half ago, a small 
group of state attorneys general led by Mississippi's Mike Moore, 
was convinced it had the tobacco industry on the ropes. We had the 
tobacco industry around the neck. I mean, we had tremendous leverage 
over them. We had achieved concessions from them that nobody had ever 
dreamed of. That was then. This is now. The tobacco industry is simply 
not willing to make the type of change now that it was willing to 
make a year ago. The industry is not willing because the threat of 
tobacco legislation died in Congress, partly as a result of a massive 
industry advertising blitz. And partly, many say, because public health 
groups demanded too much. In the process of trying to get more, we 
may have killed the deal that would have changed America. Gregoire 
leads a group of eight attorneys general which has been meeting with 
tobacco company lawyers behind closed doors, trying to reach a Settlement 
of state lawsuits that other attorneys general across the country 
would accept. But expectations have been lowered. And public health 
advocates have been kept out of the talks. This is not a total package 
anymore. It's just a slice of it. The tobacco industry would get a 
better deal this time, sources say, under the proposed plan, the industry 
would pay states about $200 billion over 25 years and pay an additional 
$1.5 billion over the next decade for anti-tobacco advertising. Tobacco 
billboards would be banned, so would advertising on buses and other 
forms of public transportation. There would be a ban on merchandise 
bearing tobacco company brand names and on the use of cartoon characters 
like "Joe camel." But, unlike, the last deal, the companies could 
still sponsor some sports events, they would still be allowed to market 
cigarettes through print advertising and signs in stores and, because 
the industry's position is stronger now, the attorneys general are 
not even asking the companies to agree to what they said they would 
accept last time. Legislation establishing government regulation of 
nicotine. Barry Serafin, ABC News, Washington.
