A musician-turned-businessman who fled Poland in 1991 as a suspect 
in defrauding its central bank of 121 million dollars was released 
from jail Monday on half a million dollars bail. Boguslaw Bagsik, 
the former head of the Art-B corporation, was accused of duping the 
banking system by creating phantom accounts to rack up interest. A 
1991 investigation into Art-B led to the dismissal of the chairman 
of the country's central bank. Bagsik fled Poland for Israel in July 
1991 together with his deputy, Andrzej Gasiorowski. Bagsik was arrested 
in 1994 in Switzerland and extradited to Poland, where he has since 
been in jail. Along with five others, Bagsik has been on trial since 
February. Prosecutors say Bagsik defrauded the central bank of some 
424 million zlotys (dlrs 121 million) in Poland's biggest embezzlement 
fraud since its 1991 transition to a market economy. He is also charged 
with bribing a banking official. Bagsik, as well as Gasiorowski, who 
remains in Israel, has denied any wrongdoing. The Warsaw Provincial 
Court decided to free Bagsik after January Goscimski, representing 
a group of Polish businessmen, paid the bail Monday. In 1991, Art-B, 
a private company dealing in tractors, televisions and other products, 
shot to public attention with its meteoric success. According to Bagsik, 
the company grew from a dlrs 100 investment in 1989 to a corporation 
worth dlrs 500 million with 15,000 employees. It expanded rapidly 
in the early days of post-communist Poland's new market economy.
