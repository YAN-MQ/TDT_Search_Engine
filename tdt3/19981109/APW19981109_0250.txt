A youth was sentenced to life imprisonment Monday for the murder of 
Japanese tourist Michiko Okuyama in the Australian tourist city of 
Cairns last year. The 17-year-old, whose name was suppressed by the 
court because he was aged 16 at the time of the crime, stood motionless 
when Justice Stanley Jones passed sentence in the Queensland state 
Supreme Court in Cairns. He will be eligible for parole in 15 years. 
Okuyama, 22, from Yokohama, was beaten to death in a Cairns warehouse 
in September 1997. Her body was put into a garbage bin and later dumped 
in a swamp. Police said she died from facial fractures and blood inhalation. 
``There was no apparent reason for (Okuyama) to go into the building 
or into the vault where she met her death,'' Jones said during a sentencing 
hearing. ``She was cut off from any hope of receiving help. The attack 
was callous and in my view, premeditated. ``I consider the act to 
be particularly heinous. Acts after (the death) touch on the macabre 
and defy description.'' The murdered woman's parents, Mikio and Toshie 
Okuyama, who had come to Cairns for the trial but were not here for 
the sentencing, said via telephone from Japan that they were not surprised 
at the sentence. ``We have been waiting for this,'' they said. Kevin 
McCreanor, lawyer for the youth, said an appeal had been lodged against 
the life sentence. The youth maintained his innocence throughout the 
trial. Jones said the youth did not suffer from any psychiatric disturbance 
and was intellectually mature. ``There is nothing in your background 
to explain this violent behavior,'' he told the teen-ager. ``You alone 
committed this offense. You presumably are highly dangerous and unpredictable.''
