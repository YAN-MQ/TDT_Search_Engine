Gen. Augusto Pinochet should be freed to return to Chile whose courts 
could then decide whether he has immunity from allegations of genocide, 
murder and torture during his 17-year rule, his lawyers urged in Britain's 
highest court Monday. Outside the House of Lords where five judges 
are hearing a bid to uphold Pinochet's arrest on a Spanish extradition 
warrant, Chilean opponents reacted angrily to a statement by the former 
dictator defending his 1973 overthrow of a Marxist President Salvador 
Allende and saying, ``I am at peace with myself, and with the Chilean 
people.'' ``The ex-dictator ... (has made) not even the most minor 
gesture of repentance for the brutal acts he committed during his 
government,'' the son of Orlando Letelier, Allende's foreign minister 
killed in a 1976 car-bombing in Washington, told reporters. ``He simply 
ignores them,'' added Juan Pablo Letelier, a congressman who is among 
prominent Chileans _ both opponents and supporters of Pinochet _ who 
have come to London to lobby. In court, Clare Montgomery, one of several 
top lawyers appearing for Pinochet, also argued that if the British 
judges upheld the arrest of the 82-year-old general it would imperil 
Chile's fragile democracy. She noted there are 11 proceedings against 
Pinochet in Chile, adding, ``it will be for the court there to decide 
whether he is to be accorded immunity.'' So far, Pinochet has enjoyed 
immunity in his native land as a senator for life and under laws he 
instigated while in office. He stepped down in 1990.
