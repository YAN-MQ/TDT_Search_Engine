The Dow Jones industrial crept into positive territory, then fell 
back as investors wait for a good reason to push the blue chip index 
past the 9,000 level. Right now the Dow is down at this time. The 
NasDAQ is down AS well. Taking a look at the numbers, the Dow off 
82 points and the level is 8992. The broader markets down four points. 
The NASDAQ is down four. All the broader markets are lower. Treasuries 
30-year bellwether bond jumped with the yield at 5.32% partially due 
to the weakness in stocks.
