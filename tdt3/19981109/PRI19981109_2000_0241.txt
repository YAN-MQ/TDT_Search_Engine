Washington has been given an ultimatum from the ruling Taliban in 
Afghanistan. Prove Saudi Dissident Obsana bin Ladin ordered the bombings 
of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania or he's a free man. The 
Taliban say bin Ladin will be declared innocent if evidence is not 
provided with in 10 days. William Reeve has more. Several weeks ago, 
Taliban issued an decree saying they would look into the case of Obsana 
bin Ladin and invited anybody to provide evidence that he was a terrorist. 
The head of the Taliban Supreme Court in Kalbul told the BBC that 
this clearly included an appeal to the United States government. He 
said that under Islamic Sharea law people must provide evidence within 
a time limit, which is now being given. If Obsana bin Ladin is found 
guilty he'll be punished and if not he'll be let off. William Reeve, 
BBC, Kalbul.
