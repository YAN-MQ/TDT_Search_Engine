Garth Brooks' new CD will also be released on the 17th of November, 
but if you can't wait that long go ahead and book a seat on United 
Airlines. If you just can't wait for that new Garth CD, check out 
the folks at United Airlines. They're premiering eight songs for his 
double live stores. Producers of the set say that they have already 
shipped between 7 and 9 million copies of the Garth CD to stores worldwide. 
That's more than for any other album by him or anyone else. And to 
insure all those albums get sold, Garth has quite a few promotions 
planned, including three consecutive specials for NBC Television on 
the 18th. Each program will air live throughout the United States. 
There will be one show for the East Coast, one for the Midwest and 
one for the West Coast. The shows will feature Garth performing and 
taking live questions from fans via the phone and the Internet. Check
