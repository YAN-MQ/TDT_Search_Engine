Energy Secretary Bo Richardson is in Taiwan on a controversial visit, 
which has already angered Mainland China. Top of the agenda-how to 
maintain close US/Taiwanese ties without offending Beijing. Jill McGivering 
reports. The United States denies that a visit by such a high ranking 
official shows any change in policy on Taiwan. Washington switched 
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 and has since 
maintained a delicate balancing act between the two continuing to 
pursue strong economic ties with Taiwan. This visit has already angered 
Beijing and Mainland Chinese officials have formerly protested to 
Washington. Jill McGivering, BBC, Hong Kong.
