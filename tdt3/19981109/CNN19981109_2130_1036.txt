Credit cards help travelers earn frequent-flier miles and cut down 
on the cash they need to carry. Some offer yet another benefit -- 
rental car protection. Lori Waffenschmidt has details, in this edition 
of "working ahead." It's a decision most every traveler faces at the 
rental counter -- Whether to accept or decline accident coverage sold 
by the rental car company. Just for my own pure sanity of mind, I 
went ahead and took out the insurance. But if you're in an accident 
or your car gets stolen, you'll likely be covered by your own personal 
car insurance. And your charge card may help, too, for free. Credit 
card companies are always offering different benefits, one of those 
being car rental insurance. All you have to do is use the car to pay 
for the rental. We offer car rental loss and damage insurance, which 
is actually excess insurance, meaning that it kicks in after any insurance 
you already have ends. Some cards also will cover your deductible. 
To get the coverage, make sure you're using a credit card. Most rental 
car companies won't accept debit cards as prepayment. Coverage varies 
greatly from card to card. And, in most cases, it doesn't cover everything. 
The credit card coverage covers you for property damage to the automobile, 
not the liability that would be yours if you injured someone. Check 
with your charge card company before renting to fully understand your 
coverage. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN.
