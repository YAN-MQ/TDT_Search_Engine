Finally from us tonight, a question that many teenagers and careful 
readers of "the Wall Street Journal" know the answer to. What do you 
get when you cross a pair of sneakers with a skateboard? The answer 
is a shoe with a warning label. A particularly ominous warning label. 
Here is ABC's Jane Clayson. "soaps," as they're called by the first 
company to produce them, are the latest trend in teenage athletic 
shoes. They're sneakers with a concave plastic plate screwed into 
the arch. Kids use them to grind or slide along handrails, ledges, 
curbs -- anything with an edge. Soaps are just pretty cool. Something 
to mess around in when you're not rollerblading, skateboarding, biking, 
whatever. But the trendy new sneaker comes with a warning label. Users 
run, "the risk of serious bodily harm, including head and spinal injury 
or death." Nothing but ankle sprains and joint injuries reported so 
far. Soaps are a hit among thrill-seekers who can no longer perform 
their stunts on skateboards or in-line skates, which are banned in 
many public places. So retailers cannot keep the shoes on the shelves. 
Demand for soaps has tripled in the last year. We do sell a lot of 
them. Actually, just waiting for our Christmas shipment. There's been 
a lot of phone calls daily wondering when they'll be in stock. The 
30-something co-founder of the company is a former investment banker 
with a Harvard MBA. He is marketing soaps to teenage boys, age 12 
to 18. They spend an average of $90 a week. That's a $120 million-A-year 
industry. And we've captured their imagination. Only a year into production, 
soaps are selling in 22 countries around the world, Ringing in $10 
million in sales. A new generation of shoes for a new generation of 
kids. Jane Clayson, ABC News.
