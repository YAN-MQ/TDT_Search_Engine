About 4,000 teachers at government-run high schools across Lebanon 
walked out of classrooms Monday for an indefinite strike to press 
for better pensions. The strike affected 193 public schools, leaving 
more than 65,000 high school students without classes. The teachers 
will be joined Tuesday by their colleagues in junior public schools, 
newspapers reported Monday. This would force about 250,000 students 
to stay home. Those affected are only a fraction of the 1 million 
students in Lebanon because private institutions and universities 
did not join the strike. State-run Beirut Radio said the strike was 
``totally'' observed by public schools across the country. The teachers' 
union is demanding end-of-service compensation to be calculated on 
the basis of their last full salaries. The government proposed and 
the Parliament approved last month pensions equal to 85 percent of 
the last income. ``The strike will continue until the demands of the 
teachers' union are met,'' union leader Fuad Saab told reporters Monday. 
The government, strapped by a budget deficit and debt, has already 
said it cannot afford to meet the demands. Teachers' pay varies greatly 
depending on education and experience. Monthly salaries run from dlrs 
250 to dlrs 1,000 in public schools and from dlrs 550 to dlrs 1,000 
in private ones.
