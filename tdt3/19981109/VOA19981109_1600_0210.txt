Indonesia's top legislative body has begun a key four-day meeting 
to consider political reforms. The People's Consultative Assembly 
meeting under heavy guard in Jakarta is expected to life restrictions 
on political parties and open campaigning. The Indonesian military 
says three of its soldiers have been killed during a clash in the 
troubled territory of East Timor. Military officials say one civilian 
was also killed when a mob attacked a military outpost Monday. The 
violence comes as East Timor prepares to mark the seventh anniversary 
of the Deley massacre when Indonesian troops fired at a funeral procession.
