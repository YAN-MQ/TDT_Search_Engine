Military officials are adding troops and preparing a naval blockade 
to prevent a group of Muslim extremists from escaping before an expected 
massive rescue attempt for three kidnapped foreigners, a government 
negotiator said Monday. Munib Estino, governor of Sulu province, said 
the government has given the kidnappers until Tuesday to free two 
Hong Kong citizens and one Malaysian who have been held captive since 
Sept. 8. An order to storm the suspected kidnappers' jungle hideout 
may be given any time after Tuesday, he said. Estino, one of the government's 
chief negotiators, said the ultimatum was given because the talks 
were ``going nowhere.'' The kidnappers are demanding dlrs 1.5 million 
and the government is unwilling to pay any ransom, he said. Munib 
said the captives, Law Cheung Yau and So Chi Ming of Hong Kong and 
Tong Ket Ming of Malaysia, were buying live fish for sale to Hong 
Kong restaurants when they were seized from an island in Tawi-tawi 
province near the Philippine boundary with the east Malaysian state 
of Sabah, about 1,040 kilometers (650 miles) south of Manila. Authorities 
say the kidnappers are members of the extremist Abu Sayyaf Muslim 
group and disgruntled former members of the Moro National Liberation 
Front, which signed a peace accord with the government two years ago. 
A senior officer said 500 soldiers will be added to the 1,000 soldiers 
already in the area to prevent the estimated 200 rebels from escaping 
by land, while several naval patrol boats are patrolling the coast 
to stop the kidnappers from fleeing by sea. Lt. Gen. Angelo Reyes, 
commander of the military's Southern Command, said the government 
will ``put some military pressure on the kidnappers so they will release 
the victims.'' Reyes said an assault order is an option but ``the 
safety of the foreigners is our main concern.'' Meanwhile, talks are 
continuing for the freedom of Italian missionary priest Luciano Benedetti, 
who was kidnapped in Sibuco, northwest of Zamboanga, by another suspected 
Muslim rebel group on the same day the three other foreigners were 
seized. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the group suspected by 
the government to be involved in Benedetti's abduction, has denied 
any role in the kidnapping. A day later, the mother and family of 
a Taiwanese businessman were also abducted in Zamboanga City. In the 
Manila area, police arrested 14 alleged kidnappers and killed another 
suspect during the rescue Monday of businesswoman Michelle Siu Ragos 
in suburban Las Pinas. Ragos was kidnapped in Valenzuela, also a Manila 
suburb, on Oct. 30. Gen. Panfilo Lacson, chief of the Presidential 
Anti-Organized Crime Task Force, said police are pursuing three other 
members of the kidnap group, including its alleged leader, who fled 
with 4.83 million pesos (dlrs 120,750) in ransom.
