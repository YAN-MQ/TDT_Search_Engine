Portuguese voters have rejected a proposal to create administrative 
regional assemblies, delivering a blow to the minority Socialist government 
which strongly backed the plan while handing a political victory to 
rightist opposition parties which opposed it. In a referendum Sunday, 
more than 63 percent of voters turned down the proposal while only 
37 percent favored it, according to official results published Monday. 
With just 12,400 votes still to count, the abstention rate stood at 
50.8 percent among the country's 8.4 million voters. Prime Minister 
Antonio Guterres, who billed the proposal as ``the reform of the century'' 
and who campaigned hard for it to be accepted, acknowledged that the 
result was ``a personal political defeat.'' ``But I don't think this 
referendum should be confused with elections for the government or 
for president,'' Guterres told reporters. The main opposition party 
in parliament, the center-right Social Democrat Party, said it would 
not use the government's defeat to call for early general elections, 
which are scheduled for next fall. ``Portugal needs stability,'' Social 
Democrat leader Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said. ``Stability means a 
government ruling until October 1999 and the opposition monitoring 
it and preparing an alternative for next year.'' He added that neither 
would his party seek to block the passage of the 1999 budget, due 
to be voted in parliament this month. The Popular Party, a small rightist 
party which is mulling an alliance with the Social Democrats, was 
more critical, insisting the referendum outcome showed that the Socialist 
Party ``was not invincible.'' The Socialists have won the last general, 
presidential, municipal and European parliament elections, though 
they are four seats short of an absolute majority in the single-chamber 
parliament. Their popularity has remained high in recent opinion polls, 
obtaining almost 50 percent compared with less than 40 percent for 
the Social Democrats. The proposal, which was also backed by the opposition 
Communist Party, would have created an intermediate level of government 
by devolving limited administrative powers to elected assemblies in 
eight regions. The proposed assemblies were to be responsible for 
administration, planning and development in their areas after coordinating 
policy with the central government and local councils.
