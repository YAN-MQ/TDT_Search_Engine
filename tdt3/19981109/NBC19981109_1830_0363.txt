But then, what does all of this mean for President Clinton and impeachment? 
More trouble for him on that front today, and from the White House 
tonight, NBC's David Bloom. David? Tom, bad news for the president 
on three fronts tonight -- house republicans appear intent on moving 
ahead with impeachment hearings, the Supreme Court says secret service 
agents and the president's lawyers may have to testify, and justice 
department lawyers interview Mr. Clinton with an eye toward appointing 
another independent counsel. Day one of impeachment hearings. Legal 
scholars debate whether perjury is an impeachable offense. Legal scholars 
debate there perjury is an impeachable defense. But the republican 
charge answers yes. And despite the country's anti-impeachment mood, 
vows to press on. All of the sophistries that I hear, rationales, 
justifications, "everybody does it, "it was just about sex," it's 
perjury. "I swear to tell the truth." The whole system of justice 
depends on that. Doesn't it? And the Supreme Court, two major victories 
for Ken Starr. The high court let stand two lower court rulings which 
say that when the prosecutor's investigating a possible crime, secret 
service employees and the president's lawyers can not refuse to testify. 
The president himself returning from camp David today was questioned 
for an hour and a half. But justice department lawyers and two FBI 
agents. At issue, did Mr. Clinton break campaign spending limits by 
unlawfully directing an ad campaign during the 1996 presidential race. 
Janet Reno has until December 7th to decide whether to seek an independent 
counsel. tom? David Bloom at the White House tonight.
