A hospital unit where contaminated water was pumped into the dialysis 
machines of six kidney patients, killing three of them, will remain 
shut until improvements are made, Hong Kong's health department said 
Monday. ``A multitude of factors acted together to result in the event,'' 
the health department said after concluding its investigation into 
the incident at the private Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital. The 
dialysis unit has been closed since the fatal blunders were made on 
Aug. 20. The health department said it was unable to publicly declare 
what improvements are necessary, citing legal concerns surrounding 
inquests into the deaths. The incident was the latest in a spate of 
hospital accidents over the past year, some fatal, stirring concerns 
over the safety of health care in Hong Kong.
