And a trial gets under way in Washington today. The trial of Joe camel. 
The federal trade commission is seeking a permanent ban on advertisement 
that features Joe camel even though R.J. Reynolds voluntarily withdrew 
Joe from ads a year ago. The FTC alleges the company committed unfair 
trade practice by using the character to attract minors to smoking. 
It wants them to pay for a consumer education program.
