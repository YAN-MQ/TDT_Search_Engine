Women who make it to the top of the corporate world apparently still 
face a Gender pay gap. A survey by the nonprofit group catalyst shows 
the nation's highest paid female executives make 68 cents to every 
$1 earned by the highest paid men. That's a wider gap than in the 
U.S. workforce as a whole, where women earned 76 cents for every $1 
men made in the first quarter of this year. On average, the median 
compensation for female executives was about $519,000, compared to 
$765,000 for male executives.
