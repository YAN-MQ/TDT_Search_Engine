The food and drug administration is requiring new warning labels for 
steroids used to treat allergies and asthma. The labels will state 
that the drugs can stunt growth in children. The FDA is also recommending 
doctors only prescribe the lowest effective dose and monitor the growth 
of young patients. Many of these drugs already carry such warning 
labels after a similar FDA recommendation was issued in August.
