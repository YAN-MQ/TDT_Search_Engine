Drew Carey might be a big hit here in the United States, but how does 
his brand of humor play in China? Rebecca mackinnon has the story. 
This is no ordinary tourist, but then China is no ordinary place to 
shoot a situation comedy. It's "the drew Carey show" -- transplanted 
from middle America to the middle kingdom. The premise -- an ordinary 
American working man, in a crazy practical joke, gets drugged and 
wakes up in China? I can't think of a worse place to be. Without a 
passport, without any money, then you'd be really screwed. Figuring 
out how to get back home isn't easy. One of his shoes is stolen and 
nobody understands him. What is that? Where did you get that? Fortunately, 
for this meat and potatoes kind of guy, China at least has McDonald's. 
You've run from there. I'm going to pick you up right about here. 
This is the first time an American situation comedy has ever been 
shot in China. To the amusement of many onlookers, American tourists 
all wanted pictures. But the cultural relics police were not so amused 
about Carey lying down on top of an ancient stone carving. They said 
he would have to pay a fine. We thought, "okay, we had a permit for 
this, we are ready for this. We are going to be here on a certain 
day at a certain time and everybody knows, right? Y, everybody knows. 
We show up and they go, what are you doing here? The authorities weren't 
about to give up. They stopped the filming, but only after most of 
the scene was already shot. Fortunately, for drew Carey, they didn't 
make him pay the fine. Rebecca mackinnon, CNN, Beijing.
