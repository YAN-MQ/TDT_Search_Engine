From Public Radio International, this is the world. A co-production 
of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH Boston. It's Monday November 
9th. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, the Clinton Administration wonders about 
public support for a military strike against Iraq. Also, American 
aide in Central America, a familiar debate in Europe and tasty worms 
in Africa. The people there were picking them off the trees and squeezing 
out their very bright green guts. Then, putting them in water with 
salt, boiling them down a bit, drying them in the sun, and you have 
in your hand now a very dry, very high protein snack. First, this 
news. For the world, this Pamela McCall in the BBC NewsRoom in London.
