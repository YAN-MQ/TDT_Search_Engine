It's week four of the government's antitrust case against Microsoft. 
And the attention shifts to the software maker's relationship with 
chip giant Intel. The government played more videotaped testimony 
by Microsoft chief Bill gates in court today. In it, Gates denies 
his company tried to keep Intel out of the software market. Intel's 
development of a new type of software was halted in 1995, after a 
Meeting between Gates and Intel's then CEO Andy Grove. Intel's chips 
power about 90% of the world's personal computers. But software makes 
up just a small part of its business.
