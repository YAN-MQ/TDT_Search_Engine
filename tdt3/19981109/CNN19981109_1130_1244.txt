Quarterback problems in Minnesota. I'm Anthony Keith James, and this 
is "CNN Headline Sports." So who's the Vikings starting quarterback. 
Randall Cunningham will have arthroscopic surgery today after twisting 
his right knee in Sunday's win over the saints. His backup Brad Johnson 
ended up with a broken thumb on his throwing hand. We gotta be positive. 
We'll see what's going on with Brad's thumb. It's serious. Depending 
on how serious. And we'll see what's going on with Randall Cunningham's 
knee. And his is serious, too.
