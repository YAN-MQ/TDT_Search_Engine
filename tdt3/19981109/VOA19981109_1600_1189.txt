The Vikings will start third string quarterback J. Fiedler this Sunday 
against the Cincinnati Bengals because of injuries to Randall Cunningham 
and Brad Johnson. Fielder was out of pro football over the past two 
seasons. Cunningham went down in the first quarter of Sunday's game 
against the New Orleans Saints with a knee injury and is expected 
to miss at least one game. Brad Johnson led the Vikings to victory 
over the Saints but suffered a broken thumb and is expected out for 
at least two weeks, perhaps one month.
