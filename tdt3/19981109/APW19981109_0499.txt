Richie Woodhall is set to defend his WBC super-middleweight title 
against Italy's Vincenzo Nardiello by the end of January. The two 
were orginally set to fight on Sept. 5, but the bout was called off 
when Nardiello pulled out, citing a calf injury. Woodhall went on 
to retain his title in a close decision against former British middleweight 
champion Glenn Catley. The Nardiello fight is expected to take place 
in Telford, Woodhall's home town, in early January. Woodhall will 
be making the second defense of the title he won by defeating South 
Africa's Thulane ``Sugar Boy'' Malinga last March.
