A Bosnian Serb who was imprisoned for advocating a unified Bosnia 
burned the country's flag in downtown Sarajevo, protesting the role 
of the international community in Bosnia. Vladimir Srebrov, a writer 
before and a political activist during and after the 1992-1995 war 
in Bosnia, was one of the founders of the Serb Democratic Party, later 
run by war-crimes suspect No. 1, Radovan Karadzic. Srebrov distanced 
himself from the party before the fighting started and continued to 
work against it till he was jailed by the Bosnian Serbs as a ``traitor 
of the Serb cause''. According to the Bosnian news agency BH Press, 
Srebrov said his intention was to symbolically ``burn'' the influence 
of the office of Carlos Westendorp, the chief international envoy 
to Bosnia, and other international organizations.
