National Basketball Association team owners and players will spend 
this week waiting each other out rather than negotiate a collective 
bargaining agreement to win their labor dispute. No plans for bargaining 
sessions during the most recent meeting last Friday which lasted only 
90 minutes. Games through December 7th are canceled and the sixth 
week of the season is threatened. That's sports. I'm Ray Kouguell.
