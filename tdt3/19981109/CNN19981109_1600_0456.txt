This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Tuesday morning. Heavy snow accompanied by blustery 
winds, a blizzard, if you will, is scheduled to move out of the northern 
Rockies through the northern plains states and through the midwest 
overnight tonight and during the day tomorrow. Snowfall amounts will 
be extremely heavy -- eight to ten inches in some places and wind 
speeds of 35 miles an hour, in excess of that, actually. And all along 
the cold front as it moves into the east, the threat of showers and 
thunderstorms, even the possible of severe weather. Now it will be 
cold in association with this system. Day-time highs only in the 30s 
in many places. As far as your extended forecast is concerned, on 
Wednesday, you can see how the storm continues to move through the 
east, but lots of rain and thunderstorms, very little snowfall. That 
will Hang back in the Great Lakes area. A new weather system will 
be moving in through the northwest. You can see that weather system 
moving inland, however it is expected to be much weaker than the system 
coming in through tonight and tomorrow. By Friday, you can see a widespread 
area of rainfall for the east and the midwest. That's the latest look 
at your maps. For more weather information, log onto CNN.com for four-day
