Baseball's most dominating Rookie right-hander to come along since 
another hard throwing Texan named Clemens, Kerry wood has been named 
national league Rookie of the year. The Chicago flamethrower burst 
onto the scene in early may with a 20-strikeout performance against 
the astros, and helped lead the cubs to their first postseason appearance 
since 1989. That helped wood beat out the Rockies' Todd helton for 
top honors among first year players by just one first-place vote. 
There was a trade in the majors today. The Phillies reduced their 
payroll by sending Mark leiter to the mariners for reliever Paul spoljaric. 
Leiter is expected to join Seattle's starting rotation. The news is 
not good for "catfish" Hunter. The 52-year-old hall of famer has been 
diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and will begin treatment for the 
fatal illness this week.
