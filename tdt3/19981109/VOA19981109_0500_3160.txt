Tuesday's election results in the United States may give President 
Clinton's credibility a boost when he attends the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Meeting in Malaysia scheduled for later this month. A

President Clinton will be impeach over the sex and perjury scandal 
involving a former White House intern".
