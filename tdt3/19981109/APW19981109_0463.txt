Israeli warplanes fired at least one missile on suspected guerrilla 
bases in southern Lebanon Monday, Lebanese security officials said. 
There was no immediate word on casualties from the afternoon raid 
on a valley between the Shiite Muslim villages of Yater and Jebal 
al-Boutom. The area, around 15 kilometers (nine miles) south of the 
port city of Tyre, is often used by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas 
to launch attacks on Israeli troops occupying a border enclave in 
South Lebanon. The attack came after Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed 
an Israeli outpost at Blatt, some three kilometers (2 miles) north 
of the Israeli border, the officials said. They spoke on customary 
condition of anonymity. A Hezbollah statement said the mortar attack 
caused ``definite casualties.'' There was no immediate word from Israel 
on the guerrilla attack or the Israeli air raid. On Sunday, Israeli 
helicopters and artillery fired on suspected guerrilla hideouts after 
Lebanese guerrillas attacked Israeli-backed militiamen in the south. 
Hezbollah leads a guerrilla warfare to oust some 1,500 Israeli forces 
and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the enclave, which Israel 
established in 1985 to guard against cross-border guerrilla attacks.
