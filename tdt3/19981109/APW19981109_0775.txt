BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union foreign ministers on Monday 
considered granting debt relief to Central American nations hit by 
Hurricane Mitch as part of an aid package to help them overcome the 
devastation. EU foreign ministers said the EU should unblock further 
emergency aid for Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, 
where torrential rains and mudslides have killed an estimated 10,000 
people and left tens of thousands of others without food and shelter. 
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country currently 
holds the EU presidency, said the Union and its the 15 member nations 
have pledged over dlrs 70 million so far in humanitarian aid for Central 
America. But over the past few days the extent of the devastation 
has proved to be greater than expected. German Foreign Minister Joschka 
Fischer told reporters urgent measures are needed to provide victims 
with basic aid, including medicine, water sanitation and shelter. 
The ministers were debating the possibility of unblocking emergency 
funds from the EU's common foreign and security policy budget. In 
the longer term, the ministers have asked the EU executive Commission 
to come up with a series of proposals to help reconstruction. These 
measures could include forgiving the country's foreign debts or delaying 
their reimbursement. ``It's an interesting proposal but it's not the 
only one,'' Ramon de Miguel, Spain's state secretary for foreign affairs. 
The four Central American countries have foreign debts totaling around 
dlrs 20 billion, mainly to international lending agencies. Honduras 
owes dlrs 4.2 billion and Nicaragua owes dlrs 6 billion. De Miguel 
said the ministers have asked the EU executive Commission to come 
forward with a series of proposals by November 30, when development 
ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels. Both De Miguel and Fischer 
stressed that the EU and the United States should coordinate aid efforts 
for the stricken region.
