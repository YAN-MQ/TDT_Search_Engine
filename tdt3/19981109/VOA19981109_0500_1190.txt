And scramble for US college football's top ranking is on after previously 
unbeaten Ohio State was stunned on Saturday in a rare loss at home. 
Kansas State grabbed the top ranking in this week's poll of coaches 
while Tennessee was voted number one by the Associated Press. Michigan 
State devastated Ohio State's bid for a National Title by defeating 
the Buckeyes 28-24. The loss sent Ohio State tumbling to number 7 
in both weekly polls. Kansas State was in position to take advantage 
of the Buckeye's misfortune after trouncing Baylor 49-6. Tennessee 
remained unbeaten with a 37-13 victory over Alabama Birmingham. Ohio 
State Coach John Cooper says he's not sure his team still has a shot 
at the title. I don't know if we have a chance to win the National 
Championship. I mean a lot of things have got to happen for us to 
get back into the Fiesta Bowl picture. There's no question about that. 
Both polls agree on the rest of the teams in the top five. UCLA is 
slowing climbing back to the top of the number three ranking, followed 
by Florida and Florida State.
