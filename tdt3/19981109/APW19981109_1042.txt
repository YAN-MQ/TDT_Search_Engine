Kerry Wood was narrowly voted Rookie of the Year for North American 
baseball's National League on Monday, capping a season in which he 
struck out 20 batters in a game and helped the Chicago Cubs make the 
playoffs for the first time since 1989. The 21-year-old right-hander 
received 16 first-place votes and 16 seconds to finish with 128 points 
in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America for the 
award, which honors the best first-year player. Colorado Rockies first 
baseman Todd Helton got 15 firsts, 14 seconds and two thirds for 119 
points. Arizona first baseman Travis Lee was next with 21 points and 
Atlanta closer Kerry Ligtenberg, who received the other first-place 
vote, was fourth with 18 points. Wood was 13-6 with a 3.40 earned 
run average in 26 starts, striking out 233 in 166 2-3 innings. He 
was even more impressive at Wrigley Field, going 9-1 with a 2.97 ERA 
in 13 starts during the regular season. Baseball took notice of Wood 
on May 6 when he struck out 20 _ only Roger Clemens had done it in 
a nine-inning game _ while pitching a one-hitter against Houston. 
He was the odds-on favorite to win the rookie award heading into the 
final month of the season. But because of a dead arm, his start against 
Cincinnati on Aug. 31 was his last of the regular season. Wood returned 
in Game 3 of the NL playoffs, allowing one run _ not earned _ against 
Atlanta as the Cubs were eliminated. Helton batted .315 with 25 homers 
and 97 runs batted in, taking over at first base for the Rockies after 
Andres Galarraga left to sign with Atlanta following the 1997 season. 
Ligtenberg replaced Mark Wohlers as the Braves' closer and finished 
with 30 saves. The Rookie of the Year award for the American League, 
the other of two leagues in North American Major League Baseball, 
will be announced Tuesday. Oakland outfielder Ben Grieve and New York 
Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez are the favorites.
