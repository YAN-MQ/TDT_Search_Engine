The European Union is cobbling together plans to grant Russia dlrs 
480 million in food aid though some EU nations raised questions Monday 
about giving food to a country that still exports wheat and where 
evidence of food shortages is spotty. The EU executive Commission 
also proposed a package of humanitarian assistance for Russia of dlrs 
8.4 million. On food aid, it proposed a package of cereals, meat and 
milk powder to be sold in Russia at market prices with the proceeds 
going into a fund to finance social projects. The EU would pay its 
farmers for the food delivered to Russia. The value of the aid would 
be 400 million European currency units (dlrs 480 million). The EU 
plan _ broadly endorsed at a meeting here of the EU foreign ministers 
_ was put forward four days after the United States announced it would 
provide Russia with food aid worth dlrs 600 million. ``It is a clear 
signal of our political and material support for Russia,'' EU Foreign 
affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek told reporters. He added, 
``We need to ensure that this (EU) aid reaches its destination and 
that it does not distort traditional trade flows.'' Russia was expected 
to formally request food aid in a matter of days. EU officials will 
go to Moscow this week to examine projects that could receive humanitarian 
assistance. Russia will be held to strict conditions, officials said. 
It must provide anti-fraud guarantees, it cannot re-export EU food 
and must ensure the food reaches the needy. The EU ``looks to the 
Russian government to take the administrative measures necessary to 
facilitate'' distribution of the aid, the foreign ministers said. 
The EU foreign ministers did not debate the measure in detail but 
the Netherlands and Britain suggested the EU tread carefully. ``There 
is not a general food shortage in Russia,'' said Dutch Foreign Minister 
Jozias van Aartsen. ``We have to be careful. Russia is still selling 
grain on world markets.'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said 
``evidence is conflicting'' as to size of food shortages across Russia. 
He said ``generalized food shortages'' may come only after the New 
Year adding it was right for the EU to plan now since it will take 
two months before the first shipments will reach Russia. It was expected 
the EU package will be finalized in the weeks ahead to give the EU 
leaders the opportunity to make a formal announcement when they meet 
Dec. 11-12 in Vienna, Austria. The EU stock of surplus grain is currently 
about 10 million tons. In addition it has some 500,000 tons of beef 
and 400,000 tons of rice in surplus stocks. Russia has been hit hard 
by economic problems coupled with the worst grain harvest in 40 years. 
Food prices have risen 50 percent due to the financial crisis, prompting 
worries that the poor won't be able to afford food. Russian officials 
have said their emergency reserve will last only two to three weeks.
