The judge presiding over Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit urged 
both parties to settle five months before she dismissed the case. 
That information comes from documents released today. On October 29th, 
1997, judge Susan Webber Wright also told both sides she would not 
allow a parade of witnesses testifying about Jones and Mr. Clinton's 
sex lives. On April 1st, Wright dismissed the suit -- a decision that's 
being appealed.
