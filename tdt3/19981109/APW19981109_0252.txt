Teams from India and the United States began talks Monday on controlling 
nuclear technology in South Asia. The two-days of talks will deal 
with export controls on nuclear technology, officials said. The U.S. 
delegation travels to Pakistan on Tuesday. The meeting follows an 
announcement in Washington that President Bill Clinton will lift some 
of the economic sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan after they 
detonated nuclear devices in May. The U.S. government cited progress 
on enlisting the support of the two countries in nonproliferation 
issues. The U.S. delegation, headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of State John Barker, was looking at the controls India has adopted 
to ensure its nuclear know-how and equipment is not given to third 
countries. In 10 days, senior representatives from the two countries 
will meet in Rome for the sixth time since the atomic tests. The U.S. 
government is trying to get Indian and Pakistani signatures on the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty within the next 10 months.
