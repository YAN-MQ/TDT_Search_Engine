Hundreds of children from primary schools in Muslim-dominated eastern 
Mostar cast flowers Monday into the Neretva River, marking the fifth 
anniversary of the destruction of the city's famous Old Bridge. The 
gorgeous 430-year-old, one-span bridge _ long considered a cultural 
monument _ was under the protection of UNESCO when it was destroyed 
in 1993 by Bosnian Croat artillery during the conflict between Bosnia's 
Muslims and Croats. The United Nations Educational Scientific and 
Cultural Organization tracks and helps protect so-called ``Heritage 
Sites'' around the world. Bridge reconstruction started earlier this 
year, and local officials say the effort will cost approximately 14 
million dollars. The World Bank has already provided some 4 million 
dollars. The rest of the money has been pledged by several countries, 
including the United States, Germany, Italy, Spain and Turkey. Reconstruction 
work will last several years. So far, some 60 percent of the original 
building materials have been recovered from the river. Initially allies 
against Bosnian Serbs, the Croats and Muslims turned against each 
other and spent a year fighting for domination in central and southern 
Bosnia. Since the Dayton peace accord stopped the fighting in late 
1995, Bosnian Croats and Muslims share one of the two country's substates, 
the Muslim-Croat federation. Hard-liners on both sides continue following 
their nationalist goals. Towns like Mostar, where Bosnian Croats and 
Muslims fought for control during the war, remain divided.
