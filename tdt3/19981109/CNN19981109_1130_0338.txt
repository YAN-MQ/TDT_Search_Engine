Iraq was the topic as the president met at camp David with defense 
secretary William Cohen, national security adviser Sandy Berger and 
secretary of state Madeleine Albright. A national security council 
spokesman says the president reviewed the diplomatic and military 
options with them and asked for a follow-up on both fronts. President 
Saddam Hussein has declared an end to Iraq's cooperation with the 
U.N. weapons inspectors. Iraq's trade minister says his country has 
suffered so long under the U.N. sanctions, it has nothing to fear 
from new U.S. threats.
