Bomb explosions and a drive-by shooting have left two people dead 
and others critically injured, ending a brief respite from violence 
in Algeria, newspaper reports said Monday. A car bomb exploded Sunday 
in an attack on a highway west of Algiers, killing the driver and 
critically injuring a passenger, the newspaper Liberte reported Monday. 
In a separate incident Sunday, an unspecified number of people were 
injured when mortar fire hit the center of Blida, about 50 kms (30 
miles) south of the Algerian capital. Neither attack was confirmed 
by Algerian authorities, the newspaper said. The recent attacks come 
a few weeks away from the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, 
which has been marked by violence in Algeria since 1992. The weekend 
incidents follow two attacks last week. On Wednesday, one person was 
killed and another injured after a bomb exploded at a work site at 
the national gas and electricity company in Bedjaia in north central 
Algeria, the New Republic newspaper reported. On the same day, a civil 
servant was critically injured after armed militants shot at his car, 
which was also transporting a politician from the Rally for National 
Democracy (RND) party, the newspaper said. There was no claim of responsibility 
for the attacks, but blame is usually attributed to Islamic militants 
waging an insurgency against Algeria's military-backed government. 
An estimated 75,000 people have died in the violence which began after 
authorities canceled 1992 legislative elections in which the now banned 
Islamic Salvation Front was headed for victory.
