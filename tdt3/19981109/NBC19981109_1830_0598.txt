And now to the situation in Iraq, where U.N. weapons inspectors continue 
to pull out tonight, in the face of Saddam Hussein's refusal to cooperate. 
In Washington, hopes for any sort of diplomatic way out of this situation 
are dwindling fast. We have a report from Baghdad straight ahead, 
but let's begin at the pentagon, where NBC's Jim Miklaszewski is standing 
by. jim? The military plan to punish Saddam Hussein with airstrikes 
is done. All it would take now is the order from President Clinton 
to send the missiles flying toward Iraq. More U.N. weapons inspectors 
left Baghdad today, but 100 still remain as U.S. airstrikes against 
Iraq now appear increasingly inevitable. At the White House, with 
a growing sense of urgency, President Clinton's top foreign policy 
team met for the second time in two days to consider the options. 
Airstrikes could be launched almost immediately with cruise missiles 
from navy warships and B-52s already on alert. Airstrikes would be 
aimed at forcing Saddam to once again comply with weapons inspections, 
or, failing that, cripple his weapons program that he could never 
recover. Every day that passes by is a day in Iraq's favor. A day 
that Iraq can build and squirrel away weapons of mass destruction. 
The targets, already picked and programmed into the missiles. First, 
the Iraqi military and elite republican guard that keep Saddam in 
power. Next, much of Iraq's industrial complex -- anything that could 
support production of chemical and biological weapons. That includes 
more than 170 secret sites, and some of Saddam's presidential palaces, 
suspected hiding places for his chemical and biological weapons program. 
President Clinton's decision is expected within a few days, but tonight, 
sources tell NBC news the Pentagon has canceled an upcoming congressional 
trip for a higher priority -- the airplane may now be needed to Ferry 
U.S. servicemen to the gulf. tom? Thanks very much. Jim Mick McAt 
the Pentagon.
