Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again tied Israeli approval 
of a new peace accord to a Palestinian crack-down on anti-Israeli 
militants. He made the commenst Sunday at a right wing political rally. 
Israeli media reports say despite last Friday's terrorist car bombing, 
Mr. Netanyahu's cabinet will vote this week on the peace accord. The 
accord will then go to parliament for a ratification vote. The report 
say Washington has made it clear that it expects a vote by November 
11th or November 12th.
