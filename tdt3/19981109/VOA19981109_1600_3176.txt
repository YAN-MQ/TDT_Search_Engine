As the Asia Pacific Economic Forum meeting opens next week in Malaysia, 
President Clinton may be ready to present a plan to help Asia Pacific 
nations restructure corporate debt and recapitalize their banks. One 
official says the U.S. wants to put a plan on the table which shows 
U.S. engagement and responsiveness to the Asian economic crisis. Mr. 
Clinton will leave this Saturday to join the other Asia Pacific leaders 
for the meeting in Kuala Lumpur November 17th and 18th.
