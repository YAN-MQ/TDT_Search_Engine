A University of Michigan study says it's more work and less play for 
american kids. The study found children's free play time accounted 
for 30% of their day last year. That's down from 40% in 1981. The 
author of the study says extracurricular programs are fine as long 
as children also have time for fun. As long as parents choose preschool 
programs in which their children have a Chance to play, then there's 
certainly no cause for concern. But if parents have chosen programs 
that are structured at school and their lives at home are structured, 
then it could be some cause for concern. The study says the importance 
of play shouldn't be underestimated, as it helps kids develop social 
and mental skills.
