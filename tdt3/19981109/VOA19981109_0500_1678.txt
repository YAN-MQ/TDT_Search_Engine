Well, we've got a story from China that is so much that isn't told 
than it is really the punchline on this story. They had a wild lion 
escaping from his pen at a Chinese animal park last month. How did 
the animal escape? He climbed out of a ladder that had been going 
over the walls into where he was kept. The Official Liberation Daily 
Newspaper reported Monday that keepers at this park were shocked to 
see the male lion just scale right over the wall. The keepers and 
police managed to surround the feline and tranquilize it with a dart 
gun before it devoured anybody. The ladder was left in the cat's den 
by a burglar who fed in terror when he realized his break-in had carried 
him into the lion's den. It's biblical reference, is it? About into 
the lion's den. Into the lion's den. Oh boy, yes. He probably though 
he was going to make off with something small and cuddly. Who know? 
What do you steal from an animal park anyway? Something small and 
cuddly, I don't know.
