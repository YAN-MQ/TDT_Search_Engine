This week we'll take "A closer look" at the progress or Perle, depending 
on the point of view, -- they have found a way to insert genes into 
the heart, which means that patients can grow new blood vessels and 
create their own heart bypass. There have been a similar medical experiment 
by scientists at tufts. It's another stunning example of what genetic 
engineering is capable of. There's a lot to cover this week about 
science and society. So we'll start with the basics. Here's ABC's 
Robert Krulwich on what is men the by Jen netic engineering. If go 
back 3 1/2 billion years, when the very first spec of life appeared 
on earth, that spec produced another spec and another and eventually 
-- us. All living creatures, bacteria, plants, animals, all of us, 
reproduce -- we make copies of ourselves. And the copying instructions 
are contained in genes, in chemicals called dna. Years ago, scientists 
discovered that since we are all descended from the same original 
creature, we're all cousins. No matter how they look on the outside, 
if you look at their DNA, they're all related. It's Baker's yeast. 
You and I, for example, share 20% to 30% of the genes in a yeast. 
That's right. A yeast. The one-celled creatures that we use to bake 
bread and to brew beer. They have genes, exactly like our genes. And 
they do for them what they do for us? And they do for them what they 
do for us. For example, here's a yeast doing what yeast love to do 
-- making more yeast. But suppose that this yeast got sick and couldn't 
multiply any more. Can we take a Gene out of me, put it into that 
yeast, and get it rolling again? That would be very easy for us to 
do. And by the same token, doctors have taken genes from yeast to 
fix problems in humans. At the DNA level, all creatures share potentially 
interchangeable parts. The more highly developed the creature, the 
more genes we share. If we share 20% with a yeast, it's more like 
80% with a chicken, 90% with a Cow, and when we get to monkeys, says 
Dr. Francis Collins, who runs the government's most ambitious Gene 
project, we get real close. The chimp, our sort of closest relative, 
99% of the chimp's DNA sequence is identical to ours. Identical? Identical. 
Since we are so closely related to our fellow animals and even to 
plants, more scientists are saying why not take the genes that they 
have and use them to help or heal ourselves? After all, we're family.
