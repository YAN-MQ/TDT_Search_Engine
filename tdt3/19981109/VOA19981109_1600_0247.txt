An opposition strike has crippled Bangladesh for a second day, and 
violence is reported in a key port city. VOA correspondent Douglas 
Bakshun reports from our South Asia bureau. Witnesses say there was 
violence in the southern port city of Chittagong where supporters 
and opponents of the strike clashed leaving dozens of people injured. 
Authorities say the sides fought with bombs, revolvers, and stones 
and police responded with tear gas and riot batons. But in the capital, 
Dhaka, things were more orderly. There was little traffic on the streets 
and extra security forces were on patrol. The opposition originally 
planned the strike for only Monday and Tuesday, but has extended the 
action until Wednesday. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party 
called the strike to protest police action at a Saturday rally during 
which authorities fired tear gas. accuses the government of political 
repression. The government denies this and says the opposition is 
trying to destabilize the country. Douglas Bakshun, VOA News, South 
Asia bureau.
