House speaker Newt Gingrich had the ear of most of his loyal supporters 
tonight. He spoke to a room full of gopac members in Washington, a 
political organization that helped him rise through the republican 
ranks. Many gopac members say they were surprised by Gingrich's announcement 
that he was leaving Congress but few said they were disappointed with 
him. Louisiana congressman Bob Livingston, the man who probably will 
replace gingrich, also was there. Gingrich called him the next speaker 
of the house. He also thanked gopac members, his constituents and 
other republicans for their support. It was a tremendous honor to 
become the first republican speaker since 1954. And it was, if anything, 
an even greater honor to be the first republican speaker to be re-elected 
since 1928. As speaker, I've had the privilege of leading the people's 
house, which I believe is the centerpiece of freedom on the entire 
planet.
