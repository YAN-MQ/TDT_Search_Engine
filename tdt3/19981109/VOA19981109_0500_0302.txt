International aide shipments are pouring into Central America as workers 
continue to sort through devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. The 
American Red Cross shipped enough food Sunday to feed 1000 families 
for a month in the Southern Honduran City of Tolicheca. Airplanes 
also began delivering water purification machines and other much needed 
equipment to the region. Former US President George Bush lost a home 
in hurricane. Our house was taken away. Everything that we have ever 
had in our life is gone. And I am still optimistic. I still have faith 
in God. I know things will get better. It's a powerful lesson, powerful 
Hurricane Mitch, Central America's strongest storm ever. I'm Bill 
Hazard, VOA News.
