The European Union said Monday it was taking its complaints against 
Argentina for alleged restrictions on leather trade to the World Trade 
Organization. In a statement, the European Commission said its investigations 
revealed Argentina had erected ``trade barriers which conflict with 
WTO rules.'' The EU executive body said these included an effective 
ban on the export of raw hides and discriminatory taxes on leather 
imports. Following fruitless bilateral talks with Argentina, the Commission 
said it had requested consultations at the Geneva-based WTO that should 
start mid-December. If the consultation procedure fails to find a 
solution, either part can request that the WTO set up a panel to rule 
on the dispute. The Commission took up the case after complaints from 
European producers.
