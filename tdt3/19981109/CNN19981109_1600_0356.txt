President Clinton is expected to be briefed on Iraq by national security 
adviser Sandy Berger today. He met with Berger and his top security 
advisers yesterday at camp David. A spokesman says the president reviewed 
the diplomatic and military options with them and "asked for a follow-up 
on both fronts." President Saddam Hussein has declared an end to Iraq's 
cooperation with the u.N. weapons inspectors. The state department 
says the international community is united in its outrage against 
Baghdad. A United Nations spokesman says arms inspectors in Iraq are 
ready to resume their activities.
