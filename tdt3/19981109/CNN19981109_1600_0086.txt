Newt Gingrich isn't talking about his future. Gingrich returned to 
the capitol today for the first time since he announced he's stepping 
down as house speaker and resigning from Congress. He was greeted 
by dozens of cheering tourists who gave him a warm ovation. Meanwhile, 
the question over who will succeed him as house speaker has apparently 
been answered. Louisiana republican Bob Livingston is the only candidate 
left after christopher Cox, his chief rival for the post, threw in 
the towel today. Cox says he is confident Livingston will do a good 
job as house speaker. Bob Livingston may not be a household name to 
people outside his Louisiana district. Charles Zewe takes a closer 
look at his career. Would-be house speaker Bob Livingston Sunday, 
trying to shake hands with striking ABC workers in Washington. You 
can't settle disputes unless they shake your hand. People who know 
him say this is typical of the 55-year-old republican. For 20 years, 
the lanky congressman has represented Louisiana's 85% white first 
district in suburban New Orleans. He's a descendant of the man who 
gave George Washington the oath of office, but he's not rich. Bob 
Livingston's first job as a 14-year-old was here at this zoo in New 
Orleans where he shoveled Dung at the elephant house. A Tulane law 
grad, Livingston was a federal prosecutor before being elected a house 
member in 1977. He ran unsuccessfully for Louisiana governor ten years 
later. Then in 1994, Newt Gingrich plucked him from relative obscurity 
to be appropriations committee chairman. He's fought to strip controversial 
legislation out of money bills, but help deliver millions to build 
new Navy sea-lift vessels at the Louisiana shipyard where he worked 
as a young man. On the floor, he often delivers speeches that begin 
softly and build. We will stay here 'til doomsday, defeat this motion 
to recommit. After this display, his mom told him not to do that anymore. 
Ironically, Livingston wanted to quit Congress nine months ago. I 
have changed my mind. New Orleans civic leaders, including a popular 
Catholic Bishop, talked him out of it. Now, Gingrich, the man who 
pulled him to power, is leaving. And Livingston, perhaps about to 
be only two heartbeats from the presidency, is facing a much bigger 
cleanup job for his party, some say, than his old days at the elephant 
house. Charles Zewe, CNN, New Orleans.
