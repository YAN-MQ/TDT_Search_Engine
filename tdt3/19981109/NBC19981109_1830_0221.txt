Well before he became speaker, Gingrich was well-known in national 
politics -- The conservative commando with the strategy of taking 
control of the house, reforming welfare, reducing the role of government, 
trying a variety of new approaches to old problems. He did change 
a lot of the old rules, but in the end, his friends got him, including 
the man who will succeed him, Bob Livingston -- as little-known as 
Gingrich is famous. NBC's Lisa Myers on "the man who would be speaker." 
The 55-year-old speaker to be says he's not a revolutionary or a Big 
thinker, but a manager intent on turning republican ideas into law. 
That sounds boring. But, boring, Livingston is not. The 6'5" former 
prosecutor has a black belt in karate, plays the harmonica, and has 
a flair for drama. He had this to say during the 1995 government shutdown. 
As Winston Churchill says, "we will never, never, never give in. We 
will stay here till doomsday, defeat this contentious motion to recommit, 
and pass this continuing resolution, and merry Christmas." Livingston 
vows never to do that again. He says his mother said he looked like 
a lunatic. In Washington, the word everyone uses to describe him is 
"tough." Bob Livingston is a tough Louisiana politician with everything 
that that means. When the fight starts, you desperately want to make 
sure he is on your side. Livingston is a man of modest means. He began 
working when he was 16. During 21 years in Congress, he has been a 
pragmatic conservative -- pro-defense, for tax cuts, against abortion, 
who can work with democrats. I think this place will be less of a 
snake pit that it has been for the last four years. He practicing 
pork barrel politics. He doesn't back stab. He tells people off to 
their face. He can be hot with you one minute, but when it's over, 
Bob Livingston is a Reconciler. Republicans hope that Livingston's 
imposing presence and dealmaking skills will produce results. But, 
for now, his greatest selling point is that he's not Newt Gingrich.
