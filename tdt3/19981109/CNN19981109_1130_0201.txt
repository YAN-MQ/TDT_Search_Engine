With no challengers, it appears representative Bob Livingston may 
become the next speaker of the house. Charles Zewe takes a closer 
look at this Louisiana republican. Would-be house speaker Bob Livingston 
Sunday, trying to shake hands with striking ABC workers in Washington. 
You can't settle disputes unless they shake your hand. People who 
know him say this is typical of the 55-year-old republican. For 20 
years, the lanky congressman has represented Louisiana's 85% white, 
first district in suburban New Orleans. He's a descendant of the man 
who gave George Washington the oath of office, but he's not rich. 
His first job was at the zoo where he shoveled Dung. A Tulane law 
grad, Livingston was a federal prosecutor before being elected a house 
member in 1977. He ran unsuccessfully for Louisiana governor ten years 
later. Then in 1994, Newt Gingrich plucked him from relative obscurity 
to be appropriations committee chairman. He's fought to strip controversial 
legislation out of money bills, but help deliver millions to build 
new Navy sealift vessels at the Louisiana shipyard where he worked 
as a young man. On the floor, he often delivers speeches that begin 
softly, and build. We will stay here 'til doomsday, defeat this motion 
to recommit. After this display, his mom told him not to do that anymore. 
Ironically, Livingston wanted to quit Congress nine months ago. I 
have changed my mind. New Orleans civic leaders, including a popular 
Catholic Bishop, talked him out of it. Now, Gingrich, the man who 
pulled him to power, is leaving and Livingston, perhaps about to be 
two heartbeats from the presidency, is facing a much bigger cleanup 
job for his party, some say, than his old days at the elephant house.
