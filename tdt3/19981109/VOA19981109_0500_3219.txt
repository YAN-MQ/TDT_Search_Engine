Are ready for Whitney Houston. I would just love to give you a listen 
to the new Whitney Houston CD "My Love Is Your Love", but her record 
company is trying hard to keep it all a secret until the November 
17th release date. All we can tell you right now is that Babyface 
produced a few of the tracks on "My Love Is Your Love" and one is 
a duet with Mariah Carrey. This is will be Whitney Houston's of just 
music in eight years. Her last couple of releases were all movie soundtracks.
