In Major League Baseball, Chicago Cubs Carrie Wood is the National 
League's Rookie of the Year. The right-hander tied a Major League 
record with 20 strike outs in just his fifth start this past season. 
Wood edged Colorado Rockies' first baseman Todd Helton in the annual 
balloting by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Wood says 
it's a great honor. pass, it's you know - I'm glad to be a part of 
that group. It's a great honor and, you know, the guys have won this 
award in the past, and they're great players, and they've had great 
careers. And, you know, hopefully I can continue my career and have 
a good one. Wood finished the year with a 13 and six record before 
a sprained right elbow ended his season August 31st. The American 
League will name its Rookie of the Year Award winner later today.
