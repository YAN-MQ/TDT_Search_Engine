Islamic scholars Monday defended their religion's human-rights record 
before a special United Nations forum aimed at improving respect for 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. ``There are still some 
circles in the West, acting out of their own vested interests, who 
still persist on perpetuating fears and arousing suspicion about Islam,'' 
said Kamel Al-Sharif of Jordan, secretary-general of an Islamic relief 
organization. Critics of the religion have been organizing anti-Islamic 
campaigns which portrayed a false image of the religion, al-Sharif 
said. ``It is not strange for the Arabs and Muslims to support the 
International Declaration of Human Rights because they can find in 
it a collection of supreme humanitarian principles which are compatible 
with their faith and traditions,'' he said. Al-Sharif was one of 20 
authorities on Islamic law invited to speak at the two-day event, 
organized by Mary Robinson, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, 
at the suggestion of Iran. In her keynote speech, Mrs. Robinson said 
Islam, which is the religion of a fifth of the people on the planet, 
had ``the dignity of the human person, tolerance and equity at the 
core of its message.'' Apart from Mrs. Robinson, all the speakers 
were Muslims. Human-rights organizations have complained that they 
are barred from asking questions or commenting at the seminar. Ahmad 
Kamal Abdoumagd, professor of public law at the University of Cairo, 
told the seminar that no country entirely lived up to what was stated 
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now in its 50th anniversary 
year. ``This is nothing particular to Islam. It is everywhere,'' said 
Abdoumagd. ``Else how can we understand that in a highly developed 
country like the United States racial discrimination and other forms 
of discrimination continue to survive?'' Abdoumagd also attacked Muslims 
and non-Muslims who called for the rejection of the Islamic Shariah 
legal code as the only way to ensure human rights, saying the suggestion 
lacked ``cultural legitimacy.'' ``No Muslim would accept a solution 
that doesn't stem internally from his culture,' he said. The idea 
for the seminar was born when Mrs. Robinson visited Iran in February. 
The Iranians suggested a scholarly event to try to bring together 
Islamic culture and the rights declaration. Human rights organizations 
have accused Iran and some other countries in the Muslim world of 
systematic abuses that include extrajudicial killings, torture and 
harsh prison conditions. The event has been put together in conjunction 
with the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which has 52 member 
countries. ``We are hoping it will be the start of a process,'' said 
human rights official John Pace. ``The purpose is to remove or help 
to remove certain levels of ignorance of values and customs.''
