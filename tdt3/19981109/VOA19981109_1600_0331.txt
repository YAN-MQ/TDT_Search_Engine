Republican Congressman Bob Livingston of Louisiana is poised to become 
the next speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. His only rival, 
Congressman Chris Cox of California, has dropped out of the race. 
The competition for the speaker's job got underway last week when 
Newt Gingrich announced his resignation from the post following Republican 
losses in the November 3rd election. Congressional Republicans are 
to choose their new leaders this month.
