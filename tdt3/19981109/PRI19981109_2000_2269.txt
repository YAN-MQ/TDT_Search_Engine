For today's Africa quiz, oops I almost gave it away-geography quiz 
we're headed to Africa. We're looking for the northern most province 
of South Africa where big cats, elephants, giraffes, roam free in 
the huge Cougar National Park. The topography varies from the plains 
bordering Mozambique on the east up through the hills and the forests 
of the Dracenburg Mountains to the High Belter Plateau in the west. 
Tourist flock to see the big game, but it's the little things in life 
that excite the local Venda people of our mystery province. They travel 
far and wide in search of particular protein rich delicacy. It's found 
on trees. It's not fruit. Skew it over and we'll be back with the 
answer to today's geography quiz in a little while.
