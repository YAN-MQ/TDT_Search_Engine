Warnings against a resurgent anti-Semitism colored ceremonies Monday 
marking the 60th anniversary of Kristallnacht _ or ``Night of Broken 
Glass'' _ when the Holocaust began with Nazi storm troopers burning 
and ransacking Jewish businesses and synagogues. Ignatz Bubis, the 
leader of Germany's Jews, noted with alarm that ideas once considered 
extremist have become mainstream, pointing to a German author who 
says it is time to look away from Nazi atrocities. Such ``intellectual 
nationalism'' gives comfort to neo-Nazis, Bubis told an audience of 
about 2,000 gathered in a Berlin synagogue. The commemoration of Kristallnacht, 
when more than 1,300 synagogues were destroyed, has special significance 
this year as a new generation of leaders with no personal recollection 
of the Holocaust take office. Led by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, 
54, the government returns next year to Germany's prewar capital, 
Berlin, seat of Hitler's dictatorship and the earlier Prussian military 
state. Remarks by Bubis and others reflected concerns that the government's 
move and the generational change underscore a desire to return to 
``normality'' _ for some a Germany unburdened by guilt for the Holocaust 
_ by overlooking the past. Schroeder attended Monday's ceremony, where 
speakers included German President Roman Herzog and Israel's chief 
rabbi, Meir Lau, who recalled his imprisonment as a child in the Nazi 
concentration camp Buchenwald. Punctuating concerns about a resurgence 
of anti-Semitism, tiny swastikas were found Monday scratched on a 
Star of David memorial in Berlin commemorating the mass deportation 
of the city's Jews to concentration camps.
