Hello again, from Washington I'm Charlene Porter along with Kurt Hanshen. 
Several United Nations arms inspectors are set to leave Iraq today 
as Baghdad continues to defy a UN resolution demanding that it allow 
inspectors to resume work. UN officials say a total of 15 inspectors 
are expected to leave by Wednesday. About 100 will remained poised 
to resume their search for banned weapons. Sunday, Iraq signaled no 
change in its refusal to allow more inspections before a definite 
timetable is set up for lifting the UN sanctions. Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq Aziz called on the United Nations to lift its ban on the sale 
of Iraqi oil as a step toward lifting all sanctions.
