Armed men staged a hit-and-run attack on a Canadian-owned diamond 
mine in Angola, killing at least five employees and taking four others 
hostage, the company reported Monday. DiamondWorks Ltd. said the attack 
occurred early Sunday at its Yetwene mine in northeastern Angola. 
``Preliminary reports indicate that, despite resistance by the company's 
security contractors, five of the company's operating personnel were 
killed by the assailants,'' the Vancouver-based company said. ``Four 
expatriate company personnel are reportedly being held captive by 
the attackers and a further two remain unaccounted for.'' It said 
18 Angolan workers were wounded in the attack. The remaining 13 foreign 
workers were unharmed and have been flown to Angola's capital, Luanda, 
DiamondWorks said. The identities of the slain and missing workers, 
including their nationality, were not disclosed. The identities of 
the attackers have not been confirmed. Initial reports from the mine 
indicate that there was some theft and minor damage to vehicles and 
communication systems. However, the company said mining equipment 
and the diamond processing plant were not damaged and the diamond 
inventory was safe. Officials said it was not possible to say when 
production will resume. The Yetwene mine has been producing between 
5,000 and 6,000 carats a month, about 50 percent the company's total 
diamond production.
