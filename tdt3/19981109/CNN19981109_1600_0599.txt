Central American communities that were spared by hurricane Mitch are 
still feeling the storm's impact. As Pat Neal reports, the spread 
of disease could deepen the crisis. Something precious arrived in 
this village near Comayagua, honduras. This is good because we haven't 
been able to get water for days. Villagers were spared from serious 
damage that devastated their country. But debris and dead bodies contaminated 
the river water. They told us not to drink it. So for three days, 
U.S. soldiers from the nearby Soto cano base rolled in a tanker, and 
the water started flowing. A total of 15,000 gallons of water. But 
the U.S. military is supported by some rapid deployment delivery forces. 
"Tito, hurry up," shouts 5-year-old dondi, as the two boys Ferry bucket 
after bucket to residents. There's been a crisis in the village because 
we don't have any water. Vilma Ramos lives here with her three young 
children. So neighbors dondi and Tito gladly help out. Some people 
are sick, and then they can't carry the containers and then they can't 
get anything to drink. The line grows longer. But the people of this 
community are patient. They say they are fortunate. They have their 
homes, and now, fresh water. Some other communities don't even have 
buckets. Many children make the trip from blocks away. 7-year-old 
Pamela and her pet parrot paquita wait their turn. This is the second 
time this morning she's refilled the bucket. About once a month the 
U.S. military had been delivering water to this town as part of an 
exercise to check equipment. Now these soldiers are visiting many 
towns wherever the Honduran government says they're needed. And Tito 
and dondi say they're ready for action, whenever the military returns 
and the villagers need water again. Pat Neal, CNN, near Comayagua, 
Honduras.
