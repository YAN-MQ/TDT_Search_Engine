Indonesia military says three of its soldiers have been killed during 
a clash in the troubled territory of East Timor. Military officials 
say one civilian was also killed when a mob attacked a military outpost 
on Monday. Last week, officials accused East Timor's activists of 
murdering two soldiers, a policeman, and a government employee. The 
violence comes as East Timor prepares to mark the seventh anniversary 
of the Deley massacre when Indonesian troops fired at a funeral procession.
