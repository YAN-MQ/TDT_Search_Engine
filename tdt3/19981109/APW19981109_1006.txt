Norway on Monday asked Turkey to reverse a travel ban for leading 
human rights activist Akin Birdal and allow him to come to this northern 
country for medical treatment and meetings. Birdal, who recently survived 
an assassination attempt, last month was sentenced in Turkey to one 
year in prison for inciting racial hatred in a speech two years ago. 
He had called for a peaceful solution to end a war between autonomy-seeking 
Kurds and government troops in southeastern Turkey. It was not clear 
when Birdal was to begin serving his sentence, and Norway had invited 
him to Oslo for physical therapy for the gunshot wounds he suffered 
in the assassination attempt. He was also to have met Norwegian leaders, 
and hold a lecture at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, the headquarters 
of the Nobel Peace Prize. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard 
Havnen said Birdal had been denied permission to leave Turkey on Monday. 
``We have expressed strong concern and have encouraged the Turkish 
authorities to reverse that decision,'' Havnen said by telephone. 
Birdal is a prominent campaigner against torture and the army's forced 
evacuation of Kurdish villages in southeastern Turkey. He is head 
of the country's Human Rights Association.
