Central American leaders are meeting today to discuss how to handle 
the devastation caused by hurricane Mitch. They're expected to ask 
world financial organizations to forgive their international debts. 
French officials are suggesting the central American countries be 
offered a Moratorium on the debt payments. An estimated 10,000 people 
lost their lives in the storm and its aftermath. So far, the United 
States has committed $70 million in aid, the first of which was distributed 
by U.S. soldiers over the weekend. You're going to have to rebuild 
20 years of infrastructure, replacing those roads and bridges. That 
is going to obviously take a sustained effort. President Clinton has 
made a $70 million commitment to start that process and has called 
on other countries to also contribute to that effort. And you're seeing 
a multination effort in this initial phase of recovery. But it's going 
to take a very strong commitment over the next few years. Former president 
bush got a first-hand look at Mitch's devastation yesterday. He toured 
parts of Honduras and met with President Carlos flores. Bush says 
he'll push for a continued relief effort in central America.
