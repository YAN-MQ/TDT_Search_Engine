Mexico's ruling party appears headed for a strong showing in four 
state elections held Sunday. Analysts say the voting could serve to 
predict the outcome of which way the voters will go in the presidential 
elections in 2000. The initial results show that the institutional 
revolutionary party, the PRI, holds a double digit lead in two governor's 
races in Central Pueblo State and Sanola on the Pacific seaboard. 
Initial results show the institutional revolutionary party is running 
even with the Democratic revolution party in a third gubernatorial 
race in the smallest state in Mexico. The ruling PRI has already won 
five of seven gubernatorial elections this year.
