I'm Bill Hazard, VOA News. Several UN arms inspectors are set to leave 
Iraq today as Bahgdad continues to defy a UN resolution demanding 
to allow inspectors to resume work. UN officials say 15 inspectors 
are set to leave by Wednesday, about 100 will ramin poised to resume 
work. But Sunday, Iraq signaled no change in its refusal to allow 
more inspections before a timetable is set up for lifting UN sanctions. 
Meanwhile, President Clinton met with top security advisors and ordered 
more study on diplomatic and military options for dealing with Iraq.
