Thousands of followers of the founding father of Bangladesh danced 
in the street of Dacus Sunday in reaction to the decision by a judge 
giving 15 people convicted of his murder the death sentence. Shak 
Maflan was murdered during a military coup 23 years ago. Agina Papsucha 
reports. Judge Kasi Guanareslu said the 15 army officers are guilty 
of direct involvement in the deaths of Mr. Maflan and most of his 
family in a 1975 army coup. The officers have been sentenced to death 
by firing squad. Lawyers say the convicted officers will appeal the 
sentence in a higher court. Four other accused including a former 
minister have been acquitted of charges of killing Mr. Maflan who 
is known as the founding father of Bangladesh. Mr. Maflan was gunned 
down by rebellious soldiers at his Daka residence four years after 
leading his country to independence from Pakistan in 1991. Thousands 
of Mr. Maflan followers danced in the streets outside the courtroom 
as the verdict was handed down. The trial of the army officers began 
in July last year, 22 years after the 1975 killings. It was order 
after the assassinated leaders daughter Shak Kasina became prime minister. 
A previous government had passed laws to bar the trial of Mr. Maflan's 
assassins. Shak Kasina's government changed those laws clearing the 
way for a civil court to try officers taking part in an army coup 
for the first time. Political power has been captured through violence 
in several occasions in Bangledash's 27 year history. The nation's 
turbulent politics have included the assassination of two heads of 
government and several military coups. Sunday's verdict is expected 
to cause more political turbulence as it increases the bitterness 
between the countries to main political parties. Shak Kasina's Armania 
League Party accuses the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party of 
protecting those involved in the 1975 coup. The opposition denies 
those charges. Agina Papsucha for VOA News, New Delhi.
