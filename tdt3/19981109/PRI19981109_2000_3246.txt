He's young, hip, and mysterious. Not to mention, the hottest thing 
to hit Sweden and Norway. Got that. He's Dr. Bombay. And just like 
Dr. Bombay in "Bewitched", it's not clear just where he's from. He 
might be a taxi driver from Copenhagen, born to an Indian mother and 
a Danish father. That's what his Web site says. But, even mysterious 
forces who like the Web page, well, they don't know for sure. But 
this we do know, Dr. Bombay's standard apparel consists of dark brown 
glasses, a bushy goatee, and something that looks like a Hollywood 
version of an Indian costume. Whatever he is, whoever he is, Dr. Bombay's 
latest CD "Rice and Curry" is dominating the charts in Scandinavia 
where folks seem to have no trouble relating to the taxi driving experiences 
he brings to his music. Here's Dr. Bombay's chart-topping single "Calcutta, 
Taxi, Taxi, Taxi". That's Dr. Bombay with "Calcutta, Taxi, Taxi, Taxi" 
ending our show today. In Boston, our team includes Connie Glazer, 
Patrick Cox, Katharine Griffin, Valerie Gunderson, Anu Pala, Steven
