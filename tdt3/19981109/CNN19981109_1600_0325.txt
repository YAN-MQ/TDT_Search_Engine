Attorney general Janet Reno announced new efforts today to crackdown 
on violence at clinics where abortions are performed. The newly formed 
task force will investigate violence against clinics and workers, 
as well as identify future security risks and develop ways to make 
those clinics safer. The initiative follows incidents at several clinics 
around the nation. Reno announced a $500,000 reward for information 
leading to an arrest and conviction in the death of Dr. Barnett slepian, 
who was killed in his New York home last month.
