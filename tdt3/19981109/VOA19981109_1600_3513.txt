It is time now for many of our affiliates to take a short break. This 
is VOA News Now. Today is Tuesday, November 10th. On this date in 
1775, the Continental Congress established the United States Marine 
Corps. The founding resolution said the new fighting force was to 
work on Navy ships as boarding parties and sharp shooters. The resolution 
also mandated that marines act in the role of enforcers of ship board 
discipline and have the skills of sailors. The Marines' first combat 
came in March of 1776 in a successful raid against new providence 
in British Bahama Islands. Since then, the Marines have fought in 
virtually every war and military action in which the United States 
has participated. And on November the 11th, 1962, the United Nations 
Secretary General Utad eulogized Eleanor Roosevelt as the first lady 
of the world. The secretary general was speaking at the funeral of 
Mrs. Roosevelt. She was the widow of Franklin Roosevelt, who served 
12 years as president of the United States. During those years, Eleanor 
Roosevelt expanded, some say even revolutionized, the role of the 
political wife. She turned the office of the first lady, which until 
had no official standing or duties, into a base for independent political 
action. Eleanor Roosevelt spoke out on issues that she personally 
considered important, issues such as civil rights for black Americans, 
full equality for women, and liberation of the world's subjected people. 
She followed her public statements with informal efforts to encourage 
governments to take official action. After World War II, she was selected 
as the United Nations Special Commission that wrote the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. I'm Steve Norman along with Frank Wydis.
