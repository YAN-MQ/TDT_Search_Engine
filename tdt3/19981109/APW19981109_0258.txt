Government negotiators will meet Muslim rebels to try to resolve an 
impasse over their demand that the government recognize certain areas 
in the southern Philippines as rebel-held territories, an official 
said Monday. In talks last week, the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation 
Front demanded the immediate recognition of at least 46 MILF camps 
as rebel territories to prevent accidental military encounters. The 
government negotiators refused to immediately recognize the rebel 
camps and the MILF threatened to stop peace negotiations with the 
government until the demand is granted. Presidential spokesman Jerry 
Barican said the government will verify whether the MILF camps exist 
and if rebels are occupying them, and then schedule a meeting with 
MILF leaders. He said the two sides also would try to have a common 
definition of ``rebel camps.'' Philippine officials have said that 
any such recognition should adhere to the constitution. Al Haj Murad, 
the MILF's vice chairman for military affairs, said officials should 
not impose any conditions because the government has already agreed 
in principle to grant such recognition under a cease-fire accord signed 
last year. He said the recognition would not signify rebel ownership, 
but control of the lands. MILF's ownership of the lands could be discussed 
when peace negotiations reach the ``formal, substantive stage,'' Murad 
said. The MILF is now the largest Muslim rebel group waging a war 
to establish a separate Islamic state in the southern Philippines. 
The government signed a peace accord in 1996 with the Moro National 
Liberation Front, and then opened peace negotiations with the MILF, 
which controls large hinterland areas in Mindanao. Murad said the 
MILF has 13 major and 33 small camps in Mindanao. Its headquarters, 
Camp Abubakar, is in Maguindanao, about 880 kilometers (550 miles) 
southeast of Manila.
