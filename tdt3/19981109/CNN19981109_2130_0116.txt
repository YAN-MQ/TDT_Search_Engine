Bob Livingston, who chairs the house appropriations committee, appears 
well-positioned to replace Gingrich. His only declared opponent, Christopher 
Cox from California, dropped out of the race today and threw his support 
behind Livingston. With Bob Livingston as speaker, we're going to 
get something we haven't had before -- a legislative craftsman at 
the helm. And that's something we need right now. Because getting 
legislation through gridlock, through tough fights with democrats 
and republicans, almost parity, is what's going to make the difference.
