Ethiopia said Monday it has accepted an 11-point OAU proposal to break 
the impasse in the Ethiopia-Eritrea border conflict, but Eritrea said 
no real progress had been made at a weekend summit in Burkina Faso. 
Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said Ethiopia had accepted the proposal 
that calls on Eritrea to deploy its troops outside two contested border 
areas. Both Ethiopian Premier Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President 
Isaias Afwerki _ former comrades in arms in the fight to oust the 
dictatorship of Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam _ attended 
the summit convened in Ouagadougou by the current chairman of the 
Organization of African Unity, Burkina President Blaise Campaore. 
The presidents of Zimbabwe and Djibouti, Robert Mugabe and Hassan 
Gouled Aptidon, served as mediators with Campaore. ``We were hoping 
the OAU would come out with something realistic, but unfortunately 
it was a non-starter,'' Eritrean presidential adviser Yemane Gebremeskel 
told reporters in the Eritrean capital, Asmara. Seyoum said Ethiopia 
had accepted the key proposal on troop redeployment after clarification 
from the OAU triumvirate that it was calling on Eritrea to withdraw 
to positions it held before May 12 when Ethiopian militia shot Eritrean 
soldiers they claimed had occupied Ethiopian territory. Yemane said 
Ethiopia's demand _ now apparently the OAU's as well _ that Eritrea 
unilaterally withdraw from the contested Badme and Shiraro areas remains 
the main stumbling block to a peaceful solution. Eritrea wants an 
international monitoring force in place before any troop withdrawal 
takes place. Eritrea had earlier called for direct talks between Isaias 
and Meles but has recently backed away from that position. ``We are 
interested in substantive results, whether direct or indirect,'' Yemane 
said. The OAU gave Eritrea until the end of December to respond officially 
to the proposals. Yemane said Eritrea had hoped that the summit would 
at least come up with an explicit agreement on the cessation of hostilities. 
Serious fighting broke out in early June with hundreds of deaths on 
both sides. Since then a de facto cease-fire has been in effect, although 
there have been sporadic artillery exchanges at the front lines. Anthony 
Lake, U.S. President Bill Clinton's envoy to the Horn of Africa, was 
expected back Addis Ababa Wednesday and was to travel to Asmara Thursday. 
It was not clear whether Lake, who was in the region last month, had 
anything new to propose. The United States and Rwanda issued a peace 
initiative shortly after the June fighting that closely reassembles 
the OAU's 11-point proposal.
