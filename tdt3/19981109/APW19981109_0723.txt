The head of soccer's governing body has again called it a mistake 
to give the 2002 World Cup jointly to Japan and South Korea. ``It 
is not something that should be repeated,'' Sepp Blatter, the head 
of FIFA, told the daily Le Figaro in an interview published Monday. 
``Ask the Belgians and the Dutch if they are happy to organize jointly 
the coming Euro (European championships). If they are honest, they 
will say no. Not together.'' ``After the opening match, who gets the 
final? And also, there is a real tradition of antipathy between Korea 
and Japan,'' Blatter was quoted as saying. Blatter, who took over 
this year from Joao Havelange, also repeated his backing for holding 
the 2006 World Cup in Africa. Last month, Blatter dealt a blow to 
England's hopes of hosting the 2006 tournament when he told Prime 
Minister Tony Blair that Africa was the logical choice for soccer's 
showcase. ``That continent has the right to organize the World Cup 
because of all it has offered soccer,'' he told Le Figaro. Bidding 
opens this month and England, South Africa and Germany are regarded 
as the main contenders. The winner will be announced in March 2000 
after a vote by a 24-member FIFA committee.
