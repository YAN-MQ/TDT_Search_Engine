Postponement of the Confederations Cup, scheduled for January, is 
being considered and could persuade world champion France to take 
part, a FIFA spokesman said Monday. France last month pulled out of 
the event after many European clubs and domestic leagues made it clear 
they didn't want to release their French players for the event, which 
comes in the middle of league seasons. ``There is a consensus among 
the participants that postponement would be possible'' and that consequently 
``French participation would be possible,'' FIFA spokesman Andreas 
Herren said. A final decision on dates for the tournament will be 
made Nov. 17, Herren said. If the tournament is postponed, it will 
likely take place in late July or early August, he added. Some regard 
the event as an unneeded one that exhausts already burned out players. 
``Les Bleus'' were scheduled to represent Europe in the competition, 
along with teams from Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, the United States, 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Australia. Roger Lemerre, the new coach of 
the French team, had been in favor of the French team's participation, 
which would have allowed him to test out new players.
