Former US President George Bush has called for more aide to strom-battered 
Central American during a one day unofficial visit to Honduras. The 
former president also warned of a possible wave of immigrants from 
the region into Mexico and the United States. He said the destruction 
in Honduras could lead people to find anyway to cross boarders. The 
first shipments of $20 million in food aide from the US Agency For 
International Development have begun arriving in Honduras. Honduran 
President Carlos Florez had previously complained that the United 
States was not as forthcoming with aide as other countries. The Washington 
Post quotes President Florez as telling reports that President Clinton 
called him Saturday and reassured him about US releif efforts.
