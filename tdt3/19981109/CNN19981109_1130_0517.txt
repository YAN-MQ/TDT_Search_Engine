Meteorologists may soon have a new system to describe the severity 
of winter storms. A one-to-five scale similar to the ones used to 
rate hurricanes and tornadoes is being tested this year in Nebraska 
and Wyoming. A storm that rates a one on the scale is classified as 
a minor inconvenience. A category five storm is life-threatening. 
The weather service will review the system's performance this spring.
