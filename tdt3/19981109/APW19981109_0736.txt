A visiting Irish politician said Monday he believes Iraq is willing 
to compromise to head off threatened military action over suspended 
U.N. weapons inspections, but Britain's defense secretary said time 
was running out. Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting cooperation 
with international inspectors until the Security Council begins moving 
to lift the sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait. The devastating sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and 
other financial dealings, can only be lifted once inspectors certify 
that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction. Former Irish 
Prime Minister Albert Reynolds appealed to the United States and Britain 
to abandon threats of a military strike and to negotiate a settlement. 
``We believe that with good will on both sides, that a compromise 
could be worked out,'' he said. Reynolds, a member of the Irish Parliament, 
was credited with encouraging the Irish Republic Army's 1994 cease-fire. 
He planned to leave Iraq later Monday and said he would travel to 
the United States on Thursday to confer with American politicians. 
But Britain's Defense Secretary George Robertson on a visit to Kuwait 
said the world's patience with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is ``draining 
away.'' A diplomatic solution to resolve the crisis is ``still possible'' 
but the ``option of force is there, is real,'' Robertson told reporters 
in Kuwait where Britain has stationed 12 Tornado bombers. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton met Sunday with top security advisers, but put off a 
decision on whether to use force against Iraq to reopen military sites 
to U.N. inspectors. Reynolds said he met with Iraq's deputy prime 
minister, Tariq Aziz, for more than two hours on Sunday. He described 
Aziz as ``open'' and ``very flexible.'' Reynolds said: ``Today I would 
like to send a very clear message and a clear call to the United Nations, 
to President Clinton and to (British) Prime Minister Tony Blair that 
whatever (their feelings) about the conflict, that everybody gets 
around the table to dialogue and debate and talk to remove the sanctions.'' 
He suggested that the United Nations lift sanctions on medicine to 
let supplies into Iraq. Reynolds suggested that the United Nations 
lift restrictions on the import of medicine to allow a free flow of 
pharmaceutical supplies into Iraq. U.N. sanctions do not bar the import 
of medicines to Iraq, but a U.N. committee carefully screens all imports 
to Iraq. Baghdad repeatedly has claimed that the screening has led 
to serious delays.
