U.S. Justice Department officials questioned President Clinton on 
Monday in their probe of the Democratic Party's campaign financing 
practices. The president's lawyers say Mr. Clinton agreed to the interview 
voluntarily and is cooperating fully with investigators. They also 
say the 90 minutes went fine and that he was not under oath. The questioning 
was part of a preliminary investigation into whether the Democrats 
misused money allocated for political advertising during the 1996 
elections.
