Women who say their Dow corning silicone-gel breast implants caused 
health problems may soon begin receiving some money. A $3.2 billion 
settlement was filed in federal bankruptcy court today. 140,000 women 
have filed suit against Dow corning. Under the proposal, each would 
receive $2,000 to $300,000. A judge, the plaintiffs and a group of 
creditors must approve the deal. If they do, the women could start 
getting the money by next summer.
