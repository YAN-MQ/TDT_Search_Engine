This look at your "CNN Headline News Weather" begins with our forecast 
weather map for Tuesday morning. A big storm is rolling out of the 
Rockies. And the across the plains states to the north, near-blizzard 
conditions expected. Heavy snowfall, anywhere from four to eight inches, 
maybe more than that, accompanied by winds of over 35 miles an hour. 
As we put this map in motion, the cold front moves through the Mississippi 
river valley and in to the east. And all along that front, there is 
the threat of severe weather -- thunderstorms, even the possibility 
of tornadoes. Meanwhile, by tomorrow night, another weather system 
moves into the northwestern corner of the United States. It will be 
cold behind this storm with daytime highs only in the 30s, but much 
of the east will begin to warm a bit. We take a look at your extended 
forecast. You can see the storm moving in to the east as we head on 
into Wednesday. As we move on into Thursday, rain and snow continue 
in the Great Lakes area. And in the northwest, rainfall is expected. 
Moving on into Friday, you can see a large portion of the east, could 
see rain or thunderstorms, but there's not a high probability in this 
area that we have shaded green. For more weather information, log 
on to CNN.com.
