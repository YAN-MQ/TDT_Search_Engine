Iraq says it may review all United Nations resolutions it signed because 
sanctions have not been lifted. The comment comes as a second group 
of UN weapons inspectors pulled out of Baghdad after their work was 
halted by Saddam Hussein. The BBC's Richard Downs reports. The obstacle 
is yet another indication of the hard line Iraq is adopting in the 
face of pressure from the UN Security Counsel and the United States 
in particular. Iraqi officials continue to point out that their decision 
to break off all relations with the UNSCOM weapons inspectors is not 
irreversible. But, they also insist that they must at least be the 
prospect of an end to the economic embargo before they can change 
course. There's no sign of that at the moment and UNSCOM mission here 
is being scaled down further. Richard Downs, BBC News, Baghdad.
