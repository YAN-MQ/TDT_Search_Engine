The big question for U.S. stocks is whether the U.S. Central Bank 
will cut interest rates next week at its November 17th meeting. Analysts 
say the sharp rise in stock prices last week may have given the Central 
Bank enough of an indication the U.S. economy is doing well enough 
to forego a rate cut. Kevin Lane, the chief market strategist for 
Parker Financial Corporation says whether interest rates are cut again 
won't matter much to the market. I think it's, you know, hard to guess 
what Mr. Greenspan's going to do but, you know, it's anyone's guess. 
The market has stabilized and maybe that would be a reason for him 
not to cut back on the rates. But either way, I think the market looks 
strong either way. Parker Financial's Kevin Lane told Lumbourg News 
a rate cut has already been factored into the market. The fed cut 
interest rates September 29th and again on October 15th to keep the 
U.S. economy growing. But some analysts say stocks are overvalued 
and will fall if the fed chooses not to further cut interest rates.
