A state security court on Monday found eight university students guilty 
of membership in an illegal leftist group and sentenced them to prison 
terms ranging from five to eight years. Another student received a 
10-month prison sentence for making propaganda on behalf of the banned 
group, Revolutionary Youth, while three others were acquitted. In 
1996, the students, their ages then ranging from 20 to 25, were arrested 
for unfurling banners in parliament. Police said they found firebombs 
in eight of the students homes shortly after their arrests. The students 
accused police of planting them there. The case was being observed 
by human rights groups. The defendants were originally sentenced to 
between three and 18 years in prison on charges of terrorism. But 
an appeals court ordered a new trial in March asking for more evidence 
to prove that Revolutionary Youth was a terrorist group. ``We do not 
believe that the students received a trial by a fair and independent 
court,'' said Ender Buyukculha, a lawyer for the students. ``We are 
going to appeal.'' Some human rights groups have accused the security 
courts, which hear cases deemed to concern national security, of being 
on the side of prosecutors and police.
