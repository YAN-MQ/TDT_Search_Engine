The Supreme Court handed President Clinton a legal defeat today that 
could affect the hearings. By a 7-2 vote, the justices rejected arguments 
by Mr. Clinton's attorneys that White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey and 
secret service officers should not have to testify in the independent 
counsel's investigation. The justices agreed with a lower court ruling 
that Lindsey cannot invoke privilege -- "to withhold information relating 
to a federal criminal offense." The White House called the court action 
disappointing. We think that the president, and ultimately the public, 
benefits from the ability to have Frank, full and candid exchanges 
between the president and White House counsel and the lawyers here 
at the White House. And that is something that we are somewhat disappointed 
about. Because I think this will inhibit those Frank and full exchanges.
