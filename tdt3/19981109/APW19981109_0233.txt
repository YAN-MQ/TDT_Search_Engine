Government troops chased the last large group of rebel fighters into 
the mountains on Monday after five days of fighting in the Central 
Asian nation. The 200 rebels concentrated around the town of Aini, 
about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital Dushanbe, tried 
to flee in small groups toward the border of Uzbekistan after suffering 
heavy losses in weekend firefights with government soldiers, who had 
surrounded them. ``Practically all the Aini district is now under 
control of government troops,'' said Tajikistan Security Minister 
Saidamir Zakhurov. Government officials say the rebels would not escape 
because the area is surrounded, the border with Uzbekistan has been 
closed, and all roads have been cut off. Forty rebels were killed 
and 10 government soldiers wounded in the fighting, Tajikistan presidential 
spokesman Zafar Saidov said Sunday evening. Though some of the rebels 
have been captured, the whereabouts of their leader, former army Col. 
Makhmud Khudoberdyev, were unknown, ITAR-Tass said. Khudoberdyev began 
the uprising in northern regions of Tajikistan on Wednesday, demanding 
that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political prisoners and 
bring his supporters into the government. The president has ruled 
out any talks with the rebels. The fighting follows a peace treaty 
last year that ended five years of civil war between the Muslim opposition 
and Rakhmonov's hardline government. Main opposition groups are now 
participating in the government and the armed forces. Still, there 
are many rebel leaders and warlords who ignore the accords and wage 
small-scale attacks across the poor, mountainous former Soviet republic.
