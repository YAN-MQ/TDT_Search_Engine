Following a draw which halted a three-game losing streak in Italy's 
first division, Inter Coach Luigi Simoni looked likely Monday to keep 
his job. ``Simoni is our coach, he's doing a good job. We should just 
let him work,'' the team's President Massimo Moratti was quoted as 
saying by Monday's Gazzetta dello Sport. Simoni has received several 
ultimatums during his rocky one-plus seasons at the helm of Internazionale 
of Milan. The last one came on Nov. 1, when Moratti said Simoni's 
future depended on the results of a Champions League match in Moscow 
and on Sunday's derby against cross-city rival AC Milan. Inter drew 
both matches. It is now only 11th in Italy's 18-team standings. Touted 
at the start of the season as a title contender, Inter has struggled 
with an inconsistent defense and injuries to star strikers Ronaldo 
and Roberto Baggio. Its roster include several other expensive international 
stars such as World Champion Youri Djorkaeff of France, Argentina's 
Diego Simeone and Nigerian Taribo West.
