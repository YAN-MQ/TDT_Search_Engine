The international terrorist known as ``Carlos the Jackal'' was charged 
with crimes against humanity in Romania, and an open bank account 
was found in his name, a military prosecutor said Monday. ``Carlos' 
collaborators' network may still be active in Romania,'' national 
television quoted Gen. Dan Voinea as saying. Voinea announced that 
Romania charged Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, 
of undermining the peace and committing crimes against humanity. He 
did not say when the charges were filed. Prosecutors accused Ramirez 
of committing several terrorist acts in France and Germany between 
1977 and 1981, following orders of Romania's Communist dictator, Nicolae 
Ceausescu. ``The German secret service told us Carlos rented a car 
in Germany using false documents provided by Romania,'' Voinea said. 
He added that Romania's communist-era secret services, the Securitate 
and the Foreign Information Service, had files on Ramirez which might 
be useful to the investigation. ``But these files are still secret,'' 
said the military prosecutor. He did not explain why the files cannot 
be accessed now, nine years after the end of communism. Ramirez is 
imprisoned in France, serving a life term for shooting two French 
police investigators and a Lebanese man. Romanian media reported early 
this year that Ramirez had been employed by Ceausescu to blow up the 
Romanian Service of Radio Free Europe in February 1981. Nine people 
were injured in the attack on the Munich-based radio program, which 
broadcast into communist Eastern Europe. The dictator allegedly was 
infuriated by Radio Free Europe's anti-communist broadcasts and by 
the defection of his intelligence service chief, Gen. Ion Pacepa, 
to the United States in 1978. Ramirez found temporary shelter in Romania 
between 1980 and 1989. Ceausescu was killed during the anti-communist 
revolt in 1989. Ramirez was captured in Sudan in August 1994. The 
48-year-old Venezuelan-born terrorist is believed responsible for 
the deaths of at least 83 people during his terrorist career in Europe 
and the Middle East.
