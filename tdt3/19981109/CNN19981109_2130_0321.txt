Central American leaders are appealing to the international community 
for help in dealing with the devastation left by hurricane Mitch. 
The president of El Salvador held a summit today with his counterparts 
from honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica to discuss recovery. An estimated 
10,000 people lost their lives in the storm and its aftermath. Harris 
whitbeck looks at how the survivors are coping in Nicaragua. a church 
is used as an improvised health clinic. Hundreds of refugees are seen 
by medical volunteers from the United States, the doctors' first priority 
is to treat the infections, respiratory problems and gastrointestinal 
illnesses that many survivors of hurricane mitch are beginning to 
experience. These patients are lucky. They are in areas that are accessible 
to health care workers. I can't imagine what they're seeing in the 
areas that are unaccessible right now. Nicaragua's health ministry 
declared a state of alert in the disaster zone. That is just one step 
below a full quarantine. The minister says that for now, the situation 
is under control. We think that with what we have done so far we can 
avoid any major outbreaks. According to officials, about 80% of the 
disaster area has been visited by health ministry personnel. But even 
though more people are getting primary care, many of the doctors here 
say the real problems won't be seen until two or three months down 
the road. Health workers have incinerated some 600 bodies that have 
been found in fields and roads, but there could be hundreds more under 
the shallow rivers of mud. If it were to rain again or if there were 
more mudslides, many more bodies that cannot be seen now might surface. 
That could bring on serious epidemics of infectious diseases -- some 
cases of cholera, dengue fever and malaria have already been reported. 
Although the international community has sent tons of antibiotics 
and medical assistance to Nicaragua, the problem is still in getting 
that medicine to the areas that need it the most. Work on destroyed 
roads and bridges continues, but it could be weeks before access to 
cut-off communities is reopened. And some fear that might be too late 
to prevent the epidemics that some doctors are predicting. Harris
