HEIDELBERG, Germany (AP) - The U.S. Army on Monday identified two 
pilots who were killed while on a routine training mission when their 
RC-12 reconnaissance plane crashed near the town of Erlach, southeast 
of Wuerzburg on Friday. A statement from the 5th U.S. Army Corps in 
Heidelberg identified the men as Chief Warrant Officer Daniel W. Hunger, 
36, and 2nd Lt. Kelly Hall. Both soldiers were assigned to the 1st 
Military Intelligence Battalion, 205th Military Brigade in Wiesbaden, 
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Frankfurt. Hall is survived 
by his wife Shelly R. Hall and their five children and CWO Hunter 
is survived by his wife Capt. Lori K. Hunter, the statement said. 
The twin-engine RC-12 was on a training flight when it crashed and 
burst into flames in an unpopulated area between Sommerhausen and 
Erlach, the military said. The Beechcraft turboprop was believed to 
have taken off from Wiesbaden, where part of the 5th Corps is based. 
The plane, one of the Army's older models, carries out reconnaissance 
missions as well as other types of flights. An investigation into 
the cause of the accident continues.
