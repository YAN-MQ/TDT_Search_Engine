VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - The judge in the trial of alleged Nazi war 
criminal Aleksandras Lileikis suspended the proceedings indefinitely 
on Monday because Lileikis is too sick to appear in court. Lileikis, 
91, appeared briefly in court last Thursday in a wheelchair, but was 
rushed away in an ambulance after complaining of shortness of breath. 
The judge on Monday said a doctors' report showed Lileikis is suffering 
from serious coronary disease and would be unable to leave the hospital 
for several weeks. Lileikis is charged with genocide for allegedly 
ordering scores of Jews turned over to a Nazi execution squad when 
he was chief of the Vilnius security police during the 1941-44 Nazi 
occupation. The trial was to have begun in September, but was postponed 
after doctors said Lileikis was too ill to come to court. Lithuanian 
law does not allow trial in absentia for medical reasons. A medical 
panel appointed by the court to examine Lileikis at that time confirmed 
that he is in poor health, but said he was capable of appearing in 
court. The repeated delays in getting the trial under way has angered 
critics who claim that Lithuanian authorities have not pushed for 
a speedy trial, perhaps hoping that Lileikis would die. A trial would 
draw new attention to a severely painful period of Lithuania's history. 
About 90 percent of Lithuania's pre-war Jewish population of 240,000 
died during the war years. Lileikis emigrated to the United States 
and lived in Norwood, Massachusetts, where he worked for a Lithuanian 
publishing house. He returned to Lithuania in 1996 as the United States 
was moving to revoke his citizenship on the grounds that he lied about 
his background when he emigrated. Lileikis' lawyer, Algirdas Matuiza, 
applauded the court's Monday ruling. ``This is obviously a question 
of a man's health,'' he said. ``They can't try him in absentia, so 
they have to wait until he's in good shape.But this will definitely 
take time, at least until next year.''
