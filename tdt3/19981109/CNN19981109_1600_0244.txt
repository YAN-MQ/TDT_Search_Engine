Formal impeachment hearings on President Clinton are set to begin 
next week in the house Judiciary committee. As a prelude to that, 
the committee opened a hearing today about what constitutes an impeachable 
offense. 19 scholars are sharing their opinions about whether President 
Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky matter can be construed as 
"high crimes and misdemeanors." Judiciary committee members are also 
reflecting on whether the republican leadership struggle in the house 
will have an impact on the impeachment inquiry.
