Two strong undersea earthquakes within eight minutes rocked parts 
of the eastern Indonesian province of Maluku Monday, but there were 
no immediate reports of damage or casualties, an official said. The 
first quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6, struck at 2:30 p.m. 
(0530 GMT) and was centered in the Banda Sea, 338 kilometers (211 
miles) south of the city of Ambon, said Hardi, an official of the 
Meteorology and Geophysics Agency. A stronger one of 6.4 magnitude 
came within eight minutes, centered about 40 kilometers (25 miles) 
south of the first, he added. ``Both the quakes were felt strongly 
in Ambon, but it seemed that they caused no damage or casualties,'' 
Hardi said. Ambon, about 2,340 kilometers (1,462 miles) east of Jakarta, 
is the provincial capital of Maluku. Indonesia, the world's largest 
archipelago nation, is prone to seismic upheavals because of its location 
on the Pacific ``Ring of Fire,'' a series of volcanoes and fault lines 
from North America through Japan and Southeast Asia to the South Pacific. 
A magnitude 6 earthquake can cause severe damage if centered in an 
urban area. On Sunday, a magnitude 5.5 quake struck Flores and adjacent 
islands in East Nusa Tenggara province, causing panic among residents, 
but there were no reports of damage or casualties. In December 1992, 
an earthquake of magnitude 7 caused tsunami that killed about 2,500 
people in Flores, southwest of Maluku.
