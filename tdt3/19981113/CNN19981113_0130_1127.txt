Agriculture department researchers have developed a device to guard 
against salmonella in chickens. The system clears disease-causing 
organisms from the air in poultry houses, protecting chickens from 
the bacteria. In a test, the system reduced salmonella by 95% in week-old 
birds and in hens that lay eggs. The usda has applied for a patent 
on the system. Several companies are interested in developing it for 
commercial use.
