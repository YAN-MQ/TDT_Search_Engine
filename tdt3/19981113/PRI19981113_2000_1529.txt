International investors have been watching Brazil's shaky economy 
and hoping for a plan to shore up the South American giant. Today, 
they got the news they've been waiting for. Patrick O'Connell has 
details from The World's business desk in New York. It's been a long 
time coming, but at week's close the news has finally arrived. A fund 
of more than $41 billion will be made available to Brazil over the 
next three years. The aim is to shore up the defenses against economic 
contagion and reassure investors who've been burnt by crises elsewhere 
in the world. Lawrence Goodman from Bank Santander says the impact 
could spread far and wide. A successful Brazilian package by extension 
will have an impact throughout the region. And if, in fact, we saw 
Brazil continuing to weaken, it would clearly have a direct effect 
on earnings of a variety of different corporations in the U.S. The 
multinational effort includes funds from the IMF, World Bank and the 
world's richest nations. The U.S. will be contributing $5 billion 
directly. Brazil will need to pay back some of the funds it uses at 
around 9 percent interest rates. The country is also facing a string 
of tough measures at home from tax hikes to spending cuts. Arnaldo 
Jabor is a Brazilian journalist and filmmaker. The Brazilian tradition 
towards the IMF is a tradition of distrust. They view the IMF as something 
very threatening. And lately, IMF has committed many mistakes, mainly 
in Asia and Russia and everything. So we have the hope -- at least 
I hope that the way IMF is handling this situation, together with 
Brazilian economic staff, is going to be more preventive than punishment. 
Because sometimes, like they say, the IMF comes only after the victim's 
dead. The markets in New York had long been expecting today's news. 
Talk of the impending deal over the last few weeks is seen as one 
factor helping to explain the recent rise in the value of stocks. 
For The World, I'm Patrick O'Connell in New York.
