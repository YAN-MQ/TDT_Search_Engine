State department spokesman James Rubin is dismissing demands from 
some in congress that President Clinton seek their approval before 
Iraq is attacked. Rubin says the president has inherent authority 
to use force. Still, others in Congress say it would be politically 
wise for the president to ask Congress for a resolution backing military 
action. I think that the president is not required, but I think it 
would be politically smart, it would be substantively sound, and I 
think from a Foreign policy standpoint it would be bold if he called 
for the entire U.S. congress to come back and ask for their support.
