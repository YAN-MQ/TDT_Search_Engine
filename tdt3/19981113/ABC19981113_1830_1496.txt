Finally this evening, we'll acknowledge a landmark anniversary. Next 
week "Sesame street" begins its 30th year on television. There are 
all sorts of angles to consider, and we are sure there will be long 
essays written about "Sesame street's" place in the culture. We thought 
it might be fun just to pay a visit. And we remembered that 30 years 
ago the producers had noticed that children could memorize commercials 
but not the alphabet or numbers. Do you like the count? Yeah. Me too. 
Television as teacher was a bold experiment. Do you suppose we C count 
together? One, two, three, four. eporter: But "Sesame street" had 
thmuppets. I think the muppets are very affectionate, crazy colorful 
characters. Wonderful characters. That touches people. Puppeteer and 
filmmaker Frank Oz has been with the show since it began. The characters 
break down walls. All the muppets, cookie monster, Oscar the grouch, 
they're all teachers. The show's co-creator is Joan ganz cooney. Are 
children significantly different than they were 30 years ago? They 
are less litter at today than they were 30 yearsing. And you must 
talk about vastly different things We mostly talked about letters 
and numbers and being kind to each other. He's a whale. Now we talk 
about the environment, the world at large, we talk about race relations. 
More than 100 million children worldwide have watched "Sesame street," 
there's now a Palestinian Israeli co-production and a Chinese version. 
Hi there. How are you? The leader of the feathered and fuzzy is big 
bird. What's the most important thing you've been teaching all these 
years? Maybe it's kind of nice to learn to be nice to everybody. Are 
you accused on occasion of being politically correct? yes. That's 
a word you didn't use 30 years ago. We are accused of being of all 
things multicultural, it's a terrible word. I wrote a letter to someone, 
a conservative, who had accused us of that in print and said, yes, 
we are multicultural. That's what I thought this country was as a 
matter of fact. So many people have grown up with the "Sesame street" 
characters. Its impact is almost incalculable. Do you have an anniversary 
thought? It's great that we're touching so many kids while we're having 
fun. 16. 17. 18. 18. Thanks for coming. bye.
