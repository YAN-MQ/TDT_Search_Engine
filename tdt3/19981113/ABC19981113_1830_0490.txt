President Clinton and Paula Jones reached a settlement today to end 
her sexual harassment suit. Against him. After a very long, very public 
legal wrangle, this chapter appears to be over. Here's ABC's Jackie 
Judd. Paula Jones began her lawsuit saying all she wanted was an apology 
from the president. Then she began demanding money. What she ended 
up with was an $850,000 settlement and no admission of any wrongdoing 
by Mr. Clinton. It is not clear how much of the money will actually 
go to Jones and how much will be left for her many lawyers to fight 
over. Both sides had reason to end this now, Jones' case had been 
thrown out by a Lower court judge. Even if it was reinstated, her 
lawyers were not overly optimistic about the outcome. For the president, 
ending the lawsuit in the words of one Ally, removes a Distraction 
from the rest of his term. His lawyers said tonight, the president 
was not prepared to spend even one more hour on the matter.
