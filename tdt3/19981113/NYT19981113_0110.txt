It wasn't fear that made Suzy Benzinger pass out on stage 26 years 
ago, during her high school's production of ``Fiddler on the Roof'' 
in Orchard Park, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb. It was exhaustion. Not only 
was she acting in the play and running the box office, but she had 
designed the sets and posters and, with a teacher, sewn the costumes. 
It was a lesson for a teen-ager intent on a career in the theater: 
You can't do it all. There were more false starts before she learned 
to channel her ambition toward what came naturally _ costume design 
_ and years of work before she hit the big time designing costumes 
in 1991 for the Broadway musical ``Miss Saigon'' and later for three 
Woody Allen films, most recently ``Celebrity,'' with Kenneth Branagh 
and Judy Davis, which opens in theaters on Friday. In high school, 
she often entered talent contests but never won. ``But I always had 
the best costumes,'' she said. ``Lots of crinolines.'' At the State 
University of New York at Stony Brook on Long Island, she told the 
chairman of the theater department she wanted to be a director. ``He 
told me to be something else,'' Ms. Benzinger said. ``He offered to 
put me in charge of the costume department.'' The same professor also 
instilled pragmatism. In one class, she said, he distributed a map 
of Broadway theaters that pinpointed all the neighborhood delis, so 
students would know where to order coffee. After a fight with her 
college boyfriend, Ms. Benzinger dropped out of school in 1978, a 
few months shy of graduation, hoping to get a job at the Studio Arena 
Theater, a professional house in Buffalo. Told there were no openings, 
she decided to apply Woody Allen's maxim that 80 percent of success 
is showing up. ``I went to Studio Arena and said I was there for the 
work-study program, even though I knew they didn't have one,'' she 
recalled. ``Fortunately, someone in the costume shop had quit that 
morning, and they assumed I'd been sent as his replacement.'' The 
job paid only $50 a week but was rewarding in other ways. ``One week 
I was coffee girl for Tennessee Williams,'' she said. ``The producer 
warned me not to let him out of the building before lunch or else 
we'd never see him again.'' By the end of that season, Ms. Benzinger 
had done shows with famous costume designers like Theoni V. Aldredge, 
Florence Klotz and Jane Greenwood. After the final curtain in Buffalo, 
Ms. Benzinger would finally get to the Great White Way. Ms. Greenwood 
secured her a job at the Brooks Van Horn Costume Co. in Manhattan, 
where she worked as a shopper _ gathering materials for costume designers 
_ at the regal salary of $109 a week. Two years later, Ms. Aldredge 
hired her as an assistant, at $500 a week. Over the next decade, Ms. 
Benzinger worked with Ms. Aldredge on shows like ``Dreamgirls,'' ``Annie 
2,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``Merlin,'' ``Chess'' and ``Blithe Spirit,'' as well 
as on the Tony Award-winning costume designs for ``42nd Street'' and 
``La Cage aux Folles.'' Just mentioning the ``Blithe Spirit'' revival, 
starring Richard Chamberlain and Geraldine Page, makes Ms. Benzinger 
cringe. ``I ruined my feet because of Geraldine Page,'' she recalled. 
``It was midnight and there weren't any shoemakers open, and Geraldine's 
boots had to be stretched by morning. I soaked athletic socks in alcohol, 
put them on my feet and then laced the boots up very tightly and slept 
in them.'' Costume design can demand other spontaneous acts of creativity. 
On the set of ``Ghostbusters,'' one of a few movies that Ms. Benzinger 
and Ms. Aldredge worked on, the director gave Ms. Benzinger an hour 
to produce weathered-looking leather jackets. ``I went down to Eighth 
Street and bought them right off people's backs,'' she said. Ms. Benzinger 
set out on her own in 1991 and soon got her big break. Cameron Mackintosh, 
the producer, had liked her work on other shows and asked her to design 
costumes for ``Miss Saigon.'' She would receive design credit, a fee 
and royalties for as long as the musical ran. (It's still running.) 
``Miss Saigon'' made her enough money to buy a spacious loft in TriBeCa 
but was no guarantee of future success. Her next job was designing 
costumes for ``Ain't Broadway Grand,'' which turned out to be anything 
but. It closed after two weeks. Perhaps it was just as well. ``I was 
totally drained,'' she said. ``When you work on a show, it's 24-hour 
days, seven days a week. You have no life.'' To get away from it all, 
she volunteered to assist her brother-in-law, a veterinarian in the 
Park Slope section of Brooklyn. ``I loved it,'' she said. ``The day 
had a beginning and an end. And I didn't have a director or choreographer 
coming up to me and saying, `I really think that the dog should look 
like this.' '' But she would be gone before the end of tick season. 
The production designer Santo Loquasto tracked her down as she was 
organizing heartworm vaccinations and invited her to meet with Allen 
to design costumes for ``Deconstructing Harry.'' That led to the jobs 
on the other Allen films. She spent last summer designing costumes 
for the musical ``Mirette'' at the not-for-profit Goodspeed Opera 
House in East Haddam, Conn. She acknowledged that her pay of $5,000 
didn't even cover expenses, but said she couldn't care less. ``They 
give me the freedom to design whatever I want,'' she said, adding 
with a laugh, ``It's an investment in restoring my sanity after doing 
movies or a Broadway show.''
