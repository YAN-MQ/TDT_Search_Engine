In his first public statement since the start of the dispute over 
U.N. weapons inspections, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Friday 
he was not trying to create a crisis or stop cooperation with the 
United Nations. The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Saddam as saying 
his decisions Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 to restrict the activities of U.N. 
weapons inspectors ``were intended to get responses to Iraq's legal 
demands.'' He didn't elaborate, but apparently was talking about Iraq's 
often-stated demand to lift the punishing U.N. trade sanctions imposed 
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
