In a move that officials and environmentalists hailed as a significant 
step toward restoring the balance of water in the Everglades, Florida 
officials have decided to buy out hundreds of residents who live in 
an unincorporated area of west Miami-Dade County. The decision, which 
was approved Thursday by the South Florida Water Management District, 
follows almost a decade of discussion about how to restore the natural 
flow of water to the Everglades. It also heightens the debate between 
supporters of the plan and about 400 homeowners, some of whom have 
lived in the area of nine and one-half square miles for more than 
20 years. The area, which floods regularly despite a levee built to 
protect it, is the gateway for fresh water that flows south from Lake 
Okeechobee, feeding Everglades National Park and Florida Bay. Thursday's 
decision came months after a study commissioned by the management 
district concluded that buying the land and returning it to its natural 
state as wetlands was the most cost-effective way to provide proper 
water flow to the Everglades. Officials estimate that it will cost 
$115 million to $120 million to buy the houses and lots. The U.S. 
Department of the Interior will pay half; the state and the county 
will be responsible for the other half. While some residents have 
already sold their land to the state, others said the buyout was an 
ill-conceived substitute for federal flood-prevention plans. One resident, 
Madeleine Fortin, 48, said she planned to appeal to Congress. ``They've 
asked me to sell my house,'' Ms. Fortin, a nurse and anthropology 
student who has lived in the area for four years, said. ``I told them 
I'd burn it down first. ``Congress gave us flood protection. What 
good is our democratic system if the will of Congress is meaningless 
in Florida?'' Last month, the Army Corps of Engineers unveiled an 
$8 billion proposal to transform the supply of water through a system 
of reservoirs and channels. The web of canals and levees completed 
by the corps 20 years ago does not adequately regulate water flow 
to the Everglades, sometimes flooding the area and at other times 
leaving it parched. ``In the long term, the best thing to do is have 
the area under government control,'' said John Renfrow, the director 
of the Miami-Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management. 
``It would be restored to a wetland area. We would try to mimic natural 
conditions.''
