The Pentagon says it is ready to launch a military strike against 
Iraq if and when President Clinton gives the order. It could be a 
week before U.S. forces are in place in the Persian gulf. Military 
aircraft, including 12 B-52 bombers, are leaving the United States 
today for positions near the gulf. At FT. Stewart, Georgia, 3,000 
troops are preparing to go to Kuwait to join the 1,000 there. Commanders 
say those troops could be ready to leave within 72-hours of orders. 
I'd sum it up by saying these are cool professionals. They know what 
they have to do, and they're prepared to do the job, and their attitude 
is great. And I'm very, very proud of what I've seen here today and 
all the soldiers that are involved in this operation.
