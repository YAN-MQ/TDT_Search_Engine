Elton John is doing something he hasn't done in 27 years -- write 
a movie score. "Variety" magazine reports the British singer will 
compose the music for the Albert Brooks movie, "the muse." John has 
written songs for "the lion king" and other Disney animated movies. 
This will be his first complete movie score since "friends" in 1971.
