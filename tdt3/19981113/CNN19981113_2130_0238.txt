Iraqi President Saddam Hussein says the Burden is on the United Nations 
to lift sanctions before he will cooperate with weapons inspectors. 
Those comments were among his first since this crisis began. He says 
he would accept any initiative that would end the sanctions. President 
Clinton says Iraq merely is trying to confuse the issues and avoid 
compliance with U.N. resolutions altogether. Iraq's continued refusal 
to embrace a diplomatic, peaceful solution, its continued defiance 
of even more United Nations resolutions, makes it plainer than ever 
that its real goal is to end the sanctions without giving up its weapons 
of mass destruction program. The security council and the world have 
made it Crystal clear, now, that this is unacceptable, that none of 
us can tolerate an Iraq free to develop weapons of mass destruction 
with impunity.
