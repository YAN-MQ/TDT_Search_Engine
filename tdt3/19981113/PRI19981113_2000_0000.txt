This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and 
WGBH Boston. It's Friday, November 13. I'm Tony Kahn. Today, the Pentagon's 
options for striking Iraq and the case for debt relief for Central 
American nations ravaged by Hurricane Mitch. I am absolutely convinced 
that we, for the sake of humanity, had better get some real help and 
soon. Also ahead, slamming Sammy Sosa -- knocking them out in Japan. 
The media have been swarming him in the same kind of way as hysterical 
fans would. And I saw people getting autographs and so on. And beware 
the duppies of Jamaica. First, this news. For The World, I'm Derek 
Stothel in the BBC newsroom in London.
