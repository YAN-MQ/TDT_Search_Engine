Nepal's prime minister has offered a general amnesty to the Maoist 
insurgents if they agree to surrender their arms. Speaking to his 
Nepali Congress Party workers Thursday night in the western town of 
Pokhara, Girija Prasad Koirala urged the guerrillas to give up their 
battle. More than 350 people have been killed since the insurgency 
began 2 1/2 years ago. The guerrillas oppose Nepal's constitutional 
monarchy and want Nepal to be turned into a republic. Koirala said 
he also invited the guerrillas to join in the task of nation-building. 
There was no immediate comment Friday from the insurgents to Koirala's 
offer.
