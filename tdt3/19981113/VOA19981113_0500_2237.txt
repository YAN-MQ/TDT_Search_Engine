10 hours, 37 Universal time. Unrest is stirring in Jakarta, Indonesia 
for the second day, today. At least 100 people were injured Thursday, 
as thousands of demonstrators and security forces clashed near the 
Parliament building. The day started quietly in the capitol, Friday, 
but violence erupted again, outside the Parliament building. Reporter 
Jenny Grant spoke to us from the scene. I'm standing with a big group 
of students and also people who have come out. They are residents. 
At the moment they are trying to throw stones in the direction of 
the Parliament. There are lines of military and mobile brigade police 
in front of these people, trying to stop the stone throwing. The police 
have fired into this crowd, but there is literally thousands and thousands 
of people here. Now, just a couple of hours ago, things were pretty 
quiet. What do you think was the trigger that put people in the streets 
again in Jakarta for the second day of violence? Well, people were 
basically waiting until around until mid-day -- today is a prayer 
day being a Muslim country. So after prayers everyone came out of 
their houses to express support for the students. What began the incident 
here, there was a vigilante group that had been paid to come and support 
the parliamentarian assembly. And they came and provoked a lot of 
the people who live around this area. So that began the stone throwing, 
and now it has gotten out of control. How out of control? Are police 
resorting to violence in trying to push back these protesters? No, 
the police are being very controlled at the moment. There was violence 
last night. But, so far, they are just trying to keep the crowd separated 
enough so that they are not overpowered in numbers. But the people 
here say that they are now waiting for thousands of students who are 
making their way towards this area. Once the students join this group, 
we will have a mass of maybe up to 20,000 people trying to enter the 
Parliament. So, the situation is getting fairly serious here. Jenny 
Grant is in Jakarta. We'll be checking back with you, Jenny, throughout 
the day.
