The game was for sole possession of first place in the Atlantic Division 
and a tie for the lead in the Eastern Conference, but the Pittsburgh 
Penguins approached it rather lackadaisically until the third period 
Friday night. With the Penguins spending plenty of time watching during 
the first 40 minutes, the New Jersey Devils scored the game's first 
three goals and went on to a 4-3 triumph before a crowd of 17,452 
at Continental Arena in a game that marked the popular referee Paul 
Stewart after an absence due to colon cancer. Perhaps inspired by 
the return of Stewart, a friend of coach Robbie Ftorek _ the two lived 
together in Ftorek's house when they both played for the Quebec Nordiques 
_ the Devils started with gusto. Brian Rolston got the Devils on the 
right path with his second goal of the season 2 minutes 30 seconds 
after Stewart dropped his first puck this season to start a game. 
Rolston beat Tom Barrasso from the right circle, converting Jay Pandolfo's 
pass from behind the goal. Randy McKay scored his second goal of the 
season by jumping on a rebound of a Scott Stevens shot at 9:23, before 
Jason Arnott gave the Devils the three-goal cushion with his second 
goal of the season, a blistering shot from the left circle. Arnott's 
goal, with 5:12 left in the first period, came on the Devils' first 
manpower advantage of the game. The Penguins are next-to-last in the 
league in penalty-killing efficiency. The Penguins narrowed the gap 
with a second left in the first period when Martin Straka deflected 
Kevin Hatcher's shot for his sixth goal of the season. It was only 
the third shot in the game against Chris Terreri, who made his third 
appearance of the season, giving Martin Brodeur a rest because the 
Devils face the Flyers in Philadelphia on Saturday night. Terreri 
was busy in the early stages of the third period, when the Penguins 
played with more enthusiasm and tied the score with goals by Stu Barnes 
and Aleksei Morozov 45 seconds apart. Barnes scored his fifth goal 
3:03 into the period when he converted a rebound from a shot by Jaromir 
Jagr while he was standing in the low slot unattended. Morozov's goal 
beat Terreri cleanly over the glove from near the bottom of the right 
circle. But the Devils came back strong and got their victory with 
5:07 left, when McKay went around the net from right to left and beat 
Barrasso from close range. SLAP SHOTS _ DAVE ANDREYCHUK missed his 
third consecutive game with what the Devils called a bruised sternum. 
Andreychuk will also miss Saturday's game in Philadelphia, but he 
is probable for Thursday's game against Carolina. _ SHELDON SOURAY 
was the odd man out on defense, with BRAD BOMBARDIR taking his place. 
_ KRZYSZTOF OLIWA was scratched for the first time this season.
