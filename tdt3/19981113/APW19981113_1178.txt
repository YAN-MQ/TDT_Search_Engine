Two Yugoslav soldiers were killed Friday in a new outbreak of violence, 
further fueling tensions in the strife-torn Kosovo province. Duncan 
Bullivant, an international official, said according to information 
from the Yugoslav Army and foreign Ministry, an incident occurred 
at around 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) in the village of Dulje on the road connecting 
Pristina, the capital, and Prizren near the Albanian border. Bullivant, 
a spokesman for the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, quoted the Yugoslav officials as saying that one soldier 
died on the spot and the other succumbed to his injuries. Another 
two wounded soldiers were taken to a hospital in Pristina. He spoke 
of ``a clear breach of the spirit of the peace agreement.''
