Liverpool stars Paul Ince and Steve McManaman have been suspended 
for three and two European matches respectively for violent conduct 
in a UEFA Cup match against Valencia, UEFA said Friday. Amedeo Carboni 
of the Spanish side was also suspended for two European club matches. 
All three were sent off as the sides tied 2-2, with Liverpool advancing 
on away goals to the competition' third round. Another Spanish club, 
Real Mallorca, had Iovan Stankovic suspended for four matches following 
violent conduct in his team's Cup Winners Cup match against Genk of 
Belgium. In other decisions, Real Madrid and the Hungarian soccer 
association were both fined 15,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 11,000) for 
repeatedly selling stadium places beyond the authorized capacity. 
UEFA confiscated a further 40,000 francs (dlrs 29,500) from Real and 
50,000 francs (dlrs 37,000) from Hungary, which it said corresponds 
to the additional revenue from the extra places. The control and disciplinary 
committee also rejected a protest by PSV Eindhoven, which wanted to 
replay a Champions League match against Germany's Kaiserslautern.
