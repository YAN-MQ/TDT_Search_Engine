The Orsay Museum of 19th century art remained closed Friday for the 
fourth straight day, and personnel voted to extend the strike for 
better working conditions, museum officials said. Museum employees 
are protesting what they call increasingly difficult working conditions 
at the museum which houses France's largest collection of Impressionist 
masterpieces. The employees link worsening conditions to the huge 
crowds visiting the popular temporary exhibition ``Millet-Van Gogh.'' 
The show, which opened in September to wide critical acclaim, presents 
dozens of Van Gogh paintings side-by-side with the works by Jean-Francois 
Millet which inspired them. It runs through Jan. 3. The Orsay Museum, 
a renovated train station overlooking the Seine, is one the city's 
most popular tourist attractions, drawing some 3 million visitors 
annually.
