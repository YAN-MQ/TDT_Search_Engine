The Kansas State Wildcats and the Tennessee Volunteers head into the 
weekend as the top ranked teams in US college football. Tennessee 
is number one on the Associated Press poll while Kansas State is the 
top team on the weekly poll of coaches. Wild Cat's head coach, Bill 
Snyder says his players cannot worry about the polls, they just have 
to play well. We've always felt that we've been in a position where 
we have no control over those things. And all we can really do is, 
you know, try to get certain plays as well as we can. And try to realize 
that our destiny is probably in our own hands. UCLA is currently the 
third-ranked team, followed by Florida and Florida State. Ohio State, 
which was Number One until losing at home to Michigan State last week 
is seeking to revive its national championship, hopes after tumbling 
to number seven.
