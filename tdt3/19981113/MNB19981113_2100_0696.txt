A busy week ahead on Capitol Hill. This Wednesday, house republicans 
will choose the leaders of the 106th session of Congress, including 
a new house speaker to replace Newt gingrich. And on Thursday, the 
house Judiciary committee begins impeachment hearing formally with 
Ken Starr laying out his case as the only witness on Thursday against 
President Clinton. Here tonight with a preview, NBC news Capitol Hill 
correspondent, Gwen ifill. Gwen, we know that Mr. Livingston is all 
but a shoe-in for the job as speaker, but what about the other posts? 
And what are the stakes here as the republicans come off the revolutionary 
leader shitch and go into something of much more of a holding pattern? 
The big fight right here is for the number two job, the majority leader, 
now held by Dick Armey, a tough-talking Texan who has held the job 
under newt Gingrich. A lot of the most unhappy members of the rebel 
class in the house has decided maybe the entire leadership should 
go, which includes Dick Armey. So, he's being challenged by Jennifer 
Dunn, a woman, from Washington state, and by Steve Largent, a former 
football player. They, as happens in these kind of fights, everyone 
has a vote. I think each one of the three have said they have the 
112 votes they need, which, of course, is mathematically impossible. 
So, they're now getting commitments they say from their colleagues, 
but it's a secret ballot. Nobody will know who voted what way. That's 
where that big fight plays out, probably not until it hits the floor 
on Wednesday. And the number three job, J.C. Watts, is challenging 
John bay nor from ohio. J.C. Watts would bring a distinction the way 
that Jennifer Dunn would, being the first black in such a high leadership 
post. So, there is some argument being made that the republican party 
after last week's fiasco in the elections, needs to come up with a 
kinder, gentler way of presenting itself to the American people. But 
the question is whether these folks have the votes, the harder way 
of measuring success.
