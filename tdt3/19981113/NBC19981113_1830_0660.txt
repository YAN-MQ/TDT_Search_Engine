The other big news from Washington tonight, the president and Paula 
Jones have settled her sexual harassment case against him. This is 
the end a long, ugly battle that spawned the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
More on this story tonight from NBC's Lisa Myers. After 4 1/2 bitter 
years, Paula Jones' lawyers notified the court late this afternoon 
that the case that brought President Clinton to the brink of impeachment 
has been settled. The deal requires the president to pay Jones $850,000 
within two months but does not include any apology or admission of 
wrongdoing. Sources close to the president say they are optimistic 
the money will come from insurance companies not from the Clintons. 
Tonight, the president, through his lawyer, again called Jones' charge 
that he exposed himself and asked for sex "baseless." Then, why would 
he pay $850,000 to settle the case? Because, his lawyer says -- in 
fact, while the president was dealing with iraq, he also was taking 
calls from Bennett on settling this case. Tonight, in the Jones' camp, 
a sense of vindication. Even before the settlement, polls show more 
than half of Americans believe something happened to Paula Jones in 
that hotel room. This nation owes Paula Jones a real thank you. I 
think she exposed him for what he was. There would have been no impeachment, 
no Monica Lewinsky, no Kathleen willey. There would have been nothing 
without the Paula Jones case. This does not mean the president is 
entirely free of this case. The trial judge still can hold him in 
contempt for lying to her court. And she has signaled that she just 
might do it. Lisa Myers, NBC news, Washington.
