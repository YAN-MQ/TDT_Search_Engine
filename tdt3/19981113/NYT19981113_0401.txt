Jake Fay throws the passes. Matt Perceval catches them. Fay-to-Perceval 
has accounted for 12 touchdowns this season, seven of them in Wesleyan's 
55-28 season-opening victory over Middlebury, a Division III record. 
According to National Collegiate Athletic Association records, only 
one player has caught more. Paul Zaeske of North Park University in 
Chicago caught eight in a 1968 Division II game. Fay and Perceval 
are the best of friends, classmates, roommates, economics majors and 
cogs on one of the better Wesleyan teams in recent decades. Besides 
that, they are having a very good time. ``I really like it here,'' 
Perceval said. ``I'm so glad I came.'' He came a long way, from Box 
Elder, S.D. ``Near Rapid City,'' he said. Fay is from ``just up the 
road,'' he said, meaning Glastonbury, Conn. Football at Wesleyan, 
and at the nine other members of the New England Small College Athletic 
Conference, is perhaps what Norman Rockwell had in mind when he painted 
Saturday Evening Post covers 60 years ago depicting autumnal splendor. 
This is football full of good cheer, empty of evil, on leafy campuses 
of reputable, old liberal arts colleges. And it is good football. 
Wesleyan coach Frank Hauser has put together an offense that has scored 
240 points in seven games and has all the devices of more celebrated 
teams at higher echelons. Fay's passing game is supplemented by the 
seniors Tom Themistocles and John Pascucci, described by Hauser as 
running backs as good as ``you'll find in small-college football.'' 
After winning their first four games, and extending a winning streak 
to seven, dating from last season, the Cardinals (5-2) lost to Amherst 
in overtime, beat Bowdoin and then were routed by unbeaten Williams 
(7-0) last Saturday, 57-19. The team's resiliency will be tested, 
Hauser suspects, in its finale here this Saturday against Trinity 
(2-5). Division III college football means no athletic scholarships 
and, in the case of the 10 NESCAC members, no playoffs, no bowl games, 
no spring practice, no league standings and no recruiting off the 
campus. The league's credo is, ``The conference was created in 1971 
out of a concern for the direction of intercollegiate programs, and 
it remains committed to keeping a proper perspective on the role of 
sport in higher education.'' Williams coach Dick Farley once said: 
`'If you can't play here, you can't play anywhere. There is no Division 
IV.'' Fay and Perceval can play. That was established in their freshman 
seasons, when Fay became the Cardinals' starting quarterback following 
an injury to an upperclassman. The two had met that fall at their 
first football practice. They connected right away, and have been 
throwing the football 10 months out of the year ever since. ``We never 
exactly quit,'' Fay said. As juniors they have nine games left before 
this euphoric life concludes _ this fall's final game and eight next 
year. Although there are not supposed to be formal league standings, 
everyone keeps track. Williams has been the dominant force under Farley, 
whose teams since 1987 have won 80, lost 12 and tied 3. The Ephs play 
at Amherst (5-2) today with the Little Three title at stake. The Little 
Three _ Amherst, Wesleyan and Williams _ was put together long ago 
when Harvard, Princeton and Yale were called football's Big Three. 
As for crowds, Wesleyan had its largest in years, 6,290, for the Amherst 
game, and 7,190 were at Weston Field in Williamstown, Mass., for the 
Williams game last Saturday. Hauser's Cardinals were 7-1 last year, 
their best record since they were undefeated in 1969, and they beat 
Williams last year for the first time since 1985. Football began here 
in 1881, and Wesleyan's prowess has been limited. (The 1886 team lost 
to Yale, 136-0.) Cardinal teams have won the Little Three competition 
only 12 times, to 26 for Amherst and 40 for Williams. These Little 
Three games are special, Fay said with a glint in his eye. ``The intensity 
level, the emotion, they're really something,'' he said. ``Beating 
Williams last year was so great.'' What about this year? ``We got 
blown out,'' he said, after completing 20 of 39 passes for 308 yards 
and a touchdown. The scoring pass went to Perceval, who runs the 40-yard 
dash in 4.4 seconds and is the team's kick-return specialist. Hauser 
said if he had a problem with Fay, it was keeping him free of self-blame. 
Fay, for example, assumed the fault was his in the overtime loss to 
Amherst. Now about Perceval's seven touchdown catches in the opening 
game. Fay said he remembered the first and third ones but not the 
others. Perceval, acting shy, recounted one or two, a slant here, 
a fade there. Two were for 57 and 64 yards, and six of them came in 
the first half. If they had only saved a few for the Williams game.
