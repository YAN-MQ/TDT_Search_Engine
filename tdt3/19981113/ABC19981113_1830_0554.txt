A couple of other personalities in the president's life in the news 
today. Kathleen Willey. Right. Ken Starr sent two more boxes of evidence 
up to Capitol Hill regarding kathleen Willey and her allegation that 
the president made an unwanted sexual advance towards her. The question 
here is did the president perjure himself when he denied under oath 
the incident took place? Starr did not characterize what he found. 
He's basically leaving that up to Congress.
