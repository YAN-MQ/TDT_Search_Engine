Golf's five major tours will be telecast worldwide each weekend under 
a deal announced Friday by CNBC Sports, a joint venture between American 
broadcaster NBC and the London-based sports marketing company Parallel 
Sport. The golf coverage will be carried on CNBC, NBC's satellite 
business channel. In addition to golf, the weekly 12 hours of sports 
programing will also include tennis, sailing and Alpine skiing. CNBC, 
the business channel launched in 1989, has been offering spot sports 
coverage, but this will be its first venture into regular coverage 
with eight hours each weekend dedicated to golf tournaments. Coverage 
begins in January and will include the PGA tours in North America, 
Europe, Asia, Australia and South Africa. ``The PGA is excited about 
the new partnership and it will offer us expanded in both Europe and 
Asia,'' said U.S. PGA Commissioner Timothy Finchem. Although the coverage 
will be obtainable anywhere in the world with a satellite dish, it's 
biggest impact is expected in Europe and Asia. Coverage will be in 
English. Financial terms of the ``long-term'' deal were not disclosed.
