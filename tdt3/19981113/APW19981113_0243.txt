Three of four students, arrested last week for spraying antigovernment 
graffiti, were released Friday, amid expanding plans to protest government 
control of their university. Teodora Tabacki, Marina Glisic and Dragana 
Milinkovic were detained and sentenced to 10 days in prison after 
they were caught spraying a clenched fist, the symbol of student resistance. 
The fourth student's release was expected later Friday. Belgrade university 
students are no stranger to protest. They participated in three months 
of antigovernment demonstrations in 1996. Now they are calling for 
protests throughout the university against a law that allows the government 
to name the dean and the professors without any input from students 
or faculty. Several prominent law and engineering professors have 
been sacked in the past several weeks. Most belong to opposition parties 
or have criticized President Slobodan Milosevic. For the past decade 
of Milosevic's rule _ first over Serbia, a Yugoslav republic, and 
then over Yugoslavia proper _ Belgrade university has been the center 
of pro-democracy movement. During the 1996 street demonstrations against 
annulment of an opposition victory in Serbian cities, the students 
added most of the humor and imagination to the movement. After three 
months, Milosevic's autocratic government was forced to back down 
and hand over power to opposition in many towns. But the victory was 
temporary _ the political opposition crumbled, leaving his government 
as a strong as ever. Authorities recently moved against the university 
and independent media by passing two restrictive laws aimed at curbing 
opponents at home. Following dismissal of several professors, the 
students started organizing protests and boycotts of lectures held 
by their replacements. On Thursday the student organization ``Otpor'' 
(Resistance), called for a strike at the philology department after 
the new dean, a member of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, 
suspended several professors and closed down the world literature 
section. The dean, Radmilo Marojevic, said there was no need to study 
world literature. Boris Karajicic, a student activist, said a general 
boycott of the philology faculty would start Nov. 23 and last until 
Marojevic is replaced and all his decisions are annulled. Similar 
actions can be expected at other faculties.
