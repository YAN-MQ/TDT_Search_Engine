Descendants of Sioux warriors pleaded with the city of Glasgow Friday 
to return a shirt believed to have been taken from a body of a man 
killed on the battlefield of Wounded Knee in 1890. The ``ghost'' shirt, 
which warriors believed would protect them in battle, is on display 
at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery. It is said to be stained with 
the blood of a warrior from the infamous battle, which was the last 
major conflict between Indians and U.S. troops. The shirt should be 
brought home to help the people heal their grief, Marcella Le Beau, 
secretary of the Wounded Knee Survivors' Association, said at a hearing 
held in another of the city's museums. A working group is scheduled 
to make a recommendation to the city council Nov. 19. ``For the remaining 
descendants it will bring closure to the sad and horrible event in 
the history of our people and the return of the ghost dance shirt 
would bring about some healing,'' said Mrs. Le Beau, who lives in 
South Dakota. ``The sacred shirt was stolen from the back of a warrior 
whose body was buried naked in a mass grave,'' she said. ``No culture 
in the world would do this. It is not the proper thing to do.'' Along 
with other American Indian artifacts, the shirt was brought to Glasgow 
in 1891 with Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West traveling show and was 
taken to the art gallery, where it has remained ever since. The effort 
to have the religious artifact repatriated to the Lakota Sioux began 
when Georgia lawyer John Earl, of Cherokee descent, saw it in the 
art gallery six years ago and informed the Wounded Knee Survivors' 
Association of his find. ``The shirt is not really the issue, it is 
about the treatment of the Lakota people by the U.S.,'' Earl told 
the hearing. ``It is about the rebuilding of self esteem and of a 
nation suppressed. I think it would be the honorable thing for the 
shirt to be returned.'' The Lakota people wish to build a museum at 
Wounded Knee and the South Dakota Historical Society has also agreed 
to store the shirt. But Mark O'Neill, head of curatorial services 
for Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries, said the city wants to keep 
the shirt and that it is among very few objects with a Wounded Knee 
provenance in Europe. ``There are few other objects in our collections 
which can communicate so powerfully the bloody consequences of the 
encounter between Europeans and first people all over the world.'' 
But he said he could understand the argument for returning the shirt. 
``While history in general cannot be unraveled, it may be the right 
thing to do to unravel this particular part and return the shirt,'' 
he said. ``It may make a genuine contribution to the search of the 
Lakota people for healing which will enable them to move forward to 
find a new identity.''
