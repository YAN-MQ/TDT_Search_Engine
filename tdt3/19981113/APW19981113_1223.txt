The difference between ``The Full Monty'' and ``The Full Monarchy'' 
is elemental: Prince Charles keeps his clothes on. But the heir to 
the throne was a hit nonetheless Friday at a 50th birthday party staged 
in his honor featuring cast members from the hit film about unemployed 
Sheffield men who turn to stripping. The icing on a birthday cake 
in the shape of a security guard's cap proclaimed ``The Full Monarchy.'' 
Taking a lead from Hugo Speer, who played ``Lunchbox'' in the 1997 
film, Charles quickly mastered the steps and joined in recreating 
the scene where the men start dancing while waiting in line at a job 
center. ``I've even been given a bit of choreography on how to do 
things in a queue,'' Charles said. ``He's a cinch _ a natural,'' Speer 
said of the prince. ``He asked for a few tips but didn't need them. 
It looks like he's been practicing in his bedroom.'' During an earlier 
visit to a drug rehabilitation center in Sheffield, Charles encountered 
a warm admirer in 78-year-old Elaine Glaza. ``Can I kiss you?'' she 
asked. ``Absolutely,'' said Charles, and some bystanders shouted ``Go 
on, Charlie!'' Mrs. Glaza also gave him cufflinks and a carnation. 
Later Friday night, Queen Elizabeth II hosted a glittering party at 
Buckingham Palace, attended by royals and VIPs for the worlds of architecture, 
science, farming, politics and poetry. She toasted his ``vision, compassion 
and leadership.'' ``Here Here,'' the guests exclaimed as the palace 
ballroom echoed with applause. Referring to the queen as ``Mummy, 
coupled with your Majesty,'' the prince replied he did not know how 
either of his parents had ``put up with'' him. Charles, who reaches 
the half-century mark Saturday, began his birthday celebrations Thursday 
night with a private party at Hampton Court Palace. Camilla Parker 
Bowles, Charles' longtime love, was among the guests Thursday, but 
the event produced no pictures of the two of them together. She is 
hosting a party for Charles on Saturday at Highgrove, his country 
home.
