Buffeted by political and economic pressures, oil companies drilling 
in the Caspian Sea are postponing their much-awaited decision on where 
to lay their main export pipeline. The oil consortium canceled a meeting 
scheduled for Thursday at which members were to discuss pipeline routes. 
No date for another meeting was announced. The Clinton administration 
is lobbying intensely for a route across Turkey that would favor U.S. 
interests. Russia and Iran have proposed routes of their own. This 
heavy political crossfire, coupled with low oil prices and uncertainty 
about how much oil lies beneath the Caspian, has made the companies 
reluctant to choose. Under a 1994 contract between Azerbaijan and 
11 foreign companies, including four from the United States, the companies 
were to have chosen an export route by last month. When that deadline 
passed, executives said they would probably decide in November, but 
now that seems unlikely. ``We don't have a deadline for a decision,'' 
said Pamela Mounter, spokeswoman for the consortium. ``There are a 
lot of meetings going on with governments and organizations. This 
is a pipeline for the long term, and it's much too important to be 
rushed into.'' Diplomats and oil executives said the postponement 
would give Turkey time to improve its offer to the companies. U.S. 
officials are urging Turkey to offer subsidies big enough to close 
what oil executives call the ``billion-dollar gap'' between the cost 
of this route and others. The postponement also reflects oil executives' 
hopes that U.S. policy toward Iran could change, making a pipeline 
through Iran possible. ``The companies never say it publicly, but 
they are very much hoping that if they wait long enough, they will 
be able to build their pipeline through Iran, which is the route most 
of them favor,'' a European ambassador said. ``So the decision that 
is supposed to be coming soon may well be no decision at all.'' Sen. 
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence, visited Azerbaijan this week and said that he fervently 
hopes for an improvement in Iranian-U.S. relations that would make 
a pipeline there possible. ``That would be the cheapest and the shortest 
route,'' Shelby said in an interview. ``I'd like to see it happen. 
Lots of us in Congress would like to see relations with Iran improve 
tremendously. ``I hope there will be a thaw, a real one. We'd go the 
first mile and probably the last mile. But the other side has to meet 
us. Iran has to show that it can be relied on as far as controlling 
terrorism and other things that would help strengthen the family of 
nations.'' The outcome of the pipeline contest, which is being closely 
followed in many capitals, could hinge in part on whether a second 
oil consortium strikes it rich in a promising Caspian field called 
Shah Deniz. The Shah Deniz consortium does not include any U.S. companies, 
so it would be free to support a pipeline through Iran. Geological 
data suggest that Shah Deniz could be a very rich field, but results 
of the first test drilling will not be known until early next year. 
If they confirm high estimates, the pipeline picture could change 
suddenly. ``We're not here to play politics; we're here to make money,'' 
said Mike Shearman, a British Petroleum executive who heads the Shah 
Deniz consortium. ``We'd be foolish to rule out any option.'' During 
a recent visit to Istanbul, Turkey, President Clinton's special envoy 
to the Caspian region, Richard Morningstar, urged the companies to 
weigh their options ``in a broader political and economic context'' 
and not to ignore ``political considerations and political realities.'' 
On his return to Washington, Morningstar acknowledged that it was 
unlikely that the oil companies would decide to build a pipeline to 
Turkey anytime soon. But he said any statement they make about their 
intentions should include a ``concrete commitment'' to build a line 
to Turkey at some point in the future and a pledge to begin ``intense 
negotiations'' with Turkey over ways to bring down the cost of the 
line. ``I don't think you'll see a decision this year,'' said Brian 
Chipman, an investment adviser based in Baku. ``There may be some 
statements or even signatures, but nothing firm as far as committing 
money. The companies want to put things off as long as possible.''
