NBC news "in depth" -- more on our top story, target Iraq. Tonight, 
the newest weapons in America's arsenal -- why military planners hope 
this time around, an attack on Iraq would end up more successful. 
It's not just because of U.S. firepower, it's also because of new 
intelligence we begin our "in depth" reporting tonight with NBC's 
Jim miklaszewski, who joins us now from the Pentagon. During the gulf 
war, 60,000 combat air strikes failed to take out saddam Hussein or 
his weapons of mass destruction. But this time, the Pentagon believes 
U.S. forces may have a better shot. NBC news has learned that in their 
attempts to get inside Saddam Hussein's inner circle, U.S. officials 
think they've hit an intelligence motherlode. Sources report that 
through various means, U.S. intelligence has been able to tap directly 
into Saddam's internal decision making process. It's given the us 
new insights into Saddam's most secret operations and provided military 
planners with a whole new list of targets that pinpoint saddam's entire 
leadership structure. The first waves of air strikes will target the 
forces that keep Saddam in power -- command bunkers. The leaders of 
his secret police and intelligence service and many of saddam's private 
residences. And since the gulf war, U.S. forces have feeled a more 
deadly and accurate arsenal of smart bombs and missiles, including 
a hardened bomb that penetrated underground bunkers, armed with a 
smart fuse that counts the number of floors and detonates on cue. 
A new cluster bomb, with a deadly spray of bomblets that could kill 
40 tanks or planes in a single shot. With all the new intelligence 
and weapons, it should be easier then, to take out Saddam Hussein. 
The U.S. openly admits they wouldn't mind if they happen to get him 
with a Lucky shot. tom? Thanks very much, Jim had Miklaszewski at 
the Pentagon.
