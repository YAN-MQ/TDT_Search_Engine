A new study raises questions about the privatization of social security. 
The employee benefit research institute finds fully privatizing social 
security into individual accounts presents huge logistical hurdles, 
administrative problems and additional costs for employers. The study 
concludes creating 148 million individual social security accounts 
may be the largest undertaking ever attempted in U.S. financial markets. 
The report says no system to date has the capacity to administer that. 
Supporters of personal investment accounts say they still are the 
best option, and the problems can be overcome.
