A relatively strong earthquake jolted southwest Iran late Friday, 
causing landslides that blocked roads to the area, the official Iranian 
news agency reported. The quake of magnitude 5.7 shook the Khonj-e 
Lar area of Fars province for 16 seconds, the Islamic Republic News 
Agency said in a report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. 
No information was immediately available about possible casualties 
and damage because the landslides had cut off the affected area, said 
the report received in Cairo. Iran is periodically stricken by earthquakes, 
which often cause wide scale damage and loss of life.
