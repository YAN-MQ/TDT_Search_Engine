Six people are dead and many others injured following a clash between 
indonesian security forces and protesters. Student demonstrators were 
marching on parliament when police opened fire. Rubber bullets, water 
cannons and tear gas were used to subdue the rock-throwing students. 
Protesters were demonstrating against a special government assembly. 
Many students say they want more democratic change in government, 
no military involvement in politics and former President Suharto to 
be brought up on charges of human rights abuses.
