French President Jacques Chirac on Friday urged both Mexico and his 
own country to defend their own cultures against the onslaught of 
a global culture as he inaugurated a fair promoting French culture 
and education here. It was a reference to complaints by some intellectuals 
and officials in both countries that U.S. music, film and computer 
culture, together with the English language, threaten their own cultures. 
``By defending our cultures and managing to export them beyond our 
borders, we struggle against uniformity and standardization,'' Chirac 
said. ``In this way we avoid the cultural impoverishment of the world, 
which if we are not careful, could emerge as the hidden face of globalization.'' 
Chirac's second morning in the Mexican capital was devoted more to 
culture than to commerce _ though the visit takes place as Mexican 
and European negotiators are starting talks on a free trade pact. 
Opening a French cultural center in Mexico City on Thursday night, 
Chirac praised the host nation. ``Your country,'' he said,`` has managed 
to join the genius of the Mesoamerican and Latin civilizations with 
the most advanced technologies, achieving political and economic reforms 
that have impressed the world.''
