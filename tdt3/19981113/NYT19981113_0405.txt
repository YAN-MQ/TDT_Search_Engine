It should come as no surprise that investors out to shield themselves 
from the recent market volatility would dive into the stocks of drug 
makers. After all, people get sick regardless of market conditions. 
But what no one could have predicted was that some investors would 
pass up such comet stocks as Warner-Lambert, up 76.5 percent this 
year, and Schering-Plough, up 64 percent, for the likes of Johnson 
&AMP; Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb. But that's what they have 
been doing. On the day last month when Schering-Plough reported a 
22 percent gain in third-quarter earnings, its stock actually dropped 
1.9 percent, to $98.50. Bristol-Myers reported only a 13 percent gain 
the same day, and its shares increased 68.75 cents, to $105.6875. 
Johnson &AMP; Johnson was also defying gravity. Despite the company's 
report of an 11 percent gain in third-quarter earnings, one of the 
worst performances in the pharmaceutical industry, its shares are 
now at a record high of $84.625. Has the world gone mad? Hardly. Investors 
who fear an economic downturn are snapping up shares of Johnson &AMP; 
Johnson and Bristol-Myers, the drug industry's two most consistent 
players. Aside from producing steady earnings quarter after quarter, 
both are remarkably diversified and inexpensive compared with most 
of their competitors. ``Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
are strong growth stocks for the long term,'' said David Saks, a managing 
director of Gruntal &AMP; Co. who manages the company's four health 
care unit investment trusts. ``I've included both stocks in our funds 
because they deliver consistent earnings. And I'm like most investors: 
I don't like surprises.'' The two companies have been so predictable 
in their businesses over the years that some investors have dismissed 
them as dull. While other drug makers have rushed to become so-called 
life-sciences companies, with holdings in agribusiness, biotechnology 
and pharmaceuticals, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Bristol-Myers have 
refused to abandon an operating strategy that was popular in the 70s 
and 80s. Back then, drug companies loaded up on disparate businesses 
as a way to bolster revenues in case health maintenance organizations 
forced a cut in drug prices. Before the end of the 80s, American Home 
Products, for example, was selling not only Premarin, one of the world's 
top hormone replacement drugs, but also a variety of medical gadgets 
and Chef Boy-Ar-Dee spaghetti. In the last few years, however, most 
drug companies have shed their lower-profit-margin baggage; American 
Home sold 80 percent of its food division to Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; 
Furst. But Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Bristol-Myers have held fast 
to the strategy of diversification. Besides producing medical equipment 
and prescription drugs, Johnson &AMP; Johnson makes household-brand 
products like Tylenol and Band-Aid adhesive bandages, while Bristol-Myers 
peddles Herbal Essences shampoo and other Clairol hair-care products. 
The reasoning is that diversity can be a big help in cushioning earnings 
when the patents on popular drugs expire. These broad product mixes 
catch the eyes of conservative investors. ``With Bristol-Myers Squibb, 
it's steady as she goes,'' said Dr. Kris Jenner, an analyst with T. 
Rowe Price. He said the stock, which closed at $111.0625 on Friday, 
could hit $125 to $130 over the next 12 months. But neither of these 
two drug giants is a slouch on the pharmaceutical side. Thanks largely 
to Pravachol, a cholesterol-reducing agent, and Taxol, an anti-cancer 
drug, Bristol-Myers recorded $5.69 billion in United States pharmaceutical 
sales last year, the most for any company, according to IMS Health, 
a consulting firm. Johnson &AMP; Johnson finished a close second in 
that category, at $5.66 billion. The company should have three drugs 
this year with annual sales above $1 billion: Procrit, for anemia; 
Propulsid, the gastrointestinal agent, and Risperdal, an antipsychotic. 
Only Merck and Pfizer should have more billion-dollar sellers. (Saks 
said shares of Johnson &AMP; Johnson could hit $103 in 12 months, 
compared with $84.625 today.) To an aggressive investor, the 28.5 
percent gain in Johnson &AMP; Johnson stock this year and the 17.4 
percent increase for Bristol-Myers might seem a sorry performance, 
considering that the Standard &AMP; Poor's Drugs Index is up 38.4 
percent. Yet the stocks look attractive in other ways: Both have beaten 
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which is up 16 percent 
this year. And each has a price-to-earnings ratio near that of the 
overall market _ a rare characteristic among drug stocks. The average 
large drug stock has a P/E of 39, compared with 28.5 for the S&AMP;P 
500. Johnson &AMP; Johnson's ratio is 31.7, slightly lower than Bristol's 
31.3. That's a fire sale compared with Warner-Lambert's ratio of 52.2 
and Pfizer's 55.9. It is unlikely, meanwhile, that Johnson &AMP; Johnson 
or Bristol-Myers shareholders will toss and turn at night, as investors 
in Warner-Lambert might well have done last December, when the company's 
shares tumbled 18.5 percent in a single day. The selloff was prompted 
by Glaxo Wellcome's announcement that it was yanking Rezulin, a leading 
diabetes drug that Warner-Lambert sold in the United States, from 
the British market because of concerns about possible liver toxicity. 
Warner-Lambert's shares have more than recovered from the losses, 
but that's clearly the type of surprise that conservative shareholders 
can do without.
