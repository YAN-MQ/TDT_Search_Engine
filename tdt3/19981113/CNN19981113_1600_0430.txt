The Internal Revenue Service is beefing up its program that provides 
help for taxpayers with problems. The IRS established the program 
in 1977, but the agency's taxpayer advocates were hard to reach and 
had only limited authority. Now they can tell aggressive tax collectors 
to back off. The head of the IRS says the program assures taxpayers 
a way to get help. Many times, people have gotten one of our famous, 
or perhaps infamous, notices or letters that aren't always so easy 
to understand. They may say "you owe some money." So you can come 
in and get an explanation for that. If it turns out that you don't 
owe the money, that can be resolved. If it turns out you do owe some 
money and you can't pay it right away, there are a variety of things. 
We can work out a payment plan for you within the limits of what the 
law provides. And we find that, in most cases, we can work out something 
that taxpayers can live with. You can contact an IRS taxpayer advocate 
toll-free at -- the number will be printed in this year's tax return 
instruction booklet.
