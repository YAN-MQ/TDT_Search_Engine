That's "NBC nightly news" for this Friday. Don't forget "Dateline" 
at 8:00, 7:00 central. And updates throughout the night and the weekend 
on this NBC station on the situation in Iraq. And continuing coverage 
of the showdown with Saddam on MSNBC on cable all weekend. I'm Tom 
Brokaw. I'll see you back here Monday. If I don't see you well before 
then.
