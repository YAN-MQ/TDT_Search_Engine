Ukraine hopes to pay off its dlrs 1 billion gas debt to Russia by 
the end of the year with food, machines and other goods, a top industry 
official said Friday. Repayment of the mounting debt to Russia's gas 
monopoly Gazprom became possible ``thanks to Russia's willingness 
to meet Ukraine halfway,'' said Ihor Bakai, chairman of Ukraine's 
state oil and gas giant Naftogaz Ukrainy. Under a deal finalized earlier 
this month, Ukraine is to cover half the debt with supplies of food 
products, and the other half with farm machines and gas industry equipment. 
Although the two countries have often wrangled over Ukraine's gas 
debt in previous years, the latest debt repayment deal has allowed 
Ukraine and Gazprom to significantly improve relations, Bakai said. 
``We are now cooperating with Gazprom as partners that help each other,'' 
Bakai was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Gazprom is 
Russia's largest single taxpayer, and owes the cash-strapped government 
huge amounts of back taxes. The company says it cannot pay because 
former Soviet republics have failed to pay their debts to Gazprom. 
Last week, Ukraine and Russia reached a deal on 1999 gas supplies, 
under which Ukraine is to receive 40 billion cubic meters (1.4 trillion 
cubic feet) of gas as payment for transit of Russian gas through its 
territory to Western Europe. Ukraine, the world's sixth largest consumer 
of gas, needs about 80 billion cubic meters (2.8 trillion cubic feet) 
of gas annually, of which only 18 billion cubic meters (630 billion 
cubic feet) is domestically produced and the rest is imported, mostly 
from Russia.
