Now lets go to Baghdad and NBC's Ron Allen, where it is already early 
saturday morning. ron? Here in Baghdad, Saddam Hussein trying to save 
face, desperate to buy time. But today, his friends, the Russians, 
telling Saddam he's dangerously close to pushing his demand for a 
lifting of economic sanctions, too far. Tonight, government-controlled 
television news claiming the Russian ambassador's visit endorses Saddam's 
decision to cutoff U.N. weapons inspections. But viewers not being 
told the hand-carried letter from Boris Yeltsin, warns Saddam he's 
in serious trouble and must allow the inspectors back. Russian pressure 
convincing Saddam to hint at backing down, but Saddam still insisting 
the crisis cannot be resolved unless the U.N. economic sanctions cannot 
be lifted. On this Muslim day of prayer, Iraq continuing to offer 
the people hope. In sermons approved by the government, religious 
leaders telling worshipers their faith will protect them, but never 
mentioning much of the Arab world has turned its back on Iraq. In 
this hospital, now on emergency standby, doctors worry about a very 
practical concern -- how to help anyone wounded by what looks like 
an imminent attack. We will try to do what we can, but as a doctor 
working at this hospital, I believe it will be tragic for us. He has 
just six empty beds, hardly any blood, and barely any medicine. Here 
in Iraq, Saddam's Gamble putting his people in ever-increasing danger. 
And he's still telling his people there's worldwide condemnation of 
america's threats. tom? Thanks very much, Ron Allen tonight in Baghdad.
