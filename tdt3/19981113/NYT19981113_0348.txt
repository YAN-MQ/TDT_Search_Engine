Colin Davis, in his first series of concerts as principal guest conductor 
of the New York Philharmonic, has assembled an offbeat program of 
works more or less familiar from recordings but seldom heard in concert. 
And for the most part, he did a fine job with it on Thursday evening. 
But the show, varied as it was, was stolen, in the best sense of the 
term, by Thomas Quasthoff, a German baritone making his debut with 
the orchestra in songs by Mahler to texts from ``Des Knaben Wunderhorn.'' 
Quasthoff, heard to adequate effect two years ago in a performance 
of Bach's ``St. John Passion'' with the Philadelphia Orchestra, seemed 
ideal for this music. His rotund bass-baritone belies his tiny stature, 
which was shaped by his mother's use of the drug thalidomide during 
pregnancy, and it occasionally takes on a grainy edge that suits the 
folkish nature of these songs. Quasthoff's oversize personality, given 
ample scope here in material ranging from the farcical (the donkey's 
``Ija'' in ``Praise From an Advanced Intellect'') to the forlorn, 
persuaded a listener to forget, for the moment, those great performances 
available on records. The same cannot be said for the work of his 
partner here, Inger Dam-Jensen, a Danish soprano, also in her Philharmonic 
debut. Ms. Dam-Jensen sang honorably _ indeed, very well _ and with 
an attractive tone but did not connect with the texts in a specific 
enough fashion to rid the brain of a yearning for familiar presences 
in this music: the fragility and suppleness of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, 
the warmth, depth and plushness of Christa Ludwig. The orchestra showed 
its Mahlerian stripes beautifully in Davis' practiced hands, though 
an occasional tempo had yet to settle in. The strings were especially 
appealing, and the cellos applied a delightfully schmaltzy touch to 
``Rhine Legend.'' Frank Martin's ``Petite Symphonie Concertante'' 
afforded a quirky but attractive showcase for several orchestra members: 
Nancy Allen, the guest principal harpist; Lionel Party, the harpsichordist, 
and Harriet Wingreen, a pianist. Berlioz's ``Roi Lear'' Overture filled 
out the program but did little more. The work has always struck this 
Berlioz fan as a potboiler, and even as ardent a champion of the composer 
as Davis was not able to make it seem more than that. The program 
is to be repeated Saturday evening at Avery Fisher Hall. Even sated 
fans of Mahler, let alone perennially starved fans of Martin, should 
not miss it.
