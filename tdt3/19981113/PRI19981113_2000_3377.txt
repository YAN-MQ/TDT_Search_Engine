Music from French rapper Stoney Bugsy there. Our own theme music was 
composed by Eric Goldberg. We're online 24 hours a day at www.theworld.org, 
and you can join us there until Monday. In Boston, I'm Tony Kahn. 
Have a great weekend. The World is a co-production of the BBC World 
Service, Public Radio International and WGBH in Boston and is made 
possible in part by the PRI Program Fund, whose contributors include 
the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, 
and the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund, helping people to make 
the arts a part of their everyday lives.
