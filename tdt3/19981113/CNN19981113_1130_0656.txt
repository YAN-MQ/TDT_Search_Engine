top stories are next. then we'll check in on the markets in "dollars 
& sense." and later -- a prince at 50. we'll examine the public and 
private man. first, this edition of "your health." hypothermia doesn't 
just occur during the cold winter months. if you're among a certain 
high-risk group, you could develop the life-threatening condition 
in temperatures as high as 60 degrees. infants and elderly people 
are most susceptible, as are people with diabetes, heart disease or 
those who abuse alcohol. but anyone exposed to cold weather for a 
prolonged period of time can develop hypothermia. the condition sets 
in when the core body temperature falls below 96 degrees. symptoms 
include dizziness, drowsiness, pale skin and shivering. in the later 
stages of hypothermia, the shivering stops, leading to a false and 
dangerous sense of well-being that can precede death. the best way 
to avoid hypothermia is to stay warm and dry, make sure your head 
is covered and try to keep moving. if you suspect someone is suffering 
from hypothermia, wrap them in warm clothing while you wait for medical 
treatment. for the latest health news online, check out cnn.com/health.
