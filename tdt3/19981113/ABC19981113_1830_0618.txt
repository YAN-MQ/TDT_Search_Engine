In Chicago today, a group of survivirs and their supporters came out 
very publicaly for judicial reform that may very well mean the exact 
difference between life and death. They are all meeting at northwestern 
University law school. The survivors have all beaten the death penalty 
in the United States. In some cases, just. ABC's Terry Moran is there. 
Illinois farmer Gary gauger is the justice system's worst nightmare, 
a dead man talking. People don't want to believe it. I can see why. 
It's scary. It's a scary thing. In 1993, gauger was sentenced to die 
by lethal injection for the savage slaying of his mother and father. 
The key evidence against him, his own words, during a grueling 18-hour 
interrogation, police claimed to have ironclad evidence against him. 
Gauger confessed. I believed at that point I had done it. I just started 
crying and then I quit. But gauger hadn't done it. Three years after 
being sentenced to die, gauger was set free when a court threw out 
his confession and authorities charged two other men with the murder 
of his parents. Gary gauger is one of 75 people who have been sentenced 
to die, and later found innocent and freed in the past 25 years. That's 
one innocent person out of every seven who have been put to death 
in that time. With death row populations rising to all time highs, 
the organizers of this conference say the risk of a mistake is inevitably 
on the rise, too. What we are trying to do is show these faces to 
all of America, so that we can have some balance. So that we can understand 
that in reality we need to be very cognizant of the fact that we can 
execute innocent people. Skeptics say the conference exaggerates the 
problem. It's just a P.R. game. It's an argument about statistics. 
Like I said, they can't point to a single case of an innocent person 
being put to death. Advocates respond that innocents have been executed, 
but can't prove it because the system stops investigating cases after 
execution. Meanwhile, Gary gauger works his farm, a walking testament 
to the death penalty's darkest danger. Terry Moran, ABC News, Chicago.
