About 500 banana workers will lose their jobs and another 2,000 will 
face pay cuts in a massive reorganization of the industry, exporters 
and trade unions announced Friday. Marshall Hall, chairman of Producers 
Group, Ltd. and three banana plantations, said the restructuring is 
necessary to make Jamaican bananas competitive in the world markets. 
``We have to take a decision to make the industry viable and it will 
also mean that workers will have to take lower wages,'' said Hall. 
All 2,500 workers at the three plantations will be laid off, according 
to a joint statement issued by Producers Group and the three trade 
unions representing the workers. Of those laid off, 2,000 will be 
re-hired by a newly formed company under different terms and lower 
wages. The issue of European countries paying preferential prices 
for bananas from their former colonies in the Caribbean has led the 
United States to threaten further free-trade complaints. Despite preferences, 
Jamaica has not been able to fulfill its quota of banana exports to 
Europe for several years.
