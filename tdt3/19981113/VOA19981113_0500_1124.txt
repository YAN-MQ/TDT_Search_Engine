Joe Torrie, who led baseball's New York Yankees to an American League 
record, 114 victories in 1998 has been honored as American League 
Manager of the Year. Torrie also guided the Yankees to their second 
World Series Championship in Three Years. But the voting was conducted 
prior to post-season play, Torrie credits his honor to the strong 
performance to his team. What makes me a good manager is pretty good 
players. I mean you can't win the Derby on a quarterhorse, and you 
know we have quality here. And quality with a lot of heart. The 50 
year-old Torrie was the only manager named on all 28 ballots in voting 
by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Torrie also received 
the award in 1996, when he shared the honor with Johnny Oats of the 
Texas Rangers. Jimmy Williams of the Boston Red Socks, was a distant 
runner-up, while Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins finished third 
in the voting. Houston Astros manager Larry Dirker was named the National 
League Manager of the Year on Wednesday.
