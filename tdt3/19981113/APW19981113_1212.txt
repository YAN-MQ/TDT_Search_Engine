Red dots scattered across the map on Margarita Clark's wall show villages 
still not heard from two weeks after Hurricane Mitch rampaged across 
Nicaragua and other parts of Central America. ``I believe that they 
have food,'' said the Save the Children charity worker. ``I am worried 
that they have been drinking contaminated water and we'll have outbreaks 
of disease.'' Even with massive reconstruction efforts under way following 
storms that killed about 10,000 people in four countries, the full 
scale of devastation remains unclear: Hundreds of villages remain 
unaccounted for. Even in the best of times, it could take a horse 
or ox to reach many settlements in the dirt-poor countryside of Honduras 
and Nicaragua. Now, with major highways and many phone lines cut, 
there has been no way to reach those tiny settlements at all. ``It 
has not been possible to send aid to more than 300 small, remote communities 
which remain incommunicado,'' said Col. Guillermo Pinel, president 
of the National Emergency Committee. ``The government is making efforts 
to rehabilitate the roads, the bridges, the telephones and the drinking 
water systems in many places, but it lacks resources enough to carry 
out urgent work.'' Pinel said Honduras' own 14 military helicopters 
had been supplemented by 16 from Mexico and 12 from the United States. 
But they were not sufficient to both ferry aid and survey damage in 
a country whose road system was almost destroyed and where 10,000 
people remain missing in addition to almost 7,000 known dead. Clark 
said nothing had yet been heard from about 10 percent of the 148 villages 
the organization serves in two northwestern provinces of Nicaragua. 
``The access roads are still very full of mud and one village, Versailles, 
is surrounded by the mudslide'' from the Casitas Volcano, which collapsed 
during the storm, overwhelming several villages and killing hundreds 
of people. Nicaragua has confirmed almost 2,000 dead, with hundreds 
more missing. Several hundred people also died in Guatemala and El 
Salvador. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Leon, Bosco Vivas Robelo, appealed 
Thursday night for people to come forward if they were aware of any 
towns still isolated. ``After 15 days, practically since the hurricane, 
they think of themselves as abandoned brothers,'' the bishop told 
a news conference. ``Yes, we are very worried.'' Honduras announced 
Friday that it had received dlrs 67 million worth of aid from 20 nations 
_ though President Carlos Flores Facusse said Thursday that the cost 
of rebuilding could top dlrs 4 billion. Two or three aid flights were 
arriving each hour, and one or two ships with supplies each day. Among 
those arriving to survey damage on Friday was Spanish Crown Prince 
Felipe de Borbon, who met with Flores shortly after arriving. He flew 
by helicopter to survey several areas damaged by Mitch in its Oct. 
25-Nov. 2 passage through Honduras. Honduran officials say the storm 
destroyed about 60 percent of their road and utility network and about 
70 percent of their agriculture.
