The White House is dismissing comments made by Iraqi President Saddam 
hussein to try and settle the latest showdown over U.N. weapons inspections. 
Hussein says his restrictions on U.N. inspectors were intended to 
get a Response to Iraq's legal demands. He says Iraq is "willing to 
accept positively any initiative" that would lead to the lifting of 
economic sanctions against his country. White House press secretary 
Joe Lockhart says there's nothing new in the remarks. At a White House 
ceremony today, President Clinton says Hussein holds the key to avoiding 
a military showdown only if he resumes cooperation with u.N. weapons 
inspections. Iraq's continued refusal to embrace a diplomatic, peaceful 
solution, its continued defiance of even more United Nations resolutions, 
makes it plainer than ever that its real goal is to end the sanctions 
without giving up its weapons of mass destruction program. The security 
council and the world have made it Crystal clear, now, that this is 
unacceptable, that none of us can tolerate an Iraq free to develop 
weapons of mass destruction with impunity.
