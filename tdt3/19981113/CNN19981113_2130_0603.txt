Seven people are dead and many are injured after a clash between Indonesian 
security forces and protesters. Student demonstrators were marching 
on parliament when police unleashed rubber bullets and tear gas to 
subdue the rock-throwing students. Protesters were demonstrating a 
special government assembly. Many students say they want more democratic 
change in government, no military involvement in politics and former 
President Suharto to be brought up on charges of human rights abuses.
