I'm David Chadwick, VOA News. The American military buildup in the 
Persian Gulf region continues as tension mounts on the latest standoff 
with Iraq over United Nations' weapons inspections. Dozens of warplanes 
are on their way as is another US aircraft carrier battle group. US 
Defense Secretary William Cohen warned, Thursday, that any US military 
action against Iraq would be significant. He joined a chorus of American 
officials in saying the only way out of the crisis is for Iraq to 
comply with UN resolutions. Among them was state department spokesman, 
James Rubin. This is a grave situation. And instead of responding 
to the appeals from all over the world, from the Arab world, from 
Europe, from Asia, Iraq is still trying to play, pass the responsibility, 
instead of taking responsibility for its failure to cooperate and 
its flouting of Security Council resolutions. Meanwhile, Iraq is blaming 
President Clinton and the United States government for the crisis. 
Iraq Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Azis said, Washington refuses to 
acknowledge Baghdad has complied with UN resolutions. If he is ready 
to change course. If he is ready to read the Security Council's resolutions 
legally and fairly. If he is ready, he himself and his government, 
to respect those resolutions, to respect resolution 687, yes, then 
there will be no problem, because he and his government are the problem, 
not Iraq. Mr. Azis said international sanctions have been as devastating 
to Iraq as US bombs would be. And he said that the threat of US led 
airstrikes makes no difference to the Iraqi people. Meanwhile six 
Arab Gulf states, along with Syria and Egypt have called on Iraq to 
honor United Nations' weapons resolutions to avoid a confrontation 
that they say will hurt only Iraqi civilians.
