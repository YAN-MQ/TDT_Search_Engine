Overseas tonight, there is every sign that Indonesia is on the verge 
of civil war. Many thousands of students have been involved in a bloody 
confrontation with police that's lasted all week. The students helped 
to bring down Suharto in may. Now they want further change. Here's 
ABC's Bill Blakemore. Djakarta's business center was a war zone tonight. 
At times there was hand to hand combat. There were volleys of rubber 
bullets, which can kill at close range and did. This man is pleading 
with soldiers to stop just long enough to carry away those who have 
been hurt. Demonstrators say the government has still not changed 
since they forced the dictator Suharto from power last may. Parliament 
today did agree to investigate Suharto and his family and to hold 
new elections. But as evening fell, word came that parliament had 
also voted to guarantee the military its usual seats in the assembly 
and that raised emotions on both sides. Bill Blakemore, ABC News. 
a big country going from bad to worse.
