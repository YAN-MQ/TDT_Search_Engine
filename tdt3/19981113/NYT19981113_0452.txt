The deal has not been announced yet, but already there is no shortage 
of competing proposals for spending New York's $20 billion share of 
a reported $206 billion tobacco settlement: things like health care 
for the uninsured, stop-smoking programs and a cut in property taxes. 
For more than a year, since the first, ill-fated multistate tobacco 
settlement was announced, interest groups and elected officials here 
have been making plans for the money, which would be paid over 25 
years. On Friday, with word that a settlement would be made final 
on Saturday and announced on Monday, the lobbying began anew. In his 
successful campaign to unseat Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, Rep. Charles Schumer 
said New York's share of any settlement should be used to reduce property 
taxes, an idea that has not caught on with state lawmakers. The most 
important player in deciding how the money would be spent, Gov. George 
Pataki, has not indicated his views. State Assembly Speaker Sheldon 
Silver ``would want to see a major effort to limit smoking by youngsters, 
and to see some of it go to a pool for people without health insurance, 
and maybe some for school infrastructure,'' his spokeswoman, Pat Lynch, 
said Friday. Some of the state's business groups would probably push 
for using some of the money to reduce employers' health insurance 
premiums, officials of those groups said. Premiums now include more 
than $2 billion a year in surcharges to support hospital care for 
the uninsured and graduate medical education, expenses that the officials 
said could be paid partly with tobacco money. A coalition that includes 
the New York Medical Society, the New York Public Interest Research 
Group and the state chapters of the American Cancer Society, the American 
Lung Association and the League of Women Voters held a news conference 
here Friday to ask that $2.4 billion go into programs that help people 
stop smoking and discourage young people from starting. ``We think 
that all of the money should be funneled back into the health-care 
system and into ways to keep kids from smoking,'' said Blair Horner, 
legislative director of the Public Interest Research Group. ``We don't 
want to see it going into roads and bridges and other unrelated things.'' 
Several state legislators said they expected the number of proposals 
for using the money to grow in the next few weeks. ``This is going 
to be pretty much a feeding frenzy,'' said one legislator who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity. ``I mean, it's free money.'' The agreement 
would not restrict the states' use of the money, said aides to Attorney 
General Dennis Vacco, who was involved in the negotiations with tobacco 
companies. But they said it was back-loaded, so that the annual payments 
would start relatively small and grow during the 25-year span of the 
settlement. Vacco, a Republican, has changed from a reluctant and 
late entrant into the litigation to a major participant. For a year 
he resisted calls from Democrats and health-care advocates to join 
other states in suing the tobacco industry, and he did so in January 
1997 only after 18 other states had. At the time, he said he had offered 
the tobacco companies a $656 million settlement, a tiny fraction of 
what New York now stands to gain. Democrats attacked Vacco's handling 
of the issue during his recent re-election campaign. The Nov. 3 election 
was so close that it is still unclear whether he won a second term 
or lost to his Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer.
