And when we come back -- NBC news "in depth" -- a giant storm of meteors 
in space. Why U.S. military planners are worried. A good night's sleep 
for your skin in a jar. Is it just a dream, or something you can wake 
up to? Here's how women our age can achieve this revitalized look. 
Nine out of ten of us who tested this night cream... found its intense 
moisture-- pro-retinol plus vitamins-- left skin feeling smooth, moisturized, 
revitalized. Provital gives skin bounce-back resilience, so you wake 
to a truly uplifting morning. And the name? Provital night cream from 
oil of Olay. Proven to help you look revitalized. The truck. The award. 
The new Chevy Silverado. The motor trend truck of the year. It's bigger. 
It's more powerful. It's the truck. From Chevrolet. Like a rock, oh... 
like a rock.
