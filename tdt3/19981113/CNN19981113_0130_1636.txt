Consider this the unofficial beginning of the holiday season. The 
Rockefeller center Christmas tree was hoisted into position in New 
York on Thursday. The 73-foot Norway spruce is no stranger to the 
holiday. It was the Christmas tree for a family in suburban Cleveland 
back in 1938. The family planted it in their yard after the holidays 
and donated it this year. The fully decorated Rockefeller center Christmas 
tree will be unveiled december 2nd.
