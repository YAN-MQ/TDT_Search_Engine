turmoil on the world's financial markets. The IMF has unveiled a rescue 
package worth more than $40 billion. IMF head Michel Camdessus. The 
way is now open for the international community to provide financial 
support to Brazil that will enhance market confidence in the government's 
economic policies and help ensure the success of the country's program. 
President Clinton has welcomed the loans package and Brazil's efforts 
to cut down on spending. He says the measures are essential in the 
battle against the world's economic crisis.
