It doesn't get much closer. Now, how close will the U.S. be watching 
Iraq nor violations after the attack that never came? Also tonight 
the view from on deck. This ship was forced to stay silent instead. 
What to expect when Ken Starr starts off the impeachment hearing. 
And what tomorrow morning's "New York Times" is reporting about the 
president's chief accuser. How much is the deal worth to write her 
story down and sell it? Good Monday evening to you. In just a moment, 
we will talk to man identified by this morning's "Washington Post" 
as the one who convinced the president not to attack iraq. This past 
weekend, according to published reports, 0,000 Iraqis came very close 
to dying. That was the casualty figure, 10,000. But the administration 
was using in its planning for this in the hours leading up to what 
became the nonattack. The order was given, then 30 minutes before 
the first cruise missile streaks across the Persian gulf, it was halted. 
What would it take by way of Iraqi behavior to launch the attack? 
Also tonight we'll preview the star witness on the hill, with two 
R's, look at the news being made by the big three news weekly magazines 
and the tuesday morning papers high.
