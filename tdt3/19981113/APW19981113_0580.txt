Russia's security chief said Friday that a criminal case was opened 
against a Communist lawmaker for calling for the government's ouster, 
and urged a separate probe into his anti-Semitic remarks. But prosecutors 
denied that they had opened a case against Albert Makashov, a retired 
general who has ignited controversy by blaming the country's problems 
on ``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur against Jews. Russian law forbids 
speeches that ``incite ethnic strife.'' Vladimir Putin, the chief 
of Russia's Federal Security Service, said on Friday that Moscow city 
prosecutors had officially launched a probe against Makashov, the 
Interfax news agency reported. But prosecutors said that a month ago 
they only started a general investigation into the calls for the government's 
ouster made by several politicians at public rallies, but hasn't launched 
a probe specifically against Makashov. Putin said the FSB would urge 
prosecutors to bring separate charges against Makashov for his anti-Semitic 
statements and request that parliament's lower house, the State Duma, 
waive the immunity he enjoys as a lawmaker. Prosecutors said they 
were still checking whether Makashov made any remarks punishable by 
law. President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday criticized prosecutors and 
other law-enforcement officials for their ``indecision'' in combating 
political and ethnic extremism. He didn't specifically refer to Makashov's 
case. Communists, who dominate the Duma together with their hardline 
allies, last week blocked a resolution condemning Makashov. They could 
also block any attempt to lift his immunity. Meanwhile, the Duma on 
Friday debated a vague measure that criticizes unspecified lawmakers 
for ``inciting ethnic tension.'' The measure doesn't contain any specific 
reference to Makashov or anti-Semitism. ``This statement is a camouflage, 
it's simply an attempt to shrug off the protests,'' said Iosif Kobzon, 
a popular singer who is also a member of the Duma. ``I face anti-Semitic 
attacks myself every day I enter the State Duma building,'' he said. 
Some Communist officials defended Makashov in speeches last weekend 
celebrating the 81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution, which 
brought the Communist Party to power. Makashov's statements and the 
Communist refusal to censure him have sparked protests in Russia and 
abroad. Israel's ambassador to Russia said Thursday that Makashov's 
attacks were an insult to the entire Israeli nation. Communist Party 
leader Gennady Zyuganov, who had been only mildly critical of Makashov 
in recent days, made a more direct denunciation on Thursday. ``We 
consider Makashov's statements inappropriate, unrestrained and incorrect,'' 
Zyuganov said. But Yelena Mizulina, a member of the liberal Yabloko 
faction urged the entire house to openly condemn Makashov. ``Makashov's 
words reflect the opinion of his party comrades,'' she said.
