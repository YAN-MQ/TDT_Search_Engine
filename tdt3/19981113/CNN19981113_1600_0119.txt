Pentagon officials say they are ready to launch a military strike 
against iraq if President Clinton gives the order. But it could be 
a week before U.S. forces are in place in the Persian gulf. Military 
aircraft, including 12 B-52 bombers, are leaving the U.S. today for 
positions near the gulf. In FT. Stewart, Georgia, 3,000 troops are 
preparing to go to Kuwait to join the 1,000 troops there. Commanders 
say those soldiers could be ready to go within 72 hours of orders. 
My heart goes out to the families and the great support they provide. 
And I know there is always a great deal of concern when the soldiers 
are deploying. I would just simply say this division has done a great 
job of taking care of families. They will continue to do a great job 
taking care of families left behind. But a word of thanks to the families 
that have always supported us in so many ways.
