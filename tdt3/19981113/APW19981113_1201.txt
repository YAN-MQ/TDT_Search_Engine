In his first statement since the start of the dispute over U.N. weapons 
inspections, President Saddam Hussein said Friday he was not trying 
to create a crisis and would accept ``positively any initiative'' 
that would lift U.N. sanctions. But U.S. President Clinton declared 
the standoff would end only with a decision by Iraq to resume its 
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which 
is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. ``Saddam 
Hussein has it within his hands to end this crisis now by resuming 
full cooperation with UNSCOM,'' Clinton said. His warning came shortly 
after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Iraq to ``reverse 
course or face the consequences.'' The statements suggested that both 
sides were no closer to a compromise that would avert a threatened 
U.S. attack on Iraq. They mirrored past declarations made since the 
crisis began in August _ and offered little room for compromise. In 
Baghdad, there were widening fears that a U.S. military strike was 
imminent. Queues of hundreds formed at gas stations and shoppers found 
some prices up in Baghdad's crowded markets Friday. ``Of course we 
are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, selling vegetables in downtown 
Baghdad. ``But it's not about any kind of aggression. We are all having 
trouble getting enough money to buy food.'' Still, the mood seemed 
defiant, reflecting the government's efforts to forge a united front 
against the U.N. sanctions, which were imposed eight years ago after 
it invaded Kuwait. ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' 
said Naima Aidan, 40, as she shopped for sugar and coconut to make 
sweets for her four children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us 
safe.'' Preachers at Friday prayers in the nation's mosques called 
on Arabs and Muslims to rally behind Iraq, despite signs of a loss 
of support in its confrontation over the inspections. ``I call upon 
you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to declare war on America 
and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim, sheik of the Abdel-Khader 
al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad. ``Do not let their airplanes 
use your airspace or bases.'' No information was available in Baghdad 
about military preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party 
said in a statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved 
north to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major highways. 
A second dissident group, the London-based Iraqi Broadcasting Corp., 
said brigades of the elite Republican Guards have been dispersed around 
Baghdad and in provinces further north. It also said the government 
had ordered several intelligence and security departments, such as 
Military Intelligence and the Special Security Organization, to move 
to the outskirts of the capital. ``All their offices are empty now,'' 
the group said in a fax sent to Cairo. Saddam's statement ... pickup
