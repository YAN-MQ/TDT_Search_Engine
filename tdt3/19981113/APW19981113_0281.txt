Germany's highest court refused Friday to block Bavaria's attempts 
to deport to Turkey a 14-year-old Turkish juvenile delinquent born 
and raised in Germany. The Constitutional Court ruled unanimously 
that arguments filed by the boy, known as ``Mehmet,'' that his rights 
were being violated were inadmissable, thus closing his case. But 
it was not immediately clear when or if he could be deported, since 
his parents have had his passport invalidated by Turkish officials. 
The Mehmet case made headlines this summer when Bavarian officials 
sought to deport not only the boy, who was born and raised in Munich, 
but also his parents, who have lived and worked in Germany for 30 
years. Although the parents had never been in trouble with the law, 
they were accused of endangering public safety by failing to raise 
their son properly. Courts have blocked the deportation of the parents. 
But the entire case became an election-year issue, with liberals accusing 
the ruling conservatives of using a family tragedy to score points 
with voters who blame foreigners for rising crime. Bavaria's highest 
court last month upheld the state's decision to deny Mehmet a new 
residency permit because of a string of violent offenses, thus clearing 
the way for a deportation. But his lawyer had appealed to the Constitutional 
Court. In the meantime, his parents have had Mehmet's Turkish passport 
declared void and refuse to grant permission for a new one to be issued. 
Without valid travel documents, the boy can not be deported. Bavarian 
officials have asked the Foreign Ministry to take the issue up with 
Turkish officials in Ankara, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin 
Erdmann said last month that his office would not do so until all 
legal avenues in Germany are exhausted. Although a passport for a 
minor can not be issued without the parents' consent, Bavarian officials 
could ask a German court to force the boy's parents to comply.
