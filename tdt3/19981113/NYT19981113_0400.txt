The United States imposed trade restrictions on more than 300 Indian 
and Pakistani government agencies and private companies Friday as 
a result of the two countries' nuclear tests last May, Commerce Department 
officials said. The sanctions affect Indian and Pakistani companies 
believed to be involved in nuclear, missile and military programs. 
They will, in most cases, bar U.S. companies from trading with them. 
Commerce Department licenses will be required for any U.S. company 
wishing to export goods to the companies, and most of those licenses 
will be denied, officials said. The White House announced last week 
that President Clinton would lift most of the sanctions that were 
imposed after the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. This would 
allow U.S. loans, investments and some joint military training to 
resume. It would also revive U.S. support for an International Monetary 
Fund bailout for Pakistan.
