Fearing U.S. air strikes, thousands of Iraqis queued up outside gasoline 
stations Friday as Iraq's official media ignored the evident loss 
of Arab support in its confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections. 
Official newspapers published articles hailing President Saddam Hussein's 
decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, 
and claimed there was worldwide condemnation of American threats. 
The United States has beefed up its military strength in the Gulf 
and is threatening to launch air strikes in a bid to force Iraq to 
allow inspections by the Special Commission, which is responsible 
for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. ``The world calls 
for dialogue and peace and America seeks war and aggression,'' the 
official al-Iraq newspaper said. ``There is condemnation of American 
threats on both Arab and international levels,'' al-Thawra, the mouthpiece 
of the ruling Baath party newspaper, said in a banner headline. The 
newspapers made no mention of the warning issued to Iraq Thursday 
by six Gulf Arab countries _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _along with 
Syria and Egypt. They called for ``wisdom and reason'' to end the 
confrontation but said Saddam's government alone would be ``responsible 
for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of U.N. weapons 
inspectors. The criticism was unusually strong for Arab countries 
who have repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. 
At a news conference Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said 
if the Arab countries are sincere about resolving the crisis, ``they 
should blame the main block ... the United States.'' Hours later, 
Iraqi newspapers Friday claimed Iraq was capable of defeating the 
United States. At a Friday prayer sermon, a preacher urged Arabs and 
Muslis to ``declare war on America'' and rally behind Iraq. Friday 
sermons are usually screened by the goverment. ``I call upon you ... 
do not let their aeroplanes use your airspace or bases. do not give 
them any facilities,'' said the preacher, Abdullatif Humeim. The feeling 
of an imminent strike was evident from the rush to fill up gasoline. 
At one station, about 20 cars were queued up in front of each of its 
eight pumps. Iraqi officials escorting journalists said it was forbidden 
to take pictures or talk to the people at the gas staiton. A customer 
contacted later said he waited a half-hour to fill up his car. ``I 
fear the Americans will hit refineries and there will be a shortage 
of fuel,'' said the driver who did not wish to be identified. Markets 
in Baghdad were crammed, but the crowd comprised the usual weekend 
shoppers. At the Al-Shorja market, 40-year-old Naima Aidan said she 
was buying coconut and sugar to make sweets for her four children. 
``I am not worried. I don't think anything will happen to us. Because 
God will keep us safe,'' she said. Since Wednesday, the United Nations 
has pulled out of Iraq all its weapons inspectors and one-third of 
the 450 people working on the humanitarian programs. UNSCOM chief 
Richard Butler called it ``a very serious confrontation'' and said 
diplomatic solutions seem remote. ``There's a growing sense that air 
strikes or enforcement is becoming more and more likely,'' he told 
MSNBC television on Thursday night. Iraq says it is will cooperate 
with arms inspectors only if the U.N. Security Council guarantees 
that it will work to lift economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil sales 
and have ruined its economy, cannot be lifted until the inspectors 
certify that Iraq has destroyed its lethal weapons. This was required 
under the cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War. Aziz 
has said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``the best person'' 
to try to ease the current crisis. But Annan said Thursday he has 
no plans to visit Baghdad as he did the last time in February and 
resolved a previous crisis.
