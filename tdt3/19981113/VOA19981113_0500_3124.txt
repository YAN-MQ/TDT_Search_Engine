After 73 years as an independent auto maker, Chrysler has faded into 
history. Its merger with Germany's Daimler -Benz became official. 
Chrysler shares seized trading on the New York Stock Exchange under 
its familiar ticker symbol at the close of business on Thursday. The 
New company is called Daimler - Chrysler, and it will be headquartered 
in Germany. The departing Chrysler corporation leaves behind a Detroit, 
General Motors and Ford. Somehow the original big-three automakers 
are now the big- two. That's a look at business news, I'm Paul Westpheling 
in Washington.
