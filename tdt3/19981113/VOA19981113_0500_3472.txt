And we have this development in Science news on the week. A US biotechnology 
company says it has made a human cell, revert to the primordial state 
from which all other cells develop by fusing it with a cell from a 
cow, a cow's egg. Advanced Cell Technology of Westchester, Massachusetts 
says its research could eventually be used to grow replacement body 
tissues of any kind from a patient's cells. The company says it created 
the hybrid cells by removing the nucleus of a cow egg, and inserting 
a human cell nucleus. Only a small amount of the cow's genetic material 
remained. Now this research is not published or confirmed yet. But 
it is certain to raise a lot of ethical and moral questions about 
creating a cell that is part human and part cow.
