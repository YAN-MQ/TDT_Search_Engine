The stock market finished mixed Friday as investors awaited the meeting 
of the Federal Reserve policy-makers Tuesday to see whether the central 
bank would cut its target for short-term interest rates for the third 
time since September. Many analysts still expect a cut but the subsiding 
of the financial crisis since the last reduction in October, the continued 
buoyancy of the U.S. economy and the deal reached Thursday for international 
assistance for Brazil may make Fed officials decide to wait until 
their next meeting in December. ``We think the stock market has priced 
in a Fed rate cut,'' said Christine Callies, chief investment strategist 
at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``If it cuts, then the market might 
bounce up for a few days. But if it doesn't, we think the market will 
have an erratic consolidation'' that will see it trend lower. On Friday, 
technology and smaller-company stocks faltered while the Dow Jones 
industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks 
moved higher. Even with the rallies, the major indexes finished the 
week lower after a four-week surge in which they all jumped 13 percent 
or more. The Dow rose 89.85 points, to 8,919.59, while the SP climbed 
8.03 points, to 1,125.72. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 3.07 
points, to 1,847.99, and the Russell index of smaller-company stocks 
dropped 2.84 points, to 389.36. In the bond market, the price of the 
30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32, to 100 4/32. The bond's yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.24 percent, 
from 5.25 percent on Thursday. But while inaction by the Fed might 
unsettle the market, Ms. Callies said the central bank was no longer 
the main driver of investors. ``The market is rallying because it 
is celebrating the absence of disaster,'' she said. ``It had thought 
the world was going to end.'' This week's mania for Internet stocks 
continued, with another company soaring after its initial public offering. 
Friday it was shares of Theglobe.com, which offers free home pages 
on the World Wide Web. It went public Thursday at 9 a share and then 
soared 54 1/2 Friday, to close at 63 1/2, in the best first-day trading 
performance of any stock. Earlier this week, Earthweb also made a 
debut to a rousing demand from investors, rising 55 1/4, to 69 1/4, 
in two days of trading. Friday it fell 2 1/4, to 67. Ebay is another 
Internet offering that has recently soared. ``I think, given what 
has happened in Ebay and Earthweb, that the after-market demand from 
retail investors is extraordinary,'' said Henry Blodget, an Internet 
analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. The stocks ``are being played, not 
invested in.'' The retail sales data released Friday would not support 
another Fed easing, analysts said, because the figures showed that 
the economy was healthy and, especially, that consumer spending was 
strong. October retail sales rose 1 percent after an increase of three-tenths 
of 1 percent in September. The Producer Price Index rose two-tenths 
of 1 percent in October. But for the year, the index is down five-tenths 
of 1 percent, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. That performance 
does make it possible for the Fed to cut rates without worrying much 
about inflationary consequences. Several analysts acknowledged that 
the outlook for the world economy and financial markets was far better 
than it was on Oct. 15, when the Fed surprised investors with a rate 
cut in between its regular policy-making meetings. But Richard Berner, 
chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said he still expected 
the Fed to cut its target for short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage 
point. ``The capital crunch has substantially abated, but it is not 
over,'' he said. And, he added, the future risks for the economy ``are 
still tilted downward,'' and he expected that most Fed policy-makers 
would want to buy some more insurance by cutting rates again.
