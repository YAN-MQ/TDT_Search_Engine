A twin-engine sports plane carrying a pilot and two passengers crashed 
into a barn near Leer Friday and exploded in flames, killing all three 
on board, police said. The 61-year-old pilot who was flying from Bonn 
to the island of Juist in the North Sea, was forced to turn around 
because of bad weather and had returned to Leer, about 80 kilometers 
west of Bremen, according to police. Approaching Leer the plane struck 
a radio tower before the aircraft owned by the ``Travel Air'' company 
plunged through the roof a barn near the airport and burst into flames, 
police said. The names of the victims were not immediately released. 
An investigation into the cause of the accident continues.
