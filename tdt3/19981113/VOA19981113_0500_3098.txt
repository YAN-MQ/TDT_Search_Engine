Here in the United States, the Dow Jones, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average closed at 8829, up nearly 6 points, Thursday, with the broad-based 
Standard and Poors 500 Index closed down 3 points at 1117. Traders 
say there has not been much enthusiasm on Wall Street lately. Maybe 
the market gets nervous as it approaches the 9000 mark. In any case, 
some analysts believe shares are still overvalued. And further corrections 
are coming.
