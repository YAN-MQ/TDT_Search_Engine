Two Yugoslav soldiers were killed Friday in a new outbreak of violence, 
further fueling tensions in the strife-torn Kosovo province. Duncan 
Bullivant, an international official, said according to information 
from the Yugoslav Army and foreign Ministry, an incident occurred 
at around 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) in the village of Dulje on the road connecting 
Pristina, the capital, and Prizren near the Albanian border. Bullivant, 
a spokesman for the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, quoted the Yugoslav officials as saying that one soldier 
died on the spot and the other succumbed to his injuries. Another 
two wounded soldiers were taken to a hospital in Pristina. He spoke 
of ``a clear breach of the spirit of the peace agreement.'' Though 
details were still unclear Friday night, a crew for Associated Press 
Television News said earlier they had heard bursts of gunfire coming 
from the region, between Suva Reka and Stimlje villages. Traffic was 
backed up in the area. The APTN crew saw two tanks and several trucks 
full of soldiers in the vicinity. Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo 
village of Mlecane, eyewitness said Friday Serb police on Thursday 
opened fire on a group of ethnic Albanian men and children, killing 
one of the men and injuring another. The Kosovo Information Center, 
close to the Albanian leadership, also carried the report. Journalists 
visiting Mlecane Friday saw two pools of blood amid 15-20 scattered 
machine gun shells where the incident reportedly took place. Male 
villagers, who only recently returned to the homes they left earlier, 
said all the women and children had fled again. The Yugoslav Foreign 
Ministry reported Friday that ethnic Albanian rebels opened fire Thursday 
at a police vehicle traveling the main road, near Mlecane. No causalities 
were reported and it was not immediately clear the incident was linked 
to the shooting in the village. The continued shootings have chipped 
away at hopes for a solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and 
Albanians, ushered in by an Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic pledging a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb police 
forces from Kosovo. While the Kosovo Liberation Army was not privy 
to the October agreement, it says it is respecting a de-facto cease 
fire it created and responding only when attacked. Authorities claim 
the guerrillas are provoking fights, hoping for a massive response 
which will revive the threat of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslav targets.
