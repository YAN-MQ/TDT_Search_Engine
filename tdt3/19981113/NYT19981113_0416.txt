At 1 p.m. Thursday, cool melodies and shimmering chords floated over 
midtown Manhattan. These were the sweetest sounds to date from a deepening 
labor dispute between National Basketball Association players and 
team owners. The unlikely source of this music was the new NBA Store, 
on Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street. If you are a player, the store is 
enemy territory; for the owners, the store is one more golden goose. 
For a tourist, the store is a cornucopia of NBA paraphernalia. For 
Wayman Tisdale, a recently retired NBA star, the store is simply another 
stage on which to exhibit a new full-time career _ music. On Thursday 
waves of fans and tourists stopped in. Some listened, some browsed, 
others watched a large screen showing famous moments from NBA championship 
games. Tisdale's quartet _ keyboards, drums, saxophone and Tisdale's 
bass guitar _ provided background music from a simulated center court 
stage on the ground floor of the three-story store. After his set, 
Tisdale spoke about the NBA lockout. He had once served as a player 
representative. ``I can see both sides,'' he said. ``The players are 
a little high, the owners are a little low. A couple more missed checks, 
a couple more empty arenas, they'll both start to see the light. ``It's 
good to see us players united. I still say us. Once a player, always 
a player.'' Asked about performing with his band at the NBA Store, 
Tisdale smiled. ``I guess they'll call me a scab,'' he said. These 
NBA labor wars are part of Tisdale's former life. His new life features 
rhythm over movement; space and time over muscle. The transition from 
full-time athlete to full-time musician has been relatively painless. 
For most of his 12 NBA seasons, music and basketball were ballasts 
in his life. If he wasn't practicing a new shot, he was practicing 
a new lick on the bass. He could straddle the fence, though basketball 
was his safety net. ``I always had two things,'' he said. ``Now I 
have only one. That's an adjustment.'' Tisdale, 34, sat out last season 
with injuries, and music became a dominant part of his life. He realized 
the time had come to make the break; all he needed was the nerve to 
break it. Last year, Tisdale's father, the Rev. Luis Tisdale, died 
suddenly. Basketball helped Tisdale keep his head straight, but his 
father's death shocked him into making the transition. ``I realized 
that it was time for a new beginning,'' Tisdale said. ``It was time 
to grow up, be a man. I couldn't lean on him anymore.'' Since being 
in this new world, Tisdale's view of management-employee dynamics 
has shifted. Life as a full-time band leader has broadened Tisdale's 
outlook on the realities of running a business. In this view, players 
are like sidemen. Their priority is showing up for the job, playing, 
getting paid and enjoying their life. Owners are the bandleaders. 
Tisdale has to make sure rehearsal space is guaranteed, transportation 
is arranged and the sound system is right. He has to pay the musicians 
and establish the value of his players. ``If the group's not getting 
the job done, I have to make some changes,'' Tisdale said. ``If you're 
not on time, your life with me is very short.'' Like an NBA owner, 
he understands the need to be able to stick to a budget. ``When the 
group goes on a trip,'' he said, ``I have to know what I will come 
home with. As I make money, more money, the band should make more 
money.'' Tisdale said this was where the comparisons with NBA owners 
ended, though. ``I'm going to be straight and lay it all out for the 
band,'' he said, ``let them know what we're making. I'm not going 
to hide things, push figures under the table. I lay it out straight.'' 
The band is all packed now, ready to go, waiting for their leader 
to finish and lay out the plans for the rest of the day. Tisdale stretches 
his 6-foot-9-inch frame and gives instructions: book a rehearsal studio, 
load the van, solidify the guest list for the gig. This will be his 
life for the next six months: Atlanta, Washington, then out to California 
for a Christmas tour. A new life _ a hectic life but a full life. 
``It feels good to retire, go out, and have something else to do,'' 
Tisdale said as he slung his bass guitar over his shoulder. ``The 
greatest fear, the biggest question most players have is, What am 
I going to do when I retire? You'd be surprised how many guys never 
really think of the future. It's easy to get caught up in this life 
and think it's never going to end, instead of realizing this is a 
five- or six-year career. I was blessed: I always knew.'' With that, 
Wayman Lawrence Tisdale walked up the steps, out of the NBA Store 
and into a new life, the rarest of breeds: he is a former NBA player 
who is still playing.
