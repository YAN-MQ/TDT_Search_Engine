A former Rwandan military officer pleaded innocent Friday to charges 
he was responsible for the killings of 10 Belgian peace keepers and 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana at the outset of the Rwandan 
genocide in April 1994. In his first appearance at the U.N. International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Maj. Bernard Ntuyahaga said he was innocent 
of the charges that allege he gave the orders to disarm and arrest 
the 10 Belgians escorting the Hutu prime minister, leaving her open 
to assault by those leading the genocide. The charges said special 
Rwandan military units then proceeded to ``track down, arrest, sexually 
assault and kill the Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana.'' Ntuyahaga 
is also alleged to have been present when the 10 peacekeepers, there 
under the auspices of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda, 
were later beaten and killed at a Rwandan army base in the capital 
Kigali. Orchestrated by an extremist Hutu government, the genocide 
of minority Rwandan Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus began April 
7, 1994, a day after Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana died when 
his plane was shot down by unidentified assailants. Over the next 
three months, more than 500,000 Tutsis were slaughtered, many by their 
Hutu neighbors incited by a government-sponsored hate campaign. The 
charges allege that Ntuyahaga's actions ``were part of a systematic 
attack against a civilian population on political or national grounds 
and thereby constituted a Crime Against Humanity,'' the court said 
in a statement released Friday. The U.N. tribunal was established 
in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha in November 1994 to bring 
the leaders of Rwanda's genocide to justice. The tribunal has 32 suspects 
in custody and has convicted one defendant and sentenced him to life 
imprisonment. He is appealing. Another defendant pleaded guilty and 
was also sentenced to life in prison, the maximum sentence the tribunal 
can impose. Ntuyahaga was born in 1952 in Kibuye in western Rwanda. 
He assumed command of the Rwandan Armed Forces 74th Battalion in the 
Kigali sector in May 1994. He surrendered to the tribunal on June 
8. No trial date has been set.
