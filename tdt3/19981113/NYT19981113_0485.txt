Two of the four police officers facing federal civil rights charges 
in the attack on a Haitian immigrant in Brooklyn last year have incriminated 
one of the other officers in the most brutal part of the assault, 
according to documents unsealed Friday in federal district court in 
Brooklyn. Prosecutors say the immigrant, Abner Louima, was beaten 
by the four officers in a police car after his arrest in a street 
brawl on Aug. 9, 1997. The officers who are quoted in the court papers, 
Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder, are charged with taking part in the 
beating in the police car. The officer they incriminated, Justin A. 
Volpe, is accused of ramming a stick into Louima's rectum and then 
his mouth in a bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush, 
causing severe internal injuries. Wiese is quoted in the court papers 
as saying that he went into the bathroom after Volpe had entered with 
Louima, and saw Louima lying face down on the floor, ``his pants and 
underpants down at his ankles, and Volpe holding the stick full of 
feces.'' Wiese is also quoted as saying that Volpe told him that night 
that Louima had ``defecated on himself.'' Wiese's statement came in 
a memorandum written by two of Louima's lawyers, Johnnie L. Cochran 
Jr. and Peter J. Neufeld. It was originally written for their own 
files in November 1997, three months after Louima was brutalized and 
just after the two lawyers met with Wiese's lawyers, Joseph Tacopina 
and Russell M. Gioiella. According to papers filed by the officer's 
lawyers, they met with Louima's lawyers in the hopes of persuading 
them to ``treat Wiese as a witness'' for Louima in a civil suit that 
Louima has filed against all four accused officers, the city and other 
parties. Wiese's lawyers also said that if there were a ``reconciliation 
between'' the accounts of Wiese and Louima, this would ``greatly increase 
the potential of Wiese avoiding an indictment.'' Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn 
M. Kornberg, denounced Wiese's statements in the memorandum as unreliable. 
First, he said, it was double hearsay because the statements were 
contained in an account written by Louima's lawyers based on conversations 
they had had with Wiese's lawyers, and were not based on conversations 
with the officer himself. Second, Kornberg said, Wiese's account ``is 
the same story that Wiese tried to sell'' to investigators shortly 
after Louima's encounter with the police. ``It didn't fly'' then, 
he said, ``and it won't fly now.'' He was referring to the fact that 
when Wiese's account conflicted with that of an officer not charged 
in the case, the investigators chose to believe the other officer, 
saying Wiese had failed a lie detector test. Wiese's lawyers maintain 
that the test was defective and say he passed a subsequent test. Wiese 
was indicted in February, along with the other accused officers, by 
a federal grand jury that charged them with violating Louima's civil 
rights. Bruder was quoted in a November 1997 Federal Bureau of Investigation 
report _ also part of the material unsealed Friday _ as telling agents 
that he had seen Volpe take Louima into the station house bathroom. 
Bruder is also quoted as telling the agents that Volpe later told 
him, `` `I whacked him in the ass with a mop handle.' '' Kornberg 
said Bruder's statement could not be believed. He noted that among 
the charges the grand jury brought against Bruder was that in the 
same FBI interview, he lied to the agents about a detail of Louima's 
arrest. The fourth officer charged with violating Louima's civil rights, 
Charles Schwarz, is accused of holding him down while he was being 
attacked with the stick. All four officers deny all the charges. The 
memorandum from Louima's lawyers and the FBI report were part of a 
batch of documents in the case that the presiding judge, Eugene H. 
Nickerson, ordered unsealed, saying, ``I don't like sealed papers.''
