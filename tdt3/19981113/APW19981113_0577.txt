Israel's government confirmed Friday that it has authorized the paving 
of 13 roads to Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including one 
that will reportedly require the expropriation of thousands of acres 
of Palestinian-owned land. The Palestinians sharply protested the 
decision. ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging 
for the peace process and is a direct provocation to the Palestinians,'' 
said Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Palestinian 
negotiator Hassan Asfour said that while the Palestinians had expected 
that some roads would be built, they were taken aback by the large 
number of projects authorized. U.S. officials were also critical of 
Israel's decision. The latest dispute came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis 
Ross was en route to the region to oversee implementation of the new 
land-for-security agreement. Ross was to meet separately with Arafat 
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday. As part of 
the agreement, Israel is to gradually withdraw from 13 percent of 
the West Bank by the end of January. The pullback will turn several 
Jewish settlements into isolated enclaves in Palestinian-controlled 
areas and Israel has said it needs to pave new roads to ensure safe 
passage to all settlers. On Thursday, Netanyahu and senior Cabinet 
ministers authorized the paving of bypass roads, although initial 
reports were unclear on how many and which projects had been approved. 
Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Friday that in all, 13 roads 
would be paved, including one that will stretch from near the West 
Bank town of Hebron and past the Palestinian refugee camp of Al Aroub 
to Jerusalem and is known as the ``Al Aroub bypass.'' Israeli Defense 
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and the armed forces chief of staff, Lt. 
Gen. Shaul Mofaz, reportedly oppose the Al Aroub project, arguing 
the road work could lead to Palestinian riots because so much land 
will have to be expropriated. Asfour, the Palestinian negotiator, 
said that for the paving of the Al Aroub bypass, Israel would have 
to expropriate land in areas already under Palestinian control. Bar-Illan
