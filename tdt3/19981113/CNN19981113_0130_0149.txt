The United States is boosting its military presence in the gulf region. 
The United States is sending 12 B-52 bombers cruise headed for the 
island of Diego Garcia in the Indian ocean. In California, 400 air 
force personnel from Travis air force base are being assigned to the 
gulf region. Troops from Georgia's FT. Stewart have been told to prepare 
as well. Aram Roston has details. The soldiers have to show they have 
packed their socks, their coveralls -- Envelopes. Even envelopes and 
stamps for writing home. The sergeant checks everything off on a list. 
Each young solder packs two duffel bags and a rucksack, that's all 
the personal belongings the army says they'll need. 20-year-old Brandon 
Cain says his family is worried, but he's not. I'm going over there, 
and I'm doing my job. I'm doing what I'm gettin' paid to do. Two battalions 
from FT. Stewart are preparing to deploy. Another battalion is already 
in Kuwait on exercises. Much of what they have to do here is routine 
-- checking and rechecking equipment, stencilling helmets and loading 
up. Officers say, once they get the order, they can get these troops 
to the gulf in less than a week. The m1-a1 tanks and the Bradley fighting 
vehicles are already prepositioned in Kuwait. All your personal affairs 
in order? That's why we're going through this. Before the troops leave, 
they have a chance to attend to the final details -- inoculations, 
insurance, paperwork and their wills. Aram Roston, CNN, FT. Stewart, 
Georgia.
