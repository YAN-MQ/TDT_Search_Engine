Over the summer, it seemed, bank stocks came a cropper. Investors 
recoiled at the banks' emerging-markets exposure, their hedge fund 
loans and the potential damage from an impending recession. By Oct. 
8, the sector had dropped 40.3 percent from its high on July 15. After 
the Federal Reserve's one-two cut in the federal funds rate last month, 
however, the question now is: How high will bank stocks bounce? ``The 
decline was overdone,'' said Carl Dorf, portfolio manager of Pilgrim 
America Bank and Thrift, a top-ranking financial specialty fund, from 
his office in downtown Phoenix. Despite the rebound that started a 
couple of weeks ago, Dorf said, ``we think the sector is still much 
cheaper than the market.'' ``There's no reason why industrial companies 
should trade at 20-plus times earnings, while my group trades at 13 
times earnings,'' he added. ``Decent regional banks should trade at 
average market multiples.'' His investing ideas have been, well, money 
in the bank for shareholders. The fund returned an annual average 
of 33.1 percent for the three years through Nov. 6, putting it in 
first place among 19 specialty financial funds tracked over that period, 
according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. The 
group returned 25.1 percent. This year, however, the fund has lost 
2.6 percent through Nov. 6, compared with a positive, if measly, return 
of 1.8 percent for the group, according to Morningstar. Dorf attributes 
that underperformance, in part, to a big influx of cash. Bank and 
Thrift began in 1986 as a closed-end fund called Pilgrim Regional 
Bank Shares; Dorf took over the fund in 1991. In October 1997, with 
assets of $354.2 million, it converted into a mutual fund and now 
has assets of $878.9 million. Despite the structural changes, Dorf's 
strategy has stayed consistent. ``We try to be risk-averse,'' he said, 
avoiding companies with high levels of bad loans. If he thinks financial 
stocks are likely to underperform, he can raise the fund's cash position 
to as high as 100 percent. However, he has never lifted it above 10 
percent and it is now 7.7 percent. Seeking quality at cheap prices, 
he says he usually will not buy a stock or add to a holding if its 
price-to-earnings multiple is higher than the average for the portfolio, 
now 13.5. Dorf, 58, uses his own model to unearth value. He monitors 
a fairly small, informal universe of about 200 banks, savings institutions 
and financial services companies, from which he selects the 90 held 
in the fund. The model reviews some 30 pieces of financial information, 
among the most important being asset quality, measured by, say, the 
percentage of nonperforming assets and the size of the reserve for 
losses. But he also pays heed to subjective factors, like management's 
skill and commitment to shareholders; the loan portfolio mix, and 
the various types of businesses it operates. For example, he recently 
added to his position in Charter One Financial, a savings institution 
based in Cleveland that is already the fund's biggest holding. Management 
is shareholder oriented, Dorf said, and the chief executive, Charles 
John Koch, held close to 1 percent of the company as of last February. 
``Every one-point move in the stock price means more to the chief 
executive than his annual salary,'' Dorf said. Charter One has what 
Dorf calls excellent credit quality, yet sells for just 12.8 times 
projected 1999 earnings. In addition, management has shifted the portfolio 
mix from single-family mortgages toward higher-yielding consumer assets 
like auto, consumer and home equity loans, he said. He expects annual 
earnings growth of 12 percent over three to five years. The stock 
now trades at $28.46875. He also added recently to his position in 
the BankBoston Corp., which has a large presence in Argentina and 
Brazil. ``Shares started to look very cheap because the market was 
reacting to fears of a devaluation in Brazil,'' he said. He said he 
usually avoided a bank with international exposure unless it is dominant 
in a particular market. In this case, ``Argentina and Brazil think 
that Bank of Boston is a local company, and that the United States 
is a subsidiary,'' he quipped. He also said the company was hedged 
against any potential devaluation. Dorf expects earnings to grow 9.8 
percent in 1999; the stock is now at $41.125. A recent buy is Sirrom 
Capital of Nashville, which lends money to small companies. Dorf compares 
Sirrom's business to venture capital lending, but Sirrom offsets the 
risk by taking warrants in the companies, allowing it to acquire stock 
at a fixed price. ``A decent number don't survive, but some of the 
ones that do tend to be big winners,'' he said. Sirrom traded at more 
than $30 a share in the spring, but several of its loans have since 
gone bad. Dorf bought shares at prices ranging from $4.625 to $13. 
The fund is betting that the market ``has made a mistake,'' he said, 
adding that the company's stated book value per share is considerably 
greater than its stock price, now $5.625. After Dorf buys a stock, 
he tends to hold on. The fund's turnover rate was 22 percent last 
year, compared with an average of 84 percent for all United States 
stock funds. Unlike cheerleading sell-side analysts, Dorf is not a 
great fan of the big-name mergers that have refashioned the financial 
services industry. For example, he does not own the newly meshed Citigroup, 
because of its high foreign and credit card exposure as well as what 
he euphemistically called ``management risk'' _ evidenced by the departure 
of its former president, James E. Dimon. He holds some BankAmerica 
stock, originally bought as Nationsbank shares, but sounds decidedly 
downbeat. ``I didn't like the acquisition because it gave me international 
exposure I didn't want,'' he said. ``Over all, it's a terrific franchise, 
but the timing is not judicious.''
