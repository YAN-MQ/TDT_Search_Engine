Ventura's surprising win is credited to support from younger voters. 
While his television ad campaign took a decidedly highbrow approach, 
it was missing one thing. Pat Kessler from affiliate wcco explains. 
You know, so what's the point? Our new governor is a big man, but 
he's complaining that nonstop eat-and-run campaigning left him -- 
well, let him say it. I've gotten fat as a pig, in my view, you know, 
not in everyone else's view, but in my view, I'm fat and out of shape 
right now. And I don't have the name "the body" for nothing. Navy 
seal, union member. And, yet, Ventura's wildly popular television 
ad called "the thinker" showed a muscle-bound, physically fit candidate 
clad only in running shorts. That commercial was said to be a key 
factor in pushing Jesse Ventura over the top. But Jesse "the body" 
had a body double. You're lookin' good. Meet J.R. bona, all 6'4", 
260 pounds of him, professional wrestler himself and owner of the 
powerhouse gym in Roseville. It was great that I got to do it. I appreciate 
the opportunity to get to work with the guy. Bona shaved his head 
for the part. Well, if I'm gonna shave it, that would be the only 
guy I'd shave it for. And he looked so much like the new governor, 
he dressed as Jesse for halloween. I guarantee you, Jesse, if you're 
listening, I got you lot of votes that night, you know? Who will fight 
to lower property and income taxes -- Ventura's head on a bona's body, 
and history was made.
