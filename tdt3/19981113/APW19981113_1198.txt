Tim Henman blanked Magnus Gustafsson in a third-set tiebreak to reach 
the semifinals of the Stockholm Open Friday night and a berth in the 
ATP Tour World Championships. Henman, ranked 10th in the world and 
the highest seed (3) left in this tournament, won 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-0) 
before a sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall. ``It was very close 
as the scoreboard shows, it was a very good tiebreak,'' Henman said. 
``That was the difference between us. It put me in the Championships. 
It's been on my mind for the past six weeks. I'm really, really pleased.'' 
Henman broke for 4-2 in the third set. But the Swede, cheered on by 
his home fans, broke right back in the next game. Both players then 
held their serves, setting up the tiebreak. Henman, who clinched the 
seventh and penultimate berth in the ATP Tour World Championships 
in Hanover, Germany, later this month, will play Todd Martin in the 
semifinals. Martin stopped Takao Suzuki's run in the Stockholm Open, 
beating the Japanese qualifier 6-3, 6-4 in the first quarterfinal. 
Two British players are now in the opposite side of the draw going 
into Saturday's semifinals. The only British player to win the tournament, 
one of the world's oldest indoors, was Mark Cox in 1976 after a stunning 
semifinal win over Jimmy Connors. Greg Rusedski outlasted Daniel Nestor 
in a quarterfinal clash between two Canadian-born players 7-6 (7-2), 
1-6, 6-3. In the semis, Rusedski will play Thomas Johansson or Jason 
Stoltenberg, who upset top-ranked Pete Sampras in the opening round. 
Rusedski hurt a gluteal muscle during the match and was treated by 
a trainer in the second set, won by Nestor after ripping off 10 straight 
points and taking the last two games to love. ``I got painkillers,'' 
Rusedski said. ``It felt like I pulled it a little bit. But he (the 
trainer) said it was basically an overuse of the muscle. He doesn't 
feel that it's anything that will cause me damage. I'll just go out 
and play tomorrow. I'm pleased it's too serious.'' Rusedski, the fourth-seed, 
broke Nestor's serve for the only time in the decisive set to take 
a 4-2 lead. A marathon game that lasted more than 10 minutes, Rusedski 
won it on his fifth break point when Nestor netted a volley. ``I just 
had to forget about it (the injury) in the third set and go for it,'' 
Rusedski said. ``Fortunately for me I managed to get the only break 
in the third set. That was the key game. It could have gone either 
which way.'' It was the Briton's 32nd victory indoors this year, tops 
on the ATP Tour. Last week, Rusedski beat Sampras to win the Paris 
Open, his biggest tournament victory. Rusedski, who is looking to 
qualify for the ATP Tour World Championship for the second consecutive 
year, also reached the semis here last year but lost to Jan Siemerink. 
Martin broke Suzuki twice in game seven and nine to win the first 
set. After trading service breaks early in the second set, Martin 
broke Suzuki again in the last game. Suzuki fell behind 15-40 after 
two superb crosscourt returns by Martin. The American clinched the 
match with a perfect lob. ``The key point of the game came at 15 all 
in the last game, when I hit a passing shot for a winner,'' Martin 
said. ``That gave me a boost and took the wind out of him.'' ``I feel 
I'm playing great, better than a few years ago. That's more than I 
can ask for. I just hope it continues for the rest of the week and 
that it doesn't vanish come 1999.''
