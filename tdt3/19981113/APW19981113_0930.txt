Armed men raided a farm east of Harare and shot dead one of the homestead 
occupants, the main white farmers' organization said Friday. Edward 
Benzies, aged in his 40s, died from gun shot wounds in the attack 
late Thursday at Bromley, a mainly white farming area 50 kilometers 
(30 miles) east of the Zimbabwe capital, the Commercial Farmers' Union 
said. Benzies was not a farmer but lived at the homestead. No further 
details were available from police but the union said it was believed 
three attackers were arrested and that the attack was motivated by 
robbery. On Wednesday, an elderly white woman, the owner of a farm 
at nearby Marondera and an outspoken critic of the government's plan 
to nationalize white-owned farms, died when her homestead was torched. 
While the death was on Wednesday attributed to a nationwide strike 
against deteriorating economic conditions, police said Friday that 
the 70-year-old Sylvia Jackson was burned to death after one of her 
workers set the building alight with gas canisters in a dispute over 
pay. The worker was arrested and confessed to his action, said police 
spokesman Claudius Mateko in Marondera, 25 kilometers (15 miles) east 
of Bromley. But neighbors said squatters earlier blockaded Jackson's 
driveway and demanded she leave the property. Earlier this year, she 
was accused by local officials of racism after she complained her 
sheep suffered from parasites left by black trespassers on her land. 
The homestead attacks, rare in the former Rhodesia, came as fears 
mounted among the nation's 4,000 white farmers. Squatters have settled 
themselves on several farms in wheat, tobacco and corn growing areas 
east of Harare in recent weeks. In a separate development Friday, 
the Commercial Farmers Union leader Bob Swift resigned his post, citing 
what he described as ``the fast deteriorating land issue'' and an 
impasse between farmers and the government over proposed land seizures. 
The union said it accepted his resignation in light of continuing 
seizures and farm ``invasions'' by squatters. A former union president, 
Nick Swanepoel, agreed to replace Swift.
