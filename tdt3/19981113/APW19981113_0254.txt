Armed Serb civilians swapped hostages with ethnic Albanian guerrillas 
on Friday, after international monitors intervened to defuse the crisis. 
All three sides _ Kosovo Albanians, Serb officials and the monitors 
_ confirmed that two Serb civilians held since Wednesday by the separatist 
guerillas were released in exchange for the seven remaining ethnic 
Albanians still held by the Serbs. The Serbs seized as many as 100 
Kosovo Albanians starting Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road 
from neighboring Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. 
The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people who 
went missing in the central Drenica region, a trouble spot throughout 
much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces on guerrillas 
seeking independence for Kosovo, the Albanian-majority Serbian province. 
The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the boundary 
with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources. The detentions, 
and emotional pledges of revenge at a funeral for slain fighters of 
the Kosovo Liberation Army guerillas, reflected the high level of 
Serb-Albanian tensions even after an Oct. 12 agreement to end the 
Kosovo crisis. The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists has 
left hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and made refugees of 
hundreds of thousands more. In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader 
Ibrahim Rugova told Serbs _ a less than 10 percent minority in the 
province _ they had nothing to fear from the October agreement, ultimately 
aimed at restoring wide-ranging Albanian autonomy in Kosovo. ``All 
Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he told reporters. The
