Down a drab corridor in the basement of the Empire State Building, 
in an austere, glaringly lighted employee dining room, six security 
guards chatted at a table on Wednesday morning. In front of them sat 
a box of Girl Scout Thin Mints. On the far side of a flimsy partition, 
Robert Stockard, a cheery, upbeat sales pro, was in the midst of a 
training session. He had come here on this rainy morning to try to 
impart a professional's touch to a group of Girl Scouts, ages 7 to 
11, who were about to head off into the cruel, man-eat-cookie world 
_ the lobby _ to sell some Samoas, Thin Mints and Trefoils. ``Selling 
is a lot of acting,'' Stockard told them. ``Now my partner, Maria, 
is going to play a tough cookie.'' Up stepped Maria Massaro, who turned 
out to be not such a tough cookie after all. Stockard, the designated 
cookie-seller, made his pitch, and she smilingly demurred, saying, 
``I don't eat chocolate.'' (Stockard, in a stage whisper: ``She really 
loves chocolate.'') But Ms. Massaro quickly became a pushover, buying 
box after box of whatever he offered. ``Notice,'' Stockard said, ``that 
I didn't ask, `Would you like to buy?' but `How many would you like 
to buy?''' Try as he might, he couldn't keep the odd bit of sales 
jargon from bubbling to the surface: ``When I ask, `Do you have any 
friends who want cookies?' that's what we call the final close.'' 
The girls joined the role-playing, and they too proved to be soft 
touches, eagerly buying even when the whole pitch was a faint ``Would 
you like to buy some cookies?'' They were having fun now. It had not 
taken long to break through their shyness. Stockard, president of 
Sales Staffers International of Andover, Mass., had started with a 
hearty ``Ready to have some fun?'' Eliciting a chorus of muffled affirmatives, 
he then asked what the girls wanted to raise money for. One girl said, 
``Disney World,'' and then Stephanie Rivera, a tiny, black-haired 
7-year-old from the Bronx, murmured something indecipherable. ``You 
want to do bikes with lobsters?'' Stockard asked incredulously. He 
leaned close to Stephanie; she whispered something, and Stockard stood 
up and clarified matters. ``Oh, you want to do your nails, buy dresses 
and go to the Red Lobster,'' he said. Stephanie gave a faint nod. 
The Girl Scouts would seem to be in scant need of sales advice; nationwide, 
they sold 190 million boxes last year. (Local councils set prices 
and keep profits, so no dollar figures were available. But do the 
math: This is a half-billion-dollar business.) Stockard, unawed by 
such numbers, plunged ahead with his ``cookie wheel,'' a nine-step 
sales process. Step 1 was ``Smile,'' and Stockard asked the girls 
why that was important. Kandis Bennet, a self-assured 11-year-old 
from Queens, responded quickly, ``To make a good impression.'' Very 
good, Kandis. Smiling all the way, Stockard, 40, led them along the 
wheel, through Step 4, ``We now have cookies for people on special 
diets''; Step 7, ``Are you sure you ordered enough boxes?'' to the 
final, indispensable Step 9, ``Thank you very much.'' The seven girls 
_ resplendent in brown or green uniforms _ took this all in with varying 
degrees of attentiveness, the younger ones clearly with less weighty 
thoughts on their roving minds. It was time to head upstairs to the 
lobby, amid murmurs of ``They got more than us'' as the samples were 
gathered. What did Stephanie, say, glean from her half-hour or so 
of training? ``Be polite,'' she said with a shrug, and then, more 
gleefully, ``Get some money.'' How many would she sell today? ``A 
whole bunch,'' she said spiritedly. The moment of truth was at hand. 
In the lobby, 100 cartons of cookies were stacked against one wall, 
and the girls lined boxes up meticulously on a table. Corrine Rivera, 
Stephanie's twin, had removed one of her shiny black shoes and nearly 
tumbled as she danced playfully on the polished floor. A tiny figure 
in the spacious lobby, she seemed more badge-covered uniform than 
girl. A workman on a ladder putting up a banner for the event, dubbed 
``Turning Cookies Into Dough,'' called over, ``Do you take credit 
cards?'' Jade Randall, a sharp 10-year-old who had just made the day's 
first sale, eyeing the $10 bill closely through thick glasses, shot 
back, ``No, just cash.'' ``You should have come on payday, then,'' 
the workman countered jovially. The table ready, some girls started 
making their pitch, the nine-step script usually crumbling to ``Want 
to buy some cookies?'' They soon discovered that the Empire State 
Building crowd was not a pushover like Ms. Massaro. Some passers-by 
gave puzzled looks; others walked with the stony obliviousness that 
New Yorkers have polished to a high art. ``We're just looking for 
the observatory elevator,'' one flustered woman said by way of a no. 
Caitlin Faraday, 8, at the suggestion that potential customers were 
getting by unpitched, said with a firm sense of territory, ``We're 
getting them from this aisle.'' Stockard, born salesman, could not 
for the life of him stay out of the fray. ``Make any sales yet, ladies?'' 
he asked. Or, ``Good try, girls!'' Often he made a pitch himself. 
``I can't help it,'' he said, grinning. Once he reported excitedly, 
``That girl upsold a customer.'' Upsold? Uh-oh. Jargon alert. ``Got 
her to buy more than she'd planned,'' he hurriedly translated. And 
when a woman asked, ``Do you have any low-fat?'' he was in trainer's 
heaven. ``I love it when they follow the script,'' he exulted. Gradually 
customers materialized. ``Can we just buy some?'' one woman asked 
sheepishly amid the banners and cameras. ``I have a list,'' another 
said as she scooped up eight or 10 boxes. And another: ``I heard you 
were down here and I came running.'' Did the professionally honed 
sales pitch help? ``It was the smiles,'' one man said. ``Always effective.'' 
But another said gruffly, ``It's the product, not the sales pitch,'' 
as he snared his Thin Mints _ the top seller nationwide. ``They're 
$3 a box?'' one customer said in mock horror, and then added, ``Oh, 
Girl Scouts _ wonderful organization!'' Yes, $3 is a lot for an 8- 
or 10-ounce box (which costs the organization 82 cents), but the good 
cause reels them in. Near noon, Jade asked for the time _ not because 
she was tired, but so she would know whether to say ``Good morning'' 
or ``Good afternoon.'' As the day wore on, the girls did grow weary, 
and by lunch time, with the lobby hopping, it was mostly the troop 
leaders doing the selling. Half the 100 cartons had vanished. By day's 
end, nearly all had been sold. So what is Stockard's angle? Is his 
donated training just a publicity stunt for Sales Staffers, a private 
company that provides training, marketing services and sales representatives 
to large corporations? He dispelled that idea convincingly. ``I was 
a Scout as a kid,'' he said. ``I saw how much parents helped. Now 
we want to do anything we can to help these girls' confidence levels. 
It's nice to see their eyes light up.'' Why seek publicity then? ``We 
want to make our employees proud, and to have clients see what we're 
doing _ we'd like them to give something back to society.'' The children, 
he said, ``are our future.'' Beverly Cheuvront, public relations director 
for the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, added: ``The real 
value is to learn how to set goals, do budgeting, meet goals. These 
skills are transferable to all aspects of their lives.'' She had offered 
the girls a real-world use: ``You can use these sales skills to convince 
your teacher you deserve an A.'' Ms. Massaro, president of Sales Consultants 
of Boston and co-founder of Stockard's company, echoed the upbeat 
tone but refined the goal, saying: ``I hope a few girls are inspired 
today to go into sales. You don't grow up wanting to be a sales rep, 
after all.'' Kandis, at the suggestion that she might go into sales, 
crinkled her nose in a distinct negative. Then she enthusiastically 
got back to her selling.
