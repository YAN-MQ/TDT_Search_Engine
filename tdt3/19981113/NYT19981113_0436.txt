Secretary-General Kofi Annan made a last-ditch appeal to Iraq on Friday 
night to make a ``wise decision'' and end its defiance of international 
arms inspections. His plea followed a five-hour meeting with the Security 
Council that failed to agree on any other diplomatic steps that could 
or should be taken to budge President Saddam Hussein from the entrenched 
position that has put Iraq under the threat of U.S. attack. There 
was an atmosphere of futility around the meeting, since both the council 
and Annan have been delivering the same message to the Iraqis for 
nearly two weeks, and there is a sense that military action is probably 
inevitable. ``All stressed the desirability of a peaceful and diplomatic 
solution, but events on the ground may be running away from us,'' 
Annan said after the meeting. The council and the secretary-general 
agreed that he would write a letter to the Iraqi leadership, restating 
his demand that Baghdad rescind orders stopping cooperation with arms 
inspectors and reminding the Iraqis that they would get a comprehensive 
review of their relations with the United Nations in return. A visibly 
exhausted secretary-general emerged from the council session to make 
his public appeal to Baghdad, before meeting Iraq's representative 
at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, who told reporters later that 
he hoped the United States would ``give diplomacy a real chance.'' 
``I would use this opportunity once again to urge President Saddam 
Hussein and the Iraqi leadership to take a wise decision of resuming 
cooperation with UNSCOM and the atomic agency,'' Annan said, referring 
to the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. ``I hope that this appeal will be listened to by the Iraqis 
authorities.'' To encourage the Iraqis, Annan held out again the promise 
that a comprehensive review could lead to a lifting of sanctions if 
Iraq extended full cooperation to UNSCOM inspectors. Annan made no 
mention of a trip to Baghdad, as the Iraqis are urging. The secretary-general 
spoke with President Clinton by telephone Friday morning, his aides 
said, and was apparently told then that the United States was not 
in favor of a trip to Iraq by the secretary-general, at least not 
at this point. U.N. officials said that Annan would not go to Baghdad 
a second time this year, with the Iraqis having broken the first agreement, 
unless he had absolute assurance in advance that Saddam would reverse 
decisions made Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 that shut down arms inspections 
in Iraq. Annan met Friday morning with the representatives of China, 
France and Russia, who are pressing the secretary-general to take 
some kind of diplomatic initiative, though diplomats said the Russians 
did not suggest that there was anything to negotiate with the Iraqis. 
In Baghdad on Friday, Russia's ambassador delivered two letters to 
Saddam, one from President Boris Yeltsin and another from Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov. Both were critical of Iraq for raising the present 
crisis to a dangerous level by stopping all cooperation with arms 
inspectors, officials in Moscow said. Saddam was reported to have 
responded ``positively,'' but British and U.S. officials dismissed 
the gesture, saying he had merely repeated demands for a lifting of 
sanctions. U.N. officials, looking beyond bombing raids, are concerned 
that a range of programs in Iraq could be curtailed or ended by the 
Iraqis in the wake of U.S. attacks. If the Iraqis decide to flout 
sanctions, the ``oil for food'' plan under which Iraq is permitted 
to sell limited amounts of oil to pay for civilian goods and services 
could be the first victim. Saddam has apparently never liked the program, 
which was beginning to feed Iraqis and provide them with medicines, 
hospital equipment and school materials, among other imports otherwise 
denied them by an embargo. If Iraq circumvents the sanctions, there 
would in theory be no need for outside help, since oil money would 
be freely available to the Iraqis _ unless the United States was willing 
to blockade Iraq. The continuation of imports under the oil-sale program 
is already in doubt. Friday the British contractor in charge of stationing 
inspectors at Iraqi border points and ports to monitor shipments of 
food and other goods suddenly withdrew its staff in anticipation of 
U.S. attacks on Iraq. Benon Sevan, the director of the Iraq program 
for the United Nations, said in a statement that the contractor, Lloyd's 
Register, had pulled out 54 people without warning. The result, Sevan 
said, is that shipments into Iraq cannot be checked and shippers will 
not be paid, since certification by border inspectors is required 
by the oil-sale plan. Sevan said his office was ``examining various 
options with a view to restoring inspection services with the least 
possible delay in order to maintain the flow of food, medicine and 
other essential humanitarian supplies into Iraq.''
