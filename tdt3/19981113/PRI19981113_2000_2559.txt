For today's geo quiz this Friday the 13th, we tread with trepidation 
to a spooky place in Jamaica. This city used to be the capital during 
the heyday of buccaneers and pirates, and money flowed freely for 
a couple of centuries in this area, attracting shady dealers, lawless 
types from all over the world. The clergy back then called this place 
the wickedest city on earth and proclaimed that damnation would surely 
follow. And bejeebers, that's exactly what happened. In 1692, a great 
earthquake shook Jamaica, and a good part of this city sank beneath 
the waves of the Caribbean. Even today, local fishermen claim that 
in rough weather, they can hear church bells tolling undersea. So, 
what is the name of this partly submerged ghostly city that used to 
be the capital of Jamaica? In a moment, we'll give you the shivers 
and the answer.
