It's been more than two weeks since authorities heard from the crew 
of a Cruise ship believed to be caught out at sea by hurricane Mitch. 
Now the families of some crew members are suing the ship's owners. 
Susan Candiotti reports. 77 It is the "fantome's" signature song, 
"amazing grace," played when the four-masted cruise ship hoists its 
sails. A vacation aboard a windjammer cruise line tall ship was billed 
as a Romantic getaway. This home video shot just a week before the 
"fantome" disappeared during hurricane Mitch is an eerie reminder 
of her missing crew and her captain, guyan March. And if you drink, 
drink to the toast of long life, health and happiness. All 100 passengers 
arrived home safely, but the captain and 30 crew members have not 
been heard from since October 27th. That's when the ship last called 
off the coast of Honduras while trying to outrun Mitch. At the time, 
the storm appeared to be headed in the opposite direction. Tragically, 
Mitch changed course. In my view, they put the value of that boat 
over the value of the men who were sailing. That's an incredible corporate 
decision of greed. Claiming the company was negligent, attorney William 
huggett is suing windjammer on behalf of at least eight families asking 
for $1 million each. All live in the Caribbean or central and south 
America. Windjammer declined an on-camera interview, but told CNN 
-- for now, the company has given relatives of missing crew members 
two months pay up to $700 and promise a trust fund for their children. 
Some families are skeptical and angry. Norma king fears the worst 
for her missing son Jerry, a member of the crew who left behind a 
wife and three children. This is the worst storm. Why did they allow 
them to go? Save the ship. What is wrong with the crew? Windjammer 
tells CNN it is introducing a new web page on the internet so that 
"people can see the facts." Ultimately, it may be up to the courts 
to decide whether the "fantome" was apparently a victim of tragic 
circumstance or negligence. Susan Candiotti, CNN, Miami.
