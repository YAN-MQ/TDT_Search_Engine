U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan is scheduled to meet with the security 
council in less than half an hour to discuss the Iraqi standoff. Annan 
cut short a trip to Africa yesterday to return to New York. He says 
he doesn't have any plans to go to Baghdad. Iraq says Annan would 
be the best person to negotiate the current situation.
