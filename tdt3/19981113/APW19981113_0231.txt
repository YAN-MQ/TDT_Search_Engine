Two grenades were thrown Friday in a square in downtown Hebron, but 
there was no immediate word of injuries. In a similar incident in 
September, a supporter of the Islamic militant group Hamas threw two 
grenades into a group of Israeli soldiers in the square, injuring 
a dozen troops and several Palestinian civilians. The assailant was 
later arrested by Israel.
