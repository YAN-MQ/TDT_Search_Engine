Gov. Christie Whitman underwent surgery late Friday at Morristown 
Memorial Hospital for the removal of her appendix after experiencing 
abdominal pain for the last three days. Dr. John Edoga, one of two 
surgeons who performed the 90-minute procedure, said that the surgery 
went well and that Whitman could expect to be discharged from the 
hospital Saturday. She plans to return to work Monday morning, said 
her chief spokesman, Pete McDonough. But he said she might scale back 
her schedule, which includes a Republican Governors Association meeting 
next week in New Orleans and an awards ceremony Monday night that 
is expected to attract anti-abortion protesters. Whitman was vacationing 
in Florida this week when she first began to experience stomach pains 
Wednesday. She returned to New Jersey on Thursday and attended a memorial 
service for a family friend Friday morning before going to Morristown 
Memorial Hospital to meet with Edoga. Although Whitman did have some 
pain on her right side, where the appendix is located, Edoga said 
the physical findings were not convincing, so he arranged for the 
governor to have a CAT scan. ``If she were 13 years old and a boy 
it would have been much easier diagnosis,'' Edoga said. ``But with 
women, in particular, there are many more things that you have to 
consider, and that is why she had a CAT scan at the hospital.'' Whitman 
was admitted to the hospital at noon for the tests. The surgery began 
at 4:30 p.m. and ended at 6 p.m. The procedure involved making three 
small incisions in her abdomen to remove the appendix, a sac-like 
appendage of the large intestine that doctors say has no function. 
Edoga said Whitman's appendix was inflamed, but it appeared that it 
had not ruptured. There were no other signs of illness, he said. ``I 
told her that she could go home in the morning,'' said Edoga, who 
performed a similar procedure on the governor's son, Taylor, two years 
ago. ``I believe that she will be on her feet shortly. She is very 
well motivated and the patient's motivation is all important.'' In 
the last three years, Whitman has undergone two other surgical procedures 
at Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J. In February, 1996, 
she underwent an hourlong surgical procedure to repair her right shoulder's 
rotator cuff. In November 1995, she also underwent surgery to have 
a benign ovarian cyst removed.
