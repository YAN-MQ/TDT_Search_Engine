In a report on telephone expansion in Uganda, the International Finance 
Corp. says the number of fixed telephone connections in Uganda will 
more than double by 2002 to 1 for every 50 people. The report by the 
commercial lending arm of the World Bank was made available to the 
Associated Press Friday, a week before the opening of private bids 
to purchase 51 percent of government-owned Uganda Telecommunications 
Ltd. Leonard Muganwa, head of the Public Enterprise Reform and Divestiture 
office, said two consortia, one including WorldTel and the German 
Detecon, and the other including Nostrad and Saskatel, have qualified. 
Two private cellular phone companies _ Celtel and Mobile Telecommunications 
Network of South Africa _ are already operating in the nation of 22.5 
million. MTN, which has invested half of an estimated dlrs 70 million 
in Uganda, will introduce fixed telephone services early next year. 
Privatization of the telecommunications sector is also moving ahead 
in Tanzania, but it has not yet begun in Kenya, the third member of 
the East African Cooperation. In 1991, the state-owned Uganda Posts 
and Telecommunications Corp. was split into Uganda Posts, UTL and 
Post Bank. Muganwa said the government will temporarily retain the 
49 percent of shares in UTL which it will eventually sell to private 
investors. No one was willing to talk about the value of UTL. The 
IFC said that prior to the split, UPTC had a revenue equivalent to 
dlrs 20 million that rose to dlrs 59 million in 1997. The report said 
410 of UTL's 1,600 employees would be laid off after privatization. 
The demand for telephone lines is projected at 380,000 by 2006 from 
the current installed base of 51,829 lines, the report said. International 
inbound traffic is expected to increase from 16 million minutes in 
1997 to 176 million minutes in 2006. During the same period, international 
outbound traffic will increase from 6 million minutes in 1997 to 92 
million minutes in 2006, the report said.
