Spring Creek has overflowed its banks north of Houston, flooding some 
portions of the Texas city. Eight inches of rain fell in the area 
in just a few hours. The red cross and salvation army have set up 
shelters for people who have left their homes as a precaution. Flash 
flood watches are in effect for all of southeast Texas through tomorrow.
