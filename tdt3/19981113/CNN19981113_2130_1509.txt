You will see a different side of two other musical superstars when 
they make the leap to the small screen. Ron tank tells us what's on 
TV this weekend. Okay. It's okay. It's not going to last long sweetheart. 
It's okay. Country singer wynonna guest stars with Roma Downey in 
the 100th episode of "touched by an Angel." She plays the mother of 
a boy with cystic fibrosis, fighting for his life. God has brought 
us here to bring your petey home. With a little angelic help, dreams 
come true as the end draws near. Whatever you do, I want you to keep 
your eyes on the light. Okay? I love you, and I'm with you all the 
way. So sweet. Another singing star, Celine Dion, makes a special 
appearance as herself. Cystic fibrosis means a lot to me. We lost 
a little niece in the family a couple years back. I think when you 
-- if you can help in any way about talking about a Disease or something, 
it can touch people. And my role, being a spokesperson, is to touch 
people's hearts. Just a little touch if you believe love can move 
mountains it's a great episode, I've got to tell you, I saw it, and 
I am very pleased with that. Love can move mountains "touched by an 
Angel" touches hearts on CBS.
