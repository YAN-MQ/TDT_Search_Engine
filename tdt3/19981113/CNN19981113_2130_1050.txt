If you're heading out of the country, be aware that the state department 
is cautioning travelers. Lori Waffenschmidt has details in today's 
edition of "working ahead." The state department is recommending that 
all U.S. citizens traveling abroad maintain a high level of vigilance 
and a low profile. You may not want to, for example, wear a shirt 
that has, you know, that has stars and stripes across. Don't spend 
a great deal of time in the public open places that tourists frequent 
most often, because very often they are targets. The worldwide caution 
reflects the potential for retaliation in light of the tensions with 
Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections. The state department suggests 
Americans increase security awareness and vary routes and times for 
all required travel. Should you delay a planned trip? Virtually all 
travel agencies have access to all of our travel information and that 
can always be requested at the time that you make your travel arrangements. 
The travel agent's responsibility is to fully advise the client of 
the possibilities when they're traveling. The client needs to know 
what they're getting themselves in for so they can make an honest 
and advised, well-advised decision. If you do travel abroad, get in 
touch with the U.S. embassy in the country you're visiting for the 
latest information on security conditions. Lori Waffenschmidt, CNN, 
reporting.
