The United States says Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must reverse 
course and cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. If not, defense 
secretary William Cohen says he should be prepared for a Significant 
military strike. More U.N. workers left Baghdad Thursday in case of 
military action. Their departure follows more than 200 U.N. inspectors 
and humanitarian workers who left Iraq a day earlier. Iraqi deputy 
prime minister Tariq Aziz blames the United States for the latest 
standoff. He says Iraq has cooperated with U.N. inspectors for years, 
but the United States has continuously blocked attempts to end economic 
sanctions against his country. Why the United States attacks Iraq? 
why? Who authorized the United States to attack Iraq? say it! As a 
person first, and as a media whom do you represent? say it! Why the 
United States is preparing to bomb Iraq? Is that in the United Nations 
resolutions? Is that international law? Is that a civilian mission? 
A humanitarian mission to be conducted by the government or it is 
a sheer aggression of criminals? Clearly, Iraq is desperately trying 
to shift the blame for this crisis away from its shoulders, away from 
its doorstep, to the United States, and I think what we've seen in 
the last couple of days is that that effort is failing completely 
and totally.
