The blues language developed at the turn of the century has spread 
in so many ways over the last 100 years that its beauty is now as 
ignored as an often-seen landscape. The small accumulation of its 
repeated ideas, the graceful rising and falling of melodies, its percussive 
drive, all have become familiar. The miracle of the blues riff _ the 
way it constructs narrative, its systemic coherence and its improvisational 
electricity _ is taken as simply improvisation, something tossed off. 
Jazz at Lincoln Center's ``Blues Up and Down: A Battle in the Bucket,'' 
at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday night, came advertised as a cutting 
contest, but instead acted as a dust-clearer, ridding older compositions 
and melodies and improvisatory ideas of their status as antiquities. 
Songs like Nat Adderley's ``Work Song'' and Bobby Timmons' ``Moanin''' 
became crystalline blues compositions again. The clarity with which 
the material was played helped, each tune receiving its own tempo, 
as did the deep understanding that a melody with few notes could be 
as important as a composition with more formal variety. Meaning comes 
from all angles, and the musicians, who will be performing again Saturday 
night, made sure that the compositions were articulated. But something 
else happened at the show. The musicians relaxed into playing in the 
blues idiom. Improvisation after improvisation brought together all 
the various rhetorical techniques jazz musicians learn from the blues. 
Teddy Edwards, the tenor saxophonist, used his nasty and bitter intonation 
to make his solos sound distilled, entire improvisations defying the 
mathematical clarity of the piano, as if he were singing in a different 
language. Al Grey, the trombonist, using a mute and a rubber plunger, 
talked through his trombone, using a whole series of vocal sounds, 
playing lines that were originally sung. And the trumpeter Harry ``Sweets'' 
Edison used a series of riffs in his solos, three- or four-note ideas, 
that added up to improvisations with hurtling momentum and logic. 
Those were the elders in the show. The younger musicians came fully 
equipped as well, and the trumpeter Nicholas Payton, on ``Moanin','' 
produced a solo of such power, using ripped and tattered notes, that 
the entire hall seemed startled. Cyrus Chestnut, playing piano, silenced 
the auditorium with his solo entrances; he let quiet spaces speak 
for him, and then used small, repeating figures, machinelike, to build 
his improvisations, connecting them all with lines or percussive slaps. 
The show brought the musicians together in all sorts of different 
combinations: Payton and Edison played together; the saxophonists 
Stephen Riley and Sherman Irby joined with the vibraphonist Stefon 
Harris to play Joe Henderson's ``Isotope.'' Competition didn't really 
exist. The musicians were there to luxuriate in the glories of a communal 
language, all the shadings, tricks and tonalities, musical and emotional, 
that the blues has given us.
