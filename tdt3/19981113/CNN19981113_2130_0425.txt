And Starr has secured a new indictment against the president's friend, 
webster Hubbell. A federal grand jury has charged him with 15 felony 
counts including fraud and perjury. This is the third time Starr has 
charged Hubbell with wrongdoing related to whitewater. The charges 
carry a maximum penalty of 110 years in prison and a $4 million fine. 
In July, a federal judge threw out Starr's indictment, ruling the 
charges were beyond the scope of his investigation.
