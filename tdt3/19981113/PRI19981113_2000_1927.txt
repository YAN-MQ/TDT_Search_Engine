The Moscow prosecutor's office has opened a criminal case against 
a Communist deputy who made a series of anti-Semitic comments. As 
Andrew Harding reports, Albert Makashov's remarks have sparked a storm 
of protest. It's more than a month since Albert Makashov stood in 
front of a crowd of nationalist supporters and said, "All those Yids 
should be rounded up and wiped out." In subsequent interviews, he 
was unapologetic, insisting that Jews were to blame for Russia's economic 
problems. Now, the Russian authorities have finally responded. Jewish 
leaders have warned that anti-Semitism is on the rise in Russia as 
people look for scapegoats to blame for the deepening economic turmoil.
