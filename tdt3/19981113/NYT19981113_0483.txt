Elvis J. Stahr Jr., an educator and environmentalist who was a secretary 
of the Army in the Kennedy administration and was later president 
of the National Audubon Society, died on Wednesday at his home in 
Greenwich, Conn. He was 82. Stahr's career spanned top jobs in the 
military, in higher education and in the environmental movement. Stahr 
was named dean of the University of Kentucky law school in 1956, became 
president of West Virginia University in 1958 and was appointed president 
of Indiana University in 1962. Between academic jobs, he was Army 
Secretary, from 1961 through 1962. That period included the Berlin 
crisis, the Bay of Pigs debacle and the federal deployment of the 
Alabama National Guard to integrate the state university. Born in 
Hickman, Ky., in 1916, Stahr graduated from the University of Kentucky 
in 1936 and in 1939, received a BA in law from Oxford University as 
a Rhodes scholar. In 1968 Stahr assumed the presidency of the National 
Audubon Society, where he led efforts to preserve the Everglades from 
commercial and industrial development. He also worked to prevent environmental 
harm from dam and water projects and to obtain accords on international 
whaling. Under his direction, the Audubon Society's membership increased 
nearly fourfold. After retiring from the society in 1981, he worked 
in his private law practice in Connecticut. Stahr is survived by his 
wife, Dorothy; two sons, Stuart, of Wappingers Falls, N.Y., and Bradford, 
of Greenwich; a daughter, Stephanie Stahr, of Vienna, Va., and two 
grandchildren.
