dell computer is losing 3 1/4. the strategy of selling computers directly 
over the internet is paying off, but investors are still cautious. 
bruce francis reports. the soaring expectation of investors can't 
be overcome. earnings were up 55% and people aren't happy? it's amazing 
the expectations that are built into this stock. and it should serve 
as somewhat of a warning to investors about the current level of prices 
here. dell is firing on all engines. even sales in asia rose by 49%. 
dell has now sold nearly $17 billion worth of computers in the past 
four quarters. and boast that it's the most profitable pcmaker t. 
internet sales outpaced any other retailers. internet sales are a 
full 20% of the revenue. much of that business, dell sets up kous 
stomized web pages. it boasts 8500 of those pages so far. a flu survey 
shows that dell is making deeper inroads into luke ra tif corporate 
sales, a market that had been dominated by compaq. dell has done very 
well in a smaller or medium business. with the government education, 
but it's never done as well, or never dominated the very large commercial 
segment. they have now done that and surpassed compaq. dell's main 
rival is far from complacent, though. just this week, compaq stole 
a page from the dell playbook, saying that it would sell computers 
directly to small and medium-sized businesses. that's the group of 
customers that first made dell a success. bruce francis, "cnn financial
