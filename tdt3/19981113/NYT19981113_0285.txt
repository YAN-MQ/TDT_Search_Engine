What really captivates him, Pierre Omidyar says, are computer-programming 
challenges. But he says he never expected to get rich tackling them, 
and recalls that most of his efforts to make money on them failed. 
With one huge exception. Three weeks ago, Gary Bengier, the chief 
financial officer of Ebay Inc., the company Omidyar founded in 1995, 
walked into his office to congratulate him. ``He said, `You're worth 
a billion dollars today,''' Omidyar recalled in a telephone interview 
from his headquarters in San Jose, Calif. ``I said, `No,''' his voice 
still trailing off in disbelief. After all, Omidyar, now 31, had started 
Ebay on a lark, posting a Web page to help people auction the stuff 
that was gathering dust in their attics. ``I never had it in mind 
that I would start a company and one day it would be really successful,'' 
he said. ``I have just been motivated by working on interesting technology.'' 
To his surprise, collectors of Barbie dolls, Beanie Babies and household 
junk of all sorts seized upon Ebay almost immediately, both as an 
online classified-ad page and as a forum to discuss their common obsessions. 
And since its public offering in September, the stock has become a 
more treasured addition to Internet stock portfolios than the Princess 
Diana bear is to Beanie Baby fans. Indeed, Omidyar's stake in the 
company is already closing in on $2 billion. Omidyar was born in Paris 
but moved to Maryland after his father, a surgeon, began his medical 
residence at the Johns Hopkins University Medical Center. As a teen-ager, 
he kept sneaking out of physical-education classes to play with the 
computers in his high school. This modest rebellion turned into a 
first brush with the financial power of technology: he was hired to 
write a program to print catalogue cards for the school's library 
for $6 an hour. Studying computers at Tufts University in Medford, 
Mass., his entrepreneurship proved little more lucrative. He wrote 
a program to help Apple Macintosh programmers manage memory and distributed 
it on line as ``shareware,'' asking users to pay on the honor system. 
The two or three checks he received barely covered the cost of the 
post office box he had rented for his receipts. After graduation, 
Omidyar worked at several companies, designing graphics programs for 
the Macintosh. In 1991, he founded a company with three friends to 
write programs for computers that received instructions by pen rather 
than keyboard. Pen computing turned into one of the more notable technology 
flops, but the company was sold to Microsoft, which was attracted 
to a shopping service it had started. Fed up with start-ups, Omidyar 
took a job as a programmer for General Magic, a developer of mobile 
computing devices. In his spare time, he made pages for the newly 
emerging World Wide Web. The inspiration for Ebay came from Pamela 
Wesley, who is now his fiancee. Ms. Wesley, a collector of Pez candy 
dispensers, had complained that she couldn't find an efficient way 
to buy or sell them on the Internet. So Omidyar started a Web page 
in 1995, allowing people to list items for sale and take bids over 
several days. The service, first called Auction Web, was free until 
the page grew so big that it outgrew Omidyar's personal Internet account 
and had to be moved to a much more expensive business account. So 
early in 1996, he started charging a few dollars to list an item and 
collecting a small commission if it was sold. It took just a few months 
before he quit his day job. ``The biggest clue was that so many checks 
were piling up at my door I had to hire part-time help to open them 
all,'' he said. Omidyar had drilled into one of the richest veins 
of the online world, the desire of people to connect with others who 
share their interests. And few interests, he came to realize, generate 
more passion than collecting. ``I thought people would simply use 
the service to buy and sell things,'' he said. ``But what they really 
enjoyed was meeting other people.'' Ebay's popularity astounded almost 
everybody. More than a million people have registered for the service, 
and they spend an average of 96 minutes a month perusing it, far more 
than for other major Web sites. Every day, 70,000 new items are put 
up for sale on Ebay. Its rapid growth and the fact it was one of the 
Internet's few profit makers made Ebay one of the most eagerly anticipated 
initial public offerings of 1998. The path, however, was rocky: Last 
August, on the day before the company began its road show to drum 
up investor interest, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by 
500 points. But by the end of September, the deal was completed, at 
an offering price of $18. The stock closed on Friday at $123.9375, 
off $2.0625, making the company worth $4.93 billion and Omidyar's 
38.3 percent stake worth $1.89 billion. Still, when you ask Omidyar 
about the high points of the last few years, he doesn't mention money. 
Rather, he talks of letters from Ebay customers who say their lives 
have been changed because the company has let them turn their collecting 
hobbies into careers. ``They became accidental entrepreneurs and found 
they could quit their jobs,'' he said. Does that sound familiar? He 
pauses, then acknowledges the point. ``I didn't set out to create 
a huge business on Ebay,'' he said. ``When it happened, I took advantage 
of it.''
