Negotiations later this month could lead to a Russian withdrawal from 
the Moldovan breakaway region of Trans-Dniester, the Moldovan president 
said Friday. The new retreat plan could be settled soon, Petru Lucinschi 
said, speaking at a news conference in the Moldovan capital. The main 
problem facing negotiators is the military equipment left behind by 
the 14th Russian Army after some of the personnel went back to Russia. 
``In the past three years, Russia retreated 3,900 soldiers but only 
two tanks from Trans-Dniester,'' said Lucinschi. Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kuchma and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov are to mediate 
a meeting between Lucinschi and Trans-Dniester leader Igor Smirnov 
in Kiev at the end of November to settle the final details. ``We are 
ready to negotiate a new status of Trans-Dniester but only as a part 
of the Moldovan state. Its autonomy can then be discussed,'' said 
Lucinschi. Trans-Dniester, a mostly Russian-speaking region in eastern 
Moldova, sought independence out of fear that Moldova would unite 
with Romania. Seven-hundred people died in 1992 in a war in Trans-Dniester 
before Russian forces intervened. Efforts to reach a settlement have 
failed so far.
