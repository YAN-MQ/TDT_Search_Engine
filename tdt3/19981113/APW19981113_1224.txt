The battery case against Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers 
was reopened Friday after his accuser resurfaced and spoke to authorities 
again. Kim Grant, a 23-year-old worker at Walt Disney World, said 
last month the basketball star grabbed her neck outside Disney's Pleasure 
Island nightclubs after she tried to end a conversation with him. 
Police investigators later tried at least six times to get in touch 
with Grant, by telephone and letter, said Cmdr. Steve Jones, a spokesman 
for the Orange County sheriff's office. When she couldn't be contacted, 
the complaint was shelved. But she came to the sheriff's office Friday. 
She said she hadn't known officials were looking for her until newspapers 
reported last week that her complaint wasn't being processed because 
she couldn't be found. Charges of simple battery will be filed with 
the state attorney's office, Jones said. No one was immediately available 
for comment Friday at Management Plus, which represents O'Neal. But 
his agent, Leonard Armato, said after the complaint was filed that 
the accusations are ``completely false and without factual support.'' 
In her complaint, Grant said she was on duty at the entrance to Disney's 
Pleasure Island when the 7-foot-1 (2.16-meter) center asked her name 
and if she had friends. The woman said the men told her they were 
``going to look for girls,'' and she tried to end the conversation 
with the comment, ``Be my guest.'' At that point, the suit says, O'Neal 
grabbed her by the neck, pulled her to him and said, ``I was just 
playing. Can't you take a joke?'' according to the complaint. O'Neal 
originally played for the Orlando Magic and still owns a home in Isleworth, 
a gated community outside Orlando.
