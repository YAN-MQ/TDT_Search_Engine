The most wanted man in Turkey, Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah 
Ocalan, has been arrested in Rome. Turkey wants him extradited. It 
says Ocalan is a terrorist and shoulders responsibility for the deaths 
of 30,000 people in the last 14 years as the leader of the PKK rebel 
movement. Chris Morris reports. Abdullah Ocalan was arrested on Thursday 
night after arriving in Rome on a flight from Moscow. Turkey is seeking 
extradition on charges of terrorism. But there are bound to be political 
complications. Mr. Ocalan may be a hate figure for most Turks, but 
he remains a hero to many of his Kurdish followers. Nevertheless, 
the Turkish prime minister, Mesut Yilmaz, said the PKK was now without 
its leader. Mr. Ocalan, he said, could no longer control the movement's 
murderous activity. Chris Morris, BBC News, Ankara.
