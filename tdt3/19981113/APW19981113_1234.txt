A busload of Americans on a day trip to Mexico were injured Friday 
when the driver swerved to avoid another accident and the bus flipped 
onto its side. Most of the 32 passengers sustained minor injuries, 
including cuts, bruises and neck and back pain. A dozen were in serious 
condition at Big Bend Regional Medical Center in Alpine, Texas, said 
Mike Cox, a spokesman with the Texas Department of Public Safety. 
Sherry Prewitt, chief nurse executive at the hospital, said three 
or four victims were in critical condition. The accident happened 
about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Ojinaga, U.S. Customs spokesman 
Roger Maier said. The bus may have been headed to Copper Canyon, he 
said. Ms. Prewitt said the driver swerved to avoid an accident on 
the road ahead, glimpsed through rain and fog, and lost control of 
the bus.
