Hello, Mr. Macy. How do I say hello back? For a double dose of Roma, 
she stars with Moira Kelly in "Monday after the miracle," the story 
of Helen Keller and her adoring teacher, annie Sullivan. Their bond 
is jeopardized when a professor, played by Bill Campbell, comes between 
the two women. And this morning, I went into your room and I knew

premieres on CBS.
