Lawyers for Paula Jones have announced a settlement of her case with 
President Clinton following months of negotiations. Her lawyers say 
she's getting $850,000. Steven Sacher has the details. Crucially for 
Mr. Clinton, there was no apology from the president, no admission 
that the alleged sexual assault in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991 
actually took place. The deal means the White House is at last freed 
of the Jones case. But in a sense, the damage has already been done. 
As a result of legal investigations undertaken by her lawyers, Mr. 
Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky was uncovered.
