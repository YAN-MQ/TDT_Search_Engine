It has not been a good day for Hillary Clinton, former government 
official, webster Hubbell. Fraud and perjury related to a land deal 
in Arkansas. One count says that Hubbell sought to cover up the true 
nature of the relationship of one of his law partners with the land 
deal. That law partner was Hillary Clinton. Hubbell said tonight he 
is innocent. There's nothing Starr can do to him to make him lie about 
his friend, Bill and Hillary Clinton. Many thanks. Jackie Judd in 
Washington this evening.
