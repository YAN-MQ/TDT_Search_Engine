Q. I recently switched from a small, hands-on company to a large, 
hierarchical one. Adjusting has been a bit of a struggle. Before, 
I had a say in all aspects of the business, and I saw the impact I 
had. Now, I'm a widget handler and wonder if I am adding any value 
to the company's products. What should I do: stay put and work my 
way up to a position where I'll clearly make a difference, or go back 
to being a big frog in a small pond? A. As far as corporate culture 
shock goes, nothing is quite as depressing as feeling that you've 
signed on to be an inconsequential drone in a giant cubicle hive. 
But before you rush back to your former pasture, make sure you're 
not just suffering from the grass-is-greener syndrome. Compile a list 
of everything you loathed about your old employer and reflect on whether 
the problems were related to the small, entrepreneurial nature of 
the place. (To keep you honest, talk with friends who can remind you 
how you complained while working there.) Try to assemble as complete 
a picture as possible of your personality and work style, advised 
George Zeller, a senior employment specialist with Career Moves, a 
counseling service in Boston. You may even want to take one of those 
personality tests intended to reveal whether you're best equipped 
to be the chief financial officer of a multinational corporation, 
a French teacher or a zookeeper. But don't expect any big revelations, 
Zeller warned. In some ways, these tests just mirror what you already 
know. Still, you might be discovering that you have landed in the 
wrong environment for your personality type. I asked Joseph Frey, 
a clinical psychologist in Augusta, Ga., for the Highlands Program, 
a career development firm, about your case, and he said you sounded 
like a ``structural generalist.'' The ``structural'' part of that 
phrase means that you need a hands-on type of job. You enjoy having 
a product that you can feel, see, or touch at the end of the day. 
But as a generalist, Frey said, you also like being part of a team 
and want a bit of diversity in your workday. Smaller companies are 
ideal environments for structural generalists, Frey said, while large, 
hierarchical firms often force such folks to choose between their 
dominant personality traits. Even if you decide to stay with the larger 
firm, start planning your rise from dronedom. According to Zeller, 
a lot of people just want to get lost and be invisible, so you need 
to make it clear that you are (italics)not(end italics) one of them. 
Volunteer for different assignments. Acquire as many skills and experiences 
as you can. Maintain a diary of your accomplishments. After a while, 
go to the boss and say, ``For the past few months I did this. I did 
that. I went to training and picked up these skills. I helped Sally 
with that project. Now I want to take on a new project.'' Some companies, 
of course, do not allow such cross-pollination among departments or 
positions. In that case, your only option may be to seek a less-rigid 
hive.
