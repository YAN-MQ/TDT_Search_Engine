Youth and resilience were the deciding factors as Mats Wilander edged 
Bjorn Borg Friday in a battle of former World No. 1 players in the 
dlrs 150,000 Delta Airlines ATP Senior Tour of Champions tournament. 
Wilander, 34, exploited the advantage he held over his Swedish compatriot 
in speed, power and agility to win 6-2, 3-6 and 10-6. A five-time 
consecutive champion at Wimbledon, Borg rallied back in the second 
set, lashing out a host of winners, as if to show there was still 
plenty of sting left in his forehand and that he was still far from 
the rust pile. But Wilander, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, was able 
to chase loose balls more aggressively and attack the net with greater 
vigor to wrap up the match against his childhood idol. In the second 
pool of the round-robin tournament, Iranian Mansour Bahrami, who had 
never won a title in his career nor ranked better than 192nd in the 
world, turned on a show against another all-time great, John McEnroe. 
Outclassed 6-1, 6-4, Bahrami imitated the American in his heyday as 
tennis' ``bad boy,'' slamming his racket to the floor and ranting 
about line calls. McEnroe, whose competetitive nature recognizes no 
bounds, refused to be outdone and humored his opponent, imitating 
contemporary stars in their anticipation of a shot or whistling as 
he served aces. A 77-title winner, McEnroe even jumped into the drink 
cooler after a heated exchange of shots. In the opening match, home 
favorite Goran Prpic, who received a wildcard for his debut in the 
event, defeated the oldest player and four-time Grand Slam champion, 
48-year-old Guillermo Vilas, 6-3, 6-4. Henri Leconte and fellow Frenchman 
Guy Forget were to meet in the late match Friday. The winner of each 
pool meets in a final showdown on Monday. The Delta Airways Champions 
is the 14th event on the ATP Tour-sanctioned worldwide senior tennis 
circuit.
