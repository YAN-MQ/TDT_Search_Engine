No one knows more about what Saddam Hussein has in place and where 
than scott ridder, the American Marine who resigned in protest from 
the U.N. inspection team because he believed Saddam was getting away 
with too much. Mr. rider is a consultant. What do they contain and 
where are the targets? They likely consist of the military industrial 
targets and leadership targets. They consist of three categories. 
One would be the command posts, before Saddam Hussein and his leadership 
would retreat to in times of actual conflict. Two, would be the security 
apparatus which protects Saddam Hussein and keeps his regime of terror 
in place. Three, the palaces where Saddam Hussein has constructed 
recently. The idea would be once the bombs have struck, the population 
of Baghdad would wake up and see the symbol of authority destroyed. 
A lot of people are asking what can we expect after a sustained military 
attack? One thing is we've probably telegraphed our punch. As we speak 
right now, the leadership is probably flooe threeing here, to towns 
north of Baghdad and locations south of Baghdad. Likewise, the military 
industrial facilities are being evacuate Ed of the machine tools and 
engineers who run them. So more than likely, the missiles will be 
striking empty facilities. Thank you very much, Scott Ritter tonight.
