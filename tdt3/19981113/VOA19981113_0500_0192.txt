The United States, the world's largest producer of fossil fuel emissions 
has become the latest nation to sign the global warning treaty. But, 
prospects for its early enactment appear to be slim. US representative 
to the United Nations Peter Burley signed the treaty in New York, 
Thursday. The chief US negotiator at the UN conference on climate 
change, in Buenos Aires, Stewart Issenstat said it will serve several 
US goals. We pledged at the conclusion of the Kyoto Conference that 
we would sign this historic agreement and today we will do so. In 
taking this action, the United States reaffirms our commitment to 
work with the nation's gathered here to address the challenge of climate 
change. And we're guided by the firm belief that signing will serve 
our environmental, economic, and national security goals. Last year, 
the US Senate voted to reject any accord that does not require developing 
countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. So far, India 
and China have refused to reduce their emission levels which is likely 
to complicate ratification of the treaty.
