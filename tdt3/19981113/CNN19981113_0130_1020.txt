And Dell is proving to be a juggernaut to the personal computer business. 
After conquering the small business market, the company is now clicking 
with larger customers as well. Bruce Francis reports. There seems 
to be just one challenge that Dell can't overcome -- the soaring expectation 
of investors. Revenues grew 51%, earnings were up 55% and people aren't 
happy? It's amazing the expectations that are built into this stock, 
and it should serve as somewhat of a warning to investors about the 
current level of prices here. Dell is firing on all engines. Even 
sales in Asia rose by 49%. Dell has now sold nearly $17 billion worth 
of computers in the past four quarters, and boasts that it is the 
most profitable PC maker. Internet sales grew to $10 million a day, 
far outpacing the level of any internet retailer. Internet sales are 
now a full 20% of Dell's revenue. Much of that business -- Dell sets 
up customized web pages for companies to order computers. It boasts 
8,500 of those pages so far. A new survey shows that Dell is making 
deeper inroads into lucrative corporate sales, a market that had been 
dominated by Compaq. Traditionally, Dell has done very well within 
smaller and medium business and with the government and education, 
but it has never done as well, has never dominated the very large 
commercial segment. They have now done that and surpassed Compaq. 
Dell's main rival is far from complacent, though. Just this week, 
Compaq stole a page from the Dell playbook, saying that it would sell 
computers directly to small and medium-sized businesses. That's the 
group of customers that first made Dell a success. Bruce Francis,
