The chairman of reigning European champion Real Madrid said Friday 
the club was closer to clinching attacking Liverpool midfielder Steve 
McManaman for a four-season contract. ``Our positions have come closer, 
so much so that a satisfactory resolution to the matter looks likely,'' 
Lorenzo Sanz told the leading Spanish daily El Pais after talks with 
McManaman's agent Colin Gordon on Thursday. Previous negotiations 
this month had stumbled over Real Madrid's opinion that the 26-year-old 
player was asking for too much, El Pais said. The paper added that 
the latest talks indicated such problems had been ironed out. Sanz 
said Real was looking to sign McManaman for four seasons with an option 
on a fifth. There were no details available regarding the financial 
side of the contract. McManaman's contract with Liverpool expires 
in June 1999. The club is expected to offer him an attractive renewal 
deal. But Real Madrid officials say the chances of the midfielder 
leaving have increased because of difficulties at the struggling Premier 
league side, exemplified Thursday by the resignation of co-manager 
Roy Evans. In addition, Madrid believes McManaman would favor a move 
to the Spanish club as he has a bone to pick with Real's eternal rival 
FC Barcelona who, in the last minute, pulled out of negotiations to 
sign him two seasons ago preferring to do a deal with Brazilian Rivaldo. 
Gerard Houllier, who assume sole control as Liverpool manager after 
Evans' departure, said Friday there is little the Reds can do to stop 
McManaman leaving if he wants to. ``I will be sorry if he goes because 
we will miss him,'' he said. ``But you have to admit that he is a 
good player at the club and is going to be a free agent. You have 
to respect what he wants to do. ``Steve has never hidden the fact 
that he wanted at one stage of his career to go abroad, and if he 
finds the opportunity this season, I will feel very sorry for the 
club and I will regret it because I would like him to stay, I want 
him to stay and I will let him know that. ``We are trying hard to 
do so, I don't know whether a deal has been done or not, because he 
can't sign anything until Jan. 1. But if he prefers to go abroad. 
.... you have to accept that and respect it. But I am not resigned 
to him going and we will continue the battle to keep him at the club.''
