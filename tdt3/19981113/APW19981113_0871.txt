Queues of hundreds formed at gas stations and shoppers found some 
prices up in Baghdad's crowded markets Friday amid widening fears 
that a U.S. military strike is imminent. Still, the mood seemed defiant, 
reflecting the Iraqi government's efforts to forge a united front 
against U.N. sanctions imposed eight years ago after it invaded Kuwait. 
``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan, 40, 
as she shopped for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her four children. 
``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.'' Preachers at Friday prayers 
in the nation's mosques called on Arabs and Muslims to rally behind 
Iraq, despite signs of a loss of support in its confrontation over 
U.N. weapons inspections. ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims 
in the world _ to declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif 
Humeim, sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad. 
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.'' ``Do not 
be claws in the hands of Jews and Americans,'' he added. The United 
States and Britain have beefed up their military strength in the Gulf 
and are threatening to attack Iraq to force it to allow inspections 
by the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating 
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The inspectors must certify that 
Iraq has destroyed those weapons before the U.N. Security Council 
will lift the sanctions, which have devastated the Iraqi economy by 
limiting the sale of oil and other trade dealings. U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright said Friday that an attack can be averted 
if Iraq resumes cooperation with the inspectors. ``We are prepared 
to act,'' she said. ``That is our position. No further warnings are 
needed.'' On Thursday, the foreign ministers of six Gulf governments, 
Iraq's most vulnerable neighbors, along with Egypt and Syria called 
for a diplomatic settlement. But they also warned in an unusually 
strong statement that ``the Iraqi government is held responsible for 
any consequences'' if it doesn't back down from its Aug. 5 decision. 
Iraqi newspapers, however, ignored the statement, presenting a far 
different picture to their readers. ``There is condemnation of American 
threats on both Arab and international levels,'' read the banner headline 
of Al-Thawra, the paper published by President Saddam Hussein's ruling 
Baath Party. Despite such rhetoric, there were scattered signs Friday 
that the Iraqi people were beginning to take the threat of attack 
seriously. Long queues formed at gasoline stations as Iraqis filled 
their tanks _ and jerrycans _ with fuel. At one station in the capital, 
about 20 cars were lined up in front of each of its eight pumps. Taxi 
drivers said they didn't want to be caught short if the government 
imposes rationing, as it did during the last standoff over weapons 
inspections in January and February. There also were fears that the 
Americans might bomb refineries, reducing the supply. Western television 
crews and photographers were barred by government ``minders'' from 
the gas stations, and reporters were told they could not interview 
people in the queues. No information was available in Baghdad about 
military preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said 
in a statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north 
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major highways. 
At Baghdad's downtown Shorja market, merchants said some prices had 
increased _ a barometer of anxiety here _ but that they mainly for 
perishable goods such as eggs and fresh milk. Merchants and shoppers 
said an attack was not their first concern. ``Of course we are worried,'' 
said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, as he sold vegetables at Shorja. ``But it's 
not about any kind of aggression. We are all having trouble getting 
enough money to buy food.'' Haidar Saad, 18, a soldier shopping for 
his family, said he didn't expect any panic buying. ``The markets 
have stayed open during past crises,'' he said. ``Anyway, most people 
live on their (government) rations and don't have the money to stockpile 
food.'' The rations are distributed under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food 
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy 
food, medicine and other necessities for its 22 million people. U.N. 
spokesman Eric Falt said Friday that oil was being exported normally 
and that ships carrying Vietnamese rice and Australian wheat were 
being unloaded at the southern Iraqi port of Mina al-Bakr. Since Wednesday, 
the United Nations has pulled out of Iraq all its weapons inspectors 
and a third of the 450 people working on U.N. relief programs because 
of the threatened military strikes.
