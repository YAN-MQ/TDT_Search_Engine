Todd Martin stopped Takao Suzuki's run in the Stockholm Open Friday, 
beating the Japanese qualifier 6-3, 6-4 in the first quarterfinal. 
Martin broke Suzuki twice in game seven and nine to win the first 
set. After trading service breaks early in the second set, Martin 
broke Suzuki again in the last game. Suzuki fell behind 15-40 after 
two superb crosscourt returns by Martin. The American clinched the 
match with a perfect lob. ``The key point of the game came at 15 all 
in the last game, when I hit a passing shot for a winner,'' Martin 
said. ``That gave me a boost and took the wind out of him.'' ``I feel 
I'm playing great, better than a few years ago. That's more than I 
can ask for. I just hope it continues for the rest of the week and 
that it doesn't vanish come 1999.'' Martin, who reached the 1996 Stockholm 
final but lost to Thomas Enqvist, will play the winner between third-seed 
Tim Henman and Magnus Gustafsson in Saturday's semifinal. Suzuki, 
ranked 122nd on the ATP Tour coming into the tournament, reached the 
main draw by winning three qualifying matches last weekend. He upset 
Enqvist, who was the No. 8 seed, in three sets in the first round 
and then beat Kenneth Carlsen in two straight to gain his first quarterfinal 
on the ATP Tour. Before Stockholm, Suzuki had only won two matches 
on the tour since 1996. He won three Challenger tournaments this year 
in the United States. ``He's a very talented player,'' Martin said. 
``He's got a good serve and an incredible volley. He just neds to 
improve his seve a bit to become a great player.'' Fourth-seed Greg 
Rusedski played Daniel Nestor and Jason Stoltenberg, who upset top-ranked 
Pete Sampras in the first round, faced Thomas Johansson in the other 
quarterfinals later Friday.
