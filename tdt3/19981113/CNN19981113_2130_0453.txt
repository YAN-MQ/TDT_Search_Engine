A congressional tradition was fulfilled this morning. The freshmen 
elected to the House of Representatives in this month's midterm election 
gathered on the capitol's steps for their class photo. There are 40 
newcomers to the house, 17 republicans and 23 democrats. The group 
includes six women. The new Congress will be sworn in January 6th. 
Electing a new speaker will be one of the first orders of business.
