Employee incentive plans are not just for motivating top executives 
any more, a new survey has found; they are spreading to cover workers 
on lower rungs of the organizational ladder. But that doesn't necessarily 
mean that the plans are working. The survey of 159 companies, more 
than a third of them in the Fortune 500, found that 72 percent now 
have variable pay plans, up from 47 percent in 1990. Such plans may 
involve cash awards or gifts for individual or team performance on 
specific tasks, or benefits like profit-sharing or stock ownership 
that spread the wealth from companywide success to employees at many 
levels. Eighteen percent of the companies surveyed said they planned 
to expand their plans to include more employees in the next year. 
But only 22 percent of the companies surveyed said their plans had 
helped them achieve all of their business objectives; 28 percent said 
their plans had achieved none of them. What went wrong? According 
to Ken Abosch, a consultant at Hewitt Associates, the Chicago-based 
firm that conducted the survey, plans may fail to deliver on their 
intended goals because employees are not told enough about them and 
are not kept up to date on the plans' progress. Eighty-nine percent 
of companies that regularly communicated with employees said their 
plans had met their goals, versus only 57 percent of companies that 
did not discuss them regularly. There are five keys to a successful 
plan, Abosch said: _ Goals that are clear and are fully supported 
by management. _ Goals that are realistic _ not too difficult or too 
easy to achieve. _ Regular communication with employees about the 
plan. ``People want a scorecard,'' Abosch said. _ Simplicity. ``It 
has to pass the elevator test,'' he said. ``Can you explain it on 
an elevator ride?'' _ Consistency with the company's current goals. 
``There are very few organizations that have the same business objective 
for five to seven years,'' Abosch said. As for pitfalls, Abosch listed 
two: too little oversight and poor plan design. ``The striking thing 
is the number of companies that don't monitor their plans closely,'' 
said Abosch, adding that plans often pay out even when business results 
do not warrant it.
