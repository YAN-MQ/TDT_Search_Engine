Russian and Japanese leaders signed a ``Moscow Declaration'' on Friday 
in which they pledged to seek an end to their 53-year-old dispute 
over the Kuril islands by the end of next year. If they succeed, it 
would mean that Russia and Japan could formally end World War II before 
the end of the 20th century. The dispute over ownership of the tiny 
islands has stopped the two countries from ever signing a formal peace 
treaty. The declaration signed by prime ministers Keizo Obuchi of 
Japan and Yevgeny Primakov of Russia gives no hint of how the conflict 
might be resolved, but sets up a new mechanism _ and a new resolve 
_ for doing it. The declaration was signed at the outset of talks 
between the two premiers that were otherwise expected to focus on 
the details of when and how Japan will hand over an dlrs 800 million 
installment on a loan it promised last summer. On Thursday, Obuchi 
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin ``exchanged views from broad and 
lofty perspectives,'' as Obuchi's spokesman put it, in the first formal 
visit by a Japanese prime minister to the Russian capital in 25 years. 
The spokesman, Sadaaki Numata, observed that it was ``not the sort 
of discussion that might take place between bankers.'' That sort of 
talk was reserved for Friday's meeting between Obuchi and Primakov. 
While the subject of the disputed islands loomed over the talks, the 
leaders were also expected to work out the timing and logistics of 
Japan's loan, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The money is part 
of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package arranged by the International 
Monetary Fund this summer. Both the IMF and the World Bank put their 
loans on hold after Russia effectively defaulted on foreign loans 
at the outset of its economic crisis in August. In addition to agreeing 
to free up the loan, Obuchi has offered to give Russia dlrs 100 million 
to promote economic development on the Kuril islands, dlrs 10 million 
to medical assistance and dlrs 20 million to support youth exchange 
programs. The two prime ministers were expected to sign a spate of 
agreements, including one on guarantees of capital investments that 
is expected to pave the way for large-scale Japanese investment in 
Russia, ITAR-Tass said. They also were expected to sign memorandums 
on cooperation in tourism, transport, mail and telecommunications, 
as well as support for Russia's small- and medium-size companies. 
Relations between the two countries have long been clouded by the 
Kuril dispute. Tokyo claimed title to the islands _ Etorofu, Kunashiri, 
Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty with Russia in 1875. 
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War II, 
a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal. The islands have 
only about 17,000 poor and restive Russian residents, many of whom 
would welcome Japanese administration. The Kurils are important to 
both countries for symbolic reasons and because they are surrounded 
by prime fishing waters.
