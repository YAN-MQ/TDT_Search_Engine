President Clinton has signed legislation that increases sentences 
for committing federal crimes involving the use of a gun. It adds 
seven years to the sentence of a person convicted of possessing a 
Gun while breaking federal law, and adds ten years if the weapon is 
fired. Hours before the legislation was signed, a survey was released 
that concludes guns can be found in 43% of U.S. homes with children. 
In 23% of those households, the guns are kept loaded. The survey was 
conducted for the center to prevent handgun violence.
