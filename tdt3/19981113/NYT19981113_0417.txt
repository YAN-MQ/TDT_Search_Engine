Peter Angelos, who owns 60 percent of the Baltimore Orioles, intends 
to bid on the Washington Redskins and is certain that if he acquires 
the football team, he will meet the National Football League's standards 
for dual ownership of sports franchises. Asked in a telephone interview 
Friday if he would give up ownership of the Orioles in order to acquire 
the Redskins, Angelos said: ``No, I would not. But I don't think that 
question is even applicable. The rule states that in order to own 
a team in another sport, you have to be within the same market area 
as the football franchise.'' The Orioles, Angelos noted, operate within 
a 75-mile radius of the Redskins franchise. The Redskins are owned 
by the estate of the late team owner, Jack Kent Cooke, whose son John 
Kent Cooke is attempting to buy the franchise. Reports have indicated 
others will bid as high as $450 million, and Angelos indicates his 
bid _ which will have the backing of David Bernstein, an Orioles minority 
owner _ will exceed $500 million. Angelos purchased the Orioles in 
August 1993, and since then the franchise, benefiting from the lure 
of the scenic Camden Yards ball park and Angelos' aggressive acquisition 
of players, has become one of the most powerful franchises in baseball. 
After a 13-year dormancy, the Orioles made the playoffs in 1996 and 
1997. Angelos, a plaintiff lawyer, says he has taken ``not one nickel'' 
out of the Orioles, reinvesting all earnings in the team. He indicated 
he would do the same if he owned the Redskins. He wants to buy the 
Redskins, he said, ``because anyone interested in purchasing a sports 
franchise would have to be interested in buying the Redskins.'' Angelos 
added, ``It's a storied franchise, in the nation's capital _ it's 
one of the premier franchises in the NFL, and that automatically would 
make it attractive.''
