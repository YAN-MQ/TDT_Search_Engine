This is Orelon Sidney with your "CNN Headline News Weather" update. 
A strong area of low pressure continues to move across the western 
gulf of mexico on Saturday. That means heavy rain for Texas spreading 
into portions of the Mississippi valley as far north as Kentucky and 
Tennessee. Heaviest rain will still be across portions of Louisiana 
and into the Texas gulf coast. To the west, a strong system will moved 
inland. That means a mix of rain and snow stretching from the northwest 
coast inland to the Rockies of Montana and Idaho. Also, look for a 
strong storm to bring more snowfall to the Great Lakes and stretching 
towards New England. Barrow will be cloudy, look for a high 15 degrees 
on Saturday with Juneau seeing a mix of clouds and sunshine, a high 
of 38 degrees. Temperatures will be in the 30s, 40s and 50s for most 
of the northern U.S. through Saturday with warm temperatures especially 
in the south and the southwest. The extended forecast includes wind, 
rain and thunderstorms for Sunday. We'll see most rain activity moving 
through the Mississippi valley, changing into snowfall across the 
Great Lakes and lingering trough Tuesday. The extended forecast can 
be found at CNN.com.
