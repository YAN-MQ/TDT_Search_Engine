Kate Moss wasn't feeling particularly gorgeous a week ago. In London, 
The Daily Mirror reported that the 105-pound supermodel, her hair 
recently dyed shocking pink for the Donatella Versace fashion show 
in Milan, had booked herself into a (PS)300-a-day rehab clinic. Ms. 
Moss, 24, was quoted as saying she was exhausted from working and 
partying too much, and wanted to reassess her life. Excessive use 
of hair dye and other substances may well be the reality of supermodeldom, 
but fashion doesn't want to hear it. Particularly not this season. 
The hand-lettered sign backstage at the Michael Kors show in Bryant 
Park on Nov. 4 made that clear. ``Be very fresh and very upbeat,'' 
it instructed the models, many of them clad in taffeta, just before 
they hit the runway. ``Happy and sunny as always,'' it said. ``Strong 
and energetic. Casual yet sexy. You're gorgeous. We love you! Have 
a great show!'' Such cheerfulness is what fashion is all about now 
_ dolling up, not drying out. For spring, clothes are as saucy as 
Bill Blass' black lace cargo pants or Marc Jacobs' scallop-edged leather 
skirts, the models as scrubbed as anyone in J. Crew's pages. The program 
notes for the Tuleh collection by Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley said 
it best. ``Dream. Laugh. Conquer. Gamble. Be pretty,'' they urged 
all who made the trek to the unglamorous environs of 18th Street and 
10th Avenue for the show on Nov. 5. With words like ``pretty'' and 
``upbeat,'' fashion has completed its about-face from the minimalism 
and moroseness of recent years, eschewing heroin chic for heroine 
chic. Models even dared to smile on the catwalks this season, if only 
for the finales of shows. Much to the relief of women everywhere, 
sequins are no longer verboten. It's OK to look like you spent a million 
bucks to look like a million bucks. An aspirational quality has returned 
to clothes and to fashion advertising. You can wear pink and still 
be a player. It's all posturing, of course, but at least it's perky. 
To be sure, there were some beautiful clothes on the New York runways. 
But amid all the calculated levity, something was missing. Among the 
majors, there was little fashion for fashion's sake. Now that Isaac 
Mizrahi has closed his business and Todd Oldham has shut down his 
wholesale operation, there wasn't much on the runways to fuel the 
imagination. Badgley Mischka trucked in a grassy lawn upon which to 
show its confectionary evening wear (``You could smell the dirt,'' 
one editor said, favorably recapping the show), but otherwise, there 
wasn't much in the way of showmanship. Like Bob Mackie at his glitziest 
in the 1980s, Mizrahi and Oldham could, for much of the '90s, be counted 
on to send their audiences out on a cloud. They didn't necessarily 
make you want to buy their clothes _ not every woman needs Hollywood 
glamour or thrift-store chic to shop at Gristede's. But these men 
made you excited about fashion. To use a word from Simon Doonan's 
new book, ``Confessions of a Window Dresser'' they ``szhooshed'' up 
a week of shows. In so doing, they served a vital function from which 
more commercial designers undoubtedly benefited. The ne plus ultra 
of the current fashion season is generally considered to be Yohji 
Yamamoto's show held last month in Paris. For the finale, his brides 
peeled off layer after layer of clothes to reveal ever more stunning 
creations underneath, glamorous ecdysiasts shucking hoop skirts and 
polka dot petticoats until they reached the slimmest of silhouettes. 
Suzy Menkes, the longtime fashion critic of The International Herald 
Tribune, called it ``the most elegant striptease at the Moulin Rouge'' 
and ``one of those fashion moments that holds the audience spellbound.'' 
Those moments are few and far between, of course. Not every show can 
be John Galliano's Russian princesses-escaping-the-palace thriller, 
Alexander McQueen's Joan of Arc extravaganza or the time Jean-Paul 
Gaultier's models didn't walk a runway but rose, perfectly posed, 
from trap doors in the floor. But designers need to try for something 
more than nice frocks on happy models. They need to make audiences 
scream with delight sometimes, to make their customers want to spend 
the rent money on clothes they don't need. With each runway show, 
they need to create a world in which people want to live, a world 
so mesmerizing they forget about troop mobilizations, abortion doctor 
assassinations and even, for a moment, supermodels in rehab.
