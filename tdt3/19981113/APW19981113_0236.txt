Israeli warplanes blasted suspected guerrilla hideouts in southern 
Lebanon on Friday in the sixth such attack in as many days, security 
officials said. Four hours later, Israeli gunners fired a mortar into 
a nearby village, wounding a teen-ager, the officials said. It was 
not clear what prompted the shelling on Arab Saleem village. The officials 
said two Israeli jets fired four missiles at the abandoned village 
of Aqmata in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces an 
Israeli-occupied border enclave in southern Lebanon.
