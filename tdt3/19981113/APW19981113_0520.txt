Fearing U.S. airstrikes, thousands of Iraqis queued up outside gasoline 
stations Friday as Iraq's official media ignored the evident loss 
of Arab support in its confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections. 
Official newspapers published articles hailing President Saddam Hussein's 
decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, 
and claimed there was worldwide condemnation of American threats. 
The United States has beefed up its military strength in the Gulf 
and is threatening to launch airstrikes in a bid to force Iraq to 
allow inspections by the Special Commission, which is responsible 
for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. ``The world calls 
for dialogue and peace and America seeks war and aggression,'' the 
official al-Iraq newspaper said. ``There is condemnation of American 
threats on both Arab and international levels,'' al-Thawra, the mouthpiece 
of the ruling Baath party newspaper, said in a banner headline. The 
newspapers made no mention of the warning issued to Iraq Thursday 
by six Gulf Arab countries _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _ along with 
Syria and Egypt. They called for ``wisdom and reason'' to end the 
confrontation but said Saddam's government alone would be ``responsible 
for any consequences'' from its stopping the weapons inspectors' work. 
At a news conference Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said 
if the Arab countries are sincere about resolving the crisis, ``they 
should blame the main block ... the United States.'' Hours later, 
Iraqi newspapers Friday claimed Iraq was capable of defeating the 
United States. During a Friday prayer sermon at a Baghdad mosque, 
a cleric urged Arabs and Muslims to ``declare war on America'' and 
rally behind Iraq. Friday sermons are usually screened by the government. 
``I call upon you ... do not let their aeroplanes use your airspace 
or bases. Do not give them any facilities,'' said the preacher, Abdullatif 
Humeim. An opposition party in exile said in a statement received 
in Cairo, Egypt that Iraqi security forces have fanned out in various 
cities and are taking control of major roads. Night patrols have intensified, 
said the statement by the Iraqi Communist Party. The report could 
not be independently verified in Baghdad. The feeling of an imminent 
strike was evident from the rush to fill up gasoline. At one station, 
about 20 cars were queued up in front of each of its eight pumps. 
Iraqi officials escorting journalists said it was forbidden to take 
pictures or talk to the people at the gas station. A customer contacted 
later said he waited a half-hour to fill up his car. ``I fear the 
Americans will hit refineries and there will be a shortage of fuel,'' 
said the driver who did not wish to be identified. Markets in Baghdad 
were crammed, but the crowd comprised the usual weekend shoppers. 
At the Al-Shorja market, 40-year-old Naima Aidan said she was buying 
coconut and sugar to make sweets for her four children. ``I am not 
worried. I don't think anything will happen to us. Because God will 
keep us safe,'' she said. Since Wednesday, the United Nations has 
pulled out of Iraq all its weapons inspectors and one-third of the 
450 people working on the humanitarian programs. UNSCOM chief Richard 
Butler called it ``a very serious confrontation'' and said diplomatic 
solutions seem remote. ``There's a growing sense that airstrikes or 
enforcement is becoming more and more likely,'' he told MSNBC television 
on Thursday night. Iraq says it is will cooperate with arms inspectors 
only if the U.N. Security Council guarantees that it will work to 
lift economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
The sanctions cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq 
has destroyed its illegal weapons. Aziz has said that U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan was ``the best person'' to try to ease the current crisis. 
But Annan says he has no plans to visit Baghdad as he did in February 
when he resolved the last crisis.
