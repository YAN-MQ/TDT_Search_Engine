The United Nations security council is scheduled to meet again tomorrow 
to resume discussions about the stand-off with Iraq. After the council 
adjourned tonight, U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan indicated there 
is no support for granting Iraq any concessions. He again appealed 
to Baghdad to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors before 
it's too late. Let me say that I've had a very constructive and useful 
discussions with council members. All stress the desirability of a 
peaceful and diplomatic solution, but events on the ground may be 
running away from us. I don't know.
