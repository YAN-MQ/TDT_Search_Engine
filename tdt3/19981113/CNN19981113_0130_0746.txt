The day's top stories are next. And then in "Dollars & Sense" -- Dell 
surpasses expectations in the highly competitive personal computer 
business. Do you know me? Probably not. I became a card member forty 
years ago. I was starting a winery and traveled to France. Do you 
really have to go? I used my card to stay longer. That business trip 
turned into a honeymoon. And even in the worst of times... this is 
American express. They've been there. We have found a way to get you 
out. Even helped me buy a sports franchise. What do you think? Not 
bad for the first forty years. The difference is membership. My dad 
works for international paper. He makes orange juice cartons so the 
orange juice can stay fresh longer. I think fresh orange juice makes 
you feel better. I think my dad plays a trick on orange juice. He 
makes it think that it's still an orange. International paper. Answering 
citrus producers' needs, and yours.
