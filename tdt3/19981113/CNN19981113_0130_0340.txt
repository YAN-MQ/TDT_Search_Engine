President Clinton says Americans should not have to choose between 
obligations at home and obligations at work. At a White House ceremony 
Thursday, he announced new steps to improve child care, including 
more money for after-school programs. 183 communities in 44 states 
and the district of Columbia can receive $16 million to set up such 
programs. Mr. Clinton says that means 75,000 more children will have 
a place to go when school lets out.
