Leaders of the pilots' union at Federal Express Corp. said Friday 
that the company had rebuffed its latest effort to restart contract 
negotiations, greatly increasing the chances that the pilots will 
strike during the peak holiday-package shipping season next month. 
``We tried to extend the olive branch,'' said union vice president 
Byron Cobb. ``They grasped it and hit us over the head with it.'' 
The union said it would ask Fedex to submit to binding arbitration 
in a final attempt to avert a strike that could hurt many businesses 
around the country, some severely. But the leading express delivery 
company said the union had declined its offer of binding arbitration 
when talks began in July, and that now it was too late. ``Arbitration 
at this time would be unfair to Fedex and its other employees and 
inappropriate given the history of negotiations,'' Fedex said. The 
latest developments put the union and company back on a road toward 
confrontation, a day after many analysts and industry executives were 
becoming optimistic that an agreement would be reached before the 
holidays. Thursday, after days of increasingly tough talk by the company 
and the union, the pilots sent the company a new proposal in a bid 
to restart negotiations. Talks have been stalled since Oct. 30, when 
Fedex withdrew its last offer. The pilots said they were willing to 
compromise their pay demands, including a one-time retroactive payment 
that would raise the base pay of each pilot before new wage increases 
would be applied. But Friday, they said, the company responded by 
demanding that the union's governing board of directors send the new 
agreement to the rank and file with their full endorsement. The board 
refused. A Fedex spokesman said the union had never submitted a a 
comprehensive written contract proposal, as the company had requested, 
and that Fedex had simply asked the union for clarification of its 
offer. Since the talks broke down, the company has moved aggressively 
to reconfigure its operations so that it is less reliant on the pilots. 
It has leased outside airplanes and made plans to divert more deliveries 
to trucking subsidiaries owned by FDX Corp., the holding company that 
also owns Fedex. Two Wall Street analysts who follow Fedex said the 
company had too many planes and might be taking advantage of the impasse 
with the pilots to accelerate its plans to move more transport capacity 
to the ground, which is much less expensive than air. ``I'm really 
starting to think they want a strike now,'' said one of the analysts 
who requested anonymity. Greg Rossiter, a Fedex spokesman, disagreed. 
``We would love to have an agreement, but we have had to make contingency 
plans to protect our customers,'' he said. The pilots, too, said they 
were now convinced that the company wanted a confrontation. Cobb predicted 
80 percent of the pilots would authorize a strike when the votes are 
counted Dec. 3. ``The pilots will not take a concessionary contract,'' 
he said. ``They will not take a contract that is considered lukewarm.''
