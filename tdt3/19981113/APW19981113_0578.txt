Two days of local and Senate elections began Friday in the Czech Republic, 
testing the nation's political stability after this year's leftward 
shift in the government. No dramatic changes are expected, but the 
voting for the upper chamber of parliament are a test of support for 
Prime Minister Milos Zeman's government. Following two years of political 
deadlock, the country's June general election produced a one-party 
minority government of Social Democrats. Zeman's Cabinet survived 
in parliament thanks to a stability pact struck with the runner-up, 
the center-right Civic Democratic Party of former Premier Vaclav Klaus. 
The deal with its former rival was criticized as an attempt to install 
a two-party system and obliterate smaller parties. Voters Friday and 
Saturday are electing more than 60,000 local officials and 27 senators 
in the 81-seat upper chamber of the Czech legislature. Pollsters expect 
50 percent of the 8 million registered voters to turn out. Independent 
candidates are expected to dominate local elections, which have little 
bearing on the balance of political power in the country. Final results 
from the local races are expected Tuesday. Favored candidates in the 
27 Senate races come from the two biggest parties, who are expected 
to maintain their constitutional three-fifths majority. They would 
lose that key advantage only if they drop 16 of the contests to their 
main challengers, the four-party ad hoc coalition led by Christian 
Democrats and the center-right Freedom Union favored by President 
Vaclav Havel. The Senate races will see few if any outright winners 
in the first round, with none of the 136 candidates expected to receive 
the required 50 percent majority. The two top vote-getters from any 
undecided race will advance to a second-round showdown next Friday 
and Saturday, with a simple majority required.
