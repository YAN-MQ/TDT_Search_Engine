Most Iraqis appear to be supporting their government's defiance of 
the United Nations. Muslim preachers rallied the faithful in Baghdad 
today, criticizing the United States for its aggressive stance against 
their country. Christiane Amanpour has more. If the Iraqi people are 
praying for delive rans, it's hard to see where that would come from. 
Even Russia, a friend who has gotten Iraq out of my similar scrapes, 
says events are spinning out of control. The Russian ambassador handed 
a letter to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and after that, Tariq Aziz told CNN that Russia, France, 
and China are working hard to find a way out. Daily newspapers in 
Iraq report all sorts of international reaction, but not the fact 
that a host of Arab nations are criticizing Saddam Hussein, saying 
that he will be blamed for the consequences unless he resumed cooperation 
with the U.N. weapons inspectors. After so many of these crises, the 
people here are fatalistic. I haven't taken any precautions. We're 
not afraid of their threats. Once, twice, or three times, we're used 
to it. U.N. officials are taking precautions. Those who remain are 
converting offices into temporary sleeping quarters as they try to 
keep food and medical aid going to the people. We are trying to do 
work that has nothing to do with politics, but something to do with 
meeting basing needs of people. The whole program could now be in 
jeopardy. The latest to withdraw are independent inspectors who have 
to certify the arrival of food and medicine in Iraq before it can 
be paid for and deliberated to those in need. There is no public sign 
talks are working. But Saddam Hussein said he would agree to a new 
initiative on his terms, one that takes into account the desire for 
sanctions rereview. Christiane Amanpour, Baghdad.
