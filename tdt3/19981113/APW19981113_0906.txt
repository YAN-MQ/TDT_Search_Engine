With strikers Alessandro Del Piero and Pierluigi Casiraghi sidelined 
for months with severe knee injuries, Italy's coach Dino Zoff called 
a trio of young forwards _ Filippo Inzaghi, Francesco Totti and Nicola 
Ventola _ for Wednesday's soccer exhibition against Spain. Ventola, 
Totti and Inzaghi, aged between 21 and 25, have played only portions 
of games with the national team so far. The list of 20 did not include 
veteran star-forward Roberto Baggio, in questionable form following 
a knee injury, and Italy's World Cup keeper Gianluca Pagliuca, sacked 
by Zoff despite his impressive performances with Inter Milan this 
season. Christian Panucci, who plays in Spain with Real Madrid, was 
the only expatriate called by Zoff, who succeeded Cesare Maldini at 
the helm of the ``Azzurri'' last summer. Italy-Spain, between two 
early losers at France '98, will be played in Salerno, near Naples. 
The Arechi stadium of Salerno was the scene of the explosion which 
injured a Belgian off-field official during a UEFA Cup game between 
Fiorentina and Grasshoppers last week. Italy's roster (clubs in parentheses): 
Goalies: Gianluigi Buffon (Parma); Angelo Peruzzi (Juventus). Defenders: 
Fabio Cannavaro (Parma); Giuseppe Favalli (Lazio); Mark Iuliano and 
Gianluca Pessotto (Juventus); Christian Panucci (Real Madrid); Moreno 
Torricelli (Fiorentina); Paolo Maldini (AC Milan). Midfielders: Demetrio 
Albertini (AC Milan); Jonathan Bachini (Udinese); Eusebio Di Francesco, 
Damiano Tommasi and Luigi Di Biagio (AS Roma); Diego Fuser and Dino 
Baggio (Parma). Forwards: Enrico Chiesa (Parma); Filippo Inzaghi (Juventus); 
Francesco Totti (AS Roma); Nicola Ventola (Internazionale).
