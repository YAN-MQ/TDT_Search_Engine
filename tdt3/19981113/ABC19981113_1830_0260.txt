If the U.S. does attack Iraq, it will have several objectives. And 
for the military planners, selecting the targets has very much to 
do with the goal they have in mind. If, for example, one goal is to 
separate and isolate Saddam Hussein from the apparatus that helps 
him maintain such an iron grip on the country, that is one set of 
targets. In that case, we asked John McWethy at the Pentagon, what 
would they attack? They were loading cruise missiles onto B-52s the 
U.S. may soon be using these to weaken Saddam Hussein's grip on power. 
If threatening his personal security is a goal, then the U.S. could 
target the special security service, or sss, run by Saddam Hussein's 
younger son, qusay. It has offices inside the presidential palace 
and two large buildings elsewhere in downtown Baghdad. The organization 
guards Saddam's every move and allegedly coordinates concealment of 
chemical and biological weapons programs. If blocking his ability 
to spy on his own people is a goal, then bombing Al rashidya, just 
outside Baghdad, is an option. That's where the headquarters for a 
special part of Iraq's intelligence agency is located. It monitors 
the country's telephones, intercepting international calls, listening 
to conversations of its own people for indications of dissent. If 
shaking his broader security operation is a goal, then the U.S. could 
hit special republican guard battalions in and around Baghdad. The 
elite force includes 26,000 soldiers who guard Saddam Hussein's palaces 
and they are strategically located near the main roads into Baghdad. 
So intensive strikes over a matter of days would do very serious damage. 
Serious damage, perhaps. But knocking Saddam Hussein from power, that's 
a very different proposition. Pentagon officials say if 49,000 bombing 
missions during the 44-day air campaign of the gulf war did not do 
it, then it is doubtful what is being planned this time will. John 
McWethy, ABC News, the Pentagon.
