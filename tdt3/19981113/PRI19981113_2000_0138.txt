There has been more violence in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Security 
forces have fired tear gas and rubber-coated bullets at tens of thousands 
of protesters. At least six people are reported killed. Jonathan Head 
was there. The boulevard which runs through the heart of Jakarta became 
a battleground between thousands of students and the Indonesian armed 
forces. The amount of fire power used by the soldiers was astounding. 
For several hours, they fired almost continuous deafening barrages 
at the student lines. Many of the shots went over the heads of the 
protesters. Many were blank. But I watched soldiers shooting people 
at close range with rubber-coated bullets, and those who fell did 
not get up. Jonathan Head, BBC News, Jakarta.
