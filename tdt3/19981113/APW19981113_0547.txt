International officials on Friday warned that the failed economic 
recovery and persistent harassment of local Serbs in a formerly Serb-held 
region of Croatia as obstacles to peace and reconciliation there. 
The group of foreign ambassadors and other diplomats visited the region 
known as Eastern Slavonia on Thursday as part of an ongoing progress 
report its status since peacefully returning to Croatian rule last 
January. Once a rich agricultural area, Eastern Slavonia remains largely 
devastated; thousands of Serbs have left, fearing or already facing 
evictions by returning Croats, who were expelled from there by Serbs 
in 1991. Croats are also reluctant to come back to the ruins. In their 
statement, the officials said Eastern Slavonia ``remains economically 
moribund and severely handicapped in sustaining ethnic Serb and Croat 
returns alike.'' ``The poor state of the local economy must also be 
seen as a major factor contributing to the troubling, continuous exodus 
of Serbs from the region,'' it said. Croatia argues it cannot revive 
the region without help from abroad. Western governments, however, 
say they have already invested substantial resources in Eastern Slavonia. 
Hoping to gather some of the estimated dlrs 2.5 billion needed to 
reconstruct the region, Croatia is organizing a donors conference 
to be held in Zagreb on Dec. 4-5. But international officials warned 
money alone will not bring prosperity back. They said economic development 
must be void of ethnic discrimination, and hiring practices favoring 
Croats must cease to exist. The report said security in the region 
was ``relatively good,'' although reports of harassment of Serbs ``continue 
to be numerous,'' increasing the feeling of insecurity among the local 
Serbs. The officials protested against the practice of local authorities 
to force the eviction of Serbs who live in the houses of Croat returnees, 
while they are not as swift to evict Croats who live in Serb houses 
elsewhere in Croatia. They also noted that both Serbs and Croats have 
been using national symbols ``for divisive, political purposes,'' 
and insisted that should stop.
