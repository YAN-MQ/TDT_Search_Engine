Dean Johnson, lead singer of the Velvet Mafia, sauntered into Bowery 
Bar on Tuesday night, brushed past Isaac Mizrahi and ran a gauntlet 
of kisses from doormen, friends and people he said he did not know 
at all. Despite the outpouring of affection, Johnson looked chagrined. 
``Being recognized makes me feel panicked,'' he said. The musician, 
37, should be used to the attention. While he has yet to achieve the 
commercial appeal of, say, Marilyn Manson, he has been a downtown 
fixture since the early '80s. Below 14th Street, the bald, 6-foot-6 
cross-dressing neo-glam rocker is pretty much impossible not to notice. 
Still, surrounded by the conventionally handsome, well-chiseled partiers 
at Beige, Bowery Bar's weekly party for gay men, Johnson confessed 
to feeling out of his element. He elbowed his way through the muscled 
throng and sought refuge in a semicircular booth that afforded an 
unobstructed view of the go-go boys dancing on raised platforms. ``I'm 
too old for this,'' he groaned, tossing back a shot of Cuervo, chased 
by a swig of Heineken. His friends, most of them from the old days 
when Johnson used to step out in high heels to clubs like Area, agreed. 
These days, when Johnson goes out, he's more likely to wear sweat 
pants, a black T-shirt and combat boots. ``I don't do drag unless 
I'm getting paid,'' he said, his baritone cutting through the din. 
``Most of the time, I dress like a shlub.'' Just then a man squeezed 
by his chair and shouted, ``I used to know you 15 years ago.'' Johnson 
rolled his eyes and said, ``You're dating yourself.'' He doesn't need 
reminders of how long he has been toiling on the margins of success. 
``At this point in my life, I should have a house or something, not 
some tiny studio with three cats,'' said Johnson, who gets by with 
gigs at CBGB and sales of his latest CD, ``We Know Where You Live.'' 
At midnight, Johnson had had enough and fled the club. But instead 
of seeking solace at home with his kitties, he headed westward to 
Jackie 60, the gender-bending dance club on Washington Street. ``These 
are my people,'' he said, walking through the door. The evening's 
theme was ``Dental Domination,'' and on stage were a pair of dancers 
dressed as sadistic hygienists. Johnson, who occasionally performs 
at Jackie 60, seemed to know just about everyone. Fortified by free 
drinks, Johnson settled in with his friends and began to relax. Tina 
Paul, a photographer, talked about the first time she glimpsed Johnson, 
in the cult film ``Mondo New York.'' ``It's incredible how little 
he's aged,'' she said, snapping a few pictures of him. Johnson said 
he thought clubbing kept him looking young. ``I guess it helps you 
avoid the sunlight,'' he added. Deirdre Keaveney, an artist, and her 
fiance, Ron Bloodsucker, lead singer of ``Bloodsuckers From Outer 
Space,'' reminisced about their club-hopping nights which often ended 
at dawn. Bloodsucker, who wore a stetson and Ziggy Stardust makeup, 
shook his head. ``I just don't have the energy anymore,'' he said. 
Johnson agreed, even as he looked at his watch, noticed that it was 
nearly 2 and ordered another drink.
