Marijuana as medicine may not be as effective as some advocates would 
have you believe. Researchers at the medical college of Georgia found 
a person with glaucoma would have to smoke a marijuana cigarette every 
two hours to get any medical benefit. That's roughly 4,000 cigarettes 
a year. Supporters say if there's any pain relief, even temporary, 
it's valuable. Joining us now on the phone is Dr. Keith green, an 
ophthalmologist at the medical college of Georgia. Thanks for speaking 
with us, Dr. green. You're welcome. So the effects last a total of 
four hours? That's the length. The maximum is two hours. So if you 
want to maintain the pressure at a nice, healthy pressure to control 
it all the time, you have to smoke a marijuana cigarette about every 
two hours. Is smoking the best system to deliver the chemical? Yes, 
but considering the area of the lung you have to use to absorb the 
drug, you can have other lung problems. And there are readily available 
drugs that are as or more effective? Indeed. Are Pot advocates just 
blowing smoke? I don't know. I think, in a word, yes. You often read 
in the news and see in the newspapers and magazines that I take marijuana 
to relieve the symptoms of glaucoma, and yet there are no symptoms. 
It's a silent sdz that simply causes blindness? How about AIDS patients? 
They claim it overcomes the loss of appetite. There may be some use 
there, because it can be used over a short interval, but for glaucoma 
there is no merit at all. Who funded the study? Two sources. Thank 
you.
