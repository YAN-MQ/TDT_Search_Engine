A regiment of Russia's strategic nuclear forces will be equipped with 
the new Topol-M ballistic missile before the end of the year, according 
to a news report Friday. Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, commander of 
the Strategic Rocket Troops, told a meeting of his command that the 
regiment will be equipped with 10 of the new missiles, the Interfax 
news agency reported. He said six missiles have been tested by the 
force. The Topol-M is the first new ballistic nuclear missile to be 
deployed by Russia in several years and it is intended to form the 
country's main nuclear deterrent. It is a relatively small, rugged 
missile designed to be fired from trucks or other vehicles, making 
it difficult for potential enemies to succeed with a first strike 
in a nuclear confrontation. The missile force has been struggling 
to maintain its effectiveness at a time when the military lacks funds 
and equipment because of the country's economic crisis. The force's 
older missiles are wearing out rapidly and only a few Topols have 
been built as replacements. Russian military commanders have devoted 
much of their limited funding to maintaining the nuclear forces, one 
of the few factors that boosts Moscow's claim to be a global power. 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government insists more money must 
be found to modernize the nuclear forces despite the economic crisis. 
Yakovlev said the rocket troops are still a reliable force and had 
made progress in prolonging the service life of older generation missiles. 
``The strategic rocket troops are maintaining full defense capacity 
and are ready to implement any military tasks at any time and to any 
extent,'' he was quoted as saying.
