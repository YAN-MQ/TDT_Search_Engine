The Dutch government said Friday it will prosecute retailers who sell 
the violent computer game Carmageddon II to children under age 16. 
Justice Minister Benk Korthals said Dutch law did not empower him 
to totally ban the controversial game, which simulates a car rampaging 
through city streets. Points are awarded for running over pedestrians 
_ including children and the elderly _ and mowing down animals. Christian 
Democrat lawmakers in parliament had asked Korthals to investigate 
if he could ban the game, which went on sale Friday for the first 
time in the Netherlands. The game's packaging already clearly advises 
retailers that the game should not be sold to under-16s, the Justice 
Ministry said. The government's prosecution threat is intended to 
reinforce that message. Carmageddon II retails for 99.95 guilders 
(dlrs 53) in Dutch stores.
