Police said Friday they have seized hundreds of kilos of cocaine from 
Colombia, hashish from Morocco and locally made XTC pills with a combined 
street value of some dlrs 30 million. Three Belgians and five Dutch 
nationals appeared in court in this northeastern Belgian town charged 
with drug trafficking after justice officials held a press conference 
showing off their catch. Eight others, including several British nationals 
and a Norwegian, still await to be formally charged. Karel Cleeren, 
a spokesman for the Hasselt prosecutor's office, said police seized 
180 kilos of Colombian cocaine stuffed in containers that arrived 
at the port of Antwerp. The first such shipment was discovered Aug. 
21. Police have also seized 950 kilos of hashish from Morocco and 
100,000 amphetamine pills produced in Belgium. Cleeren put the street 
value of the drugs at about 1 billion Belgian francs (dlrs 28.6 million). 
The cocaine alone was of such good quality, he told reporters that 
its value alone was almost 600 million francs (dlrs 17 million).
