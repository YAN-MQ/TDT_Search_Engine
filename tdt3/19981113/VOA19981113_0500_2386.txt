The United States signed the United Nations Convention on Climate 
Change, the Kyoto Protocol, in New York, Thursday. VOA's United Nations 
Correspondent, Max Rustin reports. US officials say they hope Washington's 
signing of the treaty will encourage other countries, particularly 
developing nations, to back the protocol. They say such backing is 
a requirement the US Senate has set for the treaty to be ratified. 
Parties to the treaty agree to take action to reduce current and future 
emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming or so called 
greenhouse gas. Scientist say high levels of carbon dioxide trigger 
extreme weather events and high temperatures. Industrialized nations 
are currently the biggest producers of greenhouse gas, but emissions 
from key developing nations, including China and India, are expected 
to surpass those of developed nations in about two decades. US Ambassador 
to the United Nations Peter Burley spoke about the issue after signing 
the treaty at UN headquarters in New York. We recognize that further 
work needs to be done in a number of areas, including participation 
by key developing countries, and defining the rules and guidelines 
of measures, such as international trading and the clean development 
mechanism. By signing the protocol, we insure our ability to continue 
playing a strong role in completing the work in these important areas. 
In the United States, opponents of the treaty say, not enough progress 
has been made in securing commitments from developing nations to reduce 
emissions. They say that the treaty, which came out of last year's 
meeting on climate change in Kyoto, Japan will only be effective if 
it receives universal support. Max Ruston, VOA News, United Nations. 
The Global Warming Treaty faces tough opposition though, when it moves 
to the US Congress for ratification.
