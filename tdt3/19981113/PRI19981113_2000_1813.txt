For The World, I'm Derek Stothel in the BBC newsroom in London. Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein is tonight offering his first olive branch in 
the standoff over UN weapons inspections. He says he wants a diplomatic 
solution if sanctions are lifted. But with U.S. forces continuing 
their build-up in the Gulf, President Clinton says only a drastic 
reversal by Iraq can resolve the crisis. None of us can tolerate an 
Iraq free to develop weapons of mass destruction with impunity. Saddam 
Hussein has it within his hands to end this crisis now by resuming 
full cooperation with UNSCOM.
