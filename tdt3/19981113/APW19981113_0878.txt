Police intervened Friday to end a 73-day sit-in by illegal immigrants 
at a town hall east of Paris where they have been demanding that the 
government reconsider their residency requests. Riot police and firefighters 
raided the town hall in Limeil-Brevannes where 11 immigrants, from 
the west African country of Mali, had been allowed to stage their 
protest by Socialist Mayor Joseph Rossignol. The protesters have refused 
to eat for 73 days, but have been taking vitamins and sugar. Friday's 
intervention was ordered by the local police chief, the town hall 
press office said. Immigrants and their supporters have staged marches, 
hunger strikes, church sit-ins and other protests over the past months 
to press France's leftist government to let thousands of mainly African 
immigrants remain. But after legalizing 76,000 people, the government 
rejected residency requests for more than 64,000 others. Some leftists 
have criticized Prime Minister Lionel Jospin as being too tough on 
immigration, while the far-right National Front has criticized him 
as being too soft. The Front blames immigrants for high crime and 
unemployment. Also Friday, demonstrators jumped onto train lines in 
northern Paris at Charles de Gaulle airport to block a train in which 
an Algerian illegal immigrant was being escorted out of the country. 
The immigrant was being sent to Marseille where he was then to take 
a ferry back to Algeria. Police clashed with the demonstrators who 
threw a banner on the train lines saying, ``In favor of welcoming 
and protecting Algerians.'' After the police intervened to disperse 
the protesters, the train left for Marseille without further delay.
