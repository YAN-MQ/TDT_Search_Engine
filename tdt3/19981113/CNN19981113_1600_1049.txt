Dell computer, along with other pcmakers, are predicting a strong 
holiday shopping season. Today, one economic report indicated they 
have reason to be optimistic. Overall retail sales jumped 1% last 
month, with a surge in auto buying leading the way. Wholesale prices, 
meanwhile, edged up 0.2%, a bit more than economists had predicted.

issue is little changed now -- the yield at 5.25%.
