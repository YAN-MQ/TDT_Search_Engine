Nearly half of Greeks need help to fill out a form or understand simple 
written instructions, according to a nationwide survey reported Friday. 
These levels are ``much higher'' than most other European countries, 
said Gerasimos Tsiokos, head of the education ministry's illiteracy 
department, which co-sponsored the study. ``They were given simple 
tests like adding two figures or understanding an electricity bill, 
and they could not do this they are functionally illiterate,'' Tsiokos 
said. The study found that while about 4 percent of Greeks were totally 
illiterate, about 45 percent were functionally illiterate. Most left 
school before completing the mandatory nine years of attendance. The 
need to go out to work was the reason most commonly given for failing 
to finish basic schooling. The survey was conducted this summer by 
a polling company and involved more than 5,000 Greeks aged 15 and 
over who said Greek was their mother tongue. No margin of error was 
given.
