Seventy-five years after Babe Ruth hit the first home run at Yankee 
Stadium, the ball soared again _ this time in bidding at a sports 
memorabilia auction. The ball, discovered in a New Jersey attic two 
years ago, was sold for a record dlrs 126,500 early Friday. Mike Heffner, 
managing director of Leland's Auctions, said the buyer _ who made 
the winning bid by telephone _ did not want to be identified. ``Obviously, 
it was worth it,'' Heffner said. ``It's the best baseball we've ever 
sold and the price showed it.'' The previous record for a baseball 
was dlrs 93,500 for the ball that went through Bill Buckner's legs, 
allowing the New York Mets to beat the Boston Red Sox in Game 6 of 
the 1986 World Series, which they eventually won. That ball was bought 
by actor Charlie Sheen in 1992. Mark Scala, a graphic designer from 
Ramsey, New Jersey, found the Ruth ball two years ago in the attic 
of his grandmother's house in Irvington, New Jersey. After Scala's 
son, Chris, dressed up as Ruth for a school project on famous Americans, 
87-year-old Viola Bevilacque remembered the ball that was given to 
her husband as a prize in 1927 for making the New Jersey all-state 
high school team. The ball, hit by Ruth on Yankee Stadium's opening 
day in 1923, was kept in the attic of the house she has lived in since 
1946. Scala played in that attic as a youngster, among old clothes 
and cartons, never realizing the treasure in one old box with some 
other long-discarded baseballs. When he found out about the ball, 
which was signed by Ruth and carried an inscription identifying it 
as the first home run in Yankee Stadium, Scala took it to the Hall 
of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. There, he met Peter Clark, curator 
of collections for the baseball shrine. ``The only reason we went 
there was to get their opinion, not to authenticate it,'' Scala said. 
The first question he asked was whether Cooperstown had Ruth's first 
Yankee Stadium home run ball. Clark confirmed that it was not in the 
museum. He also told Scala that Ruth's signature on his ball was consistent 
with the Babe's autograph. That was good enough for Scala. He took 
the ball to authenticators, who examined its red and blue stitching, 
consistent with the technique used in 1923, and the inscription. They 
confirmed that Scala did, indeed, have the first Yankee Stadium homer, 
Ruth's exclamation point on the ballpark's opening day. When stories 
about the Ruth ball began circulating, Scala's grandmother got a phone 
call. ``It was from a man in his 90s, who said he knew my grandfather,'' 
Scala said. ``He called just to say what a nice man my grandfather 
was. It was wonderful for my grandmother to get a call like that.''
