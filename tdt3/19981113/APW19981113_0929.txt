Britain is withdrawing another 400 troops from Northern Ireland because 
of the reduced threat from paramilitary groups, Chief Constable Ronnie 
Flanagan said Friday. The troops from the Royal Artillery had been 
based in County Armagh. The withdrawal leaves 15,000 soldiers in Northern 
Ireland, the lowest level since 1970 and down by 2,000 from this summer, 
the army said. Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews said the troop 
removal and the dismantling of borderside vehicle checkpoints were 
``important steps on the way to the normalization of security arrangements,'' 
following the Northern Ireland peace accord.
