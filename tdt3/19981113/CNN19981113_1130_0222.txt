president clinton is scheduled to sign a bill at this hour that will 
increase the penalties for using a gun in federal crimes. the measure 
comes at the same time as a study which finds 43% of american homes 
with children have guns. 23% of those guns are loaded. despite the 
prevalence of guns at home, nearly three quarters of gun-owning parents 
don't think their children would handle a gun without their permission. 
the center to prevent handgun violence sponsored the study.
