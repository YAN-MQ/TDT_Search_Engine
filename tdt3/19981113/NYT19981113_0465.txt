A new law intended to reduce injuries and deaths from accidental shootings 
takes effect Saturday, requiring that all handguns sold in New York 
City have a safety locking device. But even as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
publicized the law Friday, he criticized it as inadequate and demanded 
that the City Council adopt additional restrictions that he has proposed. 
To promote the new rules, called Christopher's Law, the mayor held 
a news conference at City Hall with Cathline and Pedro Murphy, married 
city police officers whose 11-year-old son, Christopher, was killed 
last December in an accidental shooting involving a neighbor's gun. 
They were joined by leaders of three advocacy groups, Parents of Murdered 
Children, New Yorkers Against Gun Violence and Silent March. The leaders 
of the groups endorsed the new law and the mayor's proposed additions. 
``Every year, many lives are lost as a result of gun-related violence 
and accidental shootings,'' the mayor said. ``Negligence in the use 
and storage of weapons can be avoided, and precautions must be taken 
to prevent these tragedies from occurring.'' Although the mayor signed 
the legislation into law, he lost little time in criticizing it. ``It 
doesn't go far enough it,'' he said. ``It has more loopholes than 
answers.'' Specifically, he said, the City Council should enact his 
bill to require that gun owners not only buy locks but also use them; 
that locks be required not only for newly purchased guns but also 
for the estimated 250,000 guns already owned in the city, and that 
the rules be extended to rifles, shotguns, machine guns and assault 
weapons. Sheldon Leffler, chairman of the Council's Public Safety 
Committee, said that much of the mayor's proposal was impossible for 
the Council to pass because of superseding state jurisdiction. As 
for requiring locks at all times, Leffler said that witnesses at Council 
hearings had testified that they wanted the security of having their 
guns unlocked and ready when necessary. ``They said, `If someone is 
coming through the window at night, I want to be able to use the gun 
without having to take off the lock,''' Leffler said. Since most guns 
in the city are illegal, Leffler said, he doubted that owners of such 
guns would obey a retroactive law requiring them to add locks, as 
the mayor proposed. The locks cost $25 to $125, city officials said, 
and Leffler estimated that the law would affect thousands of guns 
sold each year. He said other localities around the nation had similar 
laws. The mayor said his administration had made its proposal six 
months ago and that he was ``perplexed'' that the Council had not 
acted by now. But Leffler said the proposals ``were not raised in 
the hearings or the negotiations'' between the Council and administration, 
``nor has the mayor asked me or anyone else in the Council, to my 
knowledge, since then.'' A violation of the law is punishable by a 
fine of up to $500 and 30 days in jail.
