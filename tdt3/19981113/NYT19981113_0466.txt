A 15-year-old autistic boy who was found wandering in the Erie Lackawanna 
Terminal in Hoboken, N.J., on Tuesday but could not identify himself 
was reunited with his mother Friday after she saw a news report about 
him on television. He had been missing from his Staten Island home 
for 11 days. The boy, Leshawn Ware, was returned to his mother, Stephanie 
Ware, at St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken, where he had been cared for 
since being found in the waterfront terminal's main waiting room. 
His mother had called New Jersey authorities after seeing his picture 
Thursday night on WWOR-TV. Although developmentally disabled, the 
boy was said by doctors to be unharmed and in good condition, was 
clean and did not even seem hungry. Officials said it was unclear 
where he had been or what he had done since he wandered away from 
his home in the Great Kills section on Nov. 2. But his mother told 
officials he had an affinity for mass transit. ``She said that he 
has a love for the trains and the buses, and she surmised that he 
must have gotten on a train or a bus or the ferry and had been traveling 
the system before he wound up in Hoboken,'' said Penny Bassett-Hackett, 
a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit. Mrs. Ware, who has four other 
children, none of whom are autistic, said that Leshawn, who attends 
special classes at an annex of Public School 25 in Staten Island, 
was wearing a black and white down jacket when he disappeared. She 
had called the New York City police to report him missing. When found 
by Erie Lackawanna station employees, he had no money and could not 
identify himself. But he was carrying five MetroCards from the New 
York City transit system, and gave his address as 370 Jay St. in Brooklyn, 
which turned out to be the headquarters of the New York City Transit 
Authority. The terminal where the boy was found is a hub for New Jersey 
Transit trains and buses, the Port Authority Trans-Hudson system and 
the New York Waterway Ferry from the World Financial Center in Manhattan. 
He might have come from almost anywhere. Law enforcement agencies, 
including New York police, were alerted, but no connection was made 
immediately. The boy seemed unruffled by his experiences in any case. 
``When we got him, he was clean and not particularly hungry,'' said 
Joan Quigley, a hospital spokeswoman. ``We suspect he was using the 
rest rooms in the train stations to freshen up.'' She also said that 
workers at a Burger King may have fed him, but she said she had no 
details.
