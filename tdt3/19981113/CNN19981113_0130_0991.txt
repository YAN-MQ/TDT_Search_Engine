Monsanto, the maker of drugs and farm products, plans to cut as many 
as 2,500 jobs. It's part of a plan to raise $5 billion for product 
development and acquisitions. The company says the restructuring became 
necessary after its proposed merger with American home products fell 
through last month. Texaco is cutting 1,000 jobs. It expects to save 
$200 million a year. It's the latest oil company to react to lower 
crude prices by slashing costs.
