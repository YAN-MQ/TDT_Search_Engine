The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 14: The 
$41.5 billion international package to support Brazil announced Friday 
has several things going for it. It is larger than had been expected, 
which makes it less likely that speculators will bet against Brazil 
and therefore makes it less likely that the money in the package will 
actually have to be used. It includes commitments not only from the 
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, but also from the United 
States and other major countries. Finally, it is based on promises 
by the Brazilian government that long-needed fiscal reforms will be 
put in place. Nonetheless, the package is risky. Brazil's currency, 
the real, remains overvalued, and nothing is being done directly to 
address that problem. The hope is that the country's existing program 
of gradual devaluation will eventually cure the problem. But in the 
meantime, that overvaluation could discourage international investment 
in the country. Only with such investment will it be possible for 
Brazil to lower the very high interest rates it has imposed to protect 
the real. Those high rates are very damaging to the economy. A lot 
remains to be done on fiscal problems by both the country's Congress 
and its state governments, and it is far from certain that the needed 
reforms will be approved. If they are not, the IMF and the other lenders 
will face difficult decisions regarding continued lending. Fortunately, 
world financial markets are far less nervous than they were even a 
month ago. As the largest economy in Latin America, Brazil's fate 
is of great importance to the region, and the economic health of the 
region could make the difference in determining whether the Asian 
recession spreads to this country.
