MTV Europe, once again, added some spice to their awards show this 
year, bestowing top honors to the Spice Girls, for the second time 
in two years. Sporty Spice and Baby Spice accepted the awards, Thursday, 
in Milan for the Best Group and the Best Pop Act. Madonna was the 
only other artist honored with two awards, for Best Female Singer, 
and Best New Album. That release is called, "Ray of Light". MTV Europe 
dubbed Robbie Williams the best male singer, while the Beastie Boys 
took home an award for the best Rap Group. Aerosmith took top honors 
for Rock, the group Prodigy for dance, and Natalie Imbroglia won an 
award for hit song, "Torn".
