In a sign that the turmoil at Citigroup Inc. may be far from over, 
the financial giant's investment banking unit, Salomon Smith Barney, 
told employees Friday that they will have to wait a month longer than 
usual to collect their annual bonus checks. The company will pay bonuses 
on Jan. 28, 1999, a month later than scheduled. Bonuses usually make 
up the bulk of an investment banker's annual compensation and are 
the subject of intense competition and scrutiny. The decision was 
detailed in an internal memorandum that stated that the company needed 
``adequate time to effectively manage the compensation process.'' 
The memo said that Michael Carpenter and Victor Menezes, the two executives 
in charge of managing the combined entity's corporate banking group, 
needed additional time to figure out bonuses. Earlier this month, 
Sanford Weill and John Reed, the co-chairmen of Citigroup, promoted 
Carpenter and Menezes to their new roles after dismissing James Dimon, 
the Citigroup president and heir apparent. The delay immediately raised 
concerns among bankers at Salomon, many of whom are already shaken 
by the rapid-fire changes at Citigroup. The concerns include worries 
that the new Citigroup will pay smaller bonuses than Salomon employees 
expect. Combining commercial and investment banking operations frequently 
brings about compensation conflicts, because many Wall Street investment 
banks pay their employees more than traditional banks do. Employees 
said they were also concerned that Carpenter and Menezes will disregard 
the compensation process that was already in full motion when Dimon 
and his chief lieutenant, Steven Black, left the company. ``There's 
a sense that the new guys want to do this their way _ and no one thinks 
that is good news for us,'' said one Salomon Smith Barney banker, 
who insisted on anonymity. Many on Wall Street expect that any Salomon 
bankers who are unhappy about their prospects at Citigroup since the 
departure of the popular Dimon will leave the firm, but not until 
after they collect their bonuses. The delay in paying bonuses gives 
a bit more time for the dust to settle before anyone defects. It also 
allows the new leadership to reallocate the bonus pool in favor of 
people they consider vital _ and to the disadvantage of those they 
do not value as highly. Other employees said they did not find anything 
especially disturbing about the announcement. One said that turbulent 
financial markets combined with the management shake-up made this 
an especially tricky year for deciding pay levels. ``I give them the 
benefit of the doubt; they just need another month to get this done,'' 
one said. A Citigroup spokesman said the company did not comment on 
compensation issues.
