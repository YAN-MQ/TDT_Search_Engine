Despite Iraqi prodding, Secretary-General Kofi Annan says he has no 
plans to mediate the latest crisis over U.N. arms inspections. The 
five permanent members of the Security Council _ the United States, 
Britain, France, Russia and China _ met Friday morning to discuss 
the crisis before the full 15-member council met with Annan later 
in the day. Diplomats who attended the closed meeting said there was 
a brief discussion about the secretary-general possibly flying to 
Baghdad _ but no proposal or initiative for him to do it. It's not 
that Iraq's traditional sympathizers on the council _ Russia, France 
and China _ don't want the secretary-general to go to Iraq. But they 
support the council's view that the next move is up to Iraq: It must 
resume full cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, and this is 
non-negotiable. Until Iraq complies, the council doesn't see any mission 
that Annan could undertake, the diplomats said. And so far, they said, 
there has been no movement from Baghdad. Annan was planning to meet 
the ambassadors of France, Russia and China before the Security Council 
meeting Friday, a French diplomat said. The crisis follows Baghdad's 
Oct. 31 decision to cut all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. 
Since then, the United States has sent more warships to the Gulf and 
speculation about American airstrikes has deepened.
