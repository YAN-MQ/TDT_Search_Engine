In light of the current tension in Iraq and the possibility of terrorist 
retaliation, the state department has issued a rare worldwide travel 
warning. Not a ban, but a warning. Americans who plan to travel abroad 
are being urged to first check state department updates on security 
conditions. Americans who are overseas are told to vary their routes 
and travel times, be careful with mail from unfamiliar sources and 
maintain low profiles.
