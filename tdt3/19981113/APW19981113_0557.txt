The International Monetary Fund neared completion of a long-expected 
dlrs 42 billion rescue package for Brazil as financiers sought to 
stop the economic upheaval in Russia and Asia from spreading to Latin 
America. ``This is not a done deal but we are close,'' an IMF official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said early Friday. The official 
could not confirm the exact amount of the bailout because negotiations 
were continuing. But he said dlrs 42 billion was close to the total 
amount of the three-year package needed by Latin America's largest 
economy. An announcement could come as early as Friday, possibly in 
both Washington and Brasilia, Brazil's capital. The IMF was expected 
to contribute between dlrs 15 billion and dlrs 18 billion to support 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's austerity plan of 
tax increases and spending cuts aimed at saving dlrs 23.5 billion 
so he can avert a devaluation of the country's currency, the real.
