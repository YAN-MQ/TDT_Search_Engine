Uncle Sam wants American children to help design a new poster to sell 
U.S. savings bonds. The treasury department will award almost $100,000 
in bonds to more than 150 children who submit winning entries. The 
grand prize winner will get a $5,000 bond, and their design will be 
used in the 2000 ad campaign. For more information, point your Internet 
browsers to www.savingsbonds.gov.
