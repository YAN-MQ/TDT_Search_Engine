The Marine Corps decided Friday not to punish an officer who wrote 
a newspaper column rebuking President Clinton as an ``adulterous liar,'' 
in a case that focused attention on the military's prohibitions on 
public criticisms of the commander in chief. The officer, Shane Sellers, 
a 41-year-old intelligence analyst, received the military equivalent 
of a stern talking-to from his commanding officer but otherwise was 
not punished for the column, which appeared on Oct. 12 in The Navy 
Times, an independent weekly newspaper. Sellers' column was one voice 
in a small but vocal chorus of officers and enlisted personnel grousing 
about Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Although hardly a groundswell, 
the comments raised enough concern within the Pentagon that the Marine 
Corps and the Air Force each took the unusual step of reminding officers 
that Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice explicitly 
prohibits them from speaking ``contemptuous words'' about the president 
or other civilian leaders of the military. Sellers, who is assigned 
to work at the Defense Intelligence Agency, lamented in his column 
that Clinton was not being held to the same standards as uniformed 
officers, who could face punishment and even court-martial for having 
an adulterous relationship with someone who worked for them. ``It's 
not about sex,'' Sellers wrote. ``It's tawdry and titillating, to 
be sure. But for all its soap-opera quality, what Clinton and Monica 
did as consenting adults boils down to adultery. And one should call 
an adulterous liar exactly what he is _ a criminal.'' The Marine Corps 
declined to discuss the findings of an investigation into the matter 
except to announce that Brig. Gen. Frances Wilson, commander of the 
Marine Corps base at Quantico, Va., met Friday with Sellers and now 
considers the case closed, with no formal punitive action having been 
taken. Under Article 88, Sellers could have received a letter of reprimand 
or other administrative punishments that could have harmed his career. 
``It is a private issue between a superior and a subordinate,'' Capt. 
Sean Clements, a spokesman at Quantico, said of what was discussed 
at the meeting. ``She considers the issue closed.'' Sellers, in a 
telephone interview, said he considered the outcome ``in all honesty 
appropriate.'' Although he wrote bluntly about Clinton's affair, he 
said he did not intend the remarks to be ``contemptuous'' and believed 
that Article 88 set necessary guidelines for officers to respect civilian 
control of the military. Sellers said he would continue to write regularly 
for The Navy Times, though probably on other topics. ``I have no intention 
of writing any more about the president,'' he said. ``He gets enough 
attention.'' Although prosecutions under Article 88 are rare, new 
cases keep arising. The Marine Corps has opened another inquiry into 
a Marine Corps reservist, Maj. Daniel Rabil, who wrote an article 
in The Washington Times on Monday. In it, he called Clinton ``integrity 
impaired'' and ``perhaps the most selfish man ever to disgrace our 
presidency.''
