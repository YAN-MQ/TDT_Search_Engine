Despite Iraqi prodding, Secretary-General Kofi Annan has no plans 
to mediate the latest crisis with Iraq and is still waiting for Baghdad 
to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, his spokesman 
reiterated Friday. Annan met the 15-member Security Council on Friday 
to discuss the standoff after a private session with the ambassadors 
of Russia, China and France _ who have been sympathetic to Baghdad's 
call for lifting crippling economic sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. The three ambassadors did 
not respond to shouted questions about the meeting as they walked 
into the Security Council chamber, followed minutes later by Annan. 
Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov indicated that there were no new 
initiatives to get Baghdad to rescind its ban on weapons inspections. 
``We are discussing the diplomatic efforts to end the crisis,'' Chinese 
Ambassador Qin Huasun said. As the U.S. military buildup continued 
amid speculation about possible American airstrikes, the secretary-general's 
office and the U.N. Security Council made clear again Friday that 
``the ball is in Iraq's court'' and the resumption of unfettered weapons 
inspections is non-negotiable. The secretary-general spoke to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton for 10 minutes Friday morning about Iraq's 
confrontation with the council, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
