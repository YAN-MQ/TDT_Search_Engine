Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is tonight offering his first olive branch 
in the latest standoff over UN weapons inspections. He says he wants 
a diplomatic solution, but not at any price. With the latest, here's 
Richard Downs in Baghdad. President Saddam Hussein says he is ready 
to respond to any initiative to end this crisis, but only one that 
meets the demands of the Iraqi people. They include an end to the 
economic embargo on Iraq and the sacking of the UN weapons inspection 
chairman, Richard Butler. The statement says that the Iraqi president 
has received two letters -- one from Russian president Boris Yeltsin, 
the other from Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister. The contents 
of the letters has not been released, but it is presumed that they 
must relate to some sort of an initiative to end the standoff. Richard 
Downs, BBC News, Baghdad.
