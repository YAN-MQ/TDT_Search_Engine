Dutch police have arrested three men suspected of owning and distributing 
child pornography and seized thousands of electronically stored images, 
prosecutors announced Friday. The identities of the arrested men, 
aged 23, 25 and 50 years, were not released, nor were details of the 
3,000 pornographic images found during police searches Thursday. Police 
seized computers, videotapes and CD-ROMs from the suspects' homes 
in Uden in the eastern Netherlands and in Voorburg, a small town on 
the outskirts of The Hague. There was no immediate indication that 
the men were linked to a Dutch-based international pedophilia ring 
that was smashed this summer after the discovery of a huge stash of 
child pornography in an apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort. 
The Zandvoort case involved a ring that used the Internet to spread 
images of children as young as 18 months being raped. In a press release, 
the Hague Public Prosecutor's Office added that police had been given 
permission to use an undercover informant in their latest investigations 
_ the first time an infiltrator has been deployed in a Dutch child 
porn case. The decision was taken ``in view of the seriousness of 
the allegations and in order to get a good overview of the ... suspects,'' 
according to the prosecutor's office statement.
