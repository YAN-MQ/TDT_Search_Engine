Book agent lucianne Goldberg says she is to blame for Linda Tripp's 
legal troubles. Thursday, Goldberg testified before a Maryland grand 
jury investigating whether Tripp broke the law by taping her phone 
conversations with Monica lewinsky. Goldberg also handed over two 
tapes of conversations she had with Tripp and two tapes of Tripp's 
conversations with Lewinsky. After she testified, Goldberg defended 
Tripp's integrity. Look what's happened to Kathleen Willey, look what's 
happened to Paula jones, look what's happened to Jane Doe 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, 6, 7. they have been totally co-opted, slam-dunked, and their 
reputations destroyed. And Linda, the only thing that keeps her hanging 
on by her thumbs is the fact that she had these tapes. And I don't 
care what you say about her, she has not told a lie in this, I have 
not told a lie in this, everything we have said for one solid year 
has proven to be true. The maximum penalty for breaking Maryland's 
wiretap law is five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
