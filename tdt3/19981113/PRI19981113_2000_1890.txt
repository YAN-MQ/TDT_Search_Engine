There have been fierce clashes in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, 
between security forces and thousands of protesters demanding political 
reform. At least six students were reported killed after soldiers 
fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowds -- a response this 
protester says was excessive. There just -- maybe they just throw 
tear gas. They're not shooting at us. Not shooting at my friend here. 
You can see. Analysts say it's the worst violence since President 
Suharto was overthrown in May, and there's a danger the confrontation 
could spread into wider unrest.
