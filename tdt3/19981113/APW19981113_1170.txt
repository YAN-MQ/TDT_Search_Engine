A tractor driver uncovered a 100-kilogram (220-pound) World War II-era 
bomb Friday outside an apartment building in central Siberia, a news 
report said. The area was cordoned off, and explosives experts were 
to study the bomb Saturday, Alexei Buravtsov, head of the Novosibirsk 
emergency department, was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency as saying. 
The tractor driver was moving piles of sand in a construction zone 
when he uncovered the bomb late Friday, the report said. It gave no 
other details. It was the second World War II-era bomb found in Novosibirsk, 
about 2800 kilometers (1,750 miles) east of Moscow, in recent weeks. 
The other was safely destroyed at a military air base. There are several 
bases in and around Novosibirsk that were used by the Soviet military.
