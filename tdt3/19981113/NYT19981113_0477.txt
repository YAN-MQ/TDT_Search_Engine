Kyra Nijinsky, a dancer who was the daughter of Vaslav Nijinsky, one 
of this century's greatest ballet dancers and choreographers, died 
on Sept. 1 at the Pine Ridge Care Center in San Rafael, Calif. She 
led a reclusive life in San Francisco and details of her death become 
nationally known only recently. She was 84. Miss Nijinsky identified 
artistically with her celebrated father, whose career was curtailed 
by mental illness. With her high cheekbones and muscular physique, 
she even resembled him. During the 1930s she sometimes attended ballet 
classes dressed like the male students in white shirt and tights rather 
than in the tunics women then favored. Born in Vienna, she spent her 
childhood on tour with her parents and at a school in Switzerland. 
She received early dance training from her aunt, the choreographer 
Bronislava Nijinska, and at the Paris Opera Ballet School. Never long 
associated with any company, Miss Nijinsky attracted special attention 
in London in the 1930s. She impersonated her father in ``Le Spectre 
de la Rose,'' one of his greatest roles, in ``Streamline'' a sophisticated 
revue of 1934. She then went into the Ballet Rambert, where her parts 
included that of a nymph in a revival of her father's ``Apres-Midi 
d'un Faune.'' In 1934 she also created her most important role for 
the Rambert troupe in Antony Tudor's astrological fantasy, ``The Planets.'' 
As the Mortal Born Under Neptune, she portrayed a mystical longing 
to unite with the infinite. Although admitting that Miss Nijinsky 
was not a strong technician, the British critic Arnold Haskell called 
her ``a dancer who understands, whether instinctively or otherwise, 
how to use dancing to express her emotions.'' Miss Nijinsky's stage 
career began fading after she married the conductor Igor Markevitch 
in 1936; the marriage ended in divorce, and Markevitch, who died in 
1983, raised their son, Vaslav Nijinsky Markevitch. While living in 
Italy during World War II, Miss Nijinsky was briefly imprisoned by 
the Nazis, who accused her of spying. After the war, she worked as 
an interpreter and managed a boutique. Moving to San Francisco in 
1954, she became a painter and poet. Deeply religious, she devoted 
herself to the expression of spiritual themes. She is survived by 
her son; a sister, Tamara Nijinsky of Phoenix, and four grandchildren.
