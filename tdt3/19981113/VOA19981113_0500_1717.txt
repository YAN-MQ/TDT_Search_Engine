There are a lot of science fiction fans may be heading to American 
theaters, starting November 20th. But not to see the movie, you see 
November 20th is the date on which US theaters will start showing 
the short preview of scenes from the new Star Wars science fiction 
adventure. And of course fans will want to be there, even if it is 
just for a peak at parts of the film. The trailer will present two 
minutes of scenes from the first Star Wars film since 1983. This one 
is titled, "Episode One: The Phantom Menace". The new movie is being 
called a prequel instead of a sequel. That's because its story takes 
place before the stories in the existing Star Wars movies. The trailer 
for "Episode One: The Phantom Menace," is being shown six-months before 
the film itself is due to open in the United States. That will be 
on May 21st, 1999. That's probably because they were not finished 
filming the whole movie yet.
