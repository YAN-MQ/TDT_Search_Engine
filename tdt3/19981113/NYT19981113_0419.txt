The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 14: Chicago 
has now joined New Orleans in a promising new legal offensive against 
gun violence. On Thursday, Chicago's mayor, Richard Daley, filed a 
$433 million lawsuit against 22 gun manufacturers, four gun distributors, 
and 12 suburban stores. The suit charged them them with creating a 
``public nuisance'' by knowingly flooding the city, which has some 
of the nation's strictest gun control laws, with illegal weapons. 
Chicago's lawsuit follows by just two weeks a related legal action 
against the gun industry filed by New Orleans, based on different 
legal grounds. The purpose of both suits, as well as stepped-up litigation 
by individuals against gun makers, is to force a recalcitrant industry 
to make its deadly product less accessible to criminals and children. 
Spokesmen for the gun industry deny responsibility for gun violence 
and deride the suits as a far-fetched attempt to duplicate the success 
of the anti-tobacco litigation. They also threaten to use their political 
muscle if, as expected, Philadelphia and other big cities follow up 
with their own lawsuits _ overlooking the strong support for gun control 
among voters. But as a legal matter, the weapons makers have good 
reason to be worried. No one can say how the courts will respond to 
the central premise of the Chicago case _ that gun manufacturers intentionally 
saturate gun stores just outside city limits with more guns than the 
lawful market could possible absorb, in order to supply a large and 
profitable illegal market. But judges and juries are aware that gun 
violence imposes heavy costs on urban America. They are also likely 
to be impressed by evidence produced by undercover operatives that 
criminals can easily buy guns at suburban stores for criminal acts 
inside the Chicago city limits. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School 
professor who helped prepare some of the successful litigation against 
the tobacco industry, suggests that the manufacturers' argument that 
they are several steps removed from the actual sale of guns may not 
be enough to escape liability. The suit filed by the mayor of New 
Orleans, Marc Morial, takes a different legal approach, using the 
traditional claim of product liability to try to hold the gun industry 
accountable. By failing to incorporate feasible safety devices, Morial 
argues, firearms manufacturers have made their product ``unreasonably 
dangerous.'' The idea that a manufacturer's responsibility extends 
beyond the gun's owner and intended users to unintended users, like 
children, gives the case a certain novelty. But the principle that 
a manufacturer can be held liable for damage caused by a product that 
is ``unreasonably dangerous'' is solidly imbedded in Louisiana law. 
The technology exists to make guns safer and to ``personalize'' a 
weapon so that only its owner can fire it _ by, for instance, installing 
a simple combination lock. It should not be necessary to sue the industry 
to force it to meet its obligations. But so far nothing else has worked.
