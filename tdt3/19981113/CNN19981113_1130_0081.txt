pentagon officials tell cnn they're ready to attack iraq if president 
clinton gives the order. but it may be as long as a week before the 
u.s. military's assets are in place in the persian gulf region. david 
goodnow reports on the deployment. from travis air force base in california 
-- to ft. stewart, georgia -- and at more than a dozen bases in between 
-- u.s. forces are getting ready and moving out. some 100 personnel 
from tinker air force base in oklahoma are preparing to ship out over 
the next few days. their job will be to provide surveillance and communications 
for other forces in the gulf. life in the desert won't be easy. they're 
still living in tents still eating dust. and so it's not the most 
pleasant place to be and of course, again, they're away from their 
families. they don't always get much warning. here at langley air 
force base in virginia, some members of this advance team had only 
a few hours to pack up and go. it's a little bit of nervousness, we're 
leaving behind loved ones and friends. hopefully not going too far 
into harm's way, but it's the job we signed up for, and we're ready 
to go. of course you're a little bit hesitant at first. but everybody 
wants to go over there, get it done. and come on back home. when do 
they come back home? the question is on nearly everyone's mind. i've 
been telling my crews, plan on cooking turkey wherever you're going 
to go, but hopefully, you'll be home for christmas. but we're ready 
to stay as long as it takes. so in arizona, the c-130s at davis-monthan 
are undergoing their final checks. the soldiers at fort stewart are 
loading up. the kc-10s at travis are ready for their refueling missions. 
all the pieces are coming together. we gotta do what we gotta do.
