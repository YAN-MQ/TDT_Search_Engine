Some 2,000 mourners turned out Friday to bid farewell to Jean Marais, 
one of France's most beloved actors, buried in the simple cemetery 
of his Riviera village. Even in death, the smooth baritone voice of 
Marais, who died Sunday at age 84, resounded through St. Anne church, 
in Valluris, southern France, where village friends and actors paid 
tribute: ``Give up! Let go! Life is dead! Long live life!'' Spoken
