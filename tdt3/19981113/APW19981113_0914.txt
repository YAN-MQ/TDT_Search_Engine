In his first public statement since the start of the dispute over 
U.N. weapons inspections, President Saddam Hussein said Friday he 
was not trying to create a crisis or stop cooperation with the United 
Nations. The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Saddam as saying his 
decisions Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 to restrict the activities of U.N. weapons 
inspectors ``were intended to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.'' 
He didn't elaborate, but apparently was talking about Iraq's often-stated 
demand that punishing U.N. trade sanctions imposed eight years ago 
be lifted.
