India, which has up to 5 million carriers of the virus that causes 
AIDS has agreed to develop an AIDS vaccine and join international 
efforts for a cure. The head of India's national AIDS organization 
discussed the matter with New Delhi Correspondent Douglas Backshin. 
India's national AIDS control organization, MACO made the decision 
this month after talks with officials of the US National Institutes 
of Health, and the United Nation's AIDS Program. India's cabinet must 
still ratify the move, and MACO says a working group will be formed 
to finalize details of the program. Once a vaccine is developed, the 
way will be clear for testing. Medical experts describe the decision 
as a major step in the fight against AIDS. India refused international 
clinical trials nine years ago, following domestic criticism that 
Indians could be used as test subjects by western countries and drug 
firms. The head of MACO Prasade Roul told VOA these concerns are being 
addressed. We in India, we always feel that we should not put our 
population to vaccine trials of something that is developed abroad. 
Whatever is developed has to be developed indigenously, or with collaboration 
with Indian research laboratories. Then only can it brought to test 
in Indian conditions. Analysts say India, a conservative country, 
has had problems addressing many issues linked to AIDS, including 
prostitution and teenage sex. Mr. Roul says sex remains a sensitive 
matter and must be handled properly. About sex, I consider it a topic, 
which is not discussed with Indians openly. But I think, because of 
this problem of AIDA and because of the problem of relations, I think 
there is a case to talk more about sex and sexuality. But not in a 
direct way, which you know you have to take the sensitivities of a 
population into consideration, and deal with it more like a family 
life education. But if you approach it from the "pure sex" point of 
view, then there could be a little backlash. Mr. Roul estimates there 
are between 3 and 5 million Indians infected with the HIV virus that 
leads to AIDS. But he says if India mobilizes its resources now, it 
can tackle the problem. Douglas Backshin, VOA News, New Delhi.
