A Russian ship rescued six North Koreans whose tugboat was ripped 
from a barge during a storm in the Sea of Japan, a news report said 
Friday. The three men, one woman and two children were brought to 
the Russian port of Nakhodka and were working with Korean authorities 
to return to North Korea, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The 
barge was going from one North Korean port to another when it hit 
a storm and the tugboat broke loose. The Russian ship Ivan Vernigorenko 
was on its way to Nakhodka when it spotted the drifting boat and rescued 
the Koreans, city officials said. Nakhodka is about 250 kilometers 
(150 miles) northeast of the North Korean border. The report did not 
say when the rescue took place.
