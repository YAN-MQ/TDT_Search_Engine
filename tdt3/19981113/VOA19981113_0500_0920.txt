Global climate change is one urgent environmental problem. Species 
extinction is another, and a story on that theme emerges from Africa, 
today. The Kenya Wildlife Service says it is worried about an illness 
that is killing the country's rare Hirolda antelope, already near 
extinction. From Nairobi, Sonia Lawrence Green reports, that a special 
veterinary team has been sent to investigate the deaths. Kenya Wildlife 
Service Director, Richard Leekey said the rare Hirolda Antelope appears 
to have been struck by a deadly disease. He said 12 Hirolda were found 
dead in the northeastern Arawalie Game Reserve, indicating that many 
more might be infected or dying. I have sent veterinary teams to the 
areas today, with instructions to collect some of the carcasses, to 
carry out an aerial organization as to the numbers that might be - 
obviously. It's not easy to do from the air - and to bring back some 
material that can enable us to establish what it is that is killing 
these things. Local leader say they think the Hirolda antelopes were 
infected with a tick-born illness. Mr. Leekey says, that is very likely. 
Tick-born yes, but is it is it a new disease, is it anthrax, and is 
it something that has spread from a domestic beast? I simply don't 
know. It's clearly a matter of breakthrough time, given the rarity 
of the species. And all I can tell you is we will give it a priority. 
The Hirolda is a species of antelope found exclusively on a strip 
of land between Kenya's northern Tana River, and the Somali border. 
Also known as the "hunter's antelope" or "harte beast", the Hirolda 
are grazing animals hardy enough to survive in arid and semi-arid 
conditions. But they are now facing extinction. In the 1970's there 
were 20,000 Hirolda's. Now there are only about 350 left, a decline 
experts blame on poaching, draught, and pressures from people and 
livestock in their territory. In an attempt to save the Hiroldas, 
the Kenya Wildlife Services relocated 33 of the animals to the Tsavo 
National Park in 1996. But the operation stopped after local officials 
sued the KWS for taking away a potential tourist attraction and source 
of income. Sonia Lawrence-Green for VOA News, Nairobi.
