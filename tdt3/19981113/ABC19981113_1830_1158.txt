It has been a very long time but the department of agriculture is 
still trying to solve a lingering effect of slavery. Millions of former 
slaves began their free lives working their own land. But even today, 
black farmers claim, the agriculture department discriminates against 
them. Hundreds of black farmers have filed a $3 billion lawsuit. Against 
the government. Here's ABC's Steve Osunsami. For 60 years, David odom 
grew cotton on his own land. But today, his 350 acres belongs to someone 
else. Now he cuts grass to pay his bills and he blames the U.S. department 
of agriculture which delayed and denied his loans for years. I just 
think they're just out to get the black farmer, and they don't care 
how. Odom and hundreds of other black farmers accuse the usda of discrimination 
and point to their local usda offices, where administrators control 
billions of dollars in loans. The usda's own internal investigation 
showed black farmers waited three times longer than white farmers 
for loans and subsidies. They don't think that a black farmer is as 
good as a white farmer. So when he does get a loan, he gets less money 
and he gets I later and with more ntrol. What do we want? Justice. 
What do we want? Justice. At the usda, where farmers continue to protest, 
even the man in charge admits there's a problem. I do think that there 
were clearly instances where black farmers were not treated in the 
same fashion that white farmers were. These delays and controls force 
black farmers to plant their crops late in the season, or borrow from 
lenders with higher interest rates. Either way, black farmers lose 
money and move further into debt. And in many cases, lose their farms. 
70-year-old dozella Bullock worries her farm is next. She says her 
husband withstood the delays and foreclosure notices for years, and 
then died from the stress of it all. The usda says she still owes 
them $400,000. I feel terrible, they've taken everything from me. 
It's the pain oforking for nhing, and still losing everything that 
has robbed many black farmers of their faith in the department of 
agriculture. To them, the usda has become the last plantation. Steve 
Osunsami, ABC News, tillery, North Carolina.
