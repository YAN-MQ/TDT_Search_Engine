India's Vipor Chemicals Ltd., which supplies pharmaceuticals to international 
drug companies, plans to appeal an Indian ban on manufacturing quinacrine 
pellets used to sterilize women, Dow Jones Newswires reported Friday. 
Vipor, based in the western Indian city of Baroda, is believed to 
be the world's only producer of quinacrine, which also is used as 
a malaria treatment. Vipor sells 2.5 tons to 3 tons of quinacrine 
a year, accounting for 10 percent to 15 percent of the company's sales, 
Chairman P.S. Patel was quoted as telling Dow Jones. In August, following 
complaints that quinacrine as a sterilization method was painful and 
possibly dangerous to a woman's health, the Indian government outlawed 
the import, manufacture, sale and distribution of contraceptive pellets 
of quinacrine designed to be inserted directly into the uterus. ``We 
plan to appeal to the Supreme Court,'' Patel was quoted as saying. 
``This is a one-sided judgment and needs to be studied again.'' The 
World Health Organization opposes quinacrine sterilization, which 
are irreversible, saying the drug may cause cancer. The U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration recently asked two North Carolina-based contraceptive 
researchers to halt all distribution of quinacrine pellets and to 
destroy their existing stocks. Though WHO and others have come out 
against quinacrine pellets, the method still has its advocates _ including 
doctors in India _ who say it makes sterilization easy and cheap. 
Advocates also question whether there's evidence of a cancer risk. 
Vipor has received queries from abroad _ including the United States 
_ asking about the possible supply of quinacrine pellets, Patel told 
Dow Jones Newswires. He believes quinacrine is a safe, affordable 
contraceptive for the developing world. Patel said he plans to compile 
medical data and then ask the Supreme Court to allow him to make the 
pellets for export. Seeking permission to sell quinacrine pellets 
in India would follow.
