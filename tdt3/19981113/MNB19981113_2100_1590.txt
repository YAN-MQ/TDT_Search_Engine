Time for the weather. Starting to feel like fall. We go to wbs NBC 
TV in New York. Janice huff Brian, in some parts of the country, starting 
to feel like country. Across the Canadian border, little snow storm 
there tonight. Nothing major, nothing too heavy. You can see light 
snow showers awe cross upstate New York. We are expecting heavy snow 
over parts of Idaho in Washington as a new storm system approaches 
the northwest coast. Could see up to three to six inches of snow there. 
The southeast is starting to dry out after all the heavy rain. It's 
63 in Atlanta, 7 in Orlando. Lows in the 60's tonight in most of Florida. 
It will be cold from the Great Lakes down through the plains and into 
the central Rockies with lows in the teens and 20's. Tomorrow, all 
the way down the line to the 80's across southern Florida and southern 
Texas. There it still feels like maybe late summer or early fall. 
Showers expected tomorrow in Seattle with a high of 49. Sunshine in 
L.A. and Phoenix, 80 there. 62 in Washington. Showers in Boston. As 
we go through time, the snow storm tomorrow moving through the Rockies, 
shifting into the Great Lakes my Thursday. Cold air pouring in. Meanwhile, 
most of the southern states remaining warm and sunny from arizona, 
New Mexico, down through Florida. Scatters showers and thunderstorms 
in Tennessee. That's the weather around the nation. Janice, thank 
you.
