In other news tonight -- it's official. There is a draft deal between 
eight states and the tobacco industry. As we reported earlier in the 
week, the states could get more than $200 billion for medical costs, 
and restrictions on tobacco marketing. If enough states agree to the 
terms next week, it will be the largest legal settlement in history.
