The International Labor Organization has chronicled details of thousands 
of workplace hazards, showing that high-tech hazards have added to 
traditional threats like accident and infectious disease for tens 
of millions of workers. The Encyclopedia of Occupational Health and 
Safety contains more than 4,000 pages about risks in the workplace 
and how to combat them. Many of the dangers laid out in the encyclopedia, 
the fourth edition published by the U.N. labor agency, are the same 
as in the first edition in 1930. For instance, a 1993 fire that killed 
188 workers at a toy factory in Thailand was similar to a 1911 New 
York clothing factory fire which previously held the record for the 
highest number of fatalities with 146 dead. Both factories had inadequate 
prevention, protection and escape systems. And both hadn't given workers 
enough fire safety training. ``I was struck by the sense of history 
repeating itself,'' Jeanne Mager Stellman, a Colombia University professor 
and editor of the encyclopedia, said in an interview Friday. ``We've 
learned much. But we've expanded the hazards and the old ones are 
still there.'' Respiratory diseases like asthma cause the most diseases 
and injuries worldwide, according to the encyclopedia. Infectious 
diseases ranging from hepatitis to tuberculosis are also high on the 
list. Pesticide poisoning is the cause of hundreds of thousands of 
deaths in the developing world where untrained workers use chemicals 
that have been banned in industrialized countries, according to Mager 
Stellman. But even rich countries still use pesticides that are known 
to pose a health risk, like a herbicide called 2,4,5-T used in rice 
fields in the United States, the ILO says. In industrialized countries 
repetitive strain injury resulting from intensive work with computers 
is becoming a major cause of disability,'' said Mager Stellman. She 
said in the United States in 1995, 31,457 workers received compensation 
for carpal tunnel syndrome _ a painful condition of the wrist. More 
than 70 percent were women. ``As we have more and more automated work 
places, the number of women with these kind of injuries is growing 
dramatically,'' said Mager Stellman. Other modern hazards range from 
nuclear plant accidents to chemical processes used to make semiconductors. 
Mager Stellman said the workplace has become much safer for the vast 
majority of people in developed countries thanks to education, training, 
legal protection, better nutrition and health care. But in developing 
countries, many workers have no options or education and face similar 
health hazards prevalent at the time of the ILO's first encyclopedia 
in 1930. The encyclopedia is aimed at management, unions, regulatory 
authorities and health professionals. It also comes in CD-ROM format.
