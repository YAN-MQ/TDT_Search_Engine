Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister, Tariq Azis said Thursday, that Washington 
is to blame for the current crisis. He said Iraq has not violated 
the Memorandum of Understanding that governs the weapons inspection 
process. Rather, he said, Chief Arms Inspector Richard Butler was 
guilty of breaching the agreement. The Iraqi Foreign Minister furthered 
argued that Washington had waged a war of sanctions against Iraq for 
seven years.
