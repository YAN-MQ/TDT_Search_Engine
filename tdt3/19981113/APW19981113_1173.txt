BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO ambassadors approved plans Friday for 
a French-commanded rapid reaction force that will stand ready to rescue 
unarmed civilian verifiers in Kosovo should they come under threat. 
The political approval of the military's operations plans means Gen. 
Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe, can begin calling 
up troops from nations who have volunteered to participate in the 
1,200-1,800-strong all-European force, which will be based in neighboring 
Macedonia. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
is in the process of putting 2,000 civilian verifiers into Kosovo. 
These observers will insure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
lives up to the agreement he made with American negotiator Richard 
Holbrooke Oct. 12. Hundreds of people have died and hundreds of thousands 
have been displaced in the conflict between ethnic Albanians, who 
make up 90 percent of Kosovo, and Serb police and military forces. 
Ethnic Albanians are seeking independence for the southern Serb province. 
The cease-fire declared in Kosovo last month is shaky at best, with 
a low level of violence continuing nearly every day. NATO ambassadors 
discussed the compliance issue again on Friday and once again expressed 
concern that the simmering violence could flare into a major conflict, 
officials said. The NATO ``extraction force,'' called Joint Guarantor, 
will be on standby in Macedonia and prepared to rescue any of the 
civilian verifiers that might find themselves under attack or in a 
threatening situation. The force will be in the normal NATO chain 
of command under the headquarters for Allied Forces in Southern Europe, 
in Naples, Italy, and under Clark's overall authority. France has 
not been a part of NATO's integrated military command since President 
Charles de Gaulle withdrew his forces from it in 1966. However, the 
French are expected to make up about half the force. Germany, Britain 
and the Netherlands also have volunteered troops, and NATO officials 
said the force also would be open to non-NATO members, including Russia. 
Officials said they expected the NATO ``activation order'' to come 
sometime next week, which would begin actually putting Joint Guarantor 
into place.
