Svetlana Beriosova, who danced across many stages in Britain, has 
died at age 66. Beriosova died Tuesday at St. Charles's Hospital in 
London, according to a death notice published Friday in The Daily 
Telegraph. She died of cancer, according to an obituary published 
Thursday in The Guardian. Born in 1932 to the late ballet master Nicholas 
Berizoff in Lithuania, Beriosova grew up around the stage, following 
her father as he moved to ballet companies throughout Europe and the 
United States, the newspaper said. Her own dancing career began in 
New York in 1941 when she appeared with Massine's Ballet Russe de 
Monte Carlo as Clara in ``The Nutcracker.'' Her professional debute 
as an adult came in 1947 in ``The Nutcracker'' and ``Les sylphides'' 
with Canada's Ottawa Ballet. She followed her father in joining the 
Cuevas Grand Ballet in Monte Carlo that same year, then went with 
him to England in 1948 to join the Metropolitan Ballet. When that 
company folded in 1949, Beriosova accepted an invitation from Ninette 
de Valois to join the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet, where she stayed 
until her retirement in 1975. She created the role of Princess Belle 
Rose in Cranko's ``The Prince of the Pagodas'' and the title role 
in ``Antigone,'' and George Balanchine created the leading role of 
``Trumpet Concerto'' for her. She was also the principal dancer in 
Kenneth MacMillan's ``Diversions'' where she undertook the spoken 
role, speaking in French as well the dancing. In 1959, she married 
the late Mohammed Masud Khan; their marriage was dissolved 15 years 
later. She had no children. A funeral service will be held at All 
Saints Russian Orthodox Cathedral on Nov. 19, followed by private 
cremation.
