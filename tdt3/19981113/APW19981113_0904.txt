Georgia renewed its demand Friday that Russia extradite a former Georgian 
security chief who is accused of organizing a 1995 assassination attempt 
against President Eduard Shevardnadze. In a letter delivered to the 
Russian embassy in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, the government demanded 
the return of Igor Georgadze to face charges of terrorism stemming 
from the Aug. 29, 1995, attack. Georgadze is believed to be in Russia, 
and Georgian Foreign Ministry spokesman Avtandil Napetvaridze noted 
that he had recently been interviewed on Russian television. ``Despite 
repeated requests to extradite him, Russian law enforcement bodies 
keep saying they do not know his whereabouts. However, Russian journalists 
are perfectly well informed of this,'' Napetvaridze told reporters. 
Earlier this year, Russia honored a Georgian request that it extradite 
a former Georgian finance minister wanted in another, more recent 
assassination attempt against Shevardnadze. Georgia said at the time 
that the gesture had helped warm relations between the two neighbors. 
Relations between Georgia and Russia have been strained at times during 
the seven years since the Soviet collapse.
