Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered Frenchman Guillaume 
Raoux 6-1, 6-1 in a lopsided quarterfinal of the dlrs 1.1 million 
Kremlin Cup tennis tournament Friday. Earlier, it took the hard-hitting 
Marc Rosset of Switzerland only 49 minutes to down qualifier Jan Kroslak 
of to reach Saturday's semifinal. Kafelnikov, seeded second, came 
out strong in the first set. He hit two aces to end the first game 
and broke immediately in the second. The Russian's ability to make 
points when he needed them, combined with Raoux's frequent unforced 
errors, made the first set pass in less than a half an hour. In the 
sixth and seventh games, Kafelnikov came back from 0-30 to beat Raoux, 
who only managed to hold the fourth game. In the second set, Kafelnikov 
controlled Raoux just as easily, keeping him pointless to break in 
the first, and served without dropping a point in the second. Raoux 
never even threatened, sending balls careening wide or into the net. 
He could only hold serve in the third game, and didn't have a single 
ace to Kafelnikov's eight overall. The match was the pair's fourth 
face-off, over which Kafelnikov, ranked eighth on the ATP tour, has 
not dropped a single game. Meanwhile, sixth-seeded Rosset, two-time 
Kremlin Cup champion, blitzed Kroslak 6-2, 6-4 with 14 aces in all. 
In quarterfinal doubles action Martin Damm and Cyril Suk defeated 
Andrei Medvedev and Vladimir Voltchkov 4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3.
