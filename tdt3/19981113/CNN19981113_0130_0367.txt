Federal agents in Los Angeles have uncovered an illegal immigration 
operation that stretches across several states. Jennifer Auther reports 
on what's being called the largest seizure of counterfeit documents 
in the history of the I.N.S. This raid on a 12 x 10-foot storage shed 
just outside downtown los Angeles is expected to put a choke hold 
on the counterfeit document business throughout the United States. 
Special agents from the U.S. immigration and naturalization service 
confiscated 2 million phony government documents. The Tuesday night 
raid uncovered drivers' licenses from California, colorado and several 
other states, social security cards, resident alien cards, permanent 
resident, or "green" cards, printing equipment and more. We found 
several major credit card companies that we're working with have documented 
losses in excess of $3 million where these identification documents 
were used to cash stolen and counterfeit travelers checks and credit 
cards. According to the I.N.S., 12 people have been arrested since 
august. More arrests are expected. This is an organized crime group, 
comprised of predominately Mexican nationals. The phony documents 
sell on the street for anywhere from $40 to $100. Illegal immigrants 
use such I.D. cards to obtain work in the United States. Agents say 
phony documents from this ring already have turned up in 80 different 
cities. We believe it's the largest seizure that I.N.S. has ever had 
throughout the United States. And it's very, very significant in a 
number of ways. Not just in the number of documents that were seized, 
but also in the fact that we have now arrested the ring leader of 
the operation. That suspect, 30-year-old Juan San German, was arrested 
in connection with a 1995 warrant out of Texas. Federal agents say 
German's group has been operating for at least six years. German will 
be extradited to Texas before being returned to California to face 
charges. Along with possession and transfer of counterfeit documents, 
I.N.S. agents say federal racketeering, money laundering and felony 
gun charges have been filed. Jennifer Auther, CNN, Los Angeles.
