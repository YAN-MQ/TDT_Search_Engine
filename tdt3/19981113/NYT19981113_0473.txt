The spate of revivals of plays from the middle of the century over 
the last couple of seasons has confirmed the enduring merit of the 
innovative and imaginative work of playwrights like Camus, Sartre, 
Beckett and Ionesco. But it has also shown that civilization, as we 
optimistically call it, is just as absurd as the 20th century draws 
to a close as it was four or five decades ago. The latest example 
is a worthwhile staging of Ionesco's ``Rhinoceros'' by the Jean Cocteau 
Repertory. Written in the 1950s with another generation's fanaticism 
still in the playwright's mind, ``Rhinoceros'' was first staged in 
1960 and made a splash on Broadway a year later with Zero Mostel in 
the role of Jean, the hero Berenger's best friend, who metamorphoses 
from a human into a rhinoceros before the audience's eyes. But the 
play is still a caution against any stampede into a mindless conformity 
_ be it collectivism, nationalism or fundamentalism _ and modern audiences 
can choose their favorite -ism with which to draw comparisons. The 
play quite simply concerns the transformation of a quiet, peaceful 
town into anarchy when one after another of its citizens is transmuted 
into a lumbering, thick-skinned brute. Only Berenger, a character 
in several Ionesco plays and a stand-in for the playwright, holds 
out against the rush into rhinocerism. First, the townspeople notice 
a stray rhinoceros rumbling down the street. But no one takes a great 
deal of notice (``It made a lot of dust.'' ``Stupid quadruped not 
worth talking about.''), although it does trample one woman's cat. 
But before long the entire town is joining the herd, and the ethical 
debates over the rhino way of life versus the human way of life are 
muted into blind acceptance of the rhino ethic. ``Why not just leave 
them alone,'' a friend advises Berenger. ``You get used to it.'' Eve 
Adamson, the estimable director, mines the salient parts of the play 
with her usual aplomb. But if parts of the Cocteau staging seem to 
move slowly, the playwright must take his share of blame. Ionesco 
was a master of the extended one-act like ``The Chairs'' and ``The 
Lesson,'' but as he turned to full-length plays some of the dialogue 
began to sound forced and unnecessarily padded. A wonderfully comic 
little scene in which a logician sets about proving Socrates was a 
cat works well but goes on far too long, as does much of the debate 
over whether it is the one-horned rhino or the two-horned rhino that 
comes from Africa. Repetitions diminish some of the humor and have 
the effect of underlining the message. Two Cocteau veterans take on 
the key roles of Berenger and Jean. Harris Berlinsky delivers an understated 
yet credible reading of the one-man resistance movement, and Craig 
Smith is ferocious as Jean, his friend who changes into the rhino. 
Tracey Atkins, Christopher Black and Patrick Hall all offer good turns 
in supporting roles. Christopher Martin's sound design convincingly 
simulates a herd of rhinos in the Cocteau lobby. PRODUCTION NOTES:
