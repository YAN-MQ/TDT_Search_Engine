When the computer game industry envisions the holiday season, it sees 
fighter aces, Al Capone and a bizarre Swamp Thing-like creature called 
Abe. Those are just a few of the characters that the game companies 
are counting on for a lift at the end of a year that has been only 
slightly more rewarding than a player's computer freezing just as 
the final goal is in sight. It is not that players have been deprived 
of new diversions this year. But the picture has not been captivating 
for investors. The industry's midsized stalwarts, including Activision 
Inc., the GT Interactive Software Corp. and Eidos PLC of Britain, 
have seen their stocks decline or post only meager gains since Jan. 
1. And many of the electronic game stocks that have risen, including 
those of Acclaim Entertainment Inc. and the 3DO Co., have done so 
from base prices of less than $5 a share. It has not helped that two 
of the industry's most important developers _ Blizzard Entertainment 
and Sierra Online _ are owned by the Cendant Corp., which has been 
roiled by disclosures of accounting irregularities. The stock of Electronic 
Arts Inc., the industry's dominant company, has returned 13.7 percent 
this year. Much of the problem has been that a game company's quarterly 
performance can often ride on a single title, in much the same way 
that a movie studio's fortunes wax and wane with each new film. ``The 
Street is accustomed to asking for forecasts 12 to 14 months in advance, 
and that can be tough to provide, because there is an intersection 
of the business with the creative process,'' said Ronald Chaimowitz, 
chairman of GT Interactive. Chaimowitz is counting on Abe, the creature, 
to make a success of one of GT's main titles, Abe's Exodus. Robert 
A. Kotick, Activision's chief executive, pointed out that only as 
companies become large do they gain the ability to manage their business 
effectively by shuffling projects. For instance, when Sin, a highly 
anticipated Activision game, failed to materialize last quarter, the 
company was able to rush out a package of remakes of old Atari games 
to fill its place. ``Before, we would not have been able to do that, 
because you don't have enough to work with,'' Kotick said. Now, Activision 
is depending on Sin to jump-start its holiday sales. Investors have 
taken note. ``There's a flight to quality among investors that's favoring 
companies with extremely good execution and predictability,'' said 
Lawrence F. Marcus, an analyst for BT Alex. Brown in San Francisco. 
``This holiday season should be strong.'' Marcus predicts that the 
stock of Electronic Arts, now at $43, will reach $51 in 6 to 12 months. 
His target for Activision, now trading at $13.5625, is $18. Stephen 
S. Fleming, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens, has a six-month 
target of $11 on Acclaim, which closed on Friday at $8.6875. The holiday 
season will give each game company a chance to make 1998 a success. 
Last year, for instance, the fourth calendar quarter provided about 
81 percent of Electronic Arts' earnings for its fiscal year, which 
ended in March. With less than two weeks until the start of the holiday 
shopping season, many are cuddling up in the warmth of optimism. ``When 
all the returns are in and we look at the sell-through results for 
the full calendar year,'' said Lawrence F. Probst III, chairman of 
Electronic Arts, ``I think this will be the biggest year in the history 
of the video game industry.''
