Western governments are urging their citizens to leave Iraq, as tension 
mounts between Baghdad and the United Nations. Britain, Germany and 
Italy have all told their nationals to leave Iraq as soon as possible. 
Meanwhile the United Nations has completed the evacuation of most 
of its staff from Baghdad. The last 25 UN workers departed Thursday, 
leaving behind only about 50 staff to oversee the "Oil for Food" program. 
More than two-hundred other humanitarian workers are still in the 
Curdish region of northern Iraq, which has been outside Baghdad's 
control since the 1991 Gulf War.
