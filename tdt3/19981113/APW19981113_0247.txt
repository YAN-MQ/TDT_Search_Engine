A grenade was hurled Friday at an Israeli military outpost in downtown 
Hebron, but failed to go off, an army officer said. In response, the 
army imposed a curfew on the downtown area of Hebron, confining some 
30,000 Palestinians to their homes. The 450 Jewish settlers in Hebron 
do not have to observe the curfew. The incident occurred shortly after 
Friday noon prayers in Gross Square which is heavily patrolled by 
Israeli soldiers. An assailant threw a grenade at an Israeli checkpoint, 
but the device did not go off. Israeli soldiers fired several shots 
in the air. They later ordered bystanders to leave to allow sappers 
to detonate the hand grenade. In a similar incident in September, 
an activist in the Islamic militant group Hamas threw two hand grenades 
at a group of Israeli soldiers in Gross Square. A dozen soldiers and 
several Palestinian civilians were injured. The assailant was later 
arrested by Israel. Hebron is a divided city of 130,000 Palestinians 
and 450 Jewish settlers. Israel controls the downtown area. str-kl
