Passionate differences over a bill aimed at giving legal status to 
unmarried couples could delay its passage by France's parliament for 
up to a year, the newspaper Le Monde reported Friday. The Civil Solidarity 
Pact, known as PACS, has faced fierce opposition from critics who 
have equated the bill with gay marriage. Leftist politicians say they 
now want to proceed with caution, Le Monde reported, after conservative 
lawmakers delayed the bill's passage last week with a procedural battle. 
Thousands of people from around France also have marched against the 
proposal. The bill was initially scuttled by rightist politicians 
Oct. 9 after they launched a fight to quash the legislation. The government 
of Socialist Prime Minister has since revised the bill. According 
to Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou's office, hopes that the bill 
could be approved in June _ as originally planned _ are ``blissfully 
optimistic,'' Le Monde said. Opponents, who fear the bill could also 
open the door to adoptions by homosexual couples, made themselves 
heard during a march against the proposal in the streets of Paris 
last Saturday. The new bill would allow two unrelated people to conclude 
a union that would, among other things, allow them to file joint tax 
returns, gain inheritance benefits, and take part in the other's social 
security coverage.
