Surging earnings and soaring sales at Dell computer, but investors 
were not impressed. They sent the high-flying stock down -- 5 1/4. 
Even though Dell's quarterly profits jumped 55%. The company credited 
part of that gain to its rapidly rising sales made over the Internet. 
Dell has been the company that's led the transition to lower cost 
methods of selling. The Internet is the ultimate direct model for 
us, and we see a clear path to over 50% of our business being transacted 
over the Internet. That is going to happen over the next couple of 
years.
