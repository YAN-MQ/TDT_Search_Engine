The European Under-18 Championships qualifying tournament scheduled 
to take place in Israel next week has been canceled because of security 
concerns, the Jerusalem Post reported Friday. UEFA canceled the events 
Thursday after the English team said it would not attend because of 
the tense situation in the Gulf, the paper reported. The U.S. has 
been stepping up preparations for a military strike against Iraq. 
During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional 
warheads at Israeli cities. England, Israel, Andorra and Spain were 
to compete in the tournament. A new date and venue have not yet been 
announced. The finals are scheduled to be played in Sweden next summer.
