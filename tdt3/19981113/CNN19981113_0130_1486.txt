Meryl Streep says many elements drew her to her latest project, a 
rather small film with big themes. Jim Moret reports. It is an intimate 
glimpse into the lives of five sisters living together in Ireland 
in the 1930s. Wouldn't it be a good one if we all went? Went where? 
To the harvest dance. I'm game. By Hollywood standards, "dancing at 
lughnasa" is a small film, but it attracted a major star -- two-time 
Oscar winner, ten-time nominee meryl Streep, who plays the matriarch 
of the family, Kate. What attracted me to the piece was that the piece 
was so beautiful and unusual -- I mean, really unusual in the landscape 
of movies that are around. That landscape was shaped by director Pat 
O'Connor, who blended the sweeping beauty of Ireland with the personal 
portraits of these complex sisters who together raise the illegitimate 
son of the hopelessly romantic christina, played by Catherine McCormack. 
So Michael is a love child. A son conceived in love. I'm glad you 
have a child conceived in love, Agnes. He's not mine, he's Christina's. 
Jack, he's mine. All of you, you all love him. He belongs to all of 
you. I wanted to see if I could fit myself in again to an ensemble, 
not, you know, necessarily carry a movie in the way that there are 
subsidiary characters and then you're sort of the prow of the ship. 
I like the idea of fitting in and around and having different encounters 
with everybody and all of our stories being interwoven. I knew that 
she would be able to do what she said, talked about earlier, integrating 
into a group of actors without bringing an aura of Hollywood or major 
stardom with it. She left it at the door, which is very, very important 
for the other actors. And according to Streep, it's those actors' 
trust in the director which gave them each the confidence to Bare 
all emotionally. He has a great eye, an unerring taste. So you never 
felt, you know, that something -- occasionally, when you act badly, 
which I very rarely do -- but once in a while, there's a piece in 
there I never want to see. And I know, I have the sense that it will 
never be in the movie. The director is hopeful that what is in the 
movie is a blend of romance, humor, tragedy and uplifting spirit to 
make "dancing at lughnasa" a truly moving motion picture. Jim Moret,
