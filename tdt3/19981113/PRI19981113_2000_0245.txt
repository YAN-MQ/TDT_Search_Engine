There are new warnings that food shortages in North Korea are worsening 
following several years of famine. Ohio congressman Tony Hall is back 
from a fourth visit to the country. He says the situation is critical, 
so bad that some people are forced to eat leaves and twigs to stay 
alive. As you drive through the countryside, one of the things that 
you notice is the tremendous number of gravestones that have popped 
up just in the last two years. And they're new grave markers because 
they're very, very white. Congressman Tony Hall.
