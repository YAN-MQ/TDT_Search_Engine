In all of the rhetoric and second guessing, what may get lost is what 
is at the heart of this dispute -- Saddam Hussein's large, lethal 
and illegal arsenal a collection of weapons capable of mass destruction. 
More on what Saddam has been up to and why the world is so concerned 
from NBC's Andrea Mitchell. The threat of germ warfare. January 31st, 
1991. The gulf war. The U.S. fires cruise missiles at an unmanned 
Iraqi MiG 21, suspected of carrying deadly Anthrax aimed at American 
troops. That kind of biological weapon is exactly what the U.S. and 
U.N. fear most tonight. There are some very devastating -- some very 
devastating agents that are being developed there. U.N. inspectors 
did blow up Iraq's germ warfare laboratories two years ago. But according 
to this recent intelligence report to the Senate, Iraq can restart 
biological weapon production virtually overnight at facilities that 
currently produce vaccines. Setting up a facility to produce something 
like Anthrax is just about as complicated as setting up a microbrewery. 
The U.S. also worries that Saddam has hidden chemical weapons and 
missiles. U.S. officials believe Iraq has put all of its critical 
weapons data on nine computer "zip disks" like this one, leaving virtually 
no paper trail. And making it easy for Saddam to rebuild his weapons 
as soon as the last U.S. bomb has fallen. Andrea Mitchell, NBC news, 
Washington.
