I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"CNN Headline News" forecast. Another winter storm moves into the 
pacific northwest Friday morning, with the big story being the heavy 
rain over Texas once again. We could see flooding in Texas and into 
western Louisiana by Saturday morning. Other than that, a beautiful 
24-hour period over most of the west and the east, thanks to high 
pressure. But very cold temperatures and snow showers in the northern 
Great Lakes. High temperatures on Friday, very chilly, we're talking 
30s for highs in the northern plains and the Great Lakes, as well 
as New England. Other than that, high temperatures will be mild to 
cool throughout the U.S. your extended forecast showing rain in the 
northwest, with scattered showers and thunderstorms in the east on 
Saturday. Cold air moves into the northern Great Lakes in New England, 
with highs in the 30s on Sunday, with showers in the north and snow 
in New England, with showers in the southeast. Showers and thunderstorms 
Monday in the east and in the northwest, with those cold temperatures 
continuing. And remember, you can get your four-day forecast for more 
than 7,200 cities at CNN.com.
