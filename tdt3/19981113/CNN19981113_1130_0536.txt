federal agents have seized millions of counterfeit documents in los 
angeles. as jennifer auther reports, the illegal papers were meant 
for illegal immigrants. u.s. immigration and naturalization says the 
largest counterfeit document raid in the agency's history occurred 
here, at a 12' x 10' storage shed just outside downtown los angeles. 
special agents confiscated 2 million phony government documents. the 
tuesday night raid uncovered drivers' licenses from california, colorado 
and several other states. social security cards. resident alien cards. 
permanent resident, or green cards. printing equipment and more. we 
found several major credit card companies that we're working with, 
have documented losses in excess of $3 million, where these identification 
documents were used to cash stolen and counterfeit traveler's checks 
and credit cards. according to the i.n.s., 12 people have been arrested 
since august. more arrests are expected. this is an organized crime 
group, comprised of predominately mexican nationals. the phony documents 
sell on the street for anywhere from $40 to $100. illegal immigrants 
use such i.d. cards to obtain work in the united states. agents say 
phony documents from this ring already have turned up in 80 different 
cities. it's very, very significant in a number of ways. not just 
in the number of documents, but also in the fact that we have now 
arrested the ringleader of the operation. that suspect, 30-year-old 
juan san german, was arrested in connection with a 1995 warrant issued 
out of texas. federal agents say german's group has been operating 
for at least six years. german will be extradited to texas before 
being returned to california to face charges including federal racketeering, 
money laundering and felony gun possession. jennifer auther, cnn,
