Colts running back Craig "ironhead" Heyward remains in serious but 
stable condition today following 13 hours of surgery yesterday to 
remove a benign brain tumor. In a statement released today by the 
hospital, doctors say they were unable to remove the entire tumor 
from the 32-year-old NFL veteran. John Elway will remain on the sidelines 
Monday night when the undefeated broncos take on Kansas city. The 
Denver quarterback still suffers from bruised ribs. Randall Cunningham 
hopes to return to the starting lineup Sunday against the bengals. 
The Vikings' qb is listed as probable only days after having bone 
chips removed from his right knee.
