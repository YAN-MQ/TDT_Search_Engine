Experimenting for his third game as Spanish national team coach, Jose 
Antonio Camacho named a roster for next week's friendly against Italy 
that includes five new faces from Mallorca, Espanyol, Atletico de 
Madrid, and Celta. On the 18-man squad list for the first time are 
Daniel ``Dani'' Garcia Lara and Marcelino Elena from Mallorca, Espanyol 
midfielder Ivan Helguera, Atletico de Madrid's Juan Carlos Valeron 
and Celta forward Juan Gines Sanchez. The Nov. 18 friendly against 
Italy takes place in Salerno, near Naples. The Spanish national squad 
is to be dominated by players from Mallorca and Athletic de Bilbao, 
each of which have three representatives. Powerhouses FC Barcelona 
and Real Madrid, who in the past have frequently supplied up to 10 
players, are left with only one each: striker Raul Gonzalez from Madrid 
and defender Sergi Barjuan from Barcelona. Since Camacho, a former 
Real Madrid player, became national coach last month, Spain has defeated 
Russia 1-0 in a friendly game and Israel 2-1 in the European qualifiers. 
The squad also includes keeper Santiago Canizares of Valencia; Agustin 
Aranzabal of Real Sociedad; Jordi Lardin of Atletico de Madrid; Toni 
Gomez of Espanyol; Michel Salgado of Celta; Mallorca's Vicente Engonga; 
Francisco De Pedro from Real Sociedad; Joseba Exteberria, Bittor Alkiza 
and Ismael Urzaiz of Athletic de Bilbao; and Paco Jemez of Zaragoza.
