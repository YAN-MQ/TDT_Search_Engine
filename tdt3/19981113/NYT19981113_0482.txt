Tex Johnston, a storied test pilot who ushered in the age of jet travel 
with such a heart-stopping flourish that some people in Seattle and 
the world of aviation are still shaking their heads, died on Oct. 
29 at a nursing home in Mount Vernon, Wash. He was 84 and was recalled 
as the man who blithely barrel-rolled the United States' first jetliner 
into aviation history. His family said the cause was Alzheimer's disease. 
With a quarter-million spectators gathered on Lake Washington for 
the Gold Cup hydroplane races and air show at the 1955 Seattle Seafair, 
no one was expecting anything special from Boeing Airplane Co.'s chief 
test pilot that August afternoon, least of all the Boeing executives 
clustered on a barge surrounded by the heads of virtually every major 
airline in the world to watch a routine flyover by a prototype of 
the company's new aircraft. For one thing, Johnston, or Alvin Melvin 
Johnston, as the drawling test pilot was known to virtually no one, 
had already had his brush with aviation glory. Eight years earlier 
as chief test pilot for Bell Aviation, the lanky pilot in his signature 
custom-made cowboy boots had tested the company's famous X-1 rocket 
plane, becoming the first to fly the B-29-launched craft using all 
four rockets and taking it, he later recalled, to Mach .99, a whisper 
shy of the sound barrier. He held off because the Air Force, which 
owned the plane, had insisted that a military pilot have the honor 
of being the first to fly at supersonic speed, as indeed Capt. Chuck 
Yeager did in 1947. If he had been disappointed at missing out on 
that bit of aviation history, Johnston didn't let on. After all, what 
had kept him in the air almost constantly since he soloed at the age 
of 15 in an open cockpit Waco monoplane was not the chance for glory 
but the sheer, exuberant joy he had first tasted at 11 one summer 
afternoon in 1925. On that day a barnstorming pilot landed a World 
War I Jenny in a cow pasture next to the Johnston family farm in Admire, 
Kan., outside Emporia, and took the youngster on a short hop that 
left him hooked on flying forever. As he recalled in his 1991 book, 
``Tex Johnston: Jet-Age Test Pilot,'' he had been so smitten that 
he grabbed the pilot's hand and blurted out: ``I love you. I'm going 
to be just like you.'' It took some doing, but by the time he joined 
Boeing in 1949, Johnston had long since won his aviation spurs, performing 
aerial stunts for a flying circus at 19, training pilots and ferrying 
airplanes from factories to military airfields in World War II, and 
even earning a few footnotes to aviation history. He became the first 
pilot to fly the famous Bell XP-59A, the first American jet, above 
40,000 feet, and set a world closed course speed record of 376.4 mph 
in winning the 1946 Thompson Trophy race in Cleveland in a modified 
P-39. As Boeing's chief of test flights he had reached the pinnacle 
of his profession, supervising a staff of 600, including 15 other 
pilots, while continuing his personal achievements, among them flying 
the first B-47 and the first B-52 on their maiden flights. On Aug. 
7, 1955, the day Johnston was asked to fly over Lake Washington in 
a giant four-engine Boeing jet prototype designated 367-80 and commonly 
known as the Dash 80, Boeing was host of the annual meetings of the 
International Air Transport Association and the American Society of 
Aeronautical Engineers, and virtually every potential customer for 
its planes was represented. Boeing executives understandably wanted 
them to get a good look at the plane on which the company had staked 
its future, investing a quarter of its corporate net worth without 
a single advance order. Well, they did. Johnston pulled on his cowboy 
boots, climbed into the Dash 80 and roared in low across the lake. 
At 400 feet above the water and at a speed of more than 400 mph, the 
Dash 80 suddenly started climbing and began rotating on its axis. 
Its long, swept-back wings described a giant spiral around the body 
of the speeding plane, which flew briefly upside down in its slow, 
languid roll. Then, just in case no one had noticed, he did it again. 
On the barge, aviation executives gasped. The Boeing president, William 
Allen, asked a friend with a heart ailment for his pills. His distress 
was understandable. Barrel rolls performed by small fighter planes 
and the like were common enough, but no one had ever seen one executed 
by a 128-foot-long, 160,000-pound plane with four heavy jet engines 
and a 130-foot wing span. But then, no one had ever seen a Boeing 
707, as the Dash 80's offspring would soon be known, a plane whose 
pilot had participated in every facet of its design and construction 
and knew, as those gasping below could not, that it could well withstand 
the surprisingly minimal stresses caused by the demonstration. Or, 
as an aviation friend reassuringly told Allen, ``Tex has just sold 
your plane for you.'' Indeed, by the time Johnston set a transcontinental 
speed record in 1957 of 612 miles an hour flying the Dash 80 from 
Seattle to Baltimore in three hours, 48 minutes, the orders were pouring 
in, as they continued to do over the next two decades. Johnston was 
inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, in 1993. 
He is survived by a son, Gary, of Edmonds, Wash.; two daughters, Judy 
Alexander of Bellevue, Wash., and Barbara Fowler of Lompoc, Calif.; 
nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
