Jewish leaders from abroad are showing up in full force for a series 
of conventions and gatherings this month, despite a U.S. government 
recommendation to tourists to stay away from the region, a Jewish 
Agency official said Friday. The Israeli army operated extra gas mask 
distribution stations in Israel on Friday for the second day in a 
row, as Israeli officials expected a U.S. attack on Iraq in the coming 
days. About 3,000 Jewish leaders are expected in Jerusalem for several 
gatherings and conventions, said organizers. ``There have been no 
cancellations,'' said Michael Jankelowitz, spokesman of the Jewish 
Agency which raises funds and co-ordinates immigration of Jews to 
Israel. ``This is the third time (Iraqi ruler) Saddam Hussein has 
done this, and people aren't getting scared,'' he said. Jankelowitz 
said Jewish leaders abroad have been calling others already here to 
check on the situation. ``They hear that life is going on normally 
here,'' said Jankelowitz. ``That is the reason there is no drop in 
participation, despite the State Department travel advisory.'' Among 
the events scheduled for November is the first-ever session in Israel 
of leaders from local Jewish federations and the United Jewish Appeal 
fund-raising drive. The gathering, known as the General Assembly, 
usually convenes in the United States.
