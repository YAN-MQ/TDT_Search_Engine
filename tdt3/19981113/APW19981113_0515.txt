Armed Serb civilians swapped hostages Friday with ethnic Albanian 
guerrillas in the Kosovo province, amid reports that Serb police shot 
and killed an ethnic Albanian in a central village. All three sides 
_ Kosovo Albanians, Serb officials and international monitors who 
intervened to defuse the crisis _ confirmed that two Serb civilians 
held since Wednesday by the separatist guerillas were released in 
exchange for the seven ethnic Albanians remaining in Serb custody. 
The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting Wednesday, 
by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring Montenegro, Serbia's 
much smaller partner in the Yugoslav republic. The armed hostage-takers 
were seeking the release of two people missing from the central Drenica 
region, a trouble spot throughout much of this year's eight-month 
crackdown by Serb forces on guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo, 
the Albanian-majority Serbian province. The exchanges took place at 
Leposavic, a village close to the border with Montenegro, shortly 
after midnight, said the sources. Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo 
village of Mlecane, eyewitness said Serb police opened fire on a group 
of ethnic Albanian men and children, killing one of the men and injuring 
another. The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian 
leadership, also carried the report. According to a witness, six police 
pulled up in an unmarked car Thursday and opened fire on the group. 
The children fled unharmed, but the gunfire killed a 40-year-old man 
who was paralyzed on one side. Another man was wounded in the arm. 
Journalists visiting Mlecane on Friday saw two pools of blood amid 
15-20 scattered machine gun shells where the incident reportedly took 
place. Male villagers, who only recently returned to the homes they 
left earlier, said all the women and children had fled again. ``We 
aren't normal folks anymore. Whenever we see a car, we run away because 
we're afraid,'' said Ismajl Gashi, 40. He said the men were also considering 
leaving. The detentions and continued shootings have chipped away 
at hopes for a solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians, ushered in by an Oct. 12 agreement. The Serb crackdown 
on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province has left hundreds dead, 
mostly ethnic Albanians civilians, and made refugees of hundreds of 
thousands more. In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim 
Rugova told Serbs _ who make up less than 10 percent of the province 
_ that they had nothing to fear from the October agreement, ultimately 
aimed at restoring wide-ranging Albanian autonomy in Kosovo. ``All 
Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he told reporters.
