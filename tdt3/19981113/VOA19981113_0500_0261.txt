The United Nations is increasing emergency shipments of food to victims 
of Hurricane Mitch in Central America. The UN World Food Program announced 
it's beginning a $58 million operation to bring food to people in 
Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador. The organization says, 
the aid will provide six months of nutritional relief for victims 
of the storm, which has left more than 11,000 people dead. World Food 
Program officials say the victims are at great nutritional risk. Among 
those visiting the area is Actor Edward James Olmos, who is in Honduras 
as an ambassador for the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF. Mr. Olmos says 
the needs are for quite sometime. This is a long-term commitment, 
when one steps into this arena. This is not a, "Oh shoot, let's go 
over there and let's try to help." And then when you leave, you drop 
off X-amount of dollars, economical help, or attention, and then leave. 
We have a real need to understand the amount of energy that has to 
go into his place consistently, over the next years. Not just this 
month.
