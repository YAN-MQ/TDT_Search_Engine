The United States is preparing for an invasion of sorts from outer 
space. No little green men. Instead, tiny meteors will shower earth. 
Rick Lockridge reports in this edition of "tech trends." As the U.S. 
military beefs up its numbers in the Middle East, U.S. space command 
is beefing up, too, for the Leonid meteor shower. On Tuesday, November 
17th, the earth will pass through a cloud of sand-grain-sized meteors 
traveling through space 100 times faster than speeding bullets, fast 
enough to possibly damage military satellites in orbit. These are 
the basic backbone of our ability to carry out our military missions 
worldwide and warn of impending attack. Colonel Pete worden will be 
monitoring the meteor shower for the military from Asia, where viewing 
is best. He talked with us about the leonids' threat to satellites 
before he left. Over the last couple of years, there has been intensive 
efforts by the air force space command to assess the threat that we 
might have, and they've concluded that there is potentially a serious 
threat and that we needed to take it seriously and figure out ways 
to mitigate that threat. The meteor shower comes to us courtesy of 
a Comet called tempel tuttle, which orbits the sun once every 33 years. 
Every November, the earth passes through some part of the Comet's 
long trail of debris. Since tempel tuttle's orbit brought it close 
to the earth this year, the shower should be especially intense. No 
one knows for sure how the satellites will handle the onslaught, though 
experts say the chances are about 1% that a satellite will get hit. 
The impact could physically damage the satellite or cause an electrical 
charge to form. And that could travel along areas of the satellite 
and then get into a Critical component and burn it out. Space command 
says it has contingency plans ready in the event a Satellite is damaged, 
including the use of backup satellites already in orbit. The national 
reconnaissance office, which controls U.S. spy satellites, says it's 
working with space command to monitor the storm and take actions as 
necessary to protect U.S. national security. Rick Lockridge, CNN.
