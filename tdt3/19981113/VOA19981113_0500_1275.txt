A member of the Executive Committee of the world's governing body 
has traveled to Central America to determine what aid FIFA can offer 
to victims of Hurricane Mitch. Anhelga Maria Villar, who is also the 
President of the Spanish Football Federation flew to Nicaragua, Thursday, 
for a first hand look at the needs of that country, and Honduras. 
He is expected to be joined by Saso Saso Costa Rica's member of the 
FIFA committee. The two will report back to the world football organization 
in time for its meeting on December 3rd in Zurich, where appropriate 
action will be decided. Aid is also expected to be sent to the football 
associations of other countries effected by Mitch.
