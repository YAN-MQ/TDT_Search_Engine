The prime ministers of Russia and Japan meet today following reports 
of progress in solving a territorial dispute over four islands in 
the Kuril chain. The long running dispute over control of the islands 
north of Japan has prevented the two countries from signing a peace 
treaty, since the end of World War II. On Thursday, Russia proposed 
joint economic development of the islands. A Japanese spokesman later 
said, the countries now appear to be on the path to a treaty by the 
year 2000.
