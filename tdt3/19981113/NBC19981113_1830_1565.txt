In central America, the president of Honduras warned today that unless 
his beleaguered country receives massive aid and a forgiveness of 
much of its foreign debt, the Honduran people will have no choice 
but to head north into the United States. As it stands now, there's 
a kind of reverse migration pattern -- good samaritans from the U.S. 
headed into central the "home of the brave." Here's NBC's George Lewis. 
Blaring from a loud speaker in an airplane. The pilot telling people 
below not to give up hope. He's American missionary Mike Heinz, flying 
over the most devastated parts of Honduras, assuring those on the 
ground that help is on its way. During the height of hurricane Mitch, 
Mike risked his life to fly the church's plane out of here so it wouldn't 
be destroyed by the high winds. Mike and his wife Karen were sent 
to Latin America 38 years ago by at semablys of God church. Karen 
gets to work dangling from a flimsy wire basket suss spind suspended 
by a cable 50 feet above the earth. That's how you get around when 
the bridges are out. Even the sick and injured have to travel this 
way. On the other side of the river, Karen welcomes a team of doctors 
to the clinic she's set up for hurricane victims. With thousands of 
houses leveled on the ground, Karen took in 14 of the homeless and 
had to brave the floodwaters in order to feed them. I was up almost 
to my chest wading down to the middle of the road to get to a suber 
market to get supplies. What was that like? A little scary. The Churches 
that have missions in Honduras organized food drives to combat staveation 
in the hardest hit areas. Mike flies to us one of those areas, this 
island, once covered with pine trees. The greenery was fantastic. 
It was a healing to your eyes. Now there are only barren hillsides 
and devastated villages. Do you think you try to build again with 
lumber? If they decide to rebuild, Mike promises to help. In everys 
to relieve suffering, the heinzs have been going day and night, even 
rescuing a stray kitten and naming him Mitch. Back in the air, Mike 
asking people below if they want to be remembered in prayer. If so, 
use a mirror and flash me a signal. All a sudden, twinkles of light 
appearing from everywhere. A sign, Mike says, the people below haven't 
lost faith or hope. He and his wife toil nonstop on the charity plot. 
George Lewis, NBC news, Honduras.
