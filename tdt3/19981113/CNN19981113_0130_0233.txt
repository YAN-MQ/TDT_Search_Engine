Indiana senator Richard Lugar says military strikes are likely, but 
he wants more. Lugar is urging the administration to consider a follow-up 
to remove Saddam hussein from power. Pennsylvania senator Arlen specter 
wants President Clinton to seek approval from Congress before he orders 
any attack on Iraq. The president has all but declared an impending 
missile strike, and it is an act of war, and I believe the constitution 
requires that Congress authorize an act of war before it is entered 
into. It is true that it appears to be an imminent matter, but the 
Congress can be called into special session. The president has full 
power to do that. State department spokesman James Rubin dismisses 
specter's demand, saying the president has inherent authority to use 
force.
