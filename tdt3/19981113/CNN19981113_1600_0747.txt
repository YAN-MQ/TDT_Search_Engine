The day's top stories are two minutes away, followed by the closing 
numbers from Wall Street in "Dollars & Sense." And still ahead -- 
whose body was that in Jesse Ventura's campaign commercials for governor 
of Minnesota? If you could accompany your data on its trip overseas 
the experience would be alarming. Local carriers handing it to national 
carriers over to cable carriers... till you don't know who has your 
data. Unless you send it through here. With the one and only company 
that owns the entire network-- local, national, and international. 
So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Because 
even though they're both chewable they work in totally different ways. 
Tums' calcium na turally, rapidly neutralizes acid so it works fast. 
Chewable pepcid's famotidine has to travel through your bloodstream 
so it takes 40 minutes just to start working. So why does tums work 
faster and cost less and chewable pepcid work slower and cost more?
