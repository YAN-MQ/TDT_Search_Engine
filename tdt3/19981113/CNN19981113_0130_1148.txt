"CNN Headline Sports" is next. And coming up -- why one of the biggest 
names in Hollywood is starring in a Rather small film. If you could 
accompany your data on its trip overseas the experience would be alarming. 
Local carriers handing it to national carriers over to cable carriers... 
till you don't know who has your data. Unless you send it through 
here. With the one and only company that owns the entire network-- 
local, national, and international. So you know who has your data. 
On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Duane Walker "CNN Headline Sports."
