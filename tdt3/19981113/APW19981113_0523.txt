Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will open roundtable talks Dec. 7 with 
industry and labor on ways to put the country's nearly 4 million unemployed 
back to work, the government said Friday. ``This will be a first sizing-up,'' 
of the so-called Alliance for Jobs, said Uwe-Karsten Heye, the chancellor's 
spokesman. The alliance is a key project of Schroeder's government, 
which was elected largely on promises to cut unemployment, now at 
10.1 percent. Along with Schroeder, government ministers attending 
would include Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, Economics Minister 
Werner Mueller and Labor Minister Walter Riester, Heye said. Four 
of Germany's biggest employer's associations and several major unions 
also would attend the talks, which are to continue through the administration's 
entire four-year term, he said. Preliminary talks next Thursday would 
focus on drawing up an agenda, he said. One idea touted recently by 
Schroeder is lowering the official retirement age to 60 to open up 
jobs for younger people. Labor Minister Riester backed the idea Friday. 
``It's a very interesting point of view that should be discussed by 
the alliance,'' Riester said on Suedwestfunk radio. A federal research 
institute has drawn up a jobs creation plan which includes increasing 
public investment, lowering taxes, creating more part-time jobs and 
getting rid of overtime.
