Now that the national orgy of infotainment known as All Monica is 
nearing its end, one network was at last willing to come forward and 
say it has standards and will sin no more. Or so it seemed, for one 
brief but shining moment last week. That moment came when ABC released 
a strong statement expressing how ``increasingly uncomfortable'' it 
has become ``with the confusion (that) could exist between fact-based 
entertainment and hard news.'' The statement continued: ``We came 
to believe that television viewers could find it difficult to distinguish 
between the two forms,'' and that ``fact-based entertainment'' might 
``not be appropriate for a television network with a strong news record 
and identity.'' For those of us who thought ABC News was once tops 
in the game, this was a welcome mea culpa and return to sanity. Surely 
the statement meant that ABC would no longer have its supposedly objective 
Monday-through-Friday Washington reporters Sam Donaldson and Cokie 
Roberts confusingly double as highly biased pundits on Sunday, peddling 
incorrect predictions about President Clinton's fate and moralistic 
homilies about his conduct as fact-based entertainment (hilarious 
though much of it has been). Perhaps the statement meant, too, that 
ABC News shows would no longer sport tie-ins to other Disney products, 
from ``Ellen'' to Animal Kingdom. But no. Through some bizarre slip-up, 
the ABC statement turns out not to apply to ABC News at all but only 
to filmmaker Oliver Stone, whom the network had commissioned on a 
free-lance basis to produce what he calls a ``new-style'' news magazine. 
The network's long-overdue, principled stand was aimed at a single 
segment in that show about the TWA Flight 800 crash _ a segment that 
had not even been filmed. Some news accounts implied that ABC was 
concerned that Stone might want to spread an irresponsible theory 
about the crash, but my conversations with Stone and one of the former 
longtime NBC News producers he hired to do the piece suggest otherwise. 
Stone's aim was to ``investigate the investigation'' of the accident 
and raise unanswered questions, rather than posit any conclusions, 
much in the skeptical manner of the essay by Elaine Scarry, a professor 
at Harvard, in The New York Review of Books over the summer. I have 
my own no doubt half-baked conspiracy theory _ not about TWA 800 but 
about why ABC stood up loudly against a 12-minute story that hadn't 
even been produced yet. By taking the high road against Stone, an 
easy target and not an ABC employee, perhaps the network could deflect 
attention from the dirty laundry in its actual news division, some 
more of which is about to be aired in public. The new issue of Brill's 
Content has put Mickey Mouse on its cover for a story about ABC's 
decision to kill another news magazine story last month _ this one 
for ``20/20,'' by Brian Ross, the network's top investigative reporter. 
Ross' story was about alleged pedophilia at theme parks. The Brill's 
Content story depicts a network at which various executives each have 
different and conflicting policies about how independent the news 
division can be when covering unflattering stories about Disney. ``The 
whole mess validates the viewing public's worst fears about conglomerate 
ownership of major news outlets,'' the story concludes. Brill's Content 
was unable to find a single senior journalist at ABC News ``willing 
to say, even not for attribution, that he or she concurred with the 
editorial judgment'' that led to the killing of Ross' theme-park investigation. 
Like many media critics, Oliver Stone believes that ``to link the 
news to profit is a historical disaster,'' and he dates the phenomenon 
back to Laurence Tisch's short-lived, news-downsizing ownership of 
CBS. That link explains not only why ABC promotes Disney products 
or sometimes hides Disney embarrassments; it explains the entire culture, 
hardly limited to ABC or CBS, that gave us ratings-driven All Monica 
and All Diana and All O.J., and that turns once reputable TV journalists 
into performing seals. It says much about how steep the slide in news 
has been that Stone now has every right to seize the moral high ground: 
while he, too, has provided feverish, speculative entertainment about 
an American president or two, he has never pretended to be a journalist 
while doing so.
