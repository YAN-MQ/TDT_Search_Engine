KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting and consulting firm, has dropped 
a lawsuit accusing a rival, Stern Stewart &AMP; Co., of unfairly trying 
to stifle competition. ``During this past year, Stern Stewart has 
apparently ceased the activities which forced KPMG to commence this 
lawsuit,'' KPMG said in a statement. ``Since its goal has effectively 
been accomplished, KPMG believes there is no reason for further processing 
of the claims.'' Stern Stewart disputed the KPMG account Friday. ``Our 
position from the beginning has been that KPMG's suit was utterly 
without merit,'' the firm said in a statement. ``Stern Stewart never 
engaged in unfair competitive practices, as KPMG originally alleged. 
Nor have we modified our marketing or competitive practices in any 
way, as KPMG now asserts.'' Stern Stewart is a former audit client 
of KPMG. Last year, a New York judge ruled that KPMG had violated 
obligations to Stern Stewart when KPMG entered the same type of consulting 
business. KPMG is appealing that decision.
