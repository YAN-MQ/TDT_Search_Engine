Belgian police on Friday announced they had seized hundreds of kilos 
(pounds) of cocaine from Colombia, hashish from Morocco and locally 
made XTC pills with a combined street value of some dlrs 30 million. 
Three Belgians and five Dutch nationals appeared in court in this 
northeastern Belgian town charged with drug trafficking after justice 
officials held a press conference showing off their catch. Eight others, 
including several British nationals and a Norwegian, still await to 
be formally charged. Karel Cleeren, a spokesman for the Hasselt prosecutor's 
office, said police seized 180 kilos (400 pounds) of Colombian cocaine 
stuffed in shipping containers at the port of Antwerp. The first such 
shipment was discovered Aug. 21. Since then, police have also seized 
950 kilos (2,100 pounds) of hashish from Morocco and 100,000 amphetamine 
pills produced in Belgium. Cleeren put the street value of the drugs 
at about 1 billion Belgian francs (dlrs 28.6 million). The cocaine 
alone was worth almost 600 million francs (dlrs 17 million).
