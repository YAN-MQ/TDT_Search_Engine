BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley on Friday 
urged American businesses to get more involved in the multibillion 
dollar postwar reconstruction of Lebanon, a country once synonymous 
with hijackings and hostage-taking. ``The message I brought is that 
the United States is back and wants to do more business in Lebanon,'' 
Daley said after a meeting with President-elect Emile Lahoud. He said 
he looked forward to encouraging ``U.S. businesses to participate 
in a new and much improved Lebanon.''
