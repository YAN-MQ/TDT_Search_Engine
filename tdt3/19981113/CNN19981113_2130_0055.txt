The lawsuit that shook a presidency has been settled. Today Paula 
Jones agreed to accept $850,000 from President Clinton to drop her 
claim of sexual harassment. Jones expects to receive the money within 
60 days, but she will not receive an apology or an admission of guilt. 
Skip Loescher has more. Was the settlement a victory for Paula Jones? 
Her attorney, Bill McMillan says -- you bet. The president's attorney 
says Mr. Clinton was also pleased. The president does not want to 
spend one more minute on this matter. It all began back in 1991. Paula 
Jones was a state employee and Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas. 
It was in this Little Rock hotel where she claims Mr. Clinton exposed 
himself and propositioned her. He pulled and started running his hand 
up my leg and he tried to Kiss on my neck. It wasn't until three years 
after the alleged incident that Paula jones went public, filing a 
sexual harassment law suit. She asked for $700,000 and a public apology. 
The president said "no," flatly denying her charge. This complaint 
is tabloid trash with a legal caption on it. Bennett went to court, 
contending that a sitting president should not have to defend himself 
against a civil lawsuit. He lost -- the Supreme Court ruling unanimously 
that the Jones trial could go forward. Then, judge Susan weber Wright 
ruled that Jones' lawyers could use evidence of Mr. Clinton's alleged 
extramarital affairs. So last January, the president was sworn in 
to give a deposition in the jones case. Linda Tripp had already told 
the Jones lawyers about Monica Lewinsky, and they questioned Mr. Clinton 
about his encounters with her. I did not have sexual relations with 
that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. Judge Wright later decided the Lewinsky 
matter was irrelevant to the Jones case and dismissed it. Jones appealed 
questions about whether the president may have lied under oath, giving 
her new ammunition. But before the appeals court could rule, the case 
was finally settled. Paula Jones will get $850,000, but President 
Clinton won't apologize. Skip Loescher, Headline News, Washington.
