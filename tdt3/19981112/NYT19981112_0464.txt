Stephen Pierce Duggan, the founding chairman of the Natural Resources 
Defense Council and a leader in the fight that preserved the scenic 
Storm King Mountain from development, died Nov. 18 at Cornwall Hospital 
in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y. A longtime Cornwall resident, he was 89 
and formerly lived in Manhattan as well. The fight over Storm King, 
a landmark towering over the Hudson River, was an important event 
in establishing modern environmental law. Duggan's role in pulling 
together money and influence for that effort eventually led him to 
help establish the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the most 
influential environmental advocacy groups. In the 1960s, air-conditioning 
and other large home appliances were proliferating in the New York 
City area. To meet the surging demand for electricity, Consolidated 
Edison Co. moved to build a power plant in Orange County, on the Hudson 
River and the mountain towering over it, famous as a subject for 19th-century 
writers and the painters of the Hudson River School. The project, 
announced by the utility in 1963, would have carved trenches for pumped 
storage pipelines up the mountainside. Still, most people in the area 
accepted the plan because it meant jobs and an improvement in the 
local economy. But Duggan, a litigator at the big Wall Street law 
firm Simpson, Thacher &AMP; Bartlett, and his wife, Beatrice Abbott 
Duggan, set out to rally those who objected to the project. At first, 
few responded, even though the plant imperiled a striped-bass spawning 
area and Black Rock Forest, the nature preserve atop Storm King. Then 
the power company published a drawing that exaggerated the size of 
the project relative to its surroundings. The Duggans' telephone began 
to ring and soon they and other irate landowners signed on hikers' 
groups and conservationists. The objectors organized the Scenic Hudson 
Preservation Conference and took their case to public hearings. In 
1965, they won a federal court ruling that was a legal landmark: For 
the first time, a conservation group got the right to sue in the public 
interest and to be heard on license applications from utilities. Con 
Edison continued the battle but eventually abandoned the project years 
later. And Duggan emerged from the fight sure of the need for a permanent, 
national environmental organization to tackle such issues. In 1970, 
he, his wife and several others formed the Natural Resources Defense 
Council to marshal the law and research for environmental cases. As 
chairman for a decade, he led the council into such diverse areas 
as the Alaskan wilderness, the health of steelworkers, survival of 
the golden eagle, energy efficiency, chemical pollution and public 
health in the inner cities. In addition, he and his wife brought the 
council's experience to bear on environmental work on an international 
scale. At his death, he remained a trustee of the organization. A 
native of White Plains, N.Y., Stephen Duggan graduated from Phillips 
Exeter Academy and Harvard College. He earned an M.A. at Columbia 
University in 1932 and an L.L.B. from its law school in 1936, and 
went into practice as a litigator in New York. He joined Simpson, 
Thacher &AMP; Bartlett in 1943, rose to senior partner and retired 
as head of its trust and estates department in 1976. He was a longtime 
director of the Institute for International Education, which his father 
founded. At various times he also served on the boards of Phillips 
Exeter, Storm King School, the Collegiate School, Vassar College, 
the New School for Social Research, the Walter Reade Foundation and 
Scenic Hudson. His wife died in 1996. He is survived by three sons, 
Stephen P. III of Cornwall, Peter M. of Charlotte, N.C., and Hayden 
A. of Gardner, Mass.; a daughter, Marianne Bell O'Brien of Jersey 
City; 12 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
