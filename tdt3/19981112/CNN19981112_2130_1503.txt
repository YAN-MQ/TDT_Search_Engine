TV shows catering to young audiences have realized the impact of a 
great song. Now more than ever, TV is alive with the sound of music. 
Ron tank reports. Been listening to your favorite TV show lately? 
Yes, listening. Series like "Sabrina, the teenage witch" are not only 
inviting bands to the set, they're featuring them on soundtrack albums. 
I think it's great to have a soundtrack out, you know, when you've 
had that kind of music on the show. And, you know, the kids at home 
then get to play it whenever they want. Wake up smell the coffee Series 
as different as "south park" and "touched by an Angel" are selling 
CDs that contain songs from the shows. And it's obviously a great 
way to reach an audience that you already know exists. You know that 
people are watching the show. And watching the show, or rather, attracting 
viewers, is the whole idea. Our love's so beautiful "Ally McBeal" 
relies heavily on the songs by vonda shepard. And the 20-something 
show "Melrose place" also uses music regularly to help create a mood. 
Just like in films, I mean, you go see a movie, the score or the music 
has such a huge effect on you. Playback. But it's more than that. 
This "Melrose place" episode includes the alternative band "push monkey." 
Not Coincidentally, the song they're playing is their new single. 
It's just a really good experience for a band like us. It's gonna 
really support the airplay that we're getting on the song. a Paula 
Cole song became the theme for "Dawson's Creek," benefiting both the 
artist and the series. I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over 
Every time the song was played on the radio, it was essentially a 
free commercial for the show. Speaking of commercials, the WB network 
actually advertises the songs featured on several of its series, including 
"felicity." Tonight's "felicity" featured music from ostero, Liz phair. 
We have that opportunity to put the visual of the CD right there on 
the show. And we think it's a service to the viewers as well as a 
service to the record labels. It's not so much commercial and then 
TV, they're just kind of mixing so many different formats in one. 
It's a win/win situation, for the shows and the bands. And plus, we 
love the show, all of us. It's a good chance to meet, you know, Melissa. 
The star of "Sabrina" returned the favor, helping out at a local concert. 
Phantom planet! Cross promotion at its best. Ron tank, "CNN Entertainment 
News," Hollywood.
