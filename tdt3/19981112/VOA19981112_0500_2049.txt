The head of Indonesia's armed forces has issued an apology for soldiers 
who beat protesters and three journalists on Wednesday. General Relanto 
has said those who committed the offenses will be punished. However, 
he also criticized a student who drove his car into riot police injuring 
nine. The violence occurred as students and other activists were marching 
to the parliament building to protest against a special session of 
the Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest legislative body. 
The assembly is meeting this week to consider political reforms. However, 
critics are skeptical. The assembly will produce meaningful reforms 
placing it just too closely linked with Mr. Suharto.
