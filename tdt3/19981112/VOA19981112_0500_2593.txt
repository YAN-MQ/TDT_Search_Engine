Britain's highest court is expected to finish hearing arguments today 
on whether the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto 
Pinochet was illegal. The House of Lords is considering an appeal 
of a lower court ruling that said the former dictator has immunity 
from prosecution as a former head of state. On Wednesday, Britain 
received a formal Spanish government request for the general's extradition. 
The Swiss Embassy also initiated similar moves joining other European 
countries taking legal action against him for human rights abuses 
committed under his rule.
