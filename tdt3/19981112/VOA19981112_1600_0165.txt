U.S. and Palestinian officials have reacted sharply to Israeli moves 
to build more than 1,000 homes at a disputed site in Arab East Jerusalem. 
The Israeli land authority and the housing ministry invited contractors 
to bid for the right to build on the hill called Harhoma by Israel 
and Jebelabuganin the Palestinians. U.S. officials described the move 
as inconsistent with the spirit of the Wye River peace agreement. 
Palestinian leaders warned the Israeli action will have dangerous 
consequences.
