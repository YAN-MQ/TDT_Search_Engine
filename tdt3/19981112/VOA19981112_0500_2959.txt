Japan unveiled its latest plan to boost the economy out of recession 
Thursday, a $164 billion spending plan that includes some tax cuts. 
Many economists and analysts do not believe the package will do what 
the government says it will do, which is raise the economy out of 
recession. They say earlier packages that failed to do the job. So 
what's needed? That's the question we put to Russell Jones, the chief 
economist for the Layman Brothers in Japan. I think a very aggressive 
policy of deregulation for the domestic economy, some 40 percent of 
the Japanese economy is subject to formal regulation and considerably 
to informal regulation. I think these are areas where there has to 
be change. Getting the banking sector up on its feet is also important, 
but I think the conclusion I reach is that there is no simple solution, 
there is no panacea for Japan. I think irrespective of the direction 
of policy, this is an economy which will have to suffer a protracted 
adjustment phase even if they get policy right, which they're manifestly 
not doing at the moment. It will take time to turn things around. 
Economist Jones says the latest package contain no surprises. The 
markets had little reaction. However some investors did take a pessimistic 
view believing the economy will remain in recession for quite some 
time. It's that kind of attitude that sent the benchmark Nikkei Index 
down 353 points to a close of 14,075.
