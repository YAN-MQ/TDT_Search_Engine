Larry Dirker of Major League Baseball's Houston Astros has been named 
the National League Manager of the Year. Dirker, who came out of the 
broadcast booth two years ago to guide the Astros to two consecutive 
NL central division titles received the award Wednesday from the Baseball 
Writers Association of America. He had helped broadcast the team's 
games for the previous 17 seasons. The Astros manager, who led his 
team to a franchise record 102 wins this season, was named on all 
32 ballots submitted by a pair of writers from each National League 
city. Dirker was named on first 16 ballots and accumulated 102 points 
for a comfortable victory, a margin over second place finisher, Bruce 
Boeshy of the San Diego Padres. Boeshy had five first place votes 
and 70 points. Chicago Cubs manager, Jim Rigelman, finished third 
in the voting with 55 points.
