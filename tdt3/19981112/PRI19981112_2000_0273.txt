The director of the Secret Service, Lou Merletti* says he is retiring 
at the end of the year to head up security for the new Cleveland Browns 
football team. Lee Garnett* of member station WCPN reports. Merletti, 
a 25-year veteran of the Secret Service has headed the agency since 
June of last year. He says President Clinton was disappointed when 
he told him of his pending retirement, but that the president was 
excited when he learned of Merletti's new job. This is truly another 
once in a lifetime opportunity. I could not pass this up. Merletti 
declined to answer questions about the president's possible impeachment 
or whether it had any impact in his decision to leave the Service. 
He had argued unsuccessfully against his Secret Service agents testifying 
before grand juries looking into the president's relationship with 
Monica Lewinski, fearing it would interfere with presidential security.
