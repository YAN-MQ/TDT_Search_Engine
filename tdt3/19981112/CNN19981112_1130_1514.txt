This year's newest action figures don't come with a Kung Fu grip or 
high-tech weaponry. Jeanne Moos reports, these heroes flex their muscles 
in the political arena. Identify this doll. Is it "A," James Earl 
Jones, "B," Tommy Lee Jones, "C," general Colin powell? It's an action 
figure, not a doll. Yes, sir, whatever you say, sir. There's been 
a lot of action lately when it comes to action figures. Take Jesse 
"the body" Ventura -- the plastic body. I can't do it without you. 
Who knows if Jesse would have become governor of Minnesota if his 
action figure hadn't figured into political ads? You can make Jesse 
battle special interest groups. I don't want your stupid money! Neither 
does Colin Powell. Welcome to the Gi Joe team. He's giving all his 
proceeds from his new action figure to the boys and girls club of 
America, though some boys and girls didn't recognize the general, 
despite the helpful name tag. It says there, "podell"? And it wasn't 
just kids who guessed wrong. It's one of the presidents, isn't it? 
Oh, MacArthur? Who's it supposed to be, Colin Powell? This is the 
one that didn't want to be president, right? Right, he opted for the 
doll house rather than the White House. But even a doll has critics. 
Well, for one thing, he's not black enough. I mean, that's the most 
obvious problem. It looks scary. Look at it. I look kind of Stern, 
huh? I look like a general. And this looks like an astronaut. Oh, 
this is Glenn John. Is that his name? John Glenn. John Glenn. I'm 
dyslexic. John Glenn, Glenn John -- who can tell in the helmet? You 
get the young Glenn in his silver spacesuit with space capsule and 
the old Glenn in his orange spacesuit with shuttle, not to mention 
senator glenn in a business suit. But even magnification doesn't help 
identification. Might as well be the guy from "mission: impossible." 
Look -- look at the size, size of his foot. What do you expect for 
$4.99? Colin Powell is $49.99. neither guy is making a penny. And 
get this -- both of these American heroes are made in China. But at 
least the medals on general Powell's chest are accurate. Who knows 
what he'll be wearing once kids get their hands on him? Don't ask, 
don't tell. Yeah, I put on some baggy jeans with a T-shirt. A pair 
of khakis and a nice Polo shirt. So what if John Glenn is so small 
you could choke on him, so small general Powell can clutch him just 
like king Kong clutched Fay wray. You know the old cliche -- take 
it from America's Elder spaceman. Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
