They are still recovering from a massive storm we told you about last 
night in the American midwest that plank thed much of the region with 
heavy snow yesterday, almost whiteout conditions shut out 600 miles 
of highway in minnesota, parts of South Dakota, and elsewhere. Snow 
came in on top of heavy winds. In Colombia, Missouri, wind gusts up 
to 80 miles an hour destroyed 20 homes. That's flat wind, not tornadoes. 
But in Memphis, Tennessee, there was a confirmed tornado. So far, 
the death toll from this one storm, said to be the sixth worst midwest 
storm on record, stands at seven people dead.
