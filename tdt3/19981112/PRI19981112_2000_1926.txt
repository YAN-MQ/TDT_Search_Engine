The U.S. has signed a Kioto* international protocol to fight global 
warming. The last major industrial country to do so. The Undersecretary 
of State, Stewart Eisenstat* is at the United Nations Climate Conference 
in Argentina. We think that this adds more momentum to the process. 
So even though this is not a legally binding step, only the Senate 
can do it, it demonstrates our recommitment to this process. Analysts, 
however, are describing the move as largely symbolic. They say ratification 
by the Senate could take at least two years. The announcement comes 
as the Climate Conference is drawing to a close with little agreement 
on the main issues.
