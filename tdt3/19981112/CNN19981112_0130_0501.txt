I'm meteorologist rose stabler in the CNN weather center with your 
"CNN Headline News" forecast. Thursday morning, expect snow over the 
central and southern Rockies and a Pacific storm system to move into 
the pacific northwest bringing snow and rain. Pretty good bit of sunshine 
across the country with some clouds around frontal boundaries. The 
big weather story Thursday night into Friday morning, heavy rain over 
the south central plains and into the gulf coast region along an area 
of low pressure and a warm front. High temperatures on Thursday, warming 
up quite nicely after a chilly night. However, 20s and 30s in the 
north central U.S. and 30s for highs in the central Rockies. Your 
extended forecast showing windy conditions over the southwest, rain 
and thunderstorms. The rain in the northwest. The thunderstorms over 
the gulf coast with highs only in the 30s for New England and the 
northern plains. On Saturday, a rain and snow mix over the Great Lakes 
with showers and thunderstorms in the east. Showers also over the 
northwest. And then on Sunday, that rain/snow mix moves into New England. 
The showers continue in the northwest. And remember, you can get your 
four-day forecasts for more than 7,200 cities at CNN.com.
