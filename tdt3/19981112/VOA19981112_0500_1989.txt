Israel's Cabinet on Wednesday approved the new peace accord with Palestinians 
calling for withdrawal from 13 percent more of the West Bank. But 
the Israeli leadership also attached conditions to the deal, and the 
Palestinians reject those claiming they violate the accord. Israel 
is demanding a Palestinian vote to formally reject anti-Israeli language 
in the PLO charter. Israel is also threatening to annex huge chunks 
of the West Bank if Palestinians declare an independent state next 
May. But only one day after that vote, seeming to affirm the peace 
process, another action from Israeli government agencies seems bound 
to inflame the bitter dispute about expansion of Israeli settlements. 
The Israeli land authority and the housing ministry have published 
an ad seeking bids in the construction of Hahoma, an area the Palestinians 
call Jebu Abuganin. Palestinians oppose any new Jewish construction 
in the West Bank in East Jerusalem which they view as the capital 
of a future Palestinian state.
