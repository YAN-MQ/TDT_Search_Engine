After a recount of ballots here in Washoe County this week, Nevada 
officials announced Thursday that the latest tally showed that the 
incumbent Democratic U.S. senator, Harry Reid, had defeated his Republican 
challenger, Rep. John Ensign, by 401 votes, or less than 0.1 percent 
of the total 435,787 votes cast in the Nov. 3 election. The delay 
was caused by computer malfunctions and a hand recount of 5,942 misprinted 
ballots in the county. Statewide, Reid held a 459-vote lead when results 
were first announced last week. Ensign's local campaign manager, former 
Gov. Robert List, said he would advise his candidate to seek a statewide 
recount. The latest vote count _ 208,621 for Reid and 208,220 for 
Ensign _ will go to the Nevada state Supreme Court for certification 
Nov. 25. According to the recount, Ensign defeated Reid by 2,162 votes 
out of 96,123 votes cast in Washoe County. Ensign has until Dec. 2 
to to request a statewide recount.
