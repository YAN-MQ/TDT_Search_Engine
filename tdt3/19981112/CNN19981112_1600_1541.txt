In the past, getting an MBA was an express ticket to money and prestige. 
But with today's capricious global economy, that's changing even at 
some of the world's best business schools. Bill Delaney reports. Amid 
so much economic uncertainty, it's not that easy to work up all that 
much worry about the problems of students at Harvard business school. 
Or its neighbor in Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT's sloan school of 
management. Still, even at these prestigious institutions of higher 
earning, a bit of yearning for the good old days of about a year ago. 
It's gotten a lot tighter and a lot worse. It's a lot more competitive. 
When we started business school, I mean, it was easy for graduates 
to get jobs. I mean, there was just, you know -- I mean, basically, 
they had control of the market, and now that's starting to change 
as more and more companies are laying off. In investment banking especially, 
students say. Some who interviewed last summer still haven't heard 
if they're hired. Not that MBAs here at MIT are likely to be altogether 
unemployed, only that students who, even a year ago, could have expected 
as many as a dozen job offers may now have to settle for as a few 
as one or two. And some predict the lowest starting salaries on Wall 
Street since 1994. Harvard business school professor Bruce Scott sees 
a slowdown, no breakdown. They're gonna be graduating into a very 
different climate. There's gonna be, maybe, less in Wall Street. There's 
gonna be, maybe, a little less zing in everything. But I don't think 
we'll have a disaster. I don't -- no matter what happens, I don't 
think it could happen that fast. Some students, from a generation 
that's known few bad times, even accentuate the positive. It really 
makes you think, "what do I really want to do?" Because you can only 
spend so much time recruiting, and now with, you know, the job market 
tightening, people are focusing a lot more, I think. For a business 
student, adversity always brings about more creativity. With the world's 
economy wobbly, the supply of new ideas from the new generation may 
now be in greater demand than ever. Bill Delaney, CNN, Cambridge, 
Massachusetts.
