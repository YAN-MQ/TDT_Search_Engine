Ellis Burks decided to stay with the San Francisco Giants, agreeing 
on Thursday to a dlrs 10 million, two-year contract. Burks, a 34-year-old 
outfielder, was acquired by San Francisco from Colorado on July 31 
for Darryl Hamilton. Coming off a dlrs 9.1 million, two-year contract, 
Burks gets dlrs 4.5 million next season and dlrs 5.5 million in 2000. 
``Today's signing of Ellis Burks has significantly improved our run-producing 
capabilities,'' Giants general manager Brian Sabean said. ``As we 
all witnessed late last season, Ellis really changes the look of our 
lineup.'' The two-time All-Star hit .292 with 21 homers and 76 RBIs 
this season. With the Giants, he batted .306 with five homers and 
22 RBIs. Burks played with injured knees this year and had surgery 
after the season _ Sept. 30 on his left knee and Oct. 28 on his right. 
``We can expect him to play even a more prominent role for us, both 
at the plate and in the field,'' Sabean said. Burks, with a .290 career 
average, 230 homers and 820 RBIs, was the second free agent to re-sign 
with the Giants. Pitcher Mark Gardner agreed to a dlrs 5 million, 
two-year deal. Hamilton agreed last week to a dlrs 10.5 million, three-year 
contract with the Rockies.
