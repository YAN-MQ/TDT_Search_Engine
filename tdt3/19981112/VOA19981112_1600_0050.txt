I'm Carol Castial, VOA News. President Clinton is telephoning world 
leaders as he continues his effort to build support for the use of 
force if necessary to get Iraq to resume U.N. weapons inspections. 
Correspondent David Gullis reports from the White House. Mr. Clinton 
has made no new public comments on the crisis but he is heavily involved 
behind the scenes. Officials here say he has telephoned the leaders 
of several West European countries and will have another meeting with 
his national security team on the situation later in the day. White 
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States still wants a 
peaceful end to the confrontation and has not set a deadline for military 
action against Iraq. He also welcomed a statement by the Gulf Cooperation 
Council member states along with Egypt and Syria that Saddam Hussein 
would be responsible for a deterioration in the situation saying that 
underscores the Iraqi leader's international isolation. Ministers 
from the Arab countries who met in Gutter urged a diplomatic resolution 
of the crisis, though Spokesman Lockhart said here, the time for negotiations 
on Iraq's defiance of the U.N. is over. David Gullis, VOA News, the 
White House. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has no plans 
to go to Iraq to try to mediate the latest crisis. The U.N. chief 
will discuss the Iraq situation with the Security Council on Friday, 
but a spokesman says he sees no other role for himself at this time.
