Forget the fascination with our semiannual military buildup in the 
Persian Gulf to persuade Saddam Hussein ``this time we're really, 
really serious.'' That point's been made with the U.N.'s evacuation 
of employees it does not want to be chained to suspected anthrax storage 
sites. Focus instead on the strategy of both sides. The Clinton strategy 
up to now has been to go along with U.N. appeasement of Saddam to 
such an extent that even the French got sick of sustained humiliation. 
Our doormat approach _ though it has enabled Iraq secretly to steal 
a march on building terror weapons _ is now being presented as having 
brilliantly ``unified our allies.'' Having been dared by Saddam to 
launch air strikes, President Clinton has four strategic options: 
One is to do nothing, become the world laughingstock, and watch the 
United Nations go the way of the impotent League of Nations. Another 
is to remove Saddam's threat by a second invasion, this time setting 
up a democratic government in Iraq as we did in 1945 in Germany and 
Japan. Neither of these options is being considered by this White 
House. Instead, we have strategic choice No. 3: ``300 pinpricks'' 
to exhibit our extreme irritation. Cruise missiles launched from sea 
for a couple of weeks, accompanied by film showing the uncanny smartness 
of our munitions, would be followed by our unilateral declaration 
of ``mission accomplished'' and a promise to annoy Iraq again next 
year. The fourth choice is the ``degrade his capabilities'' option, 
which seems to be in favor: Use cruise missiles at first to disrupt 
communications and depress air defenses, then strike with carrier 
aircraft and heavy bombers from land bases. This would target suspected 
weapons manufacturing sites, tank parking lots and army barracks, 
similar to our softening-up air campaign of a decade ago. The Clinton 
joint chiefs would claim we successfully ``degraded'' his threat. 
That military jargon means ``temporarily lessened'' but by no means 
``ended.'' We would again wait for an internal revolt to topple him 
(as we have been for Fidel Castro for 40 years). If it doesn't work 
out, that's the next U.S. president's problem, though Saddam may then 
be in a position to reach for his ultimate strategic goal. What is 
that goal? And could the incipient aerial punishment help Saddam achieve 
it? First, it is to endure and survive. Because the U.S. mission is 
limited to punishing but not ending his regime, Saddam is convinced 
he can absorb the heaviest air attacks with personal impunity. Nor 
is the United States. likely to knock out all his hidden germ, gas 
and nuclear weapons potential. Second, counterattack with his people's 
suffering. He will invite television crews to cover collateral damage 
to civilians. If necessary, he can set off bombs in children's hospitals 
and orphanages himself. Filmed atrocity will not only afflict the 
Americans with self-disgust but bring about an alliance with Iran, 
which will soon be able to swap its long-range missiles for his warheads. 
Finally, make a deal with the U.N. for limited access by non-American 
inspectors. Clinton _ branded ``baby killer'' by Iraqi propagandists 
_ is unlikely to resist, especially if our bombers or helicopters 
crash or terrorists take allied lives. This will enable Saddam's weapons 
development to go forward in secrecy while sanctions are lifted. Within 
two years, Iraqi oil production will finance purchase of fissionable 
material and missiles. Although Saddam miscalculated wildly a decade 
ago, his current strategy takes full advantage of Clinton's expected 
decision to wage limited air war with its modest compliance aim. So 
long as our purpose is only to ``degrade'' facilities rather than 
to replace an aggressive regime, the strategic advantage is his. His 
ultimate purpose is to be able to credibly bluff the West into letting 
him dominate his part of the world. In 2002, he moves on Saudi Arabia; 
we threaten to invade Iraq; Saddam announces he is ready to risk national 
suicide by firing a nuclear missile at us. The United States has no 
missile defense. Does a prudent president let him grab those oilfields, 
or will Clinton's successor be forced to gamble a U.S. city on the 
hope that a homicidal maniac is only bluffing?
