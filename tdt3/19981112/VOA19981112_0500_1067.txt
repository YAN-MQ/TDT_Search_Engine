Correspondent Mike Bowman in Tegucigalpa, Honduras speaking with VOA's 
Ray Kouguell. And from Washington, this is VOA News Now. I'm Charlene 
Porter, along with Les Carpenter. We are at 10 hours, 18 universal 
time. And the major news story we're following now with diplomacy 
seemingly at an end, the standoff between Iraq and United Nations 
seems to have increased the chance of U.S. military action against 
Baghdad. Further details later in the broadcast. It's time now for 
sports, and here's our favorite sport, Jim Stevenson.
