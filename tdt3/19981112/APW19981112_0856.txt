Conservative President Jacques Chirac and Socialist Prime Minister 
Lionel Jospin, while not always on the same wavelength, are sharing 
one thing: plummeting popularity rates. Two opinion polls published 
Thursday show both Chirac and Jospin are continuing to suffer from 
high unemployment, student discontent and sporadic strikes. Jospin, 
whose ratings have at times topped 70 percent since he took office 
in June last year, got a 63 percent approval rating, down 11 points, 
according to a Louis Harris poll. Chirac got a 60 percent rating in 
the same poll, also down 11 points from last month. Another survey, 
conducted by the IPSOS agency for Le Point magazine, showed Chirac 
getting a 63 percent rating, down three points and Jospin sliding 
five points to a 60 percent approval rating. Both leaders had profited 
from France's summer World Cup soccer victory and from economic growth. 
But the French stock market has suffered from the world financial 
crisis and unemployment, while down slightly, remains at a hefty 11.7 
percent. Both polls were conducted Nov. 6-7, surveying a nationally 
representative sampling of 1,004 adults for the Louis Harris poll 
and 940 adults in the IPSOS sampling. No margins of error were given, 
but such French polls usually carry an error margin of plus or minus 
2-3 percent.
