In California, the lumber company at the center of a controversy over 
an ancient Redwood forest lost its license to cut trees. Anti-logging 
activists have waged a bitter fight for a long time against this company. 
The battle ground is humble county in northern California. ABC's Brian 
Rooney is there tonight. For the past 11 months, a young woman has 
been living at the top of one of pacific lumber's Redwood trees, protesting 
just the kind of environmental damage cited in the state's complaint. 
But ultimately this is only one step in the right direction. It took 
300 violations for the department of forestry to finally enforce the 
law. Environmentalists have long claimed that pacific lumber consistently 
breaks the rules to cut more and more trees. Now the California department 
of lumber forestry has accused pacific lumber of damaging salmon-spawning 
streams and logging too close to areas protected for the spotted owl. 
The agency described pacific's behavior as "Gross negligence and willful 
disregard" for the rules. Following the state's action, pacific lumber 
laid off 180 employees who cut and ship trees to the mill. The company 
president admitted making mistakes. We try to be perfect. We're not 
perfect. But we've striving to do so. The action by the state could 
endanger a pending deal to protect 7,500 acres of pristine forest 
known as the headwaters. Under the terms of the agreement, pacific 
lumber would sell the forest to the government but still be allowed 
to log 500 acres of old growth. The whole deal could collapse if the 
state and federal governments decide pacific lumber can't be trusted 
to log by the rules. Environmentalists say pacific lumber has a history 
of doing damage. It's a mudslide that was caused by the cutting, caused 
by the timber harvesting up here. Suspension of pacific lumber's license 
hurts the company's reputation but is more of a blow to its workers 
than the company itself. Pacific lumber still owns the trees and can 
hire licensed contractors to continue cutting. Brian Rooney, ABC News, 
Scotia, California.
