Here's the good part about ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'': It's short. 
Here's the dangerous part: If you've never had the urge to kick Santa 
Claus, this might be just the irksome misadventure into comedy that 
will drive you over the edge. That's because Santa comes in the form 
of a smug, smarmy collegian named Jake. As written by Harris Goldberg 
and Tom Nursall and directed by Arlene Sanford, ``I'll Be Home for 
Christmas'' asks of its audience something even more difficult than 
believing in Old Saint Nick or the Easter Bunny: It asks the audience 
to believe that Jake, an obnoxious twit played by Jonathan Taylor 
Thomas of ``Home Improvement,'' undergoes some sort of metamorphosis 
as he makes his way cross-country from California to his home in Larchmont, 
N.Y., at Christmas break while glued inside a Santa suit. Those who 
saute their brains for five minutes in the butter machine before entering 
the theater may achieve sufficient softening to accomplish this feat, 
but others may find it more difficult. Why has Jake been glued inside 
a Santa suit and left in the California desert? One of Jake's sidelines 
is arranging for jocks to cheat on their exams by providing them with 
pagers that can receive the answers, but his nemesis, Eddie (Adam 
LaVorgna), foils the scheme, and Jake is punished. Although less serious 
than disruption of the Middle East oil supply, this setback has repercussions: 
(1) Jake may not make it home to Westchester by 6 p.m. on Christmas 
Eve, the deadline for his father's bribe, a classic red Porsche. Hamlet-like, 
Jake has been avoiding home because he thinks Dad married in unseemly 
haste after Mom's death. (2) Jake's girlfriend, Allie (Jessica Biel), 
a young woman tolerant of Jake to the point of idiocy, has to accept 
a ride from college to Larchmont with Eddie. The egocentric Jake lies, 
cheats, steals, and gives and accepts bribes. Eddie, who frequently 
refers to himself in the third person, as in Ed Man, is like Jake, 
only dumber. Superficial and defined mainly by their hair, teeth and 
smiles, Jake, Eddie and Allie are not exactly the most engaging companions 
for a cross-country journey. On the way, while their paths cross occasionally, 
Jake hitches a ride with some old ladies bound for a Tom Jones performance 
in Las Vegas; rides in a van loaded with stolen goods, which he eventually 
distributes in a children's ward; encounters a lovelorn state trooper, 
and reconciles him with his wife at a steak restaurant called Turf 
&AMP; Turf; runs a five-kilometer race with other Santa Clauses, and 
returns the $1,000 prize so it can be used to feed the needy, and 
bursts in on Eddie and Allie in the honeymoon suite of a Bavarian-theme 
hotel. Although the spirits behind ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' 
treat the audience to vomit in the back of the old ladies' car and 
a flatulent dog, they make nothing of the comic possibilities of the 
lederhosen crowd. Mel Brooks, where are you when we need you? ``I'll 
Be Home for Christmas'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). 
It contains some mildly vulgar language. PRODUCTION NOTES: `I'LL BE
