The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 13: A presidential 
task force of apparel makers, human rights groups and consumer advocates 
recently agreed on how to put in place a voluntary code of conduct 
for domestic and overseas factories. Although not perfect, the accord 
should improve sweatshop conditions and give American consumers information 
so that they can choose not to buy goods produced in inhumane conditions. 
The plan creates a new nonprofit Fair Labor Association of business, 
labor and human rights representatives. The association would enforce 
the code and oversee independent monitors who would inspect factories 
for compliance. Only companies that meet the standards would be allowed 
to use the association's seal on their goods. The point is to give 
companies a marketing advantage if they comply with the code. Under 
the code, factories could not use forced labor nor require employees 
to work more than 60 hours a week. Apparel makers could not employ 
children under the age of 15, unless the country's laws allow 14-year-olds 
to work, and they would have to pay the minimum wage or prevailing 
industry wage where the factories are located. Companies would have 
to consult with local labor and human rights groups about workplace 
standards. American labor unions initially agreed to the principles 
but have rejected the implementation plan because it does not require 
that businesses pay a ``living wage.'' They also want more frequent 
monitoring of factories, and object to allowing companies to operate 
in countries such as China that restrict unions. Their concerns are 
legitimate, but the current agreement is a good first step. Compliance 
with the code of conduct does not mean that the shoes or shirts consumers 
buy are the product of ideal or even fair labor conditions. But compliance 
would indicate that the manufacturer abides by rules that give workers 
some protection from the most exploitative practices.
