China has angrily criticized the United States for sending a Cabinet 
secretary to Taiwan and for President Clinton's White House meeting 
with the Dalai Lama. The Chinese foreign ministry condemned both meetings 
as a violation of American agreements and demanded that Washington 
correct its mistakes. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson met with 
Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui in Taipei on Tuesday as Mr. Clinton 
was meeting in Washington with the Tibetan spiritual leader.
