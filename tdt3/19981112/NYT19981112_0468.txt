Anita Kurman Gulkin, president and chief executive of Greenwich House 
Inc., a social-service and cultural community organization based in 
Greenwich Village, died Nov. 8 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. 
She was 59, lived in Springfield, N.J., and also had an apartment 
in Manhattan. The cause was a heart attack during hip surgery last 
Friday, and she also had cancer, said Paul Racioppi, Greenwich House's 
chief development officer. She went to work as usual the day before 
the surgery. Ms. Gulkin, a former specialist in programs for drug 
abusers, became Greenwich House's executive director in 1976. Her 
title was changed to president and chief executive in 1991. The multifaceted 
organization has its headquarters at 27 Barrow St., employs 250 people 
and also carries on its programs at seven other sites in and near 
Greenwich Village. In her 22 years as its senior salaried executive, 
its annual operating budget grew to $13.5 million from $1 million 
or less, Racioppi said. In the years since 1986, Ms. Gulkin set into 
motion new Greenwich House programs for recovering alcoholics, other 
substance abusers and people with HIV or AIDS, as well as for providing 
music and fine-arts classes in public elementary schools, for treating 
abused children and preventing child abuse and for serving hot meals 
for elderly Greenwich Villagers to eat together. She joined Greenwich 
House's staff as a supervisor of its programs for drug abusers in 
1968 and was made director of its substance abuse clinics in 1972. 
Over the years, she was also active in other Manhattan social-service 
organizations. At her death, she was chairwoman of Caring Community, 
which administers programs for the elderly, mainly in Greenwich Village, 
and the West Side Association of Community Centers. She was also a 
co-founder and a former member of the board of what is now called 
Urban Pathways. She was inducted into Greenwich Village's Hall of 
Fame and received the United Way's Big Apple Award. A native of Newark, 
N.J., she received a bachelor's degree from Pennsylvania State University 
and later studied social work at Columbia. She is survived by her 
husband, Sam Gulkin; a brother, Dr. Martin Kurman of Manhattan, and 
a sister, Bernice Winarsky of Springfield.
