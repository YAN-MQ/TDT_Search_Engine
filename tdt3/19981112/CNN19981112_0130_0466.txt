The midwest's first winter storm is subsiding but power crews are 
trying to restore electricity for more than 1 million people in several 
states. Wind gusts of 93 miles an hour were reported in parts of Wisconsin. 
Meteorologists say the blizzard was one of the most powerful ever 
to hit the midwest and the strongest low-pressure system in 25-years. 
It brought more than a foot of snow to some places and is being blamed 
for at least seven deaths.
