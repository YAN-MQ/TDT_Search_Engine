A republican lawmaker says the Justice and Defense Departments were 
negligent in the shooting death of a Texas teenager who was killed 
by Marines last year. NPR's Brian Naler* reports. Texas republican, 
Lamar Smith, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Immigration released 
a 249-page report on the death of 18 year-old, Isiquial Hernandez*. 
The tenth-grader was tending his family's goatherd along the banks 
of the Rio Grande River in May of 1997, when a Marine Corp unit on 
a border anti-drug patrol gunned him down. The boy was carrying a 
rifle, which the Marine said he shot in their direction. Smith, however, 
said the Marines should have been better trained. For example, the 
Marines were not told that innocent civilians in this part of the 
country often carry weapons and are weary of intruders. They were 
not made to understand how threatening they might appear to local 
residents with no knowledge of their presence. Smith also criticized 
the Justice Department for obstructing investigations into the incident. 
Two grand juries failed to issue any indictments in the shooting.
