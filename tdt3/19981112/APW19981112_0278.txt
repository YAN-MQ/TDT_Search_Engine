A firing squad in Taiwan has executed a Filipino worker convicted 
of multiple murder and robbery despite an appeal by the Philippines 
to defer the execution, officials said Thursday. Jonathan Burgos was 
executed last week after Taiwan's Supreme Court affirmed his death 
sentence on Oct. 29, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said in a report 
to Philippine President Joseph Estrada. A Taiwanese district court 
sentenced Burgos to death in January last year for murdering a Taiwanese 
woman and her two children, then robbing them of 700,000 Taiwan dollars 
(U.S. dlrs 21,400), Siazon said. The Philippines' de facto embassy 
in Taipei made a strong appeal to Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to 
defer the execution and commute Burgos' sentence to life in prison. 
The mission provided Burgos with a lawyer and sought the help of the 
Vatican, which has diplomatic ties with Taiwan, to lobby for the execution's 
deferment. Manila's foreign office also helped Burgos' wife to travel 
to visit him in jail early this year. The Philippines has diplomatic 
relations with Beijing, but maintains strong unofficial ties with 
Taipei. Instead of embassies, Taiwan and the Philippines maintain 
economic and cultural offices, which are de facto consular offices.
