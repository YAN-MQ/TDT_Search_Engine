The death toll in floods in western Ukraine has risen to 11, and bad 
weather is hampering efforts to quickly repair the damages, officials 
said Thursday. A total of 230 people have been hospitalized, but doctors 
said many more of the 300,000 people affected by the disaster are 
in danger of catching infections because a third of the drinking water 
supply in the Zakarpattia region has been polluted by the floods. 
Heavy rains inundated at least 118 towns and villages in Zakarpattia 
last week, but repairs have been difficult because of fresh downpours 
in the last few days. The flooded area is just across Ukraine's western 
border from Slovakia and Hungary. More than 9,500 emergency workers 
were sent to the region, where about 21,500 houses have been flooded 
and hundreds of buildings destroyed together with bridges, dams, roads 
and railways, the Emergencies Ministry said. The Ukrainian government 
has appealed to the United Nations, the European Union and individual 
countries for help. Hungary, Slovenia and Kazakstan have already promised 
aid, according to Cabinet officials. Ukraine's government has allocated 
10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9 million) for the relief effort following 
orders from President Leonid Kuchma, who visited the region last week. 
No official estimates of the losses incurred by the floods have been 
provided so far. Rains in Zakarpattia are expected to continue for 
several days, the Ukrainian Meteorological Center said.
