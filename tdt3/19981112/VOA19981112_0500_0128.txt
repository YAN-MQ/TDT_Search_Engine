Israel's Cabinet has approved the new peace accord with the Palestinians 
calling for withdrawal from 13 percent more of the West Bank, but 
it has also attached some conditions rejected by Palestinians. They 
say these violate the accord. Israel is demanding a Palestinian vote 
to formally reject anti-Israeli language in the PLO charter. Israel 
is threatening to annex huge chunks of the West Bank if Palestinians 
declare an independent state next May. Palestinians say they have 
complained to the United States about the new Israeli conditions.
