A national housing group is using state-of-the-art technology to help 
families in tough financial situations. The result eventually could 
be a huge cut in your energy Bill. Deborah feyerick explains. Rylona 
Watson renovates homes for low to medium-income families in urban 
neighborhoods in the United States. But she was running into a problem. 
Although the mortgages were affordable, the heating and electricity 
bills were not. And families were feeling the pinch. My concern became, 
"will they be able to pay their mortgage and not pay the utilities 
and lose the house anyway?" That's when Chris benedict came on board. 
We simply put this up against the ceiling. Benedict is an environmentalist 
and architect. She found heat was gushing from the homes. So she came 
up with a three-part plan she hopes will become a worldwide model 
to make urban homes more energy-efficient. The design fuses insulation, 
heating and ventilation systems. They have a very simple but very 
sophisticated relationship to each other. And bringing those pieces 
into harmony is really what energy efficient building and green building 
is about. And they brought in a hose and they blew the insulation 
into the wall. Benedict says the walls are airtight, vacuum-packed 
with recycled newspapers and fireproof material. Heat stays in, she 
says, moisture and mold stay out. What's more, each room has its own 
thermostat gauge and these special window devices, so the rooms never 
get too hot or too cold. A special boiler, the size of those used 
to heat a single-family home, in this building heats four apartments. 
So far, 18 of these homes in New York have been renovated. And while 
using this green plan costs a little more, about 1% extra, planners 
believe building expenses will ultimately go down once contractors 
become familiar with the design. As for heating costs, owners could 
end up saving as much as 50%. Deborah feyerick, for CNN, New York.
