The Spanish government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and the 
armed Basque separatist group ETA have made direct contact for the 
first time, an initial step toward new peace talks, a newspaper reported 
Thursday. The move followed Aznar's authorization last week of contacts 
with ETA, the daily El Mundo reported, quoting unnamed government 
sources. Francisco Martos, a spokesman for Aznar's office contacted 
by The Associated Press, refused to comment on the report. He said 
that although Aznar has promised to inform the public of all developments 
related to the Basque peace process, the delicacy of the issue requires 
that the details be treated with discretion. El Mundo said the first 
direct contacts between this government and ETA were limited to a 
recognition that there would be more contact in the future. The latest 
possibility of a negotiated end to ETA's 30-year-long violent campaign 
for an independent Basque homeland straddling the Spanish-French border 
dates to Sept. 18 when ETA began observing an indefinite cease-fire. 
The government gradually softened its position on the truce, with 
the initial suspicion developing into a promise of dialogue. Although 
willing to talk, the government insists that the agenda will not include 
political issues such as ETA's stated aim of Basque independence. 
The government says it is willing to talk about the fate of ETA's 
535 prisoners in return for a clear commitment to give up violence 
forever and respect existing democratic procedures. ETA--the initials 
in the Basque language stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom--has 
killed nearly 800 people since taking up arms in 1968. The government 
last held talks with ETA in 1989 in Algeria when Felipe Gonzalez's 
Socialist party was in office. The talks broke down and the violence 
resumed.
