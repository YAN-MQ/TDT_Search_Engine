For the second time in five months, India on Thursday tested a sea-skimming 
missile that can deliver conventional explosives up to a range of 
nine kilometers (5.5 miles), domestic news agencies said. The Indian-made 
Trishul missile was fired from a naval base in the southwestern city 
of Cochin, Press Trust of India news agency reported. ``Analysis of 
the test firing was very encouraging,'' the news agency quoted project 
director A.J. Kapoor as saying. The 650-kilo (1,444-pound) missile 
can also be used as a surface-to-air missile with a range of 25 kilometers 
(15 miles). The government plans to make Trishul, or Trident, part 
of the navy armory by the end of the decade. The naval version uses 
solid fuel, has a range of up to nine kilometers (5.5 miles), and 
can carry a warhead of 15 kilos (33 pounds). This sea-skimming version 
was first tested in June, and two more tests are planned in the next 
few days, United News of India news agency reported. ``The current 
tests prove that the missile is among the best ... of similar types,'' 
said Sivathanu Pillai, chief controller of the Defense Research and 
Development Organization, which developed the missile. The latest 
test came as India and Pakistan resumed talks to reduce tension between 
the two nations, which have fought three wars over the Himalayan territory 
of Kashmir. Little progress has been made in talks held so far. India 
tested five underground nuclear devices in May and is perfecting a 
delivery system. India says it needs a nuclear defense against China 
and Pakistan, both nuclear powers.
