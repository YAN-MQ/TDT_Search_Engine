And the touring North American Major League Baseball All Stars have 
bounced back from consecutive defeats beat their Japanese counterparts 
two to nothing on Thursday. Both runs were scored on sacrifice flies. 
Pitcher Jamie Moyer of the Seattle Mariners allowed only two hits 
and five shut out innings in the game in Osaka. Three relief pitchers 
completed the victory. It was Moyer's second win on the seven-game 
Japanese tour, which the Major Leaguers now lead three games to two. 
The final two games will be played in Tokyo on Saturday and Sunday.
