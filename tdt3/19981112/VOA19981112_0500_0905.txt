With a pretty dire economic situation being faced by Russia's leaders, 
we've got all that done, the international community is increasing 
its support for hurricane ravaged Central America with hundreds of 
millions of dollars of relief on the way. The U.S. has announced another 
1-1/2 million dollars to buy medicine. The total U.S. contribution 
exceeds $70 million. The European Union is sending another $120 million. 
Central America's less wealthy neighbors are also helping out Honduras, 
the hardest hit country. Correspondent Michael Bowman is in Tegucigalpa. 
He described the scene in the Honduran capital to VOA's Ray Kouguell. 
Coming into Tegucigalpa, it was raining and this new rain poses additional 
problems for relief efforts in Honduras. It is the last thing that 
the country needs right now, but there was a steady rainfall Wednesday 
afternoon, and it continued into the evening, and at times, it rained 
quite hard. I also saw people lining up for blocks to get drinking 
water and there is a real concern that there might be a cholera outbreak 
because drinking water is in short supply. People may be tempted to 
drink water that has not been purified, that is not clean. There is 
concern of cholera, there is concern of dysentery. And at the same 
time, as you see all of the destruction and as you see the houses 
that have been damaged, and you see the looks of anguish on the faces 
of people in Honduras, when you talk to them, they also speak of the 
way in which the country has rallied and is trying to come together 
and maintain a sense of pride and a sense of enduring this. And people 
talking about how they will rebuild and people forming volunteer brigades, 
and patrolling the streets. At the same time, there is a security 
concern. There is a curfew in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, at 
p.m. local time until 6:00 in the morning. There has been looting 
because so many houses and so many businesses are damaged. They are 
susceptible to people breaking in and stealing items. And in order 
to crack down on this thievery, authorities have found it necessary 
to impose a nighttime curfew.
