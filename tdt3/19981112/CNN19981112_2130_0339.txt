A bullet fired at a federal command post in North Carolina last night 
may have been an accident, but authorities are investigating the incident 
as if it were deliberate. The bullet apparently came from a nearby 
field used by deer hunters. It grazed the hair of an agent, but did 
not wound him. The agents are searching for Eric Rudolph, who is wanted 
in the bombing of an Alabama women's clinic and three bombings in 
Atlanta, including the one at centennial Olympic park in 1996.
