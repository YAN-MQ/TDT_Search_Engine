Now to current problems, you and your health insurance and the rude 
awakening that many Americans are getting these days when their bills 
come due. Many insurers are now raising premiums for people who buy 
individual policies -- raising them by 100% or more. What can you 
do if this happens to you? Here's NBC's Lisa Myers. Marion Barber 
is a healthy 63-year-old. So she was stunned by the notice from her 
insurance company. I was totally shocked. I was very angry. I mean, 
I just thought it was unconscionable. Unconscionable, she says, because 
her health insurance premium almost doubled. And if you think that's 
bad, Anne and Tom Sullivan saw theirs go up a Whopping 124%. I thought, 
really, it had been misprinted and yelled at Tom and said, "Please 
call Kaiser and see if this is not a mistake." But it's no mistake, 
as many of the 16 million Americans with individual health insurance 
policies see their premiums skyrocketing. In California, up as much 
as 58%. New York, as much as 59%. Florida 38%. Hardest hit -- those 
in their 50s and early 60s, too young for Medicare, too old not to 
have insurance. Why are their rates going up so much? Insurance companies 
say it's because medical costs are going up. So you'd think everyone's 
premiums are increasing. Yet, one company, Kaiser permanente, that 
proposed doubling rates for many older people actually cut them for 
those under 50. We have to design our prices in order to continue 
to attract younger people to participate in the plan. The result -- 
even a healthy 60-year-old with no major illnesses can end up paying 
three times more than a healthy 25-year-old for the very same insurance. 
So what can you do if your insurance soars? First, shop around. Not 
all companies are raising rates as much and there may be a better 
plan out there. Second, talk to your current insurance company about 
less expensive options, such as paying a bigger share of medical bills 
yourself to lower your premium. As prices in the individual markets 
go up for people who most need coverage, some of them will struggle 
to hold on, but some of them will be unable to afford it. The sullivans 
will hold on by taking money out of retirement savings. Barber isn't 
as lucky. I'm going to join the ranks of the uninsured. She plans 
to get a physical before she loses coverage, then, like millions of 
other uninsured Americans, will pray she doesn't get sick. Lisa Myers, 
NBC news, Washington.
