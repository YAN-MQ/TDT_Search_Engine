The economic crisis has hurt the Malay community proportionally harder 
than any other ethnic group in Singapore, a newspaper reported Thursday, 
revealing a potential crack in this tightly knit society. The government 
said earlier this week that more than 20,000 workers were laid off 
in the first nine months of this year. A report in The Straits Times 
said 20 percent of those laid off are ethnic Malays, even though they 
form only 11 percent of Singapore's work force. The data provided 
by Mendaki, a government-linked Malay self-help organization, also 
showed that 70 percent of Malay workers have only secondary education 
or below. The government in this affluent island state has launched 
a number of programs to fight the crisis, but their success would 
depend largely on Singapore retaining its multi-ethnic cohesion. About 
78 percent of Singapore's 3.1 million people are of Chinese descent, 
14 percent are ethnic Malays and 7 percent ethnic Indians. Though 
the ruling People's Action Party, in power for 40 years, has prided 
itself on achieving a harmonious multi-racial and multi-religious 
society, differences still exist. Few Singaporeans marry outside their 
ethnic group, and minorities do less well professionally that the 
dominant Chinese group. According to the official survey for 1995, 
Malays account for less than 1.5 percent of Singapore's legislators, 
senior officials and managers, and about 3 percent of all professionals. 
The government has initiated several programs to retrain Malays who 
have lost their jobs, and will even air a television serial on transforming 
low-skilled Malays into more valuable workers. Singapore leaders have 
repeatedly said only highly skilled, educated workers can lead the 
small state out of the crisis. Malays are the main racial group in 
neighboring Malaysia. Singapore and Malaysia were briefly joined in 
a federation in 1963, but went their separate ways two years later 
after ethnically charged riots in Singapore pitted local Malays against 
the Chinese.
