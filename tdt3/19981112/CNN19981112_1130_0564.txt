After watching their currency plunge in value, Russians are now dealing 
with a severe drop in temperatures. Humanitarian aid groups warn that 
the cold coupled with economic turmoil could prove dangerous. Wayne 
Gray reports. Even by harsh Russian standards, this winter promises 
to be a Cold one. The signs are there. Cars not starting, locks freezing 
up. Merchant Oleg yusupov has seen his share of cold winters. We will 
just have to turn to the traditional cure-all -- vodka. But for the 
less fortunate, they will have to warm themselves the best they can. 
Makeshift fires of burning garbage, or even at soup kitchens for the 
homeless. But radio stations already are broadcasting news of victims 
of the cold weather. Two bodies found frozen, the victims of hypothermia. 
Every Russian winter hits the poorer segment of the population hardest. 
But as the temperatures go down, the number of people at risk rises. 
A devalued ruble puts basic commodities like gloves out the reach 
of many people, even those lucky enough to still have jobs. And that's 
putting a strain on traditional forms of aid. All the indicators available 
tell us this winter might be a very difficult winter for people in 
Russia, much worse than last year. And also, that's an indication 
why our appeal this year is much higher than last year. Aid officials 
warn that without a response to that appeal, this winter could prove 
disastrous for many. Wayne Gray, CNN.
