Lawyers for Ira Magaziner on Thursday urged a federal appeals court 
to clear him of a judge's accusation that he lied under oath about 
the work of President Clinton's task force on health care reform. 
In an hourlong hearing before the court, a Justice Department lawyer 
maintained that Magaziner, the chief architect of Clinton's ill-fated 
health care plan, had told the truth and nothing but the truth. ``Mr. 
Magaziner's declaration was not false,'' said the lawyer, Jacob Lewis. 
``There was no need to correct or update it.'' The accusation at issue 
dates from last December, when U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth 
found that the White House and the Justice Department had participated 
in a ``reprehensible'' effort to cover up false statements by Magaziner. 
The judge said he had relied on those statements as an authoritative 
account of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform 
and its inter-agency working group. In his finding of misconduct, 
Lamberth ordered the government to pay $285,864 to cover legal fees 
and other costs of doctors and consumer groups that had filed suit 
to gain access to meetings of the task force and its staff in 1993. 
The Clinton administration challenged that order Thursday in the District 
of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Prosecutors who investigated 
the case at Lamberth's behest concluded in 1995 that there was no 
evidence Magaziner had tried to mislead the court. Magaziner still 
works on the White House staff, as the president's adviser on the 
Internet and electronic commerce, but he plans to leave by the end 
of this year and is now trying redeem his reputation. He wants the 
appeals court to void the lower court's finding that he lied. Irvin 
Nathan, his lawyer, told the appeals court, ``Mr. Magaziner is an 
honorable and honest public servant whose previously impeccable reputation 
has been improperly stained by the District Court's unfounded conclusion 
that he deliberately swore to a false and misleading declaration.'' 
Justice Department lawyers said Lamberth had distorted Magaziner's 
statements and in any event had not relied on them in his original 
rulings. Moreover, they said, Magaziner merely signed statements that 
had been drafted for him by White House lawyers. The case has a tangled 
history. In a sworn declaration in 1993, Magaziner said all members 
of the task force and its staff were government employees _ a statement 
that, if true, might have allowed them to conduct their business in 
secret. In fact, the task force recruited scores of experts from private 
industry to advise the Clinton administration on how to redesign the 
nation's health care system to control costs and guarantee insurance 
for all Americans. Magaziner contends that these people were all regular 
or special government employees, under rather elastic definitions 
of those terms. A 1972 law requires that the meetings of federal advisory 
committees be open and that the committees make their work papers 
available for public inspection. But the law does not apply to committees 
``composed wholly of full-time officers or employees of the federal 
government.'' The administration initially indicated that it would 
use this exception to defend the secrecy of the inter-agency working 
group that sifted options for the president's task force. But it later 
emphasized another argument, telling Lamberth that the president's 
health plan had been devised by ``an anonymous horde'' of more than 
500 people operating in creative confusion with no organized structure 
and no fixed roster of members. Hence, it said, the 1972 law did not 
apply. In papers filed recently with the appeals court, Magaziner 
cited statements made this year on the floor of the House of Representatives 
as evidence of the damage to his reputation. Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., 
said Magaziner had ``lied to the court.'' Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., 
said Magaziner ``chose not to tell the truth.'' Rep. Bill Archer, 
R-Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said 
Clinton should have dismissed Magaziner and should not require taxpayers 
to foot the bill for the $285,864 sanction. Thomas Spencer, a lawyer 
for the plaintiffs, including the Association of American Physicians 
and Surgeons, told the appeals court Thursday that the reprimand of 
Magaziner was appropriate because he had engaged in ``outrageous conduct.''
