The State Department said today that Israel could harm the Middle 
East peace process by going ahead with plans to build a large Jewish 
housing complex in East Jerusalem. The housing complex is to be built 
on land that Palestinians want to make part of the capital of their 
proposed independent state. Palestinian leaders reacted angrily to 
the Israeli decision saying it violates the latest peace agreement. 
They also denounced the conditions that Israeli Prime Minister; Benjamin 
Netanyahu attached in the accord before it was ratified yesterday 
by Israel's cabinet. The conditions included demand that the Israeli 
cabinet approve of each phase of the Israeli withdrawal.
