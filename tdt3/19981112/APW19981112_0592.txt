The British Red Cross on Thursday presented a special community award 
to the people of Omagh, site of the worst terrorist strike in Northern 
Ireland's 30-year conflict. A car bomb planted by Irish Republican 
Army dissidents Aug. 15 killed 29 people and injured about 330 people 
in the town. ``The timing of this is very important as it comes three 
months after the event, when we thought the rest of the world had 
forgotten,'' said David Bolton of Omagh's Health and Personal Social 
Services Trust, one of several representatives accepting the award. 
``It is an encouragement to the people of Omagh,'' Bolton said. In 
presenting the award, British television personality Claire Rayner 
said Omagh residents ``showed what friends, relatives and next-door 
neighbors can do when they join together when faced with such a terrible 
situation. They are an example to all communities.''
