The United Nations' World Food Program says it has made massive increases 
in its delivery of food to Central America. It is responding to the 
devastation left by Hurricane Mitch. Officials say more than 100,000 
tons of food will be delivered to Central America over the next six 
months. Most of the food will go to women and children in rural communities 
where many crops have been wiped out.
