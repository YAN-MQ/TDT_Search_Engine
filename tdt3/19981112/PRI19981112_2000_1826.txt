For The World, I am Derek Stoffle in the BBC Newsroom in London. As 
more military forces head to the Gulf, eight Arab states are calling 
on Iraq to back down. Egypt, Syria, and six Gulf countries say Baghdad 
must resume cooperation with United Nations weapons inspectors. But 
as Richard Downs reports from Baghdad, Iraq remains defiant. The Baghdad 
government is preparing for war. Tariq Aziz, the Deputy Prime Minister, 
gave one of the most outspoken performances of his life. He gave no 
indication that Iraq is willing to go back on its decision to break 
off all cooperation with the ONSCOM weapons inspectors. Mr. Aziz said 
it was the United States, which had created this crisis and America 
and Britain which were preparing the ground for war, barring a last 
minute intervention by someone of the stature of UN Secretary General, 
Kofi Annan, the two sides seem inexorably heading for a military conflict. 
Richard Downs, BBC News, Baghdad.
