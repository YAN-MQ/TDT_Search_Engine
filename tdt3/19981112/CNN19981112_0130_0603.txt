Doctors say a drug already on pharmacy shelves could help people with 
heart failure. Rhonda Rowland has more from the American heart association 
conference in dallas. 40-year-old Linda DeBeaumont is one of the 5 
million Americans living with congestive heart failure. Until now, 
doctors could do little more than offer to put this mother of two 
on a heart transplant waiting list. Before I got sick we used to camp, 
and we would hike, and we would, you know, we would bike ride, and 
we would do all these wonderful things. I was kind of in a position 
where if I wanted to keep up with them and there was any walking at 
all, I needed to go in a wheelchair. Now researchers report at the 
American heart association conference that a drug that's been around 
for 30 years, called aldactone, can save lives and help keep heart 
failure patients out of the hospital. The study results were so dramatic, 
scientists stopped the trial a year early. They say, in addition to 
standard therapy, aldactone reduced deaths by 27% and hospitalizations 
by almost one-third. So we think this is going to have a tremendous 
impact in the well-being of patients for heart failure -- save them 
hospitalization, keep them alive, at least in this severe group of 
patients, which is a very important, tough group to treat. Researchers 
also announced two other drugs for congestive heart failure show promise. 
Again, the studies were halted because the findings were so encouraging. 
Researchers found an inexpensive drug called gemfibrozil boosted the 
good cholesterol. And, as a result, heart attack and death was reduced 
by 22%, stroke by 24% and minor strokes by 60%. If your ldl cholesterol 
is low, and your hdl cholesterol is low, and that's about 25% of you 
heart disease patients, then I think that we've shown now that gemfibrozil's 
a really good option. a different study, following patients with mild 
to moderate angina or chest pain for 18 months, shows a drug known 
as a statin can attack the bad cholesterol, delaying or preventing 
the need for surgery. Scientists suggest patients with heart disease 
discuss the new findings with their doctors. Rhonda Rowland, CNN,
