I'm rose stabler with your "CNN Headline News" forecast. Another winter 
storm moves into the pacific northwest bringing rain and snow to the 
northwest. The big story, heavy rain once again over Texas. And by 
Saturday morning, the area of low pressure causing that rain will 
move into southwestern Louisiana around the lake Charles area. Continuing 
with heavy rainfall. Light snow flurries over the Great Lakes in the 
northern plains, but beautiful weather in New England, the Rockies, 
the central U.S. and portions of the east due to high pressure. High 
temperatures on Friday in the 30s in the Great Lakes, the northern 
plains and New England. Other than that, very cool to mild temperatures 
across the nation. Your extended forecast calling for rain in the 
northwest on Saturday with scattered showers and thunderstorms in 
the eastern half of the country. On Sunday, we're going to see some 
cool temperatures in the northern plains in New England with highs 
only in the 30s with showers over most the north and the southeast. 
And then on Monday, showers and thunderstorms throughout the eastern 
U.S. as well as the northwest. The cool weather continues over northern 
Minnesota and New England. Remember, you can get your four-day forecast 
for more than 7200 cities at cNN.com.
