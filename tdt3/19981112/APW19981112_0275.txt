Two police officers were killed and two others injured when their 
patrol vehicle was shattered by a land mine in the breakaway Georgian 
region of Abkhazia, the Interfax news agency reported Thursday. The 
attack happened Wednesday in the Gali district. Abkhazian authorities 
blamed the incident on Georgian irregular forces. Abkhazia, a Muslim 
region along the Black Sea, broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s 
after an independence struggle. Russian peacekeeping forces maintain 
an uneasy truce between Abkhazian and Georgian forces, but there are 
frequent clashes and attacks.
