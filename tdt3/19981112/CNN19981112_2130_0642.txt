That's Y2K bug looms as our society approaches the year 2000. Among 
the bug's many possible victims, the nation's nuclear weapons systems. 
Rick lock Ridge has more in this "tech trends." For nuclear weapons 
to work, a lot of things have to go right. Launch, targeting, delivery, 
all these critical steps are controlled by computer chips. All of 
those chips have to work together. That reliance on thousands of chips 
and millions of lines of computer code will appear to make nuclear 
weapons especially vulnerable to the year 2000 computer bug. Things 
are connected. No computer system, no information system communications 
or weapon is totally in isolation. This report by an anti-nuclear 
weapons group claims the department of defense will be unable to stop 
the bug from infesting thousands of nuclear weapons all over the world. 
The report singles out America's submarine-based missiles as well 
as russia's land-based nukes. It says China and all other nuclear 
powers will have trouble getting rid of the bug. It recommends deactivating 
all the world's nuclear weapons so there's no chance of a foul-up. 
This would get rid of completely the fear of surprise attack because 
what drives launch and warn sg the fear that there will be a bolt 
out of the blue. Pentagon officials declined a chance to directly 
address the report. Bau Pentagon spokeswoman did tell CNN "nuclear 
command and control centers have been given the highest priority and 
we feel that we are in pretty good shape there." The only point of 
agreement is that nobody can predict what the Y2K bug will do or not 
do until the new century arrives. Rick Lockridge, CNN, Washington.
