With air strikes imminent, or at least close, many of the potential 
targets in Iraq present difficult military and political problems. 
Even with new and improved weapons, air strikes will serve mostly 
to punish saddam Hussein and may not reduce whatever danger he may 
pose. Here's ABC's John McWethy. The new American weapons that may 
be used against Iraq, weapons with strange names like jdam, jsow and 
slam-ER. They are designed to allow pilots to release a bomb many 
miles from the target and to then guide it with precision while the 
pilot flies away. But there are limits to what even the best weapons 
can do to Saddam hussein's effort to build chemical and biological 
weapons? Judith yaphe is a former CIA analyst on Iraq. You will not 
be able to eliminate his weapons of mass destruction by air strikes, 
but you will be able to do damage to targets of value. Targets of 
value include factories and laboratories that could mass produce such 
weapons or the missiles to deliver them. Also on the list, institutions 
that protect the Iraqi leader, such as his secret police and revolutionary 
guards. Even then, the core of the Iraqi weapons program, its scientists 
and their research projects, will survive. A lot of them are just 
small laboratories that could be tucked away in buildings like schools 
and universities, which make them very difficult targets for air strikes. 
That is part of the dilemma for Washington. Saddam Hussein is likely 
to emerge from the rubble alive, still in control and thumbing his 
nose at the U.S. John McWethy, ABC News, the Pentagon.
