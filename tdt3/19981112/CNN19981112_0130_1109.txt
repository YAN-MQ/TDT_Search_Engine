With the possibility of a strike looming for fed ex, the company is 
announcing a plan that reduces its reliance on pilots. Fed ex's new 
plan would use more ground transportation and contract aircraft and 
crews from other companies. A pilots' strike could come during the 
busy holiday shopping season. The union is urging members to stop 
flying overtime next week, as pilots try to negotiate a first-ever 
contract with the cargo carrier.
