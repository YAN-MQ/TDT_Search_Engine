Paul Newman, purveyor of a dandy spaghetti sauce and a decent glass 
of lemonade, pours himself a cup of coffee. The threat of rain has 
delayed filming here on ``Where the Money Is,'' a Marek Kenievska 
caper co-starring Linda Fiorentino. So the man with two Oscars and 
a famous pair of blue eyes has a chance to sit in a hotel coffee shop 
and chat about one of his consuming passions, automobiles. That interest, 
which blossomed while he was filming the 1969 racing drama ``Winning'' 
with his wife, Joanne Woodward, inspired a second successful career, 
as a race-car driver, and a third as a race-team owner. (Newman and 
Carl Haas founded the respected Newman/Haas Racing team.) Behind the 
wheel, Newman has won four Sports Car Club of America national driving 
championships and claimed two Trans-Am victories, along with a second-place 
finish at LeMans. In 1995, at age 70, he entered the Guinness Book 
of World Records as the oldest driver to win a competitively sanctioned 
event, a GTS-class win at the 24 Hours of Daytona. Through the years, 
he has owned a succession of potent street cars, and last year he 
acquired part interest in a Volvo-Mazda dealership in Milford, Conn., 
not far from his Westport home. Off the track and out of his fire-retardant 
suit, Newman honed his acting craft while his Newman's Own food-products 
business grew beyond all expectations. (``It outgrosses my films,'' 
he said, only half joking.) He oversees the donation of all Newman's 
Own profits _ more than $80 million so far _ to a variety of charitable 
causes, including the Hole in the Wall Gang camps he founded for seriously 
ill children. As if all that did not keep him busy enough, he acquired 
a stake in the United States' oldest news weekly, The Nation, an institution 
known, like himself, for left-leaning views. Given many liberals' 
antipathy for cars and motor sports, it seemed natural to ask how 
he squares his politics and his sport. ``Well, I suppose everybody's 
entitled to a vice,'' he said with a chuckle. ``But seriously, I think 
if you do the math on it, you'll find out that football uses up more 
gasoline than automobile racing. Baseball, too. I mean, figure out 
what the spectators use in terms of gasoline getting to and from the 
games. The amount of gasoline that is used by the participants in 
a race is nothing compared to what it costs in terms of fuel to get 
there.'' Newman has burned plenty of fuel, even off the track, given 
his native enthusiasm for going fast. ``I'm not interested in off-the-line,'' 
he said. ``I'm interested in being able to get around trucks to get 
out of trouble. And when you get behind two trucks and a bus and you've 
got about 700 feet to pass all three of them, you'd better make sure 
that you've got a lot of stuff. Third- and fourth-gear stuff.'' While 
most of his Hollywood contemporaries have gone for gaudy road monsters 
and flashy Italian exotics, his automotive ideal is the low-key custom, 
the stealth machine, the street sleeper. For security reasons, he 
will not confirm that a couple of souped-up Volvos have passed through 
his garage in recent years, though he used such a car earlier this 
year to give a reporter a lift to the train station _ and the cantankerous 
beast broke down on the way. ``In the early days, I had Volkswagens 
with Porsche Super 90 engines,'' he said. ``And Rabbits with Callaway 
turbos. I also owned one Beetle that had a 351 Ford V8. ``Mostly because 
they were inconspicuous. You can park in front of a hotel and nobody 
pays any attention to it. It's not like banging up in a Ferrari. This 
way, you can move like a crab into the lobby.'' Certainly, he is reminded, 
there can be nothing stealthlike about a Beetle with a V8 residing 
where the back seat was meant to be. ``Yes, it really was hairy,'' 
he said. ``Great in a straight line, but boy, it never did the same 
thing twice.'' He remembers more fondly a loaner from his former racing 
backers at Nissan, ``a little gray four-door, a Maxima, with a turbo 
straight six that had been stroked. A real rocket.'' On one of the 
great enthusiasts' debates of today _ sport utility vehicles, yea 
or nay _ Newman has a foot in both camps. ``We move from one consumer 
fad to the next,'' he said. ``In 1973, everybody's running around 
buying Volkswagen diesels. And now they're buying Expeditions. And 
this is the thing that I don't understand about the government. As 
this fad grew, why they didn't insist on certain bumper heights _ 
I mean, it's criminal. ``And when an Expedition is 8 years old and 
it goes down to 7,000 bucks, there'll be a lot of kids buying them, 
and unfortunately it's the younger generation that's responsible for 
a lot of accidents. So you put a 17-year-old kid behind a 5,500-pound 
car and have them run into your blue-haired lady driving her Tercel 
Toyota. You know, it's going to be mayhem.'' He concedes that sport 
utilities are great for towing, and he has had one of his own. ``When 
Joanne was doing a play in the middle of the winter up in New Haven, 
we got one for her because I really wanted to have a four-wheel-drive 
car. And I wanted to put her in something heavy. It's defensive.'' 
Newman, born in Cleveland in January 1925, wasn't always a car fancier. 
His first car, bought while he was at Kenyon College, was a 1929 Ford 
Model A. ``Exuberant at winning a football game, I think, we set the 
whole thing on fire,'' he said. ``Then, after that, a 1937 Packard, 
which I drove all the way from Wisconsin back to Cleveland.'' Describing 
his introduction to racing, he is characteristically humble. ``I was 
very slow getting started,'' he said. ``It's just like anything else 
for me. I was really very slow as an actor, too. ``I was cautious. 
But like everything else, I was tenacious as hell. And I really was 
determined. So I didn't do any work at film from May until October 
for almost 15 years. I just wouldn't take a job. I think maybe once 
or twice I took jobs that kind of overlapped a month into the racing 
season or started a month before the season was over, but always with 
the thing that I could come down and run the runoffs down in Atlanta 
or run a couple of races for Trans-Am.'' He made the transition from 
well-heeled hobbyist to racer around 1979. ``And I was pretty good 
for about three or four years,'' he said. ``I don't mean this as whining, 
but really, ask Joanne, I have tried all sports,'' he said. ``But 
I really have no physical grace and the only thing that probably made 
me go fast is that I finally found some grace in the car.'' While 
he advises would-be racers to start young, he began his own racing 
career late, entering his first event at 47. Even now, at 73, he runs 
an occasional race and has high words of praise _ ``Delicious!'' _ 
for Panoz race cars he has driven, and for the Lotus Esprit road car. 
But he reckons he is ``not as fast as I used to be.'' ``I won the 
GT1 championship in '85 and '86 and then I really started to go downhill 
after that,'' he said. ``Drove a couple of races, drove for Oldsmobile 
for a year or two. I think it was probably everything _ I'm older, 
different crew chief. In Trans-Am, I would qualify in the top five 
almost every time, and then it was the top seven and then it was the 
top 10, and then it was the top 12.'' How did that feel? ``Bad _ but 
the lack of practice and getting older, it's got to catch up to you 
sooner or later.'' Still, unlike most racers, Paul Newman has several 
other careers to fall back on, and they're still moving at full speed. 
He hasn't hit the wall yet.
