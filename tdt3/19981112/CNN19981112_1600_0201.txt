More U.N. relief workers are heading out of Iraq as the threat of 
military action grows. Yesterday, all 120 U.N. weapons inspectors 
left. It's the first time in seven years the entire operation has 
been shut down. Tom Mintier has more. When they left Baghdad, many 
of these U.N. weapons inspectors probably wondered if they would ever 
return. The pullout was not only rapid but complete, something that 
had not occurred in previous standoffs with Iraq. Now they are in 
Bahrain waiting to see what the next move will be. Most spend the 
days shopping near the downtown hotel where they are staying. About 
90 inspectors remain here waiting to hear if and when they can return 
to their work. They tell us they're not very optimistic. Caroline 
cross, the official spokesperson for UNSCOM, says many of the inspectors 
regret having to leave. They are a very professional group of people. 
They know they are doing a difficult job. I think they feel the same 
as anybody who is set to do a task and then is stopped from completing 
that task. The inspectors will have no contact with local workers 
left behind in Baghdad. The monitoring equipment has remained in place, 
but the data will not be collected. There's no way we can undertake 
that activity now. Absolutely all UNSCOM monitoring and verification 
has stopped. It's not something that the Iraqi staff would do or would 
be able to do. So absolutely all work is suspended since our withdrawal. 
If the United States conducts air strikes against Baghdad, can the 
work of U.N. inspectors be continued after? It would depend on the 
level of the strike and how comprehensive it is and also the Iraqi 
response to that strike. Our work has always been dependent on full 
Iraqi cooperation. It seems the immediate future of the U.N. inspections 
is no longer in the hands of diplomats. If there is military action 
against Iraq, sites the inspectors wanted to see may not even be there 
if and when they return. Tom Mintier, CNN, Bahrain.
