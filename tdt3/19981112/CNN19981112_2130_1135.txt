The American league manager of the year should come as no surprise. 
"Headline Sports" is next. If you could accompany your data on its 
trip overseas the experience would be alarming. Local carriers handing 
it to national carriers over to cable carriers... till you don't know 
who has your data. Unless you send it through here. With the one and 
only company that owns the entire network-- local, national, and international. 
So you know who has your data. On-net. From MCI Worldcom. Introducing 
the all-new Jeep grand Cherokee. While it boasts a new vibration-reducing 
body structure, a quieter, more powerful engine, and an agile suspension 
for a superior level of refinement and quietness. Rest assured, it's 
still as rugged as ever. Welcome back, sir. The all-new Jeep grand 
Cherokee. Jerome Jurenovich, "CNN Headline Sports."
