Thousands have begun marching today on the parliament again. There 
are no reports of fresh violence with all of this. And there were 
no reports of violence in East Timor where tens of thousands of people 
commemorated the seventh anniversary of what's known as the Santa 
Cruz massacre when Indonesian troops opened fire on a group of East 
Timorese mourners. Jenny Grant is in Jakarta with our report. A crowd 
of 10,000 gathered at the Santa Cruz cemetery in the East Timorese 
capital of Dele and threw flowers on the graves of those killed in 
the massacre seven years ago. In a somber remembrance, they lit candles 
and sang songs in support of independent for the territory and from 
Indonesian control. According to official Indonesian government accounts 
of the Santa Cruz massacre, 50 people died when Indonesian soldiers 
opened fire on a crowd of mourners in November 1991. But church and 
human rights groups say 200 people died in the violence, which has 
become a symbol of East Timorese resistance against Indonesian rule. 
The people gathering followed a violent wake in East Timor. On Monday, 
pro independence rebels attacked a military base southeast of Dele. 
Three soldiers and one rebel died in the attack. This is Jenny Grant 
reporting for VOA News Now, Jakarta.
