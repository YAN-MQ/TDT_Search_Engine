President Boris Yeltsin presented Japan's prime minister with a plan 
Thursday to resolve the conflict that has divided their nations for 
more than half a century _ the ownership of the disputed Kuril Islands. 
Yeltsin warmly greeted Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi at the Kremlin, 
and later handed him Russia's long-awaited response to Japan's proposals 
to settle the dispute on the Kurils. The Russian plan calls for ``joint 
economic management'' of the islands, said Russian Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov. Also, the two leaders agreed to set up a subcommission 
to seek a solution to the territorial dispute. No additional details 
were released. The announcement was seen as a sign of progress, but 
a final agreement is expected to be a long, difficult process. Former 
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented Tokyo's proposals 
for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in Japan in April. 
The proposals have not been made public. According to media reports, 
Tokyo has suggested an arrangement that would recognize Japanese sovereignty 
over the islands, but would allow Russia to retain control for some 
time. Meanwhile, the two leaders were expected to sign previously 
resolved agreements on investment protection and cooperation in transport, 
tourism and environmental protection. ``It's good that our agreements 
are being implemented. I think we should fulfill the program,'' Yeltsin 
said at the outset of the meeting, according to the Interfax news 
agency. Still, the main task before the leaders was resolution of 
the dispute over four islands in the Kurils. The islands, known to 
Japanese as the Northern Territories, were once held by Tokyo but 
have been controlled by Moscow since the end of World War II. Both 
nations claim ownership, and the dispute is the main reason the two 
haven't signed a formal peace treaty ending the war. During a Yeltsin-Hashimoto 
summit a year ago, the leaders pledged to make the utmost effort to 
sign a peace treaty by 2000. But Japan wants the treaty to spell out 
the status of the Kurils. ``I believe that our generation carries 
the responsibility for making sure that the problems that have arisen 
in this century are solved before it is over and are not shifted to 
the shoulders of our children and grandchildren,'' Obuchi told the 
Russian daily newspaper Izvestia in an interview published Wednesday. 
Tokyo got legal control of the islands now in contention _ Etorofu, 
Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty with Russia 
in 1875. The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World 
War II, a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal. The islands 
have only about 17,000 Russian inhabitants, but the waters around 
them are rich fishing grounds. The summit was Yeltsin's first high-level 
meeting since his latest illness sidelined him a month ago. The president's 
office said Wednesday that the 67-year-old leader planned to visit 
Japan next spring or summer. Japan has announced plans to give an 
dlrs 800 million loan to Russia. The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 
billion bailout package arranged by the International Monetary Fund 
this summer. But the IMF and the World Bank have put their loans on 
hold after Russia succumbed to economic crisis in August. No timetable 
has been set for the release of the Japanese loan, but Obuchi's spokesman 
Sadaaki Numata said it ``would not be a months-long wait.''
