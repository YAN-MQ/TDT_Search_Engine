The U.S. defense industry is taking a big hit from the troubles in 
the global economy. Jennifer Auther reports. Thailand has postponed 
a purchase of 18 U.S. military fighter jets. South Korea recently 
suspended its contract with Boeing to buy four AWACS surveillance 
aircraft. Sales of U.S. arms have also dropped to Indonesia, Japan 
and the philippines. We account for one-third of Asia's imports of 
weapons systems. They tend to run about $2 billion a year. My guess 
is, what we're seeing will be a decline of somewhere maybe $300 million, 
$400 million a year for the next three or four years, which certainly 
hurts. Since the U.S. defense industry's total production at home 
amounts to about $45 billion, deferred Asian contracts are by no means 
a Death knell. But if you look at certain lines, such as the AWACS 
planes south Korea is unable to buy, Boeing is stuck. Their bottom 
line is going to be less. And that's the worrisome thing. The end 
result is that subcontractors such as northrup grummond are impacted 
because they make the electronics for the AWACS aircraft. Already, 
there have been high-profile layoffs among some U.S. defense giants, 
such as Raytheon. Retired air force lieutenant general Thomas McInerney 
says one way to offset all this would be to modernize at home. We 
are on a Titanic course. And if we don't change, then we're going 
to have to do what we did in the '80s and throw a significant amount 
of dollars, upwards to $40 billion to $60 billion a year, to resolve 
this problem. a small resolution may be on the way. $9 billion was 
added to the defense budget in October. That puts defense spending 
$280 billion, the highest since Ronald Reagan was in office. Jennifer 
Auther, CNN, Torrance, California.
