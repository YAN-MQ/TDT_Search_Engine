Ukraine's government is working on a schedule of daily budgetary receipts 
and expenditures until the end of the year to try to keep the fragile 
currency market stable, the central bank chief said Thursday. If the 
government manages to correctly foresee its revenues and expenditures 
in November and December, the hryvna currency will remain stable, 
National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said. ``The government has a 
chance to to effectively control the situation until the end of the 
year,'' Yushchenko said, according to the Interfax news agency. Ukraine 
has suffered badly from the economic crisis in neighboring Russia, 
but recently has managed to stabilize the hryvna and prevent steep 
price rises, largely by controlling government spending. Yushchenko 
said the National Bank's foreign currency reserves, currently at about 
dlrs 1 billion, have risen by more than 12 percent over the past month, 
a signal that the hryvna ``is in an absolutely stable position.'' 
However, the hryvna's further stability will depend on how the Cabinet 
raises revenues and controls its spending in the coming months, Yushchenko 
said. The Ukrainian government has chronically failed to collect taxes, 
which companies avoid because they say the rates are too high, and 
was slow to implement reforms needed to boost budget revenues. Enterprises' 
debt to the government skyrocketed this year to more than 11 billion 
hryvna (dlrs 3.2 billion). In order to stay afloat, the government 
has put off 6 billion hryvna (1.8 billion) in social welfare payments. 
Financier George Soros, currently on a visit to Ukraine, said Thursday 
that balancing the budget was the government's most serious problem. 
Without that, he said, Ukraine can hardly hope for rapid economic 
development and return of foreign investors. In a new attempt to raise 
badly needed cash, the Cabinet on Thursday introduced several dozen 
measures intended to encourage tax payments, boost banking activity, 
and make exporters return to Ukraine the earnings they hid abroad 
to avoid taxes. Tax authorities were also ordered to take additional 
steps to extract money from debtor companies, Finance Minister Ihor 
Mitiukov said. He said the government needs the money urgently to 
pay off its mounting foreign debt, now at dlrs 10.9 billion. The government 
also needs more revenues to keep the 1998 budget deficit at 2.5 percent, 
a key condition of the International Monetary Fund for disbursing 
a recently approved dlrs 2.2 billion loan to Ukraine. An IMF mission 
left Kiev last week unsatisfied with how the government has tackled 
tax collection and payment of wage debts, and urged it to introduce 
more reforms to qualify for the next tranche of the loan.
