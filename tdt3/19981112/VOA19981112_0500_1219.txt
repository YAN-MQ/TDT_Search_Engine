Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers have sent third baseman 
Bobby Bonilla back to the New York Mets in exchange for relief pitcher 
Mel Rojas. The 35-year-old Bonilla hit just 237 with seven home runs 
and 30 runs batted in 72 games with the Dodgers after being acquired 
in the deal that sent catcher, Mike Piazza, to the Marlins. Bonilla's 
days with the Dodgers were expected to be numbered after Davie Johnson 
was named as the team's new manager last month. Bonilla played for 
Johnson with the Baltimore Orioles and the two were often at odds. 
Mets manager Bobby Valentine says Bonilla will play the outfield. 
We're going to try to make a decision one position and not a multiple 
situation where he can get to spring training, start to work with 
Mookie Wilson on that one position and keep him there as often as 
he plays. The 31-year-old Rojas went five and two with earned run 
average of 6.05 in 50 games last year. But the reliever fell out of 
favor with Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who would not use him in 
close games.
