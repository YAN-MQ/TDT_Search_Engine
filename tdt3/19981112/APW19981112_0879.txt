Rahamim Karo walked along the wire fence outside his stone house Thursday 
and motioned toward the Palestinian village just 100 yards away. It's 
so close that on most mornings, Karo wakes up to the sound of Palestinian 
school children singing their national anthem, ``Biladi, biladi.'' 
For now, the Israeli army is still in charge in the area. But once 
Israel withdraws from West Bank land as part of the new peace agreement, 
Palestinian police will deploy in the village and the prospect is 
spooking many of Beit El's 5,000 residents. One day after the Israeli 
Cabinet approved the latest peace accord, the pulse of the settlers 
the day was a blend of apprehension, defiance and defeat. ``People 
feel this is another wave of adversity that we have to make it through 
but we are probably not aware of just how big this next wave will 
be,'' said Karo, 33, a janitor at a Beit El elementary school. Israel 
captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and ruled 
over the lives of its Palestinian population until the 1993 peace 
process began. Some 150,000 Israeli settlers and 1.6 million Arabs 
live on the land now which Palestinians want for a future state. When 
Israeli troops begin withdrawing from areas next week, Palestinians 
there will gain more freedom of movement, will not be subject to Israeli 
searches and troops will no longer be able to enter their villages. 
Karo and others including Helen Borer, a Manhattan native who moved 
to Beit El 21 years ago and lives there today with her eight children, 
said they fear a reduced Israeli troop presence will lead to everything 
from drive-by shootings, ambushes, car stonings and attacks on their 
property. Borer said despite her concerns for the future, she will 
not leave the settlement. And she dismissed defense ministry plans 
to furbish the community with anti-tank ditches and video surveillance 
systems. ``You can't fight a battle by erecting another wall, another 
moat. We are not living in the Middle Ages,'' Borer said, standing 
in the rose garden of Beit El's Jewish seminary where she works as 
a secretary. A survey conducted by Modaein Ezrahi, an Israeli polling 
firm, found that 41 percent of settlers oppose the Wye Accords. The 
poll, which had a margin of error of 5 percent surveyed 419 adults 
living in settlements all over the West Bank. Rivka, a 36-year-old 
nurse who wore a traditional black head scarf and like most religious 
Jewish women asked that her last name not be used, said she came to 
Beit El as an idealistic teenager. Today, however, she is less confidant 
of her mission. ``I want to live in a Jewish state, not a Palestinian 
state,'' she said, ``I felt like I was serving Israel and now I feel 
like I am a soldier left alone in the field.''
