President Clinton's special envoy to Africa has met in Guinea with 
an old ally of the U.S. civil rights movement, Stokely Carmichael. 
Speaking after meeting reactivists who have since changed his name 
to Kuami Turay, Jesse Jackson said Mr. Turay's efforts changed America 
for the better. Mr. Turay, who is being treated for prostate cancer 
in the West African nation is known for his fiery rhetoric against 
a U.S. in the 1960s.
