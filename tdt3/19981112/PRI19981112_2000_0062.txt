u.s. leaders are praising Arab criticism of Iraq. Eight Arab nations 
warned Iraq that failing to comply with the United Nations resolutions 
could bring serious consequences. A republican senator says a comprehensive 
effort to oust Saddam Hussein is needed. NPR's Peter Kenyan reports. 
The eight Arab nations including Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia say 
the Iraqi government is responsible for any consequences arising from 
its refusal to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors. The State Department 
held the statement as a good indicator of the breadth of world opinion 
against Iraq. On Capital Hill, Indiana Republican Senator Richard 
Lugar says air strikes are likely. But what is really needed is a 
serious move to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Lugar blames former 
president George Bush for not taking that step when allied ground 
troops were in Iraq during the Gulf War. He says whenever the Iraqi 
leader creates a standoff; the U.S. takes a minimalist approach involving 
long-distance air strikes. Lugar says sending troops back to Iraq 
is risky, but if Saddam Hussein remains, NATO will be back in a year 
wondering what to bomb next. Peter Kenyan, NPR News, Washington.
