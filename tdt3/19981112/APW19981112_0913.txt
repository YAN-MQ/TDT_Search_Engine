A Dutch newspaper was vindicated Thursday for publishing three recently 
discovered pages of Anne Frank's classic diary after a court said 
a printed apology was unnecessary. The lawsuit was brought by the 
Basel, Switzerland-based Anne Frank Fund, which holds the copyright 
to the best-selling ``Diary of Anne Frank'' by the young Jewish girl 
who hid with her family from the Nazis. It claimed that Het Parool, 
an Amsterdam daily, published the pages without its consent and had 
acted illegally. The group wanted Het Parool to print a front-page 
rectification and to stop quoting from the new pages or sending copies 
to other media. But in a written decision, an Amsterdam District Court 
judge rejected that request and ordered the Swiss organization to 
pay the newspaper's court costs. ``The decision is good for the freedom 
of the press,'' said Willem van Manen, a lawyer for the newspaper. 
The diary pages appeared on the front page of Het Parool on Aug. 26, 
and later on its Internet site. The newspaper ran them days after 
a Dutch scholar's startling announcement that he had five previously 
unknown handwritten pages he said Anne's father gave him shortly before 
his death in 1980. Het Parool contended it adhered to copyright rules 
because the pages ordinarily would have been published along with 
the rest of the famed diary if Otto Frank hadn't kept them separate 
from the rest of the manuscript. Their sheer newsworthiness also justified 
the publication, the paper argued. Germ Kemper, a lawyer for the Anne 
Frank Fund, said the court has clearly put news reporting before the 
interests of copyright holders. ``Copyright holders need to be protected 
from unauthorized publications,'' he said. The diary controversy began 
in August, when longtime Frank family friend Cor Suijk revealed the 
existence of the pages, in which Anne criticized her parents' marriage. 
Anne and her family fled Nazi Germany before World War II and hid 
in a secret annex in an Amsterdam canal house from July 1942 until 
they were betrayed in August 1944. Aspiring to be a writer, Anne chronicled 
their cramped existence in her diary, which was published posthumously. 
It has been translated from Dutch into more than 50 languages and 
has sold millions of copies worldwide. Anne died in the Bergen-Belsen 
concentration camp in March 1945, just three months before her 16th 
birthday.
