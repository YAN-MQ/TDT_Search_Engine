What's 36 feet long, has 100 razor-sharp teeth, foot-long claws and 
a head shaped like a giant crocodile? he is. A newly discovered species 
of dinosaur unearthed in the Sahara desert and reconstructed by the 
folks at "national geographic." This guy was as big as the fearsome 
T-Rex, and probably ate mostly fish. Scientists say he was tough enough 
to have taken on just about anything back in his day, which was 100 
million years ago.
