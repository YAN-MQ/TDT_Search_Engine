President Clinton will push his child care agenda during a White House 
ceremony today. He plans to announce a program to provide more funding 
for after-school programs. Mr. Clinton talked about the $22 billion 
plan earlier this year during his state of the union address. The 
plan was to be partially funded by money from tobacco companies, but 
congress failed to approve the deal.
