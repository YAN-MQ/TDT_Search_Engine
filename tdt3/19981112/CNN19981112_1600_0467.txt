Russian President Boris Yeltsin is warning of "chaos and social upheavals." 
He's not talking about the economy. He's responding to comments by 
a communist party member of parliament who said Jews are "bloodsuckers" 
who should be rounded up and jailed. Yeltsin did not mention the official 
by name or refer directly to anti-semitism when he ordered top security 
officials to stop what he calls "National and political extremism." 
Communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov says he has assured the Israeli 
ambassador his party deplores anti-semitism.
