Incumbent senator, Harry Reid, held on to his narrow victory over 
republican challenger, John Enson* today after a nine-day ballot review 
in one Nevada county. Some 6,000 votes in the county were improperly 
counted because they did not fit into tallying devices. The recount 
gave Enson, a congressman, 100 more votes compared with 42 more for 
Reid. That makes Reid the winner by only about 400 votes out of more 
than 400,000 that were cast. Reid's victory means that republicans 
failed to gain any new seats in the U.S. Senate. Enson has not decided 
yet whether to ask for a formal, statewide vote count.
