Time now for a look at the weather across the country. For that, we 
go to WNBC-TV in New York, meteorologist Janice huff. I saw you talking 
about this weather system this afternoon. It is violent. Yes, it was. 
Were you awake this morning when the winds hit our area? We had gusts 
of 50 miles per hour in the New York City area this morning. Same 
storm system, a little too warm for snow here, but certainly wind 
and rain. Moving now it's all off shore, everybody's glad to see this 
one go. Things have even calmed down across the upper midwest where 
they had the blizzard. Still a few light snow flurries, but quieter 
tonight. In the southwest, getting snow up around northern Arizona, 
the mogollon rim, and icy conditions there. Rain ending in California 
tonight with the storm moving east. 55 degrees right now in Los Angeles. 
It's 58 in Phoenix at this hour. But still cold across the northern 
plains. Wind chill values once again be down to the single digits, 
near zero tonight. The wind not as strong as last night, but still 
quite cold there. Look at the teens and 20's. Across the southern 
states into Tennessee tonight, highs will rebound in the 60's tomorrow. 
70's and 80's for south Florida. Still quite cold over the northern 
plains, where the high will reach 33 tomorrow in Minneapolis. Look 
for some snow around Denver tomorrow, 46. 70's in Los Angeles and 
Phoenix. Showers in Dallas and Seattle. On the eastern seaboard, though, 
nice, not bad. 50's up here up to Boston and down to D.C. now, looks 
like the jet stream, the northern branch, will take a little bits 
of a shift by Saturday, letting a little bit of cold air into New 
England. Most of the mid atlantic states though will remain mild or 
season for this time of year. Another storm system will set up snow 
showers over the northern Great Lakes and rain showers down across 
the midwest and into the Tennessee river valley. Warm temperatures 
for south Florida and the southwest. Another storm system rolls to 
the pacific northwest by the weekend. Looks like they'll be seeing 
snow showers in the higher elevations. That's the weather around the 
nation, Brian. Back to you.
