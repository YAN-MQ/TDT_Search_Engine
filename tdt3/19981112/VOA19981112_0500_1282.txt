Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig is concerned about runaway 
spending by team owners. Clubs have guaranteed a staggering $2.18 
billion to 493 players through the year 2003. While some teams are 
certain to be hard pressed to meet their long-term obligations, baseball 
fans will feel a huge impact to help pay the bill. Ticket prices increased 
by 20 of 28 teams last season will be boosted again by most clubs. 
That will force the average ticket price to more than $12. Spending 
money has proven to be successful. Only one team with a payroll of 
more than $48 million had a losing record. Conversely, only one team 
with a payroll of less than $47 million had a winning record.
