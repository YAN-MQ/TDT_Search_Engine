Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Thursday backed U.S. military pressure 
on Iraq, urging President Saddam Hussein ``with great seriousness'' 
to end the latest standoff with U.N. weapons inspectors. Iraq must 
fulfill United Nations resolutions on the arms inspections, the German 
leader said in a statement. ``Only on this basis is a political solution 
of the conflict between Iraq and the international community possible,'' 
Schroeder said. The German government issued a travel warning for 
Iraq on Thursday, advising all Germans on nonessential business to 
leave and advising against travel to the country.
