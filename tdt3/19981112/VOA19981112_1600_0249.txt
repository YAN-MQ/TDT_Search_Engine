The prime ministers of Russia and Japan meet Friday in hopes of achieving 
a breakthrough on a long-running territorial dispute. VOA's Peter 
Heinline reports from Moscow. At issue is the future of four Pacific 
islands Russia controls but Japan claims. The dispute prevented the 
two countries from signing a peace treaty at the end of World War 
II. Japan this year proposed a deal whereby Russia would give up sovereignty 
over the islands but maintain temporary administrative control. But 
in talks with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi Thursday, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin made a counter proposal that would 
involve joint economic development of the islands. The idea seems 
to have appealed to Mr. Obuchi. After the meeting, a Japanese spokesman 
told reporters the two countries are solidly on the way to a peace 
treaty by the year 2000. Substantive talks on the dispute are on tap 
Friday when Mr. Obuchi meets the Russian prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
