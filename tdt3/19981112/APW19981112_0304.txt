More women can now view seven frescos of the Virgin Mary painted 200 
years ago by Francisco Goya at the Aula Dei monastery. On Wednesday, 
Queen Sofia opened a special passageway built in the 16th-century 
wine cellar of the monastery in northeastern Spain near Zaragoza. 
``The idea was to allow women, as well as men, to see the frescos 
without disturbing the monastic order,'' said Rosa Pellicero, a local 
government spokeswoman. Before the special passageway, only three 
women _ another member of the royal family, a judicial secretary and 
a female restorer _ had seen the frescos painted in the chapel by 
a 28-year-old Goya in 1774. The monks, who belong to the Roman Catholic 
Cartesian order and follow strict sex-segregation norms dating back 
900 years, agreed to the passageway after the Goya bicentenary celebrations 
in 1996 brought unwanted attention to their ban on women. Not that 
the old Spanish master's frescos will suddenly be unveiled to all. 
Visits have to be booked, and with just one showing every month, reservations 
are full until February.
