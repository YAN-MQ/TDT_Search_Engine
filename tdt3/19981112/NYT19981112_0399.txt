Contentious dispute between the two associations representing advertisers 
and agencies, which began when the advertiser association unexpectedly 
extended membership to agencies, is growing more pronounced as some 
longtime agency executives express their qualms about the invitation. 
The concerns are being voiced a month after officials of the Association 
of National Advertisers stunned the leaders of the American Association 
of Advertising Agencies by revealing that they would open their ranks 
of paying members to agencies. The proposal was couched in terms of 
the benefits of agencies joining with clients to bolster efforts to 
build brands. To help draw attention to the new welcome mat, Denis 
Beausejour, vice president for advertising at Procter &AMP; Gamble 
Co. in Cincinnati _ the world's largest advertiser _ sent brief, encouraging 
letters to the heads of 11 P&AMP;G agencies, including Leo Burnett 
Co., Grey Advertising and the Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi unit of Saatchi 
&AMP; Saatchi PLC. ``The opportunity to have agencies participate 
in the ANA will help us create a much stronger voice for brand building,'' 
Beausejour wrote, adding, ``I will look forward to handling any questions 
you may have on this.'' One reason the new policy startled the agency 
association leaders was that they were notified only moments before 
it was announced from the stage during a general session of the 89th 
annual conference of the advertiser association in Naples, Fla. Other 
agency executives found out only later. ``I was stunned,'' said David 
Bell, president and chief executive at Bozell Worldwide in New York, 
a unit of True North Communications. ``In an era when there has been 
greater-than-ever cooperation between the associations,'' he asked, 
``why would anyone launch such a program without having discussed 
it?'' Last week, O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of 
the agency association, known as the Four A's, wrote cautionary letters 
to senior management of 25 large agencies that are likely to be solicited 
for membership in the advertiser association. The letter-writing campaign 
was reported this week by the trade publication Advertising Age. ``As 
proposed, what the ANA is seeking is free marketing advice for their 
members from the top agencies in the business,'' Drake wrote, ``advice 
the agencies will have to PAY to give.'' ``Although the ANA has stated 
that raising money is not the purpose of this,'' he added, ``the cost 
of full membership in the ANA would be a significant additional expense 
for our agencies.'' Advertisers and agencies have cooperated on important 
matters of mutual interest ``via joint committees, task forces and/or 
coalitions,'' Drake wrote. ``I know of no reason why we cannot do 
the same'' in this instance. Drake, in a telephone interview yesterday 
from his office in New York, demurred at a suggestion that he was 
stepping up a fight with the advertiser association. ``I'm not trying 
to go to war with the ANA,'' he said. ``The Four A's will go on regardless 
how this turns out.'' ``But it's incumbent on me to give something 
in writing to my members expressing my point of view,'' he added, 
which is in essence that the proposal was ``a stupid idea'' and ``not 
very well thought out.'' Susan Pralgever, a spokeswoman for John Sarsen, 
president and chief executive of the advertiser association in New 
York, said he was traveling Thursday and could not be reached for 
comment. The letter duel _ and the increasingly loud buzz about the 
widening rift between the two trade organizations _ is being taken 
seriously by several Madison Avenue veterans. ``We're all for anything 
that builds the value of brands,'' said Edward Wax, chairman emeritus 
of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York, who advises the agency on association 
relations, ``and we welcome any opportunity to work closely with the 
ANA.'' ``But personally, I don't think agencies need to become members 
of the ANA to work hand in hand with advertisers,'' he added. ``ANA 
represents the advertisers, and they have some goals that aren't necessarily 
the same as ours.'' Bell, a former chairman of the agency association, 
said that he was worried about the expense of paying dues to an additional 
organization; such fees can cost $100,000 annually. If the goal is 
``to bring us together for the purposes of brand building,'' Bell 
said, ``I wish the ANA would consider an associate membership at a 
more afforable cost.'' Another association, the American Advertising 
Federation, which includes advertisers, agencies and media companies 
as members, has formed a task force to assess the implications of 
the shift by the advertiser association. ``There's a real challenge 
here,'' said Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the federation 
in Washington. ``It's time for groups to work together, not split 
apart in internecine warfare.'' Snyder said he was not worried that 
agencies would cancel memberships in the federation if they joined 
the advertiser association because of the federation's focus on other 
programs like ``grass-roots lobbying in 220 markets, cultural diversity'' 
and advertising education. ``Our dues mailings went out in late October,'' 
he added. ``We'll know for sure when the dollars come in.'' The testy 
debate between advertisers and agencies should not be allowed to obscure 
some fundamental verities, an advertising educator asserted. ``Maybe 
there was another way to introduce it,'' said Robert Lauterborn, who 
attended the advertiser conference, ``but the principle that agencies 
should be treated as marketing partners instead of second-class citizens 
makes all the sense in the world.'' ``This isn't us against them,'' 
said Lauterborn, the James L. Knight professor of advertising at the 
School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill. ``Branding is the business both are in.'' 
Many chief executives who received letters from Drake were not available 
to discuss whether they planned to join the advertiser association, 
according to spokesmen at their agencies, who described them as ``out 
of town,'' ``traveling'' and ``off site.'' One spokesman, questioned 
about all the similar explanations, replied, ``In this case, it's 
true.''
