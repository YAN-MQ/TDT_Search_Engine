Those recent mideast peace talks in Maryland almost brought about 
the resignation of CIA director George Tenet. A Clinton administration 
official says Tenet threatened to quit if the president agreed to 
release convicted spy Jonathan pollard. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu 
claimed the release of pollard would help him gain support back home 
for the wye river accords. Tenet insisted the move would destroy his 
credibility in the agency. Mr. Clinton declined to release pollard, 
but agreed to review the case.
