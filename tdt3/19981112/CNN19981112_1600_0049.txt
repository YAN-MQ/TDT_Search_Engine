More pieces are falling into place for a U.S. military attack against 
Iraq. The current standoff in the gulf began a week and a half ago, 
when Iraq stopped cooperating with United Nations weapons inspectors 
and demanded the lifting of economic sanctions. More U.S. military 
hardware and personnel are being sent to the region. And more U.N. 
workers are being evacuated from Baghdad. Eight Arab nations are warning 
Iraq it should not count on their support in the dispute. But the 
country isn't backing down. Deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz is blaming 
the United States for "Poisoning the whole situation." Go ask the 
men and women in the street whether they are scared of the american 
bombing. They are not. For a simple reason, not because they are defiant. 
They are human being. They are fathers and mothers. They would like 
to live in peace. But they are not scared because it makes no difference 
to them. Sanctions is a war by itself. It's killing the Iraqis and 
it's destroying Iraq. So the American threats to use force doesn't 
make any difference to the ordinary citizen of Iraq. It makes no difference. 
The state department says Iraq should stop lying and obscuring facts. 
Spokesman James Rubin says the country alone is responsible for what's 
going on. As for military action, U.S. defense secretary William Cohen 
says there is still hope it can be avoided. But if that doesn't happen, 
he warns an attack will be carried out with all the effectiveness 
the U.S. can Marshal. President Clinton's national security team will 
meet in two hours to consider the U.S. options. Clearly, Iraq is desperately 
trying to shift the blame for this crisis away from its shoulders, 
away from its doorstep, to the United States, and I think what we've 
seen in the last couple of days is that that effort is failing completely 
and totally. If the United States and the U.S. simply say it's okay, 
we're not going to enforce the security council resolutions. If we 
don't do that, then for all practical purposes, the security council 
has lost credibility. The resolutions become meaningless. He is able 
to achieve his goals of not complying and yet getting relief from 
the restrictions without consequence.
