In 1944, during World War II, Waldor Yarrington was a crewman on a 
Navy patrol plane that sunk a Japanese submarine. Now more than half 
a century later, he says he hopes to see that submarine again. The 
primary reason isn't nostalgia but gold. Researchers believe the sub 
was carrying nearly 150 bars of gold when it went down. Investors 
figure the gold off the Cape Verne in the Atlantic Ocean could be 
worth $22 million.
