Three-time all-star Mo Vaughn says it's time to begin a new chapter, 
and that's what he plans to do. Late last night, the former A.L. MVP 
rejected Boston's final offer, which would have made him the highest-paid 
red sox player in history. Anaheim has reportedly offered Vaughn a 
six-year, $72 million deal. Meanwhile, CNN/"sports illustrated" has 
learned that the Arizona diamondbacks have offered free agent slugger 
Bernie Williams a seven-year, $100 million contract. As for Williams' 
former teammate in New York, David cone, he agreed to a One-year contract 
with the Yankees worth $8 million. Incentives could pop that up to 
$9.5 million.
