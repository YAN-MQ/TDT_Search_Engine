Signaling changed attitudes across the Arab world, eight Arab foreign 
ministers declared Thursday that Iraq would be ``held responsible 
for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of U.N. weapons 
inspectors. The diplomatic phrase was the clearest sign yet of a remarkable 
reversal in Arab sentiments amid signs that a U.S. military strike 
may be imminent. During a similar standoff over U.N. inspections in 
February, the Arab world was outraged at the prospect of a U.S. attack. 
At that time, hundreds of Palestinians paraded a model of an Iraqi 
Scud missile and chanted ``Beloved Saddam, Hit Tel Aviv.'' Yemenis 
jumped off buses to join anti-American protests, and in Jordan, police 
had to use attack dogs to keep demonstrators at bay. The mood is far 
different today. Rather than anger, a sense of resignation prevails. 
``Kuwait cannot stop a superpower from taking certain steps,'' said 
Kuwaiti foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, after the 
meeting in Doha, Qatar, of foreign ministers from Syria and Egypt 
as well as six Gulf states: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United 
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Twenty-five more U.N. employees left 
Iraq on Thursday, joining 233 U.N. inspectors and relief workers who 
departed a day earlier. And few in the region believe Iraq is prepared 
to back down from its Oct. 31 decision to end the inspections. ``The 
question now is what will this strike be like? What will its size 
be and what will be the end?'' asked columnist Abdullah al-Shayegi 
in Kuwait's Al-Watan newspaper Thursday. That perception was echoed 
in Al-Wafd, one of Egypt's most popular newspapers, whose banner headline 
Thursday read, ``The countdown begins for the strike on Iraq.'' In 
the statement after the meeting Thursday _ a declaration that was 
praised by the United States _ the foreign ministers expressed hope 
that ``wisdom and reason prevail'' so as not to worsen hardships for 
already miserable Iraqis. The call has been echoed in the statements 
of nearly all Arab countries since the buildup began. But diplomatic 
efforts seems to be less active than during the last crisis. Then, 
Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid took the unusual 
step of flying to the Iraqi capital to meet President Saddam Hussein 
in a show of solidarity. This time, from Cairo, he urged the Iraqis 
to show ``flexibility.'' The softer tones in Arab capitals may not 
be coincidental. Some Arab diplomats have said U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen told leaders on his tour this month of the Gulf as well 
as Egypt and Jordan, that if the governments did not agree with an 
attack, they should keep the criticism to themselves. Resentment remains, 
though, at what many Arabs see as the double standard in Washington's 
prosecution of the sanctions against Iraq and its patience with Israel 
in the peace process. ``This duplicity in American policy, the flagrant 
hostility to Arab rights and the extreme bias in favor of Israel has 
proven that the American administration has no credibility,'' said 
Tishrin, a Syrian newspaper that speaks for the government.
