German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine denied media reports Thursday 
that he was a candidate to succeed Jacques Santer as the European 
Commission president. A Social Democratic European parliamentarian, 
Klaus Haensch, told Saarlaendischer Rundfunk radio that he is promoting 
Lafontaine as a candidate for the post. ``It's Germany's turn to occupy 
this post,'' Haensch said. A German last held the commission presidency 
from 1958-67. Germany already has sought French support for a German 
candidate, the weekly Die Zeit reported in its latest edition, published 
Thursday. But Lafontaine issued a statement rejecting ``rumors and 
speculation'' that he planned to take the Brussels job as ``nonsense.'' 
In Brussels, European Commission spokeswoman Martine Reichert declined 
to comment on the report that Lafontaine would succeed Santer, whose 
five-year term expires at the end of 1999. Under EU rules, the commission 
president is selected by the 15 EU governments, each of which has 
the right to put forward a candidate, and their choice must be ratified 
by the European Parliament. Lafontaine already has substantial influence 
in the new Social Democratic-led German government, occupying both 
the party's top post and running the Finance Ministry as Germany joins 
10 other European countries in the monetary union launching Jan. 1.
