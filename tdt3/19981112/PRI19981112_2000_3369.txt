It seems that wherever you go around the world, local musicians have 
translated the American pop music styles of rap and hip-hop and have 
come up with a variety of successful and not-so-successful results. 
One of America's greatest contributions to music, jazz, appears much 
less on international hit parades, until now. Swedish pop singer, 
Lisa Echdahl* has always been partial to America's great songbook 
and now she has released a no-nonsense album of jazz tunes with at 
trio composed of base, drums and piano. Apart from the distinctive 
Betty Boop-like phrasing, there is another surprise. This CD of mostly 
Cole Porter standards, has become a big hit in Swedish record stores 
and on the radio there. Lisa Echdahl, backed up by the Peter Nordahl* 
trio, show why on this sultry cover of Night and Day.
