Research could have an impact on the future of organ transplants according 
to the "New York Times." Scientists at a biotechnology company say 
they have found a way to make human cells revert to the embree onic 
state from which all other cells develop. Researchers say that was 
done by fusing human cells with cow eggs creating a hybrid cell. The 
company says the research could eventually be used to grow replacement 
body tissue from a patient's own cells.
