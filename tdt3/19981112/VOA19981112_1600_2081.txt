U.S. agents are investigating a shot fired at the task force command 
post overseeing the search of North Carolina for multiple bombing 
suspect Eric Rudolph. Officials say a shot was fired late Wednesday 
at the command post nearly hitting a federal agent as described by 
Attorney General Janet Reno. One agent was slightly injured, grazed 
by the shot through literally the hair on his head, and he's very, 
very fortunate. Investigators are trying to determine whether the 
shot was accidental or intentional. Federal agents have been searching 
for months in the western North Carolina mountains for Eric Rudolph, 
an experienced back woodsman. The suspect is charged with several 
bombings, including the 1996 Olympic park bombing in Atlanta, Georgia 
that killed one person and wounded more than a hundred others.
