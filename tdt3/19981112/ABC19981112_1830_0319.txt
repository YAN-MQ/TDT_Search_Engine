And in some ways thumbing his nose at millions of Iraqis, who have 
no say whatsoever in anything he decides to do. ABC's Sheila MacVicar 
is in Baghdad tonight. She reports that most Iraqis are resigned to 
whatever happens. People in Baghdad have been through this before. 
They all know what is facing them now. What do you think? It's usual. 
It has become part of life here. A trip to the markets today showed 
there is no panic buying, in part because most Iraqis no longer have 
enough money to stockpile food. Today, many people were talking about 
stockpiling water. If there is no water, we can't live. Water is very 
necessary. So what do you do? We put water in big tankers in our homes. 
And they buy a few candles and think about what they will tell their 
families to do. To stay in the house. That's all. Don't go outside, 
because the attack, maybe it will hurt them. Staying home, hoping 
to be safe, is for many, the only option. Some even suggest their 
government is not doing enough to protect them. It could be serious. 
Bomb shelters here are for the rich and influential. These people 
say they have made none of the choices that have brought Iraq to this 
point and ask why the United States wants to hurt them. People are 
already dying. In the market, the people shrug off fear because they 
can do nothing about it. Sheila MacVicar, ABC News, Baghdad.
