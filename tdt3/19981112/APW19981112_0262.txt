A freight train collided with a commuter bus at an unmanned railway 
crossing in Sudan's capital of Khartoum, killing four people and injuring 
50 others, hospital officials said Thursday. The accident occurred 
late Wednesday in the Kalakla suburb, the daily newspaper, Alwan, 
reported. The train pushed the bus more than 75 meters (250 feet), 
rolling it several times, witnesses told The Associated Press. Among 
the injured, seven were in critical condition, said the hospital officials, 
who refused to be named, said. All the casualties were from the bus.
