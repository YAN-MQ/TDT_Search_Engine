Ask cabdrivers in Rome if they like their jobs, and the uniform reply 
is an operatic screed about the petty bureaucratic rules, clogged 
traffic, high cost of gasoline and dearth of clients. But when the 
mayor of Rome proposed allowing drivers to set their own prices and 
hours, the answer was a series of strikes that culminated in a four-day 
citywide taxi blackout. Thursday hundreds of striking cabdrivers parked 
in Piazza Venezia in the heart of the city and next to the mayor's 
office, blocking all traffic. ``This is dictatorship, dictatorship, 
dictatorship,'' Carlo Bologna, head of the strike committee, said. 
Bologna, who has taken to using the nom de guerre Spartacus, complained 
that the effort to liberalize tariffs and shifts would never work 
and would impoverish drivers. He wore a sling on his right hand, injured 
during a speech Wednesday when he pounded a desk that turned out to 
be marble, not wood. The taxi revolt is not new in Italy, which is 
also plagued by wildcat and union-sanctioned strikes throughout the 
transportation industry, from air controllers in Milan to telegraph 
operators at sea. But the taxi strike highlights how even independent 
service operators cling to a statist status quo. Italy, still burdened 
by crippling bureaucracy and inflexibility in the work force, is slowly 
seeking to liberalize its economy. But like the shop owners who went 
on strike last year to protest a law setting their store hours and 
raising the number of licenses, cabdrivers fear change. ``Healthy 
competition can only help consumers and drivers,'' said Walter Tocci, 
the deputy mayor of Rome, who is also the city's Traffic Commissioner. 
``I'm an ex-Communist, and even I cannot believe that the rules of 
Adam Smith apply to every economic sector except taxis.'' He noted 
that the city had acted only after Italy's antitrust commission determined 
that Roman cabdrivers operated as a kind of cartel. Italian taxis 
are costly even by the standards of other European capitals and New 
York. The drop rate on the meter starts at $2.80 in Rome, compared 
with $2 in New York and $2.40 in Paris. Roman taxis, which do not 
cruise, can almost never be hailed. Customers line up at taxi stands 
or summon a cab by telephone through a dispatcher. The meter starts 
running when the driver accepts the call, not when they pick up the 
fare. Bologna complained that 8 out of 10 of his clients were tourists, 
because, he said, ``Romans think taxis are too expensive.'' But he 
added that the city government was to blame for not taming Rome's 
notoriously clogged traffic. Roman taxi rates soar in stalled traffic, 
according to city officials, when the charge rises to 50 cents a minute, 
compared with 20 cents in New York. Mayor Francesco Rutelli proposed 
that cabs continue to use a meter to set maximum limits, but that 
drivers be allowed to decide whether they want to waive or lower a 
drop charge, as well as other extras like a $3 night charge (it is 
50 cents in New York), or baggage fees. Roman cabdrivers are limited 
to seven-and-half-hour shifts, but the mayor infuriated cabbies by 
saying they should set their own schedules, driving as little or as 
much as they like, with a six-hour minimum. He also suggested that 
family members be allowed to put in extra hours driving. ``He wants 
us to get our wives and children to drive the cab, but my 23-year-old 
son is about to graduate with a degree in biology,'' said Giancarlo 
De Murtas, 57, a 33-year veteran of the trade whose father was a cabdriver. 
``I made sacrifices so he wouldn't have to do this job.'' Under the 
threat of liberalization, however, cabdrivers known for grousing about 
their beastly conditions are now talking wistfully about a paradise 
lost. ``It's the greatest job in the world,'' Bologna said. ``You 
have freedom, you learn a lot, and you get to flirt with lots of pretty 
foreign tourists.''
