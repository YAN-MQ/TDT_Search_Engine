The master at one of Yale University's undergraduate residential colleges 
has resigned after federal officials seized two of his office computers 
and told him he was the subject of a child-pornography investigation. 
FBI agents raided the master's office last Friday after being tipped 
to a possible crime by the campus police, according to Yale and federal 
officials. A few hours later, Antonio Lasaga, a professor of geochemistry, 
resigned the mastership of Saybrook College and took an indefinite, 
paid leave of absence from his duties as a professor, Yale officials 
said. An official at the U.S. attorney's office in New Haven said 
a child pornography investigation was continuing, but no charges had 
been filed. Yale President Richard Levin said he knew of no previous 
complaints about Lasaga. ``Tony Lasaga has been a very popular and 
energetic presence on this campus,'' Levin said in an interview Thursday. 
``So naturally this news is distressing and of great concern to all 
of us.'' Levin said he became aware of the investigation on Nov. 4. 
On Nov. 5, he arranged for a new master, citing an impending ``emergency 
situation,'' but did not tell the replacement which college was involved. 
The next morning, agents bearing a search warrant arrived at Lasaga's 
apartment, which is adjacent to his office at Saybrook. Lasaga, 48, 
became a Yale professor in 1984 and was Saybrook's master for the 
last three years. He and his wife lived in an apartment at the college, 
which occupies the north end of the university's Memorial Quadrangle. 
Lasaga, a well-known figure at national conferences on geochemistry, 
received the Mineralogical Society of America's award of the year 
in 1986. The raid and resignation touched off a flurry of concern 
and speculation among students, who talked about Lasaga in reverential 
tones. And the episode has put a spotlight on Yale's system of 12 
undergraduate residential colleges, which serve as dormitories, dining 
halls and social centers for groups of about 425 students, who are 
guided in their academic studies by a dean and in their social lives 
by a master. Students recalled the master's teas, Friday happy hours 
(with tea as the beverage) and Halloween parties thrown by Lasaga, 
whom they still referred to as ``our master.'' They said they were 
as concerned about him as about the possible breach of trust. ``I 
continue to respect Master Lasaga just as I did before,'' said Daniel 
Fingerman, 20, an economics and political science major from Oakland, 
Calif.
