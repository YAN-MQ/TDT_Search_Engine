Today in a federal court, Microsoft tried to counter government claims 
that it threatened rival computer executives. In a cross-examination 
of a government witness, Microsoft's lawyers tried to use the testimony 
of the Intel executives to dispute the claim that microsoft used its 
monopoly power to force Intel from developing competing multimedia 
software. The cross-examination continues tomorrow. Microsoft stock 
fell 2 5/16 today.
