Serb civilians detained dozens of Albanians on Thursday, threatening 
to kill some of them unless two Serbs apparently abducted by separatist 
guerrillas were released, a Kosovo Albanian organization said. Civilians 
with submachine guns stopped vehicles carrying ethnic Albanians, demanding 
the release of two fellow Serbs who disappeared Wednesday, the Kosovo 
Information Center said. The center reflects the views of the main 
ethnic Albanian political party in the Serbian province. Up to 100 
had been detained by early Thursday on a main road near the border 
to Montenegro, which makes up Yugoslavia along with Serbia. Dozens 
of the detained Albanians were taken away to the village of Crnac, 
30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Pristina. Some of them phoned 
Pristina to relay their abductors' demands for the release of the 
two Serbs. ``If we failed to do this, they said they would kill us,'' 
Ismet Haziri, one of those taken by the Serbs, was quoted by the center 
as saying Serb sources confirmed the abduction but said those taken 
were being released. William Walker, the American diplomat heading 
of an effort to carry out a peace deal in Kosovo promised to ``take 
appropriate steps'' after finding out exact circumstances of the abductions. 
The detentions reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian tensions 
in Kosovo even after an Oct. 12 agreement to end the crisis. The crackdown 
on ethnic Albanians seeking independence has left hundreds dead and 
made refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
