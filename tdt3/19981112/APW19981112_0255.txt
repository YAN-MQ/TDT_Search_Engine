Vandals in eastern Bohemia damaged a cemetery monument to Jewish girls 
tortured by Nazis and knocked over or smashed headstones around it, 
police said Thursday. ``Death to Jews'' was spray-painted on the monument 
in Trutnov early Wednesday, said Jaroslava Zelinkova, police spokeswoman 
in the town 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Prague. The monument 
and headstones were erected to commemorate 41 young Jewish girls who 
were forced to work at a local textile factory during World War II 
and later were tortured by the Nazis. Zelinkova said a monument marking 
the site of a former Jewish cemetery in Trutnov also was spray-painted 
by vandals. There are some 10,000 Jews living in the Czech Republic, 
down from the 120,000 before World War II.
