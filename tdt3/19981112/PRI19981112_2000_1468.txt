Here in Britain, we are fond of talking about our special relationship 
with the United States. Eddie Mayor has written us another letter 
from London. As I have mentioned before, there is a huge fondness 
for America. At least because of our historical ties, our common language, 
our cultural similarities, and our suspicion of the French. Britain 
is fond of all things American. And your influence is seen everywhere 
here. We have imported your computer technology, your best television 
programs, your P. J. O'Rooke*, and your crime rates. It is with all 
this in mind, I was delighted to see through the mail the other day, 
a catalog. Now this time of year, we are inundated with such things 
all offering loaded Christmas wrapping paper and musical socks. I 
was about to throw this particular catalog in the trash, another word 
we have imported. When I saw through the wrapping that it was offering 
a unique collection of Americana. I have a catalog in front of me 
here. And I promise you every item I mention is real and for sale 
in British pounds. For instance, page 5, spirit of St. Louis CD boom 
box. A faithful reproduction of the type of portable field radio from 
the time when Charles Lindbergh flew nonstop across the Atlantic. 
The replica has multifunction CD. Or how about page 9, Muhammad Ali 
boxing gloves. No, not a parody of a War, but exactly the same type 
as those worn by Ali and he signed them on one glove, 400 pounds. 
There is also a stars and stripes jacket and matching baseball cap. 
Presumably so you can be seen in the dark. There is a cast iron bottle 
opener based on an original 1920s design. And best of all, here complete 
with picture, a U.S. mail box. Yes, the blurb says, get your mail 
the way millions of Americans do with the original U.S. mail box, 
made in the U.S.A., this sturdy weatherproof mailbox has the postmaster 
general's approval. Its red flag can let you know when your mail have 
been delivered, 20 pounds. Is this really how your postmaster general 
spends his time? It left me wondering do you have catalogs in America 
offering genuine warm British beer as passed by the home secretary? 
Replica member of the royal family, buy while stocks last, $50. For 
sale, British ability to forget inhibitions and get down and party, 
never been used. Eddie Mayor writes us every week from London.
