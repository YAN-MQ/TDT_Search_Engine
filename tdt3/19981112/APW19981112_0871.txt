The Christian Democrat-led minority government remained politically 
isolated Thursday when the leftist Labor Party refused to support 
the proposed national budget for next year. The right-of-center parties 
also refuse, causing a political stalemate that, in the worst case 
scenario, might force a change of the government led by Prime Minister 
Kjell Magne Bondevik. The year-old coalition of Christian Democrats, 
the Center Party, and the Liberals has just 42 seats in the 165-member 
parliament, and requires support from opposition parties to pass its 
1999 national budget by mid-December. Labor Party leader Thorbjoern 
Jagland, who stepped down as prime minister a year ago when his party 
suffered an election setback, said it quickly became obvious Thursday 
that his party and the coalition were deadlocked over the budget. 
``We knew it was going to be difficult, but we wanted to try,'' said 
Einar Steenaes, parliamentary leader of the Christian Democrats, said 
after the break with Labor. Labor, with 62 seats in parliament, has 
refused to back the budget because it includes increases in a paid 
parenting program, in which parents receive cash support to stay home 
and care for their very small children. ``From the government's side, 
there was no will to discuss the cash support,'' said Jagland. Talks 
on a budget compromise between the government and two right-wing parties, 
the Conservatives and the Party of Progress, broke off Wednesday over 
proposed tax hikes. The political right refused to accept any tax 
increases. Steenaes told the Norwegian news agency NTB that the budget 
would be sent back to parliament's finance committee for further negotiations, 
and that the government would modify the budget to reflect political 
signals from previous negotiations. The government could attempt to 
force the budget through parliament by calling a vote of confidence 
in the hope that political right, which does not want Labor to return 
to power, would give in and accept the proposal. Steenaes said he 
hoped to win support for the budget during parliament's Nov. 25 and 
26 finance debate in which the government ``will position itself to 
have the best chance of getting a majority.''
