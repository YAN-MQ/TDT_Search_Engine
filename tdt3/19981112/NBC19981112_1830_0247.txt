In Iraq, the bluster continues and the rhetoric grew even more heated 
today as that country found itself more isolated than ever. NBC's 
Ron Allen is in Baghdad tonight. Tonight, Iraq's army has been put 
on the highest state of alert, saddam Hussein as isolated as ever. 
In the past he has counted on support from his Arab neighbors, but 
not this time. In public, defiance. Deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz 
making what could be Iraq's last stand, calling the U.N. weapons inspectors 
crooks and criminals. Accusing the U.N of trying to cripple Iraq with 
harsh sanctions forever -- the reason Iraq stopped cooperating, setting 
off the crisis. Nobody has shown us the light at the end of the tunnel. 
There is a tunnel after a tunnel each time we cooperate. And work 
with Butler and his group. But behind the scenes, sources say Aziz 
is constantly telephoning u.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan, hoping 
he'll intervene, but Annan is not accepting the calls. Who is capable 
of finding a way out of this crisis? It's the secretary-general of 
the U.N. Today, more signs of Iraqis feeling the pressure -- a leading 
newspaper labeling America's threats "psychological warfare." At grade 
schools, teachers leading students in a patriotic salute to Iraq's 
army. "We hope the school doesn't get hit," she says. In the markets, 
more people hoarding supplies, prices rising. Tonight perhaps a small 
olive branch from Baghdad, Tariq Aziz hinting Iraq might allow the 
inspections to resume, if the U.N. agrees to reopen the question of 
the lifting of economic sanctions. But the United States seems completely 
unwilling to accept any ultimatums from Iraq. tom? Thank you very 
much. Ron Allen tonight in Baghdad.
