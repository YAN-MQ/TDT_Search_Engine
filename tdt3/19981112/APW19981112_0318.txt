A bomb threat on board a commercial airliner in Argentina on Thursday 
delayed the flight of Chile's President Eduardo Frei, who was headed 
to South Africa on his first official state visit. South African foreign 
affairs officials said Frei's arrival would be delayed about five 
hours, until 4 p.m. local time (1400 gmt). Frei's scheduled commercial 
flight was delayed at Ezeiza airport in Buenos Aires after an anonymous 
call about a bomb in a suitcase on the plane, said foreign affairs 
spokeswoman Adri Cronje. After a five-hour search, Argentine security 
officials allowed the plane to take off, she said. The name of the 
airline was not known. An official state banquet would be held Thursday 
night, Cronje said.
