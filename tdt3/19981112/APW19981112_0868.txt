Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi testified Thursday 
before at a court here in a probe into a suspected tax fraud at a 
Spanish television network. ``There exists a colossal misunderstanding'', 
Berlusconi told reporters before starting a five-hour questioning 
session before National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon, the state-run 
news agency EFE reported. He left the court later Thursday. The Italian 
politician and media magnate already testified July 24 and had asked 
the magistrate to postpone another questioning session to allow him 
time to study the case. Garzon is investigating the suspected 5 billion 
pesetas (dlrs 33 million) tax fraud at one of Spain's private channels, 
Telecinco, in which Berlusconi's company Fininvest had 25 percent 
of the stakes. In July, Berlusconi was given a two years and nine 
month prison term in Italy for bribing tax inspectors to obtain favorable 
audits of Fininvest company.
