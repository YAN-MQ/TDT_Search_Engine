The National Basketball Association Players Association has held a 
strategy session to plot its next course of action as the NBA lockout 
enter its 134th day Wednesday. About two dozen player representatives 
met with the union's executive committee in New York to review their 
most recent proposal and no differences with the plan offered by owners. 
Utah Jazz All-Star Karl Malone is predicting there will be a season 
when the network television contract kicks in. If I were predicting, 
and I don't have my crystal ball, but I would say the 25th of December 
when the first regular season game will be because that's NBC money, 
and those are big, big chips there. So I say Christmas Day game is 
what my prediction. Now I could be wrong, but I think there will definitely 
be a season. Players Association executive director Billy Hunter offered 
to resume negotiations with the owners but offered no new proposals. 
The two sides are at a standstill and have not spoken since Friday 
when Hunter and NBA commissioner David Stern met for around 90 minutes. 
Formal negotiations have not been held since October the 28th.
