has come a long way since Alexander Graham Bell's historic call. But 
it may go further still. From changing long distance services, to 
videophones, the telephone is evolving with each technological advance. 
Join us for the next Beyond Computers when we predict the future of 
the telephone. Tonight at 10 on 91 FM, WHYY. I am Dan Gotlieb* on 
the next Voices in the Family, we will hear the second of our two-part 
series called A Change of Heart. We will follow-up the conversation 
I had with patients waiting for a heart transplant at Temple University 
Hospital. And we will hear from a post-transplant patient and a psychologist. 
So be sure to tune in. That is Voices in the Family, Sunday morning 
at six, here on 91 FM WHYY.
