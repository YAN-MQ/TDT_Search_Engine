A bullet fired at a federal command post in North Carolina last night 
may have been an accident. But authorities are investigating as if 
it were a deliberate attack. The bullet apparently came from a nearby 
field used by deer hunters. The bullet grazed the hair of an agent, 
but did not wound him. The agents are searching for Eric Rudolph who's 
wanted in the bombing of an alabama women's clinic and three bombings 
in Atlanta, including the attack during the 1996 Olympics.
