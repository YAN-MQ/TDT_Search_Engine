Despite recent trouble in the Japanese auto industry, Honda Motor 
Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. reported impressive profit gains Thursday 
for the first half of the fiscal year. Japan's carmakers have faced 
slumping sales in the domestic market, a credit squeeze and a recent 
unfavorable swing in dollar-yen exchange rates. Earlier this week, 
Nissan Motor Co., the nation's troubled No. 2 carmaker, posted a loss 
and revised its outlook for the fiscal year from flat to negative. 
And last Friday, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced a major reorganization 
and continued losses in the first half. But Honda said Thursday that 
net profit in the first half, which ended on Sept. 30, jumped 25 percent, 
to 158.3 billion yen, or $1.28 billion, compared with 126.5 billion 
yen in the period a year earlier, thanks largely to robust sales in 
the United States. Mazda, which is controlled by Ford Motor Co. and 
trades separately, was helped by strong sales in Europe and the benefits 
of a cost-cutting program. It posted a net profit of 8.5 billion yen, 
or $69.1 million, compared with a loss of 9.7 billion yen in the period 
a year earlier. Toyota Motor Corp., the largest Japanese car company, 
will report its earnings next week and is expected to announce a profit. 
Both Honda _ which is Japan's third-largest automaker _ and Mazda 
may already be confronting a tougher environment. For one thing, the 
yen rose sharply against the dollar last month, which makes their 
exports to the United States more expensive. About 75 percent of the 
541,714 cars Honda sold in the United States in the first six months 
of the fiscal year were also made in the United States; the remainder 
of its sales came from shipments of sport utility vehicles and some 
Acura models from Japan. Although Mazda's gains came in Europe, where 
sales rose 31 percent, to 132,000 vehicles, the yen has also gained 
against European currencies in the last six weeks, which could make 
such gains in the future more difficult. And both companies said they 
would be affected by a worldwide economic slowdown. Nonetheless, Mazda 
and Honda raised their earnings predictions for the full fiscal year 
ending on March 31. Mazda said it now expected profit to rise 6.7 
percent, to 32 billion yen, or $260 million, which would be its largest 
since 1985. Honda is expecting a 7.4 percent jump in profit, to 280 
billion yen, or $2.3 billion, for the year. ``We don't see any slowdown 
in the U.S.,'' said Koichi Amemiya, president of Honda's U.S. operations.
