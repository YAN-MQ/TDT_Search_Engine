The first designer who used his name as a marketing tool, a la Ralph 
Lauren, was probably Christopher Dresser, an English designer of household 
goods in the 1800s who stamped his name on most of his products. Sadly, 
a name that had wide currency in his time has had practically none 
in ours. About 10 years ago, David McFadden, chief curator of the 
American Craft Museum, delivered a lecture on modern design. He showed 
a sleek, streamlined soup tureen and asked if anyone could identify 
its year and designer. The audience of design aficionados was stumped. 
Some guessed it was from the 1950s. In fact, it was from 1880, designed 
by Dresser. A similar tureen is on display through Dec. 18 in ``Truth 
Beauty Power: Dr. Christopher Dresser, 1834-1904,'' at Historical 
Design, a gallery at 306 East 61st Street in Manhattan. This exhibition 
is part of a renewed interest in Dresser: the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art is organizing a major Dresser exhibition for 2002, said Stewart 
Johnson, the museum's 20th-century-art curator who is organizing the 
show. Trained as a botanist, Dresser became one of the first industrial 
designers specializing in domestic objects. He worked for some 50 
firms, creating carpets, ceramics, glass, furniture, wallpaper and 
metalwork. Much of his design reflects a 19th-century enthusiasm for 
exoticism and historicism. Dresser adapted medieval styles, pre-Columbian 
shapes and ancient Egyptian, Japanese and Chinese forms. ``In that 
sense, he was typical of his age,'' said Barry Harwood, a decorative 
arts curator at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. ``Today, however, we focus 
more on his proto-modern period.'' The architectural historian Nikolaus 
Pevsner, he added, called Dresser ``a pioneer of modernism.'' Dresser's 
metalwork, in particular, looks as sleek as anything in the Art Deco 
or Vienna Secessionist style, though it is much earlier. Historical 
Design is selling 67 Dresser metalwork creations, from sweetmeat baskets 
to andirons, toast racks to tea sets, and they range from $3,750 for 
a silver letter rack to $125,000 for a 16-inch-tall claret jug in 
sterling silver, glass and ebony. ``It took 15 years to assemble this 
show,'' said Denis Gallion, the gallery's owner. ``We discovered the 
pieces one by one, in Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Europe 
and all over America.'' Fifty years before Walter Gropius founded 
the Bauhaus, when everyone in Victorian England was piling on the 
ornament, Dresser was equating functionality with beauty and producing 
reductive design. Catherine Voorsanger, a curator in American decorative 
arts at the Metropolitan, suggested that Dresser might have been influenced 
by the carafes, test tubes and utensils that he saw in laboratories 
where he worked as a youth. Gallion said, ``He was the first to understand 
the potential of the machine and how it could be used to make things 
affordable for the people.'' In ``Christopher Dresser'' (Academy Editions, 
1993), the British art historian Stuart Durant calls him ``the first 
modern product designer'' and says he ``reveled in the triumph of 
the machine.'' In this sense, he was in disagreement with his richer 
British contemporaries, like William Morris, who criticized the advances 
of the industrial age and bemoaned the lack of handwork in the production 
of goods. Dr. David A. Taylor, a scholar of material culture at the 
Library of Congress, writes in the exhibition catalog, ``In his acceptance 
of machines as highly useful vehicles for improving people's lives 
through exposure to artful domestic objects, Dresser was at odds with 
the social reformer John Ruskin and the designer and socialist William 
Morris.'' Johnson, at the Met, wondered why everyone remembers Morris 
and no one recalls Dresser. ``Our show will try to answer that,'' 
he said. Dresser was prolific in every way. He would take a basic 
geometric shape and adapt it for different uses. He particularly favored 
the cone. He used it upside down as a candlestick and right-side up 
for the bodies of tankards, silver teapots, creamers, sugar bowls 
and cruet sets. Many of his cones sit on trifooted metal stands. ``Many 
ancient cultures had huge vessels for oil that rested on such stands,'' 
Gallion said. ``Dresser's had legs in the form of crow's feet, which 
comes from ancient Egyptian culture. What's memorable is their whimsical 
nature.'' One teapot looks like a silver ostrich egg with stubby legs. 
Another resembles a silver sugar cube sitting on a square platform. 
A toast rack sports what resembles a line of silver Popsicle sticks 
marching in tight formation. Another boasts a thatch of coiled silver 
fiddlehead ferns. A silver spoon warmer could be mistaken for a model 
of a lunar landing module. Perhaps these were meant to amuse his 13 
children. The Dresser exhibition is a good primer for those attending 
the ``Modernism and Photography'' fair this weekend at the Seventh 
Regiment Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 66th Street (Friday through Sunday). 
The 70 dealers (including Historical Design) are showing Esthetic 
Movement, Art Nouveau, Vienna Secessionist, Art Deco, French 40s, 
Italian modern and American 50s furniture and decorative arts. A Baltimore 
gallery, the Fourth Quarter, has a sterling Dresser bonbon dish ($3,200) 
and a Dresser picnic tea kettle, caddy and burner ($1,200). Now that 
the Met exhibition has been announced, carpe diem. ____ One common 
problem collectors face is how to display their treasures. To address 
that, Alistair McAlpine, who was deputy chairman of the Conservative 
Party in Britain when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, has written 
``Collecting and Display,'' with Cathy Giangrande, a museum conservationist 
(Conran Octopus, 1998). McAlpine knows his subject. He has assembled, 
then dispersed several collections, including historic buildings, 
rare breeds of animals (chickens, pigs and cows), garden ornaments, 
modern paintings and vintage photographs. ``I get what I want out 
of the collections,'' he said, ``then I sell them or give them away.'' 
McAlpine is not preachy. ``You can collect whatever you like,'' he 
said. ``The fact you collect it is what makes it important, not its 
value. The problem is where to put things.'' The 240 color photos 
in the book include one of a room full of Hermes signature orange 
boxes, in precariously balanced stacks; a stair hall with swords arranged 
in complex geometric patterns, and a wall with a column of sunglasses. 
There are lists of restorers, framers, sources for display units, 
lighting specialists and conservation organizations. McAlpine is particularly 
inspired by Sir John Soane, the 18th-century neo-classical British 
architect who covered every inch of his walls with architectural fragments, 
paintings, archeological treasures, plaster busts, you name it. Soane's 
London house is now a museum. Nowadays McAlpine makes a splash wearing 
his newest collecting passion: 1960s vintage plaid suits and Pucci 
silk ties.
