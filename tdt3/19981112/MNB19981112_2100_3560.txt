keith: "the news with brian williams" is next. For all of us who prepared 
this program, I'm Keith olbermann. We thank you, we bid you goodnight. 
There is no need for further warnings to Iraq. We've been at this 
aong time. They understand our seriousness. This is a grave situation. 
Is the United States by its policy against Iraq. It has all been said 
now. The president is making his final calls to the hill as carkte 
and ships gear up for possible action. What the Pentagon says could 
be hours away in the Persian gulf. Stayedside, more men, women and 
material are moving out tonight, shipping out overseas for what could 
be another attempt to punish Iraq. Aizarre component in all this attack 
planning no one at the Pentagon has any control over. A meteor shower 
is on the way, perhaps with devastating effects on the satellites 
aimed at Iraq. And good Thursday evening to you
