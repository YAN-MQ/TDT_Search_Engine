The Vatican is helping to sponsor a film festival to promote links 
between popular culture and faith. Among the 21 films to be show for 
free at two Rome cinemas Nov. 17 through Dec. 8. are ``Winter Guest,'' 
which explores generational conflict, ``Life is Beautiful,'' the Italian 
work which just opened in the United States and which uses humor to 
recount the horror of the Holocaust and Steven Spielberg's ``Amistad,'' 
which deals with slavery. Watching the films should deepen ``the dialogue 
between faith and culture,'' Cardinal Paul Poupard said when presenting 
the festival. The cardinal added that said Pope John Paul II believes 
cinema is ``able to create moments of a extraordinary intensity.'' 
Italy's state film promotion agency is the other big sponsor of the 
second edition of the ``International Festival of Spiritual Cinema.''
