Some things to expect in a horror movie sequel: a higher body count, 
cruder shock effects, louder screams, vanishing credibility and loss 
of narrative coherence. ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' 
conforms depressingly to type. The follow-up to the phenomenally successful 
``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' is an empty, farcical blood bath 
that's virtually shock-free except for one preposterous plot twist. 
What is that ominous thudding sound inside the giant clothes dryer? 
You know what it is without even having to open the door. Maybe one 
of the kicks of a movie this bad is feeling you're ahead of the game. 
Though the original film was no horror classic, its portrait of four 
North Carolina teen-agers hunted by the victim of a supposedly fatal 
hit-and-run accident for which they were responsible produced a tingle 
of recognition. Which of us hasn't at one time or another been so 
haunted by a guilty secret that we entertain paranoid fantasies of 
imminent cosmic payback? And Jennifer Love Hewitt, as Julie James, 
the most conscience-stricken of the four, made quivering, teary-eyed 
guilt seem almost attractive. ``I Still Know'' finds Julie (Ms. Hewitt 
once again) still so obsessed with the past that she is having a fresh 
hallucination every two or three minutes. When her college roommate 
Karla (pop singer Brandy) wins a weekend trip to the Bahamas for herself 
and three friends, Julie jumps at the opportunity to go, even though 
it means leaving behind her boyfriend, Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who 
has to work. Besides, Brandy, who takes along her sassy boyfriend, 
Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), is pushing a romance between Julie and Will 
(Matthew Settle), a clean-cut classmate also on the trip, who has 
a big crush on Julie. Who knows what could blossom between the two 
while lounging side by side in a tropical paradise? But almost as 
soon as they arrive on Fourth of July weekend at a deserted hotel 
on a remote island where a hurricane is brewing, Julie's nightmares 
start coming true. It isn't long before her phantom avenger trudges 
into view wearing his trademark black rain slicker and wielding his 
trademark fishhook, ready to slash to ribbons anyone standing in his 
way. ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' isn't the end of the 
line for the series (a third movie is already in the works), but it 
deserves to be. Oh, one more thing: If you should win a contest by 
answering that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (which it isn't), 
think twice before deciding to collect your reward. Someone could 
be playing a very dirty trick. PRODUCTION NOTES: `I STILL KNOW WHAT 
YOU DID LAST SUMMER' Directed by Danny Cannon; written by Trey Callaway;
