Thirty-six years after giving John Glenn a ticker-tape parade as the 
first American to orbit the Earth, New York City will follow up with 
an encore Monday to celebrate his recent return to space at age 77. 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, announcing the event Thursday, said the procession 
for Glenn and his six crewmates would start at 11 a.m. at Hanover 
Square in lower Manhattan and move up Broadway, the traditional Canyon 
of Heroes. The parade will end at City Hall for a ceremony honoring 
the astronauts, who will be given keys to the city. The first ticker-tape 
parade in New York City was held in 1886 to commemorate the dedication 
of the Statue of Liberty. The parades have been rare in recent decades, 
with only 11 in the city since 1970. But the ticker-tape parade Monday 
will be the third in just the last month. The mayor was jubilant in 
announcing the event for the astronauts. ``This is wonderful,'' he 
said. ``I think the more ticker-tape parades I can have during the 
time that I'm mayor, the more great memories I'm going to have later 
on. These are absolutely astounding events.'' On Oct. 17, a parade 
for Sammy Sosa, the Chicago Cubs' home-run slugger, was sparsely attended 
because it was on a Saturday, when lower Manhattan is largely deserted. 
But a parade on Friday, Oct. 23, for the world champion New York Yankees, 
drew big crowds _ though probably less than the official police estimate 
of 3.5 million. Critics of the mayor said the proliferation of parades 
was evidence of illegal discrimination by his administration on whom 
it allows to march in the streets and to hold rallies at City Hall. 
In a lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Housing 
Works, an AIDS advocacy group, said police had denied the organization 
permission to hold a march of up to 1,000 people on lower Broadway 
_ ending with a demonstration against the mayor in front of City Hall 
_ on World AIDS Day, Dec. 1. ``Constitutionally, the mayor cannot 
allow events he favors while barring events he disfavors,'' said Norman 
Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, 
which represents Housing Works. The suit contends that while the city 
has raised concerns over cost and security in denying permission to 
Housing Works, the big parades for the Yankees and astronauts undercut 
those arguments. The mayor declined to estimate the cost of the Glenn 
parade, which is expected to involve thousands of extra police officers 
and extra sanitation crews for the cleanup. When asked last month 
about the cost of the Sosa parade, Giuliani said it would cost ``a 
lot of money'' but would be worthwhile because of the national publicity 
it would generate for the city. When asked why Housing Works was denied 
a parade permit, the mayor said that he was not involved in making 
those decisions but that all requests could not be granted. But, he 
said, Glenn's achievement was ``quite rare'' and deserved a parade. 
``It will be a grand celebration of a tremendous accomplishment of 
historic proportions, both John Glenn's individual accomplishment 
and the accomplishment of the entire mission,'' Giuliani said. He 
added, ``It will be very good for the young people of the city, because 
it will focus them on the importance of space exploration.''
