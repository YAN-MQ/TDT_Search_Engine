Rep. Dick Armey seemed to have a premonition of the House leadership 
meltdown two years ago when, eyeing the majority Republicans slipping 
a bit from their halcyon days of 1994, he advised: ``Let's just dare 
to be not sensational.'' This advice has become the Republican mantra 
with the removal of Newt Gingrich as House speaker, and no one is 
more aware of this than Armey. For he now must fight being purged 
as majority leader, the second to the speaker in power. A politician 
who once openly yearned to succeed Gingrich, Armey is beset from two 
sides in the leadership race: Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington state 
is coming at him from the Republicans' uneasy center, while Rep. Steve 
Largent of Oklahoma is challenging as an unabashed purist even further 
right than Armey, the born-again Christian and former economics professor 
who aims to scrap the graduated income tax. House Republicans are 
due to meet Wednesday and settle the competition among the three: 
ARMEY: Beyond his reputation as a doctrinaire conservative, the seven-term 
Texan has a taste for flamboyance, from his cowboy boots customized 
with the House seal to his raspy-edged denunciations personalized 
for Democrats. Of Hillary Rodham Clinton, he has said, ``All her friends 
are Marxists.'' When President Clinton angrily confronted him over 
this at the White House, Armey responded, ``Perhaps it's my Western 
upbringing, but I don't listen very well when someone's pointing a 
finger at me.'' After he referred to Rep. Barney Frank, a leading 
Democrat from Massachusetts who is gay, as ``Barney Fag,'' Armey had 
to apologize, but few critics believed his plea that it was an innocent 
mistake. Conservatives appreciate Armey's Agnewish combativeness, 
as when he criticized the International Monetary Fund's efforts to 
prop up tottering nations and declared, ``I've been to Europe once; 
I don't have to go again.'' But conservatives have been wary of Armey, 
too, ever since their failed coup against Gingrich in 1997 when they 
accused Armey of double-dealing in listening encouragingly to the 
insurgents, then finally alerting Gingrich. ``In my private moments 
I probably walk around the office pretending I'm Gary Cooper,'' the 
6-foot-2, 58-year-old country music buff declared half-apologetically 
last year as he tried an image makeover. ``In this position, I need 
to have a demeanor and presentation of ideas that's attractive across 
the country.'' His policy ideas often whet the White House's political 
appetite, particularly Armey's call to cut aid to education as a way 
to make it possible to end the federal gasoline tax. As majority leader, 
his line-in-the-sand effort to block any vote to raise the minimum 
wage left Republican moderates apoplectic. ``Like we say in Texas,'' 
said White House political strategist Paul Begala, ``if goofy ideas 
ever go to $40 a barrel, I want the drilling rights to Dick Armey's 
head.'' But Armey's toughness among the troops has been well demonstrated 
across the past four years and is rated a considerable strength in 
the leadership scrap. Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, who unseated 
Gingrich and is expected to replace him as speaker, had run-ins with 
Armey over fiscal matters in the past. But Livingston promised neutrality 
in the majority leader fight after Armey made a pilgrimage to pledge 
fealty. ``We're going to have a great many successes in this next 
Congress,'' Armey vowed on election night, insisting then that there 
was no reason for Republicans to panic. LARGENT: As a 44-year-old 
standout from the Contract With America class of '94, Largent brought 
to Congress his fervor as both an evangelical Christian and a professional 
football Hall of Famer. Some colleagues privately wince at some of 
his pep-rally political advice (``Perfect Preparation Prevents Poor 
Performance!''). But his conservative peers look to him for the ethical 
edge in politics. ``You know, people say _ and I believe it's totally 
false _ that you can't legislate morality,'' he has said. ``The truth 
is every piece of legislation legislates morality, whether it's a 
library fine or anything else.'' He, too, is an ardent advocate of 
ending the graduated income tax and replacing it with a single, flat 
rate. Speaking of the unfairness of Social Security to his generation, 
he has said he wants to overhaul it and eventually end it. On hot-button 
social issues, Largent opposes abortion and insists there can be no 
middle ground for lawmakers. In sponsoring the Defense of Marriage 
Act, he draws a distinction between condemning the ``sin'' of homosexuality 
while expressing Christian charity toward the ``sinner.'' As a child 
of a broken family, he says his foremost goal in politics is to rebuild 
the family. Still gridiron trim, the 5-foot-11 lawmaker holds weekly 
``accountability sessions'' with like-minded conservatives for political 
soul-searching and prayer against ``all the temptations'' of Washington. 
For all his spirituality and caucus lectures on team solidarity, Largent 
showed a keenness for the power play known in football as the crack-back 
block when he moved quickly on national television to cut down Armey 
as majority leader. Two years ago, he called on Gingrich to step aside 
while the speaker's ethics case was before the House. When Gingrich 
finally exited last week, he bitterly cautioned his successor about 
ever hoping to satisfy the ``perfectionist caucus'' that is Largent's 
power base. ``Brief But Brilliant'' is the political epitaph Largent 
once suggested for himself, and one way or another his current sprint 
for the leadership seems planned with that in mind. MS. DUNN: When 
it comes to sports metaphors, Ms. Dunn once estimated that the House 
seemed closer to hockey than football, considering the free-form brawling 
and verbal stick checking that goes on. But she warned the men of 
her party that they had better drop all allusions to sports and war 
in their political talk if they ever hope to end the gender gap in 
which women voters give an edge to Democrats. ``We are developing 
speech modules that are women friendly,'' she said earlier this year 
at a Republican women's conference. ``We need to stress what I call 
the soft edge of the conservative message.'' Armey, who made a show 
of relying on Ms. Dunn as visible front-office proof of his gender 
sensitivity, now finds himself challenged by this resilient four-term 
lawmaker respected more as a vote-savvy political technician than 
a policy purist. ``I'm someone who has broken a lot of glass ceilings,'' 
she said of her current campaign to move up. ``I was the first president 
_ first woman president of our student body _ in the sixth grade, 
and was the first woman Republican state party chairman,'' she added, 
having served 12 years as the party leader in Washington. With two 
money-dispensing political action committees to help bind her to her 
fellow Republicans, Ms. Dunn regularly attends House strategy sessions 
of both conservatives and moderates. Conservatives complain that she 
receives a favorable rating of 80 percent, not 100 percent, from the 
anti-abortion lobby. She hopes this imperfection leaves her well placed 
for the new, possibly more compromising, Livingston team. Some moderates 
privately rate her as an earnest politician painstakingly devoted 
to party message, but hardly a policy innovator. ``The message we 
got was that there was no message,'' Ms. Dunn complained of shortcomings 
that she said voters found in the last agenda of the Gingrich era. 
The 57-year-old lawmaker built her initial reputation as a hawk on 
the deficit and crime, co-sponsoring a law allowing localities to 
protect children by openly tracking ``sexual predators.'' But her 
basic message now to reeling House Republicans is that if they are 
wise, they will replace the cowboy-styled Armey not with Largent, 
a partisan rooted in football-speak, but with her, a sensitized mother 
of two. ``If we are seen as being partisan, it's going to be hurtful 
to us,'' she warned Republicans before their election drubbing. ``It's 
going to push women away.''
