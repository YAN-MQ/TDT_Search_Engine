If Helen Keller were alive today, she would probably have her own 
daytime talk show. That is one of the messages of ``Monday After the 
Miracle,'' a CBS movie to be seen on Sunday night. The other message 
is that sometimes a relationship between two people is too close to 
let anyone else share it. It seems significant that the first words 
spoken aloud by Keller (Moira Kelly) in this movie are ``How much?'' 
The question is directed to a man from The Ladies' Home Journal who 
has read her essays and has turned up at her home to persuade her 
to write a series of articles for the magazine. Annie Sullivan (Roma 
Downey), her tireless teacher, has just told the man that Keller, 
who is a full-time student at Radcliffe College, simply doesn't have 
the time to take on the project. But when he answers the question 
with ``$3,000,'' a nice little bundle at the turn of the last century, 
Keller quickly speaks her next line: ``I'll find the time.'' (This 
is a grossly sentimental movie posing as irreverent.) So it should 
come as no surprise that later in the film, when a vaudeville agent 
approaches the women, stressing that even the distinguished poet Carl 
Sandburg is doing vaudeville now, and that they can earn enough money 
in one year to last them five, they are soon packing their prettiest 
dresses and going on tour. ``My teacher's hands touched the darkness 
of my mind,'' Keller testifies to an enraptured theater audience, 
``and I awoke to the gladness of life. I am not dumb now.'' Few people 
use the word dumb these days to refer to an inability to speak, but 
most viewers know Keller's story well. It has been told in William 
Gibson's 1960 play, ``The Miracle Worker,'' and in the 1962 film of 
that play, which starred Anne Bancroft as Sullivan and Patty Duke, 
then 16, as Keller. Keller was born in Tuscumbia, Ala., in 1880 and 
lost both her sight and her hearing during an illness 19 months later. 
When she was 7, uncommunicative and often violent, Sullivan was brought 
from a school for the blind in Boston to try to teach her some means 
of connection to the world. The method: sign language, with the speaker's 
hand in the palm of the listener. Sullivan succeeded beyond all expectations, 
and Keller became a beloved public figure and an inspiring advocate 
for the blind and the deaf until her death in 1968. ``Monday After 
the Miracle'' looks at the period of Keller's life that transformed 
her again, from private citizen to star, and that settled the question 
of her personal life once and for all. The film focuses on Sullivan's 
marriage to John Macy (Bill Campbell), a relationship strained to 
the breaking point by her emotional bond with Keller, and on Keller's 
own romance, which was discouraged strongly by her family. ``That 
love will turn to duty,'' Keller's mother warns the young man, ``and 
duty will turn to resentment.'' And soon Helen is waiting, like Catherine 
Sloper in ``Washington Square,'' for her lover to whisk her away in 
the middle of the night. The real miracle in Keller's life, apparently, 
was that love never turned to duty for Annie Sullivan. This one-layered 
film never gets beyond the surface of that phenomenon, but at least 
it makes the point. PRODUCTION NOTES: `MONDAY AFTER THE MIRACLE' 9

Goldstone, co-producers; Roma Downey, Sandy Brice and Tom Todoroff,
