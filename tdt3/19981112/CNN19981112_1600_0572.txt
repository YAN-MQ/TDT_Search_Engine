The justice department is taking its case to regulate tobacco to the 
Supreme Court. The announcement was made after a federal appeals court 
upheld an earlier ruling that stated the FDA does not have the authority 
to regulate cigarette manufacturers. The regulations were designed 
by the Clinton administration to make it harder for minors to buy 
cigarettes. The tobacco industry says the FDA does not have the authority 
to make such regulations.
