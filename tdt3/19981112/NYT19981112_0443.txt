Edward Kosner, a former editor of Newsweek, New York magazine and 
Esquire, was named Sunday editor of The Daily News on Thursday. The 
Sunday edition will have a new title, The Sunday Daily News, and in 
the spirit of The London Sunday Times, will have a senior staff of 
editors and writers separate from the daily paper. Kosner will report 
directly to The News' editorial director, Harold M. Evans. Evans is 
familiar with the separate Sunday format; he was editor of The London 
Sunday Times until 1981. The move appears to represent a dilution 
of power for Debby Krenek, The News' editor in chief, because the 
previous Sunday editor had reported to her. Ms. Krenek, the first 
woman to hold the title of editor in chief at the newspaper, has been 
in that job for a little more than a year. Some Daily News reporters 
said that they were surprised by the choice of Kosner, whom they consider 
an editor skilled in the ways of the magazine world but unfamiliar 
with the vagaries of daily tabloid journalism. ``I just don't know 
how he will fit in with the green-visor culture around here,'' said 
one reporter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Kosner, 61, 
joined Newsweek as a national affairs writer in 1963, and was editor 
from 1975 to 1979. He left to become editor of New York magazine, 
and during his 13-year tenure there, the magazine won four National 
Magazine Awards. He became editor of Esquire magazine in 1993, and 
left the magazine in March of last year after failing to bolster dwindling 
circulation. Kosner, an opera buff who also collects models of vintage 
sports cars, said he would begin work next week. ``I'm going to work 
very hard and put out a lively and useful Sunday paper,'' he said. 
The Sunday edition appears to be in need of some rejuvenation. It 
is the sixth-largest Sunday newspaper in the country, but circulation 
has dropped in recent years. For the six-month period ending in September 
1998, Sunday circulation had slipped to 810,295 from 979,030 for the 
same period in 1995, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. 
Mortimer Zuckerman, the owner and co-publisher of The Daily News, 
said Thursday that the Sunday edition generated about 35 percent of 
the newspaper's advertising revenue. In the new hierarchy, the current 
Sunday editor, Bill Boyle, will become managing editor for news; he 
will continue to report to Ms. Krenek. Richard Rosen, who is now deputy 
managing editor, will be a managing editor overseeing features, sports 
and business. Arthur Browne, the current managing editor, will become 
senior managing editor for investigative reporting, a move that some 
reporters said they saw as a demotion. Browne is on vacation this 
week.
