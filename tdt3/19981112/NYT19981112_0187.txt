The songs of Rodgers and Hammerstein, which saturate ``Welcome to 
Woop Woop,'' Stephan Elliott's nightmarish satire of Australian bourgeois 
provincialism, will certainly survive being dragged through the dirt 
of this desperately unfunny farce. Whether Elliott, who made his reputation 
directing ``Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' emerges unscathed is 
another matter. The director has described ``Welcome to Woop Woop'' 
as ``a hearty wave goodbye to an old Australia before political correctness 
came in.'' That may be. But the movie, adapted from Douglas Kennedy's 
novel ``The Dead Heart,'' is an incoherent mess of thrown-together 
scenes heaping scorn and ridicule on the Australian equivalent of 
Dogpatch, U.S.A. Imagine an Australian answer to the Vicki Lawrence 
television series ``Mama's Family,'' tarted up into a frenzied drag 
show in which there isn't any actual cross-dressing, just kitsch costuming 
and acting carried beyond the pale. The story begins in New York City 
where Teddy (Johnathon Schaech), a con man selling rare Australian 
birds from the back of a truck, is forced to flee the United States 
when the stripper who is working for him goes crazy and shoots two 
men dead in the street. Flying to Australia, Teddy drives a van into 
the country's arid Northern Territory, where he picks up a sex-crazed 
hitchhiker named Angie (Susie Porter) who knocks him out, drugs him 
and takes him home to her village of Woop Woop. Upon waking up, Teddy 
discovers that while drugged he was married to Angie in a public ceremony 
and is now a prisoner. A desert shantytown surrounded by hills, Woop 
Woop is ruled by Angie's father, Daddy-O (Rod Taylor), a grizzled, 
chortling despot who has decreed that no one can leave. When one resident, 
a hairdresser married to Angie's sister Krystal (Dee Smart), tries 
to climb his way out, he is shot to death. The only industry in a 
town whose residents subsist on canned pineapple is the processing 
of dog food made from dead kangaroos and dogs. Counterbalancing the 
violence in Woop Woop is a grotesque cheeriness. Day and night, the 
music of Rodgers and Hammerstein is piped over a loudspeaker throughout 
the town. Each week the villagers _ a motley assortment of beer-guzzling, 
gun-toting hicks and half-wits worthy of ``Li'l Abner'' _ gather for 
an outdoor screening of movies like ``The Sound of Music'' or ''South 
Pacific.'' The plot, such as it is, finds Teddy leading an abortive 
protest march against the enforced pineapple diet once Daddy-O and 
his friends have been spied eating wiener schnitzel. Teddy vows somehow 
to escape. And the final chase sequence involves the sudden appearance 
of a giant, supernatural kangaroo. ``Welcome to Woop Woop'' operates 
on the principle that indiscriminate camp silliness can carry a movie. 
Maybe it can, for about a half-hour at most. ``Welcome to Woop Woop'' 
is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). 
It has sexual situations and strong language. PRODUCTION NOTES `WELCOME
