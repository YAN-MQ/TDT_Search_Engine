If this keeps up, French could become the official language of English 
soccer. The Premier League took on additional French flavor Thursday 
when Gerard Houllier assumed control of Liverpool after the departure 
of co-manager Roy Evans. Houllier, the former French national coach, 
becomes the second Frenchman as sole manager of a Premiership club. 
The other is Arsene Wenger, who guided Arsenal to the league and F.A. 
Cup double last season. ``I am not here simply to wear a suit,'' Houllier 
said Thursday. ``I will be very much involved in the team on the field. 
I will be in sole charge because that is the only way it works.'' 
Six of England's highest profiles clubs are now managed by non-Englishmen 
_ Manchester United (Alex Ferguson, Scotland), Arsenal (Wenger), Liverpool 
(Houllier), Tottenham (George Graham, Scotland), Newcastle (Ruud Gullit, 
Netherlands) and Chelsea (Gianluca Vialli, Italy). The league is full 
of non-British players from around the world. French players are in 
abundance, including Emmanuel Petit, Patrick Vieira and Nicolas Anelka 
at Arsenal, Frank Leboeuf and Marcel Dessaily at Chelsea, and David 
Ginola at Tottenham. Houllier, 51, worked early in his career as an 
English teacher and, like Wenger, had only modest success as a player, 
never playing professionally. His most successful periods as manager 
were at Lens (1982-85), where he won promotion and qualified for the 
UEFA Cup, and then at Paris Saint-Germain (1985-88), where he won 
the French championship in 1986. Houllier left PSG to become technical 
director of the French Football Federation. He took over as the French 
national team coach in 1992 from Michel Platini, but stepped down 
in 1993 when France failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in the 
United States. France looked ready to make it to the United States, 
but lost its last two matches, both at home, to Israel and Bulgaria. 
Houllier's record as French manager: seven wins, one draw and four 
defeats. Houllier, who returned to his post as technical director 
after the World Cup failure, joined Liverpool this summer as co-manager 
with Evans. The arrangement has foundered, leaving one of England's 
most storied clubs in 11th place. ``Maybe at one stage they (players) 
didn't know who was the boss _ who they had to refer to,'' Houllier 
said. Liverpool was ousted Tuesday from the League Cup 3-1 by Tottenham 
_ probably the Reds' worst game all season. It came on the heels of 
a 2-1 league loss to a modest Derby side. Houllier inherits a club 
with half a dozen world-class players. But most of the talent is up 
front, with the defense the worst in recent memory with supporters 
calling for an experienced central defender. Houllier's first match 
in control is Saturday at Anfield agaisnt Leeds. He will be without 
England midfielder Steve McManaman (achilles injury) and fellow England 
star Michael Owen, who suffered a hamstring injury in the Tottenham 
loss. McManaman's contract ends at the end of the season, with reports 
he could be headed to Spain. Houllier is also reported to have doubts 
about keeping mercurial England midfielder Paul Ince, who seems to 
be embroiled in one red-card suspension after another.
