Finally tonight, it's "the news without" and the scourge of performance 
enhancing drugs has hit sports again. First perhaps it was Ben Johnson 
at the 1988 Olympics, then Mark McGwire and androstenedione this year. 
Now it's jun soka Inouye of the Japanese national team who's been 
thrown outs of the Asian games which begin the 6th of next month by 
Japan's olympic committee. The J.O.C. says he tested positive for 
methylestosterone, a male hormone which has effects similar to testosterone 
and is believed to build muscle mass. The committee says he admitted 
to using an over-the-counter drug containing methylestosterone in 
homes of building up his energy level. So what, you're saying? Here's 
the -- here's the push line, the squad from his jun soka Inouye has 
been banned was the Japanese national billiards team. Jun soka Inouye 
is a pool player. He's also 58 years old and he's taking a form of 
testosterone to help him bank the 6 ball into the left corner. Next,
