The unfortunate title of Eric Bross' first feature film, ``Ten Benny,'' 
is a slang term for the alleged shoe size of Paul Newman. Oh, don't 
ask why. It's not worth getting into, other than to note that the 
movie's leading character, Ray (Adrien Brody), is miserable in his 
dead-end job working in a shoe store in Bloomfield, N.J. The only 
son of a petty mobster who a decade earlier spent a year in jail after 
being caught operating an illegal casino out of his suburban basement, 
Ray lives at home with his father, Ray Sr. (Frank Vincent), who now 
ekes out a living running a home-repair business. Hotheaded and foulmouthed, 
Ray is forever squabbling with Joanne (Sybil Temchen), his girlfriend 
of three years, who works as a waitress while waiting for Ray to propose 
marriage. ``Ten Benny,'' which is narrated by Ray's best friend, Mike 
(Michael Gallagher), is the story of Ray's last-minute attempt to 
score enough money gambling at the racetrack to set himself up in 
business. The moment he borrows $10,000 from a menacing mobster, Donny 
(James E. Moriarty), Ray begins a humiliating and utterly predictable 
downward spiral that finds him taking increasingly desperate measures 
to pay back the money, which he loses in a colossally misplaced bet. 
Before he hits bottom, Ray has been beaten up more than once and betrayed 
by his best friend. He mopes through much of the last third of the 
movie sporting a black eye. There isn't a shred of dialogue in ``Ten 
Benny'' that doesn't sound exactly like that found in a dozen other 
films about working-class Italian-American life, nor is there a character 
who doesn't seem entirely stereotypical. If the movie succeeds in 
feeling real, the reality it portrays seems stale and rehashed. None 
of the issues it explores _ father-son conflict, the testing of friendship, 
working-class machismo _ is examined more than superficially. ``Ten 
Benny,'' which opens Friday at the Angelika Film Center, has one notable 
asset in Brody, a gifted performer who bears an astonishing physical 
resemblance to the equally talented French actor Gregoire Colin. Brody 
doesn't stint on nastiness. His wiry, gimlet-eyed Ray is a thoroughly 
disagreeable package of puffed-up self-delusion programmed for puncture. 
At the slightest hint of frustration, the character goes ballistic, 
becoming so disgustingly abusive to his girlfriend that you can hardly 
wait for him to get his comeuppance. ``Ten Benny'' is rated R (Under 
17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, 
abundant profanity and one sex scene. PRODUCTION NOTES: `TEN BENNY'
