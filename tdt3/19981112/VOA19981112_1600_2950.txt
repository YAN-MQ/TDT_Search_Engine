Well, goodbye to a three-day losing streak. It's history. The Dow 
Jones ended up today six points, closing at 8829, but it was a mixed 
day. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index more broadly based lost three 
points to close at 1117. Analysts are saying Wall Street lacks energy, 
traders are waiting to see what happens in the Persian Gulf. Will 
the U.S. strike Iraq? Also, there's some uncertainty over whether 
the U.S. Central Bank will cut interest rates again when it meets 
next Tuesday, actually, November 17th. Meanwhile, oil stocks rose 
today as did gold over the Iraq situation, perhaps only a short-term 
boost since there seems to be plenty of oil out there to meet demand. 
So say the experts. Once again, Dow Jones moving up and closing at 
six points at 8829. This Elaine Johannsen, and good night.
