With the government signaling that wages and pension payments will 
be slashed, Singapore's homegrown business star Creative Technology 
said Thursday it will compensate its employees by returning cuts in 
the form of bonuses. The world's leading PC sound card maker will 
create a bonus plan to return potentially all of the planned 50 percent 
reduction in employers' contributions to the mandatory state-run pension 
fund. The reaction to the government-orchestrated wage and pension 
cuts from one of Singapore's highest profile businesses was a surprise. 
While the company supports recent recommendations to reduce business 
costs in Singapore, ``we are also mindful of the past and ongoing 
contributions of our staff who _ during the last year _ have helped 
Creative weather difficult business conditions and prosper,'' said 
chief executive officer Sim Wong Hoo. The multimedia component maker 
said its response to a government-convened committee's recommendations 
to halve company contributions to the Central Provident Fund from 
20 percent of a worker's salary to 10 percent would be the ``Creative 
CPF Bonus Plan.'' The special bonus will be paid after the current 
fiscal year ends June 30, 1999, though it will depend on the company 
meeting its targets. ``Rewarding and further motivating this staff 
is crucial to Creative because, as a world class, knowledge-based 
company, we believe we stand to gain enormously from a highly motivated 
work force,'' said Sim, who steered his company from a small start-up 
enterprise into one of the world's most successful computer product 
innovators. Creative's annual wage costs in Singapore are about 50 
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 30 million). The company employs between 
1,500 and 2,000 workers depending on seasonal demand.
