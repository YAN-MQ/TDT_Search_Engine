And we now head southwest for today's geography stumper. Since the 
early 1980s, our mystery location has been considered one of the nation's 
sheikest places to visit and live. It is one of America's oldest cities, 
founded by Spanish missionaries. They turned it into their northern 
most colonial capital a full decade before the Pilgrims landed on 
Plymouth Rock. Today this city boasts the nation's oldest public building, 
the palace of the governors, and the oldest church still in use, the 
San Miguel Mission. Spread across a high plateau at the foot of the 
San Grede Cristo* Mountains, this capital has been a magnet for tourists, 
artists, and escapists. It is packed with art galleries, new age spas, 
where are we? Well, relax, breathe deeply, the answer will come to 
you in a few minutes.
