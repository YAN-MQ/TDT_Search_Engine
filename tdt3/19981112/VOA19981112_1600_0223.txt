Russians parliamentary leaders say they're optimistic the lower House 
will soon ratify the long-stalled Start 2 Arms Treaty with the United 
States. The speaker of the Duma says a new version of the bill has 
been drawn up and is ready for consideration. Start 2 would cut Russian 
and U.S. nuclear arsenals in half to 3500 warheads each. The treaty 
was signed by both nations in 1993, and the U.S. Senate ratified it 
in 1996.
