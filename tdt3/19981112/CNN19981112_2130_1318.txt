Joe torre captured American league manager of the years honors in 
the same way his Yankees dominated the 1998 season, he steam rolled 
to victory, easily beating out Boston's jimy Williams by being the 
only manager named on every ballot. With the number of games we won 
this year and then with the postseason we had, then to get this award, 
it's just been a great year for me.
