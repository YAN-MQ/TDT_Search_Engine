Veteran Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, who has helped Manchester 
United to four Premier League titles in six years, announced Thursday 
that he's leaving the club at the end of the season. Schmeichel, who 
is rated as one of the world's top 'keepers, said he can't cope any 
longer with the rigors of English soccer and hopes to continue his 
career in another country. Two French clubs, Olympique Marseille and 
Monaco, have been linked with the 34-year-old Danish international. 
``I am enjoying the game as much as ever but it is getting harder 
to keep pace,'' Schmeichel told a news conference at Old Trafford. 
``I need to train more than I have ever had to. And in order to prepare 
myself properly, I need more time between games than I can get in 
England. ``I certainly need more than 12 days' summer holiday. Unfortunately, 
the demands of the game here mean that I cannot get the time I need, 
which is something I truly regret.'' Despite speculation about a move 
to France, Schmeichel insisted he hasn't yet decided on his post-United 
future. ``It is important that I am now allowed to concentrate totally 
on playing for United,'' he said. ``I have had a fantastic career 
with United and I owe it to the club, players and fans to do everything 
I can to finish on a successful note.'' Marseille seems a logical 
next stop for Schmeichel. On Wednesday, German 'keeper Andreas Koepke 
announced he was quitting the French club amid speculation of a move 
to Glasgow Rangers. Schmeichel, who joined United from Danish side 
Brondby in 1991, has played a key role in making United the most successful 
English club of the 1990s. He has helped the Red Devils win four Premier 
League championships in the last six years, two FA Cups and the League 
Cup. Last February against Derby, he became the first goalkeeper to 
register 100 shutouts in the Premiership. ``Peter Schmeichel has been 
a major player in the success achieved by Manchester United over the 
past eight years,'' manager Alex Ferguson said Thursday. ```He has 
been a model professional who has inspired and influenced everyone 
with Manchester United. ``It is his professional attitude that has 
led him to make this decision and while I know it has been a difficult 
for Peter to make, I respect and fully support him.'' Schmeichel, 
who has made more than 300 appearances for United, has been under 
increased scrutiny this season because of his age, injuries and crucial 
blunders. The Dane's mistake in the last minute of United's Champions 
League game against Bayern Munich in September cost the club a victory. 
Schmeichel, who turns 35 next week, has also been dogged by injuries 
recently and has missed two games this season with back trouble. United 
has been reportedly searching for a successor to Schmeichel and has 
been consistently linked with Aston Villa's Australian goalkeeper 
Mark Bosnich. Schmeichel's current backup at United is 35-year-old 
Dutch 'keeper Raimond van der Gouw. United's other 'keeper is 20-year-old 
Nicky Culkin, who has yet to play a League match for the senior side. 
Schmeichel, the starting 'keeper for Denmark during the World Cup 
in France, has been capped a national record 107 times, three more 
times than Michael Laudrup.
