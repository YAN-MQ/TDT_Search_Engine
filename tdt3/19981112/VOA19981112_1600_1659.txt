Many of our local FM and medium wave affiliates are about to take 
a two-minute break. This is VOA News Now. Here at VOA, we like to 
keep you informed around the clock. And now, let's give you a tour 
around the clock. This is going to be an outline of a typical hour 
of VOA News Now. First of all, we bring you a complete world news 
update at both the top and bottom of every hour. If you're interested 
in news from across the USA, be listening at 14 minutes after the 
hour universal time. Learn how your favorite athletes and teams are 
doing by tuning in to our sports update at 18 minutes after each hour. 
And during the business week, get the latest financial figures during 
our business report at 49 minutes past. Now all those times are universal 
time, and they bear repeating. So let's do that. A complete world 
news update at both the top and bottom of every hour. American news 
at about 14 minutes past the hour. Sports reports at 18 minutes past. 
And business news at 49 minutes past. Using a properly equipped computer 
linked to the Internet, you don't have to miss a minute. Just log 
on to the Voice of America Web site. That's where you can hear VOA 
News Now 24 hours a day and you can read the news as we reported by 
our correspondents. So if you have a pen or pencil and a piece of 
paper and you want to jot down this Internet address, you can do that, 
and I'll give you that address. It's www.voa.gov. Again, that's www.voa.gov. 
Stay tuned now as the news continues on VOA News Now. It's 21 hours, 
30 universal time, and this is VOA News Now.
