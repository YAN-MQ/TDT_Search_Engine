New York state hospitals have achieved the lowest death rate for coronary 
artery bypass surgery in the eight years that state officials have 
been monitoring the procedure, a high-risk form of open-heart surgery 
in which a machine temporarily takes over the functions of the patient's 
heart. Among the 32 hospitals statewide allowed to perform cardiac 
surgery, the average death rate per 100 patients dropped to 2.44 in 
1996, the latest year for which data are available, from 2.52 the 
year before. Moreover, the rate has fallen from an average of 3.52 
in 1989, which represents a decline of more than 30 percent since 
then. Looked at another way, more than 97 percent of the patients 
who underwent the 20,078 operations statewide in 1996 survived. It 
takes a year to collect, verify and evaluate hospital information 
for the annual survey, said Wayne Osten, 49, the state Department 
of Health official who directed the study. One of the toughest tasks, 
he said, is coming up with statistical measurements so that different 
hospitals, with patient populations that have varying degrees of illness, 
can be compared fairly. Kenneth Raske, a hospital administrator and 
president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said New York 
state's data is by far the most comprehensive of any state's. ``What 
is striking about the report,'' he said, ``is that the risk has dropped 
so dramatically that this major surgery now looks almost mundane.'' 
In coronary artery bypass graft surgery, arteries from the chest or 
veins from the legs are removed and used to divert, or bypass, blood 
around vessels too blocked to deliver blood efficiently to the heart 
muscle. A heart-lung machine functions as the patient's heart during 
surgery. The procedure is considered riskier than a pacemaker insertion 
but less risky than a heart transplant. The best-performing hospital 
in the survey, for the third year in a row, was St. Joseph's Hospital 
Health Center in Syracuse. In 812 bypass operations performed in 1996, 
seven people died, for a raw death rate of 0.86 percent and an adjusted 
rate of 1.1 percent. The adjusted rate assumes that St. Joseph's patient 
population looked exactly like the statewide mix, which it did not. 
``We do seemingly small things,'' said Dr. Mehdi Marvasti, St. Joseph's 
director of cardiac surgery. For example, if a patient has had a stroke, 
a stroke specialist examines him before the operation to reduce the 
probability that he will have another stroke following, or even during, 
surgery, Marvasti said. After the operation, St. Joseph's four senior 
cardiac surgeons do their hospital rounds together so that all know 
something about every cardiac patient, Marvasti said. ``If I miss 
something, then another doctor might see it,'' he said. ``It's three 
additional pairs of eyes.'' The worst-performing hospital was Arnot 
Ogden Medical Center in Elmira. Six patients out of 135 cases in 1996 
died, giving the hospital a raw death rate of 4.44 percent and an 
adjusted rate of 5.93 percent. ``Our small number of cases plays havoc 
with the statistics,'' said Anthony Cooper, president of Arnot Ogden. 
``Just to give you one example, one patient was operated on in 1995 
but died in 1996. If he had died in 1995, our score would have improved 
by 15 percent.'' Taking into account the different numbers of operations 
performed and different patient populations, 29 of the 32 hospitals 
have broadly similar death rates within a statistically significant 
margin of error. Three _ St. Luke's-Roosevelt, St. Vincent's and Lenox 
Hill, all in Manhattan _ were beyond that margin but not by a large 
degree. The report is available online at http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/consumer/heart/homehear.htm.
