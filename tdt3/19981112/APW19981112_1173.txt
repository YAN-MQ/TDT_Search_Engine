The family of the terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal said Thursday 
that France is largely to blame for his nine-day hunger strike in 
a Paris prison. The Venezuelan-born Illich Ramirez Sanchez, 49, once 
one of the world's most wanted terrorists, is angry because authorities 
have kept him in solitary confinement for four months, confiscated 
letters sent to him and blocked him from taking French classes, his 
brother said. ``We aren't asking for preferential treatment. We simply 
ask that (his) human rights be respected,'' Vladimir Ramirez Sanchez 
told reporters. His brother has refused food and water since Nov. 
3 because of alleged mistreatment at La Sante prison, where he is 
serving a life sentence for the 1975 murders of two French investigators 
and a Lebanese national. Venezuela's ambassador to France, Francisco 
Kerdel Vegas, who is a doctor, visited Ramirez in prison and confirmed 
that his health is deteriorating dangerously, Venezuela's Foreign 
Ministry said. ``If my brother dies, the only one responsible will 
be the government of France,'' said Vladimir Ramirez, adding that 
Carlos is ``prepared to die.'' The Venezuelan government has asked 
France to ensure that Ramirez's rights are respected _ a request the 
French are reviewing, according to Venezuela's Foreign Ministry. France 
has not commented publicly. Ramirez was linked to the spectacular 
1975 seizure of OPEC ministers in Vienna, Austria, and the 1976 hijacking 
of an Air France jet to Uganda. French agents snared him in Khartoum, 
Sudan, on Aug. 15, 1994, and then hauled him to Paris in a sack.
