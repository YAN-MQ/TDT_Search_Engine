The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40 points to 8,824 Wednesday. 
The S&P lost seven points to 1,121. The NASDAQ composite dropped a 
modest three points to 1,862. U.S. markets had gained earlier on the 
day on news that computer chip maker Intel would be reporting a boosted 
fourth quarter earnings because of rising demand in computer chips. 
But the gains were eaten away as the session wore on.
