Some might find it surprising that on a team that won 114 regular-season 
games and 11 more in the post season, including four straight in the 
World Series, it's likely that only one member will be awarded a major 
individual honor: Manager Joe Torre. But it was not so odd to Torre, 
who was named the American League manager of the year Thursday. ``It's 
not strange when you look at our club,'' said Torre, who was co-manager 
of the year with Texas' Johnny Oates in 1996 and who won the National 
League version of the award with Atlanta in 1982. ``I've been comparing 
our club to the old Celtics, where everyone scored 16 to 18 points 
a game and worked well as a unit.'' That unit may not be exactly the 
same next season for Torre, who has now guided the Yankees to two 
World Series championships in his three years as manager. Torre is 
well aware that his best player, Bernie Williams, may sign elsewhere. 
At Yankee Stadium Thursday, Torre said he hoped that his free-agent 
center fielder would base his decision on ``something more than dollar 
signs'' in ``what could be the last contract of his career.'' Torre, 
who last spoke to Williams at the Yankees' victory parade, said he 
has told Williams just that. He said he also told his center fielder 
he is available for him if he has any questions. ``You have to weigh 
what everything means,'' Torre said. ``But don't minimize the comfort 
zone.'' Part of that comfort zone obviously has to do with the 58-year-old 
Torre, who received 23 of the 28 first-place votes in balloting by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. But that might not be 
enough to keep Williams with the Yankees. ``I guess the realization 
of the chance he wouldn't be back started a couple of years ago,'' 
Torre said. ``And if he won't be back, we had a great three years 
together. You can't ask for much more.'' Except, perhaps, someone 
like Brian Jordan to replace Williams, should Williams leave the Yanks. 
Torre managed Jordan with the St. Louis Cardinals. Torre said he thought 
he had a good relationship with Jordan then. He remembered the outfielder, 
who also played in the National Football League, as ``a very aggressive 
young man.'' ``Unfortunately,'' Torre said, ``I had to send him out 
to the minors a couple of times.'' Jordan has mostly played right 
field during his career. But, Torre said, that was because the Cardinals 
always had Ray Lankford. ``I know Brian can play center field,'' Torre 
said, adding that he will probably be with General Manager Brian Cashman 
next week when Cashman meets with Jordan, who has been extended an 
invitation to Yankee Stadium. And so, it seems, Torre is moving on 
_ with or without Williams. ``I understand where Bernie has to take 
it all in,'' Torre said. ``But if you wait too long, you wind up with 
an empty Christmas tree.'' For his part, Torre will probably get a 
contract extension soon. ``I think we're very close,'' said Torre, 
whose 302 victories with the Yankees are the second-most three-year 
total of any manager in franchise history (Ralph Houk's teams won 
309). ``It hasn't been talked about with everything else going on. 
But I don't anticipate there will be a problem.'' ``I'm very happy 
for Joe,'' Steinbrenner said of Torre's award. ``This is a richly 
deserved honor. Joe has done an outstanding job for the Yankees and 
we have a great rapport. This has been a great association.'' Torre 
said: ``George is going to fix it if it's broke. The great thing about 
working with him is that he wants to win and needs to win.'' And that 
is exactly what Torre has done with the Yankees. His record with them 
is 302-184. Torre has guided the Yankees to the postseason in each 
of his first three seasons with them, something only Casey Stengel 
and Houk had done. Torre was 894-1,003 in his managerial career before 
joining the Yankees; his career record as manager is now 1,196-1,187. 
As for Thursday's honor, Torre was gracious. ``What makes me a pretty 
good manager is pretty good players,'' Torre said. ``You can't win 
the Derby on a quarter horse.''
