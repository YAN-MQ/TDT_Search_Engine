I'm meteorologist Dave Hennen with your "CNN Headline News Weather." 
Cold temperatures today through the upper midwest, where it will not 
go above freezing in parts of northern Minnesota. Look for warm temperatures 
to remain, though, in the southeast and back in through south Florida, 
some 80-degree high temperatures expected there today. Forecast weather 
maps later today on into Friday showing much of the lone star state 
will see some wet weather. There are flash flood watches in effect 
for parts of south Texas. High pressure building into the northeast. 
The winds will subside today. As wet weather continues in the pacific 
northwest, some higher-elevation snows are anticipated. The extended 
forecast, as we check out the weekend, we'll see showers and storms 
in portions of the southeast and back down to the gulf coast. And 
the Great Lakes will see some wet weather, as well. Rain in the pacific 
northwest likely from Seattle to Portland and even into northern California 
on Saturday. Sunday, more wet weather for the northwest. We'll find 
showers scattered in the southeast. Some snow possible in parts of 
eastern Canada as temperatures continue warm in the southwest and 
still on the cold side over the northern Great Lakes. By Monday, again, 
threat for rain in the east. For more weather information, log into
