The World Trade Organization could give more generous access terms 
to the poorest countries but should avoid short cuts, former New Zealand 
premier Mark Moore, a candidate to lead the trade watchdog, said Thursday. 
The 132-member WTO ``has to look more like the world it represents,'' 
Moore told reporters. Some 30 nations have applications under consideration. 
But countries must enter ``based on the principles of the organization,'' 
he said. Moore, 49, is one of four candidates to replace outgoing 
WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero, who will step down by the end 
of April. All are facing trade ambassadors in Geneva this week. A 
former leader of the center-left Labor Party, he was prime minister 
in 1990 and remains a lawmaker and opposition foreign affairs spokesman. 
``With some good management and a lot more listening we can do a better 
job'' of making the case for free trade, he said. ``The first job 
is to make sure we don't reverse and go backward.'' The leadership 
contest will be decided by consensus rather than a vote and the WTO 
general council hopes to confirm the appointment by the end of this 
year. Also running are former Moroccan trade minister Hassan Abouyoub, 
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and former Canadian 
trade minister Roy Maclaren.
