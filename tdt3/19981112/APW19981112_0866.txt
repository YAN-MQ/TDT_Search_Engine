Canadian Daniel Nestor reduced the number of seeds in the Stockholm 
Open to only three Thursday, ousting No. 4 Cedric Pioline of France 
in three sets. Nestor, ranked only 115th on the ATP Tour computer, 
beat the sixth-seeded Frenchman 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 to reach the quarterfinals. 
Nestor's victory came less than 24 hours after Jason Stoltenberg upset 
top-ranked Pete Sampras in a first-rund match. Other seeded players 
who have lost include Slovakia's Karol Kucera (2), defending champion 
Jonas Bjorkman (5) of Sweden and former two-time Stockholm Open winner 
Thomas Enqvist (8), also of Sweden. Pioline, a former U.S. Open and 
Wimbledon finalist who is 16th on the ATP Tour list, failed to take 
advantage of five break points when tied at 2-2 in the decisive set. 
Nestor finally held, firing an ace past Pioline and then hitting another 
good first serve that the Frenchman couldn't return. Both players 
then held their serves, but Pioline fell behind 15-40 in the eighth 
game. Pioline saved the first break point. But Nestor capitalized 
on a lucky net cord on the second, Pioline's return sailing long. 
Nestor, who was only broken once in the match, then closed out the 
set. In the quarters, Nestor will play the winner between fourth-seed 
Greg Rusedski of Britain and Vince Spadea of the United States, who 
met in Thursday's second centercourt match in the Royal Tennis Hall. 
In other second-round matches, Jason Stoltenberg of Australia played 
Hendrik Dreekmann of Germany and American qualifier Geoff Grant faced 
Thomas Johansson of Sweden.
