President Clinton is poised to order punishing air strikes against 
Iraq at any time administration officials say. They cite mounting 
indications the Iraqis are not planning to back down. We continue 
to hope, indeed pray, that Saddam will comply. But we must be prepared 
to act if he does not. The president said that without U.N. weapons 
inspections, the iraqis could rebuild their chemical, biological and 
nuclear weapons capabilities within only a few months. Top national 
security advisers continue meeting at the White House. They say they 
have nearly given up on resolving this latest stand-off peacefully 
amid no indications Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is ready to back 
down as he did last February when U.S. secretary general Kofi Annan 
met with him in Baghdad. As a precaution, the state department has 
ordered nonessential diplomatic personnel and their families to leave 
both Kuwait and Israel, faring possible Scud missile retaliation. 
That possibility is remote, U.S. officials say. But they acknowledge, 
they don't know how many scuds the Iraqis have, nor if the missiles 
could be tipped with chemical or biological weapons. Wolf Blitzer, 
CNN, the White House.
